We had an extraordinary Sunday brunch just yesterday at Town Restaurant, Riverside. All the food delicacies were so so yummy from the seafoods, salads, sushis, hot main course, yummy cheese, and desserts and also not forgetting the self making bloody Mary station. All were so well organized and so delicious. Now Coming to the main part enjoying the food with free flow of chilled champagne and wines and frozen margaritas. Two staffs we would be very very thankful Mohammad and Azman. They made our day memorable by their quality service and friendliness. They organized a birthday cake with singing band singing birthday song for my son Alex which was surprising we didn't know about that coming. It was a very big surprise. Then Mohammad brought us the family photo and a small Fullerton bear gift. My son was very happy.Thank you Azman and Mohammad for making our day

We where there with friends it to drink a Singapore sling and enjoying the view from the terrace. It's a beautiful location to sit down and pure enjoy. The staff is super friendly and have attention for all the customers. We will certainly back for a lunch dinner or only a drink
3
Food, ambience and service at the Town restaurant was ok except for the payment issue which was resolved efficiently by the restauant manager
3
The restaurant does not lack ambience or atmosphere. Welcoming staffs and service crew. Variety of food is fantastic for the price unfortunately there seems to be a sacrifice in terms of quality. This is my first time there enjoyed the experience but not so the food
4
We sat outside this restaurant alongside Singapore river, and enjoyed a couple of drinks while watching the world go by. It was a very pleasurable way to spend and hour or so...Service was was pleasant, and the ambience perfect on a warm, if humid, afternoon.The views from out table were relaxing, gazing across to the green nature on the other side of the river, and the setting informal, so overall this was a very pleasant experience, so much so that we repeated the experience the following day.As an aside, we are staying at this hotel (The Fullerton), and our breakfast experience at this same restaurant was exceptional: staff were amazingly attentive and efficient, friendly and helpful. I can’t think of any hotel where we have experienced such high standards of service during breakfast, and if this is anything to go by, I expect other meals would be delivered with the same levels of attentiveness
5
It is fine dining restaurant with tables inside and outside overlooking river with tables for smokers and non smokers there. We were surprised when waiter remembered us from our visit last winter. Buffet table is extremely rich with seafood dishes, variety of vegetables and oriental meals. Wine list is very short- just one sort of different grapes wines. This place is worth to visit for dinne
4
Came here with a few friend to celebrate birthday. The buffet spread was adequate with a mixture of local and international food. We sat outside and had a great view of the Singapore river (and bridges).
2
Service was poor, staff was not attentive and the restaurant was under staff. Food selection was limited, the quality was below expectation given it was a five star hotel

I was here with my family for Christmas Eve buffet dinner with free flow champagne and wines, a few days ago, and we were so glad that we chose to have our special dinner here! Staff were warm, friendly and accommodating. The food choices were plenty, with fresh lobsters and delicious roasted meats too. Didn't make room for desserts, but they looked pretty! Some of the dishes that I enjoyed: foie gras, fresh sashimi, marinated tuna, and fresh Boston lobsters!Even though there were many diners, we didn't feel like our table was too close to the next one. Food got replenished very quickly. You can choose to sit outdoors, facing the river, or indoors. Reservation is a must to avoid disappoinment. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a memorable experience for special dinners, to come here. It costs $208++ per pax for Christmas Eve dinner, but I feel like it is good value, considering how much champagne we indulged in, for this dinner! Two thumbs up

Words like disastrous, glamour-less, chaos, disappointing, poorly planned spring to mind to describe what was meant to be a repeat of a wonderful experience but turned out to be like eating a pie at an overcrowded Football match. To the management: your short term goals in trying to get into the Guinness book of records for cramming as many people as possible into your restaurant may have worked in the short term but my discussions with my friends, family and other diners that had Xmas brunch 2017 were that it failed miserably to meet expectations.Shellfish: inedible, chewy, Uber cookedOysters: none ( huge disappointment)BBQ: thrown together, minimal choice, poorly presented and cooked,Japanese: like trying to get on an MRT in rush hourRoast beef: probably the largest I have seen but tasteless Waiting staff: excellent and did wellWaiting staff uniforms: dreadful. 2 piece green trouser suits like those that are worn in Hospitals by nursing staffWithout doubt this has been the worst dining experience I have had in a Long time and as a Long time supporter and advocate of dining at the Fullerton town restaurant I won’t be back as it’s gone from outstanding to very poor in my opinion. There are far better champagne brunch dining opportunities available in Singapore without wasting the me and money on this foodcourt scru
5
Food selection was great and customer service is wonderful too. Staffs are attentive. For the service and food, definitely worth it
4
Had Christmas dinner with a group of colleagues. Overall very nice and good service, - several great dishes - but nothing really spectacular. And your get the feeling you pay more for location and the place than the food.
4
Food and service was good. My friends from overseas love this restaurant and the ambience there as it brings back memories for him.
1
there's no record at the restaurant record desk and that's totally horrible especially when we have make a reservation on their website
5
The restaurant provide a verity of local and international food with good dinning environment.
Reservation is recommended to avoid disappointment .
4
I was here with my friends for dinner. I like the food and the BBQ stuff. However, it seems that there is a lack of manpower. Most of the time, plates are not cleared and drink is not topped up. Overall, I am still enjoyjing.
2
The variety is much lesser now. No oysters on a sat night, although thereâ€™s lobster included. Laksa was quite bland. Only choices for hot beverages was coffee/tea, used to have more or espresso/latte etc. service was good tho
5
We had several meals (breakfast, lunches and a dinner) and they were all good. Staff is super friendly and accommodation. Having a lunch outside with a view on the Singapore river was also nice
4
The breakfast buffet was awesome. I like the traditional local cuisines to complement the rich culture of the country. Ambience is pretty good. 4 stars because it felt like it really lacked staff. I waited for a few things.
4
brought my parents there to celebrate a birthday. both were impressed w the spread and selection which catered to both local and international taste. personally loved the chicken rice.. it was so good.
3
The buffet looked good and certainly offered plenty of choice. However, it really was fairly average, nothing really to get excited about. I know it is hard for a buffet venue, but maybe work on less choice, more focus.
5
It was value for money and the selection was plentiful. Nice place to go as it is not too pricey either.
4
Whilst not our most memorable dining experience, it was nevertheless a good one on all three occasions. The attentiveness of the staff to meet our vegetarian needs, was what set it apart from other dining establishments. I would recommend the buffet for dinner, as four individual dishes add up to about the same amount, without the range and desserts, cheese etc. Nevertheless, our a la carte meals were tasty and fresh, and served promptly. It is just so convenient when under the weather, to not have to go out in the heat searching for food!!! We would eat here again, every time
5
Town is the buffet restaurant at The Fullerton Hotel. It offers both indoor and outdoor dining and offers tastes of authentic Singaporean food and additional dishes to keep everyone happy, including a sushi counter and wonderful king prawns. The centre display is very much 'hawker' in set up, but of course the food is much better. I had a wonderful dinner here which was themed for Halloween. Buffet can include beer and soft drinks and if you settle for this option, you can also have a complimentary Singapore sling.If you sit outside you get great views of the illuminated Cavanagh and Anderson Bridges. Wifi is available. Great ambiance. By Singapore rates, this is fine dining for less than $100 which must represent good value. Good supply of taxis outside and if your still thirsty the hotel has Post Bar - just right for one for the road
4
Overall experience is great. Staff are very attentive, always smile when they have eye contact with you. It was a birthday dinner for my husband, a cake is prepared and they took our photo and developed it straightaway for us to bring home. Very thoughtful. Thank you so much.
5
The quality of hr food was really good! Went for a birthday dinner celebration and the birthday girl even got a slice of cake and a card with a picture from the service staff! Def be back for special occasions ☺
3
Went as part of a group tour for dinner.Pros:1. service was excellent and staff were friendly and attentive2. despite the fact this was a buffet, a special vegetarian option was made for me because of my allergies.3. All of the seafood and sushi lovers in my group were in heaven. Kept raving about how good everything was and they all seemed to stock up on multiple offerings.4. Nice decor5. several choices and food stationsCons:1. I didn't find the local dishes and the Indian cuisine to be that flavourful. There were not a lot of beef options, and since most places in Singapore are Halal and do not serve pork, beef is the only meat that I can eat. The beef had an odd taste...almost gamy like lamb or goat.2. Since I didn't care for the local food, I tried the pasta and pizza bar. I didn't think anything was overly flavourful there either. The pizza was just OK.3. There were lots of desserts that were well presented, but everything was too sweet or just not memorable.Overall, the service was great, but the food was mediocre at best. If you don't like seafood or are allergic to it, this is not the best buffet for you
5
We were very well taken care of by Chloe and colleague near the pizza station (where we were seated) They were very attentive and ensured that our glasses were always filled up and plates were always cleared. As it was my father’s 60th bday, the restaurant was very kind to arrange for some colourful balloons to decorate where we seated. We were then gifted a slice of chocolate cake with a lit candle (: I have always enjoyed the buffet at Town and I’m glad my family enjoyed it too (

Every time I am in Singapore on a Sunday I book the Fullerton champagne brunch. I like it enough to alter travel plans to fit it in.The food is sensational from sashimi to Boston lobsters and crab claws. There is also a large selection of Asian and western dishes and a super sweets bar, but my favourite after the seafood is the cheese table with 100's of cheeses from around the world.To top off the experience is a bottomless glass of champagne, this time it was veuve clicquot, which is provided for 3 hours!The service is slick but not obtrusive, the ambiance is wonderful and the experience is worth every cent of the $S158 charge. It may seem a lot to some, but it is in fact an amazing bargain.I will be back again with the only very minor disappointment being the removal of the fresh oyster schucking station
3
We almost always go back to the Fullerton for our wedding anniversary dinner celebration but the buffet this year was disappointing.The conspicuous absence of oysters for a seafood buffet was really a disappointment for me.Overall the selection of food was average. And the BBQ section meats were a little too well done and left there for too lon
5
Buffet was great and variety was good. But lacked fresh oyster this time round. Chilli crab ran out real fast and the restaurant was really crowded.
5
This buffet is a really great way of experiencing all a range of different local Singapore dishes. It's a really replacing environment, reasonably priced and the staff are very good.
5
One of the best buffet breakfasts we have had. A huge selection of local and international dishes including Indian and Japanese. All staff very friendly and prompt service
3
We enjoyed the buffet though the dessert section was quite a let down. Mostly local kueh kueh. No more quality cakes like previously
3
The buffet spread was so so, desserts spread were also limited, only kueh kueh, no cakes etc... the texture of lobsters were bad as well. The standard has dropped
3
Some good stations such as fresh sashimi - chef replenishes food and utenils conscientiously and indian curryLocal meats were disappointing - boney, cold and poor standardFood handlers were not friendlyJapanese tenpura station prepared tempura till 9pm then stopped replenishing the buffet line though they continued cooking the expensive items (where did the 20-30 prawn tempura go? Chefs dinner?)Saved by service staff who are attentiveAt $70 per head without drinks I would recommend Jade restaurant instead or outside Fullerton Hotel altogethe
3
We went to the buffet at the Fullerton hotel with our tour groupWhat I liked1. Nice traditional decor2. Lots of seafood and really great sushi.3. Great variety of choices - Indian Chinese Malay.4. Very attentive and professional staff - answered all questions about allergies. They were also able to accommodate with additional vegetarian options. Excellent for a buffet!5. Went next door to a really cute bar (Post Bar) in the hotel for a Singapore sling. Fun night!What could be improved1. I would say this was a good quality buffet but there wasn't anything really impressive except the salmon sushi.Other1. Phoned hotel to confirm the dress code, since I hoped to wear jeans given we had a tour before dinner. Their only concern was flip flops. My guide also said no swim wear
5
My partner and I went for dinner with friends at Town Restaurant, The Fullerton Hotel. I suffer with a gluten allergy and when I saw we would be eating at a buffet, I was rather worried. However, the staff were absolutely incredible and went above & beyond!I was walked around the buffet and informed what I could eat and what I couldn't eat. The chefs said that they could also make me special gluten free food if required. They informed me that the desserts were not gluten free, but then they went above & beyond again when they came over and gave me a gluten free dessert selection that they had made especially for me to enjoy.All staff were magnificent, especially Damien and Jun Wei. I will definitely be going back to Singapore and I will definitely visit Town Restaurant at The Fullerton for dinner again
5
A really well-stocked buffet with interesting, multicultural meal options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Snag an outside table by the river if you can - it's a little quieter and very pleasant to sit by the water.The sushi bar is a particular highlight; if you're there for breakfast, don't miss the omelette station
5
If you are in business trip to Singapore, like to have to choice of spread. (people who are allergic to shell fish need to be careful, though counter has the local name printed in English you really don't know what it is). Easy to have quick breakfast and get going to financial district
4
Nice place with decent view of Singapore river. Staff are friendly and prompt to your requests. Place is well maintained and decent atmosphere.
4
Quality & good food with nice ambience & attentive staff. A very satisfying dinner with my family... solid!!
5
Superb Sunday buffet that would classify easily as a culinary event.The champagne option adds considerably to the price and there is juice and ice tea available as an alternative. The choice of food stations is impressive and makes this a special event option for most people.Setting is superb and the staff were friendly and helpful.Highly recommended
5
Tried Town at the Fullerton on our last evening in Singapore and truely wished we had found it earlier. We opted for the S$89 "Barbecue Buffet" which included either endless Singapore Slings or beer for two hours. The buffet was really too extensive to list but included a fresh seafood bar, Sushi, pasta, barbecued meats, noodles etc: The quality of the food and the service was of the first order and represented very good value for money; I would not hesitate in recommending this restaurant
3
Nice ambience, nice gesture to provide lobster Thermidor to every table. Food spread average, not wow. Culinary staff not impressive. At one point there was no one at service counter. Service staff, Herman is good. Looked after our group well. Last round of buffet, we were not told, I forgotten to have dessert! White Wine served was not chilled enough. Korean staff pleasant but does not know temp of chilled wine. Overall staff pleasant but not wow.Big thanks to Irene Tan (DOC) who recommended this venue. Tks for kind arrangement. Irene also promoted to us Mooncakes which sound attractive. V kind of Irene to speak with everyone of my guests.
4
Tried Saturday hi-tea, the variety was good and the staff was attentive. The staff told me there was 15% credit card discount but they have forgotten to extend the discount
5
Had a family lunch at town and was impressed at the excellent choice. Town is located in the beautiful Fullerton Hotel, ex Singapore CPO. On offer was Italian, local, Indian, Japanese, seafood and much more. The staff were excellent and in particular Ramil who was so friendly and attentive
5
When we were staying at The Fullerton, we went to this restaurant for the buffet breakfast. The selection of hot and cold items were far too many and the service was very good. Restaurant has charming views of the river and its great for an early morning treat. The buffet costs about 50 sgd per head
4
Great, central location and lovely environment - We did not have a reservation but were seated overlooking the canal. We ordered from the a la carte menu â€“ The Town laksa and the Fullerton burger were both delicious. A bit pricy compared with other restaurants we visited in Singapore but a very pleasant evening and worth it
3
Food quality was well below par, variety sucked, top up was slow, serving staff didn't like what they were doin
5
The breakfast buffet at the Town Restaurant had an excellent array of choices: local, Indian, Japanese and International. And what's better than having lots of choices, they tasted excellent.
5
Great local classics: rojak, Mee siam was delicious, kueh all fresh. Worth the trip just for the tea, buffet clotted cream and scones, in that order.
4
Good various of local food and a affordable price for hi-tea buffet. I had a very full lunch. Will come again. 👍
5
Exceptional service received from the staff. Food quality was good, BBQ selection has some room for improvement but the excellent customer service more than made up for the lack in selection.
5
Good food, good variety, comfortable atmosphere and dedicated service crew. Worth a visit definitely
1
First of all the food. Yes its a dinner buffet. There is unlimited free flow of lobster, BUT the flesh is too rough. Very dfficult to chew and there is too much water oh the shell once you remove the flesh. The Sashimi selection, i dont understand why the sashimi is cut into such a thick slice (1.5cm) thickness? Doesn't it defeat the purpose of the tast of the Sashimi? They serve Laksa? The gravy is tasteless not thick doesnt laste like laksa. The Chicken rice, it taste weird it taste like the chick is not fresh or it is not cooked proper. Drinks? Only service cofee and all kinds of teas however you need fruit juice or some other beverages you need to pay for it. Imagine paying so much for a 6 star hotel butfet and doesnt give you cold beverages??? The restaurant, concrete flooring no carpet and wooden table. It look like a 1 star restaurant inside a 6 star hotel. Wait a minute... I dont think it is even 1 star. .. Guess what the servers are not professional, can't even clear the table plates fast enough and expect customer to return the tray and not even show appreciation of thanks... When it comes to payment, I ask any credit card on promotion? They ask me what card i have and check with the cashier... I meam the restaurant manager should brief the staff what kind of promotion going on instead of asking the customer what card i have...??? Guest what UOB card got 20% discount and only apply to max no. of pax. In the first place isnt the staff should inform to the guest on the promotion details.
3
There were a lot of various of local food however, salad choice ingredients were lacking, there were no conditmenta for salad. Desserts were average
5
Great dining experience, it was warm and welcome by the staff. Buffet spread was great and yummy, plus the 30% off discount so worth it. The service was attentive, especially the manager Mr Irman. He was the best ever, thoughtful and details in so many things. We definitely will be back for him and the food for sure. Kudos to the team too
5
What a great time we had for the brunch on Father's Day. All of us loves the food and fun environment that we experience.Friendly service. Huge bear. Live music. Just make the place lively and enjoyable. Just keep going and keep it happening.Cheers

I have been to town restaurant many for the last few years. This remains my favorite for buffet... Their seafood and sashimi are just wonderful. The hotel is located in heart of raffle place and is quite affordable price compare to other buffet in Singapore. They have variety of local Chinese Indian vegetarian food to propose. There are 2 different prices one is adding meat bbq + free flow of soft drink/beer if I remember well. However I prefer the cheaper option as the BBQ meat has nothing exceptional. I would recommend you try the oyster/salmon sashimi for seafood. Chicken / roasted pork for meat. They used to have laksa but in my last visit it wasn't there and replaced with Vietnamese rolls. (not sure if that was temporary). There are also Indian food and Nans/prata. For desert they have many choices for you to try small cake to pudding / tiramisu.. The tiramisu and crème brûle are just a killer. I love this place and will come again. Also, after each visit they will give you a 30% voucher discount for your next visit. That's marvelous!!!
4
We were there for lunch buffet and the place was crowded but not chaotic like some other hotel buffets. This place offers great local food especially if you have guests in town.
3
We visited the restaurant on a Wednesday night which was supposedly to be a seafood theme night. However, the food variety does not justify the expensive price per pax given that it's spread was so limited and couldn't live up to the seafood theme. The seafood spread was just the usual sashimi (3 types: salmon, maguro and swordfish), cold chilled prawns, mussels, clams, scallopsand oysters. There were also complimentary cheese grilled lobsters. As for the dessert table, it looked "empty". However, the exceptional service from the staff saved the night as upon knowing it was my birthday, the restaurant gave us a complimentary birthday cake with personalized photo.
4
Home of the star tonight, we have the honour to meet Chef Chan Hon Meng with his signature soya sauce chicken rice dish, follow with other fresh seafood and also sushi, the dessert counter and overall presentation look good, able to hold big group and also the service is fantastic. Helpful, friendly and efficient service. The aroma of the coffee and the TWG tea selection serve at the finishing is a good way to chit chat and end the dinner. Recommend for big group, corporate events or couple
5
Spotted this place whilst admiring the beautiful Fullerton Hotel during a night time stroll along Singapore River and decided to head their for dinner the next night. Restaurant is buffet style with food from all around the world. The Pork Buns were the best I have ever eaten!!! The service from all the staff waiters & chefs was extremely friendly. Setting is beautiful right on the river. Would recommend to anyone. Thanks for a great night
5
Available: Japanese (generous cuts of sashimi, sushi ), seafood (Oyster, crab, Prawn, smoke salmon), Chinese (noodles, dim sum, crispy pork, roast duck, hainamese chicken) , small selections of Indian, lots of dessert (ice cream, fondue, 8+ cakes), Italian (2 pizza and a few pastas). Cost about S$75/pax inclusive of tax and service.
5
The hi-tea experiences at Town restaurant have always been splendid.I have been patronising the hi-tea session at the Town Restaurant for the past 5 years and have been bringing different groups of friends there for various celebrations, such as birthdays and festivities. Always book early to prevent disappointment. The local food fare is always maintained at very high quality and patronised by tourists and locals, the right illustration of what is Singapore local fare! Well done!
5
We had brunch at the Town on Mother's Day although we were in fact celebrating our daughter and her husbands first wedding aniversary. What a magnificent spread of food. Just about everything you could think of was available. All fresh and all lovely. Certainly the best choice of food I can remember. Staff were excellent and the champers was flowing. My thanks to everyone who made it a very special time
5
I went there for the buffet dinner, the first thing I was impressed by the decoration and the location of the restaurant. It's fantastic!!!! I was seated outside the restaurant where it was near the river, the first thinking in my mind was " outside? " but it was completely opposite of what I was thinking! It's totally amazing and comfortable, it's more beautiful at night! About the food, it's good and quite attractive to foreigners but for locals, it's completely disappointing. It's not so many varieties and diversities. It's also lack of staff for each area but the staffs were extremely attentive. For my recommendation, the restaurant should create more impressive dishes to attract more guests, mostly is locals. That night I and my family were served by a enthusiastic staff and his name was Azman. He served us with all of his best service and his enthusiast, his energy were made us satisfied. The hotel should appreciate of the value of this staff. Anyway, the food is quite ok for us and the service was perfect and the price was worth for the money we spent. The promotion for that Mother's Day was amazing and attractive!
5
2 weeks ago, me and my date ate here and we really enjoy the food plus the value for money is okay. We where assisted by Geraldine who welcomed us with a smile. I will surely recommend this place if you have occasions or even just a walk-in visitor because the foods, drinks, and place are simply awesome. I can consider one of the best place to fill in your stomach with good food. Thank you Town Restaurant for the memorable experience
3
The spread are mostly local food like laksa, mee siam, mee rebus, rojak, satay, nasi lemak and more. A small japanese section with limited sushi, soba, 2 appetisers and one deep fried seafood ball, no sashimi. For S$36/adult and S$18/child 6-11yo, it is reasonable. A few things to highlight though,(1) very slow with food replenishment. Chicken wing, desserts, rojak paste and peanuts were left empty for more than 15mins.(2) MSG in food, felt very thirsty after the mea
5
I liked the good variety of food served during breakfast. I stayed at the verandah, with a good view of the river and the people walking around the parks.
4
Good location and lovely view, except parking expensive and quite a distance not suitable for handicapped, too many sets of stairs. Lunch spread is moderate. Suitable for business lunch meeting. I prefer the dinner spread though.
5
It's been a long time since I've felt as pampered at a restaurant. Top-notch service, delicious treats brought to our table and even garlic naan made special for us (when staff noticed we were dipping our bread rolls into the yummy fish head curry!). High standards of service and an empowered staff really make a difference in a situation where there are buffet choices galore. We choose to return from time to time because of this consistency. Kudos to the team - and thanks Belle and Mahes for looking after us
5
Came with my friends for dinner and was impress with the warm greeting at the door (Almost everyone greets us with a smile) Having our dinner at the outdoor was great. Nice view of the river and our server was good as well. Always checking on us if we are good.When it gets slightly humid we requested to shift indoor and they got us a table fast and move us in. I shall say that all the staff is helpful and always put on a smile. To me it's a great choice to have our dinner at Town. But i need to mention our server Azman as he is nice and funny. We like him. Thank you Azman
5
Good spread of seafood, attractive membership discount of 30%, Lovely ambience and tasty international support, staff Mahes and Sophia offer personalised service. Lobster served during buffet
5
Was there with my fam on Mother's day. The staff were extremly friendly and helpful. We were there early and the chefs stood along the stairs to welcome us. The spread was fantastic. My fam was pleased with my choice and am glad it made my mother's day (pun intended)

I just held my dad's 70th birthday at The Town over the weekend and it was a fabulous event! Everybody loved it!First of all, great thanks to Khalid and his team of servers! They were all professional and so attentive even though the restaurant was running full. They cleared plates quickly and were so prompt with our requests that there's nothing I can fault.This was the Singapore Local Delights buffet and the food was so so good! There was so much variety until I didnt know where to start! I need to come back again to try the other items i missed! Also appreciated the fact that food items were replenished quickly and regularly! It was definitely value for money.The team at Town were also very kind to provide me with balloons and also a nice chocolate cake for my dad. Small gestures which I really appreciate and which really makes a nice touch to special gatherings. Everybody had a good time and I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart for making my dad's birthday really memorable!Last but not least, the greeters at The Town are truly warm and friendly! Keep it up! :

Town restaurant never fails to impress us with their services. We were there to celebrate our Father's Birthday. The food is fantastic and complimentary birthday cake was provided for us.
5
This hotel is my favourite. The staff are very attentive and helpful. Nothing seems to be too much trouble for themI have stayed here many time over the years and have never been disappointedThe food is well prepared and served. A great varietyIf you can keep staff like Belle Alexis you will always please your customersYour staff always present wel

My family and I visited Town Restaurant to experience the buffet lunch that included the many Singaporean classical dishes ranging from Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Indonesian food.It's a very popular place judging from the amount of people in the restaurant, and at times the flow of people could be a bit congested at some stations. Food was delicious and authentic; the wide variety was the draw card. I liked the desserts and fruits station which the display was beautiful and choices plentiful.Personally I preferred to come to the restaurant for breakfast which was quieter and more relaxing. I would recommend come down for breakfast early, sit outside, and enjoy the tranquility of the surrounding along the Singapore River. They had also a large variety of breakfast choices. It's an experience in itself.One suggestion is to upgrade the furniture and renovate to refresh the energy of the place, as I could see that some aspects look a bit tired.Overall it's an enjoyable place
4
Devotees of neo-classical architecture and ambience will love this restaurant for its fine dining experience. There's a choice of river frontage al fresco dining, or, as we did, inside air-conditioned comfort. Unfortunately we arrived too late for the lunch-time buffet, but were still treated to a nice a la carte meal with friendly fine-dining service. It was a most enjoyable interlude as we explored the city on a particularly hot day. If we ever get the chance to go back to Singapore, we most definitely want to have dinner there by the riverfront

We were here on a Saturday for its buffet lunch, supposedly to be High Tea buffet, from 12pm - 3.30pm. It has been quite a while since we last visited it and a great "revisit".The Town Restaurant is located on the first floor of Fullerton Hotel. The ambience of the restaurant is nice and cosy, smoothing, bright and wonderful. We were ushered to our sofa seats shortly after we were greeted and attended by a staff to the main dinning hall via a flight of stairs. Well, it's typically a local Singaporean restaurant featuring lots of local stuff, such as the Orchid flowers and many pictures of the popular local dishes.As the theme is Singaporean Food/Local Delights, sure enough, it offered lots of local popular dishes (a great number from the street food) and in fact, all, if not most, local food could be found "under this roof"!Right in the center of the restaurant was the "main" section comprising food like Nasi Lemak (coconut rice) with lots of condiments, side dishes to go with it, like fried chicken wings (good), fried egg, otah (marinated bbq fish wrapped in banana/bamboo leaves)(good), ikan bilis and peanuts (quite salty); fried bee hoon, laksa (prepared by chef based on your choice of ingredients)(quite nice, not overly thick with the coconut milk), fried rice, soon kueh and chwee kueh (average), goh-hiong (too dry), deep fried spring rolls (ok), curry puffs (nice), various meat of satay (some were overly grilled while some under grilled), and tom yam soup (good but with no ingredients inside, just soup but not warm enough) etc.There was also a section of sandwiches, bread and cakes, mini burgers. Generally, they were quite nice.On the left section was mainly Indian dishes like prata with curry chicken or fish, nann etc; on the right section was the Japanese items like sushi (quite a wide spread), udon, some deep fried item like the seafood ball, ice cream etc. But there was no sashimi.Walking forward was the section of local cakes and pastries like several kinds of nonya kuehs and malay pastries. Generally, they were very nice and yummy. On the right was the dessert section with ice kacang, tau suan and the must try egg tarts!!! The egg tarts were indeed very good and yummy!Walking up the flight of stairs towards the main entrance, it was the salad, rojak (local styled salad), fruits and drink section. Several kinds of salad were offered, drinks including the grass jelly, iced milo and many kinds of cut fruits like water melon, pineapple, oranges, plum, jackfruit, honeydew etc.On its side was another live cooking section for the Malay noodles, mee siam and mee rebus! Actually the mee siam was quite yummy and good! At the side corner of the main entrance was the Popiah and Kueh Pie Tee.We would agree that spread of the buffet was quite extensive and covered about 80% of the most popular local food were offered in this buffet spread (which was good) and most of them were actually nice and tasty. For area of improvement, it will be good to also include the famous Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodles (or Prawn Noodles), Char Kueh Teow and Fried Carrot Cake (or Fried Omelette). Well, if got the Hainanese Chicken Rice, it would be perfect and heavenly (they can remove 2-3 other less known dishes).Coffee and Tea were also included in the buffet and they would be served to you by the staff unlike some other restaurants with the Coffee Machines. Coffee was passable (actually quite tasteless and dilute), while the green tea was good.Well, may have left out some items (either we didn't try at all, have forgotten for there were some many food offered or those not worth mentioning) but felt that have covered at least 75-80% in total.Service was great. Generally, staff were polite and cheerful as they always carry a smile and our used plates and utensils were regularly cleared promptly without the need to request them in doing so. Our iced water was also refilled promptly. And the supervisor in charge also dropby at every table to ask diners about their dinning experiences and solicit feedback.Our dinning experience was great and we enjoyed very much of our meal here. Although there were some "misses", generally it had many more "hits" in terms of the spread, variety and tastiness of the food offered.We would rate it 4.5 star (its very rare that we rated an establishment of this grade here in Singapore or in our walk around the world, from Asia to Australasia, Europe, US or Canada). But since we are not able to give a 0.5 star, we decided to award it a 4-star rating here (instead of 5) so as to provide room for further improvement.But we will surely revisit this place again very soon, with our family members or friends

I've been to fullerton hotel for a wedding and wanted to try town restaurant. For a easter long weekend, but perhaps they were under staffed(I dont know), variety was lacking and food was average, you are only paying for the ambience. I dont think my group of friends will visit a seond time
5
The food was delicious and plenty. The staff were amazing always smiling and very helpful. We did the buffet, loved it. Would dine here again
5
I love the food! But the service was awesome that i definitely will be back. Thanks to Irman and Junwei for always serving us with energy. I cannot help noticing that Irman always going around to check on his guest and often seen smiling and laughing with the guest.Thanks for the memorable experience. Will be back soon! I hope we can have the chance to see Irman and Junwei too

This buffet is by no means a cheap buffet. Was absolutely dismayed at the food presented to us. My family and I came here primarily for the baked cheese lobster which is part of the buffet. The lobster has to be ordered from the staff and is served to you instead of being freely available at the counters. The lobster served was disappointing; it comprised of an empty shell that was partially filled with diced lobster meat poured over with melted cheese. The amount of meat in each shell is probably â…“ what you would expect if they served you a fresh lobster. The buffet had an hourly serving of a dish that was prepared on the spot by a chef. Quantity of the dish is limited and can only serve about 20-30 small servings which resulted in many diners being disappointed after queuing up for the dish. I would not recommend this place to anyone
5
Great place for our small family wedding reception. The buffet food was excellent, freshly prepared. The staff were very helpful and attentive. We were allowed to bring along some decorations and a nice corner allocated for us. Special thanks to Kate for helping with the booking and other arrangements. Not forgetting Geraldine, Cherry and Ashirin
5
Very good Service. Always serve with a smile. Good variety of food. An ideal dining place for friends gathering
5
A buffet was a lovely spread of food that was both well prepared and very nicely displayed. My wife had the buffet and I ordered a Wagyu burger that was topped with Foie Gras.... Wow it was exceptional. The burger was the fruition of a burger lovers dream the meat was great and the compliment of the Foie Gras was wonderful.Not the cheapest but this was Singapore and there are no visible bargains but the food was well worth the expense.The service was impeccable.
4
Went for their seafood dinner on a Wed night. Made use of the 1 for 1 HSBC promo and it is really great value. The grilled lobsters are tasty. Sashimi and roasted beef are also very good. Service is fast n friendly and the place is comfortable. Really enjoyed dinner
4
Had a family dinner here to celebrate my daughter's birthday. The buffet has limited variety but of a better quality compared to other hotels. Located in the CBD and next to the Singapore to river.
5
The buffets are unbelievable. There is no way you can even taste everything. My recommendation is: Go there hungry, but TAKE your time and taste small plates in a leisurly pace.
5
If you need to dine within the hotel, this is one restaurant you won't complaint. There is both indoor (aircon) and outdoor (alfresco with beautiful Singapore feel), and should seating capacity becomes a problem, they will offer you the lobby cafe area...which is a slight walk into the restaurant (not recommended for ladies in heels and family with young children). The food was always non-compromising, fantastic variety to choose from, authentic Peranakan cuisine (also known as Nyonya Cuisine - very Singapore heritage) and top notch service quality. There is standard buffet (considerably big spread) and also additional charges should you like include unlimited BBQ seafood + champagne. On one occasion, I took Vietnamese friends over (vietnam are well-known with fresh seafood) and they simply love it.
2
was staying in hotel and because of jet lag decided to have dinner in Hotel! from outside buffet seemed quite ok with seafood exhibition by the entrance.Seated outside in kind of small terrace and that was the nicest thing in dinner! Buffert food was completely not tasty and crab not fresh ! even deserts were kind of tasteless! tried several dishes from sea food, to noodles, duck or dumplings and in general evthg was bad! Biggest surprise was because breakfast buffet in same restaurant is quite good
4
Went here for a business meeting breakfast, but you can certainly come here for an breakfast occasion; maybe lunch and dinner too. The wow factor is sitting outside on the river should you be with your significant others or friends, but for a business meeting cum breakfast, I suggest you stay inside with the aircon. Plenty to choose from in terms of Western and Asian cuisine, so you're likely to satisfy your cravings. Beware of the language barriers of some of the staff as they went 0 for 4 on our coffee's, but quickly made it right once they understood us. Food and service was good on our visit and has been so in my previous visits
5
Celebrated my parents golden anniversary and my birthday there yesterday. I must commend Alson and his team for the absolutely fabulous service and food. They made our event a truly unforgettable one. We will definitely go back for the good food and impeccable service again. 
3
Had a buffet dinner under the theme of Heritage buffet with International selection. They have a good selection of main course. As they are holding a Young Hawker series currently, there is kueh pie tee and Popiah by a third generation hawker from Kway Guan Huat Joo Chiat Original Popiah & Kueh Pie Tee. It is a nice touch to have a professional make it for you. The oyster selection is disappointing as it lacks the sweetness. The sashimi has the usual salmon, tuna and swordfish. It has a generous portion and was tasty! The local selection of roast meat has nothing to shout about. If you are a dessert lover, you could be disappointed by the small selection of noya kueh and cakes. We had a much better experience at Clifford Pier but was at a higher price.
5
A good spread for breakfast and good varieties of Asian and western food as well. Attentive staff to cater to every needs.
5
It was an impromptu visit on 11 March 2017 evening and was very impressed by the service especially the manager - Jaideep (do hope that I got his name right). I had a last minute request to surprise my friend with a slice of birthday cake from Cake Boutique. Not only did he attend to it personally, the cake was even on the house. He took our group photo and even presented the birthday girl with our group photo together with a birthday card! It really made our day and was very thankful for the extra efforts taken. The food selection was good and they served very fresh sashimi. We will definitely be back!
4
Good service, lovely staff and nice ambience. Looks and feels a little like fine dining but the price is affordable. The food was awesome. Everything we tried was great. Will definitely come back again to try more dishes
5
Thumbs up for amazing service! Very proud of the service team and kitchen. Everyone is second to none!
5
The buffet was great but a little bit short of variety of food. Great variety choices of dessert though.
4
We went as a family to the Sunday brunch. The restaurant is nice with an outside terrace. We were indoors but by the window. Champagne was offered as soon as we sat down and continued to be topped up very regularly. It was nice friendly service and entertainment of the two post office large costumed bears were great for our 22 months old grandson. There is also a live trio which plays popular music during the afternoon. The food is OK. Not the best of the Sunday brunches available in Singapore but certainly enough choice of fresh fish, grilled meat, salads and desserts. The Fullerton is of course a historical building and the small historical display is a must for the first time visitor
3
The spread was a lot but the quality of the food was not up to standard. The oyster looked so cheap and in fact too tiny. Services are bad and tough to get any attention from the staff. Taste of the food really average.
2
We came here to sit outside, have a late night drink and my husband a cigar. While initially, all was well - a nice spot outside, drinks promptly taken care of...it was going fairly well. Until my husband ordered a cigar. The staff couldn't find a cigar menu. We waited. And asked again. Still, the longest wait until the menu arrived. Then we had to wave someone down for the order. Then the longest wait again - only to have a cigar arrive with an ashtray...no lighter or cigar cutter. Asked for that. Again the longest of all the waiting time we had...it spoiled what we thought would be a lovely end to our evening (dinner elsewhere). The lack of attention really killed our experience here. Maybe you have to stay here to get the right service
4
Town was the restaurant we enjoyed our breakfast daily(x3). Their service, setting, and display (of foods) were excellent. Each day they made a minor change in their presentation of the foods. This exhibited they were serious in pleasing their guests, particularly the ones long-stayed in their hotel. For guests had to pay for the breakfast, it would cost $32. Certainly it would be good to include it as part of hotel charge ($325 per night). The foods presented included Chinese, Japanese, Singaporean and American. Marvelous
4
Variety of food and beverages are limited. Staff are polite. Atmosphere is acceptable. Hope to see an improvement in food and beverages during my next visit
4
We went for supper on the terrace, which at dusk gives a view of Boat Quay as the sun goes down, then the effect of the lights coming on and boats on the river is spectacular.Food is very good, and service is excellent. It's sometimes disconcerting to have passers by staring at you as you are eating, but if this puts you off, you can eat in the restaurant
4
We were chucked at the corner of the restaurant near the television, apart from having to squeeze into our seats, the a/c wasn't working
4
Deciding to spoil ourselves we made an (easy) online booking for our recent trip up to Singapore. The Sunday lunch buffet and free flowing champagne was very nice. Busy and a bit noisy but service and access to food stations was good. Usual buffet fare that you would expect - and all high quality. Seafood, roast, local food, including Indian, spaghetti station, fantastic desserts. You can sit outside, overlooking the river. Live entertainment. Not cheap but would recommend for a special occasion
3
Decent food - I had fish and chips and my wife had sea bass
Shared a salad as a starter
Decent food if not exciting but nice view of river from the terrace and friendly service
5
This location and surroundings are very classy; maybe the food was not superior to other buffets but the staff were very classy and gave excellent service.There was enough choice on the buffet to satisfy all tastes.
3
Have to take the Bbq option with free flow beverages as variety is limited. Bbq prawn was the best item. Desserts is very limited. View of the river is fantastic
3
The laksa was good and others seemed to be having the buffet. Service was a little on the slow side. Quite expensive for what we had. $50 each for a laksa and mint tea
5
The food was great!!! and also the service. Thank you Irman. Irman was a great host. Wonderful experience at Town Restaurant. Very nice staff
5
Sat outside the alfresco, staff kept checking if everything was okay. If the food was okay. Was my friends birthday and they printed a birthday photo for us! Enjoyed our time for sure
5
The food variety and quality was excellent, and the service was faultless! I would highly recommend this place to everyone
5
This is my first time in this hotel as well as dining in town restaurant .Set up ,food and atmosphere was great n especially the staffs like mr mannam who was extremely friendly n informative .we had burger ,soup ,laksa,Hokkien mee n satay .Just a note -to my own personal opinion the satay was slightly overpriced .portion can be bigger .Thank you for the wonderful experience .we will be back Cecelia lee
5
2nd time having dinner at town. Good food and great service. In particular, our waiter Mannan was very friendly, attentive and helpful. 10/10 would go again.
5
We had such a lovely time at Town restaurant tonight for my mother's birthday. We had a party of 4 and were very well taken care of by our server Mannan. In fact, in most seafood buffets there will be quite a fair bit of competition trying to get the lobsters. But Mannan had taken the liberty to serve us bbq lobsters twice, without us having to say anything at all! It really is quality service with quality food. He checked on us regularly and was really spot on with the timing of getting the complimentary cake for my mother. They even took a picture of us and printed it on a lovely card:) All in all, good value for a free flow of beer and singapore sling with top notch oysters and fantastic ambience. We would def recommend it to anyone who wants to try
5
Town was great! The food was fresh and there was a good selection. Our waiter, Mannan, was the highlight. He was friendly and made us feel right at home. Service was impeccable. Thanks Mannan!
5
This is the favorite buffet dinner place for me and my friends where we will organize our gatherings at every now and then.They served our favorite Fresh Oysters, Tiger Prawns, Swordfish Sashimi and Crème Brulee! Service was always good and very attentive service staffs
5
We had breakfast and dinner at Town restaurant and I must say that this is an excellent location, the staff is very nice, it has many food options and the food is excellent, too. I highly recommend "Town Restaurant
5
Have always enjoyed dinning in this beautiful classy colonial heritage hotel, located in Singapore's downtown Raffles Place area.I love walking through their revolving door and voluminous lobby area (with atrium) which boasts of fine floral arrangements, to get to Town Restaurant.This is a gorgeous restaurant ambience, to be enjoyed with clients, colleagues or family alike.Their spread of buffet includes Japanese, local and some Western offerings. They also offer Indian cuisine, which is tasty and their papadum is addictive. They have a good cheese selection.They also offer fresh seafood like various types of oysters, prawns, and sashimi. Their local cuisine like Laksa is delicious.Dessert was in the form of myriad western cakes and pudding, as well as asian style desserts such as nonya kueh. They also have the ubiquitous ice cream bar, chocolate fountain with strawberries and marshmallow for dipping. One can also make our own local dessert - ice kachang.When we visited, there was an excellent promotional buffet lunch price at $39++ only.Service is impeccable, befitting of a splendid five-star luxury hotel.Call or check their website for any prevailing buffet lunch or dinner promotion. They usually offer some credit card discounts.HelenSingapor
5
We came here for a light lunch – went to the wrong area initially but were personally taken to our table in the Town – another lady appeared with menus – and the experience began – comfortable table within the atrium – draft tigers – cub and adult – food next – grilled vegetable sandwich with salad and fries – hot to the table – well seasoned – very tasty – job done So well done we came back in the evening – ate dinner outside – me the chicken curry – my partner the Char Koay Teow – tasty hot spicy – well priced - a great view of the river - thank yo
5
Totally my favorite buffet lunch. Veuve Cliquot free flowing the entire time. Fantastic service from Mannan. Wish we had this level of service in Australia.
5
My third trip to The Town restaurant for the Sunday buffet and it did not disappoint. The food and wine selection was outstanding and our waiter Mannan was fantastic. Highly recommend!
4
Delicious food and awesome spread they have . Recommend to have their Singapore sling .  But it's bit pricey , but buffet is value for money 
5
Our family visited this restaurant for an early Christmas lunch on December 23rd. The buffet had an excellent selection of international and local food. The service was some of the best I have ever experienced for a very busy buffet at this time of the year. Service was provided by Poobalan & Karen and we were highly impressed with everything about this hotel. Also the restaurant has a very nice outdoor area looking on to the river. Highly recommende
5
This outdoor and indoor restaurant is located in Fullerton old Brutish style superb hotel.If You sit outside views are wonderful-river,illuminated bridges and ships passing by.We came for dinner there which is buffet type.We were not disapointed at all..Serving man was speaking English ,German and Italian as we heard and his seance of humor was outstanding.Meals choice in the buffet overcame all expectations.When we started with crab .continued with oysters from New Zealand, the Pekineses goose, and creme brule.t is not cheap restaurant .but it is better to spend more than eat in street dining rooms serving awesome food , 
4
We always seem to migrate here as such a great view and good setup. The food is awesome and has a good mid week selection. Weekends buffet is the gut buster but we were not in S'pore during this time.
4
You are able to find the favorite local delights here at this nice restaurant with nice ambience. The staffs were attentive and friendly. Food quality was acceptable and the varieties were great. Love the idea of having this high tea during lunch time!
5
I visited this buffet on a Wednesday night for dinner with my partner and we had the seafood and BBQ buffet with unlimited singapore slings/beer and lobster for 2 hours. There was a massive selection of food with oysters, prawns, scallops, sashimi, pasta, stir fried vegetables, curries, roast meats, cheese and desserts. It is a great experience and nice atmosphere. The food is of a relatively high standard. It was a special night out
1
We were at the place for 12 when the buffet opened - food was already cold.We booked for NYE as a special treat - quite frankly street hawker food is far superior.Limited selection of Asian food - luke warm at best. Sorbet the only desert.Incredibly disappointing and not worth the money
4
Buffet range is wide n has good spread of seafood and dessets. Would recommend restaurant. Service staff is excellen
3
This is my first Buffett dinner after returning from great food overseasFor the same amount I could have enjoyed a one star Michelin kaiseki dinner. For foreigners, the variety of local dishes might seem exciting but quality was very average. Best left to hotel guests
4
It's more than what I expected especially Asian style. Overall, the food is delicious and value for money when compared to other hotels
5
This is our fourth visit to Town and our first Christmas Day visit. They didn't let us down! We were greeted by our lovely server, Mannan who was friendly, attentive and kept our bubbly glasses well topped up all night. The food was plentiful +++ with all the usual delights (shellfish, sashimi, pizzas, pastas, currys, dim sum, salads, fresh breads, cheeses,) plus all the Christmas dinner favourites! Lamb, turkey, beef and gammon were all cooked beautifully. The ambience was fun without being stuffy, the food (and bubbly) was great and the staff (especially Mannan!) went out of their way to make sure we all had a wonderful Christmas and left suitably stuffed! We'll be back!
5
Mannan was our server for a Sunday brunch and he was absolutely PHENOMENAL! Such great attention and such great care for detail. He was really concerned with us having a great time and really getting our money's worth. Overall great experience.
3
Limited choices of food. Food was warm but not hot. Try their ice kachang, totally bland like eating plain ice. Not worth the price.
4
Celebrated birthday at the restaurant. Excellent service overall & wide variety of food. Thanks to Mannan and team who has prepared a surprise birthday cake for us and made this a memorable evening by being so attentive throughout the dinner=
5
This was our second visit as we were impressed when we went for the first time during Chinese New Year this year. The staff provided excellent service, frequently walking around to clear the table, refill our drinks. There was also a wide selection of food from Japanese to local delights. The Kueh dadar was my favorite, fragrant shredded coconut yet not overly sweet
4
decided to celebrate my son birthday at the restaurant after recommended by one of the regular.though the food spread was extensive but most were carbo and nothing unique but the service indeed was excellent.thanks Peter and his team for providing a memorable experience on this special day.we were very happy.overall good food and affordable price with excellent service
4
The spread was limited compared to other buffets considering the price point of S$70++. The desserts were also limited. A little bit of variety would have been nice- all they had were cakes. A couple of seafood items were good. The soup and pasta was also nice. The outside view on riverside is nice for a calm evening. Service was very good
1
Town wasn't our first choice for he evening but we had high expectations given its location and format.It failed to deliver on almost every aspect of the experience. Upon being seated we were told we could have a choice of meat or seafood buffet. We then browsed to see very little meat on offer, it turned out you had to order it to the table but this was not explained at all. We were then presented with a plate of freezing cold cooked lobster, not having any idea if this was part of the seafood buffet or just part of the meal. We then asked what the vegetarian options were and he answer given by our waitress was "nothing".She did eventually bring some of the meat options to our table but by this time we had no interest in eating them.The local choice in the buffet and not of high quality, barring some of he seafood and sushi. We had two bottles of wine so these can be discounted from the ridiculous total of $1600 SGD for 6 people, but this is the worst value for money I have found in Singapore on server all trips. We could have fed 6 in a Michelin star restaurant for less than the price paid at Town
5
I had a wonderful birthday dinner at the restaurant. It was a buffet dinner and we were served by Mannan. The food was excellent - I enjoyed the oysters, fresh prawns and the sashimi. And Mannan was very helpful and friendly. He brought us lobsters and also prepared a surprise birthday cake for the occasion! A delightful way to celebrate one's birthday
3
At S$69++/£39++/USD48++), the dinner buffet at the Town Restaurant was a let-down. At the time of booking, we were promised lobsters but we discovered that they were all cooked in only one style – with cheese – and there was hardly any lobster meat. Even the chicken rice, a local favourite, was rather tasteless. Several items were also simply different renditions of crab dishes. (There was no promotion to warn us in advance that it would be "crab night".) It got rather monotonous, and some of us are actually allergic to crabs!The desserts were also not very exciting. We also couldn't believe our eyes that a counter of freshly squeezed fruit juices was charging an additional S$10/- per glass bottle. This is not a common practice in international hotels around the world. Everything is usually already factored into the price per person. The only thing that wowed us was the fresh sashimi. I shouldn't have wasted my time on the other dishes. Seriously. If you have to eat here, have the breakfast buffet, which is much more decent and worthwhile. It's often included in the hotel package anyway.
4
I have been for the Sunday brunch twice now, once with my girlfriend, and second with family visiting from Perth, Australia. Great food and free flow Veuve. More importantly the friendly staff, especially for me, a guy called Mannan and a girl called Linda, so attentive and caring for our drinking needs and more. Also they have a band which is brilliant, playing the old classics and modern stuff. All in all I will be back for sure. Great experience and I'm very sure everyone else visiting will experience the same
5
The best brunch ever! Well worth it - amazing food only surpassed by the staff, Mannan especially. Would highly recommend! A must do in Singapore.
5
The birthday dinner was amazing. Great atmosphere, the deco was extravagant. And of course the service was wonderful. Our waiter Mannan was very understanding regarding our dietary requirements. He catered food accordingly with a starter soup, main meal, sides and desserts. We were fully satisfied with his friendly service and delicious meal!
5
The lunch buffet was fantastic – a wide array of delicious choices, and at the special price of $39++ per head. Only the pasta was disappointing: I ordered a spaghetti aglio olio but it was too dry and came with no ingredients. The service was impeccable – the wait staff were attentive and prompt without being intrusive
5
The food is great and diverse. The decor is extravagant. But it's the service that really makes the experience even better. Super friendly and attentive. If you get the chance when you're in town, you should definitely go
5
We had a buffet dinner for 2 here, arranged by a third party, to celebrate my mother's birthday. On arrival, we were greeted by the hostess and manager who showed us to our seats. On the way, the manager politely explained to us the food stations available. The quality here is what you would expect from a 5-star hotel restaurant- not exceptional, but above average. Our water was topped up constantly and our plates cleared consistently throughout dinner. Just when we were about to leave, a staff member stopped us to say they had a cake for us! We know this was arranged by the third party but was surprised that the frontline staff was also briefed on this and they remembered! On top of that, they took a picture of us and printed out the photo for us to take home. Faultless service from start to finish. All staff should be commended!
5
Buffet spread was excellent. Service was exemplary, especially supervisor Mannan. He was attentive to our needs throughout dinner and even served us yummy lobster and oysters! The mix of tobasco and lemon on the oysters converted even me who used to detest oysters! Service staff Jia Hui was another pleasant experience at the Town restaurant. She always had a smile for everyone.
5
Definitely we enjoyed large variety of cuisine! But I must say, they offered an outstanding customer service experience. A shout-out for Mannan for helping my birthday celebration extra special and we felt well pampered as he was very attentive and always greeted us with warm smile. He took the extra mile by singing with us a birthday song and offered us taking our photo which was well appreciated as a fantastic memory of our visit. Rachel was also very helpful and cheerful that attends to our attention. Overall, I can say our experience was pretty awesome, speedy attention and personality/helpfulness of the whole crew of Town Restaurant was one of a kind. Keep it up guys! We thank you for the fantastic experience
5
Decided to bring my wife for her birthday and Mannan and Rachel were very helpful to us! Absolutely amazing service! Additionally, the food was fantastic! Definitely will go back here again. Thanks again to Mannan and Rachel for the excellent service you have given us. Keep up the good work :
5
Buffet offered a good selection from appetizer, main and dessert. Mannan also was very helpful and looked into our concerns
5
Excellent service by Mannan and the rest of the staff! Will definitely recommend to friends and family
5
food is really good and their service is exemplary especially the supervisor mannan. we enjoyed our dinner and experience the local indian cuisine
5
Spent my birthday in Fullerton's Town Restaurant and enjoyed the Bbq buffet. Food is great with a vast selection and choices. Service of the staff is highly commendable especially Mannan, the supervisor. The other staff has also been leaning on him for some our requests, and were attended to. Will definitely come back
4
We went for breakfast at this restaurant. The spread of food was plentiful. It had the international spread as well as local delights. It's better to book a room with breakfast. Cos breakfast alone is $105 for two.
2
Visited the restaurant for my bday.The servers service is good. Food is below expectation. The lobster is not fresh. The most annoying part is a staff who unpolitely told us off & pushed away my mum when we wanted to take a photo for my mum with the bear at the lower level.We do not have his name but this is really unacceptable. He was v fierce and said the deco is not ready yet. This totally spoilt our mood that day
4
Good selection of cuisine. I especially like the sashimi and the roast meats sections. The cooked food section can be enhanced, I feel. I tried the steamed sea-bass the other day and I find it rather fishy
5
Food was good with a special kebab from the Chef from India. Whenever they ring the bell go for the special - worth the try. What we tried is delicious . Mr Mannan gave us excellent service. They also do a good Pasta too. Add a mango lassi fir a complete meal.Debora
5
There is a steep competition among the top hotels when it comes to the best Sunday Brunch buffet. Town Restaurant in Singapore's iconic Fullerton hotel is a clear winner. Today I was shown by the japanese section chef how they grate the wasabi with the sharkskin grater, the raw bar souschef gave us a lesson on hassle-free shucking of oysters. It is this level of personal attention and comittment you will get from every member of the staff. And then of course the range and quality of foods is simply amazing. Raw bar, sushi & sashimi, classic French and Italian specialties (e.g. risotto served in a hollowed-out parmiggiano cheese) and a Chinese section. Being a cheese lover, I was impressed by the assortment of French cheeses, all regions, all varieties of milk and some rare and delicious stinkers.Make sure you are hosted by Mannan, he is so attentive, especially when it comes to ensuring your glass of champagne remains full.Definitely a venue to come back to
5
The overall ambiance is soft, serene and nothing loud yet very inviting. The food was great in taste, range and variety. The service provided was nothing short of Excellent, which speaks highly of the team run by Mr. Michael Lee and his staff
4
This Sunday Brunch is well worth the money (around 105 € for adults with free flow Champagner and 36 € for Kids, while below 6 yrs of age is free).The atmosphere is great, ample food (huge variety of Seafood, european, Indian and other asian dishes) a good variety of Beef, Pork, Lamb, cheers selection etc. too much to mention.Large selection of pastries and freshly squeezed fruit juices. Entertainment provided by a band playing really well.Kid's have their own large room in the basement with several staff attending to the kids with different activities.The service personnel is really very friendly and outgoing to serve you well and try and make you feel good. Congrats to the Management!This is a worthwhile visit with family or friends to spend a couple of nice hours with excellent food and drinks for a reasonable amount of money.Easy reachable by Metro (Raffles Place Station) and a short walkVery recommendable
5
Our waiter Mannann - provided fantastic throughout our dinner and made it a memorable night. Will come bac

Visited the restaurant the second time last Saturday, the first was during CNY. I remembered the food to be good during CNY, loved the claypot with assorted seafood they served then. The visit this time was rather disappointing, considering the steep price we paid. The sashimi was disappointing, although the fish were sliced in huge slices, it was not sliced well (don't know a more proper word to describe it) and I ended up eating only a few slices. The prawns were fresh though, didn't try the oysters. There was a counter to get spaghetti, and I tried the carbonara and felt it was not flavoured well enough, and only had mushrooms in them. I like it that they served free flow crayfish and it was served chunkwise with a mushroom based sauce. A pity they were abit lukewarm when they were served to the table. Then there were the other main staples like the carving station, hainanese chicken rice, laksa, indian cuisine and desserts but nothing out of the ordinary. The refill of certain dishes were slow. The dessert table was disappointing, although I do like some of the breads. You can request for complimentary parking though.Will probably not go back anytime soon

Appalling is the only word to describe this... and in one of the best hotels. The buffet is very poor, luke warm food and few choices. The curry dishes for example provide tandoori chicken and a range of mushy veg dishes... Watch the chicken I picked out raw and uncooked pieces... all mixed with the cooked pieces. Gave up with unappetising food and went home. You'll pay $69 for the basic and $89 with the BBQ added... honestly neither are even close to being worth it. Try the Straits Kitchen at the Hyatt... what a difference..

Buffet grill and various other food: huge choice and variety. Very tasty. Will definetely be back for more. To be recommended.
4
Lunch buffet has everything you could want from sashimi to roast duck. Very impressive selection and quality. Only negative is the high cost, even for Singapore, otherwise would have been rated excellent
5
What to say, this is my 2nd time there. Like the place very much. Food is fantastic , service people there are very friendly and good
4
This restaurant serves breakfast runs for guests staying in the hotel. The variety for breakfast is great, however there are no changes to the menu. The restaurant also serves up local fare, breakfasts that the 4 races of Singaporeans would eat everyday. I find this a very good way to introduce visitors what do singaporeans eat. The service is superb and well organised
5
Second time visit. Mannan and Hui Ping served us very well. Great experience and Nice food. Will return next time
5
My wife and I go back every year to celebrate our wedding anniversary in the hotel we got married in.The staff are attentive, fantastically friendly and never fail with the small gestures to make the occasion a memorable one each year.The place is also very welcoming and friendly to the kids, making them feel perfectly at home
4
I've been there on my bday. I especially the ambience of the town restaurant. The team prepared for me small cake and card, which was quite nice. The service was exceptionally good. The day when I visited was "Vietnamese Day", which was also good
4
Just had a late dinner - a la crate as opposed to the buffet - after flying in. Staff were great, very cheerful and attentive despite the hour - special thanks to Mannan. Food was pretty good as well. The wine is a little lumpy but that didn't come as a surprise. Great table looking out at the clock tower and Victoria Theatre on the other side of the river
2
Went there Sept. 28 to treat my friend for her birthday. Salad bar appeared to be good, however, when they ran out of the roast duck salad, they did not replenish with the same salad, same thing happened with the avocado and shrimp salad. Chef/ staff at Japanese counter rude and sharp. No clue what was what and was reprimanded for taking someyhing that was not part of the buffet.There was a trainee cutting red chillie peppers at the main course buffet line who was rude and grumpy.The head waiter or manager was great but he only appeared towards the end of our time there
4
Funky restaurant with service of the highest quality. Food is also incredibly delicious and the ambience, fantastic.A great place to be on a date or with friends and loved ones. Eat eat eat
3
Buffet spread was pretty ok with oysters as part of the seafood course. Dessert spread was disappointing as the variety of cakes were little and not that fantastic. A few of us had diarrhea several times after our lunch buffet...most probably due to the unfreshed oysters we consumed
4
I have been to Town restaurant several times and I think it has lived up to its standard. Food wise so far so good especially the lobsters. Service was always good except for this time round maybe due to the crowd, the staffs were slightly slow in their service. Overall, it's a nice experience
1
The hotel caters to visitors from the Mainland who do not know how behave in a 5 star property and each visit to this restaurant was less enjoyable than before... Finally returned to Club Lounge where it was much nicer
5
The food was definitely much better than we remembered the last time we visited. Good selections of food to choose from! The service was even more spectacular! Making our dinner experience and my birthday more special :) A much deserve shoutout to our personal server Mannan, for an amazing service! Personally, the food and the ambience was surely great, but the service made it even more marvellous! Thanks Mannan :)) we will definitely come back! 5 stars!
5
I went with my friends (from USA)to celebrate her birthday and we were so impressed with service, foods and atmosphere over all. The manager made it extra special with a BD cake and photo etc. it was superb. When i m in Singapore again I will definitely visit.
4
I was there to celebrate a friend's birthday. The atmosphere is great and the staff is excellent! You can request for a special birthday cake and helped us sang the birthday song and took some photo. They also give a souvenir which is a card with a group photo. The food is not such a variety as I expected. However, they serve authentic Singaporean food and their Laksa is awesome
5
Such a great and sumptous food provided. I love seafoods and the rest of the viant..We really appreciate how the crew assisted us with their big smile and always paying attention to our needs. The highlights of giving the surprise cake to my hubby with the help of Mr. Jack and Mr Mannan was so awesome!. Keep up the good work, bcoz it feels so accommodating for every guest who visited this restaurant. Thank you!
2
After hearing so many good reviews about Town I decided to give it a try but I was sorely disappointed by the variety, quality of food and also the service staff who were rude/never around.
5
Good place to start your dinner. Nice food and variety. Staff is attentive to our request and diligently clearing our plate. Good offer . Will return for more
4
Good experience. Excellent Service. Staff are polite and sensitive to customers needs. Will definitely visit again
4
First time to eat in this buffet resto. Good variety, good staff. We were served by Mannan, who was very attentive.
Didn't get to try all dishes, but quick faves were the scallops, dimsum, and mango pudding. Lobster was unlimited but not remarkable.
4
The international buffet me and my friends always visits, as they served my favorite Oyster, Crème Brule and Swordfish sashimi. Their tiramisu was good too! Staff were super efficient and attentive.
4
Good location on ground floor and excellent breakfast buffet. Lots of choice and global cuisine with hot and cold dishes.
5
What a great way to celebrate National Day! A wide selection of the best hawker food from across the island, now conveniently in one location. I had a lovely window seat with a stunning sunset view. Kudos to our ever attentive server, Mannan for his warm hospitality

The ride to Fullerton on a Friday night is frustrating. The small road going in is jammed and a short distance of about 100m took me about 20 mins to get thru. For a iconic hotel like Fullerton, they cannot expect the rich and famous who is staying in their hotel to be caught in a jam, right?The food was good, fresh and nicely done. Variety was ok, with the cold seafood, sashimi, salads etc. I took the bbq menu, but walking out, I did not see anything that looks appealing from the bbq pits. For the bbq buffet, tiger beer, Spore Sling and juices are free flow.At $89/pax, I thought it was a bit high ended. Think its due to the name Fullerton
4
We were recommended by a local Singaporean. It is mainly a buffet restaurant which is ok but you need to ask for ala-cart menu. Don't bother with anything else just have the Laksa (called Town Laksa). It's a big bowl of noodles, coconut soup, prawns, eggs and its nicely sweet and spicy. Highly recommended
4
Highlight of the buffet was the lobster that is ordered and served to your table There is no limit to lobsters ordered per table Duck and Chicken Rice is yummy Chef at pizza/pasta station was friendly and customized according to your preference Fresh prawns and oysters Spread of buffet is balanced , though not extensive
3
I don't need a breakfast buffet and the quantities of food that it entails, therefore we had al la carte. We were asked if we wanted coffee and we both answered "yes" (even though one of us doesn't particularly fancy it ... there is no coffee cream (just milk ... ugh) outside of North america, it seems. Coffee apparently is SGD 10 (yes, ten dollars.) I don't know if they refill the cup. We were never asked.Eggs over were runny (I like to eat my eggs, not drink them.) Nothing special at all.I suggest you skip breakfast at this hotel
5
Mannan was fantastic, great waiter and my guests from out of town said,"It was fabulous and the location is unbeatable. The sushi was to die for."Twice. Jim had seconds
5
Location: Fullerton Hotel. Nearest MRT station is Raffles; ample parking lots; alternatively, you may use the hotel's valet service (SGD20). From the main entrance of Hotel, this restaurant is located at the left hand side of the hotel lobby. The signboard is not visible from the lobby area though.Restaurant Guest Relation: Welcoming host who showed us our reserved tables. Restaurant Waiters/Waitresses: Friendly and attentive to guests' needs. Never fail to make sure the dirty plates are cleared. Also, always ensure our glasses of water are refilled.Buffet Food: A wide selection of food. We were there for the local delights buffet. You named it - chicken rice, bak cho mee, laksa, satay, hokkien mee, curry fish, curry chicken, etc. They also have seafood selections, Japanese section and a small spread of pizzas. Not forgetting the yummy local desserts, cakes, kuehs, etc.Overall experience: Burp! Yum!Will definitely go back there again. Reservation is recommended to avoid disappointment
5
Food weren't 100% the greatest, but the staff and and environment there was stunning! would definetly be back for more!
3
Had the buffet for the first time. Spread of Singapore, Japanese, other Asian and Western selections but not exactly very wide. Food was OK but uninspiring. I think the Ala Carte selections are much better. Local selections are quite authentic.
4
My first visit to Town Restaurant. Good spread of buffet. Staff is attentive and courteous. Comfortable ambience and suitable for both business and leisure entertainment
5
My son took me here for my birthday shortly before I left Singapore and we had a lovely dinner outside at a table along the river. The buffet was delicious with a wonderful variety of foods to pick from. Service was friendly and helpful
4
There are a couple of good things going for this place:1. It's nicely buzzy at lunch time but not overtly noisy. You can have a proper conversation.2. On true a la carte menu, some of the local dishes worth trying are the laksa (noodles in a spicy curry broth served with shrimp and fish cake) and the chicken rice (poached chicken with fragrant rice made with chicken stock). 3. The Japanese don buri sets are pretty good too - rice bowls with your choice of topping such bad grilled eel or lightly broiled salmon. 4. Service is normally attentive and efficient. At Friday lunch I gave feedback that my Bak Chor Mee (a local dish of egg noodles tossed in a vinegar based sauce and served with minced meat and wontons) was too salty. The manager was quick to offer coffee and dessert on the house to make up for it. What was not so great is the decor which is somewhat staid and in need of a lift. Not all the dishes on the menu are of a good standard (see above).
4
I had celebrated my birthday in Town restaurant very recently with 7 friends, and I had not had a better buffet experience! The ambiance was perfect, the food was delicious and the staffs were constantly on hand to accommodate to our needs. Rachel especially was extremely pleasant, warm and professional in keeping a watchful eye on our table.In other words, I would like to extend my many thanks to ensuring that service standards are consistent, and the food was fantastic
5
We celebrated 3 of us, emailed and they were very attentive and handled reservations perfectly. The food was lovely and sitting by the river for Sunset made it all the more so relaxing. We sat there till closing. Azman who was attending to us served us with true Fullerton hospitality and enthusiasm. While we were waiting for our lobsters he reassured us many times as the BBQ queue for lobster were long on saturday night. He arranged the birthday cake timing after all our meals. and both of them came and sang Happy Birthday song. The chocolate was so delicuious and mousse light. It was just right for after the buffet. We enjoyed the night and thanks to Azman service. He will make you feel at home in Fullerton
4
I remember the Fullerton from when it was the old Singapore Post Office and had always admired the architecture. As we couldn't afford to stay we decided to try the breakfast instead. We would have had the buffet - which looked divine - but couldn't justify the cost when we weren't very hungry - so we ordered from the menu and had mixed results. Nevertheless it was a delightful atmosphere with very friendly staff and at least I got a taste of the Fullerton
3
It was Father's Day celebration so Father gets to eat free. We were there for buffet dinner. Spread was average but then again it costed $69 per pax - not an exorbitant price. There were baked lobster (limited to one half per person) which was a little over done, the usual seafood spread that included oysters and yabbie, very fresh sashimi and sushi, the usual pizza and pasta, oriental selection including roast meats and chicken rice, and Indian selection. Desserts included ice kacang, chendol, Nonya kuehs, pastries, ice cream and fresh fruits. The restaurant was not by quick in replenishing food so I didn't manage to try some dishes. Overall it was an ordinary buffet, although we had expected more because it's part of Fullerton Hotel. Service staff was good and prompt though.
5
On our first night we ate here with friends. They were having a presentation of Thai Food. I have food allergies and therefor was restricted in what I could eat. The chef went around after he found out about my allergies and selected a plate of food that I could eat. 1st Class service. The ambiance was great. Loved everything about this resaurant
4
We reserved a long table by the riverside, to take advantage of the ambiance. The lights twinkling over the water, bouncing off the bridge, and reflecting on the majestic architecture of the nearby buildings showed us that we picked the right location for our double birthday celebration.The food was passable. A solid 4 out of 5 as far as buffets go. There were no particular standouts for me tonight, everything was sort of average. Highs and lows include:- Fresh sashimi / 2 small bones in a couple of salmon- Fresh and delicious drunken shrimp / no olives, too little selections for the salad bar- Delicious oyster vermicelli / bland and tasteless thin pork soup- Exceptional tiramisu cake / dry mini cupcakes It goes on like that, but there were more hits than misses, so that's good.What stood out was the awesome service. Kudos to the staff assigned to the verandah on this particular Wednesday night. Every dirty plate was promptly cleared, utensils duly replaced, water glasses refilled if they so much as reach the halfway point.Other reviews make me curious to try out their brunch buffet. Maybe next time
3
Bbq selection is too little. Just take seafood no need bbq. Not as fantastic as expected due to range of food offered
5
Breakfast variety and taste will amaze you. Outside view is just awesome. And staffs are so friendly that you will forget that you are in a restaurant
5
great views - large buffet -all fresh - worth including in the room rate - poached eggs with spinach great -also have local food - roti and mee - all good
4
Foods are not bad, only thing no drinks for the kids. Hopefully more cakes variety in future, especially chocolate cake
2
3 of us did a 7:15am breakfast meeting and ordered off the menu. Slow slow slow!Service was confused and chaotic. Wouldn't go back.
5
Went to have a birthday dinner with a friend and the food was amazing. Everything was really nice especially the dessert. We had an amazing time there and the service was excellent. A special mention to Darren for surprising us with the delicious Lobsters and to Aloysius for the tremendous service and chat. They both really made our dining experience even better. Looking forward to the next meal there .. very very soon. ^_
5
I've been to Town restaurant at least half a dozen times for the Sunday brunch buffet and it is fantastic. Service is always top notch, and the food selection is excellent. You will never find a food area that needs replenishing as the staff is all over this. Drinks are topped up promptly.Having tried many comparable options, Town comes out on top every time for these reasons:1. High quality food selection2. Diversity of options (breakfast food, any kind of meat, Asian selection, Italian, cheese table, salads, array of fresh seafood)3. High quality service4. Good location (Central, walking distance to Boat Quay and other areas for post-brunch activity)5. Atmosphere - well lit, sunny and cheerfulBonus, they always have a live band and some sort of entertainment - perfect for embarrassing the birthday boy/girl in your group, or for any other occasion
4
Worth trying out the buffet. Nice setting. The lobby itsef is huge and looks majestic. Food wise, pretty standard, though quite disappointed with the seafood selection. Only setback, wanted take the beef teppanyaki , but was told no more....smtg which i find weird. ( first time someone in a hotel tell me that no more dish in a buffet restaurant). so in a way, kinda disappointed with that.Service is very good. Gave me a discount for staying there. Overall, worth visiting
4
The restaurant is indeed worth the cost for the following points:- the staff is well trained from reception to service persons- the ambience is easy and relax- good frontage view of the Singapore river in the evening- food spread is good (mix of local races food, Japanese, shell seafood , pasta and pizza, delicious and fresh- food is tastefully cooked- attentive table serving staf
4
The service crew was great, awesome service rendered. The food variety could be more I feel but the laska is very good!
4
Very nice restaurant overlooking the Singapore river. Very good lunch buffet. Central location makes it good for business lunch
5
I have noticed when reading reviews that the food served in an eating establishment always gets written about; whether good or bad. This time though, I thought I would give the service rendered its due credit.It was relatively quiet, being a weekday evening. The buffet spread was extensive and well spread out. A highlight was the chicken rice, served ala minute. The chicken meat was tender and not too chunky and the rice was cooked to perfection. It was neither too oily nor dry. The service team member Fizah was hospitable. I could tell she loved what she was doing. She was polite and smiled all the time. Keep it up, Fizah! It was a birthday celebration and I was pleasantly surprised that not only was a cake served, but a photograph was also taken of my partner and I. How different it is from other establishments
5
When I found out that Chef Kent Seah was heading the Japanese themed buffet at Town restaurant, I immediately called to make reservations for the family to celebrate my son's 16th birthday. Glad I did as he felt really really special that night. First, even though it was a weeknight, there was a good crowd, and the service staff were kept busy. But they were still quick to clear the table and refill our glasses without being intrusive.I must say the food selection was quite extensive from the cold foods (crabs, oysters, prawns etc) to Japanese ( which also included teppanyaki), local (chicken rice - which was amazingly good, laksa, ice kachang etc), Chinese (including roast duck), to the wide array of desserts, we decided not to have the bbq for an added cost. Still, we stuck mainly with the Japanese food since that was the theme!And once again, Chef Kent didn't fail to impress. What amazed me was the effort put not only into the selection and quality of the food, but also the whole ambience of the restaurant. For instance the food signs on wooden plates hanging from the cooking stations really brought out the Japanese atmosphere. Realizing that my sons love tobiko and ikura gunkan sushi, and that it was my son's birthday day, Chef Kent and his Japanese food team prepared two lovely platefuls for them, as well as a plate of sashimi which looked so appetizing and tasted so fresh! It might be a small gesture but it really made my son feel so special.To end off the lovely meal, Chef brought a small birthday cake and macaroons to our table. We usually avoid macaroons as they are often cloyingly sweet but the ones we had here were really pleasant, and I surprised myself by eating one whole macaroon myself. This was served with a full pot of TWG tea for each person. I had chamomile while the birthday boy had peppermint. As an extra special touch, each pot was accompanied by a small jar of honey. Lovely!One of the wait staff also helped us take a family photo and had it printed on a card for us to take home! Once again a special thank you to Chef Kent Seah and his team, as well as the staff of Town restaurant, for a wonderful evening experience

The buffet in Fullerton, it supposed to be a luxury, but the fact is only the price is luxury.Firstly, it doesn't provide free flow soft drink!!!This did suprised us, becuz such price of buffet normally include soft drink without doubt. It shouldn't cost much. I don't understand.Then, we went on weekend night, it's exp then usual becuz it included 'seafood'. But the fact is, the oyster is terrible to death! We didn't want to pick any of them. They just look like shell only! Other 'seafood' are just kinda normal stuff like prawn and mussel. Oh the mussel is also tiny and thin. Rest of the food is also just so so. I think the price is mostly spent on the river view. That's it. Compare to another 5-star hotel buffet we went last month, we definitely won't go any more
2
Had the seafood buffet and was very disappointed. Food quality is inferior compared to other 5 star hotel's buffets. Wasted my money, time and calories eating at Town Restaurant
2
No snow crabs as advertised, restaurant blackout in the middle. Service was so so. Should have gone for Buffet at Cafe Mosai
5
Very nice airy restaurant part of the hotel. Very friendly and accommodating staff. We ate from the menu but the buffet looked amazing. Wish we could have gone back to have it. The linguine with the crayfish was very tasty.
5
After having been to many champagne brunches in Singapore, the Fullerton is still one of my favorites. It has one of the best variety and quality of food - seafood, foie gras, so many types of cheeses and desserts. Setting is also one of the most beautiful and bright. Great place to bring out of town guests.
3
It is high end. This is the Fullerton after all. But for $84 Sg dollars i expected more. This was the base price and did not include the optional BBQ. The atmosphere and service was 4-5 star. In my view if you are going to charge this price there needs to be something more and I don't know what that is. I can only say that this is the most I ever paid for a buffet and I was not wowed
4
Buffet spread was good but not many variety of food to choose from. Unlimited lobsters was the best of all. Great service too!
4
Nice food and good price Our new regular place to go ❤️❤️Maybe could provide free flow of drink, will be much better for kids
3
Had a weekend buffet dinner with my family. The spread was good and my wife loved the fresh oysters. They also served baked lobsters on order. However, the service was average. After we were seated, the staff just walked away without saying anything and we had to figure out what to do. And there was also this helpful young staff who could not differentiate between wine glass and water glass. He almost wanted to top-up my white wine with water and I had to stop him. Service definitely needs some improvement
4
A good spot for a business lunch. We ordered a la carte, and food was good quality, with the dessert buffet included in the set we ordered. Service was decent, but we had to repeatedly ask for some basic things. i think there are better places to eat in Raffles Place with more personality, but this is a good option for hotel dining
4
The Town Restaurant is in the Fullerton Hotel, a landmark in Singapore. The food was very well prepared and the service was really perfect. The selection on the menu was very wide, including local dishes such as Laksa, all the way to hamburgers. There is also a large buffet available if ordering from the menu does not interest you. The décor fits with the hotel and sitting by the window has a great view go the river across from the museums. take the time to walk around the hotel
4
Free flow Verve and outstanding shellfish are the highlights of the brunch . You can eat and drink as much as you like between 12-3pm. It is quite costly at about £100 per person but it is a lovely old building. Dress code is casual - I think they ask for no sports wear or flip flops but we saw both although most people make a bit more effort with casual shirts and linen trousers for men and pretty summer dresses and sandals for women. Typical brunch range of food so some great salads, curries, roast meats but the feature is the seafood: high quality crab, lobster, oysters, giant shrimp and all delicious! Good band who play from table to table. Fun for a celebratio
5
Staying with friends in Singapore I'd been hearing about these amazing brunches on offer for years, finally I was in Singapore on a Sunday to experience it for myself.One word - AMAZING! The food (and variety) on offer was simply decadent, I've never had anything like it. The incredible fresh seafood station (think I ate my body weight at this station alone - tuna, lobster, crab, oysters ...), the incredible Japanese food selection, the cheeses, the desserts and that not including everything else on offer here too (yep, there was plenty, plenty more) And of course the free flow Veuve Clicquot Champagne .... and the staff, we were incredibly well looked after.We also had a couple of children with us who went off to enjoy the kids club downstairs for an hour or so too :-)Dinner was fnished off with a complimentary Marghareitas! Just fabulous
4
Lots of Champagne and other drinks, regularly topped up. Seafood Station looks amazing but a bit disappointing? Oysters were top class and shockers knowledgable as to type and orignation. lobsters plentiful but did not seem as fresh as one would expect. I suspect that they have been previosly frozen. Lack of imagination with the crab and prawns. All simply boiled, it would have been nice to have crab mixed with some spring onions and sweet peppers and lightly sautéed in butter? Mostly catering for European tastes and a bit too bland for me.Overall, ambience and location quite impressive
2
My friends and myself visited Town Restaurant for their buffet lunch. But for SGD60 for the lunch buffet was totally not worth it. Sure, they served oysters, which we seldom see for lunch buffets. However, my friend had one oyster that was bad. Most of their food were local delights. However, as a Singaporean, their Hainanese Chicken was tasteless. Their roast duck, roast meat and char siew had nothing to shout about. All of their cooked food failed to attract us. For their dessert station, the only thing I loved was their chocolate pudding, which was warm and moist. However, their signature Bread Pudding failed to impress. As for their ice creams, their vanilla ice cream lacked of the fragrant vanilla flavor even though we could see lots of vanilla pod in it. The only food I enjoyed was their sashimi. It was sliced thickly and extremely fresh. For this price, I would not visit Town Restaurant again honestly
5
I had buffet breakfast for 3 days during my stay in fullerton. The buffet breakfast had a very wide variety. Huge variety of fresh fruits, croissants and danish pastries, cereals etc. I dont think you can ask for more when it comes to choice of food.The unique thing about the restaurant was that you can choose to sit out in open next to the riverside. In cities like Singapore where fee hotels have open areas i found this as a huge plus. While there is a large dining area inside..for those who enjoy open air, this is something really good you can enjoy
4
This is my first time trying out their buffet. I was quite impressed by the quality of the food offered as well as the wide variety of local delicacies they offer!
4
It's my first time going inside Fullerton hotel, an iconic and historical hotel in Singapore. Came with a group after corporate meeting. The buffet really served good tasting food with high quality fresh ingredients. Quite impressive for buffet setting.
4
By the riverside looking over buildings, river taxi cruising and historical bridges. Some local foods. Spending family meal observing tourists taking pictures. Service was good, food was above average.
4
Great atmosphere and ambience. Soothing subtle touch to everything. Old fashioned opulence at its best!
5
While looking at this historical building, the lunch buffet caught our eye. The food of course was very fresh, their was a great variety, and the fresh shrimp was a hit with the kids. It was a nice treat.
4
Wide range of food, especially seafood, nice atmosphere, with unlimited champagne couldn't have asked for more - Although a table cloth would have been nic
4
We've dined more than once in this restaurant. It always offers DBS promotions like 15% off buffet. A sumptuous spread of local dishes. My cousin had to stop over singapore for 10hours, I brought her here to experience local dishes and to see an iconic landmark in singapore. The venue and the hotel itself is one of the best.
2
I saw all the good reviews and thought we would have a nice time there, but I was wrong!!! Buffet food spread is just so-so, and the food is so-so as well. We ordered the lobster but it was no where near "nice", it was like frozen and defrosted, so the lobster meat wasn't fresh and chewy, but mushy mushy and salty. Oysters were shrunken and not fresh, I felt weird after eating one. Anyway, I would have rated 3star for the food alone, but had to rate 2-star in regards of the price and service. For a 69++ buffet, but you can't even provide free flow of drinks???? How much can coke/soda cost? Other cheaper buffet provides free flow drinks!!! only plain water was provided, and we had to keep asking the waitresses to refill the water. So disappointed!!
4
We stayed in the Fullerton four night and thus enjoyed four breakfasts in the Town Restaurant. The food is offered in five pavilions, on two levels and no dish is duplicated on another pavilion, thus the lox is on one pavilion, the cream cheese on a second and bread o a third. It took me two days to find my way around, but it was all there. The omelet station was occasionally backed up. You had the option of dining outside, but Singapore is hot, even at breakfast time
5
A group of 6 celebrated the New Year with a superb Champagne Brunch at The Town Restaurant. The array of food and the high quality was very impressive from the hole pig, roast beef, oyster lobster, prawns to the immense cheese selection. The free flow Veuve champagne was delicious and our attentive staff, Ela and James were fantastic. My husband prefers red wine and the merlot on offer was not to his taste so Ela sources a fabulous Aussie red to his delight. The complementary margaritas to finish capped off a wonderful, decadent long lunch complete with party hats and blowers. A great start to the year
5
Ten out of ten it's a huge restaurant and the service is quick and to the point lovely people serving you drinks come quickly everyone smiles and speaks great English
2
Got a table outdoor!! Started to rain heavily after 10minutes there...water was all over our food n table!! Had to wait another 30mnt for another table inside. Overall was a horrible dining experience.
5
The food and service replicates the rest of the Fullerton. pleasant and unhurried.
P.S. Visit XII/2013
5
A Damn good Buffet with Chinese or English cuisine and reasonably priced--you do not have to be a resident and recommend a visit during the week as weekend become noisy
4
Brought my wife out on her birthday. Very nice ambience and she likes it a lot. Have a large variety of food. There're the Italian, Japanese, local, seafood, salad, cheese, soup, Indian, cakes, fruits, desserts, dim sum, meats and beverages sections.Overall good quality is very good... To fit all tastes. Staff service is very good and prompt. very helpful and polite. Of course like all places when the place is completely full of patrons, the staff takes a bit longer to change out the plates... But overall very good.We had a great time and were pleasantly surprised by the cheerful staff that attended to our table.Recommended
5
Have been here a number of times now for lunch, during a number of visits to Singapore. Can't fault it for food, service and price. We've never done the buffet though(!). We always go for an outside table on the terrace and order from the menu - the specialities of the house (left hand side of the menu) are all superb and very reasonably priced. The beer is good and cold too... The views from the terrace are great - it feels very Singaporean! The staff here are lovely and very attentive. And this is without staying at the hotel; if you want a memory of your trip to Singapore, give this a go.
3
With the raving reviews, no doubt Town Restaurant provides an excellent variety of food choices and a nice view to go with. It was all perfect with warm greetings and exquisite service until I was questioned about leaving without paying the bill. Was requested to pay full during reservation, I must be the only one. Disappointing end to a pleasant meal, besides that all's good
3
Have been to the restaurant for dinner buffet a few times! Love the ambience and its thoughtful of them to snap a Polaroid for our keepsake for celebrating the Birthday there! The restaurant has keep a standard for their food but should improve on the BBQ....taste,waiting time.Overall,a pleasant experience
4
Visited this restaurant for high tea several times, lunch several times and Xmas dinner too. The spread various and changed according to theme, amount charged and season. The biggest spread was the Xmas dinner but the price was equally exorbitant. The most value for money is the Saturday high tea. It's called high tea but serves food fit for lunch. There's usually a wide spread of cuisines, ranging from local fare to western, Chinese and Japanese. Service is good and the crew make you feel wanted. Overall, this is a good place to meetup with friends and family.

I just had a dinner to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday on 7th Dec. I chose this restaurant as I heard of his exquisite service and it did not disappoints! 5 stars service with fantastic restaurants ambience. Special Mention for Helen (MVP) which help me with my special birthday arrangement! Rachel for taking our order and taking care of us throughout our dinner experience, Lailanie for taking our reservation and make sure everything is in order for my celebration arrangement and last but not the least, Ashley for delivering a equally magnificent service. Kudos to your team and I really appreciate your cooperation of making this birthday celebration a memorable one. P/S: Sorry to keep bugging you guys with a lot of request though. I know I am being naggy :

Very typical coffee house and their food are very typical. No surprises. The only surprise is their lack of service due to staff shortage.
5
Nice and quiet place, facing the river. Exquisite menu and highly efficient service. A place to go, for specific singaporian gastronomy (special chicken and rice)
5
Not much else to say, really. Food choice and presentation , wine list, ambience and service are impeccable and not extortionately priced bearing in mind the quality of the Establishment. A perfect oasis of charm and good manners.

This is the place to have one of this delicacy when in Singapore!Although more expensive than at the many seafood restaurants, that are located on the way to Changi in the riviera, the taste and quality is superb. Take plenty of money (or a good credit card) as beers and wine are also very expensive. but you must try one for dinner when in Singapore.

Sunday brunch is just fantastic! Another enjoyable experience-tasty dishes, generous drinks and service friendly. Cannot fault our experience yesterday. All sorts of food to choose from-desserts are fabulous and so so many! Perfect Yorkshire Puddings, delish tandoori chicken and curries, seafood, dim sum and satay. Very full, very happy

An excellent venue for a special lunch, this old government building has been sympathetically converted into a hotel and restaurants. Sunday brunch is special. We took the option of free flow Veuve Cliquot for the three hours we were there. No scrimping here, our glasses were always being refilled. Wine and beer was also free flow. The food was outstanding. Lobster, oysters and lots of other seafood. Traditional Sunday lunch available of course alongside Japanese cuisine, Indian and Singaporean dishes. Everything was prepared and presented to perfection. Treat yourself when in Singapore on a Sunday. Well worth it.

I stayed at the Fullerton hotel for several days and had the pleasure of enjoying the breakfast buffet at the Town Restaurant each morning. The buffet offers everything you can ask for and the food quality is really good. I usually chose a seat by the windows facing the river which is a fabulous way to start the day. I can recommend the waffles, the soft boiled egg (the chef also makes a very good omelette) and the pastry. I had some of the Indian curry as well which was fantastic as well. Looking forward to my next breakfast at the Fullerton already
5
What an array of wonderful food. The Champagne buffet is without compare in Singapore and many other places for that matter. What may seem expensive can turn out to be really excellent value for money with the choices available. What is on offer serves to delight. Oysters from France, or Australia? Seafood from all over the world for you to choose from. Different cuisines and Sth,Es to. Jose from. Free flowering champagne. Which during my last visit was the very respectable Veuve Clicquot.I heartily recommend this experience. Always a must whe. We are in Singapore

I wandered in to have lunch and to check out the hotel because of its famous reputation and true to form it was pretty amazing. Subtle class. Unlike the Amoy hotel aka dump where I was staying. There were several choices one could pick for lunch. A Japanese buffet, the huge international lunch buffet in the Town restaurant and a smaller cafe for simple orders. The Town restaurant had several components including fresh seafood, sushi, a meat station comprising of duck, roasted chicken and pork belly. OMG they were excellent. Then various stews, rice and noodle stations, amazing desserts and breads were just a part of the overall offerings. I probably only listed half of the available dishes. The cost of lunch was about $50 US and well worth it. No need for dinner. I loved it so much I cam back a couple of days later to enjoy it again. High quality, polite service and my only complaint is that you are charged for bottled water and only tea or coffee is free. I was put at the worst table by the end of the upper level bar because I did not have a reservation but when I saw the very large hotel professional group flock to the lunch it made sense. Make a reservation so you can get a table by the waterfall
2
Wide spread of food but cakes were limited. Ice kancang station was staffless. Alot of indian food. More for catered for the indians. Rojak was a let down. Extremely hard to even cut or bite. The laksa was too oily. Pizza only had tomato pizza. Only 1 variety! There were not much western food. The satay was nice. The briyani and naan were nice. However very disappointed in the dessert corner. Staff were efficient and friendly
4
Two words, free-flow champagne. Great thing is that the champagne is Veuve Clicquot, so in terms of Sunday Brunch, this one is definitely worth to try. The food selection is good and overall, most of the dishes were tasty. I wasn't a big fan of their risotto though since it was a bit bland for my taste, but I love their Japanese station and they do have an impressive selection of cheese. I suggest you to stay with the champagne to accompany your brunch because the red and white wines are table ones.
4
I visited this place with a group of 12 people for a dinner. The place has nice decor. Good seating area with a nice view of the river. The spread is very good consisting of veg, non veg, local, european style, seafood, salads, desserts. Some of the items included noodles, indian bread, din tai foo, different varieties of cheese and bread. The staff was friendly. The quality of food was also good. There were at least 10 different types of desserts consisting of pudding, cakes, tartines etc. there were 4 different types of ice cream as well. Overall I liked the place. In the local dishes I tried veg dumpling and it was nice.

Given the fact that Fullerton is one of the top ranking hotel in Singapore, I was expecting an excellent quality seafood buffet in its’ Town Restaurant. The Japanese and other raw section were tempting and taste fresh but others were just average. My spaghetti cream sauce was too salty, and the chinese roast duck was too hard to chew. Dim sum - Siew Mai Dumpling wasn’t good either. We didn’t get to sit outdoor near the Riverside(which we wanted badly), due to the bad haze I guess? Overall, in terms of food quality and its’ varieties, my rating is average
4
My friend and I had an early dinner at the Town Restaurant on a Monday.I had tenderloin which was quite good and my friend had a New York steak, also good.The hotel is quite attractive but the decor of this restaurant is nothing special.There are tables outside along the water but as tourists are walking by, it would not be so pleasant to dine outside I feel.The service was very good and the price quite reasonable.If convenient I might dine here again but I would prefer to try another place next Singapore visit
3
Food was so so. Variety acceptable. Ice kachang/Chendol station machine not user friendly. When we asked for assistance from a passing by CHEF for help, he was not too pleased to help. Maybe because my domestic helper asked him to?? Service staff not well trained especially the younger ones
1
staff unable to retrieve my booking and allocated us at courtyard seats which is far away from the cafe. supposed to have unlimited baked cheese lobster but was told that they will serve the lobster to our table. When the lobster served, was cold and not cheese baked. When i ask for top up of water but was told to ask another staff... Satay was not freshly BBQ. They already cooked it and only 'warm up' when request. Satay tasted weird... Overall, disappointed with the service and the food... Don't think i will want to go back again... Will not recommend anyone too... 
4
I cannot comment on the service much since it was an open lunch buffet, but the staff preparing and serving were pleasant and attentiveThe food itself was excellent , the best you can expect from a buffetthey had a sushi/sashimi bar with fresh fish (limited selection of Salmon, Tuna and a white fish ) the food was prepared as it was servedThey had a shellfish bar with oysters, clams, crabs, and shrimpThey had a local food bar with pork, fish, mutton, beef, rice... And limited selection of Indian food They had a fabulous dessert bar, a bread stand The price was Reasonable for Singapore at around 60 sin dollars per person plus drinksI have paid more elsewhere for much less quality and variety , 60 is cheap for what you getThe atmosphere and the place are GRAND, a very nice place Five stars for the ambienceFour stars for food
2
We have just moved to Singapore. My husband took me to the champagne brunch for my birthday. We were both looking forward to it very much. The food is good for sure but the atmosphere is not. The cafeteria look of the place is not to the expected standard. No table cloths, poor service, very noisy. Very touristy. way overpriced. If you want to stuff yourself and get buzzed on ok champagne this is the place. If you want a brunch with nice experience with authenticity and atmosphere look elsewhere
4
This is the attraction "must see" after you have finished the photo ops at the Merlion.At stones throw and on the way to the Marina Bay Sands, this place is open for all visitors(there is a board indicating so, around the hotel).The mesmerising grandeur of hotel is a feast for shutterbugs
5
I used to host our overseas clients at Town restaurant a lot and haven't got a chance to be back until recently when i was planning a dinner gathering with my close friends. I think the last time i was back was probably more than 2-3 years ago.They were running a Japanese theme buffet on top of their seafood / bbq offerings on a saturday (including servings of baked lobster thermidor) and i must say it feels so good to be back. Everyone is as friendly as before if not better and all my friends whom have not dine in Town Rstn before were all singing praises of the ambience, the staff and the food. The buffet range were huge and they have 2 options. You could go for just the Seafood buffet or opt for the Seafood & BBQ buffet at a slightly higher price (with free flow of beer and singapore sling) but we wanted to be alcohol free and the food was more than enough to fill our stomach. I really love how professional and friendly the staff is and the flexibility they displayed was just amazing. Although the buffet only includes hot drinks like coffee and tea like english breakfast tea, i was craving for a chamomile tea instead and when i requested for it, the male staff (i didn't get his name) still serve me a pot of it without any extra charge. He did explain to me usually its not included but will gladly serve me a pot. I think i really appreciate when F&B staff go the extra mile and not be so rigid with their house rules. Its only just a pot of tea but you have won my heart. Thank you Mr Nice guy. I was seated at the courtyard area and feel so relaxed esp with the classical music (live performance) playing at the background.Please extend my appreciation to all your staff including Merlly (from town rstn) and all the staff (including Mr Nice guy) at the courtyard area. I will be back :
5
Excellent spread of food and very good service by the staff especially Mr Azman. Will definitely go back again.
5
Wide selection of good quality food. We got a 30% discount and $50 dining credits as we were hotel guests.
3
Just go for the seafood option will be more worth it.
Bbq selection was limited and don't really taste fantastic.
Great service staffs, excellent attitude.
4
The variety was great! We can choose from local to western and Japanese cuisine. There were plenty of fruits and salad to choose from too. We would have opted to sit outside for the good view if not for the hazy weather.

Had my birthday celebration at Town. Coincidentally, there was a big group celebrating 21st birthday, so it definitely brightens up my evening and the whole atmosphere was different.Food in Town was excellent from the cold seafood, lobster on demand to the chicken rice and laksa - really best local food in SG! Chicken was not overcooked, rice was not too oily. The roasted meat was still crispy when the chef chopped into pieces for me.As for the overall, service was a little lacking as we were at one end of the restaurant. So clearing of plates, refilling of drinks and ordering of lobster were on the slower side until servers catch our hand wave. The cutlery was also dated and old. My tea pot had a loose/broken handle which I had to hold carefully when pouring green tea out. Plates had many scratches and tiny chips. Can be improved upon, slowly but surely
5
The high tea buffet at the Fullerton Hotel was fabulous, lovely restaurant and the hotel had lots of charm. There was a large choice in the buffet selection and was very good value for money. We ate on the Saturday and booked ahead of time before leaving home.
4
This is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore because you can sit outside, right by the river, with a view either towards Boat Quay looking across to the Victoria Concert Hall and Cavanagh Bridge, or the other way down the river towards the Anderson Bridge. People walk past on the path right by the restaurant, a curious experience that is surprisingly not intrusive. The food is a very extensive international buffet. I like going for a romantic dinner, but it is also a great place for a business lunch. The service has always been excellent
2
Went as a block lunch booking of 30 - pre-warned and only two choices of starter/main to make it simple. Took half an hour for starters to arrive (French onion soup was good) but erratic service across the table of 8 with 10 minute gap between presentation. Then another 20 minutes (at least) before a simple sea bass was served - again with delays all round. Fish was ok, cauliflower purÃ©e good. But delays meant no time for dessert or coffee and when I asked if I could get an apple I was given a simple "no" by the surly waiter. The majority of serving staff acted as if working there was beneath them and if it wasn't for all these customers life would be so much easier!! Personally I wouldn't return although it looked like it served a business audience in the main. Pity as potentially pleasant venue
4
Upon first impression when we walked in, the service staff were rather attentive in their service. Overall, it has been a memorable experience and my best friend was happy.The only flaw was we had to ask for refill of ice water at least 5 times. I understand that during dinner time it gets really busy but then again, if you are able to serve the guests next to us and meeting to their extra demands, how is it difficult not to serve ice water? One alternative option is you can serve ice water filled in a glass flask, placed it on the dining table, for guests to help themselves. This is what Marriott Cafe does. We liked the ambience, Fullerton Hotel indeed has impressive interiors and architecture design. I will love to try out other restaurants in Fullerton Hotel. Perhaps, I may consider coming back to Town Restaurant for its wonderful spread of buffet. The Kitchen staff indeed are really fast in serving. Thumbs up!
5
Located within a beautiful hotel, the buffet dinner had a very good selection of choices, from make-your own noodles, sushi and great seafood platter, the usual bain-marie selection of stews and stir-fries, chicken rice, pasta and roast meats, indian stand with curries, roti and naan, dessert sweets. I was pleased to find kuih as part of the dessert selection and make your own cendol. Again too many to list or try in one visit!Great service by the staff, there were times when our orders were being made that they offered to bring it to us when it was ready.As we have made a reservation for our party of 7 adults, they have allocated us in the corner which was nice but there were also outdoor by the river seating which looked great in the evening
3
We ate breakfast here a couple of times during our stay. It was clean and the choice of buffet was acceptable. Service was mixed. I didn't feel the junior staff understood what we were saying. However, there were senior staff on duty to help.
5
the price was not too high for lunch despite it is in Fullerton hotel. Food was good (I had noodle) and it was nicely air-conditioned. Great catch up place with your girlfriend.
5
Excellent food no matter which meal of the day. Very spacious and comfortable restaurant.
Service and friendliness of the staff is excellent.
4
Just experience the eatery of variety spread. Also enjoy having food while sitting riverside with naturale atmosphere.
5
The food was awesome. We had the best buffet we ever had at Town. We were there celebrating my husband's birthday. We had a surprise birthday cake and Polaroid. It would be perfect if we had the alfresco seats.
4
I love the buffet! In Singapore, there is not much buffet I love and this is one of them. Fullerton is also the best choice for wedding dinner as the food is great.
4
Had buffet lunch with my colleagues here at the Fullerton. There's a wide spread of food, and quality is pretty consistent. Local specialties such as Hainanese Chicken Rice and the Cantonese barbecue are pretty good, and at the Seafood section there are fresh oysters, crabs, mussels, and prawns. The sushi/sashimi selection are not big, but all very fresh. The location of this restaurant is great as it has nice views of the Singapore river, and the service is good
5
This is currently one of the best brunches in Singapore. I have been to the Sunday brunch at Town restaurant several times over the last 3 years and it keeps getting better and better, while other favourites like the Greenhouse at the Ritz Carlton seem to drop their standard (no more Moet premium Champagne no more live lobster). Highlights include Australian and Boston lobsters, wide range of Sushi and Sashimi, abundant choice of cheeses and of course free flow champagne (Perrier-JouÃ«t). I will definitely be back next time I am in Singapore
5
Had four buffet breakfasts while staying at the hotel. The best breakfast buffet I have ever seen? There are so many different types of food ramging from fruit, cereals. Juices,Breads and spreads, Indian and local food, traditional bacon and eggs, omelettes made to suit your palette, cold selection, cakes, pancakes and waffles. There are just too many to list. In four days we were still unable to try everything. We chose to sit outside overlooking the river instead of inside in th dining room. Staff are very friendly and efficient. They always do that little bit extra for you. Great place to eat breakfast at your leisure.Also enjoyed the Seafood buffet one night during our stay. Again, variety of food was enormous. We had 3 serves of lobster each which was just mouth watering. Oysters were fabulous. There was so much to try but it was impossible to try everything. We did our best including dessert with a large variety of cakes, ice creams, fruit and chocolate fountain. Staff were so attentive and so willing to assist. Had a great evening there
5
We were invited by our colleague to have dinner at Town Restaurant Fullerton. Despite of the fact the excitement of having dinner at the one of historical buildings, the taste, variation and array of the buffet is exceptional. The waiter is also very friendly. We really had great dinner
4
Stayed in the Fullerton for 3 nights . Ate breakfast 3* and had the buffet lunch , lunch was good , roast duck , char Sui pork , good oysters .
3
For the price that i paid for the breakfast, i can't rave about the food selection. It was mediocre. The asian section has many room for improvement. Nasi lemak was pathetic. The view on the terrace was very good though .
3
not taking the buffer but go for a-la-carte on Saturday lunch. fish and chip has been over fried. staff is not very attentive.
2
Went for the seafood buffet which I have been to a couple of years ago on my last visit to Singapore. Last time it was a very enjoyable experience. This time I felt like I'd wasted my money.The service was distinctly average and not what you'd expect in somewhere with the status of the Fullerton.The lobster tails were not very tasty, smothered in some kind of sludgy sauce and served luke warm. None of the food from the buffet was hot; everything was luke warm and not really that appetising. The only part of the buffet that deserves praise was the sushi and sashimi which were excellent. Everything else ranged from mediocre to average. In summary, absolutely not worth the $69++ for either the food or the service. I've had better food from hawker stands
5
I had attended several meetings in the hotel but had not eaten there. Following the conclusion of our event, our client took us to the the Fullerton for an early dinner and what a super way to say thank you. There is a multitude of eateries in Singapore but none have the class or quality of the Fullerton. Food is unsurprisingly excellent but its the combination of service, ambience, location and quality that adds to a singularly exceptional experience.
5
We were staying at another hotel but had admired this one during or stay and thought we would try dessert there after our delicious chilli crab dinner elsewhere. The Fullerton did not disappoint. Having done zero research, having zero expectations, we wandered throughout the lobby in search of where to eat and found the Town Restaurant. The lovely Shane greeted us, invited us in and showed us to our table. She was the perfect host, efficient, polite and went the extra mile to make our dining experience a great one. The dessert was absolutely superb and the ambience of the restaurant is still fairly intimate despite is being a large, spread out room. The tables and chairs are perfectly comfortable and I would imagine the daytime view is as gorgeous as the evening one. There were large groups and couples and people enjoying cocktails outside in the evening breeze. If you aren't staying here I would thoroughly recommend popping in for one of their delicious desserts. Walk around and check out the art on display, it is easy to while away some time in the expansive, interesting lobby. Not sure about wheelchair access as their are plenty of levels within levels. I imagine well behaved children would be welcome. A stunning property from what we saw and very friendly staff. Enjoy
5
Had the high tea over the weekend @$35++ per pax. Value for the money, there were lots of variety. Indian food station, prata, sushi, nasi lemak, Chinese dim sum, rojak, cold salad pasta, popiah, pie tie, laksa, prawn mee, mee rebus station, nyonya kuehs, pastries, breads, scones, desserts, fruits, tea tarik, All the items were all very well prepared and tasty. This is among one of the best asian food buffet that i have tried compare to other hotels. All service staff very attentive and clearing of empty plates was very prompt, and staff keeps on checking if we needed coffee & tea. They were also very thoughtful towards pregnant friend, they gave a a pillow for her back and also asked if she wants coco drink instead of coffee & tea. Thumbs up for the service this this establishment.
5
I have had Sunday brunch in several of the hotels in Singapore, but my favourite is always the Fullerton Hotel Sunday Brunch. Upon arrival we had an issue with the 1st table offered, then the second table and we liked the 3rd table offering. The point being, we were not made to feel it was our problem, they saw it as their problem and it was resolved without fuss or any drama - which is rare these days. Then the food, just every selection one could wish for and more. Again, the quality of the service is exception, as is the food. The food is all fresh and presented well. There is free flow drinks, from champagne, red wine, margaritas and more. Many may say it is not cheap, but I say you get great value if you enjoy a 3 hour slow brunch with plenty of opportunities to try new foods and are not on a diet. Looking forward to my next visit
5
Have had Brunch here 3 times over the last three years and consistently high standard. Almost every type of food you can think of. I never eat much the day before and no breakfast on the day so I can try small portions of lots of things. Too many things to list. You can have with or without the Champagne. I have tried other Brunches in town, including Raffles but I like this the best. A must do if you enjoy good food. It's not cheap but worth the money
5
The champagne brunch on a sunday is a must especially for lovers of seafood and cheese, a huge selection for you to get your teeth into. They staff are very attentive and constantly topping up drinks (you're glass is never dry in this place). Margaritas are also good.I will definitely be back
4
Was there for our wedding lunch and stayed at loft suite. Very nice food, good service. The hotel staff are very friendly.
4
We had an enjoyable dinner buffet at the Town Restaurant. The selection is good and the service staff were friendly. I personally like their dessert.
1
Not worth the visit.
In no way does it compare to Raffles. The Singapore slings were tasteless, the prices outrageous and the service totally non existent. Awful does not describe. A needs few stronger words.
4
Plenty of different types of food to choose from - mainly Asian cuisines. Service was good. Very popular - can get a bit crowded and noisy.
3
Not wanting to go out after arriving from a long flight, my wife and I opted for the buffet at our hotel. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was buzzing. An extensive array of Singaporean ( all varieties of Chinese and Indian) delights were complemented by Japanese and some western food. One could not fault the variety or indeed the quality. If you wanted to be greedy I guess you could stock up all night, but we found it expensive. Willing and helpful staff.
4
We liked the wide choice of foods available and the fact that you can get in and out of there fairly fast. Drinks service was good. We didn't like that the restaurant was very full and noisy, but there is nothing that can be done about that and others may even like it.
3
Was looking forward to the dinner buffet at Town Restaurant. But was a little disappointed with the quality of food. Roast meat was not crispy, pasta was undercooked, not too great a spread of food.Only saving grace is the fresh sushi and sashimi. Desserts was also ok. Prefers other buffet spreads by other hotels in town
5
Breakfast at town restaurant is heaven, you will be spoilt for so many choices! This is 1st time I ate breakfast for almost 4hrs hahaha! Staffs very nice still cont serve us tea even after breakfast buffet is closed. What can I say more! This is good life!!! :
5
This is in my opinion the best brunch in Singapore. Great selection of food which all taste fantastic (except the outside barbecue, get rid of that..), great drinks - champagne, margaritas and awesome service throughout. I tried this brunch a year back and think that it has improved greatly. The Sunday brunch at Fullerton is a must visi
3
Our first visit was a few years ago. It certainly made a great impression and many time during these years we continued talking about it. We couldn't wait to go back. We finally went back and although it was good, the quality and selection lamentably changed and not for the best. Oysters hardly noticeable, moreton bay's tail wasn't cut but you had to do it on your table which is not easy as you have to be strong in order to break it to extract the meat. BBQ must improve or disappear from the buffet; although a good idea, it is truly BAD implemented. Few desserts and breads, both of just okay quality. Service was good but not outstanding. The very only thing that wow us was the cheeses.
5
What more can I say! Because the quality and freshness of the extensive buffet is so good, we ate here several times. Much better than going to a more expensive restaurant for the same food. A big 'Yes'!
4
Have the opportunity to try their buffet lunch as attending a seminar in the hotel.
The varieties of food is good, from local food to international food, I like the shashimi, fresh oyster and other sea food ... Dessert also quite good :)
4
Enjoy thebuffet lunch especially for the unlimited supplied of Lobster, Oyster, crayfish, Sashimi etc
5
Enjoy an extensive buffet looking out over the Singapore River - fabulous. But what really makes this place are the staff.
4
We visited the restaurant for my birthday dinner. A lovely restaurant situated within the iconic Fullerton Hotel. Staff were very polite, friendly and professional. Food variety was pretty good (Sushi, sashimi, fresh seafood, Asian dishes, desserts) and the standard buffet includes a grilled lobster, which is great considering $59++ per person.Their bread and butter pudding was to die for. Do not miss it!At the end of our dinner, I was surprised with a birthday cake and a photo of us to take home. Thank you for the memorable birthday dinner
4
I am not a big fan of buffets, therefore my review and critics might be a bit off. The quality served is good, the choice of Japanese, Thai, Korean, Malaysian, Indian and Chinese food are great, the only thing is - it is to much. You could eat hours until you explode. What is a bit ridiculous are the prices for drinks. A pint of beer 23 SD is a joke
4
My colleagues and i(A total of 9 of us) decide to try out the buffet here as well as taking this opportunity to catch up with each other. The ambience was nice and cozy. The Buffet spread had quite a variety like japanese, thai, asian, western($69++) and additional barbequeue seafood($89++). The dessert spread(Western and local) had quite alot of option to choose.the only thing that my colleagues feedback was that the crab was that fresh. The only that my colleagues agreed on was that the cold seafood(crab) wasnt that fresh, other than that everything else was great
5
Visited the famous Fullerton Sunday brunch with family and can say in all honesty that the experience was amazing from start to finish. we opted for the champagne brunch and although not cheap at roughly Â£85 it is great value, the food was vast, something for everyone and plenty of it, the bubbles were constantly topped up and we had the best time trying almost everything, from fresh lobster to a fabulous Sunday roast, i would have no hesitation in doing it again, if you're looking for a special treat, you won't be dissapointed, just remember to bring your appetite
5
Town restaurant is an excellent choice for a very high quality lunch in the business district. The restaurant is always busy, which is a good sign, but never feels crowded. Great buffet and also an a la carte option. Food is very good, portions are generous, comes fairly fast, and is very reasonably priced for such a nice setting. On this visit we were lucky to be served by Lailanie who is an excellent waitress, knows the menu well and tells us what we might like, and she was correct, and she is also very friendly and good at looking after her customers
4
Was here for a business meeting and was quite upset that the service staff could not find our booking. The manager Mr Eddy Neo attended to us and apologise for the overlook of service. We would like to compliment Mr Eddy service and speedy remedy action to have us seated and have the drink serve to us immediately. Not only he have us seated in a quick time, he also get a service staff to attend to us. With his leadership n his team service, at least it make our da
3
You can get the local food elsewhere in Singapore. Maybe at better price or quality. Chicken rice, satay, fried rice and mee goreng can be found elsewhere. The pasta is nothing special.
5
We went for lunch for the international buffet. WOW great choices, great food, ambient surroundings, great service. Worth every penny.
5
We stayed at the Fullerton and ate breakfast here as it was included in our room rate we experienced impeccable service and fantastic amount of choice on offer Japanse, Indian, English ,Coniental breakfast to name a few !!! Fabulous
4
Sunday brunch at one of Singapore's classic colonial hotels. Excellent choice of seafood, desserts aren't bad. If you don't mind the heat, then get a table outside facing the river. I really liked the Hawaiian themed musicians that go around and play songs for each table. Good service. Friendly ambience. Get there early to make use of the free flow
5
We were spoilt for choice here. So many varieties offered at this Friday night buffet. There was 1/2 lobster served to each guest (can be ordered if you wish to have another). Buffet includes tea/coffee. A canned drink costs $10++. I like the seating, a little more spread out. Service staff is wonderful & clearing of plates always well done. The only overwhelming thing was the journey to the carpark
4
We sat outside which has a nice view of the river (although currently some construction on the other side so a little bit of noise going on). We had salads which were very good but the chicken ceaser had a distinct lack of chicken so marks down on portion size. Service very good. Worth a visit - seems to have wide ranging menu
2
Had family lunch last Saturday. Good spread of Asian popular dishes such as popiah, satay, laksa, fried carrot cake, etc. Except for a few dishes like laksa, prawn mee which are acceptable, most are very mediocre. The kambing soup is a joke. It is starchy like cheap Chinese shark fin soup. The satay peanut sauce was watery and the ketupat seemed like coming from freezer
3
We stayed at The Fullerton Hotel for a night and we managed to have two meals, a lunch & a breakfast at the Town Restaurant. Dined here for lunch right after checking in. The buffet spread was extensive. Western, Japanese, Indian and local cuisine were few worth mentioning.The food tasted mediocre and there were less vegetarian dishes given that they were serving multi-cuisine buffet. We were told that the restaurant will be closed in 45 minutes but we were rushed to have our coffee when we were half through our meal, with 20 minutes to spare. The breakfast was good but I found many dishes that were served previous day for lunch, were seen again in the breakfast buffet spread. Especially, the Indian and local cuisine dishes. We decided to dine along the corridor with the view of the Singapore river but the pigeons made us regret our decision and the fellow diners who were seated beside us. We spent mist of our time, keeping the birds at bay.Overall, the food was pretty average and repetitive.

The restaurant puts a lot of effort into their breakfast and lunch buffets but have difficulty in measuring up to a lot of the other 5 star restaurants/hotels in town. All the ingredients are there to deliver, but the execution is not up to expectations when competing at this level

I went back to Town recently for buffet dinner, this time on a Sunday. Sunday dinners are cheaper, at ~S$50++ per adult, but there are no options for seafood or BBQ unlike on Saturdays. The buffet spread is still international, and they still offer quite a good mix of the different cuisines.I felt that the price was rather worthwhile, as they still do offer oysters at the cold seafood section. In fact, looking through the old photos, a lot of the stuff offered here remains the same. E.g. the sushi and sashimi section is almost the same; they continue to offer local delights like dim sum, satay, prata, as well as chicken rice etc. In any case, the standard remained consistent, so no complaints from me =) My favourite was still the Japanese corner; I’d be satisfied eating that alone!The one which I felt improved a lot since my last visit was definitely the desserts. I’m not one who usually goes for orange-flavoured desserts, but the orange crepes that day were so good! The chocolate as well as lemon meringue tarts were fantastic too. The chocolate was just pure bitter decadence, while the acidity of the lemon meringue tarts really packed a punch. The apple strudel was another winner; I must say they were really generous with the apples. I also really liked the mocha and espresso desserts, which were quite intense but flavourful at the same time. I suggest avoiding the local desserts (i.e. the nonya kueh and chendol); there are better versions of the desserts to be found elsewhere. Also surprise disappointment was their “signature” bread and butter pudding, which tasted so much better the last time. The consistency and texture of the pudding was just off, and I didn’t really appreciate the addition of sweet potatoes into the pudding either.In my previous review I mentioned that the hotel’s decorations changes with the seasons. Right now you can find Easter decorations in Fullerton, though it’s not as extensive as the Christmas ones, and can only be found at the main lobby. I didn’t mention this before (I honestly still can’t quite figure out how I missed it the last time), but the view outside of Town restaurant is actually quite remarkable. The al fresco dining area of the restaurant is by the Singapore River, specifically between Cavanagh and Anderson bridges, so you can not only see water taxis cruising along the river, but landmarks close by as well. Near Cavanagh bridge, for example, is the sculpture “Celebration” by Chong Fah Cheong, though people usually just call it “Kids Jumping into the River”. There are also other sculptures nearby as well, so do venture out and explore after your hearty meal

Exceptional Sunday brunch! Had everything imaginable for food selection. Fresh seafood, carved meats, made to order omelettes, etc. Huge selection of desserts too. We especially enjoyed the free pouring champagne and the Bloody Mary's. They didn't skimp on anything. Expensive? Yes, but so worth it!
5
We visited here four times whilst in Singapore. The quality of the food was excellent and staff very attentive (especially Ella). We liked it so much we kept going back.
4
Buffet here is good value - includes unlimited beer and singapore slings and service is excellent.
I was also given a discount for staying in the hotel.
1
Corn served on ice kachang has turned bad. Roti prata was not made ala order even though the restaurant was relatively empty, leading to cold hard pratas that was unpalatable. The other local fares on offer are of average standard at best.
4
We had the $89++ seafood bbq deal which was the buffet plus half a grilled lobster, all the beer , softdrink and singapore slings you could drink and a buffet that had heaps of seafood inc shellfish, roasts, japaenese, pasta, pizza, salads, deserts etc etc. amazing really, and service was very good too. Great value and food was very nice. We were there with a bunch if vietnamese women who love shellfish and they ate their way through the shellfish and had big smiles on their face
2
We came here for an a la carte breakfast on Feb 23, and were deeply dissatisfied by the quality of experience. The food and service were OK (average, not high class), but the restaurant was poorly managed and maintained. The floors, tables and tableware were dirty and stained. And I was very surprised to see a "Lipton yellow label" tea bag tag hanging from my tea pot instead of a freshly brewed tea. Restaurant management clearly fails to maintain good quality of service. Don't go if you expect a 5-star service - you will be disappointed
5
This was our fourth visit to this restaurant for the Champagne Sunday brunch and yet again was a fabulous experience! The quality and variety of the buffet is outstanding and the champagne flutes were constantly topped up. Although it is not cheap it is good value and a delightful treat for a special occasion
5
My friend organised a birthday party for his son turning 1 year old at this restaurant. Having a party at a buffet restaurant is good, cos the guests can choose from a variety of cuisine and also you can walk around the restaurant to burn some calories, allowing you to eat more! The restaurant has several station sited mainly bear the entrance of the restaurant on 2 floors:- Chinese Noodle: Laksa, prawn noodles and Mee Rebus were available - Japanese Food Section: Variety of sushi, appetiser and soba noodles. - Indian Food Section: Nasi Briyani, Indian Fish curry and Butter chicken. - Prata and Roti John live station. - Cooked Food section: Popiah, Kueh Pie Tee, Peranakan Ngoh Hiang (Spring Rolls), Nasi lemak, Fried Chicken Wings, Satay, Kambing Soup, Steamed dim sum and Glutinous rice - Breads & Pastries: A variety of Sandwiches and pastries, both sweet and savoury. - Desserts: Chendol, Sea coconut, Tau Suan, fresh fruits, local kueh (pastries), Egg tarts, Black sesame paste, Yam custard. I am very impressed with the range and quality of food on offer for the buffet spread. The focus of the buffet has more emphasis on local food, with some western and Japanese selections to cater to customers who want variety. In particular, I liked the following: Indian Fish curry, Kambing Soup, Peranakan Ngoh Hiang (Spring Rolls), Yam custard Dessert. The Roti John was exceptional and is a must try, because of the egg and meat topping they used to fry with the bread. Being a local, I find the flavours were authentic. Overall the quality of food here is good and they provide a good selection of selection to cater to most taste buds. I had a good time eating through the buffet spread. The staff were also attentive and cleared the plates efficiently and attended to our requests quickly. Highly Recommended

Its an opportunity to visit another classic hotel in Singapore and have dinner there. We found the service to be excellent and very professional and the buffet, whilst not cheap, was of a very high standard with a wide range of cuisines on offer. My favourite was the laksa that you prepare to your own choice, rather hot but absolutely delicious. We were able to find a table outside on the side of the river so had a great view of boats and people passing
1
For its price, food standards left much to be desired. Most of the food looks like it has been catered with little being prepared at the restaurant with the standard being worse than what's served at hawker centers. Service is lacking with 2 waitresses overseeing 15 tables during lunch time
4
Excellent international selection. Can get a good deal that includes beer in the price. If not too hot, sit outside on the riverside
5
Went here for lunch - fantastic food and very good service. Given the price, that's to be expected, but it's well worth it
5
Had dinner at the restaurant yesterday as I am currently staying at the Fullerton. The food was delucious and fresh and the waiters were attentive. Did not disappoint. Well worth a visit
5
A great restaurant with good food and excellent service you can choose from menu or buffet dinner and be seated inside or on the veranda at the side of river over looking the lights of Singapore
3
limited selection of seasonal seafood, full of local delights and overall a good place for gethering
4
I enjoyed an al fresco breakfast at Town Restaurant with a table outside right next to the river. Although it's a bit bothersome for one of our companions who had to put up with moving his chair to make way for the passer-bys. We especially enjoyed the excellent selection of local breakfast items, kaya toasts and local coffee and the availability of continental breakfast food spreads. I just hoped that they were open a bit longer
2
Had their Seafood buffet, Beside the Hainanese Chinese, roast duck and dessert , The rest of the food is horrible. The Laksa's pigeon egg is like rubber. Lobsters are.not fresh. Ask the manager what drink is FOC from the buffet. He mentioned only plain water. After that we realised coffee and tea is FOC too. Dishonest Act. Only the receptionist, waiters and chef's service is up to standard. Manager's service is bad. Standard drop Vs the last visit 7 years ago.
2
I love the Fullerton, and always book business lunches thre for ease, but lately the service has really dropped.Yesterday at lunch we had to:1. ask four separate times for an extra place setting2. ask twice for a steak knife (who can cut a tough steak with a normal knife?!)3. eat tough steak (!)4. put up with the embarrassing situation of dessert ariving twenty five minutes apart5. ask multiple times for waterBusiness lunches need to be turned around in 1 hour and 20 minutes, max. Two hours is a luxury that most busy people can't afford!
3
Food was good for hotel standards, nothing spectacular, but at least it did not disappoint. There was a good variety of different types of food, which provided diners with various options to choose from.Service however, was commendable. Waitresses Tsui Ling and Jane were exceptional in their service, being very attentive and patient with our requests. Much appreciated, for a pleasant and chill-out evening out! :
5
Brunch at the Fullerton has lived up to its reputation as a class act. Our free-flowing New Years Luncheon was outstanding. French champagne and delicious fare from around the globe. Incredible seafood, amazing sashimi and sushi, roasts, salads, pasta, curries, cheeses and desserts. The food always looked fresh and never picked-over. Friendly staff added to the experience
4
Quite busy during the mornings - it has a decent b'fast spread with wide continental and chinese selections. Worth a visit
5
We booked ahead of time to have Christmas Dinner @ The Town and were not disappointed. The food is amazing, the service was perfect (thank you Rachel) and we ended up having a conversation with the family at the table next to us making the whole experience fun and memorable.Like last time we dined (although not at Christmas) we tried small bits of lots of the choices and yet we did not try everything due to the sheer number of choices available.Having eaten here in the past we had expectations which this exceeded and we will absolutely do this next time we are in Singapore during Christmas
4
Historic hotel known for Hainanese chicken rice. Beautiful setting. Service is quick but not personable. Food varieties excellent for international night ranging from salads to sushi to roast turkey to breads to laksa to Indian food and Italian food. Dessert looks appetizing. Price is reasonable by hotel standard. Worth to try once.
5
We went wth family to Town Restaurant on Christmas Eve. The spread was amazing. Very high quality and so much to choose from. The desserts table was set apart and so I didn't have a preview, but my goodness, when I got there, I wished I had not eaten so greedily from all the seafood, meats, salads and cheese tables. I am going to single out the cranberry sauce for special mention as an example..... the cranberry sauce you say?....... but even the simple cranberry sauce was so full of flavour of fruit, cloves, cinnamon, with perfct sweet acidic balance..... mmmmm...... believe me the perfection of the sauce was a microcosm for the standard of all else. The free-flow champagne was delicious and truly flowed-freely with great attention from the waiter.The ambience was perfect with good space between dining parties, yet close enough to feel the family Christmas party spirit. We will go again next year! Merry Christmasses to come if you dine here

Celebrated a relative’s birthday here recently, and I must say the place was definitely worth it! Here at Town, diners get to choose if they want the seafood buffet option, or the seafood buffet plus BBQ option (S$73++ and S$93++ respectively; prices quoted here are for Saturday dinner). Since it’s the Christmas season, there are some festive dishes available as well. I only took the seafood buffet option, so my review is limited to the seafood buffer option only. The buffet serves international cuisine where there’ll definitely be something that’ll suit your palate. Seafood-wise, the seafood here is served fresh with sufficient variety. They even served us complimentary lobsters halfway through our meal as part of the buffet! Ooh, the meat was so thick and juicy it was such an awesome delight! The sashimi here is thickly-cut, and also just as fresh; you have sashimi masters who are literally just waiting for you to sweep the sashimi off the plate so he can top it up. Most of their other mains are spicy in one form or another (i.e. black pepper, chilli, sambal etc.), so it may be a slight issue if you can’t really take spicy food. For their local dishes, I would say the “die-die-must-try” ones (for me at least) would be the Chicken Rice, Laksa, and Mee Rebus. The satay was quite decent, nothing really special though. They have dim sum, which I suggest you consume while they’re still hot; the pork bun for example, tends to dry up when left to cool. My only other gripe would perhaps be the mysterious case of disappearing chefs?! The night started out with maybe two or three of them, which then later dwindled down to one, who was so busy tending to the pasta station that there was no one to chop up the chicken or meat to go with the chicken rice =/For the festive items, only the roast turkey and turkey stuffing were offered as mains; most of the festive items offered were desserts. I was quite impressed that the chefs managed to lock the moisture into the turkey meat quite well, so the meat came out tender and tasty. For the festive desserts, there was pumpkin crème brulee, chocolate cherry yule log, Christmas pudding with vanilla sauce etc. On the whole, I generally preferred their festive desserts, especially their chocolate ones, which were rich but at the same time, not too sweet.One thing I really appreciated was their good grasp of the restaurant space. They spilt the diners into different, smaller sections, so you don’t get that overcrowded feeling. Also, you have crew members assigned to care for each section as well, so the service you get here is actually quite personalised and efficient.Other things to note, the restaurant is located behind the Courtyard, so from the outside it kinda looks like a restaurant-within-a-restaurant. It doesn’t really help that the restaurant sign is blocked by a pillar too… For the not-so-mobile, kindly also note that the buffet area is split up into two main areas, and there are steps involved! Complimentary parking is also available if you dine at Town, but the coupons can only be redeemed from the hotel reception. Lastly, there are lots of Christmas decorations scattered all around the hotel, so whip out those cameras people and go trigger-happy people!!! =

The Fullerton Sunday Brunch is an experience not to be hurried. We took five hours. Our glasses were never empty of Perrier Jouet - all included in the quite reasonable price given the volume and quality of the food choices. If the weather isn't too hot and humid a table outside under a fan is recommended. The short walk to the glorious buffet does one good between plates. We have learnt years ago to pace one's self.The range of choices across seasfood, meats, oriental dishes, fab cheeses and luscious deserts plus good coffee warrants one paying honour to the chefs by trying everything. This buffet is equal to the wonderful Sterling Brunch in Las Vegas. We are diverting through Singapore in 2015 to do it again

My husband and I had the great pleasure of taking two friends visiting (one American) to the most wonderful Thanksgiving Dinner of all time at Town Restaurant last week. The Fullerton is a very special hotel, and the food we ate here was top class. We have travelled the world over and we have never seen such a generous spread of varied, delicious, high quality and beautifully cooked food as this. The seafood choice was unbelievable, the sushi, cheeses and salads wonderful, all the roasted and cooked meats were moist and full of flavour - and as for desserts - this really was a triumph, my companions and I could not praise this highly enough. Well done also to the lovely staff who were the icing on a magnificent cake
5
Beautiful setting (ask for a window table) - the hotel reception is really wow! Lovely staff, our dedicated waiter made sure we were always topped up, table cleared quickly, napkins always refolded when we were away getting more delicious food. The quality of food is excellent - lobster, sushi, eggs benedict, and the desserts are simply divine!Impressed with the great service - good food and ambience!Highly recommende
5
Not only the place is lovely but the food is too die for ' choicd is overwhelming ! Massive lobsters, crab claws, sushis, indian curry, pasta and pizza station, enormous cheese and bread selection, and an infinite choice of desserts including a waffles and ice cream station. All that with free flow champagne or wine, what a great way to spend your sunday !!! we were with our son and he was offered a Fullerton stuff bear, which was lovely. Staff is nice and smiley. The only little thing was the cold pan steares foie gras which was cold, you definitely to keep it warm ! Anyway we have already booked our next visit !!
5
The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly...they kept me filled up on coffee without me having to ask. There was something for everyone, no matter how much or how little you wished to eat. You can't go wrong if you enjoy breakfast and you feel it's the most important meal of the day
1
bland food and japanese selection was found to be rather salty. Wait staff that was friendly but not the guy behnd the pancake station.
4
We were staying at the Fullerton si breakfast here was included. The variety is great with excellent service to match the food quality. Would recommend it highly.
4
Food was good, there were oysters~ Yes! Oysters! for lunch buffet, something that's very rare. Love the sashimi too. Decent Spread, decent desserts. Would definitely go again.
4
Service at the restaurant was great right from the time I made my reservation online. Food quality was high and we had a wonderful time. We will definitely return for another enjoyable time at the Town restaurant.
5
I booked the Champagne brunch for my boyfriend's Birthday to celebrate at the Fullerton Hotel this year and it did not disappoint. Free flowing Champagne, Red, White Wine, Bloody Mary's, Margarita's, Coffee, Delicious Orange Juice, excellent service and a huge array and selection of food to choose from. My main recommendation is to reserve a table outside on the terrace overlooking the River, as this makes it extra special. They have fans set up outside so that you are not too hot.There was a lovely touch where a singer and guitarist came over and sang a beautiful rendition of Keane's 'Somewhere Only We Know' at our table, and then later on came to sing Happy Birthday with a surprise chocolate cake and personalised card and photo of us taken at the table to remember the occasion. Very thoughtful we thought. Make sure you mention if it is someone's birthday when you make the reservation.The food choices were great! There is a breakfast station, Roast dinner section, Indian station, Cheese table, pastry and bread table, pasta live station, sushi live station, very large seafood station and excellent dessert area with waffle station. The only thing I would say is that the food does get slightly cold at the stations and none of the food we ate was actually piping hot, which was a shame. This is one thing they could improve on. Make sure you pace yourself haha! It was a lovely way to spend the day and I would recommend it to people wanting a lovely atmosphere in a stunning traditional hotel with a great variety of food options

Tonight we went to Town Fullerton hotel for dinner but was told it was full house.Service staff Ghazil Abbas and Elsa were very approachable and help us to find two table for nine of us. The hotel has barbecue seafood and huge fantastic lobsters. Even though the restaurant is full house, both staff Ghazil and Elsa are very efficient and fast to clear our table and serve with ever ready smile. Good ambience and awesome food with free flow of beers, cocktail drinks and fruit juices. Thumb up for the food and the service, will definitely come back. Joy LeeSingapor

Took my elderly parents to this restaurant during their recent visit to Singapore. Took advantage of the S$68++ buffet menu (quite affordable in terms of 5star hotels) and was pleasantly surprised at A) the wide range of foods offered and B) the quality. Service during the meal was excellent. My parents really enjoyed the meal and the beautiful surrounds (we sat at an outside table adjacent to the Singapore River). Will definitely take other guests to this venue
4
The cold seafood spread consist of oysters, scallops and prawns. Always fresh and enjoyable. The sashimi bar serves 3 types of fish only but it's more than adequate for lunch. A very considerable spread continues to roast beef, cheeses, local delights and more! I think very value for money for lunch in raffles place. Coffee is bad though, this is one area that must be improved
3
The lunch started on a wrong foot. There were 2 reservations under the same family name. But the waitress at the door didn't check that there were 2. While I was parking my car, she showed my teenage daughter and a bunch of elderly in the family to the other family that was seated earlier. Imagine my horror when they were turned away. We had a reservation for 10 and where were we to go in the vicinity without a reservations. A second check with the computer showed our reservations and we were promptly seated.The plus points :1) Enjoyed the birdnest crabmeat soup with generous slice of black truffle.2) Yam balls with truffle.3) Xiao Long Bao.4) Egg tarts infused with ginger was light and delicate.5) Waiter Forest was always busy changing our plates and filling up our tea cups.The negative :1) Limited ordering time of 75mins, during this time the service was slow. We had the 1.15pm - 3pm seating and last order was 2.30pm.2) The special one-per-diner which is fried mantou with chilli crab, it is full of MSG and not worth the calories.3) When the senior waitress asked if we had any last orders, she kept all the menus and walked away. So what were we supposed to do? So we took some time to recall what we had which was good for seconds and had to flag her down. Of course she looked annoyed.The surprise :1) Standard dim sum fare like har gao, siew mai and braised chicken feet were below average. 2) The restaurant was dark and dim despite windows in the main hall, not an ideal place to bring senior members of the family. 3) The service was below par.The neutral :Price per pax was nett $45.00
2
I arrived at the restaurant for a quick lunch before a meeting. I was seated promptly. After ten minutes (timed) I flagged the waitress so I could order. (1:10 pm). At 1:30 pm my drink had not arrived. After a desperate effort to get the attention of the staff, I was able to ask about my drink. As I was asking my food was delivered. 1:35 pm. The food was bland and below average. I wanted to order another drink and again I had difficulty getting the attention of the staff. Finally I received the drink and asked for my bill. After a long wait I received the bill and paid $24 ++ for 2 diet Pepsis and another $24++ for a plate of bad food. Certainly a disappointing experienc

My wife and I went to the Sunday afternoon champagne buffet.
The location, surroundings and staff are superb.
The food quality was excellent and staff kept us topped up with free flow champers.
I was last here in 2007 and it is even better now.
3
Just had a buffet with my friends and I have to say the buffet was just so so even a little bit disappointed. There was not much choices and sashimi was not fresh enough.
Won't come again.
1
Waiter was sneezing and literally wiping his nose in front of me. Steak -microwaved, potatoes - reconstituted. Aweful
2
we slept in the hotel 3 nights and the breakfast was amazing. so a lazy night we decide to stay in hotel and have dine here. well, thought i was at breakfast time again. maybe was that night but the food was too salty.
5
Love the morning breakfast and Sunday Champagne brunch also love wonderful menu.. They are serving all kind of cheeses. Staffs are very friendly and restaurant is very well maintained.
3
Went for dinner buffet with friends (without BBQ spread), the cold seafood spread is decent but oysters were alittle disappointing compared to other hotel buffet I had at Conrad and Rendezvous. The sashimi cuts are chunkier and they did not have my favourite tuna. I highly recommend their cheese, nuts and bread which were very very delicious and went well with the wine we had. Service was OK but the staff were a little inexperienced, was surprised that the manager was openly telling the staff off in view of the customers though. Overall was still a good dining experience. Not too crowded on a Thursday evening
3
This buffet provides a reasonably priced opportunity to taste many different local dishes. There are numerous stations that prepare the food for you. Raw bar offers shrimp scallops mussels oysters all fresh and lovely. Indian bar. .. Good curries. Malaysian bar. . Laksa soup. Sushi bar. Salad. . Etc etc. . Desert bar of course. Service needs a lot of work.. slow. Utensils should be replaced more often. But all in all it is a good air conditioned quality food experience. And if course the hotel is just beautiful. Take a walk on the river after dinner. .. Delightful.
5
It is always a pleasure to take our breakfast at the Town restaurant: the spread is huge ( western, japanese, indian etc), service excellent and the setting unique; you can either it indoor or on the terrace, right by the river while enjoying splendid views on the park across as well as some colonial buildings in the background: unmatched in Singapore.We also had dinner there: we can't comment on the buffet but the a la carte were very good. As a restaurant is rather large this is not a couple's romantic destination unless you eat outside on the terrace
5
Celebrated our special day at Town Restaurant with Family overseas. Need to cater for both Asian / Western taste buds we took a leap of faith and tried Town Restaurant out (we had resto at W Hotel/Fullerton Bay Hotel & Capella as options) and we couldn't be more Happy we did!Seafood was fresh and selection was good, so was the Italian and Local table. Dessert pastries was decent. What made this place extra is the service though and we all know it's hard to find good quality service. With an extra smile and attentiveness from the whole team, that was great. But what made our visit Fantastic was Azman. He went the extra mile and beyond to make our visit Fantastic and we'll definitely come back before our next Anniversary. Great Work Azman & Team! You made our Special Day Amazing!- Mrs. Tedd

On a positive, the hotel is really beautiful and the setting offers a quaint view of the river and Boat Quay. This however is where the positive comments end, we went for the "Seafood buffet" dinner on a Friday night and was hugely disappointed. Not only was the quality of food very average (under seasoned, small selection of seafood available, mis-match of food). It reminded us of being at a Hawker centre but then being required to pay 5 Star prices ($69 pp ++). Wine was also very expensive, with the house wine coming in at $19 ++ per glass and a bottle $98 ++.The service was also hit and miss, for example I was carrying two plates of food (one for me and one for my husband) and then had to push open the door with my back rather than one of the staff members help me out. We were also sitting outside and had a constant stream of pedestrians walking past our table this meant that every time I went inside I had to take my purse inside with me. Would not recommend for tourists or locals alike, no value to be had here
5
Very convenience restaurant that serve buffet breakfast with plenty choices. Having a seat outside near the river is beautiful. Perfection in the morning for coffee and waffle.
4
Food from all over the world. Really delicious. Constant refills of champagne. A nice way to treat yourself while you are in Singapore. I would definitely recommend and go again.
5
It was my first time lunching at Town Restaurant, Fullerton Hotel. The service was first class. As my family member is wheelchair-bound, when we arrived at the restaurant, Karla, one of the staff quickly looked for a cushion so that it was more comfortable for my family member when she sat on the chair. I did not request for it and Karla took the initiative to do so. Additionally, I had the privilege of having a quick look at the spread a day before we patronized the restaurant, Karla's patience and clear explanation on that first day helped me make my decision on having our meal at the restaurant. Apart from Karla, special mention goes to Maisarah, Jerry and Eri who were helpful, caring and definitely made our day. Back to the food, the spread was good and so was its quality. Though they were mainly local food served during lunch, there were Japanese food such as sashimi, sushi; Indian food such as Tandori Chicken (salad) and others; western food such as sliced medium rare beef with special sauce, Brûlée and a pudding that is popular with the British (I forgot its name, it has bread in it),and various types of cakes. The lunch also has oysters & prawns. Chinese food like Bak Kut Teh (Pork ribs cooked in special tasty clear soup, a little different from the dark soup we usually get when eating at other Bak Kut Teh eateries) Chicken, Roasted Duck, Roasted Pork; Nyonya food like all the kuehs; Malay food such as Laksa; chocolate fondue, different flavours of sherbet, chendol and fruit such as Honey Pineapple, Red and Yellow Watermelon, Papaya, Honey Dew, Jackfruit, Guava and Strawberry are also available. The list goes on and on. There are a few themes for lunch/dinner such as international buffet, crab buffet, seafood buffet and seafood-cum-BBQ buffet. On Sundays, the restaurant serves Brunch. For tourists who want to try high quality popular local food of Singapore in a restaurant with good ambience, river view and superb service may want to consider the buffet meal at this restaurant. Lunch is at S$54++ (nett price is about S$62). Dinner is from S$54++ to S$89++. Singaporeans who have not patronized this restaurant may want to check it out too.

If a noisy crowded scene doesn't appeal in the Boat Quay Area, a much better option is to dine in the Fullerton Town Restaurant with a superb view of the River. A reasonable buffet is in the offering and a special price can include as much beer as one can enjoy, if the expense of indulging in wine is not within the budget
5
It is difficult not to get excited about Sunday brunch here.Aside from the normal exemplary service that one gets at the Hotel...it is extended at The Town restaurant for the traditional Singaporian sunday bruchThe staff are boyond nice .. Azman never fails to rememebr you and add that little extra when we go.The food is in abundance and pretty much faultless ....Free flow champagne is the extra cherry on the cake.Seafood is their speciality ...fresh and varied ..Huge choice of other dishes from all types of meats ...curries ...vegetable and a great cheese selection to finish it off.Great ambience that suits everyone ... a perfect way to spend a SundayIt is not a suggestion...it is a must !!

On my third visit to Singapore, one of the key reasons for booking a room at the Fullerton Hotel was my recollection of an amazing buffet breakfast spread at the Town Restaurant. And sure enough, the restaurant did not disappoint on this visit either. The buffet breakfast has the standard array of offerings that you would expect at any international breakfast: eggs, bread, pastries, fruit, drinks (e.g. juice, coffee, tea), cereal, and then some. Additionally there are Asian foods (such as Japanese and Indian cuisine) which to a Westerner may seem out of place. The food is generally good quality, particularly for a buffet breakfast. Fresh fruit is periodically added. Chefs will cook omelettes to one's specifications. Service was generally good from the hostess to the servers (whose primary role is to serve coffee/tea and to clear dishes), but for the most part, as with any buffet, this is a self-service endeavor.There were a couple of things I missed. On my previous visit (admittedly years ago), the buffet had included Chinese buns (e.g. red bean buns, lotus paste buns), but those were not part of the spread on this visit. On our first day, we enjoyed slices of passion fruit, but they were nowhere to be found on the next four mornings. No bananas were included in the fruit offerings - which seemed like an odd omission. But this is all nitpicking considering the quantity and range of offerings that were available to us.Two caveats on my review: first, breakfast was included in my room rate. My understanding is that paying separately for breakfast does require an organ donation to cover its cost, so if you are on a budget, there are undoubtedly less expensive options outside the hotel. However, the buffet is a hearty offering that will carry you well into a light lunch and beyond. Second, we only visited the Town for breakfast. The restaurant has lunch and dinner offerings, but I do not have experience with either

even though they serve mainly great fish and seafood choices, you can still find nice food when you do not eat fish or meat, as i do.the atmosphere is a bit business like for lunch, which is to be expected with all the big banks around. but as a tourist you still feel very special and with the great few of the river it is a wonderful choice for lunch. my husband enjoyed the extensive seafood spread and i went to the desert area three times! all the food is very fresh, good tasting for a buffet and the variety is well thought out. they have a good international wine selection. you do not feel rushed, so you can take your time and really go for the whole special buffet experience

We are on a trip to Oz but decided to spend time In beautiful Singapore on the way over. I have had the pleasure of the buffet before but our friends had not.They were in awe ! From the free flowing champers to the rediculous dessert station this is an event which if you are in Sing and can afford it you can be part of history ,and a feast which you will never forget. You will have read what's available and it's all here for sure.. You will also receive ten out of ten service to boot. Amazing ! I,m reading the sushis not the best and the dim sums not the best but that's not really it .. It's being here .. All of the food stations are of superb quality and if you care to add it all up its a once in a lifetime experience. Trust me. Come and be part of it

One year after my previous review, the Fullerton's international buffet at the Town Restaurant remains first rate. From Japanese to Chinese, western and Indian foods to a cornucopia of desserts, diners have numerous choices and the option of sitting indoors or outside by the beautiful Singapore River. Surprisingly, it is also an absolute bargain at S$ 54 ++ --a sum easily spent at any average Italian restaurant for a skimpy appetizer and a pasta entree. The wine list is very varied but starts at around S$90.00. Still, in Singapore this is practically the rule for upscale restaurants

I just adore the Fullerton hotel and I love the Post Bar and the dim sum weekend buffet at the Jade restaurant. Sadly, none of the other restaurants that I have eaten in measure up. This visit, we had a midweek dinner with friends at the Town. They had booked an outside table and we had a great view of the river and the skyline by night; sadly, the view was the highlight of the evening. I ordered fish and chips, which the Post Bar does really well, but this dish was disappointing. The chips were delicious, but the fish was wet inside and the batter lacked proper crispiness. Service was OK, but no more. I really want to shake whoever manages this restaurant! They have the perfect franchise, an amazing venue and yet they fall so far short of the excellence that should be their goal. Come on, guys, you should be better than this. It's not cheap to eat here, so make your patrons feel that they have spent their money well

Had a great New Year's Day brunch with the family. Excellent friendly service. Amazing variety of food to choose from and all beautifully displayed. Some great new additions since we last visited. Fantastic.
4
Great selection of food, especially the sushi and fresh seafood bars. Free flow champagne is lovely and staff are very attentive. The band also provides good entertainment and makes it a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
4
Super location, great food and atmosphere! Ask for place outside at riverside. Many choices: local SE Asian dishes and Western food. Leave some space for all the nice desserts at the buffet! Only minor remark: do not take dim sum, as it was very dry.

I love my buffets (my waistline shows it!!) and the Fullerton can definitely be ranked along the best out there. For sheer variety this is one of the best in Singapore. They have all the favourites - cold seafood, sushi, Indian, grill, Oriental etc etc ... and of course a wonderful desert selection. On this evening they were also serve lobster --- the only real problem with it was that you had to order it when you wanted to eat it which meant that you had to wait around a bit before it arrived. A bit frustrating when you are eating a buffet.The other minor complaint was that the chendol really didn't taste like chendol at all --- it was like they wanted to make it healthy and remove the coconut --- chendol without coconut? That's a bit like having curry without any spices... strange.Also, it is not clear that there are two options - the seafood and the grill --- if you select seafood you aren't allowed the grill, if you go for grill you can have seafood and grill.... why not just have one?Anyway, the service was good, the food was excellent. Would we come back? Yes

i am living in singapore since 3 years and never had the chance or time to visit the fullerton hotel for a meal yet.so me and my friends decided to try the town restaurant.when we arrived we got a very warm welcome of the hostess at the entrance of the restaurant and were asked to sit inside or outside.we decided to seat outside next to the river.we order a pizza to share to start,2 steaks,lamb rack and a lobster as the main and a bottle of chablis.the pizza was actually quite good.the main courses came not together.the lobster took 15 minutes longer we were told by the waitress when she served the steaks.i ordered rare and got well done and same to lamb.the wine took arround 30 minutes,we were almost finished with our meal.i had to ask 3 times to get a steak knife.and i took ages for the bill in a almost empty restaurant.i was really disappointed about the service in such a famous place and paying 400$.maybe it was just a bad day.i will go back to give a second chance
4
I just went for international buffet in this restaurant on 30 Dec 2013 with my colleagues. We have year end dinner there .The cooked foods not bad, sashimi is good but the oyster very small if compare with other 5 stars hotels.Overall is not bad.its a nice place for gathering And the price is not resonable
5
I have eaten at most of the Sunday Brunches in Singapore: Four Seasons, Shangri La, Raffles, and of course the Ritz Carlton.. so when I came to the Fullerton for brunch, I was a touch apprehensive as I felt nothing could really impress me.But once you enter Town Restaurant, you KNOW this is THE best.. food, glorious food.. EVERYWHERE! You pass the raw seafood counter (with fresh oysters being shucked), then come face to face with the central food station and it's glorious Chinese roast meats glass counter, and on every side there is more and more food! In fact there are so many food stations that I nearly missed the Japanese area.. and actually didn't save space for the huge dessert counter!Yet it's not just about quantity here.. the food is also of high quality. From the freshly tandoored Indian nan breads to the roasts to the foie gras.. everything is cooked to perfection! And most importantly... the Champagne is free flowing Perrier Jouet.. prettily served in original PJ glasses (see my photo). Service is also attentive and polite. Oh, and there's live music from a talented duo who walk around all the tables serenading away your Saturday night hangover....All in all, this is THE best Sunday brunch in Singapore. Trust me as I have done them all (Ritz used to be the best but hasn't evolved for years)!! It's not cheap but it's worth it! I don't understand all the other Sunday brunches which charge pretty much the same but don't even have live music (take note Shangri La and W Hotel in Sentosa!).. Sundays are about great food, plentiful champers.. and sweet music.....

I have a lunch buffet at town restaurant during Dec. I found the food is of great variety. It's a truly international buffet. But most annoying me is that the manager ask me to pay the bills before I go to washroom. It's kinda of impolite I guess. Maybe that's the culture of Singapore?!. Anyway, the food is great and the view of singapore river make me relaxing. I will come back again next time
4
My partner and I decided to come here in celebration of our 1 yr anniversary as I am a huge fan of buffets.The variety of food was quite extensive. However, it cannot be compared to the variety Shangri La offers. Sashimi are relatively fresh if you're a fan. One thing we noticed is that the service rendered was excellent. They clear our plates immediately after we are done, topping up of our water was not delayed too
5
After being treated shabbily at the Raffles Hotel (see review) we contacted the Fullerton for replacement Sunday Brunch plans. We are glad we did. The Town had perhaps the most varied and sumptuous brunch spreads I have seen: huge carving station, huge seafood bar, endless cheese varieties, Asian options, and so on. All the food was very well prepared and the very friendly staff kept our glasses filled with champagne (actual Perrier-Jouet, not the cheap cava or whatnot featured at the usual "champagne" brunch). The desserts were simply astonishing.This was not bargain priced at S $364 for two but was worth every penny. My one suggestion would be enforcement of a dress code as some of our fellow diners were dressed ... Unfortunately (And yes I mean you, fat loud ugly Australian woman in short shorts who constantly talked with your mouth full and chewed with your mouth open). Still, the few slobs really do not detract from a brunch experience that really was first rate
5
Went there to celebrate birthday of one of our family members. Enjoyed the fresh seafood section including fresh oysters. Also enjoyed the local food section, and Indian food section. Beautiful river view and nice and fresh dishes made our birthday party a wonderful one.
5
We stayed at The Fullerton for 3 nights and had breakfast each morning outside by the river. Th food, location and atmosphere are great. The breakfast was a buffet but the food was plentiful and stayed warm. Staff very good, no complaints
5
We sat at an outdoor table overlooking the river. Both my husband and I had the Laksa. It was great and good value but it is the setting that makes it.
5
I had lunch there with my family and my friend's family which my friend had organised. It was fantastic. Great choices of the local cuisine. There was a good selection of food for the kids as well. Great view as well.
1
We are here on deevapali for lunch. When I came in, I thought we were having breakfast. The spread was local cuisine and all the cheap stuff. The quality of food was worse than any hawker food I have taken. The service was poor too. My table was stacked with lots of dirty dishes and nobody cleared them. Very disappointed n will not come again.
5
Very nice mostly Western breakfast, good ala carte menu for lunch. Expensive even for a hotel restaurant of this sort, but you may be able to get a room rate that includes breakfast The upper section can get unpleasantly loud when it's crowded, especially on Sundays when families come for brunch
5
has to be THE best buffet i have ever had - never ending champers and what a choice of food - seafood (oysters, lobster, prawns, scallops) Italian (pasta/pizza) Japanese (sushi, sashimi) all day breakfast, carvery, indian, cheeses. Then theres is the desert selection. Go there on a very empty stomach - and eat slowly. You will need a very slow walk along the riverbank at the end
5
Came here for a breakfast meeting as the location is excellent, there is a great buffet and the seating can be outside or inside. Service was patchy and they seem less familiar with coping with non resident breakfast bookings, but I would still recommend it as a great venue
5
This restaurant is centrally located and quite convenient. I really liked the lobby connecting to this place giving you a very relaxed feel to enjoy your cup of tea with friends.From Inside the restaurant you have a nice view.food was excellent and buffet served has lot of variety from seafood, Indian , English and salads. I almost tried my hands on everything and saving some space for dessert.
5
Buffet dinner priced at 69++, with additional seafood bbq at 89++, beer and juice included in price.Quality of food may not match shangrila or grand copthorne waterfront BUT the service is FIRST CLASS!We went for dinner at 6.30pm and explained that we had to rush off to watch the fireworks at 8pm but worry that we may not even have time for dessert. One of the staff, Julius assured us that we can return to the restaurant after fireworks and can finish our buffet until 10.30pm. Oh well, of course we did not abuse it! We came back for dessert at 9.20pm and left at 9.45pm after we were satisfied with our finale desserts.Service staff are driven to provide excellent service in this hotel and I am positive they have done an excellent job! Kudos to you folks for creating a very memorable dinner for us
5
... but with freeflowing Champagne be aware that your hosts won't be offended if you don't quaff your glass empty as they continuously fill it up...
Great selection of seafood, standard Sunday roast fayre, well-hidden Caviar....
I recommend sitting outside
5
If you're ever in Singapore and like to have a good quality seafood buffet, don't hesitate go to the Fullerton hotel,
Good value, wonderfully staff and good seafood.
5
I have become a regular at the Fullerton's Town Restaurant primarily because of 3 things: 1) great location on the Singapore River with lovely outdoor seating, 2) Outstanding Service, particularly when Azmah is running things and 3) fantastic food either a la carte or buffet.
3
Dined at Town Restaurant at Fullerton Hotel on a business meeting in Singapore, and had a nice standard meal. The food we had was good but needed a bit more flavor and looked like they were more concerned about portion size than quality. The salmon was cooked very beautifully and the bread selection vas very nice. A good meal, but not the Fullerton class i had hoped for
2
After many visits for Sunday Brunch, yesterday's will be our last. We spent more than SGD$1,000 for the seven of us, only to be seated between two tables of families with extremely noisy, rude, and unruly children. Their numbskull parents were completely oblivious. The food and service were excellent as always, but the ambiance was a complete disaster. When I complained to Mr. Nedumpurath (Assistant Manager), he offered a weak apology and his business card. If the hotel expects to attract those of us without young children, then they should seat us outside of earshot of the rug rats. Too bad Chuck E. Cheese doesn't have a Singapore branch. It would be a goldmine
5
Town Restaurant is one of the five restaurant of the Fullerton Hotel. It's an all-day dining restaurant, and is ideal for a power breakfast, business lunch or idyllic buffet dinner whilst enjoying views of the Singapore River. It proposed an international cuisine. You could either choose "à la carte" or the buffet. On Sundays, a brunch take place.The service is attentive and friendly. The terrace and the view on the river is idyllic. As, dishes, I tried the beef burger with bacon and cheese, served with salads, french fries, tomato and barbecue sauce. Perfect cooking and nicely presented.In addition, if your staying at hotel, you have 30% reduction even prices are not expensive compare to other restaurants in the city
5
I have "brunched" at several hotels in Singapore including the shangri-la, the Hyatt, the Marriott and the four seasons an whilst all are great the Fullerton beats them all, massive variety, often 3 toes of oyster freshly shucked, lobsters etc, plus Indian, sushi, dim-sum etc etc fantastic, all washed down with Moët and I challenge you to try and empty your glass!!! Plus margarita's Bloody Mary's and other drinks free flow.. A little expensive at about 200 sing dollars all in ( taxes etc) but in actual fact for 3 and a half hours of fine champagne and excellent food you cannot go wrong!!

We had a large group of 22 booked for Sunday brunch to celebrate 2 people's birthdays. Service was the best I have seen at a brunch in Singapore for the following reasons:1.When we turned up, the tables were nicely arranged, but the split wasn't quite right for the group, so we asked for a couple of changes. These were attended to without any problem and was quickly resolved.2. One of the settings was for a 2 yr old - this was done with the high chair in place and plastic cutlery3. Another child turned up unexpectedly and the staff quickly arranged another high chair4. Both children were given cuddly toys by the staff5. The birthdays were celebrated by the band playing at the table and the delivery of two cakes; one for each birthday6. Paying the bill - where there is a large group and splitting can be problematic, this was no issue 7. A follow up email was sent to the person who made the booking, just reinforcing the customer service focusWhile I think there may be better food and beverage offerings for Champagne brunch available, the service we received at the Fullerton will encourage us to book there again. Well done

A lot of restaurants have one thing in common: unobservant staff....and Town is no exception. My partner and I stood at the hostess stand for awhile until I approached one team member to ask for a table for two.We were seated at a table on the upper deck, overlooking the lower deck and the buffet spread. An international and seafood buffet seemed to be the highlight. We chose to go with the ala carte menu and picked out the laksa and hor fun with a pizza to share.My partner liked the laksa (spicy noodle dish popular in Malaysia and Singapore) served in a fairly huge bowl with generous servings of yellow noodles, fish ball, quail eggs, medium-sized prawns and fish cake slices. Otah (spicy fish paste) was served as a side. The prawns could have been de- shelled though, for it can be messy trying to do it by yourself. For me, it takes the fun out of eating prawns; but my partner did not mind. The hor fun (thick flat rice noodles) came with either beef or seafood. I asked if the kitchen could replace them with fish slices, and they obliged. It was a little underwhelming as the serving was small compared to the laksa, and so I was a little disappointed. Although the fish slices was fresh and thick, the dish could do with a larger serving of noodles. It had the right quantity of corn-starched sauce so that the dish was not too dry but the noodles tasted slightly overcooked to the point of being burnt. It ruined the taste of the dish somewhat. The marguerita pizza we shared was simple yet delicious, and large enough to make up for my main dish. Dessert was premium ice-cream and it proved to be an excellent close to our dinner. It was refreshing yet light with blueberries and black raspberries thrown in. In short, yummy!The service staff on the other hand, as an extension of my first line at the beginning of this review, could have been more attentive. We had uncleared plates and unrefilled cups of water on our table, despite the fact that a few team members walked past our table numerous times on the way into the kitchen; which was where our table was located. Strategic yet overlooked so often.Having said that, the gentleman in a black suit made sure we were comfortable and satisfied throughout our dinner by checking up on us periodically. And that is what I call service attention
5
Went over with my tertiary classmates for weekday dinner. Was surprised to find the restuarant quite empty, and it worries me abit. However, when we sat down, the food was a good spread! Sashimi has a good spread and fresh. Seafood are also fresh. Not forgetting the dessert, my friend which is a sweet eater, she enjoyed it very much! The staffs also cleared our dirty plates fast enough, maybe because the restuarant is quite empty. But I do appreciate the fast replies from Miss Ashirin whenever I email them in regarding of my reservation. Thumbs up!
5
Huge choice of foods and excellent free flow champagne in a historic building in a wonderful location right beside the river.
5
The spread of food is nice. Good service. TWG Tea and variety of coffee included. Nice ambience. Will definitely return. Much more enjoyable than the other more popular buffet at the Shang.
4
We (4 adults and 2 children) had a birthday buffet (for me) on a Sunday evening. Such beautiful hotel and great location. We decided to eat on the terrace (which was a bit hot but our choice). The selection of food is great: fish, suchi, pasta, pizza, salads, lots of traditional Singaporean food, cheese/buscuits, fabulous deserts etc etc. Also they provided a cake for my birthday with a candle - lovely touch. Cant fault it really - very memorable
4
This is the place to go, from Mother's Day celebrations to conference meetings. I brought my mother there for Mother's Day, they were very accommodating, the food was delicious and it was in the beautiful Fullerton Hotel. It was a buffet with amazing, fresh seafood (best you'll find in Singapore!) there was also Japanese, Indian and Chinese food. The salad bar was great and. I recommend the bean salad. The dessert was splendid! The brownie was my favorite, soft sweet gooey chocolate, t's amazing. There was live entertainment of music which was very nice
3
My mom and my husband came here for dinner, whilst I went for bible study last Friday night. As my husband is a big fan of seafood, he not only ate lobsters, but also those with shells, such as clams etc. However, he ended up with diahorrea for the next few days. Other than that, the food in the restaurant is generally very nice and fresh
5
As a present, we were treated to Champagne Brunch at the Town Restaurant in the Fullerton Hotel, Singapore. Without a doubt, it was worth doing. The champagne was free-flowing, staff attentive at ensuring your glass was constantly topped up and the food was excellent. Highlights include:- Champagne (obviously)- Roast Lamb (best I've had in Singapore to date)- Desert selection was spectacular- Cheese selection was impressive (approx 30-35 different cheeses on offer).It was so good, we are looking at going again in the next 2 weeks. I would recommend this experience to anyone who likes good food, champagne and a great atmosphere. Going as a couple was fun, but I believe it would be even more enjoyable going as a group of people. Price is $155++ and worth every penny (in my opinion)
5
This is a great place to treat guests to a very representative Asian buffet. The Fullerton boasts lovely halls, terrific architecture, rich history and truly delicious food. One must definitely visit this place to get a sense of how 'empire' saw itself in Singapore. And how harmonious it seems to have developed since. The view of the river is enchanting as well
5
This restaurant is simply the best in Singapore for me....The buffet is well organised and a wide variety of choices....the fish Buffet is awesome and the international buffet is good too.I have been here for breakfast and it is faultless but the one thing that this place is head and shoulders above all the rest is SERVICE!!!! The staff here are so far ahead of the rest of the field.....attentive, professional and human...not like your average robot in other places!
4
I've been to the Town restaurant twice over the last few weeks, both for business meetings.The first time was for the lunch buffet. Service was good, buffet spread was 4/5, selection was good but not incredible, quality was good to excellent. The fact that they had oysters was nice.The second time went for an a-la-carte dinner, they also have a dinner buffet but we elected to go a-la-carte. Had the lamb chops with fries and the corn and egg soup. Soup was excellent, fries crispy, lamb disappointed (main course, $50), far too small with a poor meat/fat ratio. The other issue is that service is not up to par, likely because they are used to people self-serving at the buffet (most people will go for the buffet).Overall the ambiance pushes this up to a 4/5, and tables are spaced such that you have sufficient privacy. Good place for a business lunch/dinner
5
Wonderful vibrant atmosphere with an extensive buffet for all tastes. There are 4 main food stations ranging from fresh imaginative salads and cold seafood to sushi and then Asian dishes from Malaysia, Thailand, India and local cuisine. The outlook to the river is relaxing. Take your time. It is a little expensive but worth it
4
Good food and nice service. It was a nice respite from the heat and we really enjoyed people watching as we ate.
5
Wide variety of delicious food and authentic local food can be found in this restuarant. Waiters were very attentive and service was excellent.
5
Last Sunday our guests from Australia took us to the buffet lunch at the Fullerton Hotel. OMG... Just absolutely the best buffet ever. Free flow MoÃ«t champagne, lobsters by fine dozens, oysters, beautiful salads, and a gorgeous dessert buffet. Service staff were brilliant and could not be faulted. Only one complaint... I didn't want to leave
3
I went to the Town Restaurant, here in Fullerton Hotel, many many times. Never get bored. I came with family and friends, with lovely view and nice ambience, the whole evening makesnit even facinated. I found the staff, were nice and helpful. The only thing I feel a bit sad, was the food. Perhaps I got somewhere else to compare. So, the whole thing, I would say, just come here in the evening, had nice coffee and some dessert, have a good chat, smoke, and enjoy. I will come back again
4
Reasonable price for buffet dinner in such good atmosphere for our pre-reunion dinner. We have our Lou-hei here and hope to have a joyful and prosperous year.But the quality of the food and were detoriated. Attentive and details service could have better. The seafood selection was not expected.We love this colonial building very much
4
The options available for the dinner were so extensive, we did not notice two stations up the top. Grab a table near the window and people watch the walkway from Clarke Quay. This is also where the smokers sit, so stay inside if you do not smoke.The only negative (besides not trying a little bit of everything) was some of the hot food was mildly warm, however the flavours were great and well worth it.Good value for money
5
There are a variety of choices for Sunday brunch/lunch in Singapore and if you are looking for something a little more stylish and with free flow French bubbles, Town at the Fullerton has to be the number one choice.  The food quality and selection is fantastic, great seafood - lobster, crayfish, prawns and oysters, a sushi bar and the hot meals includes standard roasts, a good selection of Asian dishes and a good selection of Indian dishes, literally something for all tastes.The service is great, and what you would expect for a 5 star hotel. You may occasionally need to wave down a waiter as it gets busy and definitely book in advance, there are never any free tables.If you get a choice get a table by the window on the river
4
Took my wife there for our wedding anniversary - we got given the best table in the restaurant with a fantastic view of Marina Bay - spectacular. Food was good not great - my wife had to send her scallops back as they were over cooked, quantity of food though was very good. Service was very good. Overall it was a very good experience and we would go back again when we have saved up - it was expensive
5
We had dinner there the night we arrived, menu selection was ok with a mix of Western and Asian entrees. Food came quickly and service was efficient.We had the breakfast buffet at Town every morning we stayed there and it was EXCELLENT! Great selection of Western, Chinese, Japanese, Indian food as well as fresh fruits. I would definitely go back for the breakfast here
4
We had the buffet here with friends. Something for everybody here. Not cheap at S$70 pp so come very hungry. Great selection and all the choices were fresh and well prepared. Choices include: pasta to order, salads and seafood, sushi and sashimi, Indian curries, Malay dishes, western flavours and delicious desserts (personal favourite was the chocolate fondue fountain). Excellent location in the Fullerton Hotel lobby
5
everything was great . The freshness , service ,quality , variety, great eggs . could have stayed all day and night and enjoyed the wines .
4
Nice restaurant, a little pricey, but offers nice waterside tables, beside the quays.Bum boat stop, at the restaurant, so very convenient for diners or hotel guests.
2
Place is so noisy, and during weekends, food trays are empty and have to wait 10min for a chef at buffet to cook a bowl of noodles. Wld be faster and cheaper to eat in foodcourt
5
Excellent Singaporean specialities served in this restaurant at decent prices. Even simple plates like laksa soups are well done, fresh and just excellent. Very sympathic service and super efficient for the businessman who has not too much time to waste for a quick lunch.
4
We sat facing the singapore river ... The spread was good with the discount we paid from using HSBC infinity card... Otherwise we would not attend it as it was beyond our budget .. But with the voucher it was great value ,,at ponder was heart .. I went with my mom , mom in law sister in law son and my wife .. The waiter and the manager were very accommodating,... The weather was great for outdoors. When we were there some one was getting married and we sat next to the couple solemnsatiom table
5
The position is excellent. The terrace on the Singapore River, between Cavanagh & Anderson Bridges us prime. The food is simply well done, from A la Carte, to Excellent Buffet. It is simply reliable and good with a wonderf ambience, inside, or out on the terrace
5
What better to pass the time on a Sunday afternoon then three hours of eating your favourite food and drinking unlimited Moët and Margaritas.Excellent friendly service, well stocked food stations and all set in the beautiful and historical Fullerton hotel. Plenty to choose from but our particular favourites were:1. The Sushi/Sashimi Bar2. The seafood3. The Chinese Dumplings4. The Roast meats5 The risotto served from a wheel of cheese6. The pan seared Foie gras and Scallops7. The extensive choice of cakes, sweets, icecream, tarts, amazing!We couldn't eat for the rest of the day
4
We went for our first visit inside the Fullerton with some work colleagues. The ladies had booked to have the all you can eat chocolate buffet and we wanted to eat 'normal food' but still be on the same table. At first this seemed to test the rules of the hotel but in the end they found a table where we could access both buffets. The Town Restaurant had a good selection of different types of food in several locations across he restaurant. There were salads, sushi, seafood, pasta, laksa, range of hot dishes, desserts and cheese. All were excellent and for the money reasonably good value - the sushi was really fresh, good quality plump oysters and even half lobsters. The fresh prepared laksa was the highlight for me although it was very filling (not good when you have so much to try!).As is usual in high end hotels he drinks were expensive as we struggled to get a bottle of wine below £50. Overall a nice evening - and the ladies enjoyed the chocolate buffet too
4
Took guests to the buffet evening brunch, as you can sit outside a chill and graze on the quays. The buffet had 2 options 68/88 Inc slings and tiger. In hindsight we should have gone for the 68 and ordered wine, drinks etc separately. The 68 buffet was more than enough and the food was excellent would recommend getting there for the early as understandably the later it gets the less inclined they will refill dishes. Just having the two drink options was a bit much after an hour or so
5
It was past noon on a Sunday. I wanted to have Singapore Laksa as I always do but was informed that only Buffet Brunch was served on Sunday. The seafood spread was excellent, a wide variety, and fresh. Accompany that with the free flowing moet, excellent service and a superb setting. It would be difficult to go wrong. Off course there were the local fares, the Sunday cuts and the desserts to satisfy the Sunday crowd. It was the last Sunday of the month and the Restaurant was running full house, so it would be best to make reservation.As a cheese lover, the spread, I must say was impressive. It was a good way to spend a Sunday in Singapore. There was no better way to end it but with a Cohiba at the best smoking spot in Singapore, watching the junks sailing by. The above minus the Cohiba will cost you SGD 150.00. Savor the good life, you are in South East Asia
3
The food was good esp the Miso Cod and the Pan-Seared Salmon but the service is poor. Took us quite an effort to get the serving staff to come by our table most of the time.
4
I have eaten there for last 2 nights. On business therefore cost less if an issue than quality and the fact I returned was because I personally love Sushi and local dishes like Satay, noodles and Lakshi (sp?). Whilst the restaurant in typical buffet fashion served a whole variety of western and Asian cuisine, they have a Japanese and local station where I could order freshly prepared food that I love. There were a wide variety of deserts that I avoided but appeared popular. I liked the continually filled iced water and good tea at the end of the meal. Could not fault the service. I was asked what I liked on first day and shown exactly what the options were. Not pushy, would recommend, especially if staying in hotel, (rather than as a specific destination).
4
Went to the restaurant several times, and everytime was great! Great food (international buffet dinner), beautiful view, and the ambience is great too... Although the buffet dinner was abit pricey, but it was worth it. One downside though, we were seated at this table which was very near to one of the columns, hence the seating was very cramped! More thought should be placed on the spacings in between tables, so that diners will have more privacy and comfort.Overall, i like my visits to this restaurant, and definitely will be back again! ^_

I was born Indian in a previous life and my body remembers this and always craves for good Indian food. This weekend it good a full dose at the Town restaurant at the Fullerton Hotel.I have eaten brilliant Indian food at some Taj hotels in the past and when I saw that the friendly folks from the Fullerton hotel brought some Chefs out I knew that this was an opportunity not to be missed. Although the coffee shop's regular buffet items are still available the nicely arranged Indian buffet was in the center both from a taste sensation and from a selection perspective. Absolute deliciousness. Outside they had a tandoor (charcoal fired) to make fresh nan and inside you got a chance to meet with the Taj chef who happens to come from the Taj Delhi and who is happy to explain the dishes to you.There is also a very nice display of Taj Marsala Art - something that explains the different spices used and mixtures for the various dishes.Fullerton services was swift and friendly as always and pricing is reasonable for the quality and choice offered.If you like Indian food, don't go past this one

First Sumday brunch here for over seven years but it hasn't changed a great deal. Lots of different food stations all hosting a range of quality foods. For shellfish lovers there are lobsters, oysters etc, for meat lovers several different joints, and a very wide range of other dishes.The service is impeccable and the surroundings elegant. We ate and drank our fill and left very satisfied.Only gripe is that when last here the champers was Veuve Cliqot, it's now MoÃ«t which seems a bit tight given that this is an expensive treat. This definitely loses them a star. But it was overall extremely good, just as I remembered.

Been here a few times before and very impressed, but after last Sunday I won't be back. On shown to our table it revealed a seat that had very worn and cracked upholstery. Beer was an extra cost. The scrambled egg was made in advance and possibly the worst egg I have tasted. When I asked for a fried egg they had to bring out a portable gas cooker! There was no soup to accompany the chicken or duck rice and the duck was as tough as old boots

We try to avoid eating at hotels when we travel, but wow, this was an amazing breakfast. They had every ethnic cuisine represented and it was some of the best food we had in Singapore. Best item: Roti Prata - hand thrown tortilla like bread with Curry items on top. YUM.

We went to Town on a Sunday morning to meet friends staying at the Fullerton. It's in a very nice location, with a view out to the river from some tables, and staff were helpful and efficient.Food is a bit of a mixed bag; on the one hand it's the only place I've found wholemeal croissants, but on the other the hash browns weren't brilliant. Perhaps they'd been waiting too long, because freshly cooked things like the omelettes were done perfectly.Coffee is only so-so; it's bizarre that every hotel in the world seems to serve the same over-strong, unhappy tasting muck, but perhaps busy businessmen need horrible coffee to make them go to work, and the Fullerton hasn't realised that isn't necessary for the weekends.Overall, nice if you're tactical about what food you choose; this is priced such that you should save it for special treats, not everyday dining

I was surprised by the quality of food and service at Town Restaurant buffet given the price of S$54 per pax. We had a lovely dinner. The food quality is very good and service is good too. Super value for money! And the place is impressive too -- Fullerton Hotel

Whenever I wanted a foreign visitor to get a feel of the colonial past while having a meal or a drink, I brought them to Fullerton Hotel. It used to the General Post Office with it's imposing columns and solid granite floors and airy reception halls. So when I went with an American businessman who is visiting first time to Singapore to have breakfast in the Town Cafe, I was quite disappointed when it was no better than some 3 star tourist bus destinations. Management must have decided to conserve energy because the air was stale with aromas with oily food and human odors. What used to be a very elegant place was filled with people that were not properly attired (eg slippers). The various stations were situated in a random manner with the usual juices, cereals and fruits in tables that were different parts of the room. The selection of fruits was inadequate for a hotel of this rank ( compared with say the Greenhouse in Ritz Carlton). The breakfast coffee does not have any aroma and quite acidic. I had to apologize to my business visitor that this was way below what I used to experience at this place.

We always come here for our bday celebration as the buffet has excellent choice of seafood and dessert - the best seats for dinner are the outdoor area as you can enjoy the view of Boat Quay from a distance
4
I really liked the great steak's and fishes. However the rest of the seafood was a dissapointment and the prices were expensive.

A lovely restaurant where you have the opportunity to sit on the terrace overlooking the river. food pretty good though the freshness of the juices and lack of variety was a bit disappointing. staff lovely and helpful.

The Fullerton Town Restaurant has the best Sunday Champagne Brunch in Singapore. We especially like the outdoor seating by the river. Book early because there are not many tables outside, but most other Champagne brunches in Singapore don't have any outdoor seating. The wait staff fills your glass with free flow champagne often - we've never sat with an empty glass or needed to flag down the staff for a refill. You can also get margaritas and other mixed drinks included. Enjoy the wide buffet selection including fresh seafood, western breakfast (eggs benedict are a favorite of ours), roasts and western hot dishes, indian, chinese, japanese sushi, pizza pasta, and many others. Top it off with a good desert selection

My family has accompanied me on several occasions to the Town Restaurant in the historic Fullerton Hotel. This stately neo-classical structure was once housed the Singapore Post Office (and several other government offices), and features a gorgeous atrium courtyard.We have visited on holidays, and Sunday brunches, always when their splendid buffet was available, at a cost ranging from $65 to $95 per adult diner. Even the smaller of these prices is pretty stiff--until one factors in the quality and breadth of fare offered. The dizzying variety of fresh chilled seafood routinely available during the Sunday brunch (unlimited lobster tails & claws, crab legs, prawns, crawfish, scallops, mussels, smoked salmon (nova lox), poached salmon, and several types of oysters), for example, exceeds anything I've witnessed, at any price, anywhere on the planet.Add to this an array of hot dishes--typically, items like standing rib of beef, pork lion, grilled salmon, lamb chops, beef medallions, and a few regional chicken and fish dishes--and sides, soups, salads, breads, cheeses (also in bewildering variety), a full sushi display (sashimi, mat rolls, hand rolls, etc.), and a pasta station (offering cooked-to-order service). Finally, the finest and fullest assembly of desserts await you at the meal's climax (double entendre intended!), frequently including a chocolate fountain, parfaits, fresh fruits, puddings, pastries, ice creams, pies, candies (often in the form of edible utensils), and crème brûlée--to mention but a few.We have never yet been disappointed, save by our own limited capacity to sample the full garden of delights

Town in Fullerton Hotel, Singapore is a marvelous place to have a meal and chill out. The dinner buffet spread is fantastic for a reasonable price of $68+++. And this month, there are credit cards offer. The service is faultless. Everyone is alert and goes quickly to help the patrons there. A captain helped my mom, taking her plate and assisted her down the stairs back to the table. The swift clearing of empty plates on the table and topping up of water were immediate. Top notch service, for sure.If you have not visited that place, you must. It's got good spread and good service with pleasant ambiance

Having done brunch at the Shangri La and the Four Seasons both of which we liked we decided to try the Fullerton. We felt the Fullerton just edged them both. Better selection better service and better setting better value and defiantly free flowing. Our glasses never got below half full before being topped up

I had a good experience this past week meeting clients at the Fullerton Town Restaurant for breakfast -- in fact 3 times. The buffet menu is large and of rather high quality, featuring both Asian and Western foods. My only complaint is that they set all breads and pastries on a second level, and one toaster is meant to serve all. Also, they have the tiniest of glasses for juices, requiring one to fill up three. The service has improved a lot, and at one point I had to ask the waiter to stop refilling my coffee cup each time I took a sip. This is a vast improvement from a bad experience I had there a year ago. Good job Mr Manager

After enjoying the Sunday Vintage Champagne Brunch at the Ritz Carlton 3 times in the past 2 years, I thought that I'd try something different during my next trip to Singapore and after searching through a number of reviews I decided to try out The Fullerton Sunday brunch, but I left after around one hour quite disappointed with my choice.In fairness, however, had I not first experienced The Ritz Carlton, I would most likely have been reasonably satisfied with the offerings at The Fullerton with some reservations about the price I paid and the quality of the fare I was served.Notes I made on the day are as follows:- My first menu selection was Eggs Benedict, that I took from the servery around 5 minutes after the brunch started. While the item was cooked perfectly and presented well, both the egg and the accompanying sauce were stone cold.- Ditto the roast lamb and roast beef. I was the first diner to take some of each of these meats (carved in front of me from the joint) and despite being under the warming lights, both were only lukewarm, and were tough and dry- I then had some lobster, that is served cooked, on the half shell and sitting on ice. I am quite particular with seafood, and noted that the lobsters were at room temperature when I went to eat them straight after being selected. Where had they been prior to being placed on the ice?- I very much enjoyed the selection from the sushi / sashimi area and also enjoyed the fried foie gras with accompanying cooked apple- The champagne served at The Fullerton is the "standard" Moet, yet the Ritz provides you with "Vintage" Moet. - Having a tiled floor, The Fullerton is quite noisy and due to being fully booked, was quite "busy" and not conducive to a relaxing brunchIn summary, The Fullerton Sunday brunch, whilst adequate, is no match for The Ritz Carlton, where, for the same price, you enjoy a 5 star dining experience and the staff are pushing you (and everyone else) out the door at the end of the day (because you don't want to leave!

Went here for Mother's Day today. This place has gone down hill big time. I felt like I was one step away from eating in a cafeteria or trough. The food was gross, the atmosphere was very shabby and sloppy, the service was terrible. We will never, ever go here again. 150+ pp is definitely not worth the poor experience, food, and service. We will continue to visit the Four Seasons, The Sentosa, and the other hotel brunches

The worst pumpkin soup I ever had. Disgraceful!

The restaurant has a very nice and relaxing terrace, so we did not mind paying SGD$60 for two drinks and a lime juice. I believe we were in a non-smoking section, located next to the smoking section. On the other side of us standing near the door of the restaurant were SEVEN people smoking. It does not matter that you are outside, you're in a cloud of smoke. What I don't understand is that if smoking is not permitted indoors for the sake of other customers, why is it permitted to ruin the terrace experience? This is something easily addressed by finding another smoking location. The drinks were fine but we had to chase down someone to place our order. Fancy prices, not fancy service

Probably one of the best sunday champagne lunches i have ever had.We were seated in the town part but there were people in the courtyard area and people outside. It was packed due to it being grand prix weekend. Service was good even though they were so busy. Fernando was a legend keeping our champagne glasses full. The food was of a high standard. My favourite part was the desserts and the selection of cheeses was out of this world.Couldnt afford to stay here so we splashed out on lunch instead. As I said, it is one of the best I have been to but also the most expensive! Worth it for a treat

The last time I went to this champagne brunch was nearly 2 years ago and my memories of it were of fantastic food, great atmosphere, and a special treat worth the extra cost. Unfortunately that is no longer the case. As one of the more expensive Sunday brunches in Singapore it definitely was a disappointment. The food was not as good as the other options out there and in some cases way below expected standards, for example the beef roast was quite fatty and the seafood selection was small. Service was hit or miss and there was only one bartender on duty so cocktail orders were slow. With the great location and atmosphere I really do wish the food had been better

We booked ourselves and a couple of friends for the champagne brunch on Sunday. Seeing as the French champagne is free flowing, it isn't cheap but it's worth it. There was a table with nothing but oysters, mussels, clams, prawns and lobsters. There was another display with fresh Japanese sashimi, sushi and other delicacies. There were tables with cheeses, salads, roasts, Indian food, sweets and more. The wine, beer and certain cocktail were also included which was good. We were there from 12 to 3:30pm so were did nothing for the rest of the afternoon but rest back at our hotel
5
Where do you start? How about with free flowing Tattinger champagne, your glass topped up constantly for three hours as you graze on the delightful and plentiful food offerings at this fantastic, high class buffet. From rock lobster, to fresh prawns the size of your fist, to sushi, to traditional roasts, to french cheeses, to home-made pasta dishes, to dim-sum, to indian curry, to .... the list goes on and on and on. All of it cooked to perfection and in ready supply. Just one tip: Make sure you save room for the mountain of puddings - everything from creme brulees, to fruit crumbles to petit fours to a chocolate fountain. It's a mammoth eating and drinking session that screams indulgence. Could their be a better way to spend a Sunday
5
The buffet offers a great seafood selection (oysters, super yummy lobsters, scallops, prawns..) and a very wide range of salads. The sushi selection wasn't very attractive, but that's really a minor thing since there is so much to taste at other stations! The turkey is a must, super tender and juicy! They also have a pasta station, where you can choose your type of pasta and have your own sauce/topping made for you on the spot. The dessert station is amazing and offers plenty of choices, from fruits to cakes, with an excellent creme brulee that you must try. If you hate chocolate it'll be a problem, but otherwise, you will enjoy desserts for sure! Ask to be seated outside, by the river, the weather isn't as hot as you would expect and the view is quite nice. One of the best diner buffet I've been to, will go back for sure

In short, this is the best brunch I have been to! As expected the Fullerton service was impeccable, the ambience relaxed and pleasant, we spent 5 hours at the table as the staff did not rush us though the brunch closes at 3:30 pm. I recommend booking well in advance as it is always full to capacity. Though a lot of reviews recommend al fresco or main restuarant seating, I would suggest the Courtyard. It is cosy, fewer people milling about to get into the buffet queue and there is a pleasant band that comes on and plays lovely music that does not interrupt your conversation. Fullerton serves Tattinger Champagne, great house red/white wines, no headaches or sickness post brunch! The menu covered almost all nationalities and we stuffed ourselves. I only mention things that made an impact, their great bread and cheese selection, roast beef, and the Indian butter chicken was awesome, the salad bar was limited but fresh. I am allergic to seafood, but the spread was great and my friends enjoyed every bit of it. The desserts were sumptious, largely chocolate based, but they did serve creme brulee, bread pudding, pecan pies, pineapple crumble and a fruit tart. Please avoid the pasta counter although i read rave reviews, the sauce is made from characterless tomatoes and there is a better mushroom flavor to Ragu or Barilla sauce. The post lunch cappucino was white in colour and dilute, almost all the places in Singapore suffer this, except Borders Cafe at Wheelock Place-it serves one of the best cappucinos. Fullerton is definitely pricey, but the service, atmosphere make up for it, and it has found the correct balance between number of people and food counters so that you never have to wait too long to get your food! A must try!In comparison, brunch at The Terrace, Sentosa has the best dessert selection and Indian food, the view is fantastic and they give complimentary pool access (towels provided). On a clear day, Equinox has a superb view of Singapore from the 69th floor, and their meats were the best but the dessert counter not that great. The service at both places is ok, Fullerton is the best

My partner and I saw the Town restaurant while taking a stroll down the river.It reminded us of our visit to Paris.We just had to experience it.What a disappointment! The view from the terrace was great,but the food and the service wasn't up to standard. Such a pity

My Mother was on holiday, first time ever to Singapore so I took her for a special lunch to the Fullerton. The lady who greeted us was very polite and went through all the different options for the buffet.We decided to sit outside. It was a bit run down for a five star hotel, and bird poo on my chair. When we told the waiter what we would like he was most rude and said not possible, we asked him to get original lady, who said was possible. We then asked for tea, which he told us would be 10 dollars a cup- once again we asked for the lady who said no we could have free flow tea as she had said at the beginning. The same waiter came back and started to argue over the price of the buffet infront of all other diners, I was so cross we said we would not be dining here and walked out.If you want excellent attention, very polite staff and fabulous food go to the Shangri La

Not much variety. But the quality is good

The first time I visited Town restaurant was many years ago when the hotel was newly open. Can't remember what food I ordered except that I was delighted with the desert.Last week I decided to visit this restaurant again for it's dinner buffet (to check on its buffet quality before splurging on its expensive Sunday Brunch). I have to say it was a really unpleasant dinner.Service was very bad (eg the captain or manager cleared away our plates together with the cutleries without replacing a set - and we were only on our first round!), most food trays were more than half empty and they took ages to replenish the empty ones. When the chocolate mousse cake ran out quite early in the night, they were not able to replenish one even when a customer requested for it. They said they were baking a new one, and that turned out to be an inferior chocolate cake. Most other cakes were chiffons - no cream, no fruits, no toppings. In fact, most of their dessert items resemble those that you find in a 3 star hotel.The selection of food is really limited though the quality is slightly above average especially the seafood. The layout of the restaurant is really bad and it doesn't make the food appetising nor make a nice ambience. Due to the design the restaurant felt noisier than it actually was and felt like a four star hotel.If you really have to go, be sure to book a seat outdoors by the river since that is the only redeeming factor.Otherwise I would suggest that you go to Ritz (service for the queen), The Line (best overall), Four Seasons (great Sunday Brunch) or Raffles Hotel (more specialty food and great handmade chocolates). see my other reviews on these hotels' buffet restaurants
