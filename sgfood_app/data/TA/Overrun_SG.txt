At first, was wondering why there are so many people visit the place. The best cendol ice cream with durian (signature) ever. Suitable for hot and humid weather like Singapore.

Not bad ~
You need to wait at least 30 minutes ！
很一般的冰淇淋，可以選很多種料。
但個人覺得普通沒有非常特別，排隊時間要花超過半小時，建議可以把排隊時間拿去嘗試別的⋯

Overrun is extremely unique in a nice way. You may not like everything they have, but it specializes in local flavors and is extremely well done. Their chendol soft serve is out of this world and I don't even like chendol that much! One day after we went, they sold out and closed at 9:30pm when their official closing time on a Saturday is 11pm! I keep wanting to try other things, but always end up deferring to the soft serve. I'm sure their other items are good tool. I also like the fact that they have few choices of flavors and do them well rather than other run-of-the-mill joints that overwhelm you with 20 indifferent flavors

They have recently renovated the place and now also sells pastries, sandwiches and coffee. I had the chendol soft serve and chendol cheesecake.Simply love them ! Worth the calories !!Will try their wraps and sandwiches which look good ! So thankful they have a water dispenser in the shop that allow customers help themselves to cool water while waiting for their orders

Soft ice cream with chendol condiments, got to applaud the initiative and a place that gives u a queue number that says please returned card if u no longer wish to wait. I love chendol but the soft serve blend doesn't work for me, please the huge amount of sugar involved pushes every consumer closer to diabetes!

The outlet was located in the middle of a row of shophouses. It offered Chendol flavoured softserve with a variety of toppings to add on. There was also the weekly special.Standard Chendol (S$6)Soft serve with coconut flakes, pandan jelly strips and gula melaka syrup.The special flavour of the week - Thai Milk Tea wasn't available when I dropped by the shop. So struck with the original. The soft serve melt rather fast. The pandan jelly strips got frozen easily

I heard the hipster of this place that serve the best soft serve ice cream in the kampong glam area. Decided to give it a try since every time when I walked pass the dessert shop, it was always filled with crowds. I tried both of their chendol & durian soft serve. And find it nothing special. The Ice cream melts too fast and is quite pricey

... finally got to try it after passing on it twice when the queue was too long. I had number 71 when they were calling for 68, and still I had to wait for more than 20mins. It should take them so long. I couldn't finish it as the chendol soft serve with durian and gula Melaka was too much for me and my daughter

The wait time was terrible, that being said the place should consider hiring more staffs in order to make it more efficient furthermore they're only serving a few Flavours and a variety of toppings which should not be taking more than 3-5 minutes to make. People had to wait outside the shop with a queue number and if it's on a really hot day, just imagine how their experience will be just to wait at least 10 minutes to get their ice cream served. The ice cream taste was average.

I only had a few days in Singapore and I wasnt going to miss out on this chendol soft serve.Stowed away on a side street, this humble little shop cannot be missed when you are walking along baghdad street. Ever since the extinction of chendol soft serve at 7-11, this is the next upcoming ice cream that could possibly tingle my tastebuds.True enough, all the splendid things I've heard about overrun is true. It was simply delicious and I wasn't going to share my new found love- chendol soft serve with anyone else. There is no other way I can describe my utter happiness for this little cup of joy. Smiling like a silly kid as I have finally satisfied my 10year craving for chendol ice cream. I will certainly be back for it again next time I'm in town.
