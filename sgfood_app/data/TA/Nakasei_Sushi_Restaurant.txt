Great place to have Japanese lunch.
Set menu is good too. Authentic Japanese restaurant with amazing food.
The ambience is quiet and peaceful. The dessert can be better than just 2 slices of fruit though

IT was good not the best. Very rushed service but overall I loved the food! Doing a review of only the food It gets a 5 because it was delicious. Seemed homemade and was just amazing!

For the first time since landing in Singapore I feel we stumbled upon a bit of a hidden treasure. This place has great sushi but much much more and i'd recommend trying the omakase, (chef's choice), in one form or another. Everything we tried was interesting, if in some cases a little exotic, and it all tasted spectacular. It is a bit expensive but better value than all the Japanese we've tried so far on the island. Make the trip, you won't regret it

I have great respect for the chef's work. A little expensive at $38 to $50 to $80 for a set lunch. But the quality has been consistent and value for money in my opinion. The quality of sushi that does not require soya sauce as the sushi is prepared just right.Most memorable dishes are still the seasonal fair eg. Tender young shoots on a steamed cobb of corn.I usual come here for important business lunches, so have kept it a secret from colleagues in an attempt at privacy.Today, I passed by to see them selling take away bento sets ranging $5 to $10 outside the restaurant. Rather unusual for an establishment of this quality. No doubt the bento sets looked like they were made with pride, like those we find in Japan. However, I am worried that a favourite restaurant needs to consider selling take away bento sets. Please do consider eating at Nakasei if you don't mind paying a little more for cuisine from a master chef that does not compromise his standards

Just wrote a review under the old address.Just visit Tatsuya and other restaurants before visiting here. $150 - 250 per head for Omakasei dinner. Visited Osaka 2 weeks ago but crab here was surprisingly sweeter and has far more meat. Has reasonable range of Sake so bring your own wines if you want.Lunch is very reasonable and I go there for a Chirashi often.Parking in Gallery is expensive so park on the road if you are able to find a lot
