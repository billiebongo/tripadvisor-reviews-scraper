I love starbucks, and this was one with a Singaporean twist on the food.
After 2 weeks the staff remembered me - so that was very nice to see a smiling face

This Starbucks stays particularly busy, and I can imagine why - the signature Starbucks standards are delivered in style, and it has an expansive place to sit in the front.

Can be full of people working or school kids, other times quiet. As you would expect the coffee is the usual standard consistent Starbucks, staff friendly.

Same standard Starbucks coffee from elsewhere.
Good, gives you the energy for the day, to start knocking off activities from your plate.
Recommended!

This place is no better or worse than many other Starbucks cafes. Whereas some of their cafes stand out as being particularly good in terms of service or what they offer, this place is not exceptional in any way.

Excellent breakfasts, super friendly staff. The best way one can start a day is to begin it at starbucks
