Nice rooftop bar for after work drinks. Good menu for happy hour. Went on Wednesday evening and it was quite busy. The table service was great.
5
I had my birthday dinner and thought everything was great. Their food is tasty and the vibe of each floor is fun and unique. I had dinner down stairs, cocktails on the floor above and then went to see the view on the rooftop.

Very good location on different floors. I like most the bar and the roof top bar. Very relaxing atmosphere.
At weekends you should reserve a table.

I had made a reservation for valentine’s day at least 2 weeks in advance. During the time of booking, I was informed that my reservation was “healthy”, and my date and I will have a table to only ourselves, but we will only have approx 1.5 hrs to dine - no problem.On the evening right before the day itself, I received a call saying that I will have to share my table with a group of 8 because the place will be completely filled and my initial booking of at least 2 weeks in advance won’t suffice to let me have my own table with my date. When I’d mildly protested over the phone, I was told that I might be able to be moved to a table of my own if the place had any empty tables when I get there.On the day itself, there were 6 standalone tables empty, but my date and I still had to be on the sharing table with 8 other strangers to. The other guests at the sharing table were also visibly upset and uncomfortable; and like my date and I, requested for 1 of the empty standalone tables, but were turned down by the myriad of staff advising that the empty standalone tables had other plans reserved for them.Amusingly, 1 of the guests at the sharing table decided to unabashedly tell his date the intimate details about what and how their night in bed will be after dinner at a very audible volume; exacerbating the discomfort in the situation that had been intended to be romantic.The empty standalone tables remained unoccupied throughout the cringe-worthy dinner with my date.Food was commendable, but a little pricy. Ambience and experience of the dinner that evening was utterly disappointing

We spent a month in Singapore and ate in restaurants/hawker stands of all types -- hands down this was the worst experience of all. Crazy overpriced $17 bottle of beer, a $20 burger that comes in a wrap plonked down into the middle of a big empty plate, a tiny salad at almost $20, no ambiance, mediocre service, nothing to commend this joint. Especially in comparison with what we received for the same price in trendy and beautiful places like Robertson Quay or the Holland Rd area, where a $100 meal gets you beautiful food, beautifully served, in a beautiful location. Give this has-been joint a big fat pass

The burgers are great and the venue is quirky, but there is something suspiciously commercial and manipulative about the whole thing. Anything you want with your burger (even fries - which aren't homemade, by the way) costs extra. They have some special sundown/happy hour cocktails - but mine tasted like something a teenage girl might dab behind her ears. Also I hated the music - pulsating rap or hip hop or whatever. But yes the burgers are tasty and yes the location slap bang in the middle of China Town is fun. So don't regret giving it a try

I went to Potato Head on my own one evening after recommendations from my husband who's a burger fanatic. Potato Head did not disappoint. The burgers very juicy and delicious. But what was outstanding was their service. As I was dining solo, the hostess ensured I was seated in a location where I wouldn't feel uncomfortable. Throughout dinner, I had numerous member of staff checking in on me to ensure I was taken care of. Well done to all of them!! That was very much appreciated
4
Nice ambience with warm and friendly service. The staff take great a lot of time and care to explain the menu and specials. The food menu is limited but almost every item on the menu is worth a try. The spicy chicken wings were brilliant, so were the corny fries. The burgers are one of the best in Singapore. The burger I had was nicely minced and cook beef with an amazing amalgamation of sauces. You also have a choice of adding extra toppings to further customize your burgers. Pricey but totally worth i

We have been on a couple of occasions recently for drinks and enjoyed the experience. Each level has a different vibe but you are well looked after wherever you stop. The stairs to the roof help work up a thirst but once you make it the atmosphere is one of fun if not quite loud, especially on Fridays. Great cocktails in the lounge bar which is also air conditioned and has a club like feel. Staff are attentive, polite and eager to make sure you enjoy your stay. Best to book on the weekends if you are looking for a table and dinner but we found it easy to find a space for drinks only.
4
The burgers are good, the cocktails are good but the best part of this hip place is the roof deck. Overall a cool vibe, hipster decor and good service. Had a nice burger, fries and some cocktails on the nice deck. If you are in the area I would recommend this cool spot
5
We had a really great lunch here. Awesome food and wonderful drinks. Absolutely loved the decor to. Perfect stop while walking around China Town!

Well, not really a pleasant experience at STUDIO 1939. Waiter/ Waitress are not friendly. Obviously, they served us the wrong drinks. We ordered applicious but it turns out to be another drinks. We cannot even taste the "apple"'. We are sure that they got the wrong order but to cover their mistake, they actually said that because of vinegar or whatsoever. The menu itself never state any vinegar for applicious. The drinks taste super awful! However, the staff actually allow us to cancel the drinks from our bil. (If we are wrong, I'm sure the boss would not allow us to cancel the drinks but i guess because they feel bad about it so they agree to let us cancel the drinks) After meal, we went up to rooftop bar to take photo, there was this chinese waitress who showed " attitude". I understand that she was busy at the moment but at least say things politely to us and not by just giving us that "fierce" looks. I feel that Management of Potato Head should look into the important of customer service
5
Must admit we didnâ€™t have the burgers but their selection is amazing and what we saw from Teh neighbour table looked all very yummy and everybody seemed to enjoy. What we liked was the cool atmosphere already on the way up and for sure the great roof top bar. This is aMust visi
5
We had a wonderful meal on a Sat evening with friends and family. Everyone had PHF's famous burgers and side dishes. I kept to the traditional choice of rice, stewed pork and preserved vegetables. "Tau-Yiu" bak, rice, a bulls-eye egg and Kiam Chye. It was delicious! Well done to the chef
5
It was really an awful day in SingaporeUntil I end up hereIt was on Tuesday evening but the ambiance was so goodI have one of the best burger I never eatThey propose a nice alcohol menu from all over the worldThe music...rock n roll from 80s is just greatThe deco little bit messy and stylishLove it just love it and the staff is nice 
3
We sought this spot out with excitement. The look outside is cool, the inside a bit cooler. But since we did not have reservations (although we went very early), we were hustled through rather abruptly - forced to order quick, wisked away dishes immediately, no second drink, and so forth. Coupled with a WAY over loud rap soundtrack, replete with just too many "MF" lyrics, this was not the relaxed place we'd read about. I loved the burger, but the whole experience really put me off my game
5
Second visit to this place, and it was just as good as the first one. Querky place, with 4 floors and a cool design and atmosphere. Had a burger and the Naughty Fries at the rooftop bar, and it was just... unbelievable. Highly recommended
4
We went to Club 1939 - a really nice casual place for get together and dates. It's not a dinner place, it really is for hanging out, getting some nice drinks and having bar food. the drinks spectrum is very good and the cocktails are great. The bar bites, burgers and hot dogs are really delicious. Vegetarians might have difficulty, as there are only one or two dishes.Overall, good place for hanging out after hours.Revisit Likelihood : Sure
4
Heard about their burgers and decided to try it. They were right, the burgers were yummy. The patty was thick & flavorful. The Naughty Fries was worth the calories. They have 2 set lunches that i think is value for money. Will return to try the other varieties of burgers & even hot dogs. The one downer I have & it's a personal one; i didn't like the decor
4
Visit this nice restaurant /bar for a few beer's and some light food together with my colleagues last night. The place had special atmosphere and cool design :).The food we were served hold very good standard and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Hope I can bring my wife with me from Norway next time.
4
Very nice atmosphere, beautiful restaurant and very good food. The neighbourhood is vibrant! Highly recommended if you want to eat a proper burger
5
Talk about a fun place. End of the night we got there for few drinks. By the time we got to the roof I saw how fun and beautiful the whole venue is-loved it! Roof bar was brilliant, cocktails very good too.
5
Great place to chill and relax. Service was good and the drinks were well made. Nice atmosphere on the rooftop bar.

@TheKuoKnowsProbably one of the best places for a burger in Singapore. It is their speciality, after all. And they do it especially well.The secret to a good burger is good quality meat. You can taste the quality of the ultra-lean beef at Potato Head.It is also important to cook the patties with care. And they sizzle them to a tee. They are juicy and tender and oozing with flavour.There are more varieties of burgers than the brain can comprehend. They all have natty names too.........But the plain burger is always a good test of an experienced flipper. Donâ€™t forget the fries. They are scrumptious.Potatoe Head is open all day. So try to avoid the lunchtime and dinner-time rushes, if you want to eat in peace. Or better still, book a table
4
Potato Head Singapore is more fun, more interesting and has better food than its namesake Potato Head Jakarta, or Bali for that matter. It is a variety of things packed into one building - you want a snack and a beer - got it. Want a pretty good bistro style restaurant - got it. Want a cool tropical rooftop tiki lounge - got it. Want a funky cocktail bar with bespoke tequila cocktails and dim lights and tats and a DJ - got it. Want the best burger in the city - got it. Want an iconic art deco corner building - got it. I'm fussy about the places I eat and drink, but I liked the dudes working here, I liked what they served me and I love the buildin
5
After a long flight we dropped in for dinner. We were seated upstairs. The menu was comprehensive with lots of great choices. The wine and beer menu was was comprehensive. I chose a really delicious beetroot salad and added a side of pork belly, my husband had a burger and fries which was delicious and a friend had a tasty quinoa salad. The restaurant was noisy, but that is part of the charm of a lively restaurant where the service was great and the food tasty
4
I did not intent to come as I stayed around this area for 3 days and just checking whether they have a nice bites like Potato Head Bali. It was at first dissapointing knowing they only have burgers and hot dogs. But hell, the burning man burger is awesomely dope! I will surely come back again next month when I'm in Singapore, maybe to try the rooftop ba
4
First time in Sing on a business trip and met up for colleague here. Was a little disappointed at first as the roof terrace doesn't open until 5ish but once up there had a great night. Good atmosphere and service. Worth a visit to chew the fat and waste a few hours for sure!
4
We recently celebrated my daughter's birthday here because we knew she would enjoy her favourite burger - the Smokin B Boy. I thoroughly enjoyed the same burger too this time around. But our last visit, we tried the Watermelon man and it was really yummy. It took a while to over the thought of a slice of WARM watermelon in a burger but it works folks once you have it all in your mouth!The interior is quirky and very hipster. Great place to hang out too. A little on the pricey side but if i were already prepared to pay for burgers at other joints like Omakase, i think this would be a better bang for my buck 
4
Casual comfortable setting which is perfect for getting your hands dirty and enjoying the juicy burgers and superb cheese truffle fries. The Fun Boy Three is their signature burger and there are good starters too - Beets, beef chilli were good.Leave space for desserts. We liked the sticky toffee pudding and the refreshing raspberry and mint.Service was a tad slow but otherwise ok
4
The drinks and atmosphere are perfect for a fun weekend night out with friends. It did get really crowded so we had to wait a little bit for our drinks, but the rooftop bar was a fun place to hang out.
5
Great place to hang out with family or with your partner. Great food, great drinks, good times spent ! Will definitely be back.
4
lovely place, staff members were hurried but friendly( this being a busy Friday , I can understand) , drinks selection and food were good. The burgers are a must try, Come here earlier or weekdays(closed on Monday,please call the venue to verify) to avoid the crowd. But lovely atmosphere and gathering place, there levels of seating area, all very nice and funky with different character
4
I visited Potato Head Folk on Saturday 2 September with a group of 6 friends, seated on the 3rd floor. The cocktail menu is extensive and has a good range of classic and creative cocktails. I tried the Mescalito, Whisky Sour and classic Old Fashioned - which were all very good.The burgers are good too and overall we had a great time. However, the service of some of the staff members is really below any standard - or actually plain rude. If you pay 22$ for a cocktail you can expect that it is served with a smile and some grace - which both were missing. We probably would have had some extra cocktails if it weren't for the service.I sent this feedback directly to Potato Head Folk as well, and they responded quickly. They offered for me to return for a cocktail on the house which is good service recovery and a nice gesture
4
Visited Three Buns on a Friday evening, so China Town was buzzing. Luckily we had a reservation. (Definitely, recommend booking a table in advance). We arrived before 8PM so could still take advantage of the drinks and snack specials. Make sure you order Naughty Fries with your meal. You can order just about any burger on the menu and it's going to be delicious and done-to-order. They have beef, chicken and lamb burgers on offer, as well as hot dogs, poke bowls and salads, but the burgers reign supreme.Service could be more attentive, but that rings true for 99% of the restaurants in Singapore
4
First time to visit, after hearing about it from friends. Got in early before 6pm, so everyone was congregated at the rooftop bar area, which was fine since the evening weather was good. Nice vibe and decor winding your way up the other two levels. Ordered burgers to share (one with portobello mushroom and the other with bacon and bbq sauce), and both were very good. Pricey at 23 SGD and it was only the burger (fries were extra), but taste was definitely good. If you want a nice ambience and good, but pricey burgers, then this is the place. Neighborhood around building is definitely Instragram worthy as well
5
In the stylish Keong Saik Road, home to many of the upper crust of Singapore's trendy dining, stands the veteran Potato Head Folk. Start with the first floor - a great diner style area. Dude Food Singapore style. Go one floor up to the bar, where you can have a drink and a burger (same menu). And then - the roof. Amazing view and great atmosphere. Make sure you book, otherwise you'll end up standing outside and waiting for up to 1.5 hours on a busy evening
5
We were there late on a weekday and just wanted to grep some easy food, but then stayed for a while. The bar itself is already pretty cool, but the burger's were even better. Definitely would have come there a second time if we had spend more days in Singapor
5
We didn't make a reservation and couldn't sit at the roof top bar. Instead we set at the level below, which also had a great vibe. I loved all the Bromely art around (as an Australian art lover). The cocktails were delicious. We didn't have much to eat, just came for late night drinks, but the fries we had were really good. Around 1am they switched the lights on as a sign we should leave as they are about to close.
4
This is my second visit and apart from the service from the lady who served us needs to be improved. Despite that, the ambience and food are really worth a shout-out! If you are afraid of the heat you may wish to dine and drink on the 2nd floor where food is served, 3rd floor is for mainly for standing table and some limited seats. Overall great place but service could be better.
5
My husband & i enjoyed our first time experience here. Very nice ambiance and we were impressed with the food! Amazing staff! Friendly and polite! Kudos to Priya and Daniel!
5
The rooftop is really cute and the cocktails are very good, as is the service. The atmosphere is really pleasant and fun. We didn't eat here but certainly will the next time!
5
Love this place to have some drinks with friends especially on the rooftop. The food on the menu is mainly burgers (highly recommended).
Birthday Party friendly :)
5
Very tasty burgers and nice atmosphere (especially on the rooftop). Burgers aren't the biggest ones but surely have a big taste.
5
This was my second time in Potato Head and both times I had a blast... The food is so delicious specially the Portobello toast and Fun Three Boys hamburger. Maybe the best hamburger I ever had!!All floors are lovely and nicely decorated, but rooftop is the best!!! Great to have some drinks at sunset and evening.Just be aware that could be some queuing, so arrive early! :
4
Terrific burgers, great drinks, trendy fitout and great ambience! Feels like 3 venues in one which it actually is of you count the different styles and themes on each floor with the open air rooftop bar being a perfect chillout spot to hang on any gicen evening!
4
We were a small group of friends that had a birthday dinner on a tuesday. It was a fullhouse on a weekday! Noticed that it is a popular place for catching-up, dates, birthday dinners and chilling out. We had one of the best, most flavourful burgers we have ever tasted in singapore! Loved all the mushroom and truffle-flavoured dishes; Fun Boy three and Truffle Hound, and portabello toasties! And boy, we all enjoyed the Naughty Fries, that we ordered 2 so our tummies are as full as the roof deck! (which by the way is a popular hang out spot in the city) We have enjoyed the experience because the service is as excellent as the food! Most of the food we ordered were recommended by Jaime actually! He has assisted us upon our arrival, recommendation and ordering of food, taking photo and 'til he prepared a dessert with candle and sang a birthday song. Thanks Jaime and all his fellow crew who were all accomodating and friendly!We enjoyed a lot we thought it's a friday.. too bad it's just tuesday... will comeback but this time we'll party on a friday
3
We had burgers, bangers and fries. The truffle burger and the truffle fries were good but very expensive. Have eaten much better burgers for less. Go there if you're in Chinatown but not worth to travel far for this place. This place is not for families because of the price.
4
Love the whimsical building!! We got there at 12MN, and only the rooftop bar was open by then (orders close by 1:30), but you can still go around and see the artsy interiors on all the floors. The place is very lively and cozy. Cocktails are yummy, but they're pricey and not that strong. We liked the Carribean mix - a vodka-infused tropical cocktail with complimentary Ginger ale
4
A really nice restaurant in Chibtown with a lovely hip vibe, great service and a good, varied menu It has burgers, hot dogs, beef, chicken and fish dishes with decent vegetarian options too. It's not cheap but it's a nice place and worth a bit of a splurge. We really enjoyed it.
2
First thing - they got the burger I ordered wrong.
Secondly service was slow, it was nearly impossible to get attention to ask for the bill and payment took a while.
5
The whole ambiance about the palace is inspiring, from the art to the music to the people. Multiple levels with good rooftop too.Food is simple and good, service friendly and fast.Highly recommended experience.
4
Food is good, but the rooftop experience is excellent. Without knowing, you cannot spot the place. Burgers are fine.
4
An extensive burger menu to choose from, the burgers were very tasty. The portion of fries can be larger. The rooftop terrace has a great atmosphere. Perfect for a bite and drinks with friends.
4
I really enjoyed my visit here. We had better-than-expected burgers on the first floor and then drinks on the rooftop. Burgers had the option to substitute the bun with lettuce leaves which was a very nicen touch. Different options for fries are also very interesting. The rooftop was nice but nothing amazing. Between the two there's a quieter more romantic floor which looked great but I did not get the chance to visit. Will come back again
2
Quality in food is not up to the price level. I ordered a lunch special (honkey tonk burger) 8$ for lunch time but was charged 15$. When I noticed it, I was told I got a bigger dish, and that's the reason. I not coming back
5
I didn't checked the rooftop area we were on the second floor. I Like all the decorations, the staffs also nice. Located in Kiong Saik Road area, i went there on Monday i dont know why most of the cafe's in that area were closed on Monday but Luckily Potato Head was open :)
4
Roots burger with corn fries were very tasty. Great atmosphere on the roof. Funky decor throughout. Building itself is beautiful. Book to avoid disappointment as this place is clearly popular. Service was a little slow, but staff are obviously busy with 3 floors to cater for. A little pricey for the portion, but overall a good experience
4
Decided to go there for drinks after dinner with partner and drinks, and we headed straight to level 2. Love the whimsical of the restaurant, from the wall paintings to the decorations, just fun and enjoyable. After that, we went straight to the roof top as level 2 was closing and passed by level 3, which is a big old english, gentlemen bar. The roof bar is nice and breezy with lot of fans, and you can enjoy your drinks with a nice view. It is a nice place to chill with friends.Service was friendly. Will recommend the locals and visitors to check it out
5
This is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. The three floors offer different vibes from family-friendly cafe to dimly-lit restaurant to chic rooftop bar overlooking the city. The setting is great and easily accessible right in the heart of Chinatown. We had cocktails and burgers, both of which were great
5
Best place to go in Singapore. The burgers are all to die for. The fries are a must try and their desserts just melt in your mouth.
The atmosphere is aesthetic and has an artistic flavour to it that brings the restaurant to life.
4
Excellent burgers
Rest of the food is Mediocre
Terrible service though
Book ahead specially on weekends
5
Really enjoyed the burgers!! Best I've had in Singapore (a little small though) the different fries also delicious. Cocktails really good too and lovely ambience at this roof top bar. Hard to get a seat though so go early :-)
5
This is quite a gem hidden near Chinatown. The burgers are fantastic, fries were delicious and the corn side dish was great too. Also great drinks and fast service. I would recommend this place if you are looking for something different
3
We had drinks at the rooftop, quite packed and noisy. Drinks are ok, only 1 waitress to serve the whole rooftop area, can smell the grease from the kitchen. The 1/F and 2/F have air-con, the building looks interesting.
4
Location - near the outram MRT
staff - friendly and attentive (was here early 1830 when the crowd was small)
Drinks - a variety and good
Burgers - meat based but one vegetarian option.
4
The burgers are very yummy! Best burger I have had in Singapore. The naughty fries and corn were also great. Cocktails were disappointing. Our expresso martini tasted like it had no alcohol in it and it was just cold instant coffee (Yuk!). The mojito tasted like it had the alcohol from the martini in it - very strong! The decor was cool and funky but we went there because it was told it was child friendly. In the evening it is very loud so probably not the best spot for children. And the service was appalling. The kids drink came about 45 minutes after we ordered it and followed up once. Everything was very slow and we often had to waive down the staff to ask for anything. For a restaurant that limits seatings to only 2 hours, we were there for well over 2 hours by the time our meal, drinks and dessert arrived
4
We went there for dinner last night and ordered the corny fries, the truffle cheese fries and I got the James Brown cod burger. The corny fries as always were delicious, it was my first time trying the truffle fries and they were excellent. Although the cod burger was good it is rather expensive ($28) for what you are getting but apparently, their crab burger is pretty good and is a cheaper option. Overall the decor is very interesting and the service is good (Although it took a little long for them to get us the bill), the fries are highly recommended but do note that this restaurant is on the pricier side so if you want a cheap meal this is not the best place
4
Went there for dinner last night. Had their signature burger Baby Huey Burger and the Naughty Fries. Burger was good but definitely have had better. Their sauce was nice but I think that as burgers go, Bread Street at MBS is better. Fries was good but the sauce was a bit too piquant for my taste. Good solid burger and fries place though
5
This is the second time that my wife and I visited the joint and the atmosphere is quite different between lunch and dinner times.We came here for lunch and the crowd was thinner giving it a more relaxed surrounding and us to appreciate the food and funky decoration better.We had the beef and lamb burgers with chips as sides; and they were juicy and tasty, and the chips were crispy. After lunch we moved to the sofa for coffee and desserts, which was a nice way to chill.Services were friendly and responsive, especially there were fewer people during lunch.We enjoyed our time there and had a nice stroll along the historical shop houses in the area.It's a happy place overall
5
Amazing burger and fries. A little expensive but really good. Compared to any other city. Small hole In the hole atmosphere.
5
Really love the style how they decorate it comfort for everyone for sure with style.
You can come with anyone or alone like me.
Food are good - burger shouldn't miss
4
Located centrally in Singapore and accessible to lots of good 'follow-on' spots, this is a a good reasonably-priced (but not inexpensive) restaurant / bar with nice inside and rooftop area.
5
Went here after reading the Trip Advisor reviews, wow. Went to the cocktail lounge for drinks and food. Chicken wings with bbq sauce was to die for and deserts wow!!!!!. Thanks to Jenny for the perfect service and so friendly....Will certainly be back....
3
Heading there is burger town which is fine and they are at the end of he day ok ! However the staples like fries should be first class in a burger joint and they were ordinary as was the service. Seems some of the staff focus on being trendy and partially deaf with CIA ear pieces inhibiting communications with patrons.Come on management, you have an interesting array of floors and themes and the rooftop which on the right night is v cool so step up and make the overall experience what it should be !
4
Excellent option for dinner and drinks, any floor is convenient with its original decoration but would recomend the rooftop; early arrival will ensure a table. Delicious hamburgers and original fries mixed with a wide range of cocktails and spirits. Special thanks to the staff for their courteous service
4
This restaurant mostly serve burgers. It's initially hard to choose which burger because they sound similar but the staff can tell you which ones are the best sellers. The burgers are pretty good. The side fries are surprisingly good too. They also have a wide variety of drinks to choose from. Dessert is a bit limited though and nothing special.Drinks at the rooftop and level 3 are also good for pre- and post-dinner.The only point for improvement is the service which can be a bit slow at times. Also some staff seem new / needs more training. We arrived early and had drinks at the rooftop first while we wait for our friends and we told the receptionist. We also asked the rooftop waiter to let the level 2 restaurant know that we are at the rooftop so we don't lose our table. But when we were all already on level 2 ordering, the reception called me to ask me what time I'm arriving. It's not a big deal but just a point for improvement
3
We went to Potato Head Folks and head a cheese platter before the burgers... and the crackers on the platter were stale! I guess they have been there for a while people goes there for the burgers (we had them too and yes they were very tasty). After the food we also managed to get a table in the rooftop for some drinks. I would definitely go back but stick to the burgers next time
1
my friend and I reserved a table for 2 a few weeks back but cancelled upon arrival. We were unaware of the non-parking space and was very frustrated to drive around on a Fri looking for one. Pth did not inform us that there was a valet service until after the reservation was cancelled. Bad customer service and no indication whatsoever that we could have requested for valet. This would have been our 1st time to dine at Pth but after this unpleasant experience, doubt will return. Also, was unable to make reservations for rooftop dining except walk-ins. Very disappointing. This should not be the policy.not halal neithe

Some locals told us it was the best burger in Singapore and we'd been craving a burger. The drinks were great (a Passion Fruit Iced Tea and a Sherbie Hancock - both non-alcoholic). We ordered the Honky Tonk Chicken Sandwich and the Kool Herc burger along with Corny Fries and Naughty Fries Jr. All were really tasty. We didn't finish everything, but the total was >$70 (over $50 USD). We'd pay less for the same food in Los Angeles, so for that reason we took away one star. It's a cool set up with funky decor. They have a walk-up order window downstairs on the street, an indoor restaurant on the first floor, a cocktail lounge on the second floor, and a rooftop bar. Each had a different flair. Overall: Food was great, service was great, restaurant had style and was clean, but price was a bit much
5
Visited twice for afternoon beers which led to dinner and Burgers. As a group of 10 men, always hard to impress, but everyone really enjoyed the experience. Price is what you'd expect from a Singapore "Cool" restaurant.
3
If you're into burgers and hot dogs this is the place for you! A nice casual environment (or you can dress up if you like). Great music, across all the different floors which makes it great for choice! My kids love the milk shakes!!!
5
This is for me one of the best bars I have been in Singapore, it has a great ambiance, decor and vibe. Drinks were great...pricey...but great... there is a very nice rooftop as well giving into the heart of Chinatown. I would recommend this to everyone!
1
Well it started off great catching up with friends on the roof top and enjoying the end of a Sunday session, but all the drinks are pre-made with no alcoholic hit whatsoever. The roof top has a great feel but drinks at $20+ each would have to be the worst in Singapore. Give #potatohead a miss

I've been to Potato Head a few times in the past and ordinarily its a nice place for decent burgers and drinks even if a little overpriced. What I have noticed in my last two visits is that they use a system to try and say the place is full when its not. They make you wait in line saying the tables are booked but when you reach your table there are always empty tables around you. This time they asked us to sit midway in a communal table while there were other tables empty supposedly booked. The entire communal table empty and we were told we cant sit at either end of the table. Two other parties arrived later to join the communal table. Still other tables remained free. After taking our orders, we were asked to sit opposite each other because they claimed that they had three other people coming. We refused because there were still about 4 other tables empty in the same space and the table was too wide and not conducive for conversation. While the service was poor (among other things, we got our food after other people that came after us and we had to inquire twice, once on our drinks and then on our food), what struck me was that even when we left an hour later, the same tables and others were still empty. This seems to be a system to try to create a fake impression that the place is busy whereas it's not. The feeling of having to compromise on a seat when tables around you (for example next to a window) remain entirely empty throughout your visit is far from nice. Next time I will skip Potato Head and go somehwere else. To Potato Head all I can say that get rid of this practice if you want patrons to come back.

In between shopping and dinner, we decided to stop by this bar. It's in the inner circle of Outram where a lot of bars are. Great service and great house specialty drinks. Awesome decor and a huge range of drinks. Awesome old-school rock and country music. Waitresses are alert and quick to help. Didn't try the food, but I assume it's tasty too if their drinks are great. Must try for a nice pit-sto

Highly recommend you to make a reservation if you are intending to visit as this restaurant is quite popular and has limited seats. The restaurant covers 3 floors and is a repurposed shophouse right smack in one of the trendier streets near Chinatown.Level 2 is the main restaurant and Level 3 was closed for a private party when we visited. It is a bar/lounge. There is a rooftop bar too - but it is quite small. They serve burgers which are exquisite but you might need to have 2 if you are intending to eat it for dinner. Prices average $20 a burger (without sides). They offer fancy cocktails and people do hang around after dinner - hence it is appropriate for date night. Food wise - I am a local and I think that there are other places which serve better burgers at that price (and come with fries at least). But this place is a new and popular with expats. I have never been to the namesake in Bali - but this is a city burger/cocktail bar - so don't expect the same look or vibe.

Bar with a very nice atmosphere and the selections of drinks is enormous. Staff was very knowledgeable about the drinks. Very cool
4
I recommend eating at ground level, plenty of funky choices for burgers, and try the naughty fries and ginger ninja. A stop on the rooftop bar is also highly recommended.
3
Visited this place last night without making reservations beforehand. Cocktails were good, seating was less than desirable (but not complaining as we didn't make a prior reservation). However, I probably won't return to this place as the staff exuded a certain... air.
4
 Simple and chic. Burgers a must. Meat is delicious and sauce and bread perfectly adequate. The ambiance is cool, interior decoration included. A fun and relaxed place. It is usually packed so book in advance or go early
4
Very popular place for burgers . Always great have a drink at their rooftop and try one of their stunning burgers. Naughty Fries are a must 
5
Went there with friends on Sunday afternoon absolutely famished as it was already late for lunch. Amazing selection of Burgers with quality meat and unusual fillings. Truffle cheese fries were delicious. They also have a cheese board with a very nice selection. Only comment would be to offer bread with the cheese instead of crackers or maybe both. Also the roof top was not opened (only opens at 5pm on sundays) which is shame as we would have loved to relax with a drink on the roof top and linger a little while longer. The decor inside is modern eclectic and the staff well trained and friendly. Definitely recommend this place for a casual lunch or coffee/drinks with friends
5
i went here to have drinks at night. the rooftop is a open bar. very nice and affordable drinks. will come bac
3
Went there with a group of friends. Burgers are the main food option. Small and expensive. Seating arrangement could be handled better.
4
The burgers are quite good, with "out of the box" savors which is interesting if you are fed up with the traditional cheddar/beef combination. However, the burger looked a bit small for me and there is no fries coming with the burger. So at the end the bill is quite pricey if you top up with a drink or cocktail. However the restaurant is nice with 3 floors and a rooftop. Completely different from Bali, but you should go to spend a night with friends. It was a bit difficult to get a table on a Friday night so you may book in advance if possible
5
This place is amazing. Each level is designed differently but offers the same food menu. The drinks here are incredible. The rooftop is really unique. The burgers... wow they are amazing, must try the Tuff Burger. Wagyu beef and foie gras mixed together really makes this something you must try. Then comes the Naughty fries, which are the perfect side for anything you order. love this place
4
Quirky decor and rather tasty burgers.Good burger selection.the cocktails and milkshake are worth a try.Slightly price
4
Ordered Honky tonk (chicken burger). To be precise, ordered the lunch set which costs 28sgd+. The dipping sauces for the fries were awesome. The dessert was special. Ordered the chocolate flavour. Another option was zesty lemon but it didn't taste as good as the chocolate one
5
We have stopped by for a beer. The fries are absolutely gorgeous and must try! (Can't post picture cause they've gone too quickly!)Enjoy the ambience! The staff is attentive and friendly 
4
Nice and relaxed atmosphere at the rooftop bar with good views, breeze and drink. Great place to relax after work or to wind down before dinner.
3
Interesting decor, with each floor having a different feel. Rooftop bar is fun. Food is basically burgers, but are small and expensive. Probably a place to drink (though expensive) rather than eat, unless you need something to soak up the alcohol
3
I ate burgers before in many country. This restaurant have there own decor and flavor. But burgers were little bit small size. The service was alright. 
4
I visited Potato Head Folk with some friends for a girls' night out and we had a good time. I had the 'Rambo' burger which was delicious, although not huge. The venue is very cool and interesting decor, but it is also very loud and hard to hear conversation. Eventually we moved up to the rooftop bar which is a bit quieter and was very pleasant and enjoyable in the evening
3
I expected more having heard of its reputation. Maybe because we were there on a quiet Sunday night but many items not available from the menu including fries can you believe it. The burgers were good but luke warm eventually we got dirty fries again luke warm and the slaw a bit too moist. The ambience though was delightful but sadly would not rush back.
4
First time in this resturant, with chill out concept , every floor have his own uniqueness, level 1 is the dinning area facing the road, level 2 to eat with style at the air-condition area, level 3 is a more classy look and feel with the taste of cocktails and level 4 is the open air concept.. Serve with light bite, some burger and also good selection of beer and cocktail. Nice to chill and chat with the skyline underneath.
5
While in Singapore for work for 2 months, I couldn't stay away from this place. It is so welcoming and warm, with great artwork in every nook and cranny. The food is delicious (I ate there at least once a week) - especially The Rambo and the Beats by Dre. The second floor bar was my favorite, but the rooftop is also a cozy place to see the sunset across the city. Right in the heart of such a hip neighborhood, it was nice to find somewhere low key and chill where you can also get a fantastic cocktail and some decently priced, very good wine. Also - Natalie's smile was a wonderful bonus to my visits! She and the other staff treated me so well while I was there - I want to go back right now!
4
Went to Potato Head Folk with a friend to taste the highly praised burgers there. Indeed, they didn't disappoint.1, The food. I ordered the Truff Ryder( a little more expensive than the other options, but so worth it!) and my friend got the Baby Huey burger, which she enjoyed too.2, The interior design. We had a great time by just looking at the murals in the building. 3, The service. Staff were friendly and prompt to help, thumbs up.I'm definitely coming back again
3
Went here on a Friday night and sat on first floor to meet up with friends - the atmosphere was pretty flat which was surprising but suspect the draw for this place is the rooftop bar rather than the restaurant - food was not bad but lacked any special punch, overall impression was overpriced and overrated for what you end up getting..
4
Was here for dinner and a drink with girlfriend. The food was good, especially the burger. The restaurant was situated at a corner of a three stories building. Ground floor is the kitchen, level 2 is the restaurant, level 3 is a bar and level 4 is a open roof garden. The open roof garden was packed when we reach at about 8pm on a Friday night. So please make a reservation in advance if you want to spend your evening on the roof garden. The ambience and design of the place is worth a visit. Food is of average price. Would recommend friends to have a drink or dinner here but preferably the roof garden.
4
We had the Rambo hamburger, corny fries, naughty fries, roasted almonds, Sicilian green olives and the open hot cookie ice cream sandwich. All were good but the naughty fries and open hot cookie were really amazing.Ambiance is good. Nice decoration. Like you are on a set.Waiters are friendly.Nice rooftop bar. Good experience except for the drinks. We were there on a Sunday evening. Several things were finished. So we had to change our drinks. The drinks we then ordered were really to sweet.
5
Great Place and Amazing vibe.. Enjoyed the cocktails and the burger.. Had the Truff Rider.. Wagyu Beef Pattie, Foies Gras and Black Truffle Cheese.. Was the best burger i've ever had 
5
With a friend I had a nice dinner at the 3 Buns restaurant in the Potato Head. I had a smokin' B-Boy burger with truffle cheese fries and coleslaw salad. An excellent choice. The drink after dinner we took at the roof top bar which is always a pleasant experience. Whether you are only a short time in Singapore or go there regularly it is worth a visit. And not only for the food, the interior is spectacular
4
Just came here for drinks, felt like I fell down the rabbit hole like Alice, and joined the Mad Hatters tea, except I drank alcohol
4
Really great restaurant with a very nice deco and atmosphere. Service is very friendly. Menu offers burgers (and some other items that i did not look into) and drinks/cocktails. I tried one of the burgers and i was not disappointed!! Really juicy and delicious! Most burgers range between 20-30 SGD, not including drinks/french-fries which is not cheap. Also the burgers tend to be rather small, so you might have to complete with a side that will add to your total check. I will definitely go again for the quality of the food, but i wish prices were lower or portions bigger.
1
Ordered at 7.25 and food arrived at 8.05. Apparently I have to understand that they are busy. Perhaps understanding the customer doesn't want to wait for 40 minutes on a Sunday would be the appropriate thinking, now I know that I won't disturb them again!
5
Since we arrived early for our reservation at the three buns, we went upstairs to have a cocktail on the roof. Cocktails were delicious, rooftop is really a cosy and romantic place. Afterwards we went downstairs to start our meal. We both chose the fun three boy burger, which was definetely a great choice. The truffle taste was perfect and really amazed us. It was really worth the price. Loved the place
5
Went here a Thursday night with my boyfriend. We ordered burgers and milkshakes. The burgers were really good and tasty. We ordered the fun boy three and the Kool Herc. The fun boy three was so good. I really liked the interior and atmosphere. After dinner we went up to the roof-top bar for a drink. Because the burgers were sooo good we went back 3 days later, Saturday afternoon. The burgers were really good this time too but not as good as the fun boy three. You have to try it!
4
Awesome...Good Service...good ambience..cocktails...burger.. visit them after work..for beers chill ou
3
We had a couple of (expensive) drinks here as well as their Burgers (also expensive). The burgers were excellent if a bit small. Rooftop is pleasant and there is a nice vibe to this place. Service was friendly but slow. Not sure I would return
3
We dined on the roof garden cocktail bar. We had a good Veggie " Roots" burger. Service was quite attentive. We thought, it was pricey, but it is in a city. Music and decor was interesting and good
4
I have visited potato head a few times now, and it makes for a fun dinning spot with friends . The menu is all burgers, so not a place to come if your On a diet, but delicious for a cheat day! :)
4
Highly recommend this place to those who wanted to hang out at a cool and cosy place for a drink or two. Wide selections of drinks and burgers to be chosen from the menu
4
With an eclectic decor, house specialty burgers and cocktails, this is a trendy place to chill out with friends over good food and drinks
5
We were seated in studio 1939 to celebrate my mother's birthday and we couldn't wish for a better setting. Our server, Natalia was excellent as she made sure we had all we needed and made us feel really comfortable. Now, I know a perfect spot for drinks with my mates on a Friday night
5
Some of the best burgers in Singapore. Very lively and fun atmosphere. Good & very friendly service (although a little slow at the beginning). All the burgers are delicious and cooked medium rare. Great selection of beers and cocktails. There is a super nice rooftop bar. A young crowd. Conveniently located across the street from The Library which is where we headed after dinner for a cocktail
5
Let me begin with how interesting this restaurant is. The decorations, setting and ambience are just flattering. I made an online reservation for 4 to celebrate our friend's birthday. When I arrived, I was given the choice to pick between the rooftop and Studio 1939 (although I specifically stated rooftop in my reservation). Since that evening was a little humid, I decided to settle for the Studio 1939 and the interior is just magnificent. Nevertheless, I would also recommend the rooftop when the sun is out because it's perfect for night occasions with friends or a romantic date! There's an array of hamburgers and drinks to choose from the menu and I must say I enjoyed the food, especially the Truffle Fries. I'd like to highlight the best part of my experience at Potato Head Folk: their customer service! Their customer service is excellent and special mention to one of the staff who served our table, Natalia, for making us feel at home and providing a fantastic service!! Highly recommended for a get together with friends and if you're looking for a place to have a cozy rendezvous!!
4
One of the best burgers in town! Soft buns and delicious sauce that binds everything together. Headed upstairs for cocktails after dinner. Drinks are average and expensive. Will be back for the burgers
3
A fun place with good decor and cool place to hang out with friends. Be prepared to pay extra for potato fries that ought to come as a side with your burger. Burgers are rather boring and not what you would expect when it comes with a hefty price. I have tasted better burgers at a friends bbq. Would not recommend this establishment unless you are prepared to pay for boring old food and rather diluted cocktails
3
I can understand the draw, the place is nifty and well decorated. It's got a young appeal to it. That said, I'm not so hot on their burgers or food in general. Burgers were small and to a degree a little boring. Worth a visit once, rooftop nice, but dont go for food, go for fun
5
We started with a verrryyy good burger and nice mojito.So good to eat this kind of meat in Singapore.... We have been very lucky as without booking, we managed to have a drink at the roof top. The view is not amazing but the atmosphere is really cool and the cocktails are definitely crazy good ! The one called rain maker is just the best we had followed by the zombie. Really nice place to go in Singapore
5
This is a nice restaurant and bar for those who seek to meet up with new friends and experience something new tgt. They have a variety of cigar to choose available at the rooftop! The food is also good. Loving the environment despite the price haha
3
Interesting menu with a great take on burgers, fries and desserts. The burger I had was very tasty. However the reason I have said between average and very good, is that the food was very good, however the price is very expensive, which lowers the overall experience. If you have the money, worth a visit, but are other place around where you can get good food and more of it cheaply
3
Food was very good, but service was quite poor with very long waits. Food was also overpriced in my opinion. But decor is quite nice and can be a cool place to hang out on the weekend
5
A welcome addition of this enterprising franchise!Having frequented 'Three Buns' in Jakarta I was delighted to see the quality hadn't wavered.Mouthwatering burgers accompanied by an excellent array of beverages!
5
Want to chill on a Sunday night? Not many restaurants around Keong Siak Road are open. Potato Head Folk - roof terrace is a nice and breezy place for food especially their burgers and drink in a relax environment. Cocktails are great - I particularly liked their sangria. Try the Zombie No. 36 and be surprised. Their fries are unique especially Corny Fries. You can also order a bottle of wine to share with friends
3
Really nice rooftop in a nice building. Staff were friendly and found us a seat even though it was really busy. I ordered one of their famous burgers that cost S$25 and it was quite small and only average tasting. Certainly not worth the high price. They also charge S$2 to add fries to the burger and you get about 12 fries for that. For that and 2 other sides and 1 glass a wine and 2 bottles of the cheapest beer the bill was S$100 and we left hungry. I would come back for the drinks and the rooftop but wouldn't bother again with the food
4
What a great spot to enjoy fabulous burgers with quirky names. The menu is mostly burgers with the addition of fries, dips and small sharing plates all of which were tasty and fresh. They have a great cocktail list and an adequate wine list (for Singapore). the roof top bar is a great spot to chill but get there early to grab a spot as it fills quickly. The building is on a corner in Chinatown and has the architecture to match the pre war colonial buildings of that era. A great spot to meet friends
1
I was waiting to try the famous Potato head burgers for long time and I was very disappointed. The size of the burgers are RIDICULOUSLY small and there are $26 burgers. We also ordered a plate of truffle fries and they had no taste at all and the cheese sauce on top was not really good. The place and deco are really nice but not worthy for food
4
Quirky decor and very tasty burgers. Reasonably good burger selection with a roof terrace for drinksSlightly pricey but worth a visit if you are in the area
3
Potato Head is cool and the outside bar on the roof very groovy. Just came for drinks. Excellent and efficient service. Drinks were good, but is a passion fruit mojito worth $30? Not really, even if it is served with a fresh rosemary garnish. Exorbitantly high prices don't make a place special, just expensive
4
Really casual nice place for a drink.Staff: AttentiveAtmosphere: 8Music; boringYou have different floors so try out yours!Nice little gem to catch up with friends!
1
Great place if you want over priced and very average food. What's the hype and good reviews about? The location is great but the drinks are way too expensive and the food disappointing
2
Very small McDonalds hamburgers on fancy rolls..$25 drinks $18 beers only bright spot were fries and wings. $150 for two (with 3 total drinks) better look elsewhere
3
Lovely repurposed 1938 building-- which is something that I love to see. Charming interiors and mood. a rooftop worthy of the best parties. Although I did not try their burgers, which I reckon they must be famous for, I found their menu & drinks far from being thrilling. Music at the rooftop was unimaginative and servers were too busy to be accommodating.
5
We sat on the rooftop bar and enjoyed some of the best cocktails I've had in Singapore. The menu is really creative and delicious. There are plenty of floors inside if you don't want to sit on the roof, but it's quite a nice environment to relax in with a drink. (Keep in mind that cocktails are still Singapore prices, though!
5
One of best burgers we had in Singapore. Enough said. On the pricey side. Try the milkshake too. Highly recommended!
2
Waaaay too expensive unfortunately. We get that the burgers are made with the best ingredients but throw in a few inclusive fries for good measure! $25 for half a meal (bun & patty) is too extravagant. We're from East London home of the rooftop bar/burger/hipster combo and couldn't stay for more than one drink and a small side before seeking out better value for money in a regrettably less cool setting. Decor awesome- loved the walk up the stairs. Pretty rooftop and nice views.Only VERY expensive bottled beer on offer- disappointing. Veggie burger option boring- where's the halloumi?! Overall- if money was of no concern I'm sure we'd be regulars- the burgers smelt great- shame we couldn't eat one!
2
Went here on a friday night with a group of friends. Decor is very cool and rooftop is nice but a tad bit small and crampy. We were seated at the end corner of the rooftop near the back stairs - terrible spot for servers to notice you! Had to get the attention of servers on their breaks (saw one server with a ciggy, clearly about to take a break in the back stairs) as the servers on duty didn't approach us for our orders.Asked for recommendations for beer and burger because it was so dark I couldn't even read the menu. Beer and burgers served were standard, didn't come with sides and way TOO OVERPRICED for the quality. I would say come here for the quirky rooftop, but food and drinks you can easily find better quality elsewhere for the same price
3
Heard a lot about this bar so went tonight.There's a lot of rooftop bars selling burgers in this country - to be honest this place was ok but not special enough to make me believe the hype.Minimal seating in the rooftop bar and staggeringly the expensive.Still to cut them some slack I did have the best mojito for a long time - so the guys behind the the bar must have the skills to pay the bills.Will we go again - maybe. Especially if someone else is paying
3
lively, contemporary decor, largely a young crowd; burgers are tasty but rather small, i.e. need to order lots of starters or a second burger to really fill full.
would I come again: YES, but next time have some snacks first elsewhere :)
3
I love the roof top bars in Singapore and this one is really quaint - like a tiki party. The drinks weren't terribly cold but it is a great atmosphere. We didn't eat but the burgers looked good.
5
This is the coolest place I have been so far in Singapore, the VG burger is excellent !
Good service, staff were really nice.
Don't miss out the rooftop bar!!
3
Food is good, but the portions are too small, and expensive. Great decoration and ambiance, service is good as well.
4
Great casual option for drinks and a quality burger. Been here twice - check out the roof top... just a bit of a climb up the stairs which makes you earn your first drink!
4
what the ...... really cool roof top in the city. great view for drink and grab some meal. loved the wagyu beef burger. overall is awesome!!
4
The place is really unique, with multiple levels, each with a different look and atmosphere. The food tastes great, so the few extra bucks you put in will be worth it! Service isn't outstanding, but they make up for it with a really unique experience. The rooftop makes you feel like you're not even in Singapore anymore
5
Visit with friends on a Saturday. Ordered a few burgers, fries and cheese platter to share. Seated at the rooftop with a nice view of the neighboring shophouse. Service was friendly and prompt. Adam, the manager was kind enough to bring out candles when it got too dark. Excellent place for drinks after a casual dinner
5
Definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves good music, cocktails and burgers. Although a little on the pricey side, the atmosphere and general vibes are worth paying for. There is a large selection of burgers to suit all tastes and the staff are great fun too. Looking forward to going back again

Outram MRT station. 5 - 10 minute walk.First time here. Heard so much about this place.Restaurant is spread over 3 levels; main dining area has a nice homely vibe to it, second level was decorated with plush sofa seats I think, and right at the top, the open-air roof top bar with a nice casual feel.We were seated in the main dining area which had long tables, similar to a communal style seating and laid back vibe - like having dinner at mom and dad's place. Can't complain. We had the cheese fries, chicken wings, a burger to share and a glass of wine each for the two of us. Food wise, the flavours were quite South East Asian but I thought a tad too heavy on the sauces and made it a little too rich for my taste. Total bill came out to be less than SGD100 which was decent btw.Atmosphere is nice and relaxed. Staff polite and interactive with the right amount of attention - neither overwhelming nor underwhelming.Again, while there's nothing to complain about, there's also nothing to rave about either so I probably won't be back for a while I'm afraid.Adeline LeeDinner / Drinks with a guestFebruary 201

Cool roof top bar in the middle of the city, away from the huge skyscrapers. Great for a few drinks in the evening.
4
nice place to hangout after dinner. but still prefer their main place in Bali or Jakarta. This one is considerably smaller size, but serve up pretty good bits and drinks
4
Plenty of reviews here.....drinks were nice, rooftop was cozy. Their zombie cocktail is very nice with a good presentation.
5
Simply delicious. Fresh food with great flavour. We found this place by chance and what a find it was. Service was friendly and there is loads to chose from the menu. The Beats by Dre salad was a particular fave. Yum x 3!!!

BOTTOM LINE: Very good burgers, questionable valueGOOD:* Location and vibe - really cool spot on Keong Saik with well done interiors, and you've actually got three totally different experiences in one restaurant. Ground level outdoors is more informal, second floor bar feels more like a lounge, and rooftop is yet another cool vibe. Well done concept.* Seasonal burgers - the best burgers I've had here, which was the Turkey burger a couple years back (for Christmas), and the Chew Bak Kwa burger they have available right now, are only limited edition. Their normal menu is also solid but less groundbreaking.* The small bites - Some really gourmet burger joints fall flat on their face when it comes to other menu offerings, but these guys stay pretty strong. the naughty fries are a fantastic choice.BAD:* Value - This place kicks your wallet in the balls, even by Singapore standards* Drinks - No coke products (at a burger joint? seriously?), nothing diabetic friendly* Innovation - as mentioned earlier in the review, other than a few shining stars on the main menu (naughty fries and honky tonk are my faves, having tried just about everything. truff rider gets an honorable mention) it's surprisingly run-of-the-mill in terms of selection and composition. Only the seasonal stuff tends to get interesting, but it's hard to bank on that being available every time you go.* No desserts - This restaurant is more of a destination; so when I go here it's going to be a long-talk experience. Anything along dessert lines--a chocolate shake even--would go a long way in providing a solid burger joint experience.Though I'm not sure these guys would like to be classified as a burger joint, based on the schizophrenia of their three different menus etc, I'm not really sure they know what they are
5
We booked the place for a corporate event and the triangular shaped room actually worked well as a focal point/ emcee area. We loved the waygu beef burger and the cocktails (whisky was great!). Ice cream burger was not worth the calories though. The rest of the pub food was average, but overall the ambience is awesome
3
Nice spot with valet parking in front, so no worries about coming late. Nice decent decorations and ambience to hang out with friends. The food is only decent with relatively small portions of burgers. Not a fan of the lamb, otherwise the rest is fine, I had decent fun with my fav crowd. Can try but dun expect too much
4
We visited this restaurant for something a little different. It comprises a few floors each of which are differently decorated. The top floor is open air and is just lovely. You have amazing views of Singapore.We had burgers and beer and while the quality was fine, it is expensive for what it is. That said, if you are going somehwhere for a cheap eat - this is not the place. This is the kind of place where you are going to spend a bit more, the food is good and the service is okay --- you are going to enjoy the atmosphere - it is just a bit of fun.The drinks (even by Singapore standards) were also quite expensive but again, you need to laugh it off and just enjoy yourself.I would go again
4
Pros: cool, chilled place. Good ambience, cocktails and music.Cons: the burguers were tasty and a bit too small. Truffled fries were a disappointment and highly overpriced. It's a good place to hang out with friends. But I would not come back only for the food.
3
4 differents ambiance, great style.Nice choice of drinks, a bit pricey though.Same for food, only burgers and fries, worth it but not a lot of options.Too bad that the staff would rather chat between them rather than deliver an efficient service
5
Perfect burgers and perfect fries. The best dessert I had on a simple diner as well. Reasonable prices and nice neighborhood.

I decided to try out the restaurant after I had noticed that they served a krabby patties. Being a Spongebob fan and all, I was intrigued and decided to take a shot at the chef's interpretation of the Krabby patty. On our visit, we ordered the Baby Huey, the Krabby Patty and the Naughty Fries. If I was blind to the price, and someone gave me the burgers for free, I would say the Baby Huey is an incredibly amazing burger. The Krabby Patty is decent but the real winner was the salted egg mayonnaise in the burger. The Naughty Fries were beautiful (though could use more con carne).Unfortunately I am NOT blind to the price. The Krabby patty was 25SGD without tax and it was the size of a man's fist! And that was it! No side of fries. No side of salad. Nothing! That was it! At the very least, I would have liked the illusion that I was paying 25SGD for something that looked like a meal. And this is probably the biggest shame. The burgers are good, and you know the chefs have put in a million percent of their love into getting the best ingredients into perfecting a magical burger, but the whole food experience is really sullied by the fact that I feel I cheated of my money. 25 dollars for burger the size of a fist, makes you want to throw a fist. Even cheapest burger (18SGD Baby Huey) is also the size of a fist. We sat there feeling like the money spent on the burger was to pay off for all the hipster decorations. The ambience is great, but if my burger is going to cost me 25SGD, I'd rather you burn all the decorations, and give me a burger at half the price.There are many good burgers in Singapore that are half that price in similar locations. If you want to pay 25++ for a burger, there are places for that too in more premium first class restaurants. There is just a huge disconnect in having a cool chill-out hipster place in a shophouse, that's trying to charge me premium prices.The nice things that I can say about the place is that, the service staff are really nice. They're on the ball, they're smiling, and they're genuine. Clearly the ambience is lovely too, and all-in-all the food actually tastes good. Also, they've started serving free iced water (which they didn't at first).Overall, I don't see myself returning despite the fact that the food is good.TLDR: If you're a rich hipster who likes burgers and have a small appetite, you'll love it here

I always prefer to be kind but I'm going to find that hard with Potato Head Folk in Keong Saik Road.So I'll try to keep it to the point. Burgers here are $Sg18-26 (a few are more). Byron burgers in London are marginally cheaper and I reckon notably better - and burgers seem to be what PHF do best.Service was chaotic. We waited for several items and were brought sets of drinks that were whipped away five minutes later when staff realised they'd made mistakes - happened two or three times. The wine was fine, albeit not cheap, but for $26 I'd like a decent cocktail - the zombie I had was watery, flavourless and insipid. 28 Hong Kong Street is a very chi chi alternative only 10 mins walk away and for $23-24 they make some wonderful drinks - it can be done. The Study/The Library over the road do way better drinks - and that's just 20 meters away. PHF just aren't doing it.Lastly the standard management response seems to be to say comments have been noted. That's depressing because they're fully aware that a lot of people have criticised this place but basically they seem to be resolved to do nothing. Silly approach to PR. You can only flannel people for so long. It would take a string of reviews suggesting PHF were making changes to persuade me back. :/ Sorry, but there it is..
4
Plenty of burger choices and fantastic sides. The smokin' bad boy was a popular choice at our table along with beets by Dre and the house fries, thoroughly enjoyed everything. We had pre-drinks on the rooftop bar which I would recommend even if you are not dining in the restaurant. Initially I thought it was a little expensive compared with European prices however having spent a few days in Singapore I would say it is in line with most other restaurants/bars of this standard

My wife and I came here and had a drink on the roof while we waited for a table to open up, the drinks were expensive but in line with similar places in the area, to give an idea it was £7.50 for a bottle of Pilsner which is pretty nuts when two minute around the corner in Chinatown they sell cans of lager for £2.50 to sit in and enjoy, anyway we accepted that restaurants have overheads that a market in Chinatown does not and looked forward to our burger.We both ordered the same hamburger, a beef burger with BBQ sauce, bacon which was probablyOne of the best burgers I've ever ordered. The burgers cost £13gbp which was probably worth it but bear in mind if you want Fries then you'llHave to pay more for those on the side

Cocktails & burger are good!More than everything, try the Rambo burger (lamb, feta and eggplant).. AMAZING!Bad points:- No reservation so be there early to guarantee a table in the terrace- Be prepare to wait a lot between ordering and being served- Burger prices don't include fries- Even if burgers are goods, it's doesn't justify the expensive price (2 cocktails + 2 burgers + 1 fries = $160 bill
5
Burgers are usually not my type of food, but this is one of few burgers restaurant I have to make exception for. The menu offers great variety of yummy burgers. The great thing about this place is that you can have a casual dinner in a restaurant setting, then chill out with a couple of drinks in an intimate bar setting, then catch some wind with friends over some finger food on the roof top level, all in one place, without driving somewhere else
5
Creative, amusing, eclectic, charming , funky and non portentous. No way would you know from the charming street location. Winding stairs take you past mural painted walls by a well known OZ artist leading to rooms each with their own eclectic style. Stop and look careful. Amusing beyond ! top of the spiral stair case brings you to a triangle shaped roof terrace over looking the terracotta roofs below. Like one is sting at the bow of a ship sailing away from the sunset. Get their early as its popular, burgers are fabulous as are the playful cocktails. I think you can tell from this review I found myself in this place

Arrived in Singapore last night and my Trip advisor apt suggested Potato head.Located on a busy street with lots of other bar, restaurant options to choose from.I selection the lamb burger, which was excellent chips and some coleslaw all very tasty. I had two beers and the bill came toS$70.00 which I thought was very over priced compared to venues back in Christchurch.The music played was excellent and the paintings give the venue s welcoming feel
5
Singapore is expensive and critics of Potato Head indicate its expense- in reality it is on a par with major European capital cities. The night we went we were entertained by the cocktail bar staff who helped us decide on various options and allowed us to taste new and innovative cocktails. The G-vine gin was fantastic as were the New Year inspired cocktails. In Singapore a must do for the 1939 bar- book a seat at the bar, people watch and make friends with the staff! Whilst the roof bar has other competitors in Singers, the whole package is great- visit for a special evening 
5
Fantastic juicy burgers either you like beef, lamb, chicken, fish or crab. The sides, wings and fries are even better...
4
Great menu with unique selections like honey almonds, very good wings& creative burgers. Buns were a little underwhelming but decent. Service was very slow though
5
Please come here before going out for having beer or cocktails! They have best Smoking b boy hamburger!! Order their japanese beer also! Just for the advice, make a resevation before going, it is really crowded on friday and saturday night!
2
After visiting the potatoe head in Bali, we made a special effort to find this place. While it was nota beach club, it was in a pretty trendy part of expat zone. Apart from the service and the bar on the roof, there's really not that many nice things to say about this place. We put it down to "just forget
4
The burgers in here are amazing and the fries are really good too. Fries portions are very large and can be shared between two people. Really nice rooftop area and good selection of beers. Cocktails are hit or miss, for every nice one we had, we had am equally horrible tasting one too
4
Open late, we went to Potato Head Folk on the back of word of mouth reviews from others. We had great cocktails and great burgers at the end of a long trip. Only downside was slow service especially as it was not busy. Loved the art also (that was not Bromley!!)
4
I have been here a few times and the burgers continue to be delicious and juicy. I am satisfied with the staff service and the quality of the food. I also went to to the rooftop bar - great ambience, even on a Sunday night!One of my fave restaurants in Singapore. Without a doubt
5
Ever wondered where to drink something in style? Well, this could be THE place. Different floors cater different needs: you can purchase some food on the street level and order cocktails or beer on the other floors.My favorite floor: the rooftop bar! Go there with friends and enjoy the breeze up there. Its only the 4th or 5th level....never counted it actually. But its worth climbing up to the top.Of course, the drinks are not cheap, but really: what is cheap in Singapore?!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
4
Came to this and tried the foie gras and wagyu burger, it was like burst of mankind's favorite ingredients into one bite. The burgers are always juicy and pari it with the tattertots chilli and try their specialty drinks, make a memorable experience. The decor is oh so beautifully done, combining antiuqe with modernity! Come here for the aesthetic experienc
1
Nice place and everything. However, we ordered our burgers but never got served. Starving, after 1 hour and a half waiting, we asked the waitress where our dinner was: it turned out they had run out of buns and only sides were available. Out of buns for a place that serves burgers? Weird. Besides, what about informing us earlier instead of keeping us waiting? Ended up at McDonald for a 10.30 pm dinner
4
The main dish served in this restaurant are BURGERS! Yes, there are side dishes and very yummy ones too, especially the naughty fries; this is a MUST order dish.
4
Really enjoyed this place must get back soon. The food and drinks are original and delish. The cracka lacka corn wow! burgers wow!! mouth is watering just thinking about it.
4
Burgers well cooked and the fries were great (burgers around $18-22 and large fries $5). Alcohol was expensive ($15 for a 330ml beer). The decor was excellent with lots of cartoon characters painted on the wall in an old house. Deserts well priced.
4
The burgers were very tasty. The only reproach I can make is that for the price, I found the burgers a bit small but it is maybe my own opinion.
4
Ordered Baby Huey and I loved it. It's one of those meal that you really wish it'll never end. The flavor was balanced and the size (thought small) was just right. Naughty Fries was so-so. I didn't like the burnt taste and crispy fries. Overall the meal was over priced for Singapore standard.
5
I went to Potato Head Folk with some friends last night and was very impressed. The burgers are delicious, not too much bun, not dry as many burgers can be. Every mouthful was tasty and perfect. The burgers are not massive which is also good - so you can easily pick them up in your hands and enjoy them without making a huge mess. The menu has some fun and unusual burger options for something a little out of the ordinary.Potato Head Folk is located over 3 levels in a retro building in the famous Keong Saik Street. The restaurant one level above ground has a laid back vibe. Eating with your hands is completely fine! The cocktail lounge on the next level up has a cozy Speakeasy meets Steam Punk atmosphere. It was surprisingly empty for a Thursday night but I realized why when I went to the rooftop level which is a Hawaiian themed rum bar, with great lighting, luscious plants and every table was filled. I would definitely go back and plan to soon. My only criticism is the cocktail menu in the run bar is impossible to read. Definitely try the Burning Man Burger and Pink Guava Mojito.Also good news is that if you love Potato Head Folk burgers but you're stuck in the office, Deliveroo has just launched in Singapore and Potato Head Folk burgers can now be delivered to your office
4
I really liked the interior of the restaurant - each floor looks different and has it's own charm. We sat on the top terrace which was super nice. Service was good and friendly - all very young and trendy people. Burgers were great and the truffle fries fantastic. Size of the burgers are perfect for a woman..but can imagine that men may want to have larger portions.Alcohol is rather pricey - but that's normal in Singapore. I will come back
5
Rooftop bar with style. Friendly staff and tasty bar food and burgers. Quite busy but not crazy. Good spot to continue the night in the area
3
Went there afew times for food and drinks and always goes to the rooftop. IMO its the nicest amongst 3 levels. Fave there is the snoop doggy dog. Love that they have fried shallots on it. Not sure if they are store bought or made in house tho. A little more on the pricey side too.
4
The food was great , nice ambience and decor as well. Found the burgers rather expensive. I like that it was in a nice location , short walk frm Chinatown MRT.
3
Same joint as the Three Bun burgers. Its up the stairs although they do have downstairs seating. You find mostly Caucasian crowd so you think they must know their burgers.
4
Lovely, quirky and fun place. Great burgers, nothing fancy, just plain and simple Deliciously well prepared. Drinks were great too. Atmosphere relaxed and open. Service brisk and efficient. Would highly recommend.
5
nothing better than a relaxing cocktail at roof after work, amazing second flor bar, superb! nice staff
5
Did a quick on the run burger at this place!
Great food, service and vibe!
Definitely be back next time we are in Singapore 👍🏼🍔
5
This is one chic and yummy hangout for the family! The finer things in life to share with our boys, these are burgers ( Huey is scrumptious! ) and fries ( indeed Naughty Fries, irresistible carbo; ) as well as deco. All put together perfectly!
5
This place is amazing ! Love the concept of having a different vibe through each floor (restaurant, lounge and rooftop). The rooftop is great for an evening drink, it's very "hawaïan chic". The lounge is in a more "50s" mood with big leather seats and a giant bar made of wood. The restaurant is quite chill, however the food is costly. Would definitely recommend it for a night out with friends or a date !
4
Went to this place a few times already and so far, my experience is very much likeable. I've only been in the bar area (they do have restaurant and rooftop bar, too) and is very much satisfied with the service and drinks i've had. Prices are not cheap but then again, if u are looking for a place to have just a few drinks and have a bar with character ti enjoy with ur friends then this place is a good candidate for a venue
5
The rooftop bar was an awesome little place to go for drinks and a burger. Even though it was busy our waiter was very attentive and showed excellent service. I enjoyed my cocktail. But the burger was honestly the best I have ever had! I had the four floors and was not disappointed at all! Will be back again next time I'm in Bangkok!
4
This is a little gem and definitely worth the visit for after work drinks on the roof or quieter drinks inside. a great vibe and a great place just to chill and catch up. A good little menu on the roof very simple but delicious. Great service and will be making my way back to continue the cocktail, rum and beer list. Enjo
4
I have been here 3 times in the last month, and never fails to disappoint. Superb décor, city-cool, and the most innovative burgers in town. Set against a chic backdrop: there are many hideaway spots to discover; like a hidden cocktail bar - mid-level @ Studio 39; and a beautiful roof-top terrace: which would not look out of place in Shakespeare's Midsummer Nights Dream. Brunch with friends, or dinner in the evening make this an evergreen spot. Creative / media types abound
5
Firstly, we didn't eat here but headed straight to the top of the building to the roof top bar. It was a running theme of our bar tour of Singapore to be up on a roof with a view but unlike the main tourist spots this is a relaxed, chic and completely down to earth pace like no other we experienced. Super friendly staff, great cocktails - Faz & Furry our favourite - and a throwback to old Singapore, a must visit
1
We went in to have a nice burger. When we ordered I told the waiter (well, student that pretends that he is a waiter) that I'm allergic to bell peppers. He told me that the burger that I wanted had a sauce with bell pepper in. And that the sauce could not be replaced by ketchup because they don't have any. So, I wanted to make another choice. He then highly recommended the special burger of the day. To my surprise, he answered 'yes' when I asked him if that one also contained bell pepper. We should have left there and then, but went for a 'third time lucky'. After looking at the menu I thought I had found the only burger without bell pepper: the crab burger. Tried to order that, asked if it was without bell pepper and got the reply that the patty already has bell pepper in it. We left. What a lousy place. Maybe they should rename the joint Bell Pepper Head Folk or start a Taco Bells! They already have the right level of staff
3
Went there with another couple for dinner and drinks. The menu is burgers and fries, exactly what we were looking for. We ordered two burning mans, a Baby Huey and the cod whatever it was called. Both kinds of fries and some wings. The burgers were good but terribly small for $25-30. Don't get the cod thing it is nothing like what is described on the menu and tastes horrible. The fries are good especially the ones with Chili. Don't even bother with the wings. If you want good wings go to Smokey's BBQ. The drinks are good but $25-30 for a cocktail seems steep to me. Overall, I won't be going here again to eat. Had to have a couple of tacos after just to fill me up. Swanky drinks OK but you pay for it. Oh yeah $15 for an Ashi.....really?If you have deep pockets go nuts.
3
Singapore is pretty expensive (London prices). But $180 for 3 burgers, 1 hotdog, 2 sides and 4 drinks is mental money. Food was nice but not worth the money.
3
If you have been to the Potato Head in Bali, this is not going to be like it. The concept of this place is totally different! This is like a burger joint with awesome yummy drinks!The burgers are pricey and the size of the burgers are also quite small like a Mac's burger maybe. Wide ranges for beef burgers and about few options of fish, chicken and lamb. I had the lamb burger which i thought was really tasty but really small as well :(My friend had the chicken burger - Not so good.All burgers are from $20-$40 bucks (+/-).Starters were about $10, not so great..Dessert was about $7.. they were good :)The best part of this place is their amazing drinks! They were really yummy.I would probably just go back for the drinks
5
My boss brought me here since I was in town for meetings. Really nice crowd, ambiance and more importantly excellent food and beer! Try the beer from Czech I just can't remember the name. Make sure you get reservations because it tends to get full quite often. Also you should try the roof top
3
I have been a couple of times. The burgers are good but not generously sized for the price and you pay extra for chips and side dishes. The service really needs to improve, especially in the welcome, which is almost non-existent. The availability and allocation of tables on different levels is very disorganised. Good milk shakes, something that too many burger restaurants do not offer
3
Another Friday night, another amazing bar to discover in sultry Singapore.We were looking for something a bit different for a couple of drinks and some bar snacks.The rooftop bar had a lovely relaxed atmosphere and the cocktails were delicious, if outrageously priced. But the bar snacks? We ordered the cheese platter for a whopping S$28 and received three microscopic slithers of sorry looking cheese alongside a few holy communion-style wafers and a blob of dry onion marmalade. I'm sorry I didn't take a photo as it was outrageous. I don't mind paying for quality or for location but I do mind being ripped off! Shame as we won't be coming back. Fool me once..
2
I came here with a girl friend for a small girls' night out. The host at the entrance told us that the rooftop bar was full, but we were welcome to check out their cocktail bar indoors. We went to the dining area instead, as it looked more welcoming and asked to be seated there as some tables were available. The waiter instead called the host to ask if he could give us a table. Apparently the host downstairs told him to route us to the cocktail bar. Fine, we went up one level and found the cocktail bar full. We went back to the dining area and told them that it was rude to keep us walking up and down, they said it was a Friday night and they were busy. Being crowded is not a problem. Being unable to handle it is. It used to be one of my favorite hang outs at Duxton Hill, but now I'll take my business elsewhere.
4
Came here on a recommendation by a friend. Loved the decor to the max! We ordered a choc milk shake, a baby Huey burger, a hotdog, wings and a zesty lemon for dessert. We were rather disappointed with the choc milkshake. Instead of a creamy chocolately velvety smoothie kind of beverage, it was instead blended/melted vanilla ice cream with some chocolate rice at the bottom. The staff immediately changed the milk shake upon noticing the look of perplexity on our faces which I felt was great. The wings came next and were crispy although if there was more sauce, that would have been better. They missed out on my order of the baby Huey burger and so gave me a complimentary dessert. While I liked the zestiness of the lemon, it Could have done better with a base or crust. In its current state, it tasted like lemon flavoured cottage cheese and felt a little flat.
5
Potato Head Folk is a true gem. The staff is incredibly accommodating, the atmosphere is excellent and the decor is wonderful! Imaginative and tasty drinks on the tropical rooftop bar top off the experience. I heartily recommend Potato Head Folk!
5
Nice Decor. Nice soft Burgers. The place was very nicely done up with cool decors. The burgers were soft and juicy !Value for money!
5
Love The Places & Love The Awesome Bartender who never let's me down in my drinks. Do remember if you don't know what drinks to try from the menu, call for Bartender Irwan and tell him what you feel like having.
3
Stylish and one of the most interesting places. Great interior and unique rooms. Roof top is the highlight. This reflects immediately on the prices which is okay and fair on deals. I personally found the Hamburgers way too small and overpriced. Drinks yes, food many other opts in the area.
5
I'll admit - I'm from New York City and have eaten many hamburgers that have been called "the world's best" - and often after traveling for large periods of time, a taste of home is necessary to ignite a second-wind...so when I told friends I needed a break from traditional Asian fare and wanted a burger, I was skeptical about what I might get. But Potato Head Folk lived up to my Western expectations. I ordered the 'Rambo' - a lamb burger with feta. It was the perfect size, not outrageously large, but filling and just the right amount of a juicy, finger-licking mess. Perfectly cooked and delivered to our table in a respectable amount of time. The 'Naughty Fries' were a great international take on loaded french fries that required a fork to eat, but were easily consumed by our group of three. We didn't have room for dessert or a shake, but the cocktails were delicious and disappeared quickly.
5
A 'quiet' evening with groomsmen and groom perfectly organized by Potato Head!We wanted a different experience before, during & after dinner. And that's what we got and more! Delicious cocktail on 3rd floor, best burger I ever ate, with fries to die for on 2nd floor and finished with cleansing ales and cigars on the rooftop. All in all, a great place to go for any occasion
5
On the Keong Saik foodie haven street, this is our go to place for burgers that hit the spot. If it isn't raining and the weather isn't too hideous in the evening, go early for a spot on the rooftop - its tiny, strung with fairy lights, great ambience and some nice rum cocktails - try the zombie :) In the burgers - all are good (haven't tried the veggie one though) - but especially nice is the truff ryder :)
4
Seemingly never ending stairs with lots to offer on the way to the top. Potato Head offers great cocktails in a rooftop setting - a great place to kick off your evening
5
Where do i begin? Well some people said this is a must visit Bar in Singapore. Well I'm just gonna say, Let It Rain cocktails in my face! All Bartenders area doing great cocktails but this one particular guy who has curly hair with lots of haircream, I think his name was Mohd Irwan and he is one of the best shaker. He was a great company in the bar if i must say. Tasted some of his drinks such as - Heard Through The Grapevine, G S.I.C, Due North/Whisky and Chinatown Mohito - Fuhhhhhhh!!!! It takes my breath away and I was thinking that if this continue then i will be stuck for few hours which eventually i did. Mohd Irwan indeed is a guy who make sure you will never get thirsty and surprise you with his cocktails. Great ambience/atmosphere and bla bla bla.. Cocktails says it all!!
5
Lovely place! If you are looking for good burgers, here's the place. Cocktails are very nice too. The truffle chips ($22) is different and worth a try. It's got 4 levels and each one will surprise you. I love it's decoration on each level. Fantastic to bring your friends there big group or small
5
Great rooftop bar - very cool and funky - like being in Havana. Fabulous cocktails with some nice touches like the fling cinnamon sticks on the zombie
5
Great restaurant/bar spread out across 4 or so levels in an old shophouse. We had drinks on the rooftop bar as day turned into night. Great location, great drink menu. Yes, it's expensive... but the views and ambiance are worth it.
4
Love their low-rise rooftop bar- always take visitors here. Breezy atmosphere, relaxed environment with a tiki Hawaiian feel
1
4 of us went for pre dinner drinks.We ordered 3 cocktails and 1 beer.We decided to order a shot each, so 4x B52We then order another round of drinks and another round of shots.Bar bill comes S$387.The B52's = $80$80 for 4 shots I complained to the barman. He said that was the price. I asked for manager, who kept us waiting 15 minutes only to tell us that's the price and tried to justify it.He failed to acknowledge our unhappiness nor did he offer a discount or goodwill gesture.These folks ride off their name.It's nowhere as decedent as Bali, so stop trying to be.Overpriced and bad service
4
The roof top terrace is really a unique place in Singapore, small and causal with great views and simple decoration. Nice music and ambiance - perfect for an aperitif after a long day walking around. But boy it is so expensive!!!! 59$ for 2 cocktails does not sound reasonable even if they were good and original. We did not try the food as the price seemed also overpriced. While we loved the experience I am not sure we would go back..
5
My lovely lady took me to this nice place.First, i was fascinated by the decoration, really nice and trendy ! But when the food came, My taste buds were unleashed. Good burgers and real home made fries, not frozen french fries. The service is good and fast. and you have to take a drink in the rooftop at night, nice view.Thanks to my love to brought me there. i recommend this restaurant
4
I took HRH and my four kids for lunch today. Its a great space with really good and attentive staff. The kids loved their burgers but they were covered in salt (the burgers initially the kids after eating them). I ordered the spicy beef burger which was good but a plain cheeseburger would, in my opinion have been better. Mine was bordering on the too cute for its own good with a rather confused jalapeÃ±o and miso? sauce. The patty was delicious. Mine was also salt encrusted. The chips were nasty and processed. I ordered the pale which I was told was a dark beer it really was it wasn't a pale ale at all but was very nice. A few tweaks and this could be a great place to visit regularly
5
Great drinks! Good variety and they will make you a drink thats not on the menu if you tell them what sort of drinks you like. Great service and our sever Anis was great and beautiful too. Haven't sat inside but on the lower floors but they have a good atmosphere too
5
i'm a sceptic and had heard about this place as the home of the "new" best burger in town, so I was prepared to be disappointed. Sadly, I wasn't. The place is awesome. Great burgers, casual vibe, nice folks etc - what not to like. My ONLY complaint/wish is some more variety on the wine list. Nevertheless, love this place.
3
Decoration is original, let's put it that way. Burger was delicious but french fries were horrific. Not to mention completely overpriced ... I mean 75$S for two burgers and a french fries shared that's crazy
3
The food is good, but the price is quite expensive...
And the place is quite comfortable, and the place is always full until dawn..
4
Even though I'm no fan of burgers, I do like the ones at potato head folk!The ambience is really nice.I see a lot of people saying it's overpriced, but since I'm living in Singapore, I understand these are quite normal prices for restaurants in Singapore.
3
Rooftop terrace is great and has Caribbean vibes with nice music. Food is great and wine list is just what you need... but overpriced..
2
So last month me and my friends went to the hyped up Potato Head new venue and I got so disappointed.. Service is really poor and slow, we waited 45 minutes for our drinks. The burgers are totally overpriced: we paid 28$ for a burger that was nothing but average. Been to burger places around the world and I can testify that that was not worth it at all.The rooftop terrace is nice but there again, the drinks are really expensive and the cocktails nothing special. For 20$+ I would have expected some killer cocktails....I really enjoyed Potato Head in Bali and Jakarta but this venue, even thought the building, design and location are nice, is clearly poorly managed. Won't go back : 
3
We had dinner meeting with a customer here and it is really a nice place. However the service was soso and food and drinks are really overpriced. You will pay 15 Singdollar (++) for a bottle of beer which is not reasonable at all
5
This is an outpost of a Bali beach restaurant and it has a hippyish beachside feel, especially the rooftop bar, open to the sky. We had really excellent crabby (crab) burgers and chips. The staff were outstandingly good, combining in some magical way being completely laid-back with also being completely on the ball
3
Ended up there as there was no other place open for dinner after 10pm. We were 3, had 1 hot dog, 1 veggie burger and one normal burger with friends, plus a cider and a coke and we spent more than 100SGD. I don't think it was worth it and probably would never come back
5
Super cool rooftop restaurant and bar. We got here at about 7:30 and there was a good mix of families and couples. By 9pm it was buzzing and full and all the children had gone home to bed. Awesome views of the city, awesome food (burgers) , awesome cocktails and drinks and finally awesome prices $$$You can't reserve a table on the rooftop, so be ready to come early or wait. A wait at the bar does ease the tension..
4
We went there afterwork with some friends to have some drinks. As the rooftop does not take reservations (except you intend to spend at least S$ 2000) we waited for a table about 40min. The very friendly waitress brought us our first drinks, which helped a lot! ;-) After 40min we got finally a table for 4...the menu card is full of burgers (all priced around S$20). We all ordered burgers...and i tell u these are fantastic!! S$20 for such a burger on this lovely rooftop in Chinatown absolutely worth to go there! The only negative point is the no-reservation-policy and the long waiting hours...so go early or dont go!!! ;-) We all will definetely come back
4
If you are tired of South East Asian cuisine, it is one place where you can sit and enjoy burgers - on a rooftop restaurant.I had a chicken burger. God! it was so big. It had 3 patties and really yummy.It also played some good music and you will feel like you are at a Hawaiian restaurant.You may go with your colleagues, but don't go for professional business meetings there.Advice: Just go there a bit early or you won't find table to sit
3
Pretty good burgers though it's best if you share else you'll feel really 'gelat'. A little overly-publicized and everything is just meh though.
5
great burgers, great cold beer, great area. not cheap, but worth the money next time in singapore will visit again
5
We went here early evening and were lucky to get a place on the roof terrace without having to wait. Already going up the stairs, one can see this a cool and stylish place. The roof terrace has a little bar and a cozy, breezy, laid back atmosphere. Service was friendly and fast. The mocktails were creative and tasteful (this is rarely the case elsewhere).We ordered a burger, salad and some special fries with chilly sauce (highly recommended!). The food was simply fantastic: presentation is cool. All in all, the place far exceeded our expectations and was worth every penny. We will come back during our next visit to SIN.
5
I went there first time and it was amazing ! The decor is more than awesome ! But service very very slow need to improve.., We order burgers tenderloin with foiegras. It's so so yummy and unforgettable. The place looks cool and this is the new place is the best for Singapore land. Highly recommend before you going for party must burn your stomach here first !
4
I love the atmosphere there, especially the rooftop, music is carefully curated! BUT the price tags are the highest in town, even for the simplest things you will order! Expect to pay at least 50++ for a burger+fries+beer (and it is not wagyu beef patty, nor the best burgers you'll ever have) and even more with a cocktail. The staff is very helpful though. I go there regularly but I would definitely go more often if the value for money was better.
1
The dÃ©cor and the ambience of this place are really nice but that's where the good stuff stops! We got there early and went to the roof top bar, go later and you won't be allowed up if it's full. Be warned, the prices are exorbitant even by Singapore standards, small bottles of beer average more than S$15++, a gin and tonic is S$20++ and that's if you can get the staff to serve you - we waited over an hour for a glass of wine and after chasing it several times gave up, when it finally arrived we'd finished eating so she sent it back. The food is also poor and over priced - an average of S$25++ for a burger wrapped in greaseproof paper and that's just for the burger - no fries, no condiments, no plate and no cutlery, I'd be embarrassed charging S$10 for what they are serving up. This place is simply a rip off, it's over hyped and, over priced, don't go there
4
I have been to this awesome burger joint a few times for lunches and dinners. It's got a great buzz around it, seating areas outside and on another 2-3 levels with a rooftop too!The style is very mixed, some historical items mixed with random art and a very light and airy feel inside. It's always busy and is well worth the wait.The food it great, proper flavours and sized burgers, as well as some creativity coming out of the kitchen. Not serving water though is a bit mean and having to pay S$5+ for a small bottle si not right but the great atmosphere, super food is what they are doing best.It's not cheap. But at least it's fun every time you enter
4
We had a lazy start to last Sunday and we decided burgers for lunch it will be. I read a few reviews and saw that this place was rated on both ends of the spectrum, but my son said " ignore the bad comments dad, they are simply untrue" . My 16 year old was spot on. My wife and younger son, absolutely loved the burgers. I found them excellent too. Not cheap, but hey, when was the last time you had something excellent on the cheap? Takes a bit of time to serve, but worth it. Well done!,,
5
We went on a really humid night and were very happy to sit outside. The food is quite expensive by the time you order drinks, but well worth it. The burgers we had were absolutely delicious without being too greasy. The patties were perfectly cooked according to our preferences. Would also highly recommend the house made cola and cocktails. Never went inside so cannot comment on the other parts of the establishment but will definitely be back next time in singapore to sit outside, people watch and enjoy the ripping food

I absolutely love this place and I am deeply mesmerized by the interior design of every level from the restaurant to the dapper cocktail lounge and quaint rooftop bar. I was greeted by friendly staffs and they are always ever so ready and attentive. It was a perfect chilly night to just sit and sip. Tho the stairwell spooked me a little with the miniatures and murals. Ha

Loved everything about the place. The menu, the ambiance, the decor and the service. Had a burger and it was super yummy. The wine list at lunch needs some work but otherwise great place to visit.

We had a great time with the drinks at this place. Great selection and good services. Also the music was good and a nice view

Im particularly pfffted that we were not allowed to be seated in the restaurant if the entire group is not present. I know there are restaurants that practice this, however, I think this is a pretty bad customer service practice in general. The thing is, I tried to make a reservation beforehand and they dont take in reservations too. So personally I felt that this practice makes it pretty difficult to coordinate group dinner. Even when I informed the staff that the 1 Adult + 2 children are already on the way and parking the car, however, we were told that they still can't allow us to be seated. If I can make the food order immediately once seated, I dont see why I shouldnt be given a seat, since the remaining pax are reaching in 10 minutes. They do have a non air conditioned F&B bar on the first level where we can wait for our friends, however, seeing the tables get filled up and wondering if we still need to wait if our friend arrived made the experience unpleasant. The menu is pricey, especially so when the food is pretty average. Overall, the experience was spoilt and the food quality didnt help pull up their ratings to make me go back there again

The rooftop bar is amazing! Really nice setup, drinks are very expensive but the food was great! We had the naughty fries and the wings, they were awesome!

I can't, for an instance believe the quality of food that was laid before my eyes..It was atrocious.Plain horrible,bland and disgusting.I had great burgers and chicken wings before in many places around the world.This one beats the rest hands down in terms of taste.its bloody horrid!!!!!The burger patty is dry. The bun is soggy. The house chips comes with a gooey topping they call cheese.The chicken wings looks like turkey wings. Huge n distasteful.they serve shallots on the side, God knows why... The ginger beer is flat.I honestly don't know what I was eating. The prices are exhorbitant and for what you are paying, I think you'd be better off in Macdonalds.Save the money, go grab a burger from Mac or BK. Noisy as hell place, u can't even engage in a decent conversation.Don't waste your time here.I will never, ever come back, even if they paid me.

simply their service is poor.they forgot our order. i waited one hour for just one burger.they did not apologize but asked me if i really ordered it.i ve been there at 7PM. of course i eat dinner!!!taste 5$ burger but they charge 30$.雰囲気は好きだけど店員のサービスが最悪。オーダーを忘れ1時間以上ハンバーガーを待った。もちろん謝罪なし。普通に辞めて欲しい。平日にいったけど音楽も結構うるさかった。なので10時PMくらいにいって数時間いて帰るのがいいんじゃないかと思う。本当残念なバー。バーガーは美味しくないのに30ドルもする

It seemed like a hip place ...But when I saw what I had ordered, I was speechless. For 18 SGD one may expect a meal more or less, but what was put in front of me was the lousiest Hotdog I have ever seen.In 3 years of living, eating in Singapore, by far the worst experience. This is a crime against food and a ripoff of the worst kind.Will check occasionally how long such a business model will last.Service was non-existent too, you order through a window and you might get your drink if you complain often enough

Me and my friends just came to this place last week. Heard about Potato Head Bali & Jakarta, so we really excited that finally PTT Head has open their branch at Singapore. We arrive around 7.15pm, just to found out that most of the floor no more seat. Unless we wanted to seat at level 1 ; outdoor & with no view. But the staff said it would be 10% cheaper. But we still trying our luck, so we went to all floor and when we there, there's no staff around. So we just went to rooftop which were packed, and staff were busy serving guests. So we just stand at the rooftop entrance waiting for any staff to serve us, end up just to be told need to que for don't know how long. Because there were 2 guest before us, we already starving and we couldn't wait any longer. So we went to level 3 & 2. Which is tiring by the way.Staff at level 2 told us, if we didn't mind to wait for 1 hour, we could get 2 seat without sharing with another guest. If not, we could get seat straight away but we need to share table. We chose to share table, since we starving already.I order Baby Huey burger, cost me $20, while my friend order Burning Man burger. We order naughty fries & 2 milk shakes. Around 15 mins later, our food came and I was so disappointed with the taste of the burger. Nothing special. Don't know why people said the naughty fries taste good, for me its tasteless. We spent around $85 for 2 people. For me just to eat burger, fries & milk shake, it's very pricey !The only good things was just the ambience. Very chic design and good to take picture all around this building.I won't come back

$28 for a burger. Noisy as all hell. I could hear the music blowing from the place before it even came into sight and with 50,000,000 hotels and restaurants surrounding I'd hate to be a guest attempting any kind of rest at 2am on a Friday night 5 metres away from this upmarket McDonalds. Tone it down and have some respect for the other business' trying to make a dollar is my tip for Potato Head Folk. And for those wanting to pay these bucks for the burger. Go right ahead :) you deserve i

Only had drinks there, at the cosy bar on 3rd floor. Very nice waiters, good selection of wine by the glass. It looked like their cocktails are best sellers but we preferred wine. Maybe a bit too noisy for a romantic dinner, probably great place with fiends. Price (at least for drinks) on the high side. But overall we liked the place
5
Great food, great service, great atmosphere and the lamb burger was sensational! If you are in Singapore this place is must try.

Set in a 1930's building, Potato Head is a trendy place to enjoy well made burgers. The interior is well designed and quirky. The burgers arrive wrapped in paper and the drinks are wondeful. A really good night out in Singapore.

Burgers as high as $28. First of all, it's a burger, and slightly better than your average fast food version, and the description is written in a slightly fancier menu but geez, $28. For a Burger. Enough said. The chicken wings were recommended. They were tasty, and so were the naughty fries (although the name is gimmicky to say the least), but they didn't stand out amongst other wings and chili cheese fries I've had before. Then again, it's hard to go wrong with wings and Chili cheese fries. Especially with an ice cold beer.Cocktails $15-19 for a cocktail in the restaurant. Up to $23 in the Rooftop bar. I tried a few and none were noteworthy. Several of my of my lady friends ordered one that I can't remember the name, but it was very sour and all of the ladies couldn't finish their drinks. Again, not memorable enough to even remember the name. Also, the acoustics in the rooftop bar were terrible. There is nothing to absorb the sound and you can hear everything all at once, literally everything. It was like forks in my ear drums. The dessert, however, was nice, and with a name like potheads, how could you not try? Would they be "special" desserts? Afraid not, but delicious puddings all the same. I'm just surprised the SPD didn't bust in and arrest me mid-bite

I can understand the divisive nature of burger innovation. Our party of four had mixed reactions to Chef Adam Penney's creations. But for me, Three Buns at Potato Head Folk is well worth trip there and perhaps, even the price. If you like your burgers packed with punchy flavors this is the place for you. Purists can have the Baby Huey which is a nod to cheese, onions, lettuce, pickle and tomato kind of burger. But even that had a spin on it with the house made T.O.M. sauce. I had the Smokin' B-Boy which was a smoked cheesy, burger with beer and treacle cured bacon and a tangy bbq sauce. This paired surprisingly well with the South African Cabernet Merlot for the Cape of Good Hope Winery I had (yes, a burger joint with a wine list!). The other members of the party asked for the lamb burger and the fish burger which was out. If the party was larger I'm sure someone would have asked for the fried chicken burger. Would I come again? For someone whose comfort food is burger, I definitely would

Pricey, overly complicated burgers aren’t usually my thing, and normally, I wouldn’t bother reviewing a hamburger with such a steep price tag. But this needs to be written so yáll can be warned. The humble hamburger has certainly come a long way from its fast food origins.With all of that said, did the cheeseburger live up to the high expectations? I had the smoking B-Boy and yes, it did. It was as good as I had hoped but it didn’t surpass my expectations. The Naughty Fries – Spiced béarnaise, hot beef chilli, crisp shallots, parmesan & sesame seeds – were awful. Instead of being thinly sliced and crisp it was massively soggy. It was so bad that I couldn’t get past four measly fries, despite being hungry enough to finish the entire serving, and then someThe main problem with offering a hamburger for between $20 – $28 is living up to inflated expectations. Every time I eat a burger that’s more than $15, I can’t help but do the “burger math”, using a cheaper alternative. Potato Head’s burgers costs more than Fat Boys and 10 times as much as ‘McDonald’s, and sadly, wasn’t any better than either. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…(www.perfyi.wordpress.com

This is the second time I've been here. The first time was with my girlfriends for lunch. The service was very good and so was the food. It's in a great location and easy to find. It's not expensive either. The second time I went was with my husband, and he loved it. We ate on the first floor and headed to the rooftop bar for a drink.My husband was also impressed with the place and we will come back. They sell burgers and hotdogs. There is a vegie option. It comes with no sides. I ordered the Dr Dre Beets and its very good. There is alot to choose for as in drinks

Set in a lovely refurbished 30's triangular 4 storey (same shapeish as Flatiron in NYC) Chinatown building this Indonesian "Institution" has spread it's wings and landed in Singapore on what is surely a start to big Asian expansion if not world expansion.. Potato Head folk , is up (or way up ) market burger and fries as it's 4 levels allows you to choose your level of sophistication (with the higher levels being more classy) . You also choose level of food .on the 3rd floor, we were a group of 3, 2 ate the bacon burger which is so tasty and obviously good grade meat. One colleague chose the new ($50ish) foie gras burger which was awesome. Nothing is plain here. The beers were exquisite micro brewery japanese pale ale and the fries were the decadent style with everything on top. Reserve even a stool here if you plan anything not on street level even on a weekday! The 4th (top) floor we had a peak, open air, packed with beautiful 20 something mostly ex pats by the look. Oh and the service is excellent.. It can be a before or after drink or a meal. PH lends itself to most options for a good night. If you are coming by MRT I like Outram station better than Chinatown.

A tour de force - taking the humble burger to an unsurpassed level. Decor reminds of looking at a classic Turner oil painting, each time you return to it you uncover an element of it's character you hadn't previously noticed. Shame no rooms, they'd be marvelous no doubt. Staff were diligent without being over bearing. And still the food stands out. Next time we're heading to the bar

Came here with friends for a pre-dinner drink. The building appeared to be a historically preserved building and is impressive. It sits between two roads that fork off of one, so it is a triangularly shaped building. We sat on the 3rd floor bar (ie, 2 up from the ground floor). The bar is prominently setup in the nook of the triangular floor-plan and is surrounded by shelving with bottles of spirits all around.The atmosphere was very cool and it was a perfect place for a drink. Apparently my friends told me the place also has great burgers, so I'll plan to return to test out his opinion

Great place for burgers. Sufficient portion without being overwhelming. Beef patty was really done well and meat was good quality. The 'Burning Man' burger was delicious if you like them spicy. We enjoyed the 'Naughty Fries' very much. Very tasty. Service was warm, attentive, humorous and friendly on a Thursday evening dinner. Enough staff for them to respond quickly when you need something. Also love the decor! Relaxed, hip and comfortable. Though a tad expensive, it was overall a very good experience. Definitely will go back again.

It was packed when I went on a Saturday evening. As they do not take reservation, we had to settle for the rooftop area. It was all good as they had huge fans to keep the area cool, until when the crowd started streaming in. We were almost shoulder to shoulder with strangers sitting at the seats beside us. There was definitely insufficient space for comfort, and we could surely hear the entire conversations ongoing beside us. Despite that, the service staff were friendly and prompt. Food were amazingly good, though having too much of the flavourful food can get quite revolting. Nonetheless, the fries and wings are recommended. As for the drinks at 1939, cocktails are priced way more than some bars. Definitely would not return for the expensive drinks. Though the ambience was quite ideal for conversations

Walked in during afternoon tea time with plenty of seats available. The burgers are just simply amazing! They're average in size but one of the better burgers I've had. They do give you a healthy portion of fries (extra cost). Service was ehhhh. Never came to check on us even when our water glasses were empty. Overall the taste of the food is worth a trip but I can find great burgers elsewhere for a more reasonable price.
5
I can say enough how much fun it was having a drink on the roof. The barman was a complete star not only made great drinks had a real personality and as a result we stayed longer than we planned, spent more than planned and enjoyed it more than planned.Service and drink quality was good as anywhere I have had in abig city and to be outside was just fantasti

Came here for snacks and drinks on a weekday afternoon. It was nice to almost have the whole place to ourselves. The group ordered some burgers, hot dogs, beers and other drinks/iced teas/juicesFirst of all, the decor is cool/hip, in a devil-may-care way, not in a W hotel way. Not that it's bad or anything, just different. All 3 floors have a different vibe to them. The 2nd floor is more for dining, the 3rd floor is a chill-out bar, and the rooftop is well, the funky rooftop for drinksThe food and drinks were all well received, no major complaints. Some reviews complain about the price, and you can dock them for value perhaps, but i don't see anything wrong with the other aspects. Besides, Singapore is a very expensive place to live in , in case some folks haven't notice

Enjoyed a burger with wings and corn on the cob here last week. The menu was creative and the food very tasty infused with regional / Indonesian spices. Burgers are very nicely proportioned (not too big/small). A group of 4 of us ate and had drinks on the roof top in the evening and open air with a cool gentle breeze
5
This is a very funky place. 2 cool bars and a casual dining restaurant. The tables are large and you need to co share. Burgers are amazing as are chicken wings and fries (sliced potatoes and in circular shape). Roof top bar is excellent to finish the night off.

Headed in for a Friday mid-afternoon lunch to Three Buns on Level 1. Absolutely no trouble finding a seat (dead quiet) amongst the quirky/funky setting, and - fortunately - the service reflected the love volume by being attentive if not a little personality-free.Immediate pet-hate - one toilet for the entire floor. No, not one for men and one for women - just one. At capacity, I could see this being a REAL challenge for everyone. Also, it was REALLY cold - reign in the aircon, guys.I ordered and destroyed the Burning Man (med-well, which they nailed) which was nothing short of a great burger. The right size, a great balance of ingredients which didn't explode all over you and it comfortably allowed you to wrap your hands around. A very solid burger experience. I also ordered fries which came with a chill and tomato sauce, and were some of the best fries I've had in a while.Drinks-wise, I had Tommy's Margarita - the first was VERY weak, but the second was much better(...pricey). My mate ordered a Sun Sun beer (can) which was way too expensive. They have nothing on tap which is a strange choice to make in Singapore, and no mainstream beers are available. They need to improve the selection overall here because offering two ales and a stout as your entire beer selection at a burger bar is idiotically limiting.The downside of the whole place is the pricing - it's outrageous for a burger joint, which is simply what it is - nothing more.After you add ++, the burgers range in the mid-$20s and don't come with fries (which, strangely, are reasonably priced). The range of burgers is great and as much as I'd like to try a couple of the others, it's simply too cost-prohibitive...and I'm a burger-fan!It's extremely unlikely that I'd go again based on cost alone. The bill for two burgers, four drinks and fries was just under $150 which is absolutely ridiculous for a burger joint, regardless of the hype.We proceeded to the rooftop for a few drinks to round out the night. It's quite small, but a great little spot. Prices are about right for Singapore (read: expensive), but the staff were cool, the setting great and the vibe well worth it.Overall, Potato Head a very hip place on the surface (I would like to head back and have a drink on the second floor Studio 1939 bar - nicely styled and stupidly stocker!) but it's very, very unlikely that I'd be paying for food again - regardless of how much I enjoyed it

Maybe there were too much hype or there are too much good dining options in Singapore but the burgers were okay. But if one needs to queue for it, then it is not worth waiting for it. The sides were a disappointment. The wings were ok and I had better chilli fries at a cheaper place. The aircon is too strong and the food got cold really fast. I quite like the buttermilk chicken burger but again, it got cold fast.

We dined as a group of 8 at Potato Head Folk last week. It was still relatively early in service (6.30pm) when we arrived, so the staff were able to give us all attention that we required.I had the 'Rambo' (Lamb Burger) to medium doneness. Whilst the burger isn't large, per se - it is a very rich dish, and had me satisfied. I enjoyed the cumin aioli, which I didn't hesitate in mopping up the excess with the 'Double Cooked Fries' I had as a side.I rolled my eyes at some of the complaints other reviewers have about things like the Tomato Sauce... if you're accustomed to supermarket condiments, don't order something that is clearly stated to be 'home made' and without preservatives...it WILL taste different. If you want to spend $15 on a meal, go to McDonalds and order an extra value meal. I think people can misunderstand the link between cost and quality ingredients/prep.However I am not without criticism. I was disappointed at the size of the white wine servings. It was the first thing I consumed at the restaurant before the other guests arrived, and my first impressions were of stinginess. Few places measure out their wine to exactly 150mL per glass, and it looked very much this way here...or the tumbler-style wine glasses are deceiving.Overall, we enjoyed the experience, and I would consider dining again, when weighing up food options in that area

I went last night to give it a try with my family and not impressed with the burger I had and my kids did not finished their burgers as well. My partner had the fish burger and left half in in the plate. Over the top with sauces! Corn on the cob, over cooked and sauces on top, nothing special. The tequila sunrise very average as well as the Tommy's margarita. All in all, very average and I wouldn't go back. The interior of the restaurant ok and the staff friendly but the burgers
3
Nice place, nice people, good mood. But service should improve. Give a plate for the burger please , don't forget the water. ..

We came here mid-week for a evening of burgers followed by cocktails in the upstairs bar for a friends birthday.In true potato head style they have created a playful and interesting decor style thats totally unique to your 'average' restaurant. The cocktails were fantastic and by the end of the meal everyone was very satisfied having completely polished off all the burgers and the sides!! I had their 'honky-tonk' chicken burger and loved the homemade sauce and slaw! Would recommend it and will be back to try some more soon!
5
I'm not sure why most people were complaining about this place but I had a great time when I was there! Perhaps I lucked out. We got there on a Friday at about 7pm as usual we had to wait for about an hour since they don't take reservations.It was okay with us as we could head up to the bar on the 3rd floor and ordered cocktails and some finger food while waiting for the arrival of our friends.We decided to dine there in the end because we thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, old New York bar feel with a modern twist. Cocktails were carefully crafted and tasted fantastic!! Burgers were smaller than we expected but they were awesome. Service was prompt, spontaneous and they are all a friendly bunch.I'm still puzzled by the rest of the reviewers. To me, I beg to differ, I had a great time!

I been having lunch with my girlfriend and we both get the same feeling about this place.Not much good things to say, just one actually!! the drinks were ok.About the bad things, is all the rest. They claim in the menu than the burger are medium doneness, and we request for medium rare, the waiter said than that is the doneness for their burghers, so ok.My couple ask for a coke, but everything is homemade, sauce, drinks, buns, etc, so we ask for two soft drinks than we can say than were good, the sauce was a homemade ketchup than they name by TOMs sauce, taste like tomato paste and sugar with vinegar, nothing special; and a home made chili sauce than taste like roasted peppers with garlic and some vinegar with sugar, no bad.The "ketchup" was moldy, and the burgers overcook -well done-, we ask for re-do it medium rare, so delays another 10-15min and at the end they were medium well, so we just eat them and ask for the bill. Price is astronomic for the size of the burger than barely takes 4 minutes to eat, due than they are just the burger, no sides at all.For two soft drinks and two burgers we paid more than $80. Welcome to Singapore Potato Head Folks

Made reservation for 4 people. Two work clients. Arrived on time. Waited 20 minutes as staff had lost booking. Arrived at 3rd floor and totally empty. No-one had left while we waited, all fuss and wasted our time. 10 minutes later 3 separate staff interupted us 1 minute apart each to apologise. 45 minutes later first drinks arrived. Moved to second floor, after huge fuss about getting our bill. Embarrassing.Ordered meals. 40 minutes later 3 of the 4 meals arrived. Seriously cold."Sorry, the gas bottle ran out." Oh dear. Still, begrudgingly took meals back. 20 minutes later 4 burgers finally arrived. TOTALLY OVERPRICED RUBBISH. MANY BETTER OPTIONS IN SINGAPORE.Music was great. Toilets we're clean. Exit was unobstructed. A quick exit the best part of this evening. Across the road to The Study, a great place to get over the tediousness of Potato Singapore. Bali works. This one doesn't. Even the waitress was complaining about how much it's slipped. So sad. The first few weeks perfect. Faded rose so fast

Friends were keen on trying the new place-to-be so we reserved a table for 6 at their bar - sorry no reservations for dinner. We were lead to a cosy corner with two 2 seater sofas with a table in between, when we pointed out that we had reserved for 6 we were politely informed that these were for 6, 3 on each side. I guess I could've done the math too, but couldn't picture 6 adults fitting in. So we asked for a side chair and were offered a stool. So be it. We asked for our names to be added to the dinner reservation. Everybody offered a different cocktail so we ended up trying 6 different ones, I felt that my friend's rum-based cocktail was the best. The Calcutta Sunset was too pink and didn't cut it, the whiskey with Absinthe was a bit too bitter, the gin one didn't make me happy either; the 2nd best was my friend's vokda which champagne. Each drink was in the $25 club. Keong Saik has undergone such a massive transformation that is now probably the street with the most expensive drinks!We ordered a cheese platter as most of the other bar snacks didn't appeal; the platter was by far the most over priced thing I've had in a long time. One hour on, after asking several staff whether our dinner table was available, we were finally led down to their 2nd floor restaurant which had some horrible decor - at least didn't cut it for me. They only serve burgers and one has to order fries on the side. The only reason I give this place a 3 star is for their lamb burger. Was good, juicy, tasty. The fries were average. The drinks menu at the restaurant was different from the bar upstairs, so we got a new round of drinks, most of us stuck to the usual spirits with mixers this time. Certainly won't be going back to this place in a hurry, in an effort to be cool they've gone the other way for me. At best, probably grab a burger at their take-away/sit by the road shop downstairs

Being a big fan of Potato Head in Bali, I was eagerly looking forward to trying their new establishment in Singapore that recently opened. The complex is on one of the new "foodie" streets in Singapore in an old building that has been beautifully restored inside. We dined at Three Buns which is the casual burger spot on the second floor of the building. The interior is beautifully decked out with a hipster, chic vibe that artfully molds the history of the building with the urban and youthful style that Three Buns is going for. This place has seemingly staked its reputation and cuisine on the good old fashioned hamburger joint so that's what we came for. The burgers did not disappoint, but you definitely pay a bit more for the quality as both me and my friend didn't find it good value for money and definitely overpriced by a few dollars (If the burger wasn't so damn tasty, you can beat I'd be more bothered by the price!). Premium price aside, it is one of the best burgers that I've had in Singapore. And what would a burger joint be without good fries. Three Buns has that covered as well, with a good selection of spuds and side items. I had the naughty fries which were fantastic: the cut on the fries, the fry and the toppings were tasty and well executed. Bravo!Here's where things start to go downhill though: the drinks. We both ordered the Sherbie Hancock (citrus sherbert lemonade) and the beverage was basically a terribly overpriced glass of flavored water that lacked any sweetness and tartness to it. The service here also needs significant work as it was terrible. We both found the staff that looked after us to be a grumpy, out-of-touch bunch that seemed like they absolutely did not want to be serving you at all and that you were somehow burdening them with your questions and requests. And when that final bill came, we both had some sticker shock. In sum, the burgers and fries are good and the atmosphere funky and fun, but that's where my praise for the place will stop. For the prices you pay and the lousy service you get, you should seriously be craving a good burger and fries because you'll need that craving to mentally get past the sticker shock and service standards you may experience at this place. I definitely look forward to another burger from here, but I'll probably just order takeaway next time if possible

Walked in and registered on the waitlist. Went up 3rd flr and got seated down and was told that a reservation was not confirmed and we were able to order drinks and food. We were in the midst of eating and the reservation turned up and it was messy! The service personnel were disorganized, was told to settle the bill and leave while we are eating. If this is the customer service by this restaurant, no matter what the hyped is, it is not worth it. I'd rather bring my money somewhere which is more worthy of it.

Love hanging out at the Potato Head bar (street level). This place has a different feel and vibe to it. And friendly staff too! Just what Singapore needed. I only wish their food and drinks would be better! Too much sauce in the burgers and only one choice of white wine which needs a LOT of ice to become drinkable.... all this at Singapore prices! Come on Potato Head, give us some quality, we'll love you even more
