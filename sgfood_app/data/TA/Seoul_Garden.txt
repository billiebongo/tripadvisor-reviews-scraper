Food is ok but the spread is little. Plus the pricing is expensive for the small range of food. It will be better to have steamboat with the same price but wider range.

Wide variety of choices to cater to seafood & meat lovers! Cooked finger food items that'll appeal to kids! Reasonable prices too!

I've been to this place thrice because of convenience but it was only on the third time that I liked it because I ordered Army Stew. Their seafood army stew was delicious. If i knew about it earlier, I'd prolly would've liked the place instantly.

Apparently their coffee machine was not maintain. Hot water became cloudy water.
Food and ambience was ok.

Limited food,not much selection however the service was good. Place a bit cramped but not crowded,so able to move freely

Ridiculous as they are steamboat cum BBQ buffet. The basic soup is require to pay.
Understand if we need to pay for the premium soup. Do they expect your customer to bring their own soup.

It's a Buffet, eat all you can Brothers and Sisters. Affordable and suitable for family especially when celebrating an occasion.

The restaurant was almost empty (weekday dinner), so we had no problems getting a table. The spread at this outlet was the same as the others, but the meat choices were slightly different and more uncommon. (eg. coffee or cha siew chicken) Some of the meats didn't have a nameplate in front of the bowl, we had to ask the waiter to put those up so we knew which meat was which. The dessert section also didn't have any nameplates. There were also a few nameplates in front of the wrong item.During the whole dinner, the waiters were either chatting amongst themselves, or in the kitchen. The empty plates on our table just kept piling up since nobody was clearing it. The veggies didn't look very fresh and they didn't really replenish any of the bowls.. Probably since there were not many customers that day. The meats were not as nice as those in the other outlets and had much more fats too. The grilling and soup area at our table was also smaller than what we had at other outlets. If you come in a big group, you might want to choose tables with more than one grilling area. One of the waiters was kind enough to help us take a group photo (birthday celebration).Overall, I would not recommend coming to this outlet

Seoul Garden is one of the halal certified joints in Singapore that carries a variety of meats and sides. For this joint, we had a hotpot barbeque lunch for 4. Advanced reservation is required for festive periods. 5 stars rating for staff politeness and efficiency of clearing plates quickly. Tour group friendly outlet. Saw some well-behaved guests from Myanmar. Overall, if it's casual then feast at Seoul Garden.

Food is good, variaty and delicious. The restaurant is small but beautiful and nice, I can find seafood hotpot, BBQ, rice, sushi... there. At the drink counter, we can do anything as a batender :)) just for fun, you can chosse cheese cake, sirup, soft drink. The cooker can do both BBQ and cook hot pot. There are table for about 4 people and you can be charge if you waste 100gr food so choose enoungh for eating
