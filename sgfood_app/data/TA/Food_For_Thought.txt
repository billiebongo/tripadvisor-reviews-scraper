Enjoyed the tea and cake at $10.70 after GST. No service charge. The afternoon set is not bad, somewhat the same price as compared to other cafes.

Really well executed valentines dinner with great tasting food. Had a very good experience and would visit again.
1
Really poor service, sign says wait to be seated, had to find member of staff and ask, waited at table had to ask for menu, staff ignored me, waited for 20 minutes they ignored me, rubbish service- don‚Äôt bother here
4
One of my favourite brunch spots to go too! Other than their affordable breakfast items, they have interesting local flavours such as Mee Siam Pasta which we enjoyed.
4
Good food with friendly staff but could do with me staff during lunch peak hours as we had remind them several times regarding our request for warm water and chilli sauce
3
Located within the museum, it‚Äôs a tranquil dining experience. Attentive n friendly service. Food is ok
2
A nice place to have a meal and hang out with friends. There was a party when I was there, so the "inside" seatings were reserved and we have to take an "outside" seating. Food portion was huge, but not really as nice as they look. Service was bad, no one really come to your table and you have to call out to them every time you needed somethin
4
It's nice to have brunch before or after visiting the museum. The restaurant is very cozy. However, the only down side is that it can be very bright because of the sunlight. Food and service was great. Been there twice and food quality remains the same. Oh, the food worth the value as well.
5
Food was excellent and it had a nice ambience! Service staff could do with a little more customer observation such as when to serve their main course and desserts or at least notice their customers. Staff were mostly run of the mill, not very friendly nor obnoxious. Some improvement there would be wonderful. Otherwise, a very good place to eat at
4
Quite a frequent visitor to this cafe/bistro as I stop by for a latte while visiting the museum on weekdays. It‚Äôs a perfect pit stop after a quiet walk around the place.This time around, I went on a Sunday morning for brunch at 11:30am. Initially we had wanted to do like brunch food like eggs or pancakes etc, but the Mee Siam pasta was calling out to me so we ordered that. And since we were throwing our minimal carbo diet into disarray, we ordered the curry fried chicken and fries as well!The Mee Siam pasta is renowned and it was yummy enough! Chilli lovers might find it a tad tame though. The fried curry chicken was crunchy and they used thigh meat so it‚Äôs juicy. Fries hot and crispy!Nothing mind blowing but that‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre attempting to achieve anyways!Service was friendly and sincere. They do try hard to get to everyone during busy times. All in all, it‚Äôs a very lovely place to sit and have a meal in air conditioned comfort while still enjoying the sun under the museum‚Äôs massive glass ceiling!
5
Located inside the museum. Peaceful and bright. Excellent service with all servers with a smile and serving promptly. Recommended for a place to chill.
4
Too sunny on a hot day, but the food and ambience were great! In fact, the place was packed so it‚Äôd be good to make a reservation.
2
Delicious food, but became a terrible experience due the service. Either they don't have ANY training, or simply they don't care for customers... maybe a combination for both. Shame.
4
Damn this was a big plate of wholesome goodness. Very filling, & imho good value for money. Delicious & I would order this again üëç
5
I really likes the ambience there and the food was great! Went there for a birthday celebration and they have large tables.
3
Though my dish of pesto salmon tasted quite good, it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t spectacular. Still it was much better than what my friends thought of their dishes so I was glad I ordered it. The salmon was done just right and the pesto was tasty. The food was expensive though for this kind of place
3
Accessible, pleasant in-museum spot with a varied, reasonably-priced menu of both western and local dishes. I had a local chicken soup with vermicelli, and my husband had a cheeseburger! Food is well prepared and service is pleasant. Seating in courtyard area is lovely on a cloudy day, as you feel as if you are outside but don't have the sun beating down on you. There is also dining space without the glass roof, so no need to be hot even when the sun is beating down
3
After a year from our last visit to Singapore we returned to this restaurant , after a good experience last time. To start with service was very slow, if you wait where it says "Wait to be seated" you could be waiting a long time, do as the Singaporeans do and ignore this. Service did pick up, which was surprising as the restaurant got busier. The restaurant is in a great spot and could be something really special if a little more effort was made
1
The place is lovely and beautiful. The food is above average but I will never come back here again because of the attitude of those who works here. When I came in I had to find my own table. When I went up to the counter to ask for a menu that should be presented but wasn't, the staff was doing a very ill face and shouted to another employee to get a menu. The menu was thrown down on our table and no one came back to take the order. I went up to the counter again now another employee was making a terrible facial expression and yelled at the same employee to get the order. When the food came, it was thrown on the table again. I don't normally make a bad review but this place is an exception
3
Location: it is integrated with national museum building. Easy to find. Food on menu: western style food, light finger food, cakes, beer, coffee, tea. You can settle a meal here or a light coffee break. Price: reasonable. I order a carrot cake SGD7/slice , and iced lemon tea(with white wine) SGD8. Food portion is just nice for one person. Food taste is good. Service : the waiters here move a little slow and not really pay attention to customer. I wait more than 10mins to have my order done and it took another 10mins to serve on my table. This happened to most of the customer today. I was here doing my paperwork, so able to observe over a period of 2hours. It is not a place for a quick meal, if you can't tolerate slow service, better skip. If you in no hurry and need a relaxing place for meal, this place fits you well.
4
Had a quick snack there in late August with friends. I loved the mushroom soup. The other light finger food was just as tasty. Had a tight schedule that day...otherwise would have loved to try the other food. Ambience is great too.
3
Food generally was alright but the braised beef tasted like it was defrosted and put in the refrigerator to be heated up. Staff was otherwise understanding and replaced the dish with a dessert.
4
Always a good option for a simple, quick, fuss-free meal in a quiet setting! The food is also affordable and above average. Highly recommended!
3
We had a breakfast set, nutella banana pancakes, and garlic flavoured fries! Tho the fries were addictive, the flavour of the garlic was too mild to be fully savoured. That being said however, the breakfast set and pancakes were pretty satisfactory.
5
We visit the National Museum every time we spend time in Singapore. And we eat at Food for Thought after spending time in the Museum. It‚Äôs a dependable stop, with very pleasant and efficient waitresses, an airy feel, pleasantly air conditioned, a relaxed atmosphere and serving good food.On this occasion we both had the Black Pepper Beef Linguine and coffee. The meal was substantial and the coffee good. At S$46 it‚Äôs not cheap, but you are also paying for the service and location. Thoroughly recommended
5
What better place to catch up with friends, especially at a restaurant in the museum. Sitting at the historic glass atrium, savoring great food and catching up looks like the best combo. Mee Siam pasta is great - uniquely Singapore. The curry fried chicken cutlet tastes quite different from the usual chicken cutlet too. Cakes and muffins are 'yummilicious' too. Love the hot chocolate with mesh mellows! Best treat in the afternoons. I like it that this restaurant is owned by a social enterprise chain. Value-based consumerism for a change!
4
The ribs and salmon were delicious. Although the ribs was a significantly larger portion than the salmon. Loved the baked potato sides too. Had the ice cream sandwich earlgrey flavour, the ice cream was delish! I find the lemon sandwich a little too sweet but hubby loved it. My 8mo loved the openess of the place. Kid friendly place
4
I love this place such that I went on two consecutive weekends! I've always love Food for Thought when they were at Queen's Street. But the current location at national museum is even more awesome. Will be good if the food and coffee could maintain the high standards they used to have, seem to have dipped a little from those days when they were at Queen's Street.
2
Was here for the youth 1-4-1 promotion but they told me that the milkshake were sold out. Their staffs are not attentive and it takes ages to catch their attention. Their plain watwr have got black things in it. I drank only a cup and realised it. Didnt bother to inform the staff as they were not available anyway. Food is not fantastic so sorry but i Will never visit again.
4
My company chose this restaurant as we wanted to give support to the social enterprise eateries such as Food for Thought, known for its scrumptious all-day breakfasts.I loved the high ceiling of the museum! Would have loved to sit at the foyer area which was nice & bright but has small round table settings only.Food was excellent and we didn't have to wait very long for all the food to be served.A definite recommendation to dine in within the National Museum
1
Cold latte, Full breakfast work was horrible. Came cold and the bacon was so gamy smell.
Mushroom taste funny
4
Live the ambience, most suitable for Sunday brunch. Food is delicious. Staff is friendly and usually quite responsive.
5
Food was promptly served & we were greeted by friendly staff upon entry to the restaurant :) very good service!
4
We went on a public holiday to have lunch. Main course serving size is adequate for a hungry stomach! We had the burgers & fries and full works- all day brunch. As for side dish (mix platter for 2) I find the portion slightly little. I love the enviroment: basking under natural sunlight in national musuem (air conditioned) and having lunch! Spacious area for prams and baby chairs (We had a pram and 2 baby chairs to our tables). Overall a great experience to have lunch and appreciate arts thereafter :)
2
Perhaps we were just not lucky, but our lunch there was a total disaster. Two overwhelmed your girls were floating around (and it was not even full as we came there very early for lunch) - but it took some 10 minutes before we even got the menus. I had a Ceaser's Salad - that came roughly 5 minutes after everybody elses food. The chicken was raw! When I asked if I could have it grilled a bit more, I was told that this is "how it should be". Well I'm not a fan of salmonella, so I insisted and had it send it back to the kitchen to be grilled again. Came back after another 10 minutes (everybody else had already finished) and - it was still raw. Didn't eat it in the end. To get the bill took another 100 years - and overall: I would not recommend to anybody to have lunch there. If you need to sit down after visiting the Museum: grab something to drink
3
Nice open setting inside the museum, friendly service and a variety of snacks and meals - the coffee was good and the snacks fresh - varied menu from ice cream sandwiches to pizza and burgers - prices average for this type of venue - handy for a sit down break whilst visiting an awesome museu
4
Food here is good, those charges quite a bit. I tried their Laksa Egg Benedict here, which is a funny combination of poached egg, luncheon meat and Laksa Hollandaise.Service there depends on who serves you. Some are good, and some are just so-so. They don't charge service charge, so you can give your tips in accordance with your experience
3
Went here with my friends. The only thing that we enjoyed was the ambience and the company and the ice cream cookies. Coffee was ok. Pancake was so so. the banana tasted the aroma of a garlic which we suspected it was sliced at the same chopping board and/or the knife where they crashed garlic! The Full Works came within average as well. The salad wasn't fresh. Overall they can improve their dishes.
2
Food was extremely disappointing. Flavours were insufficient, and the portions were sad particularly the snack platter for 2. Service was also relatively slow, not sure if it was because we had an early reservation at 1030 am, but we had to get all cutleries and serviettes ourselves.
5
I loved the branch at Botanic Gardens and FFT @ National Museum give a different vibes but it's still awesome. Food's great. Menu is different from the one at Botanic Gardens. I like that it has a variety of food. It's a good place to just chill and catch-up with friends. Will definitely come back here again
3
Food was decent. Kids enjoyed their kids meals. Service staff didn't seem very attentive. Asked for warm water three times before it was served. But overall a warm environment and decent place to bring the kids.
4
Pleasant venue inside National Museum of Singapore. Good food, Some interesting items we have not tried before, like the cauliflower 4-ways.
5
The service was good but the food was a little to salty than usual. We love the overall ambience as we had a little celebration and our guests enjoyed the overall experience.
4
Very polite service, good variety of food. Cool water and fine food. Embedded in a special surrounding like the Museum, this is a good place to relax.
4
Circular tables make it good for groups of about 4 to 5. Food was well presented and tasty, albeit a bit too tasty. Had the beef linguine and the hamburger and fries. Spam fries were pretty interesting too. Coffee was decent. Would recommend venue.
3
Food was good. Booking remarks wasn't taken into consideration. The least the staffs could do was to inform me they're unable to provide me the sitting I wanted. But nothing was mentioned. As if they didn't know about my request.
3
We were in the museum and wanted to have lunch, the space is nice and bright, the service friendly. The Asian-inspired food is of average quality. It served well the purpose of eating reasonably and quickly and concluding the visit of the museum.
3
Located inside the National Museum, this cafe is a pleasant break from the heat and bustle of midday Singapore. The menu is quite limited, but it is fine for coffee or tea with a snack. Sometimes difficult to find a table, especially on school holidays and weekends
3
Had Valentine's day dinner menu on Valentine's day. First dish appetizer was a mini crab meat paste which was not bad. Second dish was Smoked sword fish salad, the salad was nice but the sword fish was rather hard. Main dish was Salmon and Braised Wagyu Beef, the Salmon was soft and nice with a crunchy feel on the skin and the braised wagyu beef was soft and tender too. The cleanser was alright. However, the dessert Marshmallow chocolate cate wasn't that great and It was quite hard too
2
I don't mind that the food is so-so and a little pricey, but I do expect better service. The food was slow in coming out of the kitchen and the check was also abig wait. The setting of the restaurant inside the museum is nice though and that is what lures in the customers.If I were to go back, I would just stop there for coffee and maybe ice cream, but not a meal. Singapore has so many other places to eat with low cost and delicious food
4
Good food, X'mas music from the flute quartet in the museum lobby and bright sunshine flooding the entire place made this the ideal lunch spot on Xmas Day. A long waiting time for food to arrive pulled it down to a 4 star rating.
5
Accommodate big groups. Staff friendly. Food reasonably priced. Enjoyed our experience there. Will go back again.
1
Some of the most inedible food I've ever not eaten. Service poor. Coffee stale. Food came from a packet.
3
this branch has limited seats. service is slow. food looks good but does not taste as good. can be improved
2
Having lunch here spoiled the museum visit. There were a fair number of tables occupied when we arrived. The menus were brought promptly but no water was offered. Other tables had water. Eventually our order was taken. After half an hour my burger arrived. It was ok but nothing to make you want more. My wife did not receive her cappuccino at all. Her order of pancakes had not arrived after my completion of the hamburger. We called the waiter who said it was on its way. If the truth be known we think he failed to put the order through. After a further wait and us berating the staff it came. She ordered ice cream and no cream well it came with cream. At this point my wife was livid. We offered to pay for my meal only and after much fuss we were glad to be out of there
4
We had lunch here. Mushroom soup, Chicken Caesar salad, Chilean Sea Bass: all good. Ice Cream Sandwiches: delicious. Cafe Lattes: strong but good. Service was mediocre. Waiters had to be asked to take orders, and had to be asked to bring some water to drink. They did not know anything about another restaurant at the National Museum that was all of 100 yards away
1
food:portion of the food was so small and quality was so bad. ordered a variety of food for adults and kids. kids mushroom pasta had so much garlic that my kid refuses to eat. the fried food was the worst I've come acrossed. it was so oily that my husband and I felt really sick in out stomach.service:its the general below average service. we asked for a table for 3 adults and 2 kids. the waiter walked around the cafe and came back to us saying that there are no table for us and right in front of us was 2 smaller tables where we could join the tables to accommodate us. so we had to suggest this to the waiter...
2
I have previously been to Food For Thought but it was years ago and always remembered how great their pancakes was. Well, their pancakes are still amazing as I remembered but the service is lacking. Water jug was given without glasses, soup was served without cutleries. All of these basic services had to be requested for and it was so difficult to get a hold of the waitress attention . I was not even looking for extraordinary service, such where the waitress talks to you with a smile. While their menu looks good and pancakes were good as well, service is always key to me. Felt like hawker centre service which is disappointing considering this outlet is in the National Museum where most tourists are
2
Wishing to rest my weary feet after walking around the Museum for a couple of hours, I decided to have afternoon tea at this on-site coffee shop.It was quite crowded, however a rather glum faced young man who was waiting on the tables pointed to an empty table and I sat down. Unsmiling, and without any acknowledgement, he took my order of a Mango Smoothie (S$6++) and a Cranberry and Raisin Scone (S$4++). The Mango Smoothie was quite nice, however the scone was very dense and not very enjoyable.I really wished that I hadn't stopped there and hope that the young man's attitude was just because he was having an 'off' day.
2
This branch is at a pretty cool location, got a seat quite quickly however, the menu was pretty disappointing. The food that I wanted to order was unavailable and I ordered the basic works instead. My friend wanted a banana smoothie but that was unavailable as well. The food arrived after quite a long wait but the meal that I had was pretty mediocre. My friend's Ham burger and fries was undercooked but when she wanted to order the nutella pancakes, they didn't have any bananas, so we left instead. I was quite disappointed with the food but the service and the location was okay
5
Service provided was prompt and the staff always have a friendly smile when they are providing the service. Will definitely return once again.
4
Their all day brunch menu items are good! and side dishes like Ma Ling Luncheon Meat thick cut fries are worth a try too!
4
Nice and cozy section of the National Museum. Great place to catch up with friends over afternoon tea. Food is well-portioned; the bandung drink was really nice!
4
When looking for a restaurant nearby the national Museum, I choose this one as it is located inside the area. The place is nice, simple and airy. I have green salad with portobello and tofu and pumpkin soup, Both are taste good.
5
Popped in on Sunday afternoon with a five-year old, we were looking for a place to sit and have a drink.
We had special requests, and the waiter smiled through all of them, and delivered.
Thank you
4
The name of the restaurant is nice and fits will with its location, in the National Museum. The food we had was tasteful. The staff was helpful.
1
Very bad experience all round. Only one waitress for entire external seating area working to take orders serve seat arriving guests provide menu etc. I had to walk over to get my own menu. When I ordered the butterscotch Xmas drink, they didn't even tell me they could not deliver my drink until I asked for it half hour later. Reason is the syrup or mix was not ready frozen or something. No service. And not even a thank you after I paid my bill. They didn't even say it nicely when they don't accept amex cards. Nice museum surroundings but that is all you should hope for. Food sucks, the wagyu and mash potatoes were mushy and hard to swallow. The mushroom salad was soury weird tasting to our liking
4
Enjoy a delicious lunch in a charming museum setting! We were greeted by a friendly and cheerful waitress who showed us to our table. Our order was taken quickly and the wait for our lunch wasn't long. We both enjoyed a pasta dish and some soft drinks (note that the burgers are only available on weekdays). A lovely place to have lunch after exploring the museum
4
This is at the National Museum. After a long day of walking stepped in for a quick meal around 3 pm. Got a table quickly, nice bright setting under the high roof of the beautiful museum building. Small menu, and not everything was available. We had the wagyu beef salad, two types of pancakes, fries, ice cream and sodas. Food was tasty and came out quickly, so can't complain. Service was adequate - this is a cafe, so can't expect fine dining service. Good value for money. Eat here if you are at the museum, and are looking for quick and fuss free food
3
Lunched here during our museum visit yesterday. The BBQ pork ribs, and the crispy chicken curry were both fantastic; flavoursome and plentiful. It did take an age to get our order in though, and staff seemed to stand about not knowing exactly what to do. Nice beer though and coffees afterwards, although a bit disappointed that it cost an extra dollar to get a de-caffeinated coffee. Shelves of books to borrow and read whilst you eat, but a bit echoee with the high roof,and limited atmosphere. Could do with a few potted trees around to break up the starkness. Food wise it's at least a 4 star, but other things bring it down a tad. Perfectly reasonable for a quick lunch though
5
These cafes in public buildings can be very overpriced and poor quality, but not Food for Thought. Reasonable prices for food and alcohol, good service and the food was nice. Much better than the awful Pollen in the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay.
2
Service was terribly slow may be due to the private event happening. And the food was what I can term as ok for a place I used to rave about. May be it's time to reboot the menu and retrain the staff?
4
We did and loved it as a light lunch whilst visiting the National Museum of Singapore. Lovel light, airy setting with a range of interesting menu choices.
4
Nice cafe/restaurant inside the National Museum. Limited menu with tasty dishes. Friendly staff. Suitable for coffee or dinner after a museum visit. I would probably not come here without a museum visit first, just for the restaurant.
2
Nice place if you can sit outside their cafe. Beef hamburger, however, was very very average. Chicken burger rated a 3.5/5 from my son :). Service was poor. Confused and delayed. Only found one member of staff who was friendly.
3
Convenient stop for local fusion food at reasonable prices.Look out for their set meal options for lunch or tea. They also serve all day breakfast with a local twist e.g. light and fluffy buttermilk pancakes with gula melaka instead of the expected maple syrup.A fan favourite is the pulled pork burger which is served with a generous chicken caesar salad and home made iced tea. Great value for money. Overall, a family friendly place with a simple menu. Avoid peak hours as service can be slow
3
Delicious food, generous servings in an informal setting within the museum. There is an area for kids to be engaged in table activities. However, service was very slow: tables were cleared at an agonizing pace. Dishes slow to be served. Quite a bit waiting to get a table. Wait staff appeared to be a little lost and disorganized
4
There's something very Bostonian about the whole Singapore museum and the little cafe Food For Thought adds that sense of chic and style into eating within a museum ambience. Young waiters and waitress are on hand to serve, and there's a delightful menu to please the palate. The slow roasted pulled pork burger was magnificent as was the coffee. You can also indulge in soups and salads, side snacks, all day items, pasta, noodles and burgers. For the busy mum, there's plenty to keep the kids occupied- the Singapore museum has many colouring kits at hand for them to keep their hands and minds busy. There's also colouring sheets available here. Brilliant idea!!
1
Do not go to this place if you actually want to eat or talk to the people you are with. Staff are clearly trained to never look at a table or to provide any kind of service. To top it, 45 minutes after placing our order, still no food. They had clearly forgotten my order but just kept telling me it's on the way and then walking the opposite direction to the kitchen. After an hour of waiting, I finally cancelled my order. They somehow looked shocked! Following that not even a sorry, or offer of an olive branch. Bearing in mind we had to get our own jugs of water, our own condiments, and even find menus ourselves as staff are so poor, it's shocking that this place has a tip jar at the front. Oh, and the $4 lemongrass tea - a small cup of hot water with no flavour.
5
The airconditioning and my unconditional taste for sweets brought me to the inner restaurant of The National Museum of Singapore.The waitress advised me to take the coffee and cake (special price before 6pm).The chocolat cake was very good. 8 dollars with the coffee !
5
Lovely food and great place for gathering. They have a room with facilities for a gathering. Booking is easy. The minimum spending for this room is S$300. Quite easy to reach if about 10 persons each other a main and a drink. Lovely service.
3
We got chicken amd lemongrass orders for 7 British poinds each which were really tasty.salad a bit uninspiring,just peaves and cherry tomatoes.Chips very nice though.Had some lemongrass tea to go with it.
5
We went for dinner and the place is not full at all. We ordered sandwich and a pasta dish. The food is delicious in decent portion and the price is decent. The setting is nice inside the museum with tall ceiling. Very nice place.
2
There's not a wide variety on this menu but all of us managed to find something we liked. The food was pretty decent. The service was a let down. It took us a long time to get their attention to order. After that, it took a long time to get their attention for the bill. Managed to catch the eye of a staff walking past very quickly, she - would you believe it - said "sorry" with a wave of her hand and kept right on walking to seat some patrons. Fair enough, she was busy, but then - would you believe it again - she didn't come back to us ever!! So, after several minutes, we managed to get the attention of another staff, and he quickly came and placed the bill on our table, and quickly left. Again, no staff around to take the payment. I was getting tired of trying to get attention, so I removed my credit card, and placed cash, then brought bill and money to the cashier. The guy who had earlier passed us the bill was standing near the cashier. He took the bill and money from me WITHOUT EVER LOOKING AT ME, no eye contact, NOT A WORD, he couldn't even muster a thank-you.Seriously, with this service level, the food had better be very good. I was deciding between a score of one or two. Decided on two as the food was passably decent
5
I've visited this place twice over the past month and i really love it. The portions were generous and i like seating outside whereby there's a little sun. Menu selections were sufficient and i just couldn't get enough of the Horlicks Milkshake!They can also accommodate big groups and reservations are recommended. Service was prompt and friendly.Definitely worth a visit. Affordable dining at a very touristy spot :
3
I have been to all the Food For Thought outlets. The menu is pretty simple. Pancakes and scrambled eggs with plenty of sides as add-on. The basic work comes with bacon and toasted brioche along with a large serving of scrambled eggs. The full works comes mushrooms, tomatoes, hash browns, sausages and bacon.They do have a after 11am menu on top of the all day breakfast menu. Pastas, rissoto, fish & chips and burgers. Their dark chocolate pancakes is nice. Simple works might not fill you up so go for full works if you're super hungry. The sambal fried potatoes was impressive. You may pair it up with basic works. The risotto was pretty average and serving was too small. The dark chocolate and milo latte are quite unique and certainly a must-try drink. The service was oscillating between being attentive and intrusive. Guess the waiters and waitress were new. Price was on the high side for the quality and quantity of food that was served
4
At first, it looks as if it just has outside seating, but there is plenty of room indoors. Pricing is the best I've found at a tourist venue. Not hard really, make attractions affordable and don't gouge through food pricing. The wifi is better than the museum wifi
4
A few little tables are set out on the marble floor of the cross-corridor, and suddenly you have a cafe. The ceiling soars so high you might as well be outside. It is raining outdoors but there is plenty of light inside. I had a pulled pork sandwich with fries, and my husband had fish and chips. Sounds like mundane food, but it was excellent, gourmet, and beyond our expectations.
5
When one goes to a museum does not expect the best restaurant in town on the premises; but this one is better than expected, good service, good food; my wife took a basic breakfast, with a coffee way above average, than a souffl√É¬© of potatoes and mushroom, I took a beefsteak with crispy salad and than an excellent desert with banana and nuts; what a treat :)The museum looked better after this meal..
4
Visited for a quick bite during a museum trip. Although we were tempted by the breakfast, there happened to be a brunch promotion. Angus T-Bone Steak Brunch Platter ($40):500g Grain-fed Australian Angus T-Bone (on the bone)Sunny Side Up Eggs with Laksa Leaf Soy DrizzleRoasted potatoes (Rosemary and Garlic)Grilled Tomato (Thyme)Side SaladThe steak was well-cooked to order (medium rare) and the order arrived very quickly in spite of the bustling lunch crowd. Eggs were done nicely, with oozy, runny yolks, and the potatoes were very flavourful.The platter was enough for two people to share. 10/10 would order again!The restaurant provides free flow table water at no charge, neither do they charge GST (they do charge for service, though).Portions at FFT tend to be on the MASSIVE side, so do take a look around at other diners' meals to get a good sense of what you'll be up against
3
Pretty expensive Caff√® with small tables. Tea $7, cheese cake $13. Good to refill yourself while exploring museums.
1
Not opened, closed for renovations with no warning anywhere even on their official web site I had been told to be sure to put this on must visit list. Long hot trip by public transport all a waste of time very unimpressed
4
Nice Mantou Platter, so full of Peranakan flavour. üëç
Good place to rest your leg n tuck in to some local delights or western food after visiting National Museum.
4
This is the second Food for Thought we have visited. This time we only had coffee. It is in a pleasant part of the museum. Great for sipping coffee and people watching.
4
Came here for breakfast. The food was pretty good. Certainly the food and atmosphere was much better than the branch they have at the Botanical Gardens. I would have no problem coming back here again. I don't think its cheap though, parking is quite limited and the museum was not that interesting
4
I like the branch at the botanic gardens for its location and parking. My usual is the pancakes with banana and walnuts and what is unique is that it comes with gula melaka (local brown sugar molasses) rather than maple syrup. Pancakes are well cooked amd fluffy and each serving is a stack of 3
4
The location of this Food for Thought inside the National Museum is classy and sophisticated. We entered the Museum from the entrance closest to the cafe and immediately decided that we would have a cup of coffee there after touring the exhibits.The staff were very professional and the coffee excellent. We had some muffins which were lovely and really enjoyed the atmosphere.I was intrigued by the Earl Grey milkshake and so ordered one. It was lovely and such a unique flavour.While not cheap the prices were entirely reasonable for the quality of the surroundings and the food

Nice atmosphere - quite a unique location inside the museum, and the coffee was good, and served in a generous sized cup. I ordered a cranberry and raisin scone with my coffee. The scone itself was ok but the cream and jam that accompanied it were vile. The cream was so sickly sweet and unnatural tasting that I had to scrape it off before finishing. The jaw tasted like cheap sugar and preservatives and not the quality preserve you expect with a scone.

My family and i had just visited the LKY exhibition at the National Museum when we were thinking hard for a dinner spot this part of Orchard Road. We decided not to walk out and instead settled for Food for Thought and it was a really good decision on hindsight. The 3 of us ordered Fish & Chips $18, Chicken Linguine $18 and Baby Ribs $22. There are plenty of options including all day breakfast from $9 and localised items such as laksa pasta and some sinful looking burgers too. One thing I don't understand - why would they stop serving burgers from 5pm onwards? Anyway small eaters might wana note that the portion are actually quite generous and u can add ask to add on items separately such as the butter brioche $2 each, fries and drinks. The F&C was quite good and we loved the batter especially. The dessert menu wasn't very comprehensive but it didn't need to be. The promotion for the month was 2 slices of butter brioches served with a generous wallop of vanilla ice cream with a home made berries sauce. It was simple, delicious and satisfying. The place doesn't charge service charge which was another plus and yet the service was friendly and pretty timely too. Do leave some tips if you appreciate the guys here.

The Lee Kwan Yew Exhibition is on at the National Museum and Food for Thought restaurant looks a nice cozy lunch spot just before going up to the Exhibition. It did not disappoint! I was very happy with the menu choice, the service and the coffee. As a late addition we ordered a slice of suggee cake..also delightful. It suits western taste buds although they have a few fusion sort of meals too. We liked the all day breakfast optio
