With the new year comes new resolutions, and with that healthy eating. The fish and salad option here is pretty decent, albeit at CBD prices; had a dory and 2 portions of salad for $11.40.

Service was fast and the salad were food. Has their basic roast with 2 salad. The chicken was done perfect, not too dry and not overdone. It's just nice. Coupled with the greens, filling at the end

Visited the outlet at Robinson Rd again for lunch recently with a friend. Opted for a small salad and a soup. Food was fine, although the soup was a little too salty for my liking. Service was fairly unenthusiastic.

This place is amazing to go for lunch when I am watching my diet. They do some lovely salads and serve with protein. My go-to lunch favourites are the salmon with the mushroom in sesame sauce and broccoli salads on the side. I hear people say it is a bit pricy, but i think you pay for the quality of food, which is very good here

I found their Marina bay link mall outlet while going from Downtown MRT towards Raffles area and thought of giving them a try instead of going to my regular salad place. Turns out it wasn't a very good idea. The food is more expensive than other very popular salad chains nearby and even the portion is less, besides the fact that the staff wasn't very helpful/friendly. I don't see any reason to go back again

Had a take-away salad regular size (3 servings); regular price in the SGD 10 - 11 range. Chose two greens, which yielded about 1.5 leaves of a normal sized romaine lettuce each - one came with pieces of bread, soaked in some creamy salad dressing, one had half a cherry tomato in it. Recognizing that this would not sustain me for the afternoon, I thought I needed something else of substance. I chose the mushrooms, which did however attract a SGD 1.5 or so extra charge. I left paying almost SGD 12 for two 2 x 2 x 1.2 inch compartments of green leaves, which came without dressing (if there was dressing, nobody behind the counter bothered to ask) and a compartment of mushrooms (okay taste). In the end, I even needed to ask where to find a fork. This is rubbish. Never again

Had lunch a couple of times at raffles place outlet. John Dory fish was amazingly cooked, juicy and tender! Love the broccoli side dish, perfectly light seasoning that goes well. Chicken breast however does not have consistent taste to it, first time I ate was really yummy and soft. The second time, the chicken was really dry and tough to eat! Broccoli too were tasteless. Perhaps because the second time was dinner hour and the food have already been cooked and left out for too long. First visit was lunch hour

@ Paya Lebar Centre located opposite the Mrt. Had this chicken with rosti lunch set. Added salad as the display of it looks tempting. Portion of lunch is huge especially chicken breast. Rosti was too oily to my liking. Although expensive but quality is there. Salad is as good as it looks

Located along the busy Robinson road, just about a 5minute walk from Raffles Place. Even on a very hazy day, I managed to get here with my N95 and it wasn't too difficult to navigate my way there.This seems to be one of their biggest outlets with ample seating area. The dining area looked neat and clean. As I walked in I noticed a staff talking on the phone non stop, and even when I left he was still on his phone. Not exactly sure what he was talking about as he was speaking in his native language. But it was slightly annoying, as you could hear the staff talking nonstop. He only stopped talking when he was collecting money.Step 1. Pick a proteinI picked Chicken leg as my side.Step 2. Pick your sidesFor sides, I decided to skip the carbs and go for wild mushrooms and broccoli. The broccoli came with toasted almond flakes which was a nice treat!The wild mushrooms were surprising juicy and I enjoyed it. The chicken was very tender and juicy and the skin was so crispy. They roasted the chicken so well that all the fats in between the skin and the meat melted away

There are a lot of salad places in downtown area. This is my favorite. Everything is fresh and the sauce is good. Love the walnut chicken , soba, all other vege. The hot dish also quite good . The dining area is quite small as lot of people just take away . Good place to try . Very busy during lunch time .
