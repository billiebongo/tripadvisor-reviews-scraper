Excellent Shanghainese food which is delicious and fresh. Enjoyed the live music as well. Will come here again.

Appropriate to bring my guests from Shanghai to lunch at Grand Shanghai.They were very much impressed by the interior grandeur setup of yester years and find it most charming. Needless to say the food was of excellent quality and service was topmost..

Old style classic high roof colonial building. The food is very good but the dish size is small. Reasonable service and a jazz ensemble plus vocalist to keep you company

location is good, service is not bad, ambiance is great.the problem here is the quality of food - can be impoved on and its time to renovate the place! this place has so much potential! and please dont sing the same songs over and over.performers should perform till late , like 12am-1am , 10pm is way too early

The restaurant is located close to town with easy access via public buses. It also has ample underground parking which is complimentary for customers. The restaurant design is influenced by Shanghainese Lounges of the mid 1900s with a live band playing chinese classics and the occasional birthday song. In terms of food, the restaurant excels in imparting traditional chinese flavours into its dishes. There is a wide variety on the menu and the staff will be happy to recommend their favourite dishes and desserts. Overall, this restaurant is highly recommeded for anyone who would like authentic chinese food with the atmosphere and ambience of old Shanghai

The restaurant is quite large and have Chinese live signing in the evenings. They have many large round tables for 15-20 people. We tried a lot of dishes with the streamed fish, gong bao chicken and the soups being the best. Tastes were better than average.m and service was o

I was here twice. One for lunch, in a separate room reserved for us (it was a work event), and one for dinner with a large group.The main difference between lunch and dinner was the presence of a group playing and singing live music.The place is nice and a lot of attention is paid even to details. The staff is extremely polite.As I was not paying I have no precise idea of the prices.Regarding the food quality I must say that it is good, but nothing really astonishing. Overall, it is not a bad place for a luinch or dinner, but for sure I wouldn't consider it as a "top destination" in a city as Singapore

We had 2 tables for dinner to celebrate a birthday. David, likely the manager, took our orders. We would have appreciated a little more patience. The "lion head" dish was well recommended. The roast chicken well done but didn't have a wow factor. The shredded chicken with ham & tofu was delightful. We had live singing entertainment from the stage. However our 2 requested Chinese songs given to david were not sung. Sigh.
4
Had a lovely evening at the restaruant. Food was good and we enjoyed the live band and old songs. The decor of the place had a different feel. The service was good and we had our own room as we had a large group of us. Nice experience.
4
We were there for dinner and they have stage performance . Food was nice plus great ambiance and good company.
4
Nice decorated Shanghai setting. Good service from staff who were courteous and professional. They were knowledgeable about the menu and were able to recommend popular dishes to patrons
4
My favourite dish is the bee hoon with crab / prawns.
The seafood is fresh and the bee hoon enough "oohmm".
The sauce is not too thick or starchy and enough wok hei.
4
Consistently good quality Chinese cuisine. Staff very attentive and helpful. Excellent Restaurant Manager

Wow, when I step into the restaurant it gives me a Grand feeling as if I'm in the olden days Shanghai. Like the setting and the backdrop of the stage. Beautiful Chandlers. The serving ladies was thoughtful, ask whether I like some hot tea or warm water while waiting. Food wise, only the braised Towkwa appetizer was yummy, the rest of the dishes mediocre.

Grand Shanghai Nice looking Chinese restaurant with old style decor. It gives a lavish grand kind of feeling it almost feels like walking onto a movie set. Really back to the golden old days that gives a very reflective grand shanghai Asian retro kind of sense. Food and services was average I wouldn't say its sensation but it's OK. I'm certainly not overly inspired. The interesting experience is that there is a singer and live band. They play, from what I was told, really old Chinese standards - I think from the 30's or 40â€™s. I would recommend a visit, just to enjoy the ambience and performance

What a truly elegant 5 star Chinese restaurant. The decor is decadent and stylist ..... with chandeliers, a stage with a band and solo singer, plush booths and split level floors with pillars, creating a theatrical coliseum type grand restaurant of time gone by. The food and choice of food is unmatched, with impeccable wait service and hospitality. You must book ...... and while we were the only westerners in the restaurant, we were not made to feel uncomfortable and were politely forgiven for any cultural unawareness we had. Only order one dish at a time .. finish that then order again and so on until your full. A wonderfully memorable evening to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.

I went there yesterday with my family for new year dinner.The foods standard have drop.The Salmon Yu Sheng so so.The Shark's Fin with Crabmeat alot of starch.The stewed duck come out very cold but they say is like that,Shanghai stewed duck is cold.Only the steamed fish n braised whole Abalone with dried oyster very nice. The Sauteed Prawns with Oatmeal Prawns quite nice but too spicy.Lastly the Rice shanghai style with Black Truffle also very delicious.Staff very nice n helpful
3
The restaurant has decor like it was in the 30's shanghai. It looked tired but maybe that was what it was meant to look like. The food was different to what i am used to (cantonese style). The Shanghai cuisine is meant to be a bit more refined but in being so perhaps lost a bit in flavour.The staff were great and each course arrived on time and served individually to the 12 in our party. Overall I thought the food wasnt bad and maybe I am doing the restaurant a diservice just because I am not familier with the cuisine. So I would say do try it. Oh I forgot to mention the live music provided on stage by a half decent band

My sister's wedding and they booked the entire place. Quite interesting cabaret layout and not all tables are round, some are semi circlesFood is ok, probably slightly better than regular hotel ballroom fare. There's live entertainment throughout, jazzy shanghai songsService is typical and bla

The restaurant is well decorated with very good service, entertainment and not to mention the food. We were there on a Wednesday night and it was quite crowded so it has to be good. Will try for lunch next time we visit Singapore.
5
It is a very nice Chinese fine dinning Restaurent. Comprehensive menu. Good service. Very 'Chinese' ambiance.
5
this restaurant located next to grand copthorne waterfront hotel.There do have a singer nightly singing chinese oldies and the loudness is just nice.I will go back simply because their floor service is good and price also reasonable.

@TheKuoKnowsGrand Shanghai is not satisfied with just serving grand food. It goes the extra mile to do it in grand style too.The restaurant looks a bit like a 1930s Hollywood film set. You half expect Marlene Dietrich and Clive Brook to ghost into the dining room, as you dig into starters of smoked fish, crispy eels and drunken chicken.That's never going to happen. But good food and good service does happen at Grand Shanghai. It is a good proponent of Shanghai cuisine in Singapore.The stir fried shrimps are well made. The crustaceans could be just a tad smaller, though. The Lion's Head is another must-have. You can almost taste the TLC that went into the making of the pork rissoles.Give the Shanghai Wontons a try. They are quite different to the Cantonese version. That is not to say they are any better - just different.While Red Bean Pancakes are, strictly speaking, not from Shanghai, they help to complete an enjoyable meal.Grand Shangai gets my nod of approval but, be warned, it can be a little on the pricey side

I have been to this restaurant many many times since 2007.When i think of the old chinese jazz band and the chinese singers i always went there.We can also choose the songs for them to sings.I think nowaday cannot found this type of restaurant.My friends in their 60s and 70s they enjoyed very much.Last month my friend birthday,their food standard was still very good.Especially the suckling pig very crispy and no oil in the skin.Service was good but price abit expensive. 10 peoples spent about $2000 after discount
4
Nice experience dining here during an event. Loads of different courses - couldn't event tell you what some of them were. Some were superb, some were OK, some were strange to my tastes! Nice ambience in restaurant, friendly staff and drinks kept well topped up throughout. Traditional singing as entertainment. Pretty good all round

This restaurant is in the same building as The Copthorne Waterfront Hotel. We went to the restaurant for a slap up meal and were not dissappointed. The menu was written in Chinese and at first we did wonder what we were going to order as there was very little we could understand. We were in luck tho as one of the waitresses realised we didnt know what to do and came to oir table and explained everything to us. She had spent a few years in Manchester near to where we live so her English was good. What followed was 3 course of some of the best chinese food we have ever tasted anywhere in the world. Anyone visiting Singapore should eat here, dont be afraid to ask for help navigating the menu, its worth it
4
The food was very good and service likewise, only thing unsettling is that the poor waitresses seem to rush every where, (what was that blurr that went past)The meal servings are generous and would you believe it, you can buy a draft beer for only $9.50, that's super cheap in Singapore.The restaurant is expansive and the decor is old time Singapore architecture, check for restaurant opening times

I went with a group of friends in their 60s and 70s and they greatly enjoyed themselves inspite of the average food standards.Food wise, there were nothing spectacular. The Shanghainess dishes are a little run of the mill in terms of taste. For example the vegetarian duck and the drunken chicken were really not very impressive. Best thing was the steamed fish head in cut chillies which was very fresh. We also had the four seasons string beans which was alright but I think that dish is more Sichuan.Saving grace is the live music and singing throughout the dinner. It's no concert but there is a certain charm with the mainland Chinese singers backed by a trio of old musicians. Reminded me of the old jazz band at the Peace Hotel in Shanghai. Good effort.The quality of cooking is average, but the price is also average and the entertainment is unique. So it is a good place to catch up with "old friends" and soak in a bit of old Shanghai
4
I've been there quite a number of times and I quite like the food. The price is reasonable and the food are tasty. My mum like the food there so we went there a few times for our family dinner.The ambience is nice and they usually has performance at night. With the old Chinese song and warm lighting, the atmosphere is really good
4
Authentis and delicious foods xiao lung pao, stew baby abalonies , good service, relaxing ambience with some great live Chinese musics.
4
As the title suggests, this restaurant evokes memories of old Shanghai. The decor and the entertainment it provides brings the diner back to Shanghai of the Twenties. The food is okay, nothing fantastic but the service is good and the ambience is good.
5
This hotel was very good for eating out but again for non-vegetarians...... the ambiance was really very good
4
The ceilings are high with lovely chandeliers. During the evenings, they have live music so it's a good place to come for dinner with entertainment. They serve Shanghainese food. Only thing is they have a lot of vouchers etc so sometimes I think prices can be further discounted from the menu.
4
Had dinner there on a Friday evening. Mainly business crowd, with some couples.Food was tasty, though presentation was a little dull.On the whole, it felt slightly pricey considering the portion and quality, but the decor and the live entertainment probably accounts for a significant portion of the cost.I would probably only come on special occasions
4
This restaurant is very popular so do make sure you book especially on Public Holidays and weekends. Also, they do cater for private parties so you may find the restaurant is closed to the public particularly on Saturday nights. In the evenings they have a band and singer crooning old and new Chinese songs. Dim Sum is lovely and so is the a la cart
4
Was there for a wedding dinner. Overall, the food was very good and the service of the staffs were very good as well.The design for this restaurant is very nice, very Shanghai like, it does bring you back to the old Shanghai.Really do enjoy the dinner, but it is very expensive.
5
Dined here during a recent stay, as a group of 4. The food and service were of a very high quality. The restaurant has a lovely old world atmosphere, greatly enhanced by the fascinating singer and band. One could almost imagine Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall walking in. A great evening out
4
The restaurant was great. From entering the restaurant, down the stairs and to the table that I was seated, I think it gives an opulent grand kind of feeling - really back to the golden old days... like how you watch movies of yesteryear - that gives a very nostalgic grand shanghai kind of feeling. Food wise was better than average. I wouldn't say it's wow but it's OK. I guess people go for the ambience and live singing, whihc I enjoyed thoroughly. I was there on a Thursday and the performance was great, especially when the performer has had interaction with the audience. The performance was mainly Chinese songs of yesteryear, the songs my parents would love... but I found myself thoroughly enjoying the meal and performance. It was an incredibly enjoyable evening. However, a point to note is that if the table cloth used were not red... it could have been better. Because it could be quite straining to the eyes, especially under the cosy yellow lightings. I would recommend a visit, and I'm definitely bringing my parents for a meal there - to enjoy the performance!

I can't believed this place actually gets a ok star review. It was my mother's birthday celebration and i decided to bring her to have a enjoyable Chinese dinner. Ordered Fish Maw soup, ok not bad.Ordered the Pekking Duck, the popiah skin was so thick that i can't taste the roasted duck skin.Xiao Long Bao was so so because I had better ones.BIRD NEST dessert was tasteless and not worth $50.Other dishes was bad...Enough said, avoid this place at all cost
4
Food was served fast and piping hot.
Service was good and up to restaurant standard.
Place was clean and friendly to kids and elderly.
5
excellent traditional Cantonese cuisine in the Esplanade by the Bay, excellent staff and range of dishes, entrance looks small, but opens up into a large dining area
3
expensive, normal Chinese food. Nothing is special. Not crowded though. It's near the hotel I stayed.

Typical chinese restaurant, lots of different food, both from the sea as well as chicken, vegetables and such.
4
Stayed at Holiday Inn Atrium so just a short stroll across road to restaurant . Staff friendly and helpful. We ordered too much !! Spare ribs , Peking duck a prawn dish and stir fry vegetables but all absolutely gorgeous and white Sauvignon blanc to accompany! As well as jasmine tea . The singer created a lovely atmosphere and quite busy so a good restaurant to recommend . Maybe a little expensive not knowing portion sizes and over ordering but that was our fault

We visited this restaurant after reading about it and were not disappointed. It was like being in a Humphrey Bogart film. The restaurant is on th ground floor of a tower near the river. The room is big with large round tables in the middle and smaller booths at the side where we sat. The room is lit by several large chandeliers. At one end of the room is a stage with a backdrop of old Shanghai where the 3 piece band and singer in long evening dress performed.The menu has the names of dishes in English but we were guided in our choice by our very friendly and helpful waitress Paulyn Chou who ensured we had a variety of dishes but did not order too much food. Dishes included meat ball soup, prawns, chicken and rice. We really appreciated this as often restaurants will try to encourage customers to buy more. My husband drank Tiger beer and I had a large pot of tea after my gin and tonic. Other drinks including wine were available.I am not an expert on Chinese popular music or, indeed, Chinese food but the delicious meal and the ambience created by the live music ensured that we will visit again next time we are in Singapore
4
Took a 10 pax set dinner, cost more than 1.4k. It is a little pricey but probably because of the occasion. The food is good but the place understaffed. Food quality is there, portion is good. Atmosphere is great! Parking is easy. Get a table at the centre in front of the stage, you would find yourself enjoying the performance at night
4
Had dinner with 6 friends on a Friday night. The place was packed and luckily we have reservation. The ambience is very nostalgic and feels like Old Shanghai. The live 3 man band (elderly gentlemen ) and lady singers played songs of yesteryear.I had dining here before and the food standard was still very good. Surprising the price is very reasonable.Thoroughly a very enjoyable evening and we started longer than usual to enjoy these wonderful old Chinese songs.Brought back lots of memories.Much try
4
Went with family for dinner. Good, authentic Shanghainese cold dishes not to be missed. I should know as I had spent a lot of time in Shanghai over the last decades. The children love the roasted Beijing duck. Ambience is warm and the lady singers gave us all the old Chinese favorites. Have been visiting this place a few time each yearr\. Service is consistent and not overbearing
5
Went there for the second time for my son birthday celebration. The atmosphere is nice, food is good and the staff is excellent. We request for a complimentary house wine to be taken back home. The staff thought that we forgotten to collect it and even call me to check. Never expect such good servic

They charged you price which isnt listed in their menu, beware!

The place was a little surreal, a lady singing with live music a big chandelier and red fabric booths. Food was really good and the service was impecable.

Went there for lunch 2 weeks ago to celebrate the birthday of a family member. The ambience and deco was good. They've a nice round table with a nice round couch if your group is not too large. We ordered the smoked duck, fried shanghai-ness new year cake, deep fried prawn with salted egg yolk and some dim sum.The Nan Xiang xiao long bao (steam dumpling with pork) is great. It is very juicy and the skin has the right texture and thickness. The fried shanghai-ness new year cake (savory) is flavorful. The new year cake has absorbed the broth and taste great. The salted egg yolk prawn is somewhat disappointing. I'll expect a proper restaurant like Grand Shanghai to use bigger prawn for this dish. The size of the prawn is well below average, even smaller than those that are served in the Cze Char stall (at neighborhood coffee shop). Wil likely return for a dinner some other time for the live band performance.
5
Came here for Father’s Day and were delighted. A lovely old-fashioned place with quite a formal appearance but the service was excellent with friendly staff and efficient service. Food was delicious. We will certainly come back in the evening because we would love to hear the live band. There is a small stage with a panoramic/photographic backdrop depicting the Bund. You half expect Gong Li (as she appeared in “Shanghai Triad”) to appear and sing some smoochy number through crimson lips! Sorry – got a bit carried a way there … very pleasant riverside walk after the meal along to Robertson Quay … lovely experience all in al

I have been to this restaurant for a few times and was happy with the food and service until today. Totally disgusted by today staff especially the manager attitube, definitely would not go back again.I have a dining membership and grand shanghai is one of them, I was given a discount voucher that I would like to use today as it is going to expire.My sister family have arrived the restaurant first and have place the order for dim sum, which cannot use the voucher. When me and my family arrived, after some discussion we decided to cancel the previous order and place another order. But what we get from the Manager is a sarcastic reply "The dim sum is already 50% today, it is not expensive etc" I thought nevermind maybe I am sensitive.But until I was told by my family that the manager talking to the other staff " Cannot afford dont come here" and my family also told me that all of them can feel the different attitube after that. Regardless of that everyone just finished the meal and left.My point is if it is difficult to cancel the previous order, you can just highlight to us. We didn't want to make life difficult for you. We asked and did not insist.Also in customer service industry, how can one serve in this kind of attitube. Since we are unhappy and the manager and staff felt that we cannot afford it, we will not to go back again to pay your salary. Sorry to say that previous good impression was ruined by today despicable attitube

I had invited two friends for a quick lunch and this restaurant did not disappoint. Even though this was the first time that I had dined at the restaurant, the staff ranging from the manager, David Lim and the waitresses were helpful and attentive. As I am new to their menu, I followed the recommendations made by David and was very happy with them. First of all, David recommended the right number of dishes and he is the sort of manager who 'looks after' your wallet. My party especially enjoyed the Fish Soup - the broth was delectable with slices of fresh fish and fresh bamboo shoots. 3 of us had 2 servings each of this soup. Another dish which I would recommend is the Deep fried Bean curd Seafood - the seafood here consists of fish and prawn paste; and the bean curd skin that enveloped it was paper thin fried to crispy texture. We ended the meal with 2 snowballs with red beans and bananas. This balls are deep fried and dusted with icing sugar, but their texture is almost souffle like. Yes, this restaurant is definitely worth another visit

I went to this restaurant as a guest of a Singaporean couple. What a surprise!!!! It has a grand appearance, with a little stage and a singer accompanied by musicians. Music played was probably of the 50's early 60's. Food and service were excellent. We had Peking duck (2 ways), dimsum, winter melon soup and others.After dinner I recommend a stroll. Go through the doors at the back of the restaurant and you will be in for a surprise. I recommend this restaurant if you want to eat good, if I recall correctly, Shanghainese cusine
5
Really good Chinese at a good price. The interior decor is grand and there was a live band playing and it has an old style 30s/40s feel... Reminded me of restaurant in opening scene of Indiana Jones and temple of doom!We had smoked duck with pancakes which was great if just for having it served to you at the table and watching the pancakes being filled and wrapped at speed with chopsticks
3
Was there for a wedding reception yesterday during lunch. I would say that the atmosphere inside the restaurant is pretty "shanghai" with the deco and music played during lunch. However I do find the food a tad below my expectation. The shark fins soup was too gluey to my likings and the smoked duck was a tad too saltish. Other than that, the seafood tasted fresh. Understand that the wedding package is $799++ per table which works out to be about $93 per pax. At this moment, it seems to be a relatively value for money place to hold weddings as the hotels will surely exceeds the $1000 mark
5
Been to this restaurant a few times and they've never failed me, be it the food or the service. The ambience is like their namesake, Grand Shanghai. Live band entertainment with ladies that spurn out chinese oldies while you dine away with their classy and well proportioned dishes. Quality of food is superb
