This time I have really appreciated the hainanese chicken rice! The rice is delicious. It also smells good. I will always remember Singapore with this one.

When I first moved to Singapore I used to laugh at people queuing up for chicken rice! I soon realised that was to my detriment! Without a doubt this has to be the best place for chicken rice in Singapore! Try it to believe it! Love this joint! Happy to keep queuing up for more!

Chicken - steamed or roasted. Rice. Broth (from the chicken). a few spring onions. God damn, it tastes better then heaven. The wait can get long because some don't follow basic hawker stall etiquette and order for large groups from just one person in line but it is worth the wait. And I do not wait in line. For anything

We stayed at the new hotel Premier Inn across the street. It did not take long to find Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice. Lucky we got there at somewhat 11:30 am -- at 12 noon the line (que) got quite long. I agree with other reviews, this is one of the best ever tasting chicken rice places I've ever found. They even have a lower cost kids portion for 1 SGD. We ate there twice in the span of 3 days. For sure this place is memory marked for going back to many more times

I ordered a plate of chicken (breast) rice for S$2.50. Larger portion is S$3.50. The chicken is smooth and soft while the rice has the right ginger fragrant. The soup and the chili sauce are both awesome too. This is totally my style of chicken rice. Love it!The store is open from 11am onwards if I'm not mistaken

Found this hidden chicken rice stall online, figured to give it a try. When I reached there, was quite surprise of how small and crowded the place was. It was due to the dinner hour over the weekend, so won't recommend if you're heading there with large group over the weekend. Need to fight for the seat.Although it was a bit of the waiting line, after all it's totally worth the wait. The soup was one of the kind, never had a chicken rice soups with so much vegetable in it, not to mention they were giving a cold vegetable side dish for free as well. The chicken was tender, a bit fatty but those can be removed. Conclusion: I'll definitely going back again during the less peak hours
