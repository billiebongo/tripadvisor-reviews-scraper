Food is good but very crowded during lunch hours hence resulting in slow service when comes to serving food.
4
The service was great and the window seat allowed for great views of the cbd area. Had steamboat and the seafood selection was exceptionally fresh. Service was prompt as well.
4
Good venue for business lunches but pricey for what was served, although it was very good (tasty) and of very good quality.
4
Would have loved to see more dim sum choices on the menu. They serve excellent home brewed Chinese herbal drinks. Ask for recommendations. One thing: the air-conditioning is a tad cold.
3
We went for the Dim Sum buffet. Great variety of food options and unique dishes. Thought that service of staff can be better improved.
5
We tried the weekend dim sum buffet, there is a good selection of items in the menu, service was prompt and food was tasty, good value for money. A great place to enjoy peacefully with family without the crazy weekend crowd.
5
We were a table of 10 adults at their promotional ala-carte dim sum buffet. The dimsum were exquisite and service was impeccable. The Crystal Jade Prestige dim sum platter was excellent.
3
it was a pleasant lunch. The good was delicious, nice and tasty. The service was good and staffs are friendly.
5
Returned again. Good location in CDB area for business entertainment, food quality is good, atmosphere is good as well & etc
5
Was there to try their dimsum high tea with family. Happy to be seated at a table with view to keep my baby nephew entertained. The place is nicely litted with both lights & natural sunlight. Service is certainly commendable. Food quality is great. Simply spoilt for choice on what to order. The egg tarts that we waited for 10min is totally worth it, for it's freshly prepared upon ordering. Thanks to the service members for making the afternoon a memorable one for us.
4
We had dim sum buffet that day. Food and service of the restaurant is good and attentive. Good place for gathering and occasion celebration.
5
Xiao Long Bao and Siew Mai are yummy and, Manager on duty was very nice and friendly, patient. Pandan greentea buns were not overly sweet - just nice
4
The weekend dim sum buffet is priced at $38++ per pax. There is around $3.5++ charge for the tea. Book early to reserve the seats
3
The dim sum buffet was value for money! It is definitely a good deal and I would love to go back again!
5
Yummy dimsum, food layout too nice to eat. Location is and easy to find. Staff were very polite and quick to refill tea and clear the plates.
3
Had the weekend dim sum buffet. Reasonably good value for the price. Quality was above average. Sitting times were abit too short though
5
The servicd is excellent, and not to mention the tasty food. Overall, a great experience. Highly recommended.
3
Food was okay. Ambience was good. Value is so so. Environment pleasant. But can't help for the price as it's in business district.
3
Service wasn't great, took for ever to top up tea that was $8 per person. some of the items weren't as good as when ordered ala carte
Cashier couldn't split bill evenly
5
The staff were all very friendly, quality of food was good, they came quite promptly after you make the order through their staff, which was kinda busy most of the time, but still manage to handle all the tables professionally. Price was decent and the atmosphere was cosy as well.
4
Good promotion for the dim sum buffet. Worth the price. Good to have more similar promotion to explore the restaurant menu
4
The dim sum buffet at $36.8++ was fabulous although i would say the price was steep for dim sum. The food quality and service well made up for it.
5
I will go back again. As the food....service...Atmasphere...all u can think of are excellent Thumbup×1000
4
The service is excellent! However the aircon too strong for me and my friend. The dim sum turned cold very quickly before we could finish.
5
Dim sum was exquisite and the service is really good. They pay attention to your needs and i will definitely come back again
5
A family lunch for 7 on last Saturday. The service and food was great. Crystal Jade Prestige was cosy and nice ambience.
5
Excellent food and service.
Love the dim sum lunch.
Love Winnie
Please bring back the executive lunch seta.

Came with my family and relative for Mother's Day and birthday celebration. The elders are happy with the food. Services are great as waitress attends to our requests asap. Will definitely come again.

Went for dim sum brunch with friends on a Sunday because they had this buffet promo of S$36.8/ per pax. There were 5 of us in total. Generally speaking, the taste and the quality of the food is decent. Services are satisfactory given that we are in Singapore. However, what we didn't like about it is they served you kimchi at the beginning without informing you that you needed to pay for it. Same as wet tissues. Not like it's a lot of money but we'd have felt a lot more pleased had they made it transparent in the first place. It's a practice that restaurants in Singapore should really do away with if they really wanna excel in their CRM.
4
Hard to find the place at first, would suggest you to ask the concierge in MBFC to guide u the way.. was greeted by the staff.. small place but overall clean and ceiling were pretty high so it's ok.. they serve you a appetising plums shot pretty good! DIMSUM and service was good.. food was serve pretty fast. Good place for business lunch
4
The service was really good which made my dining experience with my friends really enjoyable. Food was nice and with the current 25% discount really very worth it.
4
Great service. Was greeted well and the waiting time to be served is fast. But I was a little disappointed with their foods.
4
Portion is too small, but food is great, especially the braise pork. But not easy to locate the place.
4
The dim sum was good especially the baked char siew pastry which was buttery and had juicy filling and the siew mai with truffle sauce was delicious.
5
We had Ha Kao, chive dumpling, Crispy cheong fun, laksa beancurd, and a few others。All yummy!
Do also try the vinegar pig trotters, and chicken feets cooked in 2 ways. Very good
Service was prompt and staffs were very attentive to our needs.
5
Good choice for weekend dim sum. Food quality is excellent, Nice quiet restaurant with good ambience. Good variety on the menu.
5
Quality of food is consistently good. Environment is nice and cosy. Quite speedy in serving as well. Highly recommend this place!

Disappointed by the whole suckling pig which we paid at $268 for, the pig was burnt and worse than any common roasters. Service from the china server who served us had a super bad attitude, plain rice was also forgotten until being reminded. Dont mind paying the premium but there are many more options around plus the crazy parking lots shortage at mbfc.Will never return again. Yucks
4
We had a dim sum lunch which overall was very good. Some items were OK - the char siu bau was nothing special and the xi long bao the same. But the fried carrot cakes was heavenly as was the prawn/mango croquettes and also the chee chung fan.So verasll - a very good lunch.Nice dÃ©cor inside and a good view from the front; boo hoo we were at the back. And had to wait fro about 5/6 minutes for our table despite having booked
3
Food was very average, the suckling pig roll with truffle pearl rice- rice too wet. Though the restaurant was not packed on Sat night, filling up of our tasteless tea was very slow.Was promised the longevity buns but we waited till after our desserts and I had to ask only to find out they forgotten! There were only about 4 tables and we were the only one celebrating a birthday. Nothing "prestigious" about this restaurant. Maybe the normal Crystal Jade out in the malls fare better. Been a while since I patronised a crystal Jade and it sure was disappointing.
5
Great food, service is good, efficient - especially when you are rush for time at lunch on a work day.
4
The restaurant is a little hard to find, accessible by a small lift tucked away in a little corner of MBFC. However, there is a nice view of the MBFC area with the full length glass windowsThe service here is fantastic and the food is really nice but a little pricy.We had a birthday celebration for my mom and the staff brought out the cake on a decorated glass plate and sang a happy birthday song for her.Will definitely come back here again when we have a special occasion
4
The Good:1. Good, prompt and considerate service. Our tea-cup was always filled, our dirty plates cleared, and even our ta-pao bag handed over to us when we left it behind!2. Food was good, and it had the typical taste one would expect of Cantonese food in Singapore restaurants.The Not-so-good:1. The ambiance and decor are very muted and blah. You can't even look through the windows as they are covered in sheer blinds.2. I felt that the same dishes I ordered at Crystal Jade Dining In outlet a month ago, tasted far better.3. The traditional music was a bit loud and shrill at times.4. Access to this place is via a tiny lift hidden away
4
Excellent, if hurried service. Unfortunately the courses did not come in the right order, or at the same time for all the guests at the table.The Dim Sum was average, however the cooked food was a revelation! Unfortunately the temperature of the restaurant was too cold for comfort.I would gladly return to this restaurant to enjoy the cooked food, and excellent service
4
The set lunch was delicious and filling - but the dishes were not served in sequence e.g. appetiser followed by soup etc. It was their service (from waiter/waitress to manager) that left a deep impression on me for that visit. They were prompt, friendly and always smiling :
4
Food was not bad, atmosphere wise based on the seating was not too crowded. Food variety was ok. Didn't like the pork ribs much as it was more fats than meat. But the salted egg was an enjoyment. Pricing was slightly on the high side based on it's name. Its so place for seafood fans. Staff was friendly. Will come again
3
For a Michelin star restaurant, the special Michelin set was good although it did not exceed expectations in any way. The truffle tofu and the fish noodle were great but the cold appetizer and nourishing soup were nothing to shout about. Ditto the suckling pig roll which had to ordered in advance. Portions were sample sizes.Service is sadly not as attentive as I had expected for a Michelin star restaurant. Table seating was also rather crammed and conversations around could be heard throughout
5
The previous tenant has Paradise Pavilion has set the bar to provide exceptional service and awesome great food. So we are always curious how this new restaurant fare.We made a telephone reservation and were glad to be greeted by a familiar face, Ms Shuang Shuang!Honestly the ambience is not what I will describe as "Prestige". There are 3 different types of furnitures of which one of them stood out, awkwardly.Food-wise, we are here for dim sum and the food quality as well as presentation did not disappoint us. However, to us their signature PiPa duck seemed to be over-rated. Maybe some of you can share your views too. Surprisingly, their mango pudding is out-of-the-world to me! Best I ever tried!Service was great and both the Waiters and Waitresses have been attentive. Shuang Shuang even brought 2 different pillows for my pregnant wife to choose for her back support. What a sweet and thoughtful gesture! She also brought some colouring and joinIng dots activities to keep my son occupied before the food is served.Overall experience is great and we will return to try out their other signature dishes
5
We were stuffed from the set lunch menu. Each person on the table had a choice of fish or beef which I thought was very nice to have a choice. The dim sum was extremely fresh. Very pleased and would be back for a business lunch
5
Food was excellent. The intro papaya soup was flavoursome. One of the dim sum in the shape of a fish stuffed with mushroom etc was like truffle burst in the mouth. The fried dim sum was relatively not outstanding but still melt in the mouth. The complimentary longevity buns for the birthday treat was a nice touch. Service was super attentive. If any gripes, the first few courses came too close to each other.
5
Dim sum lunch was very good. Food was served promptly, always service with a smile. Will definitely be back again for more.
5
The service staff were very attentive and polite.
Food was good. Great ambience and nice decorations.

This is the only proper Chinese restaurant in MBFC... The rest are all "cafe" like....
Recommended if you are in this area and no better place to go.
Their dim sum is good.
4
Nice Winter Melon Thick Soup with Crab Meat.
Complimentary Pipa Duck when signing up Jadeite membership with DBS Debit & Credit Card till end September 2016.
Fried Mango roll with shrimp & Garoupa Fish Fillet is worth trying...
4
Food was served hot and nicely plated. Ambience was good. Overall this visit improved my perspection of this restaurant as my first visit was not really great.
4
We went for the weekend brunch and was recommended for the 6 course Michelin Recommended Set Menu. I have to say that at $68 per pax, this was value for money. The appetizer was refreshing. Broiled soup and the dim sum (4 pcs) were excellent. There were 2 mains - pan fried fish was tasty but the beef was a bit let down. The udon and desserts were just OK. However, the service was excellent .

My wife and I went to this restaurant on a Saturday night. It was in the Marina Bay Financial Centre and was not busy. The waiter explained that weekday lunches were their busy periods. The food was excellent. We had two soups, a seafood / tomato special that was good and the szechuan hot and sour which was excellent -very spicy. two meat dishes, the cubes with garlic, good, and the Japanese Wagyu, excellent. Spinach in garlic which wife didn't care for but I liked and ate most of the plate. Service was unimpressive - had to ask for mineral water numerous times and I was very specific about the order of the meat dishes but they came out reversed. Having said that, when I sent the Wagyu back because I wanted it after the cubes, when the Wagyu later came out it was clearly a new piece the chef had freshly cooked. Would I go back ? Mmm, no. The service at a restaurant shouldn't be dependant on me luckily selecting what time they are busy or when the "A" team is on
3
I went to the restaurant over the weekend for lunch and found it was poorly patronised. Ours was one of 4 perhaps 5 tables. The food served was not exceptional and the serving was not done in sequence. The soup was served towards the end of the lunch and they missed one dish, for which we had to remind them. There was nothing outstanding about it. The serving staff were good as was the restaurant manager who was friendly and took time to talk with us (possibly because it was empty). Unless you are familiar with the new Marina Bay area, it can be a challenge to find it, based on the address
4
We had the 8 course weekend brunch, from 6 categories (appetisers, soup, dim sum, wok-fried, main and desserts). We got to try almost everything as there were about 3 to 4 items in each category. My sister was a Jadeite member with DBS/POSB card, thus we were given a complimentary Prestige Pipa duck. The prawns used in the dim sum were very fresh. I love the 3 soups. The mains (Angel hair pasta and E-Fu noodles) were good except for the fried rice which I felt it was a bit salty. My parents enjoyed the food and it was quite value for money at $38++ per pax.
5
5 of us were there last Saturday and we ordered the Brunch Specials (S$48++/person). The selection was quite extensive and the food was tasty. The only complaint was that majority of the food was different types of dim sum. It would be good if there were other type to choose. The service was very good.
