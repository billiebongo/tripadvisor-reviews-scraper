I love the popiah here - they added a crunchy texture which made the experience just that much better. It was really good, and I highly recommend trying popiah here.

"Popiah" is a local snack type food. And probably this stall made one of the best popiah in Singapore.The popiah skins are made fresh daily- you can see the man in the stall doing it.Definitely should try. Remember to tell the lady making the popiah if you want chilli to be added. Chili can be a little too spicy for some

I re-visited this stall several times and will continue to make it a regular stop. The popiah are rolled fresh while you wait and skins are cooked on the premises. Popiah skins are smothered with a tamarind based sauce then sprinkled with chopped egg, tofu, bean shoots and other herbs, then a braised veg mix is spooned on top before rolling up and cut into bite sized sections. Totally delicious and very cheap.There is always a queue which means it is good food. I learned to get in early before the lunch time rush. I love watching the man at the back of the stall, rhythmically cooking the skins to Bollywood hits while I'm waiting in line

Visited this little outlet at the Chinatown Complex food centre.Since visiting, I couldn't shake off the need to eat Popiah and tried it wherever I saw it but I have to say this was the best.The shop has a gentleman who makes their popiah skin from scratch all day, I hear this is a dying art and it's part of what makes this popiah special.The popiah is filled with stewed turnip, chilli sambal, chopped up egg, lettuce, crunchy bean sprout and crunchy batter bits. What I loved about this popiah was that it was rolled tightly, and it wasn't watery, most of all, it was so tasteful

Per their signboard, this stall has been around since 1958. Certainly a very long time for a small food business.Their specialty is Popiah, a very nice, popular local snack-type food. Basically various ingredients like vegetables, egg, etc are rolled into a popiah skin. The popiah here is very good. There are many regulars who come here often. Another item sold here is Kueh Pie Tee- also a popular local snack here. For those who wants delivery or advance take away orders, you can call them. However, there is a minimum order amount.Definitely worth a try if one has not eaten popiah before.
