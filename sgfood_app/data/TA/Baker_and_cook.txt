Very good place to show up and pick the type of bread that you want, all of them are good. The jams are homemade and amazing.

The piccolo latte is my preferred coffee. They have great tarts and nice salads. You can enjoy croissants for breakfast.
The breads are also of good quality

Regularly visited here for their awesome bread loafs - pricey but worth it! And also on occasion for pizza with my girlfriend, which was also excellent. We enjoy walking and the walk to the cafe through the linear parkway was beautiful, very relaxed without car traffic. And from outside the charming lighting of Baker and Cook is a wonderful sigh

It is a cosy and lovely neighbourhood bakery that make a wide variety of high quality artisan pastries and breads. A place for thoese who appreciate great quality and authentic recipe. The eatery in Swan Lake, also offer sourdough pizza under the counter of 'Plank'. They even sell Danish Rugbrod, which is difficult to find in SG. A hearty breakfast with great coffee or power drink is about S$20 per head. You could get the usual eggs Benedict, pancakes stack, and many other dishes. My favourite is their ham & cheese croissant - super flaky, soft, shatter-crisp and mouth-meltingly tender & buttery. Love it! Great place for family to start a relaxing day

We had an excellent brunch, the salmon Quiche, salad plate, and Egg Mayo advocado sandwitch is highly recommended. The Stacked pancakes not bad either. $ 9 for the Matcha smoothie is not good value. The coffees are very good. We are also a big fan of the Danish Ryebread and the Wallnut break, which they slice and put in freezer bags for us. Highly Recommended

There are 2 restaurants , Baker & Cook serving Western selections and the Plank serving oven baked Pizzas. A nice and cozy place for coffee and cakes, esp the Danish pastry.This is a doggie friendly restaurant with water bowls provided.This place get very crowded during the weekends and holidays.To avoid the crowds come during off peak hours.Parking is by the road side and do be careful as LTA officers patrol this area regularly

You can do the brunch thing, the cake thing, the afternoon tea thing, the coffee break thing...Sit indoors with your family or outdoors with your pooch, it's a happy chic place offering good tucker.We had quiche and salads and took away our desserts. Hahaha. Happy happy me.Am so happy we have a Baker and Cook in this neighbourhood

We've been to Baker & Cook / Plank several times, and after dinner this past weekend knew we needed to write a review. Just a terrific spot. Delicious, fresh food, friendly service, and a good value (which is hard to find in S'pore). Portions are generous and ingredients are fresh. Nice ambience, low key but engaging soundtrack of soft rock/pop - not in your face but a nice backdrop. Highly recommend

When my family wants to eat western on weekend mornings but not Starbucks or Coffee Bean, this is the place we go to. The bread selection is really good. I normally order Eggs Benedict with Crispy Bacon, some bread, salad & coffee. Drinking water is free.I particularly like the address: 1 Swan Lake Avenue. Many of the roads here are named after famous operas. This place is called Opera Estate.If going there by car, I normally enter from Upper East Coast Road. But it is quite deep in. I am told there is a pedestrian shortcut from New Upper Changi Road but I am not sure. There is very limited roadside parking. So I normally park along Swan Lake Avenue. As long as you don't block anyone, it should not be a problem.

We come here most weekends combining the family dog walk and bread run with a tasty breakfast out. The place is very family and dog friendly - and always busy. If you want to secure a seat outside under a fan with your dog, come early or late to beat the rush. Service is generally excellent, although at times the quality of the food can slip when its very busy.We have also been here for lunch and have really enjoyed the salmon quiche and the morrocan lamb roll with salad combo.I would highly reccommend visiting if you live in the area and havent yet discovered this gem
