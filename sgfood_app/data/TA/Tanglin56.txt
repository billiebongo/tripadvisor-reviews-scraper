Beautiful table by the pool and lots of friends. Tasty food and extremely cheap in a place like Singapore. The only thing you need is a friend who is a member of tis club. You mmust go if given an opportunity, for the food and more for the experienc

Whilst on a business trip, found this place by chance, walking west along Orchard Road on to Tanglin Road up to Napier Road crossroads. What a find! Its small inside area has a nice atmosphere. The raised outside seating area is larger and is covered. The food was delicious and reasonably priced for central Singapore. The staff were wonderful. The manager Alexander was particularly impressive - courteous and efficient. I will go back next time I'm in Singapore

We found this place by accident as situated close to our hotel. Staff extremely friendly, all full of smiles. Food very reasonably priced for Singapore & tasty. Wine selection was extensive as were other drinks. Also fairly priced. We had dinner twice & enjoyed breakfast once. A layback style of place with couches, tables & chairs. Outside but fully covered with fans making the temperature quite comfortable. Not far from Orchard Roa

We've been to Singapore a few times, but had never discovered this gem of a place before. We stopped for an early dinner after we arrived from Vietnam - and stayed for a few extra wines. The wines are very reasonably priced by Singapore standards. The meal was awesome - so tasty! The best part (if you really want a breakdown), was the staff. So courteous, so attentive. The best reference I can give is that we went back for dinner the following night, and went again for breakfast the day after that! Fantastic value, fantastic place to drink and or eat and drink. I urge you to visit - we'll be back
