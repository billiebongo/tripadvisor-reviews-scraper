Was here for a work lunch. Was not impressed. Dim sums were quite run of the mill whilst the rest of the food items were overly oily and really salty!

Great food and Dim Sum and always great service especially the floor manager ... the Waiters and Waitresses are always attentive to details .. love their dim sum especially their custard bun, XO carrot cake and XLB ...

We usually go there on weekends. we have been regulars since 10 years. Food quality has been always consistently great. Good value for money!

Had dim sum lunch there. Har Gow (虾饺) shrimp was fresh and succulent. Liu Sha Bao was above average. The other Dim sum we tried were average. Staff is friendly and attentive.

I have fond memories of the steamed spare rib with glass noodle on two previous visits and when we decided to go for dim sum on new year’s day, Bosses Restaurant came to mind immediately. But sadly disappointed. It wasn’t the same anymore and the other dim sum we ordered were just very average for their prices. See receipt. We asked for warm water and was told that it is chargeable. We have no issues about it since most places charge for it anyway but least did we expect to be charge $2 per pax. Separately, service was lacking too. Obviously, we are not going back

Been there twice and so far our favourite Singaporean Chinese restaurant. Service is kind and efficient. Place is calm. Possibility of eating in front of the bay. Dim sum, roasts, you name it! Various dishes and the Bosses' dim sum are better, more finesse than Din Tai Fung's. The fried rice with seafood is very good. I tried their ti Kuan yin tea which is a real pleasure. Will be back... as soon as we can , before we fly back to Switzerland

We had a family dinner there on a weekday and although the restaurant was pretty empty, service was just average. We had to pour tea on our own on several occasions. The salted prawns were very tasty. Other than that, I could not remember much of the rest of the dishes as they tasted pretty average for the steep prices. I find that there are many other Chinese restaurants which are much better in Singapore and definitely offer better prices.

I work in the neighbourhood and constantly looking for a good and not so noisy place to host business lunches. I walk pass the restaurant regularly but found it odd that from the entrance it looks more like a bar or a western restaurant than a Chinese restaurant. Anyways, one busy lunch hour, I took a couple of overseas guests to Black Society for lunch and I was happy that I did.This is not a budget restaurant; mains range from $20- $30 (more if you order exotic dishes) but the food quality justifies for the price
5
Although it was crowded but I was not left alone and every 5 minute there always an attention to be ready to serve my needs and really have a wonderful unforgettable moment and for sure will be highly recommended to all my business aquaintance.Well Done

We went to try out the restaurant after hearing about it. For a restaurant in Vivo City mall, it has quite a grand entrance with an interesting black themed decor. We loved the glowing blue lights from the fish tanks which gave the place character, but felt sorry for the fish in them. I know, I know..., this is typical of a Chinese restaurant, and so I tried not to look at them. The Signature fried noodles and Xiao Long Paos were very tasty and presented well. For two small eaters, the portion was more than enough for lunch. We also enjoyed the fried fish skins which were served before the meal instead of the usual boring peanuts at Chinese restaurants. Service was very good with half of the restaurant filled with diners on a Friday afternoon. The bill came up to just under $40. The restrooms in the restaurant were in line with the decor theme to look mysterious and dark. When you go up the 2 steps or so leading to the restrooms, you will face a panel of full length mirrors, and if not observant enough in the dark lighting, you might miss the small "push" signs which actually lead to the toilet cubicles. Just watch your step as it really is quite dark. Overall a good dining experience and we will return to try the other dishes.

The restaurant offers Chinese cuisine. Its a fine dinning restaurant but not up to my expectation. So, you decide whether want to try?

The family dinner brought us to this restaurant . The place decor was okay, as for the food it's so so only.the soup of the day was nice. And the prawns wasabi was okay. For the price paid. I won't recommend , it's so so fine sinning in Singapore.

We chose this restaurant for lunch based on good reviews and its reasonable price but it turned out to be a little pricey. Mainly also because we could make a table reservation as opposed to the more popular Tim Ho Wan and Din Tai Fung where they do not accept table reservations and where you have to stand in a long line of queue with a waiting period of between half an hour to an hour. Black Society restaurant (formerly known as Bosses Restaurant) looks dark and dim with its black décor and it looked small from the outside but we were amazed to find the restaurant huge inside. The table assigned to us faces the harbor front and we could see the monorail, cable cars and the Star Cruise Ship. It was indeed a lovely view. As it was a Sunday it was pretty crowded and hence service a little slow. We ordered the usual popular dim sum dishes like har kow, siew mai, siow long pau, char siew pow, steamed carrot cake etc. The skin of the char siew pau was nice and thin which was easy on the bite. We were a bit disappointed with the siow long pau as we have tasted better ones at the more popular restaurants. Some of my guests did not enjoy the salted egg custard bun or lava bun as it is so called. It costs $6 for 3 buns. At first bite, the salted egg yolk oozes out and hence tasted very eggy. Amongst our dim sum dishes we also ordered a vegetarian dish which was quite good and the restaurant's signature fried noodles. The medium portion was not much for 9 pax, we should have ordered the larger portion. Tea was pretty expensive at $3 per pax where normally other restaurants charge between $1.20 to $1.80 per pax. When questioned I was told that we were served Ginseng Oolong tea which we did not ask for. The ginseng was so mild that none of us could taste the ginseng at all. It tasted just like any other ordinary Chinese tea. Chinese tea costs $2.50 per pax.The rest room of the restaurant is black all around and is really dark and gloomy. I had to climb up 3-4 small steps and because it was so dark and with the reflection of a mirrror outside the toilet door I didn't know exactly where the toilet was. I decided to give it a miss lest I trip and fall and preferred to make use of the public rest room outside of the restaurant which was much brighter. On a scale of 1-5 I would rate the dim sum dishes 3.5

came for lunch with 2 colleagues. the dark exterior decor gives you the feeling you are entering into the den of chinese triad bosses. the restaurant is rather spacious. nice view overlooking to sentosa. we were shown to a booth. unfortunately for me, the booth has old seats which are showing wear and tear and i had be careful not to get scratched by the tear in the seats. service is above average. considering it was lunch time, we didn't have to wait too long for the food and the servers filled up the tea pot without being asked. we had dim sum - the food menu and quality are pretty good. but i found the items a little small in size but rather delightful and different from the other places. so overall, good for lunch. but avoid the booths at all cost! get a window seat so that you can get the server's attention and a nice view

A decent Chinese restaurant with an upmarket feel and an pretty good wine list. Dim sum was good, as was the other food, and all beautifully presented. Excellent and plentiful staff on hand to change plates when heeded etc. A bit pricey but nothing silly. I would say it is very suitable for business lunches and dinners. However.............I went for business but now cannot go back. They don't accept American Express so I couldn't stick the bill on my corporate card, which means starting a very tedious expense claim process. Any restaurant that doesn't accept Amex is removed from the list places we entertain clients. I know many associated that feel the same. It happens occasionally in smaller joints, but this is an upmarket restaurant and you really would expect them to take all major credit cards, especially since Amex is THE Corporate Card.A shame. Otherwise good

The décor made the place looked very posh. The menu was extensive and prices were comparable to high end Chinese restaurants in Singapore. The tofu with seafood was the best dish I could remember. The rest of the dishes were average. Surprisingly, the overall bill was not as expensive as I thought it would turn out to be

My family members have patronized this restaurant a few times before but it was the first time for me. Decked out in elegant black decor, the restaurant is unlike other Chinese restaurants commonly decorated in red colours. Judging from the number of "bosses" in an almost full lunch capacity, the restaurant is doing well. Even the twice activated fire alarms did not disrupt the lunch.We ordered a variety of dim sum selections. All were good. A few like the fried carrot cake, fried turnip cake, fish porridge, siu mai and prawn-mango rolls were very good. The twin-styled wasabi mayonnaise and salted egg prawns were exceptional.Well priced and recommended

Located in the Vivocity mall, some tables in this Chinese restaurant offers a good view of the waterfront and Sentosa Island. Serving great dim sum and other dishes as well as a good wine list, this is good for family gatherings and entertaining visitors who are in the area. Their signature buns filled with oozing 'lava' of salty egg yolk is no doubt the best and my favourite in town

Bosses (aka The Black Society) has a yummy dim sum for brunch/lunch. A must-have is their signature custard bun. Possibly one of the best I've had in Singapore so far. We recently visited the restaurant for dinner and had a very satisfying meal. The food items we ordered were quite flavorful (eg. claypot frog's legs, soft shell crabs) and served pretty quickly. Take note that dim sum items are not available for dinner. The restaurant offers great sea views looking out to Sentosa. My one peeve is having to pay $2 for water. They say it's refillable but still! Good thing the food makes up for this sore point

my family are regular to this restaurant (vivo city branch). we used to visit almost on a weekly basis prior to moving home to a further location which make our visit not as regular nowsaday. one of the waitress/supervisor recognize us and often offer free dessert (liu sa bao) - a type of salty egg yolk custard bun. I find this restaurant made one of the most delicious liu sa bao in SG

We tried some dim sum and also ordered some ala carte dishes to try.
The food was surprising delicious but it is quite pricey.
Location is ideal, with good view facing the sea. Definitely a good place for friends and family gathering.

Bosses Restaurant is an elegant, sophisticated Chinese restaurant with a good assortment of dimsum and other Chinese dishes. The restaurant itself is done up in a tasteful dark triad decor, with glossy tabletops and plush seats. If one is fortunate, they may get a table with gorgeous sea views overlooking Sentosa as well. Service was rather bruqsue though.For food, we tried their recommended Mango Century Egg Glass Roll (SGD$6.00), a beautiful concoction respledent with flavors of the sandy-flavored century egg, soursweet overtures of mango and spiciness of ginger, all wrapped up in paper thin, satin smooth skin.The Chilli Crab Tarts (SGD$8.50) were remarkably good - crispy tarts filled with chunks of spicy and springy crabmeat. It was a combination of heaven literally, and the palate loves this burst of spiciness and the flakiness of the tarts.We also love the Custard Lava Buns (SDG$6.00), with soft and sweet buns filled with the most tasty salted egg yolk "lava" oozing out once bitten into. The rich, coarse "lava" paints the palate beautifully in its flavor and warmth.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/02/afternoon-tea-at-bosses-restaurant-at.htm

There are many places serving nice expensive Chinese food, and Bosses is no exception. From the front entrance all the way to the back, the carpeted surface speaks of an up class restaurant. If you have a large group of people having dinner there, they will seat you at a large round table, with lines of beads draping from the ceiling around the table to act as a barrier and simulate privacy within the confines of the lines. The double boiled chicken soup is really good, with little MSG. A good salted egg custard bun would have its contents oozing out of the bun upon the first bite, which Bosses managed to achieve. However the bun’s outer covering was not consistent and was found to be very hard to bite into at certain parts. The other dishes were all fairly standard, but the tofu with shimeiji mushrooms was found to be mouth watering and suited well to the taste buds. One of the lacking bits of the restaurant is the lack of toilet facilities. There are only 2 cubicles and both are poorly lit. The common basin for washing hands is also poorly lit and the floor is often slippery because of the poor design of the basin. The soap dispenser runs out of soap and no one bothers to keep it refilled. Price wise, be ready to part with your money for dining there. The food is rather expensive for the dishes there but that’s the price to pay for clean, hygienic and well decorated food. An average of 4 stars

We were greeted with a dish of Fried Fish Skin, an appetizer which immediately cemented our approval. It was only upon paying the bill when we found out that the appetizer was not free, but we had no regrets in paying for it. It would have been much better if we were told that it was not free, but then again, such was the practice of most restaurants.Done with the appetizers, we were promptly served with the rest of the meals, the next following the previous one, the timing neither early nor too late. This was another point which raised my opinion of dining in Bosses, for I really felt that I was served like a boss.All of the dishes which were served were quite impressive, each one earning an accolade from us. We had sampled the sweet, the tangy and the salty, most of them in mixtures of more than one taste, each leaving a lingering taste and a longing heart. From the tender scallop to the crunchy bean curd, from the exotic shark cartilage soup to the ordinary fried rice, from the sweet dessert to the slightly tangy mango sauce, it was truly a sensuous experience for a diner, challenging my taste buds and endurance from asking for more

A good chinese restaurant in Vivocity with a decent vegetarian option . Went there for dinner and found the quality of food from starters to main course to be uniformly good . Service is quick and unobstrusive , and they were quite happy to accomodate our 16 month old son .The starters , especially the fried chicken was of very high quality and amongst the best we had in our stay in Singapore . The main pot rice was enough for 4 of us , and served in excellent independent portions as well .one great plus point is it has three - four dishes that any vegetarian can eat . well worth stopping by after shopping at Vivocit

A moderate priced chinese restaurant located at VivoCity which is good if you are planning to visit Sentosa before that and yet want to avoid exorbitant food prices there. Also ideal for a lunch/tea break from your shopping.We ordered, siew mai, har gow, dinosaur rice rolls, taro dumplings, fried radish cake and a pot of tea to share.-At Harbourfront MRT so location is perfect for those using public transport-serves a variety of chinese food and dimsum-service is good but not over the top as they seemed rather busy being short handed-food tasted slightly above average but I do not like the fried items as much as the steamed items.-ambience is average but do grab the seats that have a view of sentosaSpecific items review-fried fish skin (costs 3.80, don't be mistaken that this is complimentary) 4.5/5. Crispy and not fishy-siew mai 4/5 (big and fresh prawns)-har gow 4/5 (big sized)-dinosaur 3.5/5 (skin is a bit thick)-taro dumpling with scallops 3/5 (the yam filling is slightly hard)-fried radish cake 4.5/5 (yummy)-the tea leaves they used are not of great qualityWe went after 2pm on Saturday and enjoyed 30% of the prices. It costs only 43SGD for two person so is good value for money. I may visit this restaurant if I am at the shopping centre but I won't make a trip with this in mind

We ate many times at Bosses. Yes, Bosses hasn´t the choice of Crystal Jade or other chains, but its charme is much deeper. At lunch, you should try the pineapple dim sum, or indulge in the Queen of Shu Mai dim sums. It is not too expensive, and for once a different place
4
Nice food in a lovely setting. Good view over to Sentosa. Can't comment on cost as I wasn't paying but the food was certainly nice. A little delay with the beers on arrival so 4 stars not 5 . Nice ambiance and busy which I think is usually a good sign
4
Felt the style of food in bosses is different from those you usually found in Chinese restaurants. I especially like one of the duck dish that the meat peels so easily from the bones. The salted egg custard bun is one of our favourites. Great view and loved it has its own toilet compared to other restaurants in the building

We were a bit jaded of our usual haunts at Paradise Inn and Crystal Jade chains, so decided to try this supposedly advant-garde restuarant in Vivocity. Decor was dark and moody,,,service comprising of young staff can never compare with the warmth and attention of the old staff at Crystal Jade.Nevertheless, we sat down to try all the signature dishes;1) Stewed pork - supposed to be so soft that it melts in your mouth,,,,,well we are not sure whether we need to have acid in the mouth first 'cos the skin was so tough, we ended up eating only the lean and fatty part and cutting out the skin,,,,sauce was alright in a claypot but for a signature dish, this wouldnt have any chef signing off on it. I could have gotten better ones at Westlake at half the price,,,,, when a restaurant annoints a dish as its signature, it has to ensure it gets it right (both the meat quality and the cooking process) consistently,,,,no off days and no iffs,,,,'cos if signature is bad, rest is history. And here it is bad.2) Fried rice was lacklustre. Not dry, no wok-hei, no fragrance. My maid on a good day probably can do better.3) the Queen of Siew Mai is as advertised, Aussie-sized siew mai with a whole prawn on top. Too much meat,,,,this is like eating delicate sushi the size of a spring-roll. Suddenly you realise, more is not good for everything. So much meat and the prawn doesnt add anything to the taste other than the visual impact and doubling up the price of the siew mai.4) Tofu with shimeiji mushrooms were the saving grace,,,,5) And their signature desert - the custard buns with hot lava-like custard oozing out with every bite,,,,agree on the lava and the oozing out but the custard bun flour was not well-mixed and it tasted course. Mixed with the lava custard, felt like eating fine sand with egg yolk,,,,,so much for another signature. We ordered 4 and left 2 on the table.A big letdown

The dim sum here is more expensive but bigger portion. The taste, design are funny and less varieties . The dim sum was not hot enough while serving. I will not going back for dim sum again.
4
Friends took us when we visited Singapore recently. The food and service is excellent but very expensive. The decor is dark but nice and we had a table looking over the water to Sentosa.
4
If you're looking for contemporary chinese cuisine, this is the place to check it out. A little pricier but the food is good, ambience is great (nice view of the water) and lightning fast service

Tried only their dimsum. Superb~ Esp the custard buns :)

Good Dim Sum! Fresh and good ingredients.

Dim sum is good.

great food and decor........but the hole in your pocket will hurt

The portion is really BOSS-sized! My eyes almost popped out when my rice was served! And it's boss-priced! But the durian mochi was good as recommended.

Excellent for Dim Sum & La Mien ....
