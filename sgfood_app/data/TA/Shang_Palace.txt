Nice environment, nice foods, will definitely will visit again. Its for business lunch overall is good

Came here to celebrate our mother's birthday. Food choices aplenty albeit at higher cost, but the quality of food and staff service made up for it. worth the visit
4
We have reunion gathering on 10-Feb in Shang Palace. The dishes is very good...
Good choice and we will visit again
3
Had lunch at Shang Palace but was disappointed with the lack of service even though the restuarant was not full and tim sum was ordinary.
4
The ambience and service are always the reasons why I often return to the Shang Palace !
The opulence, and yet relaxing mood is sevond to none.
3
It had been a while since we had a meal at The Shang Palace and suffice to say, it will be a long while before we will think about going back. The dim-sum offerings were limited and though they tried up the ante by going away from the traditional look and plating, flavour was lacking. At the premium prices - that we were prepared to pay - we went away disappointed.
1
Service staff are very slow and made guests wait very long, for food and bill. We need to remind them to serve the food and change our plate since they are dirty. Food quality are not up to standard to other 4 - 5 stars hotels
2
We were there to celebrate CNY as a company, so we ordered yusheng. I was surprised to see that smoked salmon was used, instead of fresh salmon. Also, the ingredients for the toss tasted like that of supermarket DIY variety. I had expected more from a hotel restaurant kitchen, but maybe I was mistaken
5
Had dinner multiple times at this restaurant during my stay in Singapore. Good menu with great chefâ€™s specials - wide range of ingredients and cooking style . Service - very friendly yet very attentive by well trained staff. Not a cheap place to dine but great restaurant if you want to have quality dining experience with hospitality

The Shangri La hotel's stunning cathedral scale hotel lobby has had an extensive contemporary make over to great effect, but I'm pleased to report it's adjacent Shang Palace restaurant has retained its familiar traditional look and, judging from our enjoyable meal, it has also maintained a compelling level of service and excellent cuisine. To be recommended

Pleasant experience at Shang Palace. The dim sum is quite delicate and ambient is super good. But con side
5
This restaurant never fails, food is always so good. Quality and speed at which the food is served is fantastic.
Only it took a while for our drinks to get served. But over all, whether vegetarian or other wise you will get your fix here.
5
The quality of food, service level and speed of food delivering are all perfects. It is highly recommended to visit here.
5
The dim sum at Shang Palace is excellent. Besides the usual dim sum dishes, there are unique dishes like beetroot and asparagus dumpling. There are 3 seatings on Sundays and it is always advisable to book in advance.
5
Our first visit to Singapore. We each got a tasting menu and shared each dish. Everything was excellent and no two dishes were at all the same! A nice leisurely well paced meal. There were a lot of courses but they were well sized. One of the best meals we've ever had.
4
It was my DILs 40th Birthday. We all arrived at 7 pm. It started well with the staff being intrusive as they are always in a Chinese Restaurant. They took our order for Chinese tea and Wines. When the waiter brought the wine he did not know how to pour it .He poured it like Chinese Tea splattering it.Our first course arrived quickly and then we waited for nearly 45 minutes for each of our main dish to arrive. Each took so long that the rice was getting cold and so were the other dishes. We had to chase the staff for each and everything.They were very polite but were definitely understaffed for this sort of restaurant. The food was excellent but the service patheti

We stayed at the hotel and decided to dine at Shang Palace by recommendation from the hotel staff. The service was very good and we got a private room just for our company of 9 persons. The menu is rather extensive and our waiter was helpful in helping us choose several dishes that we shared. The dishes arrived as they were ready and the tea was filled up troughout the meal. The food was very nice; we were happy with everything that we ordered. The only complaint is that it was very cold! After a while I went to check the AC control in our room - and it was set to 15 degrees Celsius!! Needless to say, I took matters into my own hands and turned it up to 22 degrees..
5
I came here with the family. This has to be one of the best dim sum places in Singapore, in terms of quality of food, presentation, creativity, ambience, service and in no particular order. Where has this place been all my life!? Every bite is pure heaven. The picture below is the lobster and seafood dumpling soup. I am going back to taste the rest of the menu. On another note, we had this amazing tea Shoumei? (Something like that). Yeah.... it sells for $98 per 100 g.
5
Had a family dim sum lunch at Shang Palace and was not disappointed at all. The food was excellent and the service the best we had during our holidays in Singapore. We were there from 1.30 pm till 4 and at no time did any staff make any hint for us to leave. Green tea was even served at 4pm. Only thing I can fault is the interior which I thought does not come in line with the excellence food and service. Pricey but overall felt it was worth it.
5
My wife brought my mother-in-law from Medan to visit the newly renovated Shangri-la hotel. They stayed on for lunch at Shang Palace last week. The tim sum was so delicious that they came back a second time this week. She ordered Hau Kow, Siew Mai with abalone, pan fried carrot cake, steamed carrot cake, spring roll, chicken feet (a delicacy) black egg porridge, wu kok, pan siew pau and almond dessert. Next time you think of eating tim sum, come to Shang Palace at the Shangri-la Hotel
2
Took too long to serve the tea and food. No apologies at all. The food is just so so.
It is over priced for the service and quality of food.
5
Shang Palace is a great place to relax and have a good Chinese meal. The staff are attentive and the food is consistently good. The restaurant can be very busy at times but the staff are always make it a point to ensue you are well look after while waiting for your food to arrive
5
We ordered their char siew, stuffed crab shell, XO fried carrot cake and some Tim sum. As for dessert, we had unsweetened almond tea and walnut pastry with lotus seed paste. The food was 6 stars. Compliments to the Chef and team. Compliments to all the service team especially to Ching Yee and young lady with glasses- 6 stars service.
5
On a busy Saturday night, I and a friend treated ourselves to a classic Chinese banquet at the Shang Palace at the Shangri-La Hotel just off Orchard Rd.Any boy was it excellent.An excellent Chinese feast to round out the day!The appetiser plate was a soft succulent prawn with a passion fruit glaze, crispy duck and an egg white and crab mix.The cod and prawn dishes were delicious with the cod a stand out with its rich almost fruity glaze.The quail and beef were rich and yummy with the beef hitting you with a Szechuan pepper bite.The fried rice with a slice of abalone was wonderful yet a touch too rich.The final desserts were an almond soup with a yakult flavoured pannacotta style dish, pretty damn good.Overall an excellent meal with mixes of Asian and European flavours and an evening to remember
5
I had a meal here when visiting Singapore recently. The restaurant room is impressive in a superb hotel, The Shangri-La. The Peking duck was superb. The staff could not have been more helpful in advising me on what choices to make and the service was efficient and friendly. It isn't cheap but well worth it for a special occasion
5
We have been at the Shang Palace last week Friday evening; and it was as always a great experience, specifically due to the great service provided by Ms Chai Fong. From the reservation to the check all went extremely well, and the food was delicious again. We will come back, for sure!Prof Rem

restaurant Is probably in the midst of changing menu, a few A4 size paper been stapled together worst than a kopi tiam tze char. No photo and not placed in a folder. Unbelievable for such a 5star Restaurant. Canâ€™t find the taste I used to in my previous visit, Peking Duck is cold. Good service is compensated with poor foo

Went with wife for dim sum at @11.05am Sunday. There was no problem getting a table for 2 persons without a reservation although I would suggest making a reservation if you have a group of 4 or more, especially on Sundays when Shang Palace opens at 11am.Greeting: Polite.Food: We had only dim sum as we didn't want to over-eat. We ordered 7 kinds, viz. Har Kow w. scallop & caviar, Siew Mai w mini abalone, Siew Mai with ebiko, steamed lotus leaf glutinuous rice, phoenix claws (aka chicken feet); har gow, steamed rice rolls with char siew centre and Herbal Jelly. We also ordered take away for family member at home (century egg & pork congee, siew mai, steamed rice roll with char siew and egg custard tarts).Overall, food was of good quality. The two varieties of siew mai tasted a bit similar. The Har Gow was underwhelming and without any USP taste factor, tasting exactly like minced prawns. The lotus leaf rice was quite refined in texture and taste. The herbal jelly was refreshing and pretty good. We chose Lung Ching (dragon well) Chinese tea to complement lunch.Service: Polite & attentive generally. There was no need to ask the waitstaff to top up our tea cups but we did have to ask a waiter to change our used plates for a fresh one.Price: @$135. Fairly reasonable for the amount of food we ordered.Conclusion: Dim Sum standard is above average. Perhaps a little more variety in the Dim Sum menu would be good
4
We decided for the fix menu silver something. For 82 dollars.The starters weren't special. Really something you can get better at home ( Italy in my case). The soup fish was ok.It's with the main courses that we started to get something more serious.The fish was great and also the duck.The desert, lychees pudding was ok.The service was ok, maybe a little bit more formal than what we got in other places here in Singapore
4
Shangri-la is an institution when it comes to hotels and good service. The moment we stepped into the hotel lobby, the doormen were helpful and courteous. The restaurant itself is decorated in a Chinoserie style, classy but with a deep red hue.The lunch menu is extensive with a decent vegetarian selection. The prices are towards the steeper end but compatible with the surroundings, service and food quality. The captain was helpful with adjusting the menu to suit a vegetarian diet. There are at least 3-5 different types of vegetarian dim sum as well as a page of vegetarian dishes. Of note is the mixed vegetables served in a pumpkin, unique in both presentation and taste. The desserts were delicious. Suitable for a family gathering or a celebration
5
This place is always busy day & night mainly with locals which is a good sign. Service is very efficient & friendly. Not cheap by any means but food is delicious. Highly recommend lobster dumpling soup,crispy barbque pork, steamed dumplings. Always excellent & fresh.
5
This restaurant is located in the Shangri-La Hotel. It serves some of the best Chinese food you will ever eat.
3
A solo dinner at this authentic Chinese restaurant. But Disappointed with the taste. It took more than 30 minutes to serve the food. Abby the Chinese girl provided an excellent service. The menu too was not attractive. Unlikely to visit again.
5
Yesterday was my dad's birthday! We had a celebration at the Shang palace. The food were amazing, nothing to pick on to be honest. In fact, I'm more overwhelmed by the staff effort in creating a memorable birthday celebration for my dad as well as our friends. The services they have provided are truly from the bottom of their heart, we can feel the sincerity, I can only said that their effort is commendable. The dining room was well decorated with rose petals. What wow me most was the decoration on the wall and the wine glass. On the wall, "附录东海，寿比南山” refers to Birthday blessing in Chinese as well as the wine glasses, all of them were stick with the Chinese word - longevity. We truly appreciated the service provided by the team and requested to take a picture with the staff to remember this special occasion.This is what hospitality is and I would say Shang Palace have many true service personnel. I would like to share my experience as I hope many others will be able to feel and experience what my family and friends have received.A warmth place to dine at with fantastic hoteliers from the Shang palace team and great food by the chefs!Will be returning again and spread the words of mouth!On a side note: I do not like yam but their Yam Ring is to die for!!!!!!!!!
4
Shang Palace is located in the very elegant Shangri La hotel. I have dined there a few times and it has always been very good indeed. The service is at a level commensurate with this 5-star hotel - attentive but not intrusive. There is a variety of menu options; a la carte, banquets etc. The a la carte menu is extensive and you would be very fussy indeed not to find something agreeable. The restaurant also features an extensive wine list, though it is at pricey end. The food is good value for money, but this is not street food and so you should expect to pay $30+ for a plate
4
This is one of fhose restaurants that we grew up with. It's been around for decades and still has its classic old feel despite the massive renovation of re rest of the hotel. I like this place for dim sum. The food is always good quality but not as innovative as Summer Pavilion or Summer Palace
4
Shang Palace have 2 seatings for weekend. Reserve in advance for 15% discount. Currently there is a 30% off dim sum for online reservation for week end and public holiday 1st seating (1100-1215). Bill came to around $75 for 3 people including tea and cashew nut. Service is good with frequent change of plates. The dim sum rate 4 for taste and 5 for presentation. The above market price is compensated by the use of higher value ingredients, such as scallop for siew mai. Egg tart is highly recommended. Overall highly value of money with promotion
2
Been here on 2 different occasions with my kids on staycations.The food is good as you would except from a 5 star hotel. I don't think there will be a 3rd visit though, after pretty much disappointed by the service. The staff seemed really busy (at one occasion, impatient). Many times, had to stand and made myself more visible. Bill took really long, and while waiting for the bill, saw a staff overflowing a glass of champagne at the next table with the 3 guests so amused by the way it was topped up.Price wise, decent. But if I were to really dine here again, I would probably choose to have it in the room. Been to many Chinese restaurants in other hotels, this is probably one of the most disappointing ones.
4
When you walk into this Shang Palace you really are amazed by the impressive decor and design of the restaurant. It's simply beautiful. The service was excellent. We just made the wrong choice of set menu and got a lot of dishes my husband didn't like. We should have gone for the Peking duck as was recommended to us by our niece. It was our choice of menu and unfortunately not to our liking. But we will give this Shang Palace a second try on our next visit to Singapore.
5
My wife and I dined at Shang Palace and were extremely impressed by the quality of the food, the authentic decoration and ambience as well as the high level of service. Special thanks to Abby for her detailed knowledge of the food on the menu and friendly approach. The dim sum selection were superb as were the main courses. The lemon chicken was simply amazing. The desserts were both tasty and visual works of art. The tea selection is also very impressive. All in all we were very impressed and would highly recommend this restaurant for an evening meal. Prices are also excellent value, including the extensive wine list
4
Love the variety of dim sums which makes it quite fun and interesting. We ordered congee which was a massive disappointment, do avoid. Service is good and a real enjoyable lunch.
4
The service in Shang Palace is excellent. Though food is pricey but with such great service, ppl are willing to pay.
4
Great dinner here. We ordered several dishes to share. Baked cod fish. Wagyu beef. All food was wonderful! Loved the fish the most. I'd recommend it!
5
Awesome and delicious lunch with business partners... with reservation through chope was easy and convenient.
4
Fine dining pricing that is well worth its dime. the quality of dim sum here is excellent. Service is legendary.
5
A wonderful dinner. Food was amazing and the service was superb. Very tasty and flavor some. Awesome.
5
We like Shangri-la Hotel for the space and tranquillity and good food and tea (they pay special attention to the type of tea) at Shang Palace.They pay attention to the settings with wet towels, a change taste bud drink, XO sauce and cloth over your expensive bags. We particularly like the pumpkin and the ice cream dessert in a coconut, jelly and ice cream toppings among the range of exquisite dishes they served.We recommend you to must try their tim sum lunch and do call to make the reservations to avoid disappointment
5
I went here for a work dinner and the service was fabulous. It is located in the spectacular Shangri La hotel. The food was elegant and full of flavour. Portion sizes were perfect for me, but if you are a large eater I would suggest another place.Definitely good for small or large groups
5
This is the first time we celebrated our anniversary at the Shang and we're utterly pleased. Great food, very pleasant ambience and outstanding service. A complimentary cake presented at the end by the effortlessly graceful host (too nice to refer to as service staff) topped it all.Perfection was modulated by renovation work at the Tower wing, even though it did nothing to subtract from the restaurant. Thankfully it'll be completed by May 16
5
2nd time back to Shang Palace for meal, and it's always a comfortable feeling to be there. As always, the captains and crews had more elegant touch and friendliness when offering recommendations of dishes as compared with other restaurants.Tea lovers will liken the wide selection of tea that they offer.They have more than 10 selections if I remember correctly.Main dishes were finely prepared, served warm and on-time.Cream of avocado, chocolate ice cream is uniquely different, and recommended to diners with a sweet tooth
5
You are at home whether you entertain or use this place as a venue for a meal. The staffs do not frown no matter how you dress or if you have a hyper active child.
5
Even with the current renovations going on in Shangri-la, it did not detract from the nice meals that I always have at Shang Palace.
The service is attentive. Food is high quality.
5
Absolutely superb quality! Hot plate fried rice was so yummy! We stuck to the signature dishes n we didn't go wrong!
3
We used our Shangri La Golden Circle points dining at Shang Palace. The food selection as well as the quality of all meals was outstanding and i fou d the pricelevel compared to other restaurants in Singapore at ok levelHowever the service was way below the standard keeping in mind that the restaurant only had 4 tables reserved during our early dinner time:- i had to pour tea to my wife as nobody came for refill - waiters seeing me doing this didnt spark any action nor apology- service time and attitude towards us not great keeping in mind this is the best restaurant at Shangri La- while exiting the restaurant nearby Ballroom people came to hush us out as there was a event ongoing - strange behavoir keeping in mind we didnt make any noise at al
5
We welcomed by a very friendly lady and this continued throughout the meal with other members of staff.We had the fish tasting menu consisting of 7 courses (I think!).Small portions (perfect as many courses),each one beautifully presented,great fun trying different tastes and textures - would definitely recommend.Very nice bottle of rose from Jodie and Pitt vineyard
5
We had Dim Sim for lunch. The waiter helped us order and pointed out their specialities. We had a couple of Singaporeans with us and they also said it was the best Dim Sim served. A real treat! Excellent service! They also helped us with the right tea to drink with our meal. Reservations a must
2
Went to go have buffet but was turned away by rather rude staff as it was busy , used to be such a nice special coffee shop with a great buffet , now just a.noisy cafeteria , nothing special . Went to Shang palace for dim sum , which was nice , staff a little better and attentive , but the mood experience was spoilt . Shangrila not what it used to be quire ckearly and I've downgraded it to a 3/4 star establishment due to recent experiences there
4
We opted for one of the prix fix menu options: Silver Needle (not sure why they would call it this....) for S$85 per person. It had a number of courses, one of which included Jellyfish tentacles which I suspect are a delicacy and maybe an acquired taste. The service was good and the atmosphere was well above average. Because of a major renovation in this part of the hotel, there was a slight aroma of chemicals in the restaurant. Renovations should be complete by May 2017
4
I usually eat here whenever I stay at a Shangri La hotel. I wasn't disappointed. The service is quick, food hot and delicious. I was checked on several times during my meal and my tea constantly refilled. I was given recommendations and informed about my points being added to my room and discount to my meal for being a golden circle member. The appetizer was delicious, soup yummy and main dish outstanding. I will always eat here no matter what hotel I stay at
5
Peking duck was as good as 30 years ago. Now also new approach by the chefs - the recommended fish earned full point
5
Shang Palace offers one of the best Chinese food in town. It's upmarket so expect to pay a higher price. Great service as well.
5
we were met by the very friendly staff and manager who were all very attentive and recommended/helped us decide on what to eat, which was SO tasty
4
Back here after many years. Food was good. Peking duck and the truffle oil mushroom is a must try! The server was attentive.
5
I had a party of six people. I had ordered the food ahead of time. The service was excellent. The food was delicious and the restaurant was pleasant and quiet.I highly recommend this restaurant
4
We visited and ate at Shang Palace with a table of 7 including two small children. The food was delicious, we ordered a lot of family style, that sat on the lazy susan, so never hard to reach. They brought tea out and a refreshing small glass of hibiscus juice. Yummy! The Shangri-la hotel is under construction, so you do have to reach the entrance of the hotel and then walk outside along a path to get to the restaurant because of the construction, but it was an adventure
5
Easy parking, easy to get a booking compared to the other restaurants in Orchard area. Excellent service as you are in a hotel.
3
Have always enjoyed dining at Shang Palce but must say the latest experience was somewhat disappointing. The restaurant was fairly well patronised despite the ongoing renovations which seemed promising. However, service standards and quality has clearly suffered from their relocation. The food seemed to be served in a hurry with the next dish arriving even before the we were midway through the previous dish (we had the set menu) such that the food was cold by the time we started on it - wouldn't have expected this in a restaurant like Shang Palace. At times they seemed a little understaffed and even when there was less of a dining crowd later in the evening, the staff were not very attentive. Hopefully things will improve going forward
1
hotel is under renovation and the restaurant is suffering from the noise and vibration as well as poor air conditioning.this seems to have impacted the quality of food (everything was bland) and the service which was unresponsive (plates were not changed; waiter couldn't tell one soup from another etc)
5
Stayed at the Shangri-La hotel and the Concierge recommended the Shang Palace. Must say, was apprehensive but the experience was rally good and the food was nice. Service was a bit slow, but that was because they were fully booked. Loved the Prawn. They also serve a small Tea at the beginning which is nice
4
We had a late evening reservation for dinner, which was not optimal. We learned that you must call as soon as you arrive in Singapore for a dinner time as the slots fill quickly.The food was great, especially the dumplings, and the service was also very good
4
Came here for dim sum lunch with family, good food at reasonable prices. The surprise birthday cake to go was a nice touch!
4
This place serves good dim sum in Singapore. Service is also good ... Ambience is nice... Except hotel is a little far off Orchard road.
4
I prefer Shang palace for dim sum when it has a buzz. Overall good but not standing out as there are many good dim sum places in Singapore. However it is reliable enough if u stay here at shangrila why not eat here?!
3
Being located in one of the top hotels in Singapore once might expect both more or get what you expect. The food here is decent but the service could really be better
5
Dim Sum for lunch and their Signature meals for dinner is a great way to begin and end your day at the Shangri-La.Their staff is super, so attentive and gracious! My special shout out to Lyn, Xi Hui and James for making my lunch and dinner memorable. Do save some space for their Signature dessert: Avocado sago ice-cream
5
This delightful classy Chinese restaurant with food to match is always worth a visit. Peking Duck a specialit
5
I love this Restaurant ! in one of the most beautiful Hotels in Singapore, the Shangri-La, the ambiance is unique, elegant and modern, a central common area and several private rooms to let you feel comfortable, a vast and comprehensive Menu that can accommodate any taste.The service is more than excellent and the timing is perfect.Is the prefect place for a romantic dinner but at the same time can be used for larger events or business meetings.Great wine listI have been there all the times i go back to Singapore and i will definitely continue in the future
4
I had lunch in this restaurant the day I arrived in Singapore. I didn't have a reservation and just walked in. The staff were kind enough to accommodate me and get me a table. The choice of dishes were varied and the food was great! The lady attending me was very friendly and took very good care of me. Would love to go back to this restaurant when I stay in Shangri-La again
4
Restaurant atmosphere is great with touch of classy red crystal chandeliers. Dim sum selection is good with refreshing lychee taste accented dishes. Service staff short handed for morning dining, allocate more staff is recommended
4
We ordered half peking duck. Duck was flavorful, and the manager was very accomodating to serve the duck two ways: skin with pancake, meat with noodles and even cut the drumstick off for us to eat on its own! unfortunately, our experience was somewhat dampened by the fact that they seemed short staff and we had to ask for every thing 2 times: high chair, water, service...overall, we would give them another chance and return agai
5
This restaurant is a great example of regional Chinese cuisine. The reasonably priced meals were brought out in good time and were devoured in equally quick time. The service could not be faulted.
3
First - the price level. I don't recall paying 16$++ for a bottle of water ever before. The Waterfall restaurant in the same hotel charges 5$, where is the logic? It must be the "palace" experience, I guess. The food served was well prepared but lacked completely taste. Even oyster sauce was diluted into large amount of thick tasteless soup. Portions are tiny, the personnel lacks knowledge about what they serve. If your dish is described as "lobster and young ginger noodles" then this is what comes, no other vegetables, just a tiny bowl of boiled noodles with lobster belly in it. Extremely difficult to eat lobster from deep dish of noodles. Presentation of the dish vshows lack of effort and fantasy. From all the restaurants in Shangri La this is my least favourite one, and quite surprising the most expensive one. Thy The Waterfall for Mediterranean , try The Line for taste if the world, try hawker stores in SGP for tasty Chinese kitchen, but skip the "palace experience" in Shang
4
We were pleased we tried this restaurant. We had the set dinner menu Snow Flake on the Green Lake ... we chose it for its intriguing name : ) and we were not disappointed. Each course was artistically presented and a delight to the palate. The service was prompt, efficient and polite. Will return when we are next in Singapore
4
Enjoyed a very quick lunch here, whilst staying at the Shangri-la hotel. Fairly traditional chinese food. The dim sum were delicious. Wait staff were incredible attentive - almost too much so. At times I felt rushed because as soon as I had finished a course my plate disappeared and a new one arrived. Difficult to relax and fully enjoy in the circumstances
1
Came at about 1:30pm after one night stay. Do you have reservation? Are you guest of the hotel? Asked the staff at the door. You know, like there's a long queue waiting. When in fact the restaurant was nearly empty. Shown to a table, then the captain promptly disappeared. No one came for at least 15 minutes. Decided on some vegetarian dishes. After 10 minutes a server came with 2 teeny cup of red liquid. "Hibiscus tea", she said, "welcome drinks". Whether this was welcome to the restaurant, or to the hotel which was not served when we checked in, was not mentioned. Was it made in-house, I wanted to know. She had to ask a supervisor. The dumpling which arrived after 10 minutes was sticky and tasteless. The taro cake after another 15 minutes was also sticky and tasteless. The teeny bowl of noodle which came after another 20 minutes was sticky and tasteless. Then we were left to wait. And wait. And wait. And we were not the only table kept waiting.After another 15 minutes we decided perhaps the kitchen crew need to be recalled from their break. One captain came, said she would check, didn't return. After 10 minutes, we called a server over. Please cancel the rest of the dishes, please ask what happen to the noodle. Perhaps this time the tone of voice was pitched correctly. The fried noodle appeared literally immediately. No apology.No longer in the mood, we called for the bill. Another 10 minutes. In the bill was some nuts which we didn't order and was never served. What is this? I asked. Oh, nuts were served at the beginning, the server said. I decided enough with the poor service. No, there were no nuts. Kindly take out the nut, take out the noodle which we were no longer in the mood to consume, kindly come back with the correct bill in 1 minute. This time it was the captain who came. But still no attempt at apology.Time I cut up my golden circle card
5
I must have dined at the Shang Palace at least fifteen times during the past six years. It consistently serves good food and the service is platinum standard. Top of our must-eat dishes include roast suckling pig, roast duck, crispy pork, crab meat egg white stir-fired and steamed fish (any fish). The noodles and fried rice dishes are also good and delicious. Highly recommended for those who want to eat good chinese food in Singapore. This is not a cheap restaurant. So be prepared to pay about $100 per person
4
I did try Dim Sum here with my family once in our trip last year and it definitely becomes one of the best Dim Sum restaurants in town. The location is easy to find as it stays right at the lobby of Shangri-La hotel. I very much like the dining area and staff services - quick, professional recommendations and especially quiet (We went there at around 10:30 AM on Sunday). Ha-Kau is very tasty with thin layer outside
5
This is a place for very good Chinese food. No ifs and no buts the food is fantastic. It is a traditional setting and it is not modern or anything like that but of you want comfortable, top class Chinese restaurant and happy to pay for it then I'd come here.
5
For a hotel restaurant and in particular for the Shangri-La group this is one of their best restaurants I have dined in. I am a regular global Shangri-La hotel guest and some of the restaurants in Sydney and Abu Dhabi have fallen short of expectation for this group. But the Shang Palace proved to be a winner. Yes it's expensive but the ingredients are top notch, fresh, varied and the menu is extensive. Service was helpful, polite and professional. Excellent wine list. I was able to try foods not previously on other menus.
5
We are having some guest from overseas which we would like to treat them with some nice Chinese cuisine. Shang Palace is a nice place for us to present them the nice Chinese cuisine. All of the dishes is nice and our guest enjoyed the dinner very much.
5
Have been frequenting this fine restaurant for many years & an old favourite. Food is fantastic , fresh & beautifully prepared & presented. Service also first class. Great atmosphere & quiet.
Recommend the suckling pig , mango rice paper rolls & steamed dumplings.
3
Been here before. Always my fav. This time service was poor attitude terrible and even lipstick stain on spoon. They apologised proffered "free" dessert - only to charge it on the bill! Took forever to find someone to correct the mistake. Disappointed.
5
If there is one restaurant in Shangrila that I will always come back to -it would be the Shang. Food is really great. And service is impeccable.
4
This restaurant has been around for a long time and going by its look, it must been up dated several times. It is a popular place for yan cha and it goes by several slots in the afternoon.
4
This eatery served good dim sums..flavourful, quality ingredients and fresh.. Service was attentive and prompt..dining room ambiance was pleasant..Well, worth giving it a go..
5
Absolutely amazing, our maitre'd talked us through the menu, the food was fantastic, the service second to none. You must try this restaurant

Four of us spent a most memorable evening here. We were welcomed by a lovely lady who was very helpful in guiding our choices through the enormous and unusual menu. Result was an exquisite dining experience from the BBQd meats (don't miss them) through lamb, chicken and beef dishes, the like of which I have never before had the pleasure to taste. On first glance at the menu it appeared pricey, but we were extremely well fed for a very reasonable price given the quality of the fayre

This infamous restaurant, SHANG PALACE, created day one by the SHANGRILA Hotel; and carries the name to all SHANGRILA hotels world wild. The cuisine is mainly Cantonese; and it is more known for the "DIM SUM". The ambience is good, as it is in one of the top hotel; so is the service. The quality and choice are acceptable; but the prices are high! DO experience this top DIM SUM outlet and review it yourself
5
Picked a set menu and did not like one of the starters so waiter changed at no extra cost and explained the different dishes in detail to us. This was a nice touch as we were trying new thingsVery good service and the food was deliciou
4
Our group of 4 had the Chinese New Year set menu for $158 pp After taxes it came to $190 pp. An equivalent meal can be got more reasonably priced else where but of course this is the Chinese Restaurant in The Shangrila Hotel. The food was delicious and well cooked.The service was good too. No fantastic decor or ambiance though.
5
We had a great dinner at this elegant restaurant located in the Shangri-la Hotel. The food was excellent and the service was friendly and efficient. As we were hotel guests, we even had a 20% discount which was a nice surprise. Excellent restaurant.
5
Still to this day the best Cantonese cuisine I've ever experienced!
Everything was exceptional.............. Food, Service, Wine, Decor and when we were here there was a mask changing production it was outstanding theatre!
5
This was almost cancelled after our Nadaman experience. Thankfully we didn't as the Peking duck was to die for. Great food and would dine again
3
Its smaller than expected, hence it fills up, long wait for seating. As its in my hotel I dropped in on a not so busy day and couldn't be accommodated. The next time I made a reservation for 3 hours ahead. The hostess liked that. It appears she runs the place.The food was almost as good as the Chinese portion of the hotel's buffet.The service just doesn't fit in this hotel's atmosphere
4
Loved everything we ordered at this place, the selection was great, the staff were great. By far the best restaurant in the Shangri La hotel
4
This restaurant is part of the Shangri-la hotel but open to all. Food was delicious and there was also an extensive and good wine list. The maitre d' advised us on best combinations and reined in the scale of our ordering... probably concerned for indigestion ! The barbecue pork belly starter was the highlight and all other dishes from clay pot chicken through to lobster noodles were all very good.
3
Dined few times at the Shang Palace during my stay at Shangri-La Apartments. The food was pretty average and I made a bad choice of dining there on New Year's Eve with a friend - when the fixed menu option turned out to be atrocious given the price I paid for it!!However, the saving grace was their attentive service and I would like to make special mention of Bella, who made the otherwise mundane meal tolerable with her impeccable and ever smiling attentive service! Kudos to her for surviving in an otherwise commonplace restaurant, in a city which stands out as one of the gastronomical delights in the world.

Shang Palace in Singapore used to be our family favorite restaurant, as my children stared eating here at very young age, so we all have very fond memories of this place. But unfortunately the last few years it has a restaurant manager that is relatively cold and stem, so we came much less than before.With new year holiday, we decided to revisit Shang Palace again, we never get disappointment with the food here, always delicious and very finely done. But today we were pleasantly surprised to meet a new restaurant manager, who spend quite a long time talking to us, in general subjects or feedback from us etc, the conversations were warm and friendly, that certainly add to the pleasure of eating in a restaurant.We ordered 4 dim sum items, one soup dish, one fried green and signature stone pot fried rice, all were really nice, particularly the stone pot fried rice is highly recommended.
5
Great food and lovely staff who advised on the menu. Would throughly recommend a visit. Try the duck - we had a half, which was a lot for two, but the waiter explained they could use the rest in a second dish, with noodles- which was lovely!
1
If you eat at Shang Palace on the weekends, you only get 100 mins to complete your meal before you get chased out. If you want to have a wham bang thank you ma'am meal, this is the place. Food quality has gone down the drain. The meats used in the xiao long bao and the duck and chestnut stew smelled, ie not good quality meat. The dim sum was sub par but way above par in terms of pricing with dishes averaging $7-8 per dish. All in, we were sorely disappointed with the meal and would not repeat this sub par dining experience
4
Had some traditional Chinese food like dim sum and congee there. Food was decent and service was attentive. The highlight would be the roasted pork, which was absolutely delicious.
5
Glutinous rice in lotus leave with mini abalone should be improved upon as the fishy smell is too strong for liking.
Carrot strip with Foie Gras sound interesting but the taste provides no surprise.
All the basic tim sum taste satisfactory.
4
Great place to have dim sum on a Sunday afternoon. Love the char siew bun, xo carrot cake and avocado ice cream.
Heard they do not used MSG in their cooking.
Attentive service staff - constant change of dirty plate, refilling of tea and water.
4
Fantastic service and very tasty food. Loved the crab and onion soup. The restaurant was quiet and lacked some atmosphere
5
Really enjoyed our meal and appreciated the advice of the waiter who stopped us from over-ordering. Great food, good service and a lovely dining room too. Hope to be back soon!
2
The sister restaurant in Paris is amazing- this pretends to be. Food is basic and thoughtlessly prepared. Price is 5 star food is 2 star. Ambience is nice.
4
Enjoyed the old grand dame...interesting stick pick for choice of tea to start.The timsum variety is good and of high quality. Had several ala carte dishes and enjoyed most of them as expected
5
This was my third time there and I loved it, again. We where 12 people, booked a separate room. They know how to treat their guests like royalty, excellent service from very nice and friendly people. The food is spectacular, maybe also down to my local colleague who knew what to order (I could have done without the birds nest ) I will come again and again..
3
This is my first visit to this posh restaurant. It was very welcoming and the glamorous ambiance and decor set my expectations very high. Very pleasant and relaxing atmosphere in the restaurant. Service was also excellent. Reviewing the menu, I chose the signature dishes hoping to be delighted by the masterful creations of the chef. Alas, I was sorely dissapointed! Half the dishes ordered tasted wonderfully prepared, but the rest of the dishes tasted terrible - the lotus leaf rice was bland, the pork ribs was missing some condiments and flavouring. It was a poor first impression. As the dishes were pricey, I expected a refined dining experience with delightful dishes to tickle my tastebuds. What a let-down! For the money I paid, i would have much better value for the food at other restaurants. Worth a revisit? Am afrraid not
5
We stayed at Shangri-La and we were impressed with the menu, lots of varieties, the service was very efficient, attentive and helpful when we had questions or we were not sure about what to have. I usually do not eat in the hotels unless I'm aware it's a really good restaurant but we were so tired and jetlag, but it was a great surprise, we actually went back there before we left Singapore and we just confirmed the prior experience
5
This restaurant has been one of the leading Chinese restaurants in Singapore for many years .
It is always busy so reservations are essential .
Yum Cha menu is a good quick options .
Food & service is excellent & consistent over many years .
4
Traditional chinese restaurant at Shangri-la hotel, the quality of food is great. We had a set meal and each course was plated to perfection. The fish was excellent as was the prawns. Service was decent and staff was excellent in providing attention to the table's requests, although the restaurant was fairly quiet
5
We arrived early for dim sum lunch and waited for the restaurant to open at 12 noon. Small groups of diners had gathered in the hotel lobby and the restaurant's entrance. We were ushered to a large round table and as we selected our dim sum orders, the restaurant fills up steadily with diners.As usual, dim sum was good and our orders were served progressively. Excellent items included the BBQ pork pastries, char siu baos, siu mai, yam balls, fish porridge, steamed turnip cake and ee fu noodles. The carrot cake in XO sauce takes getting used to.Service was excellent with frequent changes of soiled plates and attentive topping up of tea. Shang Palace's beautiful ambience adds to the dining pleasure
5
Have been going to Shang Palace for a few years and I always find it delicious, fresh and excellent value for money. The ambiance and setting are lovely. More or less on par re price as Crystal Jade. If you book online on their website there is sometimes a discount
4
We are used to have dinner at the Shang Restaurant with our friends whenever we are in Singapore, but this time, we have been really disappointed : the reservation was done badly ; then there was no head waiter, only young waiters who tried their best ! And also no sommelier !!! So we were not really lucky this time.Thanks God, the food was perfect, as usual 
5
We joined friends for dinner whilst on holiday in Singapore. The service was excellent and the choice of meals could not have been better. The whole Peking duck was delicious, the wage beef melt in the mouth and i could go on - with a large party we got to try lots of dishes.The perfect end to the evening was drinks at the Blu bar which has a great view over Singapore - Highly recommende
3
I go here every year, sometimes twice a year when in Singapore and, have been for the past twenty years whilst staying in the Hotel. The food is consistently good but what's really missing is any form of Maitre'D, or Manager who has style, class and charm. It has all become a bit robotic..Also at night for dinner some attention should be paid to dimming the lights and creating a bit more atmosphere, as used to be the case, but my last couple of visits note some slacking and lack of attention to fine details for which Shangri-La is , for me, always known
4
Shang Palace offers a traditional fine dining experience with a sumptuous setting, lavish menu, discreet but attentive wait staff and dishes cooked with a finesse beyond that achieved by most restaurants. We tried the salted duck, apple and honey glazed ribs, seasonal vegetables in garlic and the special fried rice with prawns. We were expecting small dishes but actually they were a good size. Traditional Asian manners were observed with men served first, followed by women and children. The place was fairly empty when we went so the wait staff somewhat annoyingly were queuing up to refill the teapot that had just been refilled. A good experience but for regular meals you'll find me at one of the food halls on Orchard Road
5
Shang Palace offers a great range of Chinese dishes. The standout is the Peking Duck which has excellent skin and the meat served in a seperate dish. The floor manager recommended an off menu dish of Pork and Lychees which was one of the best Chinese dishes I have had in a long time. It isn't the cheapest chinese, its Hong Kong equivalent holds two michelin stars, but it is excellen
5
We came here with family and everyone was delighted. I recommend their specialities, you won't be disappointed. This is an expensive place and well worth it. Good service and mouth-watering food
5
Fabulous, Peking duck, pork belly. lamb shanks. prawns all amazing. staff and food excellent, faultless a must
4
A nice restaurant but nothing to make it amazing. The food was good and the service efficient. There are probably equally as good Chinese restaurants for less cost
5
First class food, service and setting. Private dining rooms also available off the main dining area.
5
Was a good peking duck and we enjoy that kind of service we go again to eat there they even offer discount for appartments guest we appreciate it.
5
Decent dim sum and good pricing. One of the few that I frequent alot of times. Lovely environment to dine in. As usual service was great
5
This is our second visit to Shang Palace more than a year apart. What can we say - it surpassed our expectations in every possible way. To start with - the dining room is a stunning space - with shades of red elegantly adorning every corner. Amazingly, the sommelier remembered us from a year ago and also the wine we has ordered then. The food showed beautiful precision - delicate flavours throughout. Our 5 year old son was looked after so well. And to finish off, a cake was brought out to celebrate our anniversary, albeit belated. A totally wonderful evening we will cherish for a long time. Thank you guys

We arranged dinner here during our stay and unfortunately we coincided with a business booking that was taking up much of the restaurant and staff. We decided upon one of the set menus which happened to be the same as the large group. Our first couple of courses were rushed out, as if to catch us up to everyone else, and we were then in synch with the majority of the room. Fine except we were still treated as straggling add-ones rather than a couple dining separately?! The course chit was kept on our dining table and got ticked off by staff as if working at their desk during our meal? Surely that could have been kept at another area so that we didn't feel like the utility desk. We had wine and sparking water with our meal. We ended up pouring our own wine and one of the waiters blindly topped up our glasses of sparkling water with his jug of tap water.Our food was fine, however, taking into account the prices, I came away feeling disappointed. We continued to get zero attention during our meal, even struggling to acquire our bill at the end whist the large group took 'group photos'. It was as if we weren't there? Perhaps under other circumstances we would have enjoyed a similar experience to what others have here, without being in with another big group. Unfortunately our experience was underwhelming and for the price, we were a bit flat after our evening here. I don't like to write a negative review having not spoken up at the time about our dissatisfaction. However, we couldn't have gained anyone's attention to be able to comment or complain on the night
5
Really good food -we had the tofu and spinach dish, crab and egg white dish and 5 kinds of rice cooked on stone. Loved that there was a wide range of tea to choose from plus the teapot was constantly replenished.Note -the serving sizes are plentiful -we probably would have had an adequate amount for the 2 of us with just the rice and one dish
4
Shang palace is located in Shangai la hotel.It's a very nice Chinese restaurant and serves very good Chinese food.The ambience is quiet and good for both family and business dinners or lunches.As with most things Shangri-la, it's quite pricey but worth it if you got deep pocket
4
The food quality is top-notch, and the ambience of the restaurant is very classy and elegant. Although expensive, this place is great for special occasions such as Chinese New Year, so it is best to book in advance. The mooncakes available here during the mooncake festival are also very delicious and packaged beautifully
5
Attractive environment with delicious Chinese cuisine. Interesting dishes cooked to perfection with great service.
5
4 of us went for lunch - wonderful selection of dim sum of all kinds and attentive service.
Unexpensive considering that this is an elegant hotel restaurant with excellent reviews.
I would strongly recommend.
4
Great service, good food, nice atmosphere. If you are staying at Shangrila Hotel, it should be a must!
5
Delicious food and SUCH a wide choice of menu. Mock chicken was delicious. I advise getting plenty of good and taking some away for later
5
The Shang palace serves very authentic Chinese / Cantonese food with a great service. Variety is excellent even for vegetarians. Price is also reasonable.
5
This is a delightful restaurant, run by knowledgable and helpful staff who will advise on any aspect of the extensive menu. There are set meals at sensible prices and also a great a la carte menu (also reasonably priced) to choose from.We particularly like the way clients can select from a wide range of delicious Chinese teas - a container of slim cards describing each tea is on every table
5
We have just arrived at Shangri-La Orange Grove Road tonight. After a delayed flight, we were looking for a good place to enjoy our dinner. Having read some good review about the restaurant, we tried our luck there :) The place is not so big, having a meal with children might be a bit difficult there since not so much room are available, but I went there with my other two best friends. No worries for us. At first, we were confused what to eat since almost all food seem delicious. However, we were helped by a waiter named Melvin. He suggested us the food in accordance to our tastes. Finally we orderred: pumpkin (instead of rice), crispy chicken, lychee pig, miso fish, asparagus with garlic, and a bowl of chicken soup fr each of us. At first, we thought, we were not going to able to finish it. But you know what, we were simply wrong :) With that much food served before us, we could handled them all since we found the taste to be sooo delicious. The food was served and cooked well, not a heavy seasoning but something fresh and natural. We enjoyed our dinner and would love coming back in the near future
4
We went for a lunch because we had time to kill between checking out and going to the airport. As a result there were few diners and we got excellent service! We were not able to choose from the full menu because of Chinese New Year. Nonetheless there was a good choice and we enjoyed everything we ate. Thoroughly recommended
5
This restaurant is our monthly ritual family dinner date! Peking Duck, Pik Fong Tong Chicken and seafood hot & sour soup on point!Service great especially when they take note of our special requests most of the time...most of the staffs here are friendly, knowledgable and efficient! Keep up the good work Team Shang Palace
4
We have been to the Shang Palace a number of times in the past.This visit was to celebrate the Lunar New Year with close friends.We were seated in a cosy part of the restaurant. Having preordered the menu, the waiting staff were discrete and attentive. The food was very good. One has to try the Cod. We have dined in this restaurant in the past & have had the Cod cooked with miso (a must try, not to be missed) but the new variant coated with vinegar and wok fried was just as delicious. The Cod was fresh, the individual flakes of the meat coming off discretely, the firmness of the flesh giving it a nice bounce on chewing...definitely a dish not to be missed. The abalone was soft succulent with just the right amount of chewiness. The glutinous rice fried with Chinese sausage dish was remarkable. I must confess that Chinese sausage is not my favourite but the chef managed to make this very tasty and flavoursome. I must remark about the service. It was excellent. in our dinner conversation, my wife remarked that the soup was a little too salty. The waiting staff on hearing this immediately offered to ask the chef to prepare a new bowl. This was promptly done with the same amount of care and tasted just right! On the same note, when they noticed that one of us did not finish eating the pork rib dish (the individual dishes were substantial) they enquired if the food suited our taste and again offered to replace that dish if it was not to our liking. This attention to the patrons indeed marks out this restaurant from the many we have the opportunity to dine in.We had a lovely evening with good friends and will be back in the near future.PS. this restaurant does serve alcoholic drinks including wines & beers but we wanted to enjoy all the flavours of this Chinese meal without distraction! :
5
Had a rough trip in Asia and this meal made everything better. The food and service were impeccable. Every dish was done to perfection. Can't wait to go back!
3
Great Cantonese menu. We booked early for a late sitting and staff were very busy and therefore service very inconsistent. Great environment.
4
We were more limited on times available to dine due to Chinese New Year and unfortunately we were booked in close to closing time for the restaurant and felt a little rushed with our meal. The food was excellent and the price was appropriate for the venu
4
We stopped the day before to make a reservation and when we arrived they couldn't find it. We waited about 10 minutes and then they were able to seat us. Our lunch was tasty and the portions very generous, but appropriate given that this is not an inexpensive restaurant.. We sampled the fried prawns (excellent), a crispy chicken dish, and Singapore noodles. We expected the noodles to be spicier, but they were a bit on the bland side until we requested some chili oil. Some of the dishes on this lunch menu were in honor of Chinese New Year, the Year of the Goat. Service was good, but not outstanding.
5
I've eaten at Shang Palace many times over the years, mostly for lunch. The best sign of its quality is that it's always filled with Chinese patrons; they should know good Chinese food after all. Shang Palace has an extensive menu with all the expected upscale dishes from abalone to bird's nest soup. If you're not into bird nests, there are plenty of other dishes that will keep you happy and untroubled from thinking about how birds make their nests. To many Americans, "Chinese food" means cheap. Well, the Shang Palace is not cheap and, since you generally get what you pay for wherever you are in the world, the food it offers is excellent. My only problem is that I'm tempted to eat much too much when I go to Shang. My lunch becomes dinner too. That's the sign of a good place
5
I was at this restaurant at 9 pm and really hungry after a late meeting. The food were very good. My friend ordered some barbecued pork and duck, I was ordering some vegetable. All food came at an amazing speed. The waitress who served us also was very helpful and friendly. I'll come again to try other foods when I am in Singapore
4
Each and every dish that we ordered was a delight from the whole crispy fish to the Peking duck served in pancakes and then minced in lettuce cups, the clay pot chicken in black bean sauce and the Singapore noodles with a hint of curry. No complaints whatsoever, an enjoyable feast for six.
5
We were entertaining a large group and chose to dine in a private room at the Shang Palace. This proved most worthwhile as we were treated to excellent service and delicious Cantonese fare.The Chef's dim sum menu is well known, but do look at the a la carte menu for the specials. There are seasonal dishes and at Chinese New Year there will be traditional treats too
4
this was our third visit as we go to the Shang palace as whenever we stay at the Shangri-La hotel( which is wonderful)The food is good and well suited to the western palateWe have always found the service attentive but a little distantThe menu is however overly priced 380 Singapore dollars for two and we are not huge eater
3
The location is quite far to walk from Orchard Road but one wants a quiet corner to have a business lunch then the location is very good. Easy to park and possible to get rooms in the restaurant. The menu is very limited. The food is a bit oily. If one wants good food, then there are far better possibilities.
4
was here for a dinner between future in laws
had a private corner
fast service, good food, tasty of course
attentive servers
had some slight issues with the CC after and was resolved in snap
the parking was super convenient as well
5
If you want top class Chinese food, Shang Palace is an excellent choice. The food is great, and the service was attentive.
5
The Shang Palace is always beautiful. It up scale dining in a five star hotel. I dined there last week whilst attending a conference and was suitably impressed. Yum
5
We went to this restaurant for lunch one day and barely succeeded in making a reservation, as the place was literally full.They serve beautiful food here, quite comparable to the food we ate throughout China, at various Shang Palaces at Shangri- La hotels.Great selection of teas and impeccable service.Very good Kung Po chicken, a different receipe, than the classic though, with pine seeds instead of peanuts
3
A nice restaurant in a hotel can be challenging to pull off, and I found the Shang palace to be rather bland. The food was very well presented, although I didn't find it too my personal taste - but nice to try some new things. It was difficult to order wine as the hostess struggled to understand that we wanted two different wines by the glass.Our table, in a 30% occupied restaurant was right by the regularly opening / closing doors of a private dining room, so I had other guests squeezing past me numerous times, no idea why we were sat there. I think this would be far more engaging on a busy evening, but it felt very flat and we felt hurried out of the restuarant at the end of our meal
5
I've been a few times to Shang Palace over the years, I come in for a great meal every time I'm in Singapore.This restraunt is situated on the ground floor of the Shangrila hotel Singapore. The menu is quite vast with a few items out of the ordinary, which I probably will give a miss.I mainly come here for the crispy pork belly which has to rate as one of the best I have ever tasted. The pork skin is very thin and crispy so there is not much fat on it. The Peeking duck is very good and crispy and they offer a second course with it. Value for money on the duck. The wine list is very concise and has wines from France, italy, Spain, USA, Australia just to mention a few. If in Singapore I definitely recommend this one.
3
Staffs are attentive and prompt... I love the do up there as well....But the food is not to my liking.. I've ordered peking duck which i find it so so.. 1 serving of noodles with lobster (it is cook with ginger or onion, couldn't remember). I find the taste of ginger/onion too much for me. 1 serving of wintermelon soup which i find too blend... Think it's just me since most of the review here are good...
4
Over the years Shang has always been consistent. The food is faultless. The service is attentive but not overly. The setting is warm and classy. Always a pleasure. Prices are in line with what you would pay at a Chinese restaurant in a hotel, or maybe slightly more. But I can't say it isn't for nothing
4
Many of the Chinese restaurants in Singapore are too overbearingly too Chinese, local or modernly western with a specific target audience in mind.Shang offers a blend of the all of the above by offering good traditional Chinese( a more Cantonese inclined) dishes in a nice Chinese setting but with a touch of western style service and portion and taste.The Peking duck is good but I preferred majestic restaurant's Peking duck. The other dishes while are good, did not made an outstanding impression on me but I like the way they present their food and the portion provided.They served a good selection of Chinese tea which I think is worth a try even for tourists especially their Pu'er. Good for both, family, business and tourist
5
We have not failed to dine at Shang Palace in each of our visit to Singapore and this was our 4th or 5th visit this year. As always, the ambiance was warm and welcoming from the entrance to our table. Table setting is just right and not too closed to each other. Food for the kitchen of Master chef Steven is excellent and always consistent in quality. We never had a bad meal here. Tee Chai Fong, Assistant Manager added the touch of caring service to make the experience so perfect
5
One of the best Chinese food dine-in experiences I had . The food choices in the menu is excellent and all taste very good. I am so recommending it if you want the best Chinese food in town with excellent venue.
5
This Restauant is within the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore. Excellent food, service was first class and the bill did not need a mortgage!! Well worth a visit for family and friends.
4
We had a lovely meal which met our expectations.
The service was excellent and staff was very attentive.
4
Varieties of Nice dim sum for lunch $ great selection of Chinese dishes with pricey spending of course ;)
5
The food, service and also ambiance are of high standard and consistent. We visit each time we visit Singapore and never disappointed.
5
We had a really great meal at this restaurant with excellent food and service and helped by the staff we were able to have a real Chine food experience. Highly recommended.
5
The food is excellent. We ordered cucumber salad and corn soup both were outstanding. The veg also was really good. The Resturant is inside shangrila hotel near orchard road. Service and food both are top notch.
5
In true Shang Palace fashion, our meal began with this bowl of complimentary starters. I don't know what it is with Shang Palace but everything that comes out from their kitchen is really the best. Take this appetizer for instance, truth to be told, it's a simple tofu snack that's mixed with some chopped up chili. However, it was really one delicious bowl of tofu and we just kept on helping ourselves with it. Yes, it was THAT good. Of course, what's a meal at Shang Palace without having some dimsum, right? We started with an order of Steamed Siew (Sio) Mai ($S5.50). I bit into a piece and notice was it had zero (yes...zero..nada...ziltch) extenders. Instead the siomai was filled with pure ground meat, conpoy and topped with fish roe. This is definitely one siomai my Mom will surely approve of. More here: http://www.frannywanny.com/2013/04/memories-of-home-at-shang-palace-in.htm
5
Visited Shang. Palace again and food is excellent. A lot of veg options. The Resturant is located in shangrila hotel . The corn soup is a must. They have dim sums only for lunch. Also fried rice is really nice. One of my favorite Chinese Resturant in Singapore
5
My family has been frequently going to Shang Palace for dim sum during weekends over the last few years. But we stopped going there after they changed the chef one over years ago because their dishes were no longer of similar standard. For example: the dumpling skin was thick and mushy and the pastry items were dry and not fragrant. Last weekend we decided to return to Shang palace to give it one more try. To our surprise the food is amazing. I am not sure if the chef has changed but the dishes are really delicious. The chili dumpling skin is thin and smooth and the filing is a good mix of meat and prawn. The char siew po lor bun is crispy on the outside and the filing is not too sweet and tasty. The crab meat fried rice has generous portion of chunky crab meat in it. The desert is amazing too. We have avocado cream with ice cream as well as avocado pudding with mango sauce. Both are well presented and taste delicious. We will definitely be back again as this place has a beautiful setup and attentive staff who keep checking on us and never fail to refill our tea cups.
2
Eating in 5 stars is often not a great experience and this place is insipid and boring. Food wasn't that great and the all red ambience made it a bit jarring to the eye.
5
This was the best meal we experienced in all of Singapore!!!! So many delicate flavors. We also had a few people with different dining requests (Halal and vegetarian). Everyone loved this the most!
4
Everything at Shang Palace pleases. The staff if helpful and kind. The food is brilliant. The prices are (gulp) high... but it is worth it.
3
Was horrified to be charged $16 for a small warm water in a plastic bottle.Meals were good but small portions.
5
Good service, good quality within hotel not over priced set menu had lots of choice and the menu was innvetove
5
I usually dine at this restaurant at least once per trip to Singapore. The food is excellent and the service staff are very friendly and eager to give advice to westerners. The tea menu is extensive.
4
An excellent high end Chinese restaurant that does all the basics well and managed to impress a jaded group of Chinese diners with innovative dishes too. Yes, the prices are eye-opening but if you come with the right attitude (i.e. this is a special event, and the point is not to leave being unable to move for being overfull) then you should have an okay time.We noticed the restaurant has many many regulars who are older - always a good sign as older customers imply a long track record of pleasing likely fussier guests with strong views. We found the service to be excellent and attentive and a far cry from the brusque, almost arrogant behaviour we experienced at many other high end Chinese restaurants where the service almost seems to want you to leave with the feeling that you are privileged to be allowed to dine there...Only 4 stars with 10-15% lower prices justifying the fifth...
3
Went here as we stayed in the shangri-la and it looked really nice. Food was great and fresh, service was top notch, the only thing letting it down was the excessive overcharges. A coke poured from a can was $9, food which was already on your table when you get seated gets charged to you without being informed. The meal portions aren't small either even though indicated on the menu.Apart from that was a good dining experience
3
dinner for party of 4. food was good though not exceptionalpricewise , well its ok given that its shangri-lathe experience was marred by the lack of service staff / quality of service. they were shorthanded hence we were left to our own devices for extended periods of time. wait staff for our section actually avoided eye contact as she was uncomfortable taking our order / interacting in english. Unacceptable for any Shang. The service standard at the BKK / JKT Shang Palace is much betteroverall the captain saved the day, she was doing the job of 2 pp

Our family had lunch there. The service was top-notch & the menu was quite extensive. We ordered a variety of dim sum & I'm proud to say, I'd choose Shang Palace over Din Tai Fung anytime. The prices are about the same, but the quality of the food at Shang has way surpassed Din Tai Fung, at least in Singapore.They served this purplish tea that the waitress told me was to 'kai wei', that is, to whet your appetite. I didn't finish it as I found it was too sour for me. We barely began discussing what we wanted to order for the second round before our waitresses came back with our food. & the cycle began- them bringing out all our orders before we could even finish our next order.If you love dim sum, especially those in Hong Kong, don't forget to try this out

Best Cantonese Retaurant in Singapore by far! Top service and restaurant management! The only positive thing in Shangri La

Good food but was too big and too empty. The restaurant lacked atmosphere. Food was served very fast and didn't allow the diner to relax and enjoy the surroundings a little

A great restaurant for dates, family dinners, friends or even work. One room offers so many possibilities from intimate booth style seating, tables and chairs to lovely private rooms. The restaurant was a nice mix of visitors to Singapore and locals. We did have a problem with our on line reservation, not on their bookings but the staff are so efficient, it was solved and we were seated in minutes. Throughout the night the staff were attentive, helpful and approachable without being over bearing. So lets talk about the food. Two menus one for set menus and the other ala carte. The set menus seemed popular with many tables enjoying them, but we opted for choosing ourselves. We had Peking Duck, delicate and crispy, clay hot pot with crab claws, seasonal vegetables and refreshing fruit at the end. Each dish was suburb, mixed with the decor and efficient staff we had a great experience and exceptional meal.

We loved everything about the Shang. From the moment we walked in til the moment we left, everything was superb. Service was second to none without being intrusive. The food was beautifully prepared and served in a timely manner. I am a self confessed Asian foodie and this restaurant is right up there with the best. Pricing is very reasonable but if you want to splurge, they can accommodate the upper end of the market too.I highly recommend the Shang and hope to return

Situated in the Shangri-la, this was a pleasant surprise. We arranged a private room - there were 12 of us - and they arranged the food. Not cheap but the food was outstanding. Great wine list but again not cheap. If you are not on much of a budget Strongly recommended

Ate at the Shang Palace in Shangri La Singapore twice during our week's stay and on both occasions were were very impressed with the quality of the food and service.The staff are warm and friendly. We were helped with our menu choice on our first visit, and we were treated to delicious food. The choices were excellent.On our second visit we had Peking Duck which we pre-ordered and it was magnificent.Yum! We will definitely go back

Dim sum lunch at Shang Palace is best enjoyed at a leisurely pace and that's exactly what we did one lazy afternoon. And we had such a relaxing and enjoyable time that we adjourned to the Lobby Court after lunch.The quality of dim sum was good, with bites of fresh prawns, meat and ingredients inside. Steamed dim sum items were not oily and fried items were crisp without the usual trace of oil pooling beneath them. To soak up whatever oil there was, the fried items were served over a thin slice of egg dough. Most other restaurants would have served them on a paper dolly.Service staff was attentive. As some dim sum items were served in smaller portions and there were 5 of us present, the staff adjusted the serving portions accordingly. That was thoughtful and appreciated.At the end of lunch, we felt comfortable and still had appetite for pastries and coffee at Lobby Court outside

We hosted a dinner for about 10 guests last week. While the service was impeccable, the food was only average. I can probably find the same standard of food for a fraction of the price charged by the Shang. For e.g. the roast chicken meat was tough and dry. The fried rice was not tasty at all and one guest commented that it was not fragrant
5
The menu at Shang Palace is a little daunting as it is so expansive, but all your favourites are there and there are helpful guides to plentiful unique signature dishes to try at very accessible prices. There are plentiful side rooms to have a more private family-style dinner or party event. The service was quietly attentive and spot on. A great meal. Prices are not over the top for international standards making the venue always worth considerin

Had two meals there - dim sum lunch and dinner. There isn't a very large selection of dim sum but what was on offer was fresh and beautifully presented. The dinner menu is very extensive with a range of prices that could have one eating at a reasonable price or really push the boat out. The dishes I had (soup, fish and vegetarian) were all delicious and portions are quite generous. The is a great range of tea and service is very personal - they brought a newspaper for me to read while waiting for the food.

Really excellent chinese food comparing to the chinese food you get in Europe. Every dish was a surprise, refined and very well cooked.
Service was friendly and impeccable. Impressive vine list.
5
I love good Chinese food and the Shang Palace didn't disappoint. Not the cheapest option but the food and service makes it good value.
5
Consistently good and still maintaining standards in spite of fierce competition all round. Opt for set menus as great variety without incurring huge costs.
5
Had excellent dim sum and although it was a last minute thing they gave us a lovely table.
Excellent food, very good service and very good value.
Perfect for a quick lunch.

Food was overall good but price was very expensive. basically Over Priced.

Had one of their set menu's in 2009 and again had one on this visit and ther was no disappointment as the food looked and smelt wonderful

Had gone there for dining with my dad and right from the start the staff made us feel great, offering good suggestions and are very attentive to us. They even noticed small things like bringing water immediately for my dad when he started taking out pre-meal medicine (we already had tea but it's a Chinese custom not to take medicine with tea). We ordered one set each and every dish was prepared with care and just right (both taste and presentation). It was really a delightful experience. Complimentary parking was also provided without asking. And contrary to my initial expectations, price is very comparable to other chain restaurants that were worse off in quality of food and service. I'll definitely be back

Shang Palace has been around many years, but saw a big transformation some years ago. The modern chic, but very oriental design of the restaurant is attractive and they serve lovely chinese food. Junie, who is the general manager of the restaurant, has done well since she took over a few years back, and revamped Shang Palace from its somewhat dated decor and food. Double boiled soups are tasty here and recommended!

Dont bother, find a place outside in town. Hangs off the Shangri-La hotel name but doest come close. Service very clumsy and English poor food was average and price very steep, and yes those pickles and nuts you see on the table and the tea you PAY for! If you have so much money or are too lasy to leave hotel understand otherwise dont bother

We managed to book a table at very short notice and the food was delicious and exquisitvely prepared. Rather than order large main courses we ordered many smaller dishes to taste a diverse range of menu items. The pork ribs literally fell to pieces when served and the crab and prawn fried rice was light and not oily. The staff made a point of accomodating our five year old and supplied ice-cream to her which resembled a bubbling witches' potion. Forget the price, simply go and enjoy the lovely decor and food and order away. The only downside was the staff assumption they got to keep our change from the bill until we pointedly asked for it (they claimed 'we thought you'd already left')- the %10 service change is their tip factored into the bill and the night ended on a sour note. They also charged $5 for the pickles on the table- which we didn't order or eat. My advice is to tell them to take them away if you don't plan to eat them and get it removed from your bill

We had dinner here 3 times and the restaurant went to no end of trouble to cater for our dietary needs - no gluten or dairy - superb food with variety and attentive service.
5
Sweet and sour!!! heavenly Aboid the avocado and semilina dessert on the set menu - not good although some of my fellow diners thought it was OK. service a little slow at lunch 0 order from room service instead.

The set menu, while very good value, was disappointing overall as dishes were very similar.

Quality food and attention to detail. Try it when in Singapore.

For full story, please read: www.epinosh.comReturning umpteen times, Shang Palace or more commonly known as 香宫, has been one of my favourite dining place. The Chinese restaurant resides on the ground floor at The Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore (adjacent to the main lobby lifts), serves authentic Cantonese cuisines with provincial specialties. Chef Steven Ng is at present, the master behind the stove. (after Chef Peter Tsang has left) I picked the most distinguished, one from each featured persona, namely; Croaker Omelet (Race Crab ~ a direct translation if you insist)" or rather 家常赛螃蟹 & Chan Kee favorite Roast Goose or 深井陈记烧鹅 from the nostalgia selections and another 2 dishes from the regular menu. Chan Kee favorite Roast Goose has not been a let down, I am glad. The skin was crisp thin and it taste as good as their popular Peking Duck. The meat was moist and tender but not right to the bones. I'd wish I have requested for a deboned portion as it can be messy when I need to teeth the meat. The meat contained fair amount of fats but not too greasy. The flavour was good enough on its own......Good deals: Shang Palace is having a 1-1 promotion for Childhood Nostalgia now.

We visited the Rose Veranda in the Shangri-La in SIngapore on Boxing Day (26.12.2010) for High Tea.The price for one adult is S$ 68 and for a child it is S$ 48. My son (4 years) ate for free.They had a dient selection on food items at first glance. However, we tried the turkey; it was cold. The potatoes were cold, the baked ham was cold, the gravy was cold. The sushi selection was very limited and looked less than appetizing in a small cabinet. The salmon and tuna sashimi was either empty (not re-filled) or just slapped into the cabinet in a very inattentive way. The rest of the food selection was largely asian ffods which did not look inviting. They served for a S$ 68 buffet fried asian rice noodles which you can eat at any hawker for S$ 2.The dessert section was also disappointing. The bread and butter pudding was Cold! The cake fell apart once you lifted it from the serving tray and the cream in the cake looked and tasted truly artificial. A really bak pastry chef!The one and only decent food were the shrimps and oysters. I ate the shrimp and not the oysters. The service was worse than the food. Not a single waitress ever asked whether we wanted more tea or coffee. One had to stop them to get us tea or coffee.In the beginning they forgot my daughters chamomile tea and they also forgot the apple juice (cheap card board box variety for the price of S$10 per glass). The waitresses had to be reminded to serve us the drinks a few times.A word about the porcelain used. The majority of plates and cups were from a no name brand. Some were from Wedgwood and the tea pots came out in different sizes, shapes and colors. It looked al thrown together without any coordination. Certainly not worthy of a 5 star hotel.All in, I walked out with a S$240 bill for lousy food, hungry and deeply upset about my bad choice for a boxing day afternoon out with the family.Throughout our visit we remained friendly to the staff, hoping they may ask us how everything was. Not a word from them. I filled in the comment card. I hope the responsible F&B Manager starts actually managing his F&B outlets in the hotel

We ate here on our trip to Singapore and the food was great! Granted, we only had one dish, but the dish was excellent.For those of you who are vegetarians, I highly recommend you ask them to make you the mock chicken Kung Pao style. Excellent!Other than that, the staff was always courteous and professional. If they had more variety of vegetarian foods that I enjoy, I would have gone even more often and ordered more than the same dish. They do have a menu for vegetarians, just not the items that I particularly like. So if you are a vegetarian, check it out

This restaurant has been around for a long long time - outliving many of its contemporaries like Tropicana, May Garden, Southron etc.
It is still good especially for dim sum. And you will enjoy the surroundings if you like nostalgia.
