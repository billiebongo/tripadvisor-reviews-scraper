Nice meat cooked from charcoal.. reasonable price.. service is good.. however the table space is a bit cramp.. will be perfect if it is more spacious..
Always make reservation earlier to avoid disappointment..

If you like Korean barbecued food, Don Dae Bak is the place to go. Do make sure to make your reservations early though. Food is great and lip-smacking. I felt though they could improve their service a little better. Otherwise, I had fun.

It is definitely one of my favourite Korean BBQ in Singapore! The staff are attentive and the price is actually not so expensive. The food is delicious.

Don Dae Bak is very nice and has a special flair. It is very difficult to get a table, if you don't have a reservation

I've travelled to over 65 countries and I think this may be my all-time favorite restaurant in the world. It's not perfect, but close to it. It's a small hole-in-the-wall place. A little gritty. Full of charm. It's intimate yet approachable. The value for money is second-to-none, both for the food and beer. And the food... oh man! The meat is out of this world. Nothing here is super premium, and for the price you wouldn't expect it to be, but the quality you receive for what you pay in unreal, especially with the beef (I wouldn't even bother with the chicken or pork, the beef is that good). My wife and I discovered this place accidentally one night, as they were one of the few restaurants open during CNY. It became a regular during our time living in Singapore, visiting at least once a month. We've since moved to Dubai, but Don Dae Bak is the one restaurant we talk about often, almost lovingly, promising ourselves it will be the first we go back to when we eventually return to Singapore

The buffet was $28.50 per person, and only includes raw meat and nothing else, unlike many Korean BBQ places that also offer a spread of cooked food. Meat quality was average, nothing spectacular. However, the service was incredibly slow. It took forever to get our kimchi refilled, and we were not allowed any refill of meats until we finished everything on our table. This resulted in long stretches of time where the BBQ plate was actually empty. In addition, the coals did not retain heat for long so we had to change the coals twice during our entire meal. We were only allowed 1.5h to eat, and this made us feel really rushed. Coupled with the slow service, we actually did not get to eat much at all, so the $28.50 price was not worth it. Would I come here again? Definitely not. There are many Korean BBQs out there that are much more worth it, and with better service

Ate the buffet, paid about 26++ dollars each.Charcoal grilled BBQ meat.One of the nicest I have eaten so far. Juicy and tasty! Will need a good hair and body wash after dinner though, cos the whole body stinks!I think the nearest MRT station is Outram Park though (instead of those listed here)

Whenever I feel the urge to eat Korean, this is the only place that comes to mind. The food is delicious, the staff very helpful and the prices are fair for the amount of food they serve you in the buffet (as in the Korean meat servings).Love i

Read the review and decided to give this restaurant a try despite all the bad review on service.Surprisely the service was good and we really enjoyed the buffet korean bbq. Made a reservation and when we reached, tabld was already ready and set up. Place was packed and of course we walked out all smelling of bbq but who cares. Loved the beef and pork loin. We ordered a soju that went so well with the meat. Service was prompt and efficient so contradicting to the reviews I had read. Overall enjoyable dinner

To date, I've been here 3 times in the span of less than a year. Authentic cosy Korean joint serving ala-carte (I've not tried) and BBQ buffet for lunch and dinner. All times I had the dinner BBQ buffet which costs only about SGD$25/pax tax and gst-inclusive, which is really cheap. Meats were fresh, tender and delicious with my favourite being the marinated chicken! Free-flow side dishes are also served, along with lettuce, garlic, chili, pepper and refillable egg on grill. For the quality of of the food and good service, I would give this place a huge thumbs up. One of my favourite Korean joints definitel
