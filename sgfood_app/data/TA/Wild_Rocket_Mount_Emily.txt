Food was interesting and tasty. Asian spices and classic flavors incorporated well into western cooking techniques.
On the whole also not that pricey.
5
We came here for dinner and were truly floored. Delicious flavors, good drinks and good representation of mod-sing cuisine. They were extremely accommodating and hospitable. A must go to while in Singapore!
5
I went here with two colleagues. The chef was quite willing to put together a 5-course vegetarian menu for me with prior notice. The food was excellent. Each course was small with good flavors. Some courses had subtle tastes. Others were bold and spicy. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The wine list was good. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the atmosphere is quiet.

Feb 12th we had a fabulous meal at Wild Rocket..the flavors were wildly enticing, and each tasting menu course built on the next with waves of various foods, whisps of spice, hints of exotic delicate flavors. We even had them pair wines with each dish, and the results were fantastic. All the servers (especially Ram) were very knowledgeable and could explain each dish in detail. Chef Low even took time out from the kitchen to say Thank you. A memorable experience
5
I always wantewtl try Wild Rocket and I finally did. The food is one of the best food I have ever eaten. The flavors are so familiar yet it's elevated to a point that it's mind blowing. I would recommend anyone to eat at this restaurant and I would be back to try the omakase menu.

Very easy to find, in a great little neighbourhood just out of the hustle and bustle of the city. Setting is very crisp, minimalistic and clean. Waiting staff were unassuming, extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the cuisine. Table settings and cutlery drawer were cool.Food - amazing. I am sure dishes will change so won't review specifics but what came out of our experience is the obvious skill and passion in creating the dishes as the flavours, contrasts, and textures are so well done. Crisp and distinct flavours come through in layers that don't clash and complement each other so well. Each mouthful was exciting.Priced very well especially for the complexity you are getting in the meals. The table service was excellent and the drinks (basic cocktails) were mixed expertly to the point that they were the best balanced and flavoured cocktails we had ever had.We were impressed and left very happy indee

We've decided to try this place for a set lunch menu. The location is quite far from the major streets but to be honest I enjoyed the place that was very quiet and with a green surrounding area. The strange thing of this restaurant is that it is at the ground floor of a building that I didn't understand if it was a condominium or a hotel. However, the atmosphere was nice and the staff very professional. I had a smoked duck salad that was really good but they could have put more duck to be honest as there was just the smell of it. But I can forgive this as the cannelloni with the duck ragout and truffles were amazing, one of the best cannelloni I've ever tried in my life. I also had a coconut dessert that was good too. I hope to come back soon in this place.

We came here purely because of what seemed like a great value lunch menu. Otherwise I would have never considered coming here. Now that I have, it'll be hard to stay away.We started with Soto Ayam soup and a Smoked Duck salad. Both were great. The soup was so intense!For mains we had a Salted Fish spaghetti, which I was curious about. I wondered how it worked, but my gosh it does and it's fantastic! I didn't really like the whole peppercorns in there, as when you got one, it would overpower the rest of the dish. I left them to the side. The other main was an Adobo Duck ragout cannelloni with mushroom and truffle infusion. Wow this smelt amazing, and it tasted even better. I had no words. I actually went to Gaig a few days later and tried their famed truffle cannelloni as well, and it wasn't even close to how good Wild Rocket's version is!For dessert I had an almond brittle, peanut butter icecream and dark chocolate fudge. It was great. Overall, I can't believe you can get this quality for $32! Everytime I am in Singapore, I will definitely make this one of my first choices! Well done

A nice place with group of friends. Tasting portions are always a pleasant surprise to the palate. The fusion in taste is interesting. Love it when chef has a passion for his work. Service is good. Great ambience. There is no recommended dish as it depends on what the chef is cooking for you.
5
Thus place is an experience from the location which is pretty hard to find , to the menu which is short and very unique. As we were a group of 20 + we pretty much had everything on the menu and everyone was excited about the food. Pomelo and prawns salad was amazing and pretty hard to describe as it had so many ingredients. Definitely worth trying. The restaurant has a long list of drinks. While the location is hard to find it was definitely packed when we got there; probably wise to make a reservation. Strongly recommend
4
Hidden away gem, food is an interesting and delicious take on Singapore flavours. Totally recommend it. Look for the hidden cutlery drawers.
5
Great food. The presentation and taste of food are excellent. Chef's interpretation of local dishes is just great. My guests all love the food and service here.
4
The decor was edgy rather than fine dining. Customers could come in bermudas and T shirts.The service was friendly. They explained each dish on serving.The focaccia was too dry!The soto ayam was average.The pomelo salad was great, an example of the whole greater than its parts.The spanner crab ravioli in laksa broth neglected the laksa broth; not thick and fragrant enough.The tiger prawn spaghettini looked good but tasted average. The Japanese seaweed sauce did not quite make it.The chendol was great but the brownie dessert was too deconstructed, an example of parts not coming together as one
4
Although we had some difficulties to find the actual restaurant (it's inside a hostel) we are really glad we went all the way from Orchard Road to Mount Emily for this restaurant. The atmosphere is fabulous, cosy and trendy. The food is Asian and also trendy. The service was good, but maybe a little too quick. It's rather pricey and we felt like there was not enough time to enjoy the delicous and amazing food. So maybe ask them to slow down a bit between the courses?!
5
Pomello Prawn salad was absolutely sensational - one of my most memorable flavour dishes in Singapore to date - new flavours and so refreshing for hot singapore. I would have happily eaten another portion! Home made pasta cannelloni with the duck was delicious. It is in an unusual location - at the back of a posh/high end youth hostel, however it is near a park, hidden and tucked away which made for a really peaceful vibe. Great service too - attentive and friendly. Definitely would recommend and return again â€¦ soon
4
This lovely little restaurant hides its light under a bushel. There isn't an obvious sign on the street at the end of Upper Wilkie Road to say it is there, and you have to guess it is in the ground floor of the hostel at 10A. But once you find it, you are encased in a modern wooden cavern, which reminded me of a giant wine rack and my companion of piles of wooden chairs. The menu ranges across Singaporean, Indian and Japanese, and all imaginative, tasty and well prepared, although my duck cannelloni was rather dry and tough to my taste. The pork main is excellent, as are the desserts.Certainly a place worth a try.
5
These guys served one of the best food in Singapore. If you are looking for Mod S'pore or fusion food because you just cant eat anymore chinese this is the place. About $50usd for a fabulous 4 course meal that included barramundi carpaccio with orange shallot dressing & dashi jelly, spanner crab & daun kesom ravioli in laksa broth, and iberico pork char siew wi th shanghai kao cai & quinoa the chef owner is quite amiable and the service excellent. It ranks up there with the other top end places but not the price is much better
5
My wife and I visited Wild Rocket for a birthday celebration and enjoyed our time there.I would recommend a counter seat over the dinning table as it had more interaction with the chef himself and the bartender.We had the Omakase menu; the theme of the food is classic Singaporean food remade into modern degustation format. These claissic dishes of prawn noodle, laksa, chilli crab, fried carrot cakes, and pandan cakes were transformed into different shape and form. It's refreshing in a way of giving diners the pleasant surprises by conflicting senses (taste/smell v sight). We also tasted different sake, which they have a nice inventory, through their recommendation through the evening.The restaurant is cozy and the place is tucked in a secluded location. Service was personal and attentive, leading from the owner chef himself, Willin.It's a pleasant evening
5
Came here to entertain 5 biz colleagues from out of town and they all left very impressed. VERY inventive menu, each course being a mix of cleverly complementing flavours, colours and textures. Half of us had variations of the tasting menu, to maximise the spread of tastes, and none were disappointed. Two of the party were vegetarian and one requested gluten free - not a problem for Willin Low, the Chef / Owner, who had obviously planned these when designing the menu, not as after thought as in some restaurants, and who made time to come out to chat with all the guests during the meal. The staff were professional, knowledgeable and super courteous and attentive, without ever being intrusive. The wine list wasn't cheap (but then it never is in Singapore!) and I was bit lost with all the Sakes, but the final price was very reasonable for the superb meal we'd had.It's a pleasantly small, intimate location that can be a tad difficult to find - but it was well worth the effort. A great find
5
Chef and owner Willin Low was super hospitable and friendly. He takes a lot of pride in his creations, using local flavors deconstructing them and putting them together in a new way. He created Mod-Sin, modern Singaporean food. The highlights of my meal were the assam laksa salad and the Iberico Pok Char Siew. The Pork was superbly flavored and tender. I would recommend the moderately priced tasting menu. The decor is well appointed, wonderfully designed but not overdone
4
Had the 4 course menu. The food can be described as Singaporean fusion with the West. They have paired the flavours well. Enjoyed the laksa ravioli and cheese cake to end.
Small intimate restaurant at the previous Mt Emily Hotel.
1
Have heard much about this place but never had lunch there before. Went once for a private party some years back and like the place. Check on line and thought the price of the lunch menu was pretty reasonable. There is a 2 and 3 course lunch set. However, it was not stated that you can't order anything else! No ala-carte choice. One of our companion was not too hungry and requested for a soup but were just told there isn't and staff did not want to make any exception, even when they knew she then did not order any meal.The food was a great disappointment. The appetiser we order, aka sashimi was too salty. The main courses are all pasta but tasted really bad. Trying to be fusion but really cannot make it. And one of us felt there is too much MSG because she is very sensitive to it. All of us are there first time for lunch and we all agreed this place will be banned
5
My wife and I visited this restaurant on the 13th March 2017 for dinner. Initially the taxi driver had difficulty finding the restaurant as it is not immediately obvious but it is well worth persisting as the food is excellent. Our 3 course dinner including a bottle of Suavignon Blanc cost Singapore $267 and was well worth the experience. The service is also excellent and the chef was good enough to come out and have a chat with us at the end of the meal. It transpires he trained as a lawyer but decided to change career to practice his passion of cooking and it shows in the delicious food presented. The strawberry cheesecake is 'to die for'
5
Went for lunch to try the new pasta menu. Had the oxtail rendang pasta - quite unusual but worked well. Finished off with coconut ice cream, delicious! Planning a return visit for dinner to try more of the new menu. Well worth the hike up Mt Emily..
4
Wild Rocket is the flag bearer of Singaporeâ€™s ModSin cuisine (which is a modern take on traditional Singaporean meals). Imagine having nasi lemak, char kueh teow but twisted and fusion into something completely unexpected. The decor has a large infusion of wood which makes the place really warm and cozy. Really nice for lunch, albeit a bit out of the way from the city center
4
Lovely little place with fusion pasta, I had duck curry futtucine that was amazing, the beef tongue one less so. LImited menu and small seating area but lovely and intimate and the chef clearly tries very hard to come up with original ideas. Love the idea of him serving sake but not sure it works....Worth tryin
4
Tucked in the back of the first level of a budget hotel (but independently operated) at the top of Mt. Emily, this is a place to go if you are a lover of fusion food that is really done to perfection. The dishes are all Singapore cuisine themed, as their website explains. My companion and I each ordered that evening's 5 course dinner special, and shared all the dishes to get a complete sampling of the food. Portions are not huge, but don't need to be, plenty of food for the two of us. And some really tasty dishes. We happened to visit on an evening that the owner/chef was away (we were told), but the food was still all well done and attractively presented....a wonderful pasta dish, char siew pork, and seabass were some of the hits, though all the food was interesting (including the desserts!). We've all been, probably, to fusion style restaurants that just seem to throw unrelated food together with less than successful results. Not here, the Singaporean street food theme was present in all the dishes. Cozy and comfortable setting, its a small place (so perhaps call ahead), but the low ceilings keep the noise levels from the other diners at a manageable din, and the wood carvings on the walls and ceiling (there's a name for this I can't recall at the moment) most attractive. As with so many restaurants these days, bare-topped tables, but at this place, it works perfectly as its not trying to be an elegant, five-star affair......its a stylish, cozy, trendy place, really good Singaporean fusion food, great service, prices perhaps on the upper edge. For "Fusion foodies", Wild Rocket should definitely be on your list!! Recommended

My all means go. Beautiful place, Swift service, excellent food. Wine list has essentials. Food is artful and tasty. Prefix was S$75 and left me impressed. But certainly not too full. BTW, your knife and fork are in the drawer under your table. Fun surprise. BTW2. Yes it is in that hotel lobby area. Keep looking.

I was visiting Singapore in December and a friend invited me to dinner at this restaurant. It is situated in a quiet neighbourhood, not far from the top end of Orchard Road. The restaurant is not the easiest place to find, but the food is worth the time you spend looking for it. The restaurant is in a modern house and quite low key. The restaurant is at the back of the house (hotel). Not a massive restaurant, so probably worth booking ahead. The food is modern Asian, and we went for their tasting menu, four courses, each course was absolutely perfect, not particularly large (some may say small) but full of flavours that kept your mouth tingling from the pleasant tastes that kept going even after you had swallowed the food. The presentation on the plate was part of the art of the experience.I would strongly recommend visiting the restaurant for a easy social setting, a romantic dinner. This is not a restaurant to go to if you are looking for a pile the plate high with food

I have been gourging on hawker food in Penang and by the time I got to Singapore I had my fill. Wild Rocket was perfect as it was still Singaporean, not Western or Japanese (what's with Singapore's obsession with Japanese?). I was in Singapore after all and what shame if i had gone to a Japanese! Wild Rocket uses local ingredients and hawker concepts to come up with their cleaver creations. I was super surprised the Chandol desert tasted amazingly like chandol but it was not.
5
My wife and I where wanting to try traditional Singaporean cuisine and this is what we got 3 course set lunch was great value for money, food was amazing and staff extremely friendly. Not the easiest place to get to by MRT but shouldn't put you off going
4
Lovely interior, friendly staff and delicious food.We totally enjoyed everything we ordered.Tastes and textures are on point there's really nothing to improve on.Nothing disappoints.We ordered 2 sets of 4 course menu which offers great value.A cup of chamomile tea after the dessert is the perfect closing
4
With only a handful of tables, Wild Rocket provides a fun sense of exclusivity - all the tables were full on the Monday night we dined there. My wife is gluten free, and they made her a pomelo salad and a nice noodle & kale dish packed with flavor. The 48 hour spare ribs were delicious.The best part of the meal was a dessert brought for my wife's birthday that wasn't on the menu but should have been - a pandan leaf panna cotta with coconut sugar. It was phenomenal - the best panna cotta I've had in my life. And contrary to other reviews we've seen, service was solid.There was a great drink selection as well. It was our first night in Singapore, so we weren't in full groove yet to attempt the omikase menu, but we'd definitely recommend it. Order that panna cotta if you can
3
As per subject line, they have amazing starters and dessert. The thai-influenced starter which contained pomegranate and nuts was so amazing! Their desserts too...However, I find their main very boring, both the menu and the flavor. We ordered beef and spaghettini. Beef was mediocre and spaghettini was totally dry and flavorless. Expected so much more for the price tag and supposedly Singapore's top chef.Unlikely to revisit
4
Great introduction to modern Singaporean dishes. Had the 3-course lunch and the food was good. Everything was very flavourful and unique. The only downside is that the portion is quite small, hence lunch was not as filling as it should be. Perhaps lunch could be increased to a 5-course meal considering the sizes of the dish
5
I had dinner here and thoroughly enjoyed it. The flavours were amazing - I had a very interesting soup to start, red snapper in a Cambodian curry and finally a pannacotta-based dessert. Every dish was amazing. I also really liked that the portions were just the right size - enough to make you satisfied but not so much that there is no room for dessert. Throughout the evening, the service was really charming, warm and professional. A totally enjoyable evening and well worth the money - I loved it, and will definitely be back next time I'm in Singapore.
4
We tried the omasake, while the children had either the set or ordered from the ala carte menu. Food was an interesting interpretation of local dishes - for example char kway teow with squid slices in replacement of the flat noodle. Dish was tasty, almost like the real thing except for a slight difference in texture.Service was good. Crew explained every dish that was brought out. Even shared that they carried the sake which Abe-san presented to Obama and is now sold out everywhere. They even shared they had a sister of that sake (cheaper) which they actually preferred and we ordered that instead. Was a good choice, paired well with the dishes
3
Visited Wild Rocket with friends and family for a special occasion dinner. The restaurant is located in a good location but the signage is poor so it took us a little time to find it. All but one of our party opted for the 4 course menu which we enjoyed very much. The portions were a good size and the food delicious, although we wouldn't describe it as Modern Singaporean, more western-asian fusion. The main disappointment was that one member of our party chose to have only a main of snapper which she enjoyed, however when it arrived it did not come with a side dish and when we asked if we could get a bowl of rice to accompany it or indeed any other side to bulk it out a bit we were told this was not possible. This to us was very strange and tainted our experience. We forgot to specifiy tap water and were brought bottled water, the waiter taking it upon himself to open new bottles when one was finished (which we aknowledge is quite common in restaurants) - we quickly asked for tap water when he opended the second bottle but were still charged: the water was extortionate! We paid 20 dollars for 2 bottles of water which I think is utterly ridiculous and this has really affected our opinion of the restaurant. A few tweaks to the service and pricing would greatly improve this restaurant
3
We tried Wild Rocket for a special occasion lunch with friends, where the whole of our table opted for the 3-course set lunch. At SGD35, it was good value though there was the option of certain Main Courses which could be offered as part of the set lunch at a supplementary cost. Though the menu was quite small, there were a range of interesting dishes which were overall tasty and with an interesting twist. Some of our party felt that the portions for the set lunch were a little small, however I felt that they were sufficient for lunch. The only let-down from the meal was the dessert - the options for the set lunch were somewhat lacklustre and uninspired. We didn't have anything bad, but nothing particularly 'wow'-ed us with the choices (champagne jelly with sorbet, or coconut ice-cream with Gula Melaka). All in all, a good meal that's worth checking out
5
Really enjoyed most of our meal, flavours were good, spicy and really tasty. There's not a crazily large choice of food or drink, but it's all good, so that works quite well. Only slight downside is that the food came so fast we were done in an hour! I would highly recommend to anyone who is interested in simple food cooked really well
5
Wonderful meal as a special occasion. Would recommend the 4 course option, promise it isn't too much food. Crab pasta particularly wonderful and delicious lychee martinis. Only downside - all courses served quite quickly so felt a bit rushed through.
4
Wild Rocket is a nice restaurant that specialises in ModSing cuisine. The dishes we ordered were mixed mushroom dash consommé with shiitake wonton, salmon red rice & baby octopus donburi, adobo duck with onsen quail egg, truffle mash & baby spinach, spanner chili crab linguini with onsen egg, 48-hr beef short rib with smoked oyster milk & kale crisp, roasted stuffed quail with yun cheong sausage & jus, peanut butter ice cream and black sesame ice cream. Our favourite among all the dishes were the salmon & baby octopus donburi, chili crab linguini, stuffed quail and both the peanut butter and black sesame ice creams. I didn't like the mushroom consommé, it was bland and one dimensional in taste. The short-rib was very dry even though is was cooked sous vide, adobo duck was ok but not really great. Service was exceptional. Worth a visit when in Singapore
3
it is my second visit in one month as I felt comfortable the first time but the impression was the same. Food is nice but not "special". you expect something better in a place like this. soft shell crab was nice but the quail was overcooked. dessert ok but lava cake and raspberry sorbet are a strange couple. I felt I paid more than they deserved. I dont think i will be back
5
Nice location outside of the core CBD/orchard areas and therefore easy to drive to. The fixed four course menu for dinner was perfect, each dish had a unique taste and was just the right size. Staff are friendly and well informed about the menu. Don't drink , but the wine list looked to be good quality. Will certainly be back. Expensive and worth every dollar :)
5
My husband and I visited Wild Rocket on our honeymoon travels. We opted for the tasting menu and it was delicious! We'd been to several fine dining restaurants during our time in Singapore, but Wild Rocket was way more up our alley. I loved the lychee martini and, while every dish was great, the fish dishes really stood out to me. The chef even came out and described several of the dishes to us. When we make it back to Singapore, we will definitely be making a stop at Wild Rocket
4
It was my first time to the restaurant Wild Rocket for a birthday celebration and was wowed by the fusion meal. We opted the 4 dishes set meal so as to try most of the dishes on the menu as far as possible. I was very impressed with the asian fusion of some of the dishes like the laksa pesto linguine with king prawns and the Chilli Crab spaghettini with egg. It was out of this world. I would recommend people to come try their creation. Thanks to the Chef for coming out with these dishes
4
My friends and I ordered 4-course set meals for dinner and we enjoyed the food. The restaurant is small but cozy and comfortable. The portions are generally small but the quality of food is very good. We liked the short rib as the meat is tender and flavourful. The entrée and pasta are also very tasty, and ingredients used are fresh and dishes are prepared in a way that brings out the freshness!
4
This was a business lunch and we all opted for the set menu. The soft shell crab is good, although not overwhelmingly so, and the prawn with spaghetti main course was tasty and not too large. Dessert was a coconut ice cream with maple syrup. Service was attentive, and the meal was served quickly, which was perfect for us as we were on a short timeline. I felt this was somewhat pricey for the menu ($35/head for 3 small courses), but overall no complaints
5
We went for a function at Wild Rocket one evening and had set dinner. The mean was excellent - we had scallops, papaya salad (Fantastic), risotto, as well as other dishes. Service was attentive. The portions weren't large but very tasty with good wine pairings. I will be back.
4
The menu is relatively, as there aren't that many to choose for, we basically tried 2/3 option in each stage of the meal. Appetizers: Pomegranate Salad, Salmon and Baby Octopus with RicePasta: Laksa Pesto, Spicy Crab Spaghetti and Seafood LinguiniMain: Iberico Ham and Short RibsDessert: Strawberry Cheesecake and Pandan Pana CotaI am just simplifying the menu, with the most basic description. The thing that I felt, basically was that there are some very nice meals like the Laksa Pesto and the Ribs. I wouldn't really say that the flavour or the taste of the restaurant is purely Singaporean, as there are many parts of Asia or even western influence on the dishes that are served in this restaurant. I enjoyed my dinner, but for some reason I didn't quite fully feel satisfied, there is a feel that is missing from me to say that this was an excellent meal. It was good but it wasn't great.I took quick photo of the meal, if you would like to see
5
Take my word for it...just book a table and try it out for yourselves! Me and my wife went whilst visiting Singapore and we agree that the food is some of the best we've ever had. We like our fine dining and have travelled a number of countries trying some great restaurants, but Wild Rocket was a unique and more casual experience. The restaurant itself is under a hotel on Mount Emily, you won't stumble upon it, you'll need to have planned the visit. The decor is modern and light with a casual and friendly atmosphere and setting. The staff were delightful and very knowledgeable about the menus on offer. We opted for the 4 course menu and each picked different dishes so that we could enjoy as much of the menu as possible. The salad came with a frozen dressing that you melt and mix in and wow was it worth it. The taste and attention to detail in every dish was an experience and if we were staying in Singapore for longer we would certainly have gone back. Dinner for two with several glasses of wine was around s$300 so very reasonable for the quality. A must try if you like your food and are staying in Singapore.
5
Was quite a fan of Willcookwilleat on Instagram, hence decided to pay a visit to this restaurant. Was a little skeptical when I saw the menu online and nothing strikes me as must-have immediately. I am not a huge fan of fusion food too. Was pleasantly surprised that the food turned out to be really good! Had the Pomelo salad starter & it was very refreshing. Laksa pesto pasta was the highlight for me. Flavorful, pasta done well & it's just an excellent creation - could never have imagine that two strong flavors could blend and taste so well! This is a MUST-TRY!Had the lava cake & strawberry cheesecake for desserts. Both are nice. The location was a little inaccessible, service was alright. Definitely going back for the laksa pesto pasta!
4
We had a variety of a la carte dishes with 5 people and booked a few weeks in advance. Except for the bar it was full house on a Saturday.Some dishes were compelling: pomelo, prawn and coconut starter, deconstructed strawberry cheesecake dessert, laksa pesto linguini. Chef Low shows he understands flavors and textures here. Others were underwhelming: seafood crustacean oil spaghettini, beef short rib. A pasta of $35 should not be incredibly dry. These need a few more iterations before they are great dishes. Serving size for pasta's and main are a little small, but are just nice for starters and desserts.Service was attentive, warm and careful we had an infant with us. Patient during our order with questions and able to accommodate. Could keep a better eye on topping up water.Rich selection of sake's. The wine list is okay, not fantastic (all stocked half-bottles are merlot blend, so much for options), and prices are a tad high even for Singapore. Could use a few better beers in stock as there were only Tiger and 1 Hitachino when we visited
5
This is my best dining experience in Singapore so far ! We all took the 4 courses menu at 75$. Even if it is 4 courses, you don't overeat as portions are very moderate. Everything in the plate is beautiful to look at, and then, when you eat, so many flavours, tastes, come out and it's simply divine. Very delicate, subtle, balanced. There is a good wine list as well as a sake list. You get very good advices on wines to best match your dishes. Service was excellent, very professional. And finally, the place, which is almost hidden in an hotel, at Mount Emily, is beautifully arranged, with nice wood furnitures. Very good atmosphere. I will definitely go back there
5
This restaurant must be one of the best kept secrets in Singapore. The food is simply exceptional & even on our 2nd visit we found it absolutely stunning. I have no wish to bore anyone by going through thw whole 'Omakase' menu dish by dish but suffice it to say that whether your palate prefers seafood, meat or puddings you will not be disappointed. I think only 1 or at most 2 of the 9 courses were repeated from the first time we came 4 months before & these were worthwhile repeating!We would describe the cooking as 'Modern Singaporean Fusion' with a fine dining take on several traditional Singapore street food dishes.Best served with their own selection of different Sake's, even including a kind of 'pudding' sake which is both most unusual & a delicious accompaniment to their wonderful desserts.Not cheap (expect >Â£100 per head with sake or wine) but well worth it for a true modern gourmet splash out! We will not hesitate to go again next time we're passing through Singapore
5
Interestingly designed space in the Hangout Hotel on Mount Emily. The food amalgamates local influences and ingredients with western techniques. Stand out dishes were the pomelo salad with frozen coconut dressing, beef carpaccio with sesame and ginger puree & linguine with laksa pesto. Wine mark ups slightly exorbitant, but hey, it's Singapore
4
This place has been around about 10 years and my 2nd time here. Just managed to debut on the Asia best restaurants list alsoWas renovated 1-2 years ago and the tables seemed closer together. A sushi counter was built for the omakase dinnerWe opted for the 4 course dinner. The wine list is short and kind of blah. My first course of pomelo salad had an instantly local flavour. The 2nd course of spaghettini is similar to the one at Ember . Main course of beef was alright. Dessert was deconstructed cheesecakeOverall very good, but many other restaurants to fight for mindshare her
4
I visited Wild Rocket with around twenty of my work colleagues for a team dinner. By and large, most of the group were impressed - and so was I. However, I felt it just missed a special something that restaurants of this sort need to get the top rating.We ate from the four course menu. I chose beef carpaccio, basil minced pork, pork char sui and cheesecake. The food was consistently good. Each of my dishes was creative, well balanced and very tasty. In fact, I'd struggle to rank them in any particular order of preference - and to some extend, that highlights where Wild Rocket just falls short. There was no single standout dish that I would insist somebody must try. If I went again, I'd probably choose four different dishes. All very good, but none that left you begging for more.Wild Rocket has a lot of other things going for it. Located slightly out of the way, there is an element of escape about its setting. Oddly, it is attached to a hotel that has a very different class/style, but the restaurant itself has a nice ambience. The set up is simple but the quite perculiar wooden barbs coming from the ceiling add an element of intruige.Service was very good. Both leading up to the booking as I changed the headcount and on the night itself, I found them helpful and friendly throughout. One of the best compliments you can give service is to say you got everything you needed but didn't really notice they were there, and I would say that applies here.Overall, a very nice place and I'd recommend a visit. I have no real criticism, I just didn't quite find a 'wow factor' in otherwise very good food. Perhaps somebody else will
5
Maybe a bit difficult to find but just worst for it. Amazing welcome. Staff trained, knowledged and worm... Let's talk about the food tasty tasty and tasty. We went for the chef menu. And was incredible. Don t need to talk about just go. In the wine list take the riesling from Egon muller best of the best. We took 2 bottles and match with all menus. Thank you for the team and see you next month. Egon muller fan....

Basically smack in the middle of Singapore's centre the place is 'off the beaten track' on top of a hill (Mount Emily) next to a small park inside a budget style hotel, but don't be fooled by the latter.The place is small and 'smart casual'. The menu too is limited but varied with 4 starters and 3 pastas, mains and deserts and the option of a 4-course where you select 1 of all (it's worth it) and consists of fusion Western-Asian dishes. I'm no Gordon Ramsay but having taken the 4-course I'm going to give it my best shot:Starter - Beef carpaccio with sesame ginger puree: The first bite the sesame seemed a bit overwhelming but the ginger slowly infused and after a few bites the combo worked very well.Pasta - Krapao thai basil minced pork bee tai mak with onsen egg: Presented very nicely you have to mix-up the ingredients on your plate to have a smooth, mildly spicy dish that combines very well. The chily is enough for a little kick but does not overpower the flavour of the pork.Main - Baked halibut with buah keluak pesto & roasted vegetables: A good portion and nice but probably the most disappointing, found the pesto a little bland but the fish was cooked pretty much perfectly.Desert - Pineapple dark chocolate tart: Awesome. The pineapple is served as a sherbet on a chocolate pastry tartlet with a chocolate filling and small pieces of cut citrus. Excellent combination with rich and well combining flavours. I topped it with an espresso which combined great too.Also tried the house wines and had a glass of Marborough Souvignon Blanc which was fresh and tart and a glass of Italian Pinot Noir which was the lesser choice being a little 'flat' in taste.All in all worth it despite the slightly high price

We had a tasty business lunch at Wild Rocket. Great to enjoy local dishes with a sophisticated touch. Don't forget to complement your meal with one of their nice wines.
5
Had a relaxed, informal and superb meal at Wild Rocket. Salad with frozen dressing and halibut for main was excellent. Great service too, really impressed with this restaurant which is off the beaten path but a terrific find.
3
The food is ok here. not much to rave about but you can get your fill. At night its a great place to hang out and have a few drinks
4
Innovative and well done. Quiet with good food and peaceful decor. The salad starter with the frozen coconut dressing is tremendous
3
Recently went to Wild Rocket on recommendation and whilst there is nothing wrong with it I just didn't feel that impressed. Food is good but doesn't have the Wow factor and is quite expensive for what it is.
5
Had a wonderful team dinner in a private room. The tasting menu was diverse, great flavors and a truly "fusion" experience of French and Asian. The Sushi/Crudi of scallops with truffle was amazing. Each course built on the prior one and created increased expectations which continued to be met. Wine choices and dessert were great additions. we were a group of 15 and the quality and elegance were amazing and as such I plan to return and highly recommend. One of the best places for me in Singapore.

The Wild Rocket is certainly one of the top restaurants in Singapore. However, our last experience was average. The usual problem is a too cold AC, but knowing it we dress accordingly. The new menu was quite tasty, but we weren't satisfied with the main courses. The short ribs were served cold and the halibut was just a mini portion. In a restaurant like Wild Rocket one would expect pre-heated plates. Service was however the bigger issue. To be served in such (30 seater) restaurants from all 4 waiters is annoying. We probably would have had another glass of red wine if one would have asked us. No this time service wasn't good at all and food just okay but not whow as usual. Consistency is the challenge in this business.

Went there for dinner with friends and expected food that would be innovative and out of this world. Sorely disappointed. Had the pomelo salad with king prawns. Firstly that's not a aking prawn. Its an average shrimp. Secondly ordered chilli crab linguni. Very average. Heavy on the tomato sauce and the flavor felt more sweeter than spicy. Not returning
5
I tried the tasting menu and was surprised by the dishes one after one. Just very tasty, with lots of nice fusion of food and taste, which are the great successful experiments by the chef. The host who invited me to Wild Rocket reckoned that they need to go there more often now before it gets any michelin star. I agree, but I'll certainly go again even when Wild Rocket becomes that famous
5
Guess, we are creating a tradition: Again we spent upon arriving in from Europe in the evening, our Christmas Dinner at the Wild Rocket @Mount Emily.The food is so savory & fantastic, we always choose the Wild Rocket Menu; for us a great first evening to kick-off our Asia holiday adventures. The Wild Rocket crew was very attentive, professional and very nice.Even though the restaurant has only a couple of tables and a bar with some folks, we had enough privacy and felt like home. Why you should go there: - If you love puristic design (Wild Rocket is held in Japanese chashitsu) the tables had drawers on each side with cutlery in it- If having a view overlooking Singapore from the restaurant is not important to you - If you love Mod Sin food - If you love walking back through the quietness into buzzing Singapore (we enjoyed this walk a lot)Love going there for our next Christmas Dinner
5
I was invited to this restaurant for the first time and all guests and myself were all impressed by the dishes from the tasting menu. I would not be surprised if this restaurant is to be given michelin star in near future.
5
very clean and nice ambience. served local dishes and continental breakfast for large groups. every one praised their standard of food and quality
5
Unusual location in budget hotel/hostel. Fantastic food and unique approach with silverware in small drawers at table, as an example. Lovely atmosphere, wonderful food, fantastic staff. Excellent value for "top chef" menu inventiveness and quality.
5
Very simple and beatiful restaurant with friendly staff. Chef Willin came out to meet all the guests and chat. Food is "Mod Sin" modern Singaporean and delicious. Loved the silverware drawer built into the table.
3
I am going to go against the trend of recent reviews for Wild Rocket. Yes the food is good and the chef has been quite clever in making Singaporean food contemporary. We chose the a la carte menu and I just feel that it is over priced in comparison to other eating establishments in Singapore. Perhaps we will try the Omakase menu next time and find there is better value? The restaurant is stunning with a Scandinavian ambience with very comfortable seating
5
We went as a group of 5 foodies which meant that we managed to try all the dishes on the 3 course and 4 course menus plus a couple of extra. Kudos to the chef for reinventing the familiar taste that Singaporeans grew up with and creating something new and exciting! For the tastebuds now used to Mich standard French, Italian, Dutch, International, whatnot, I found every bite a surprise. The crab linguine was great (as most reviewers have said), the salad dressing for the pomelo salad which came in a frozen ball was just a delight. I would skip the mee tai bak dish in the 3-course but for the rest, must try!! Ok, perhaps you do not get an art piece on your plate for every dish, but the dishes were still a sensory delight. And I do hope the chef never decides to go for the art-on-a-plate ideology because that to me would become pretentious and would lose the Singaporean feel to the dishes. And in terms of price, I found it very reasonably priced for what you get. Next time I get the chance, I would try the chef's tasting menu. I am sure that would bring back lots of nostalgia and memories. How great is that that a dish can do that for you!Thanks Chef

You know that moment when you realize it's New Years Day and you forgot to sort dinner? No? Well I do. A frantic search on Hungry Go Where online booking system showed me just how late we were, very few options were left open, so I cannot say that we planned to head to Wild Rocket, but it had space and we had not being there for over 5 years so we thought we would try.To be honest I had completely forgotten this once fashionable place, boy do I regret leaving it so long. The food is fusion, the menu options limited, but what is there is excellent. We only had one miss which was halibut baked with curry, just didn't seem to work, but the rest did (and we tried everything on the menu as well).One word of advise, safe room for desert, they are quirky and delicious. The service is every bit as good as the food, don't think we will wait 5 years before we try again.If your driving, you can also park in the car park just to the left of the entrance (the Hangout only has parking for 5 or 6 cars and is very tight)
5
This restaurant is quite small, part of an upmarket 'backpackers' hotel & fairly minimalistic. Don't go here if you expecting a luxurious setting & ambiance. However if you love new eating experiences, with highly innovative dishes, true Asian fusion style cooking using everything from pigs ears to French truffles & washed down with some of the best Saki then it's an unfogettable eating experience.The service is also unique with every dish served & explained either by the Chef himself (a UK trained Singaporian lawyer turned master Chef!) or by one of the excellent staff.We tried the 'Omakase' menu (equivalent to a French 'tasting' menu) with 8 very different (& all delightfull) dishes, accompanied by 3 different (& again excellent) Saki's. Not cheap but thoroughly recommended. Unexpected but probably the best meal we have ever eaten in Singapore. We will not hesitate to return
5
Just had Wild Rocket's omakase dinner at the chef's table and the genius of it blew us away. Inventive Singaporean dishes with bang-on flavour profiles. The bak chor mee-inspired scorched tuna tang hoon was just amazing. No attention to detail spared, down to the lovingly-selected crockery. Well worth a visit.
5
My seatmate on the flight to Singapore lives there half of the time, and gave me advice about where to eat. Wild Rocket was a great tip! I was on my own, and eating out solo can be a drag, but I had a wonderful time by treating myself to the chef's table omakase at Wild Rocket. This place is a hidden gem: cozy, modern, with jazz playing in the background. The dishes, 9 of them, were beautifully crafted and delicious. The servers were friendly and knowledgeable, and provided good company for the evening. The chef came out and talked to me about some of the dishes -- including details about the actual dishes the food dishes were served on -- and even brought out a special hand-crafted copper cup for me to have some of my sake from. All in all, a wonderful experience
4
Although many restaurants in Singapore use local materials to create the local flavors, Wild Rocket is more direct in combining the famous dish into its Italian base cuisine. The result is very nice. It's located at foothill with nice environment. And the pricing is reasonable.
4
The 4-course tasting menu (at $78+++) was delicious. The ambiance is cozy, it's perfect for a cozy get together among friends. With Survival Chic's offer of 30% discount, it's fantastic!!
5
Wild Rocket is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. i cringe whenever someone mentions 'fusion food' and images of poorly constructed food flashes across my mind. BUT Wild Rocket isn't fusion, it's an insult to call it such. it's essentially Singaporean, modern Singaporean.Singapore's unique identity is of us being 'rojak' and absorbing other culture's influences and give our take on it, Chef Willin is doing a great job at that.I've tried both ala carte and Omakase on 2 separate occasions, and trust me, when you've spent far too much time and money across the world on multiple meal failures (like me), give Chef Willin's Omakase table a shot.I know i will be back
4
The chef tries very interesting (and sometimes daring) combinations, but we enjoyed every course. Nice ambiance in a quieter part of town. Not cheap, but good price/quality ratio. Personnel was attentive but not upfront. We went for the normal menu, but if I visit next time I will certainly try the 10 course chefs table tasting menu (timely reservation advised
5
I had the seabass and soft shell crab, both were lovely. I usually did not enjoy fusion food too much, but Wild Rocket did such an excellent job on the tastes that we decided to order more dishes to share. And the price was very reasonable too
3
First restaurant before others in the chain, this bare and simply decorated restaurant is hidden away in the nostalgic area of Mount Emily. Their menu is interesting but the dining experience forgettable. A stroll in the area seems to bring one back to the Singapore of the 70s and is way more memorable
5
my son found this place. gem hidden in a residential district. we did find it after going round Mt Emily. we had a rocket set lunch menu. every dish was different from the usual recipes. not cheap. but you have to pay well for good food. The waiters were very good. Indeed one came out of the restaurant to guide us to our further destination. I would highly recommend especially if you want to celebrate an occasion
4
We had the four course menu. Everyone enjoyed everything. I have never had sea urchin capellini before,but it was rich, speckled with caviar, just wonderful. As was the soup and the rigatoni and the almost savoury peanut ice cream It's hidden away, but ever table was full. Portion sizes could have been a little larger is my only criticism
5
Zen-soothing and beautiful constructed wood interior houses a Japanese spin on local Singaporean ingredients -- this is the hallmark of WILD ROCKET. The hidden location, atop of a city hill adjacent to an urban park, makes the dining adventure to find the minimalist space all the better. The care of staff -- Ramiah Thevar was a superb host and returned often to check on me -- was hard to beat. He explained the concept behind the restaurant, the fusion of the chef's heritage and interest in Japan, which proved spot-on in recommending sake to accompany all the dishes. The menu is small, which lends attention and detail to the quality food presentation. The fresh pomelo salad with prawns served with a frozen coconut dressing is not to be missed as your first course. Be bold -- and take the full 4-course set menu. A singularly unique and special restaurant -- I look forward to a return in a different season in order to taste other menu options

Saturday 06/06/15I don’t actually do reviews however I decided not to be lazy and give a review for Wild Rocket because I feel it’s worth doing. I was booked with another person which he lives in Singapore and a local. Not really knowing a great deal about the restaurant I trust my friend who works in food. Walking in I straight away felt comfortable and while it was upmarket, I felt relaxed and the staff were wonderful, easy to talk to and not intimidating at all. We did the degustation which were eight dishes and very rare from my experience but the chef comes out to explain the dish and you can see the passion in him as well. Looking at the wine menu was another experience as I always love a good wine. The restaurant manager Subra is certainly someone who knows his wines and clients. He recommended a wine which at first we thought was a bit expensive but after having a taste, you can see why. I am Australian and have lived in Singapore so I would say try some of the local food then see how the chef does a modern take. So if you are looking for a special night and willing to pay a bit more then don’t miss this place, thanks Subra and Willin and all the staff for making my last night in Singapore a night to remember.Matthew From Sydne

I've never knew Singaporean cuisine can be light and modern. Went there for set lunch with my date. It's fantastic! I might go for dinner there next time.
4
My wife and I finally had dinner at Wild Rocket after hearing so much about it.The restaurant can be slightly inaccessible, but we quite enjoyed the walk up Mount Sophia. The restaurant itself had a warm, comforting interior which put us in a relaxed mood. Service was prompt, although the service staff could have been more helpful in recommending dishes. As for the food, there were hits and misses. We enjoyed the starter of pomelo prawn salad which impressed with its play on textures and flavour. The chili crab pasta and the salted fish pasta were interesting takes on local favorites, although I wished the salted fish flavour was more pronounced in the latter. Mains could have been better seasoned and were not particularly memorable. A gripe we had with the food was its serving portions. We had the four-course set dinner, but we thought the restaurant could have served slightly bigger portions of each course. All in all though, it was a good meal.
4
The food is fresh and unique. We enjoyed everything we tried at this small intimate restaurant. The service was excellent and overall the fusion dishes were tasty and well done. The only complaint, an endemic issue in Singapore, was the AC made the small space very cold. Other than the temp I would highly recommend this truly good and unique restaurant
3
Taste of food can be weird as its fusion. Prices are pretty expensive as well. You can try the set lunch. The only thing worth the try is the dessert. The coffee taste weird as its sour in taste perhaps it's the type of coffee beans used. Not recommended for people who are not used to fusion food
5
Wild Rocket is one of the best restaurants in Singapore with good money value! The food was so creative with fusion of tradition Singaporean food! The location is 15min walk from MRT Dhoby Ghaut or catch a cab for 3min ride.We ordered the 4 course dinner set with a bottle of French red wine. My favourite was the chilli crab pasta with egg, chilli crab is one of the highlighted Singaporean food, cooked it with pasta has created an interesting chemistry. The flavour was very clear and smooth! Amazing combination! Head chef of Wild Rocket came over to our desk and shared that he was a lawyer and found his interest in cooking 10years ago and joined the dinning industry! You can tell that he is so passionate in cooking and delivering great food to other people.Restaurant manager Subra was very professional with beyond expectation customer service. My friend and I were looking for a place for drinks after dinner. He prepared a map of Singapore with a note of famous pubs in city area for us, which is very thoughtful! He also arranged the transportation to pub area
5
Move over chicken rice and chilli crab! We had an amazing 9 course omakase dinner at Wild Rocket. The restaurant has intimate ambience. As we booked in advance, we managed to secure the counter seats which only had 1 seating (Restaurant manager suggested reserving 3-4 weeks prior). The omakase itself was full of creativity. We had pomelo salad with frozen coconut as appetiser and the rest of the courses was filled with a taste of singapore. There was nasi lemak inspired scallop, bak chor mee tuna belly, mashed potato with buah keluak, mythical singapore noodle, pineapple sorbet with soy sauce salt and chili powder, and deconstructed cendol. Chef Willin also made the time to chat with us to share his source of inspiration and stood by the door to bid us goodbye. Our dinner was around $160 but the experience was impeccable.
5
Wild Rocket was for years the place where we took all our guests to experience Singaporean food with a twist - and since it’s reopening, the new incarnation is better! Although the location is super-central, the fact that it’s up on Emily Hill means that you feel” away from it all” -- and 4 different menus (A-la-carte, Four-Course, Lunch Set and Omakase) let you discover all types of modern Singaporean fare, in several different types of settings. If you are lucky enough, celebrity chef Willin Low may even serve you personally. We really enjoyed the whole experience and we will come back for sure
4
Wild Rocket exceeded my foodie expectations with its combination of inventive, creative cuisine, attentive service and romantically lit and cozy dining room. We decided to go a la carte, since neither of us are big on pasta and both the omakase and 4-course fixed price options would have included it. We shared 3 appetizers, one main and one dessert. We could have easily had 1 or 2 more dishes as the portion sizes are small. That being said, we did not leave hungry! Stand-out dishes included the refreshing pomelo salad with tiger prawns and a frozen coconut dressing (a lemon-grassy, slightly spicy coconut ice cream ball sitting atop a salad of mint, cilantro, other greens, sweet pomelo and prawns that was out of this world!), roasted pumpkin and coconut soup with crab roll (not too creamy with a spicy kick), salmon red rice with baby octopus donburi (seasoned and cooked perfectly), and Chinese peanut candy with peanut ice cream (so delicious, we fought over who got the last bite!). My only criticisms are the disproportionately high main prices (when the portions are similar to the appetizers) and a wine and sake list with prices starting at $95. Next time, we'd probably order all appetizers and no mains. All in all, we're glad we chose Wild Rocket for one of our two dinners out in Singapore to be able to try such interesting and skillfully crafted fusion food!

I don’t really want to write this review, because I don’t really want you to go and make it even harder for us to get another booking at this very special restaurant.My girlfriend and I only went to this restaurant because we were invited there by the Restaurant’s Manager, Subra.We have followed Subra to several places where he has worked, as he is regarded by my Events Business savvy girlfriend, as one of Singapore’s most highly regarded Maitre d’s.His new place of employment “Wild Rocket @ Mount Emily” is outstanding.It is in such a cool location at the end of a quiet suburban street, inside a very nondescript Boutique Hotel that we only went into, so as to ask for directions to the Wild Rocket Restaurant. We were highly amused that the Restaurant was in fact in the Hotel itself with a very low key entranceway. It’s like this restaurant is only meant for those in the know.This restaurant provides outstanding service alongside brilliant fusion food. We met the restaurant owner Willin, who was so delighted when we said we were having such fun enjoying the total dinning experience of great service, food, wine, and Sake. All selected by the restaurant staff for our enjoyment.If you decide to go, and manage to, 1. Get a Booking, 2. Find the location, then you won’t regret it. I suggest you try the Omakase Menu. It’s outstanding.However, please don’t book on the nights that we are trying to get in :

Dear owner of Wild Rocket, You really need to make your website works properly. I have not come across a website which is so ill-prepared. The Chinese and Japanese tabs do not work. Only English. Menu is put in dropbox which requires the users to login to drop box to download? instead of direct download. Reservation is hosted by 3rd party which recommends prominently other similar, competitive restaurants. The web page does not scale properly in zoom-in/zoom-out view. There is no way to contact the web master to tell him all these web page problems. There is no email address to feedback these problems
3
Trying too hard on the new blend which does not suit my taste. All I can say after the visit is that I am not a big fan of fushion food.
5
Not the easiest place to find; it is in the Hideaway hotel in an otherwise residential section of the city. But it is worth the trip. Very creative, very tasty food with layers of flavor. The tasting menu is a good value. The service was top shelf, even when it got busy with a couple of larger groups arriving .The only negative was the typically overpriced drinks
5
9 courses prepared in just the right portions for Asians. The dishes are a spin on a local staple like beef hor fan, bak chor mee, chui kway, Thai pomelo salad. The beef hor fan had the burnt wok taste which worked for me but didn't appeal to the people next to us who asked for more salt to mask the burnt taste. I personally think that it's quite sad that people can't appreciate what the master chef has made. To put things in perspective, the chui kway was a scallop sashimi thinly sliced, drizzled with truffle oil and garnished with chopped seaweed to give it crunch. My personnel favorite was the spaghettini with king prawn. The meal ended well with a green tea sugi cake topped with coconut ice cream without dairy.
5
This local chef has certainly pulled out the stops to bring local food and culture into a very tasty omakase fushion 8 course meal. To go for the Omakase you need to book in advance, but there is a la carte option too. We started with a very fresh scallop sushimi. No I wont ruin it by given you every course, and I dare say the omakase changes - this was our first time, I will be back! One of the stand outs for me was the ice cream salad dressing for the Thai salad - second course. Also worth mentioning is the pineapple sweet we had, which apparently harks back to an older SIngapore generation where it is served with dark soy sauce, if it is doesnt sound appealing to you - its worth trying I'm sure you will not be disappointed. My reaction is why and how did Singapore loose this tradition.The house Pinot Noir was affordable (for Singapore) and good, All in all a very tasty meal that my wife treated me too
5
I'll be the first to say, I am not a fan of fusion food for a number of reasons BUT Wild Rocket is one fusion food restaurant I've gone back to repeatedly for one reason.. it's just yummy food. Their desserts are REALLY good too. I would suggest doing the chef's table. Good experience and the staff are wonderful. I loved the hokkaido scallop carpaccio with chaai poh & truffle infusion and the tau yew bah soy sauce pork ragout cannelloni. I hear the Laksa pasta is also great even though I didn't have it. The panna cotta with gula Melaka is finger linking good and for those who like cheesecaje, the strawberry cheesecake is a fav of most. Don't say I didn't warn you, you need to make a reservation, the place is smallish but is a lovely ambience. And the place is not exactly easy to find. I often tell friends that as they drive and when they think they must have either missed it or am on the wrong road to just keep going. It's really at the top of the road. Parking is ok and FREE! you can park in the old bungalow just next door which is an F&B place too
5
We did not do the Omakase menu as we booked late. I was not a fan of the deco as I dislike sharp points and I could not understand the wood installations. But the service was excellent especially Ram and Ravin. We did a bottle of wine but next time SAKE. We ordered their 4 course menu and it was fantastic. The standouts for me was the roasted pumpkin and coconut soup which had a great Thai balance and a spice kick just at the end. Also a must is the quail with Black sticky rice and the balance of sweet, salty and so much more was genius. But the icing for me was the pineapple sherbet with a chilli soya garnish. The taste was a blast from the past. Finally the pandan panna cotta with salted gula Melaka was devine. Yes definitely will be going again
4
Wild Rocket's omakase is a great concept for tasting. I also enjoyed the chef coming out from the kitchen and explaining the concept behind his creation....it gave an intimate touch to his food. I can see that he is very passionate about his food.The omakase started out great with Hokaido scallop. The salad (with coconut ice cream) was interesting, an acquired taste. Unfortunately, there were misses as well such as the hor fun with 48-hour cooked beef. It could have been great...
4
The food is surprising, inspiring and delicious.The portions are adequate, so that you will enjoy the whole menu (not like in some restaurants, where you simply cannot even taste dessert). Although it seems more of a choice for adults, the restaurant accepts also young children, and the chef can prepare a simpler, but extremely tasty, dish for them (ex: pasta & chicken nuggets). Baby chairs are also available.The restaurant is quite small, so make sure to book in advance.Also, have a look at a map before going there (the location is not far from Istana), as taxis often don't know the address
5
I had the pleasure of being a guest in the private dining room of what appeared to be an out of the way, hidden restaurant. But it is worth it! Chef Willin in a genious. This casual to smart casual restaurant is worth finding as the menu is inspired by the chef's upbringing and memories of places he has been too or food he has eaten over the years. My favorite was the scallops with truffles. I highy recommend
4
I was happy to see that Wild Rocket re-opened. Not only is it convenient to home I really enjoy the menu. Hats off to the chef. My most recent visit was a little disappointing in that 2 people in my party asked for a 2nd Mojito and we were told that they were out. Also having spent a few minutes deciding on a wine we were sad when we were told that they were out when we went to order a 2nd bottle. A little more attention to inventory is called for I think. Having said that, they can count on me to return
5
Really good food and great service! Get the chocolate cake for desert - it's amazing! Good mojitos as well..
4
Very special fusion food but at a high price.
Not a place for your daily dinner but special occasions (at least for me).
A meal for 2 will easily cost >$100/-
Menu lacks some varieties too.
5
I had been keen to go back since it's re-opening and it didn't disappoint. The new interior was a definite improvement on the old look and the food was elevated to match too. We were not offered an option for a la carte which was fine for us and they have BYO for a decent corkage charge of $30.The dishes were excellent - for me, the portions were perfect as too often omakase / degustations are so filling that you can't enjoy the last courses because you're bursting uncomfortably at the seams. Here I could enjoy each dish right through to dessert. I'm not usually a fan of fusion but this was an exception - the flavour combinations were spot on as was the use of local fresh ingredients. We would love to return when there are some new items on the menu
5
It was a “All Ladies” gathering for our family and the organizer chose “Wild Rocket”. No one has tried the food except me (during a Charity event). I wasn’t too impressed with the food but looking forward still as I have read of the newly renovated venue and new Omakase (chef’s set menu). As it was a Friday, there are 2 seating (we chose the 2nd seating at 8.30pm as we would like to chat after dinner). Waiting for 8.30pm is a real torture as most are hungry & I was extremely sleepy (Apologies to Chef Willin, not your fault!!!). We began to wonder if the wait is worth it. At the restaurant, we wanted to order a mixture of Omakase and a-la-carte to share but staff encouraged all of us to have Omakase instead so that we can “start & end together”. Initially we were not very pleased about it but oh my goodness, glad we took the staff’s advice. The 8 course Omakase was superb!!! We ended up having 9 courses (one extra dessert). Not sure about the others but I thoroughly enjoyed Chef Willin’s introduction of his “creation" and the “twist” of flavour in each dish. Recently I am feeling kind of depressed after having some “not so nice food” in two other restaurants. I think I am going to cheer myself up at Wild Rocket ;-
5
We were invited by friends to this restaurant hidden inMt. Emily. There is no sign outside and we were not sure to be at the right place. It is a small restaurant but the chef is very creative, with a very creative use of ingredients and mix of flavours. He came to our table at each course to explain what it was. We had I don't know how many small plates, each more creative than the other, and the main course, black cod, was excellent. Our friends had been there several times and said the menu is never the same. Ending with ice cream topped with palm sugar was a treat
5
The new deco is very unique with interlocking wood pieces (the photos on trip advisor are a bit out dated). However it does make the place very noisey. Having said that this place is highly recommended. Chef comes out personally to say hello to all his guest. Super friendly. Not at all stuffy. Nice little touches here and there like utensils in the mahjong table drawers. Food is super. Normally I hate fusion food for everything is so well done and absolutely delicious
3
Was here for dinner with a group of friends, have been waiting to try the food at wild rocket after having a taste of it before they closed for renovations.Had the omakase menu which was not bad, though I thought the portions could have been bigger. Would have also preferred it if the staff changed our cutlery after some courses (they actually took the cutlery that was purposely left on the plate for them to change back on the table). There were hits and misses on the menu, would perhaps come for the ala carte menu in future.
4
Wild Rocket reinvented hits the mark with its courageous interpretation of local cuisine with finesse and attention to detail. For those who are familiar with the local favorites, you will be pleasantly surprised. Love the dessert with pineapple and dark soya crystals! Head to the chef's table for the royal omakase experience
4
If a restaurant has good food, it can be anywhere and you will still find it. Really true for me. Highly recommended by some of my friends, I planned to have lunch there, secluded as it was located atop mt Emily at Hangout Hotel. The lack of a sign made me wonder whether I got the right place, but yeah, well, that's not important since I saw quite a number of people going through the hotel's gates, I figured it must be.The set lunch menu's a steal. $27 for a 2 course meal and $32 for a 3 course meal. Choose from up to 6 starters, mains and/or desserts. I had the (herbal pork rib) bak Kut Teh consommé with foie gras & pork wanton, the baked creamy tau yew bah (soy sauce pork) ragout cannelloni, and a dark lava chocolate gateau with flambé banana ice cream.For one that has always almost equated fusion cuisine with "not so good", this meal was heavenly. Chef willin (renown chef owner of the restaurant) has captured Singaporean cuisine and both successfully fused it with western culinary techniques and presentation, it was an amazing meal.Coupled with attentive but non-intrusive service by the staff, it was a perfect setting for a marvelous lunch.Will definitely recommend this

Wild Rocket is located just blocks from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road in Mt Emily Park. The dining room is quiet and the beauty understated. The tasting menu was perfect for us. We were able to try several dishes and all were delicious. They are very creative in their use of ingredients and flavors. My dessert was a very eggy custard topped with vanilla ice cream and garnished with salted egg yolk. It was excellent

Re-visited after an absence of quite a few years... I remembered I did not enjoy the fusion concept and decided fusion doesn't necessarily work. So it was a very pleasant surprise this time round as the food was great and the service efficient and friendly.We had the soft shell crab and beef carpacio for starters then the laksa and mee siam pastas. We enjoyed all the dishes, and the desserts of chendol, deconstructed cheesecake and chocolate lava cake were a great end to the meal. On ordering we had debated whether to order the lemongrass jelly but did not in the end: the manager brought us one, compliments of the resturantHmmmm..... bribery will get you anywhere - so I will certainly return : -

On our first visit we left feeling this was a very good restaurant for great value. This time it was more a good restaurant - but overpriced. In addition, the service seems to have slipped. We were left waiting at each course - very anyone to top up wine or water. Access to the bottle was challenged - so self service option was not available. The meal was entirely easy to forget - neither great nor poor - it was overall uninspired. This is unfortunate - as our memory from 20 months earlier was so positive. My inclination will be one more try. Maybe Willin is just gone too big and lost some of the edge at this outlet

Wild Rocket is always one of our favourite hangouts, simply because the food is superb, the service excellent, and the entire place is so laid back. What I love is that the menu changes every 4-6 months, because Wilin enjoys trying new things. Our first question to the wait staff is usually "Is there anything new on the menu?", and if you're lucky, so of the old favourites come back again! To top it off, there is usually something special to sample, simply because he's always testing out new recipes. Love the food, the people and the place. Hot favourites for me are usually the salmon don buri, and the nor spaghettini with prawns, and he does a mean steak too. Pomelo granita is a must try, as is the three flower jelly, and of course, the signature strawberry cheesecake; I won't give away the secret, but try it, its like nothing else you will find
4
Decided to come back to an old favorite for a quick lunch. Haven't been here in years. Was very nice to see new innovations on the menu with the chef still trying out new fusion combinations. The nori spaghettini with prawns was sublime and definitely a new favorite for me ... delicious. =)The current wild rocket burger with a spam centre was not bad but not mindblowing for me, I guess mainly because the spam didn't didn't add much to the flavor but just a different texture ...Still... glad I decided to drop by and will definitely be coming back again ..

We stayed in this hotel so we had buffet breakfast here everyday. Every morning's breakfast was something to look forward even if the selection of food was minimal. I loved the smell and taste of the pudding which i ate generously and wished it was served everyday because they changed some of their daily menu. The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly you could feel home. They always had fresh bread topped with butter, jelly and peanut butter which was good because it was my favorite. I loved having beans with it too. The cold sweetened fruits were served daily too. They had huge servings of scrambled egg too. In some days, they served fried rice or cooked noodles. I washed it down with a choice apple juice, orange juice, coffee or cold water. We had a very comfy and enjoyable stay in their hotel not only for the clean accomodations but also because of it delicious food
4
Where else can you be late for a lunch with your loved ones, yet can preorder and have your selected treasures served pipping hot when you arrive? At Wild Rocket the service is attentive yet unobtrusive, and food is impeccable. I had the garlic prawns donburi , chicken kung pao tau kwa stack and the chendol, all a bit quirky but simply delicious. Will be back to try the rest of the menu.

What a surprise ! First of all, the restaurant is in a youth hostel... Not immediately the place for fine dining. Though the restaurant is cozy, with excellent service, good creative food and some really good wines. For OK prices. Not a cheap place but good value for money. We choose the tasting menu which is 10 courses of small portions. Though all together, it is a big meal. All 10 courses were great and they also took care for glutenfree options with glutenfree pasta and more. All very well done...The only minus point was the payment by credit card where some things went wrong and my credit card could not be used. Nothing to do with the food and probably a technical issue.We will be back

Had a wonderful 4 course tasting menu at Wild Rocket. I had read reviews in Luxe Guide and elsewhere, and was interested to try the restaurant. Wasn't disappointed. Very interesting menu from a creative chef mixing local flavors and techniques with global ingredients. Nice portions, good wine list, friendly staff. Out of the way location, but well worth seeking out
5
Excellent restaurant in an odd location. We were actually looking for this place and thought we were in a wrong area, you are driving up a moutain past the park and some urban villas. Its totally worth looking out for this place. The atmostphere and service are without flaws and the food is some sort of refined but personal comfort food. We will definitely be back
5
I guess this is a franchise? It is quite expensive, especially for a youth hostel and I wonder how many hostellers can afford to eat there? it would be nice if there was something, but then Little India is only down the hill.However, the food was excellent, the service was good and it was great to be able to enjoy wine and beer with the meal
3
The breakfast is ok to fill our tummy and to provide energy to start the day. Bread with jam and butter, cereal and milk, beans, toated cheese bread, scrambled egg, coffee and juice.
4
Wild Rocket is tucked away at the top of Emily Hill, and is definitely worth a visit. It's cosy, unpretentious and we felt the place is run with passion and an eye for detail. The tasting menu was very interesting and offered a mix of unexpected flavours. The ceviche, home-made, fish-ball soup, pork, the most unusual Bombay/Bombil Duck with a twist - all good.... and don't miss the desserts. Just Yum! The service was impeccable, the food kept coming in a steady rhythm and our wine glasses were filled…. somehow without any intrusion. It's a different experience. Try it out
5
Wonderful food with contemporary decor, a real foodie's treat. In looking for a nice romantic meal, without paying for a million dollar view, we read a NYTimes review of Wild Rocket and decided to give it a try. Initially surprised that the restaurant is located in the ground level of a hostel/hotel (Hangout @ Mt Emily; where we were staying), the food here speaks for itself…and it speaks loudly. We elected for the 7 course tasting menu which was worth every penny and would standup to any fine establishment in NY, LA, London, etc. Upon hearing we were celebrating our honeymoon they offered two glasses of free champaign, a nice gesture.Unfortunately we had a group of 4 young ladies seated next to us who laughed so loudly that they disturbed the entire room of diners during the evening. Towards the end of our meal the manager approached us and apologized for their noise.We would HIGHLY recommend Wild Rocket to anyone looking for a great meal and extremely nice staff

We stayed at the budget hotel where this restaurant is located and actually rushed back on the last day to try them out before they close for after lunch break. .Many restaurants serve fusion food nowadays. But this is the only one I have come across that does it well. The sliced fish appetizer was simply amazing, and the 3 choices of desserts that we had were marvelous. The mains were nice but the portion was smaller than expected. It was a bit pricier than expected, especially since it is co-located in a budget hotel .Overall worth the efforts in rushing back
4
Was introduced to this restaurant by a friend who is a chef himself and at the end of the meal, we had concurred that it was very very good, in terms of its fusion western singaporean taste. Both starters like the pomelo & prawn salad infused in frozen coconut was really "refreshing" , chilli crab with its milder version of our sauce was tantalizing , main courses like the japanese pasta was heavenly and the grilled fish was another good option. Managed to sample the laksa pesto pasta which was good too. The finale of " pandan flavor panna cotta with its rich syrupy brown " gula " sauce was the way to end the meal. I have been back on 3 occasions over a spam of one month, a very memorable meal indeed. Nor forgetting to mention that the service were impeccable too, always consistent and very attentive without the " annoyance in your face type 
4
Asian fusion type food in a restaurant located inside a budget hotel/hostel. Great concept....wrong location! Most backpackers are after cheap eats. The only reason I dined here was we'd come off a long flight and were too tired to go exploring for affordable places nearby.However, the food was pretty good albeit quite different to anything I've had before. Probably wouldn't dine here again as I prefer street food and we were quite shocked at the prices...$12 for a beer!

We found a recommendation for Wild Rocket in a guide book, as one of the few places offering modern Singapore cuisine, with local flavours incorporated in surprising ways. Very close to the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, but your taxi driver will probably need to look at a map to get you there. Very good service guiding you through the menu, with great recommendations for courses you won't try elsewhere - we loved the mirin seasame octopus, the salmon donburi, and the iberico pork char siew was amazing. We normally skip dessert, but this time loved the chendol (sort of a deconstructed panna cotta with palm sugar caramel, caramel biscuits and kidney beans!). All this and the option of sliders for our daughter - charcoal grilled and delicious. Lunch set menu looked like great value
5
Try the prix fixe 3 course lunch, you won't be dissapointed. Personally I love the Wild Rocket burger but it was off the menu on my last visit. I still found something I liked. This restaurant is in a lovely location at the top of Mt Emily and the ambiance of the restaurant itself is cool and modern. After lunch you can walk down the hill through a park and be in Little India
5
A wonderful culinary experience. The food was all very good and some was spectacular. Really interesting dishes. The space is beautiful too. Particularly loved the roasted black sesame and milk ice cream dessert, that was an unbelievable flavor combination that I know I will never encounter again
5
I cant believe that I have lived behind this gorgous restaurant for nearly 2 years and now I am moving out we try it, and its amazing! We had the 4 course taster menu. The beef cappaccio with ginger for starter was refreshing and delicious. We had the pork iberico was cooked to perfection, it melted in the mouth, some home made pasta and topped off with a honeycomb and local delight desert. I couldnt ask for a combination. The service was fantastic (I dont usually rate Singapore service at all) and the coctails were the icing on the cake. A meal for 2 came to $250 with lots of drinks and full menu, which considering the service was good value for money. The portions may be a little on the small side as we are big eaters but the taste more then makes up for this- just ask for more of the warm bread...We will be returning there this week to entertain my partners boss, we know its a safe choice as service is a must for him
4
I had a delicious piece of sea bass and a great crab-meat-potato-mash concoction. Both excellent, if a bit overpriced. Wild Rocket is a quiet spot in an old converted colonial building. Extensive wine list.
4
good food at the buffet breakfast, even had vegetarian options for us!
5
You simply must go out and visit this lovely restaurant tucked away in Mount Sophia. Nice Fusion menu and an good selection of wines. Just wish I had left room for dessert. Next time for sure!
5
Amazing flavours. A delicious meal and wonderful ambience.
4
The flavours were mingled and balanced skilfully. Loved the chocolate lava cake
4
Hidden in Mount Emily, this place is off the beaten track and next to a youth hostel but the restaurant itself is very nice indeed. The food is delicious and very Singaporean. The dessert here is the best in the world...but that's my opinion, It's the pandan panna cotta that you have to try!
5
I was treated to one of the tasting menus at this marvellous restaurant! Every course was a treat! The service was also very good. I have a milk allergy and this proved to be no problem at all! . This restaurant is worth a visit. Seek it out! You will not be disappointed

The Wild Rocket in Mount SophiaThis lovely, cozy, intimate restaurant has the high quality of an upscale establishment, but with a more moderate price tag. Two "local" friends invited us to dinner at this charming little restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised by its location, and very impressed with the quality of its cuisine (fusipn) and drinks; the warm and efficient service; intimate ambience, as well as its reasonable prices. Per suggestion from our young friends, we took the fixed dinner on the menu and were totally delighted with our selections! Of course, we also enjoyed their martinis and wines.Its location? - I never would have guessed that it is nicely tucked away in a popular HOSTEL, (Yes, in a hostel!), known as the Hangout Hotel@Emily. This small restaurant is quite popular among smart, appreciative locals, thus reservation is recommended.Peterskis, Mar 201

Why go to just another branch of a "famous chef" restaurant when you can come to this little gem and taste perfectly prepared, beautifully presented Singapore fusion food? The chef is local and you will not find his creative blending of traditional Singapore flavors into modern dishes anywhere else. For a truly unique Singapore dining experience, go here. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was relaxing. I wish I could go back for another meal, but I guess this is truly one experience you can only have in Singapore! Don't miss it
4
Wild rocket has done a great job in creating an array of fusion items. i like their asian fused pasta. A strong recommendation for those who want a twist to their local food.Service could have been better especially when the restaurant is packed. Basic elements of service are forgotten. Value wise i gave a 3/5. Pricey for the fairly small portions.Excellent dessert selections, another strong recommendation as happy ending
3
The food fusion is perhaps unusual but not that wild or memorable...but..there is something about the name. Something about the location. Something about the owner. It is a nice place to get away to.
3
Nice location,
Food is fusion and so-so. Nothing great
5
Wild Rocket is an excellent restaurant located in a rather secluded area in Singapore (Mount Emily). The food is excellent and the chef is great!
5
Love the ambience and location, love the food with a singaporean touch & their bar, wild oats is a great place to chill before or after dinner

ADDRESSWild Rocket 10A Upper Wilkie Road, Singapore CUISINE - FUSION Mod Sin (Modern Singapore) Singapore is well known as a “Foodie Paradise “for its vast choices of restaurants and variety of different types of cuisine. Tucked away in a quiet corner surrounded by greenery in Mount Emily, just a short distance away from the main shopping drag of Orchard Road, is one of my most favorite restaurants “Wild Rocket “.It’s décor is stark and simple with dominant colours of white walls, dark brown wooden floors, accented by black pillars. The expansive windows on one side of the room allow diners to enjoy the refreshing view of greenery outside .There is nothing pretentious about this little restaurant and yet it exudes an atmosphere of quiet elegance and coziness. This place is owned by Restaurateur/Chef Willin Low, whose passion has been in elevating modern Singapore cuisine for years. He aptly names his fusion cuisine “Mod Sin” The food is a blend of Modern European, inspired by Singapore flavours, hawker dishes and food that he grew up with as a child.  The results are unique in creativity and “ mind boggling good” I sense Willin’s greatest pleasure is, in creating food that makes his customers happy and satisfied.Everything on the menu brings joy to the Palate. My personal favorites are :•The Crab Pasta •Pasta with Laksa herbs•All fish dishes•Prawn and Pomelo Salad with tender crunchy angle beans •The Pomelo granita dessert, delicious and refreshingly light The food is reasonably priced. A 3 course set Lunch Menu costs SGD 36 ++/ USD 28++ and a 2 course set Lunch Menu SGD 25++ / USD 20++. There is a 6 course tasting menu  at SGD 62++/ USD 49++As an added bonus to diners the restaurant also offers a well assorted wine list at affordable prices. Over-all service is good.Whether living in Singapore or just visiting, don't miss out on an unforgettable dining "Mod Sin" experience at Wild Rocket

I had another excellent meal at Wild Rocket - first time back there since the menu changed. Again, the chef has demonstrated a really good understanding of blending his east west flavours. The portions are just right, and the restaurant has a good buzzy environment. The prawn and pomelo salad was excellent, with lovely angle beans that were tender and crunchy, fish ormok was a twist on the Indochinese dish - again a great balance of flavours and the fish cooked to perfection as usual. The coconut ice cream with gula melaka and the chendol desserts were excellent too

What a nice surprise on Mt Emily! The restaurant offers a fine dining ambience and authentic Singaporean food. The appetizer and entrees were slightly spicy but perfectly acceptable. I espeically enjoyed the grouper laksa. Wonderful fine-dining item inspired by Singaporean street food.The dessert was the one that strike an impact. I had ice cream pudding mixed with salted egg yolk! It was like tasting a cold mooncake. The sweetness and the saltiness complemented each other beautifully. As we celebrated birthday there, the restaurant was so kind to offer us a chocolate lava cake. It tasted wonderful too! Our special thanks goes to Kevin, who arranged the booking and the cake with meticulous attention.All in all, a very enjoyable experience with a very affordable price. This dinner was the best we had in Singapore- better than those in Clarke Quay and Orchard. We will definitely come again
4
We live close buy but where always thinking this is kind of posh place where food is not worth the value. Well, it was a oosistive surprise. We ordered their 62$++ menu for dinner and got some surprising but tasty fusion food. Portions are a bit small and dining room definitely too cold ( thanks to the staff for the shal). We will come bac
3
Place looked nice, too bad they offer no veggie option & their website has listed their menu as 'coming soon' for the past 2 months. How long does it take for someone to post a menu? They are lucky the NY Times gave them a good review, not sure why though...
5
Our taxi driver had a little trouble finding the place, but well worth the confusion. The prix fixe 4 course menu was a great value, but even better - absolutely great food. The fettucine with 5 spice duck ragout was cooked al dente, the soy milk chicken consomme was rich and flavorful (complete with a shrimp ravioli that added a touch of sweetness), and the seabass with congee was light and delicate. The pomelo granita dessert was a perfect balance of tart and sweet. The service was attentive, deferential, and very friendly. Not sure when I'll next be in Singapore, but I will definitely make visiting Wild Rocket a priority. Their sister bar, Wild Oats, located just next door, was a really funky neat place to have a quiet drink outside and enjoy the tropical breeze. Can't recommend either place strongly enough..

Sounds it maybe fun there

Desserts are yummy, though the pasta could see improvement.

Laksa Pesto - excellent and a must try. The roof garden is one a quiet oasis overlooking a busy part of town.
3
A few favourites but menu doesn't change much.
4
got the fusion mix right. try the 3 course dinner. love the tucked away but not out of reach location. take a nice evening stroll afterward at mt emily.
5
Was too late to get food anywhere else, so when it came down to Wild Oats or Wild Rocket, I was divided. Decided to do Wild Rocket (I could drink anywhere) and tried the much established Laksa Pesto, Was not what I expected, it was an Aglio Pasta with Laksa herbs and great! The kitchen opned till late (Think it closes at 10), the chef comes out to meet and greet after the kitchen closes, which is a nice touch. Food is great I can say that again!The restaurant has a wine selection, for beers and cocktail, head next door to Wild Oats (same owner
4
Nice and interesting italian food. You can try the laksa spagetti.

Fusion cuisine - mix of Western and Local flavours. Chef - Wilkin mingles with the guests to gather feedback on the food.

Don't know why...just love it...great to walk down the hill after dinner too.

Owned by lawyer-turned-cook, Willin Low, this fancy restaurant whips up a brand new version of our local cuisine. Expect familiarity and excitement all at the same time with his creative dishes.

Go Relish for the Burgers! Cluny Court!!

Overhype. Very limited choice. Expensive but the service was excellent. The waiter had the plate of pasta changed when he overhead my friend saying that she dislike seaweed. The chef whipped up another pasta specially for her at no extra charge. Cool right. The desserts was nice though
