Lots of variety to choose from. They even have a teppanyaki section. The pork satays is really worth the patience to wait for it freshly grilled. Food wise is great and so is the quick service. Overall, it's worth it!

Went on weekday dinner.
Wide varieties of selection. Fresh sushi and oysters. Loved the western and Japanese dishes.. but the grilled fish head was way too normal and need long queue.
4
A very wide spread of seafood, beef, pork, etc. International variety available like teppanyaki, Japanese curry, pizza, etc. A wide variety of desserts to choose from. Hot coffee/tea, juices and soft drinks inclusive.

Stumbled across this place by accident, great find. Had been travelling for a while and was sick of eating out and not having hearty meals. This place has roast beef, and vegetables, also a lot of japanese foods. I did find a lot of the buffed food was cold though so they really need to work on that. The desserts were great too. So basically if you are sick of eating out and want some variety go here. I do think it was over priced though, I think it was around $45-$50? can't remember
3
Have visited Buffet Town numbers of times.Lunch on Thursday found good Varieties but lack quality !Quality for the Western,Teppanyaki,Peanut soup and satay remind good.Desserts spread have improved.Nothing special to said about the Grilled fish head.Need to queue to my surprise only limited 1 piece per person.You don't expect my wife to join the queue and leave her belonging on the chair hoping someone look after our items on the chair. Maybe consider issue tokens if you want to limited per person for Fish Head.Buffet mean pick your favorites food unlimited not to queue to stand just for 1 piece per person.The only plus point is your staffs were very Friendly.Have the choice of buffet I'll likely give a miss at Buffet Town unless some improvement been make

Visited this buffet restaurant on New Year Day for buffet lunch... Spread is so so.. and some food displayed are too cold, overcooked. I had tried many other buffet restaurants, they have warmer which the cooked foods is still hot and warm. But nothing happened in this place. Not recommended
3
Chill crabs , teppanyaki, herbal soup and more! All in one food place for buffet yet. Some of things are simply not recommended by me. 1) herbal soup (simply Taste like plain water) 2) teppanyaki (some of the dishes which I choose from myself was handle with care by the Chef yet it's a over-cooked and there's burn smell) Free-flow of oyster but there is no lemon to be seen at the sauce area only Tabasco. Chilli crab is over spicy because I had tried many places of Chilli yet this place is just spicy. One of the few things not to miss is their steam chicken and laksa.
3
Visited on a Monday, the twelve of us enjoyed the spread.We noted the wide variety whilst checking them on line, so was quite satisfied except for the missing Lobster & Pepper Crab dishes.We didn't miss the fresh Oysters, cold prawns & Cray fishes. The commends were that it is worth the value to pay (wonder if this place could make some dollars with its charges of S$36.80 ++). The uncle standing behind the Oysters were cheerful, expressive & hard at work topping up the fresh oysters. In fact 3 of us were given a factual history of how Oysters are grown & that their Fresh Oysters are from U.S.The Saba fish & Salmon Fish Heads were good. But the chilli crabs were too sweet & the serving staff behind this counter were not in a mood & the action speaks
4
The buffet spread was amazing ranging from seafood, sushis, sashimis, chilli/black pepper crabs and many more. The only issue is, there is a long queue prior to our entering the restaurant. This could be due to their promotion during the mth of July. Overall, try to come early for the queue, the food is definitely value for money. Will definitely come again
5
Service was excellent with welcoming staff and very good table service. We attended the seafood buffet. Wheel chair access for those who need this. A bountiful supply of seafood. All except for lobster which would not be expected for the $80 price. A large range of international cuisine. No liquor license. Soft drinks, tea and coffee included. A great night out and wholeheartedly recommend to others. Dress is casual and tidy. By Restaurant Ramblings
5
Good location even it is on the basement floor, easy to find.
Big variety of food, fresh and delicious.
There is a small playground area where my kids enjoyed it so much when they are full.
3
had an evening meal here looked busy so thought we would give it a try
Save Your Money
Compared to English Buffets its got very little to offer
i would say its a Tourist Trap
there are plenty of better places to eat close by
2
It was a good spread of buffet with variety: seafood like prawns, crabs, seashells, cut of roasted beef n roasted pork, own selection of beef or chicken for teppanyaki, pizzas, Japanese curry, teriyaki chicken, fried chicken, lots of desserts, cakes, fruits, even choices of hot coffee n tea n lots of juices/soft drinks. The cooked food tend to be a bit dry. Taste for most dishes could be better. Not really good value for money.

I was searching for a place to dine at Raffles City Mall and chance across the review of this restaurant. It has a mixed review on trip advisor but generally the review was good. I did not make any reservation as it was a last minute decision.We queue up and got in around 15 mins time and staff was friendly.They got it to seats near the mini playground which has a TV and a few toy. Kids were happy and we started to get some food to eat.Selection is normal (the usual sashimi, prawn etc, tempura, some cooked food- fried rice , noodle), mini pizza, mini cheesecake, kueh lapis and fruits. There is also salmon head, satay and crepe.Although there are a good variety of selection, quality was just so so. There are hit and misses with the quality of the food.Generally I did not enjoy the food here and would not think of revisiting.Food price is moderate for the area in Raffles City but not worth due to the quality of the food
4
The USP of this place is that they offer local coffee and tea instead of the standard coffee machine and tea bags most other restaurants offer. Food wise, huge variety but a lot of carb options. They also have a nice bread section with many types of butter such as garlic , herbs, etc
2
Yes there are a lot of choices but if it is available. Almost all the items are empty and you have to wait for the food to be replenished. I do get it that they want the food to be fresh but they should be able to plan based on the crowd size. The salmon head took a Long time, Same with the satay and the tempura. Even the drinks took time to be replenished. There's no crab available when I went in last Saturday night. For a weekend dinner price, I would expect better selection. Tips: reserve if planning on coming. Walk in takes a Long time to be seated.
5
In my opinion, this restaurant serves the best buffet at Raffles. Food is replenished often. Food is delectable and palatable. I immensely enjoyed their diverse seafood buffet. Got my hands really dirty and fishy, am truly a shrimp and crab monster. I also stuffed myself with a lot of sushi and sashimi. I completed my dinner with a dessert indulgence. Even the tea and Kopi is unlimited. I was not able go through all the buffet stations because there are plenty to choose from the Korean, Thai, Japanese, Italian, Singaporean, Indian, Malaysian among others. This place gets crowded so better come early or book in advance.
3
We had our dinner in this place just to try it. You need to pay first before dining. We were escorted and seated. In spite of available couch seat which we requested, we were turned down for whatever unknown reason. Food selection is very little. Since variety is small, we opted to just eat oysters & shrimp. I took one serving of laksa which is good. Chili crab is actually crawfish. Tempura veggies are cold and not crispy. Softdrinks is self service. I like their coffee.The food is filling but taste is very ordinary.
2
I used to frequent this place with my family when it first opened many years back. We stopped months later after the standard dropped. Today we patronised them again, in hopes that things might be different. Those hopes were misplaced.Seats were stained. Utensils were unclean. Food was mediocre. Service was average, but one can tell their staff were not trained well. Their staff may not have ill intentions, but the way they stare at every customer entering the restaurant made us felt unwelcome. I believe they wanted to make sure that patrons entering had paid for their seat.The fried chicken was the most tasteless fried chicken I've had in my life.If you must visit this place, I'd recommend their fresh prawns and bean curd (豆花). The chicken rice chilli and ginger was good as well.Otherwise, find a better restaurant

Last Night we had one of the best feeds in Singapore. After 3 weeks travelling Asia it was awesome to get a great feed. Buffet Town was awesome, everything was fantastic. Everything we ate was cooked prefect. They have all sorts of food from all over the world. For $36.80 a person you will get your money's worth. They have seafood, and good seafood. They have bugs, prawns and oysters. Also a must is the Singapore Crag Soup. Make sure you come here and have a feed, it is so worth the price. The price also includes soft drinks, coffee, tea and water. Buffet town even has a kids corner with some games and TV, which have us a bit of time to relax and eat.Buffet Town is worth a visit, will be back again soon Cheers 10 out of 10Make sure you try the chicken satay and the chicken wings....bang on Goodness
3
Foods served are just normal but staffs are helpful and service is good. Rate is reasonable base on the food served.
2
Average spread, the food is of average quality too. There was a long queue for the bbq salmon head which they they could consider giving numbers than to have people standing in the queue.
2
Although this place has a wide range of food but the food base is duplicate as it cooked in different style.
Not worth the trip to come as hot station cooking is slow and will expect long wait.
3
Booked and paid for CNY reunion dinner for the 2nd session that starts from 8pm ~ 10pm. The place was totally packed and the queue was super long. The staff simply cannot handle the crowd. By the time we are allow into the restaurant, it was already 8.30pm. One of the counter near the fresh seefood can be seen as cleaning & washing up. Believe all the guests were totally hungry at that time and took whatever food that were left over from the first session. Sadly to said that none of my family and relatives enjoyed the food nor service. Will never go again
4
Salmon & Tuna sashimi, prawns on ice, oyster. My favourite. Crabs - do not expect the quality kind that was served in seafood restaurants. Still i am not complaining cause still get to eat chilli crabs here. Just that serving a bit slow. You can find Tempura stuff n pizza too. Limited choice if desserts too. Will i come back? Maybe
1
The whole team of service staffs were very rude! We had a very bad experienced dinning in this restaurant. From the entry point to all their counter serving staffs, we can feel their unhappiness. We were told-off not just once but by a few of their staffs. In particular, MR ADRIAN LIM was extremely rude and arrogant. Hygiene was also an issue, we were still eating and the staffs started washing the floor
3
Not satisfied.. It has quite a selection of food from cold to hot dishes.Tried almost all dishes.The cold dishes was fine and for hot dishes is below average except for the braised pork and Fish are nice. Chilli crab taste funny,Desserts was alright..Staff at the hot station has an attitude when we were asking what do they serve. Advisable to bring along a cardigan or jacket as the Air condition is too cold.
3
You need to make a reservation if you are going to eat at Buffet Town, because it gets crowded easily. There are various food choices - from American to Japanese to Singaporean fare.Was not very impressed with the food, though. The flavors were not appetizing.The service staff, however, were pleasant and responds fast to service concerns
2
Food was average with a selection of seafood and some hot local dishes. Tried most of the dishes, broccoli was under cook and still raw, oysters are alright. Imagine cold crab served tossed with some chilli sauce or black pepper sauce, and the sauce is cold too.
5
We celebrated hubby's birthday at this lovely dinner joint at Raffles City Shopping centre. What really caught my foodie attention was their signature crab, buns and savory sauce. If it's too spicy, just remember to walk yourself to the organic soya milk beverage stall. Overall dining experience was superb
3
The food was ok though hoping for more selections. Lack customer service - SMILE! Location great. Value for money. Oysters only served at dinner.
3
buffet is average, but it is considered cheap for about $40 lunch, eat all you can. the satay is very juicy and tasty. highly recommend the satay. the salmon fish head is also nice. the rest is just so so.
5
Great place to grab an asian influenced meal in one of the many eateries. Food is hot, fresh and very courteous and helpful staff. Have been many times to this place and never disappoints. The price is also very good.
2
We got to the restaurant at 8:30pm, knowing full well that we still had 1.5 hours to eat. Their credit card machine didn't work right away, but the host let us start our dinner first and pay later, which was great! As we went around to look at all the food, it seems as thought many items were nearly gone and they were starting to break down the stations already! I reckon we only had 2/3 or even 1/2 the selection of food and we still had to pay full price even though there was 1.5 hours left. The sushi rolls were miniature and the chili "crab" (the chef gave me what looked like crawfish instead) was inedible. The satay chicken was delicious and the only thing that redeemed my dinner somewhat was the chef cooked me 10 skewers of satay chicken as they were tearing down the station and I filled up on that and Hainanese chicken rice. The chef manning the Hainanese chicken/laksa station was quite rude - when I wasn't sure how to order noodle soup, he barked "double boiled?" at me, to which I just said "yes" because I didn't know what it was or what he meant. Before I write this place off completely, I would one day return for an earlier meal where the full selection of food was available

This is the buffet for seafood lovers.. If you are one, you will be loving it! There are oysters (dinner), crayfish, prawns, mussels, scallops. I wallop down lots of crayfish and oysters! The oysters were freshly opened by the staff and placed on the ice. One thing though, the crayfish is whole piece, you need to cut it open yourself. No wonder it didn't run out as fast. Apart from the cold seafood, the teppanyaki grilled salmon head is really nice as well. I think I have 2-3 servings of it, you have to queue for your share though, as it is one of the more popular stations. The other stations will be the tempura, chili crab (I find the sauce so-so only) and satay(always full, so I didn't get to try, anyway not very keen since I'm not a meat person).As for drinks, their selection can definitely rival or even surpass some hotel restaurants! There are juices, coffee, tea and even soy milk. It's not the diluted type either, is those freshly made type that taste like Mr Bean/Jollibean. Yums..I would definitely recommend this place for seafood lovers. Meat lovers though will have nothing much to chew on. Do make a reservation especially for weekends, as the place is always full. Even with reservation, you will still need to queue to go in. Try to go early, as soon as the buffet starts, so the crowd is not as bad yet
4
Hard to find a table in the main meal times but the food was fine. Located on the lower floor so no views to consider but a good choice of food. Western and local cuisine, with some Japanese added to the mix. Prices are high after arriving from Sabah
5
This restaurant serves International buffet, with good samples of local specialties such as Laksa, Chicken rice and Rojak. And International buffet being the theme, they also offer Japanese style cuisine such as octopus and salmon sashimi. The restaurant have good quality control in raw fish as the sashimi is kept in cooling temperature and only sliced and serve on-demand.There is also a good spread of salad bar offering, with vegetarian and non-vegetarian dressings, not forgetting on-demand teppanyaki dish with chicken, pork and beef with fried vegetables. I'm also impressed with the variety of desserts available, from fruits, cakes and nonya pastries to local desserts such as barley boiled drink and chendol.The restaurant also has a family corner where families with kids and baby on wheel prams can sit with comfortable and spacious environment and even cartoon screening television to keep kids occupied.The only short coming I can pick is sometimes you need to queue up for serving of hot water at a Singapore traditional coffeeshop-styled counter because it is not manned at all times. But other cold beverage can be obtained from self-served drinks dispensers
4
The fresh oysters were delicious though small. They also served cheese baked oysters, oyster porridge, and oyster omelette. Tasted great too. Other cold seafood dishes included prawn, mussel, crayfish (quite blend) and topshell (I think). Because it was a Friday dinner buffet, there were chilli and black pepper crabs too. A little bit spicy for me however.The Japanese cuisine station was nice too. We liked the salmon sashimi and ebi sushi. My sons liked the teppanyaki station.The roasted beef, soya sauce fish and chicken were good.I could make my own Chendol. The Gula Melaka syrup was thick and it made the Chendol super good! There were also other deserts and 4 flavours of ice-cream (actually one of them is Yuzu Sorbet).I think the spread was quite reasonable at $56 something per diner
5
I've just been let in on news (actually it's on their Facebook page now) that there is a OSYSTER promotion starting today.Not sure how the queue will stack up but I reckon Singapore may be seeing an influx of oysters these couple of weeks/months due to the F1 build-up and climax towards the end-of-year christmas season.There will be interest in this shellfish cos we all know how expensive it is and how desireable it makes us after eating it.Good luck with the queue. It's worth it.Note that this is a public buffet restaurant. Unlike hotel buffets, this one can be quite challenging, especially with fancy foods we desire. People stack up plates with glorious amounts of food. Good food is always out in minutes if not seconds. Then you'll just have to wait for another serving to be prepared. Don't be shy.Steal, take, eat, overload. Exercise can come tomorrow
5
The whole food court on the bottom of the Raffles shopping mall is amazing in the diversity of choices, so, if you have a hard time making a decision, please give Buffet Town a chance. Fresh and diverse choices from seafood (fresh oysters in the half shell) freshly cut sashimi, hot an d cold noodles, satay, skewers, crepes, pastries, sorbets, etc. Staff could have not been more helpful or gracious. Good value
5
I love that they have a lot of variety in their food. We love the seafood and sashimi feast. It is out nth time and we still love it!
4
full with alot of foods, especially i prefer the asian foods as i m asian
prior to reservation if want having a buffet meal
1
This was my second visit to the restaurant after a long time. Sad to say, the standard of both the food and service has dropped tremendously. The timing for lunch stated at the entrance was till 3.00 p.m. but by 2.20 p.m. they stop replenishing the food e.g. satay counter (which by the way was the nicest). The range of cold seafood was also very limited: crayfish, prawn and oysters. At one section, the remaining food was dished out and left on plates (not very hygienic and something I would not expect to see). At 2.55 p.m. when I wanted another bowl of beancurd, the waiter said it was already 3.00 p.m. and no longer serving food. You will not believe what happened next, all the staff took out the "leftovers" which they started to keep before 2.30 p.m. and started their own "feasting".For the price we pay for lunch buffet, I believe we deserve and can get better food and service else where! Will not go back for sure
2
i used to think that this place was pretty good considering the queues i used to see. so i decided to treat my family to dinner. i was sadly mistaken. service staff probably needs to be trained to be friendly or at least smile a bit. the person who ushered us through the queue did not say we had to pay at the cashier before being let in. never mind, so i paid at the cashier. then followed another service staff to a table. fine and good. the spread was certainly not what i expected. there is seafood but the quality isn't good. the cooked food were not appetitizing at all. desserts were limited. oh ! there was chilli crab, but sadly the sauce was just so bad. on the whole, the quality of the food is passable, and for amount we paid, it was pricey. i think i enjoyed the satay the most. service is almost non existent. we had to get the service staff's attention to get our plates cleared. so definitely won't be returning
1
Terrible experience even TRYING to dine here! We have made an online reservation 2 weeks prior to our booking date, however we did not receive any confirmation or otherwise.We even tried sending in our reservation a week later and clearly stating that we have not heard from them. No response was given either. Thus, we decided to give the place a call but to no avail. Despite multiple calls, you will never be able to get through their line. They did not even bother to drop us an email stating that Reservation on the date is full,etc. When we arrived, there was a whole stretch of queue which was barely moving and service staffs werent friendly either. Doubt i will be ever trying to dine here again
1
In short, I will never come again.. I use to dine her a couple of times with my friends and it was never this bad.. Food quality is getting worse, plus please retrain ur staffs to smile and be polite in their words..!! We are paying customers, not dining there for free.. Seriously not recommended..!
3
Arrived at 7pm on a Tuesday night. The place is conveniently located in B1 of Raffles City, easy to find and there are lots of tables. After a short queue, we were ushered in by friendly staff. But, the place we sat was next to the tray/plates return area and it was very hot there. The smell and the heat didn't make a great start.Next, there are lines at almost all the food counters. And for those without lines, it's because there weren't any food left. The crowd was so big that I guess the restaurant couldn't keep up.We had to wait in line for quite a long time for the popular items eg., satay, oysters and sushi. Sometimes, we had to go back a few times because the items ran out. Kinda sad really... Felt a bit like homeless people in free food kitchen. The heat in my area made it more unbearable.I was perpiring too much to enjoy the food.Too bad. Because I was told the food tasted good
1
This is in conjuction with their 5th year anniversary .. 2 for $75. Long q, lousy food. Everywhere you go is long queue..take drinks too and diluted. Everything also need to q. Sashimi of weird red colour, though fresh. Asked for salmon belly, the chef made it so difficult to slice some parts here n slice some parts from a hidden container.. Wont go again. Not worth even $10/pax.Sorry guys, first time no pic..didnt want to rem this experience
5
Lobsters, Shrimps, Oysters, Snails, Clams, Mussels and more... I also loved how they cook their Chili crab. Lobsters, shrimps and oysters served fresh! Japanese maki, sushi, sashimi and tempura. There are also grilled food, laksa and other dishes. The price includes drinks and coffee. I also like their dessert station. They have lots of dishes to choose from... delicious... but make sure to reserve seats...The line can get impatiently long
5
A lot of foods & beverages varieties. I think it is the most value for money buffet in town.My husband like the coffee station, it could be the only traditional handwork left in the buffet restaurants here. And it is the only buffet restaurant that server fresh soya milk and Douhua
5
Been here for the 3rd times in different year..One of the best buffet food with not that expensive but the quality of food THUMB UP!. All nicely cooked..Love the grilled fish head!
3
Decided to revisit Buffet Town after a few months away. Food quality standards seemed to have dropped at some stations. The food still retains its freshness, especially the oyster bar. The wait at the teppanyaki section is still as long.
3
Not quite sure what we were expecting but bit underwhelmed. Food choice was about average. Some very nice, some less so. Seemed bit luke warm in places. Wouldn't dash back.
2
Me and my family booked a table for 6 and one child on 9th May 2016 for the dinner service. After spending about 3 hours inside the restaurant, all of us agreed together that the experience didn't translate properly to the location and price charged. Despite the wide range of food available, the quality were considered mediocre to us and we find that there are buffets outside of the Buffet Town Restaurant that are of much better. The price charged for the buffet was heavily overpriced. Food served aren't really that great.Also, we personally find the sanitary conditions at certain stations (especially the drinks station) were bad. My relative got a bowl of laksa and was unpleasantly surprised to find a small piece of paper inside. We did pass on the feedback to the relevant cook who was in charge of the dish. However, according to my relative, he was treated with little respect. Plates should be cleared almost immediate by the staff. We had almost 7 plates stacked up at one point.The queues for the food stations weren't properly managed. I spent more time queuing up than eating the food. This was something I didn't personally expect.Despite all its negatives, I personally find the mushroom soup and its baked fish pretty good. Oysters were quite fresh.I don't think I will return again. But, I don't mind returning to see if things have improved or not

A widespread variety of local cuisine from the infamous Hainanese chicken rice to Bak ku teh (pork rib soup) to satay (skewered beef and chicken over charcoaled fire) dipped in peanut sauce complemented with cucumber, big onion and kutupak (cube steamed rice) is sure to satisfy your thirst for true blue Malay fare. A good place for tourists and locals to savour our local fare in aircond comfort.It has also brought the wonderful Lok lok (meat and seafood from Malacca) to its patron delight as the chef will assist you to cook it. After that you can choose your various dips of chilli and peanut sauce. The choice has not ended .... you can visit the teppanyaki counter for your vegetables to be fried and also the sashimi and sushi counter for your Japanese delights. But alas! I experienced the ugly well reviewed, rude, bad service at the Japanese counter where they even snatched yes snatched your plate or rudely "give me your plate"! Wow! Very different from Hi dozo. The Management should oversee this unpleasant service that does not fit the fresh beautiful food of sashimi and sushi that has a good following. They should learn from the friendly and warm desserts counter staff that even serve a fresh plate of chocolate mousse cake around 2.45pm almost closing time ... this is SERVICE .. tq most appreciated. If you have a sweet tooth you will be spoilt for choice here from cendol to ice kachang with soy milk instead of coconut and for fillings pls help yourselves ... very generous. Varieties of cakes and sorbets are also offered. Rojak our local salad of turnips cucumber bean curb yu char kueh (deep fried flour doughs) mixed with peanut, chilli paste and prawn paste drizzled with assam juice.... try it you will not regret it.The cold platter of crayfish, oysters, big crunchy prawns are placed at the entrance to welcome you ... a good strategy.This restaurant also welcome seniors at only S$25 and a discount is given. A good meeting place for families.

1st visit to buffet town, price was all right 2 adults, a teen and a kid we paid $150+.Crew service was poor. When visit seafood station, food quantity was Low, the kitchen crew topping food up was throwing food pc by pc slowly...attitude not nice at all..Crew clearing dishes from table hover dishes over our heads! And you Guess rightly, sauce drip on my partner's head!Food quality 3/5Food taste 3/5Food variety 4/5Ambience 4/5Plus point, there is a play area for kids and this large restaurant is in a enclosed environment so safe for kids to be in play area with minimum supervision.It's gonna take me a Long time to want to come back again
5
We were a group of people who attended buffet town last June 2015, service was excellent as I booked with Adrian who organised an area for us, It was a group of people meeting up before our cruise the next day. The food was excellent and a variety for everyone's tastes. Highly recommend eating here and our group all enjoyed their meal
4
Likewise as usual the landline was very busy but i have to wait and was lead to the mail. I saw on the renovated restaurant has a new number but it was through sms. So i gave a try. To my surprise, within minutes they responded. I cheer a very good souce for people to make reservation. Drop ur details and don't have to worry about it.
3
Heard plenty about this place. Whilst the selection is wide, the overall quality can be improved. Oysters should be opened when ordered, while refills of dishes should be automatic. To tolerate long queues for supposed good quality Japanese grills at the high price is questionable. My first visit, may not be my last, but I would seriously consider.
3
Went here to celebrate new year with friends. The selection was wide but popular food like crab and prawns ran out fast and slow in replenishing. Wanted to take them for 3 occasions but always empty so I just gave up. Some staff are quite disorganised and rude. Overall ambience is nice, but the customer service and food management nedd to be improved. The rest room inside the restaurant was small, dirty and slippery, will suggest to use the rest room outside buffet town instead
3
Come here for lunch and see nothing special served.
There are great variety of food served such as seafood, sushi, satay, fried stuff ( fries, tempura etc), roasted stuff (turkey), soups, fruits platter and dessert
Not very pricey and this restaurant is quite spacious
4
Salmon, prawn, tempura, salmon fish head etc. Good local Asian delights. Also value for $$, with such food variety. Decent food and large sitting capacity. Great locations also. Easy accessible by trains.
3
For those who love buffet, here you will find quite a good spread of selection. In the heart of town and easy access by MRT.
4
It's worth it! Best "buffet in town".. A lot of varieties to choose from. The grilled Salmon fish is a must as well as their satays. Love their seafoods and fresh sashimis 😋😋
4
This place was great for me, someone who had trouble finding food in Singapore, but I must say be careful to not stuff your face! I ate so much I couldn't move after! (Went Summer 2012).
2
There are two lines to get in- one for ppl with reservation and one for walk in.We lined up twice in the "walk in cue", and twice walked away after 20mins. They prioritise people who make a reservation 24hrs ahead, and make sure the reserved line is clear before allowing a single person in the walk in line in. On a busy night there could be 100 ppl in the reserved line and 100 in the walkin line. So basically people in the walk in line have 0% chance of getting in, and most if not all walk away disappointed. Buffet town should get rid of the walk in Q line, as people just end up disappointed and angry anyway. Should just put up a sign saying " no booking = no chance to get in".

This buffet restaurant is located down the basement of the Raffles Shopping Centre. I would advise people to ring and book a table or even do this online as the line can get quite long if you don't have a booked table.We booked in online the night before and received a a confirmation for the table. We had to a go to a separate line which was quite short for customers who booked in for a table.I requested for a table close to the play area as I had my 7 year old with me at that time and we were granted that request. The stations were scattered all over the place so make sure you venture around as you might end up missing a nice dishThey had seafood, italian, japanese, western, pastas and teppanyakis cooked to order. At dinner time, you can request for either a Chilli crab or peppered crabs.The food was nice but average. The sashimi were sliced as you order to keep it fresh. That I would say was very nice.The people who clear the plates were lovely however the ones who cooked the teppanyaki and chili crabs were not very friendly looking. Perhaps a nice smile would make a lot of difference.There are a number of sodas and juices available along with hot drinks. The price was reasonable and would not mind returning

 This was my first time here last Wednesday with my colleagues. Found quite bad reviews for this restaurant. However due to we are quite big group and unable to reserve another place last minutes. So we just give it a try. Surprisingly it doesn't disappointed us. For paying this range of price but you will get lots variety food. I found it valuable! And the oyster was so fresh and nice. And the other food also quite tasty too.. Overall, it is good as you are paying only $36.80 an adult for dinner

Great variety of food! Go there if you are very hungry! With so many food to choose from so many food stalls, one can feast from a smorgasboard! It is a perfect place to hang out with friends, enjoying long conversations while filling your stomach by selecting the food you want to eat

We went by as a family for a weekday lunch. The restaurant accepts reservations in-person, so if you're in the Raffles City shopping mall early before the buffet opens, you can make a reservation and avoid the frequent queues to get into the buffet. There's a wide range; including western, sashimi, asian/local, Italian, and also a serviced hot beverage area. Most of the fare is average, but a couple are unique and pretty good: including the grilled Salmon head (we suspect some diners camp themselves at neighboring tools to the station here!). Other extremely popular items that get cleaned up real quick are the pork satay sticks. There's also a station for crabs, but that wasn't open for our weekday lunch - it's apparently only open for weekend dinners.All-in, it's decent value for the asking price especially for weekday lunches, and it wasn't too crowded at our visit

As a westerner who is not very adventurous with food, I found the food very tasty and lots of it for a reasonable price
3
Been to this buffet restaurants on many occasions but was disappointed with the shrinking spread this time.
Wonder what happened but the crowd seems unperturbed. Probably the price kept it affordable but the standard of the food and the spread had definitely dropped.
3
Good atmosphere and great food served here, fresh shashimi corner, fresh made pizza, and seafood + oyster, everything was fine.
But overexpectation as it don't really cover much food, it's my own opinion. (comparing to buffet at ShangriLa hotel and Buffet at Orchard Central)
3
Food is average, good spread, I like the chili crab, bearable spice but I mainly I come here to eat oysters and crayfish especially..
5
Buffet Town has great variety of food with affordable price. Child below 6 is free. Having small kid's corner let the children have fun.
5
this place is really very good for dinner with childrens, cause their childrens can play at the corner playground, while the parents can dine in peacefully.
and the food are also very fresh and have varior choices.

Heard it from a friend that buffet restaurants are not that common in Singapore as in Taiwan and Buffet Town is one of the best. To be honest, the quality is ok. However, the variety is amazing. There are several stands in the restaurant, and each stand serves food of different themes. There are Japanese, Nyonya, Indian, Chinese and Malaysian. So, if your time in Singapore is limited, this is probably a great place to get a taste of everything in one meal

Ok folks let's put it in perspective all you can eat Asian Buffet. About $40/head after tax and service charge.It does include non alcoholic drinks including soft drinks, water, iced tea and hot tea and coffee.You also have an extensive range of deserts. Like waffles and crepes made in front of you, jelly, ice creams, sorbets, cakes, chocolates fondues, banana fritter etc.The mains are also extensive starting with cold seafood....oysters, mussels, scallops, Morton bay bugs, crab, prawns, etc.Hot foods include extensive fish, chicken, beef , lamb and pork dishes. Tempura, stir fries made to order...you just put the ingredients on your plate and the cook makes it for you....I think your getting the picture. Lots of variety and plenty of food there are also veggies No one should leave hungry
4
We were struggling to find a reasonable restaurant with a good range of food until we found this one. It is very busy so it pays to book.Cost is about $40 depending on the day of the week.Oysters,prawns and bugs are a good starter and then move around various food stations....Indian,roast meats,pizza,sushi,various Asian dishes and in the weekend,chili crab .There is a dessert area,free soft drinks and a kids playgroundGood value for money but it is crowde

This restaurant serves a great variety of food. The sushi and salmon bar greets your right at the door and they serve huge amount of raw salmon, unlike many other restaurants. Situated opposite the Japanese food are cold served crayfish, scallop, prawns and mussels. You can find a pasta station where they served various pasta and pizza. Moving inwards you will find local delights where beef & pork satays are served together with fried rice, beef, vegetables and many other local flavours. One of my favourite is the Salmon porridge. As you move along, you will see a stall that serves Chicken rice. The dessert section was a good experience. The cakes, cheng teng and red bean soup were all very yummy. Fruits was also served there.What caught my attention was the "coffee shop" counter. Here, they served coffee and tea with clear explanation of the varies kinds of Coffee and Tea from Kopi-C to Teh O.I ordered a Kopi and the milk and coffee used was a great experience for me. Overall, I enjoyed my meal in this restaurant

got a flyer as i entered raffles city from city hall .. special all you can eat $25 hungry so found it.. most amazing range of foods for all tastes never seen a better buffet

We booked a table for 8 guests and everyone came back with mixed reviews of the place.Definitely value for money but the place was horrendously packed and very warm. The variety of food was average at best and spread out at different counters to give the illusion of variety. Be prepared to queue for your food. After a while we just realised all the waiting was meant to make you feel full faster and you do spend quite a bit of time queueing for food, trust me! It's an absolute rip off if you ask me.We managed to get a few plates of sashimi, which was limited to just salmon, tuna and octopus. For oysters, be prepared to queue for it while 2 kitchen help frantically shuck them in front of you and then stall for time while attempting to retrieve a new batch. The pizza was just a hard piece of bread topped with dry chewy hard cheese. We didn't finish this.The chilli crab was drenched in a rather excellent gravy but the shell was not cracked in advance so don't forget to get the nutcrackers in advance. The grilled station was also quite alright, offering grilled salmon head, shishamo and on the same table, was satay. The satay was pretty alright. Decently marinated but it didn't have the smokey flavour if you grill it over a proper charcoal fire. This was accompanied by dry cubes of ketupat, some onions that made us question its freshness. The gravy here was pretty good! In fact, this satay gravy was abt the few things I actually enjoyed here. Drench everything with satay gravy like I did and it was pretty enjoyable!Would I return? No way. There are many other restaurants offering similar buffet spreads in much better embience.
2
We booked a table for 6 and yes, it is cheap and value for money but you do get what you pay for.The quality of food was mediocre and widely spaced out to give it the illusion of quantity.we were given a table in ths corner near the kitchen and it was really warm and noisy. I don't recommend this for gatherings that you want to chat and catch up qith friends.Personally, this place garners a big "Meh" from me. Its cheap but noisy and what bothers me most is that they'd deliberately make you wait for your food so thst you'll feel full a lot faster. That disguised as food being prepared on the spot. Beware
3
We went there to during our CNY dinner and good thing we made reservations because the place was packed. we purposely went there an hour early before dinner starts but we were already on queue. They have 2 queues, one for with reservation, another for walk-ins, I recommend you make reservations as this place is quite affordable and have lots of patrons. The spread was pretty good, I was quite impressed with their Japanese spread as well as the oyster and seafood selection... no lobster here though :)Drinks are free-flow so its a good plus but when we went there, their soda dispenser seems to be not properly set up. It lacked gas and tasted weird. Overall, the spread was pretty good for the price paid. They have live stations, which is my personal favorite; my friends did enjoy their seafood spread; the desert section is actually just ok; the satay and local section was a hit that you have to wait on queue to get one; the place was a bit cramped though but hey we paid an inexpensive amount so what would you expect ^_^... the ambiance is ok, place is clean, so yep... its not a rip off.. still worth it.. I couldn't stress more on reservations, please make one

This restaurant is at the basement of Raffles Place and is great for tourists like myself who wish to try different Singaporean food.Went there on a weekend lunch and there were crabs, crayfish, prawns and sashimi. Not bad for the price.Only complaint is the queue was a little too long. I guess you always have to wait for good things
3
Serves a large variety of food & for the price paid, is considered a bargain compared to many similar restaurants in Singapore. Staff keeps the food amply supplied at this self service restaurant. However, tastes & quality is average. The location is also very convenient. My only complaint was the sashimi chef cutting the fish using a blunt knife - the tuna had the texture of sawdust on the tongue
3
Was there for lunch buffet. Note oyster and crab only available for dinner. Buffet spread and environment is ok bad but don't expect hotel settings. The baked fish-head is nice. Food quality nothing to shout about. Air con can be quite warm.Pricing is affordable.http://www.buffettown.com.sg/pricing.htm
4
A large restaurant in the beautiful Raffles Mall. It has a large selection of nicely presented dishes to chose from. All self service but staff are about to help. The seafood selection was really good. No wines but beers available. The dishes are kept topped up really well.Perfect for a quick lunch in pleasant surroundings
4
Went there for dinner and the spread was good especially when they serve fresh oyster. If you like seafood then this will be the right choice as they have more seafood spread. They have chill crab section also but the crab was so so. Their tempura section was not bad. Overall experience is good

Singapore is a cosmopolitan metropolis, with around 5.5 million people living in the little red dot (of which approx. 3 million are locals) and with a landmass of only 277 square miles (that's almost half the size of the county of Greater Manchester in the UK) it's a pretty densely populated place. This makes Singapore the third most densely populated country on the planet, this provides a fertile multicultural environment; especially for food. As a hub of Asia Pacific, you can find any number of Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean, Malaysian, Filipino, Thai, Indonesian, Indian and Australian restaurants to tickle your taste buds. Also, with the island being approximately half populated by foreigners there is a huge inter-continental cuisine footprint here. You can find an array of authentic Spanish, Italian, Mexican, French, German, Mediterranean, American, British and African food here; the list continues. With this environment, and a very high GDP per capita, competition amongst the restaurants is very high. Rabid competition drives differentiation and this really benefits the resident or traveller to this little island. The food here is simply fantastic.The law of averages however, as with anywhere, is prevalent here. My girlfriends extended family were visiting from mainland China so 7 of us decided to go. The queue to get in was pretty severe, especially for a Sunday evening, an early sign of a good restaurant? It's not the cheapest Buffet I've visited in Singapore at around 50 dollars per head. As we entered we struggled to find seats, it was so busy, another sign of a great restaurant. After we got seats we were told the aircon was broken, so backup Maxichill fans had been brought in, they were insufficient and one was placed right next to our table; pretty loud. After a few sighs, everyone was hungry so we got up and explored the selection. Sushi, pizza, pasta, local cuisine and an array of deserts are available here - not a fantastic selection if I'm brutally honest. Ok, now the most important part - the food. Every dish I had was terrible, I tried the Beef Stew which was flavourless and had a weird gritty texture. I tried the seafood aglio e olio, which would have made an Italian cry with disappointment. I waited almost 15 minutes in a queue inside the buffet for chicken satay; it turned out to be pathetic. I then queued for another almost 15 minute stint for sushi which was just Ok. After leaving more than 3/4 of each dish I went for soup, they had a french onion soup that tasted like thin gravy. In addition, all of the dishes I tried with the exception of the satay and sushi, were lukewarm at best. My girlfriend had one plate of food, of which she left half. In Summary, other than the fact you can eat yourself silly here this place is really too busy, overpriced, and has sub-standard food; really very poor.Good points: As much as you can eat, free refills on soda, ice cream and fruit.Areas for improvement: Food quality, Food taste, Food temperature, Air Conditioning, Service, product availability, price, variety

Went there for lunch. The place is spacious but the spread is not that much. Very limited choice of dessert/ cakes. The Chinese dishes are slightly more salty.
At the price around $30/pax after taxes, it doesn't really worth it.
3
service so-so. feels kind of over-priced. if you ain't a seafood lover, you would be wasting your money heading down especially on a weekend (dinner). Nothing much to rave about. Other than seafood like oysters and prawns.. the others are pretty normal tasting.
4
We came here for lunch and I was impressed by how often they were bringing out food. There was also a lot of seafood to pick from. Also drinks were included.
4
This buffet restaurant need more than 1 week reservations as the online reservations easily full or else you're willing to Q for 1 hour especially on weekends. We've been here many times together with friends. It's value for money as we love eating the oysters, fresh prawns, rock lobsters & sushi
3
If not for the fact that service charge is added to the bill, I would not have tipped.Other than being shown to my seat, service was non-existent during the entire meal.I was there for lunch. There was not much crowd, and yet no one cleared the plates.Food variety was good, but the seafood was not fresh.Crayfish was not fresh, the prawns tasted bland.Hot food was lukewarm.The standard has definitely dropped since my last visit last year
2
Booked for 12 pax on Aug 2 for family, celebrating our son who turned 1. Very crowded. No service staff to clear our plates the whole night, piling up....my brother-in-law kept clearing our plates on our behalf. It was like "return your own tray" in a food court. My brother was okay about it. :- ) Long queue for the sashimi and fresh sea food section. Oysters tasted salty instead of fresh! Not enough saucer for the sashimi dip...people were using bowl. So did we. LOL.Chilli crab- thrice our family went to that section, none of us manage to get any. Seem like they did not have enough to cater to a Saturday crowd. Empty plastic cups were lying around the drink section. I was unsure which were the clean ones actually.It was not our first visit. We visited twice before but we gonna give a miss in the future. The first 2 visits were lunch and this dinner celebration .... will be our las

Was there with 2 friends on Friday, 22 August 2014 for dinner. The selection of cuisine is pretty limited and all tasted the same - salty.First dining experience: the staff at the entrance was not very customer service orientated but I attributed that she is young and inexperienced. She showed us to our table after we have made payment. (The payment policy in this organisation is that we are required to pay before we get to even go into the restaurant and I seemed to know why after the night went on).My entire dining experience was ruined after I scalded myself with the hot tempura sauce half way through my dinner. I went up to the service staff for first aid assistance. But unfortunately, he did not seemed to understand English and instead kept smiling at me. I showed him my scalded hand and gesture for the first aid but instead he took some serviettes. I had no choice but to tell him to get his Manager to look for me.It took some time before the Manager came and when I requested for first aid, this Manager got another Manager to come to speak to me. I had to repeat myself all over again and to my horror, I was left seating with no one coming to my aid. I gave up waiting and walked to the office to look for the first aid box with another Manager (third person). I cannot believe this restaurant has an ill-equipped first aid box. I told the Manager to update the box immediately while I have my wound washed in the toilet.I thought back and guess that the only reason for the delay to attend to my injury by the entire team was because they all knew their first aid box is not equipped and my second guess is that they thought I was out to have a free meal. For the record, no compensation whatsoever was offered despite what they have put me through and since I have already paid, they just didn't bother. The only consolation was that the head chef learned about my injusry and came forth to apologise to me and checked on me twice after I have applied the burn solution.I will definitely not recommend anyone to dine here and will definitely not go back there again

We booked ahead knowing this place gets busy. We weren't wrong! We arrived at 6:30pm and by 7pm, it was packed! I didn't try any of the western food, except the seafood. The seafood was fresh and was continually replenished through the evening. A highlight was the chilli crab. Tasty satay, sashimi, sushi, laksa, tempura vegetables, noodles, endless soft drink, tea and coffee and yummy desserts. A good way to try some traditional Singapore food all under the one roof. Good to see mostly locals dining here so you know the food is good
1
This is my third visit after a 3 yrs break, seems business are good but service sucks. I arrive at around 6pm, there is a quene outside so as usual i join the quene only to found out the quene are for reservations. I was chase to the side where i found a shorter quene and read a sign indicate walkin 615. I tell myself do i need to wait till 615 even no more on reservations quene? The wait were short, soon our turn to pay and in. While i was paying, i was told i am not allow to change my table. I find it puzzle and found later why. I think i am earlier so could have most of the food. Indeed no quene and could have as much as i like . Not full around my table and most of the seat. Then i found out the heat build up and seems hot. Now i know why i was told cannot change table. Also heard other guest asking the same question and was reply No. Seems if you are early, you will be penalizes and have to be force to sit at the area when the ventilation are bad. Try most of the food, most are average but they have a wide range. Will give this place a miss, there are more better buffet
3
We celebrated a birthday at buffet town. You pay upfront before entering. Average cost about $50per pax. Food we enjoyed were the fresh chilled prawns, oysters, sashimi and Indonesian style chicken satay. The selection at the western dishes counter was quite pathetic. The chinese cooked dishes had dory fish fillets, pork and broccoli that were rather bland. The tempura was a bit too oily. The hits at the desserts were a refreshing yuzu cake, crepes and green tea ice cream. The misses include cream puffs, waffles and tarts. The service was good overall with a particular young waitress smiling and clearing plates quite quickly. For the price, it was ok but with the selection and food quality, I won't be coming back again in a long while.
1
Apart from the satay and soft drink, I do not see any quality foods from them. The serving staff are always in black face, seem we are begging food from them. I really didn't see any sincerity from them.
3
This place seems to be extremely popular, with queues started forming even 45 mins before the restaurant opens for lunch and dinner. With all the hype, I would expect good quality food. But honestly, don't expect too much out of it.
3
liked the fresh sashimi and oyters and the dessert counter.
make reservation or prepare to q quite long.
dislike ugly diners...
3
To be honest, I believe that the reason this place has plenty of good reviews is probably the seafood. Seafood in sufficient quantity will make any buffet place look like a good deal. If you discount the seafood, this place is then just mediocre.It is indeed large, but I was disappointed that such a large space was not better utilised. They could have easily added another 100% variety of dishes. Yes, I do mean that I feel that the variety was not enough for the space they had. This was the first buffet that I have been to, where my first round ended up with only 3 dishes on my plate. One being roasted potatoes (not smart to start a buffet with potatoes I know but choices were limited.), Ayam penyet (slightly dry tasting) and the last being Pork in Char Siew Sauce (dry and tough!)I liked the fact that they had a tea and coffee counter where the hot drink is prepared for you. And there are quite a few dishes that are prepared only when you order, ensuring that the item is hot, and not been left out sitting. The desserts section was quite ok. They had 6 flavours of ice cream, but since almost everyone ends up having desserts at about the same time, it can be quite a queue! They also some other cakes and even herbal jelly which was not of the watered down variety.All in all, I would say that this is a buffet for seafood lovers as the seafood is what makes it worthwhile for the amount of money paid. If you are not a seafood fan, you might do better to look elsewhere to better spend your $$$
4
I love buffets, this restaurant is huge in size. it can seats a few hundred of people. I like the huge spread, These are some of the spread in the Cold section. It has some of my favourite, Salmon sashimi, cold prawns. Salads.Cray Fish and many more. simply irresistable. the ambience is good, staff are very efficient in clearing your plates. Friendly.
4
came here for lunch (11am-3pm) on a weekday (~$31/pp). tons of food to select from!! (except for chili crab & lobsters). the food selection range varies from east to west: salad, sushi, stir fried veges, curries, pizza, roasts, grilled, hot pots, soups, drinks, desserts. pretty good value
5
Went to Buffet Town with a couple of friends just for a good dinner out.. Given the reviews and the comments given by some friends, I was hesitant at first to make this reservation but did it no doubt and didn't regret doing so.. Had a good table, good fresh, tasty food, service was good, everything went well & we all were full from the food and laughter..Surely will come here again.. Recommended.
5
Visited this place with my relatives & friends from China in DEC 2013 , lots of varieties to choose .. all the foods are fresh & delicious especially their oysters ... unlike other restaurants that I visited they do not restrict how many oysters you can take ... this is surely a good news for those oyster fans as you do not need to re-queue again for the oysters ...

After a few weeks in Europe recently, we had a stop-over in Singapore at Swissotel the Stamford. On the second last day, we stumbled upon this marvellous restaurant in the same building as The Stamford - the maÃ®tre de showed us what they had on offer and we quickly fell in love with their food. Unfortunately, we only had time to visit a second time before we had to fly home to Brisbane. We compliment them on the variety and quality of the food and on their service. Their friendly staff promptly attended to our needs.Further, the cleanliness of their city and the friendliness of their citizens impressed us more than any other places we had visited in Europe over the previous four weeks. We are now planning to re-visit Singapore and have already started to recommend the city, including this restaurant to our many friends. We are definitely eating there again!

We had all came to for a birthday celebration and was there at around 6 plus on Thursday, so it wasn't exactly full. I have made a reservation before that so waiting time was no issue. However, what shocked me excatly was the bad attitude and service of a particular manager name Dennis. As all 3 of us were seated in an awkward table and position, we decide it will be good that we can ask for a change as the restaurant wasn't full at all.. one of the waiter came to us and mention that he can't do anything to the change. .which then after the manager came. He, dennis, then started talking to us like a kid. He never let us finished our explanation and yet started his own rude long explanation of his. First he mention to us bluntly if we know the meaning of reservation. .if not, we can check on the meaning of it in a dictionary. .we were clearly humiliated as there was no intention of us pointing on any fault or even an heated argument. . If he as a manager can't do anything on it, he can always explain to us nicely and not in such an unreasonable manner. It's not as if we can't handle rejection to our request! Seriously speaking. .this will be the last time we will be turning up in the restaurant again. Food was okay but if even a simple basic manner and courtesy of a manager was not there, I see no point in coming back. I would urge that the restaurant would give some service training to their employees, as I could see very little of them wearing a smile at all too.
4
After my initial visit to this plc, i cannot wait to go back again. There r so much varieties of food for selection which is a one-stop for people who love food of various nationalities ie japanese, international, local etc.
5
Been there with group of colleagues... Quite crowded even on weekday. The food was nice, u will find many choices from Asian to Western plus local desserts.. It's worth money:-)

Yesterday was my mom’s birthday, and we all decided to celebrate it at Raffle City Buffet Town and we already made a reservation. We are very disappointed with the service. This was my first time to visit this restaurant and we have no idea which table location is good or bad. We have been addressed to the table which is very oily and smoky. I have elderly and children with me so I tried to request a change to another table to one service person. Dennis attended us, but I was so surprised that when we asked to change table, he replied to me that when they reserved the table to me they have no idea where is it located in a very rude manner and he told us that all table is fully booked. I have been many other restaurants before what I understand is you can still take in walk-in customers. Yes they are all under reservation but a lot of empty tables. This made me feel that I don't want to step in this restaurant again. Food was average, service is bad and therefore I will not eat and suggest this restaurant
3
The buffet spread was quite good, with quite a good mix of selection. Japanese, western, asian, dessert, free flow of drinks, etc, etc..However, I would say that the food taste rather average. When I was there, I thought the cabonara pasta and cream of mushroom was way too watery, and the satay was a little burnt. Service was quite on the mark though, they clear the plates pretty fast. At around S$30 per person for lunch, I would say it's worth it if you don't mind a bit of everything of some average tasting food
5
This is our first visit to this restaurant. My sister in-law highly recommended this place because of the fresh seafood available... See the photos yourself... They are worth a thousand words. Oysters, green-lid mussels, live prawns, slippers lobsters, Japanese tempura, sashimi, sushi, Singapore laksa, freshly brewed coffee / tea, freshly homemade soya bean drink (no preservatives) etc... the list goes on...I WILL BE BACK..
4
Thanks to the operators of Buffet Town in providing such wide variety of food selection in the dinner menu. There are meat, chicken, seafood, local delights, sushi, Chinese, Italian and lots of desserts. It even offer themed selection like Nonya selection. Service is good where waiters is readily around to dispose off the used plates. Not bad of a choice for buffet meal
5
This is a typical Singapore innovative concept Buffet.There are so many choices of food with some freshly cooked in front of you.Unlike other buffets generally the food was hot and fresh.They had a Thai Food theme promotion and like everything else it was goooood.The advertised price was what you pay No unexpected surprise charges for drinks etc like other buffets.Try it you will be amazed 
3
Having paid a $48+ dinner, I was very underwhelmed. I felt like the food was never completely fresh and the time waiting in line before dinner was not worth it at all. The food tended to be luke warm or just cold. To add to it the lines were very long and some people didn't understand the concept. I don't think I would ever eat dinner there again. Maybe go back to see how lunch is different
4
A very good selection of local and international food. The seafood is not so fresh but the other dishes are cooked to perfection. There is everything from local dishes to Pizza to roast beef and a great selection of desserts. There is also a free flow of soft and hot drinks. There is a kids area where you can dine and the kids can play indoor basketball. However, I have to be honest that in that area I noticed a cockroach that put us off our dinner. Apart from that the buffet was excellent. It can get very busy, therefore reservations are recommended
3
we were attracted by the seafood that was on offer. In the event the chilli crabs were disappointing and virtualy impossible to eat cleanly. It was very busy and not a very restful dinig experience. The cost was not cheap about £49 for 2 in English money and that was without any beer or wine. Water and soft drinks were included
5
A place all travellers should go to ...have never seen so much food you will never go away hungry .....
4
My partner and i came across this buffet restaurant in Singapore City. We were strolling in a very humid and hot Singapore and went to chance upon Raffles City mall food court. It was a Friday lunch and average crowd. We went in and found huge variety of international food ! Seafood, Japanese, Italian, grilled meat and fish, salads, etc. Dessert station with heaps of sweets and ice creams :) There were drinking station as well for choices of softdrinks, juices and hot drinks. We were so starving and we thought we would be able to try them all but we surrendered to a great cuppa in the end. I am used to buffet resto in Sydney but this one is worth another visit. It was worth the price. Nice lunch experience indeed
4
A very good range of food. So big a range that I never finish trying everything. Quality of food I would consider above average. My only complaint is the sashimi is not as good as some of those I tried in other buffets. There's the seafood section, salad section, sashimi section, pizza, pasta, nonya, BBQ, teppanyaki, soup, cooked food and dessert sections. For the pricing, I enjoyed it.
3
Being a buffet meal, you cannot expect everything to be of good quality in terms of taste. Buffet Town is priced very reasonably for its variety of cuisines offered, from Japanese to italian and even local cuisines. I would go after the seafood selections such as the oysters and crayfish as well as the Japanese sushi & sashimi selection. Other than these 2 types of cuisines, the rest of the food was not fantastic but adequate enough. The dessert was quite a disappointment as some of the cakes were extremely hard and dry.Overall, Buffet Town's attractive pricing and variety of cuisines offered makes it one of the most crowded restaurants in Raffles City, but do not let the crowd affect your opinion on the food offered
3
For $30+ SGD this buffet is quite good value. It contains a reasonable selection of dishes from around Asia (Japanese, Thai, Chinese) and a few random European dishes. Drinks are also included in the price, so for value for money the buffet is not bad. However thinking back to the buffet now, most of the dishes were unmemorable and not the highest quality. Your local Singapore hocka center has equivalent quality food for many of the dishes presented. The service / staff training was also not very good, with the lady on the till having no clue how to use the credit card machine (took 5 minutes to process a card) and half-way through the buffet another server dropping 20 plates or so on the floor; no smiles either. Compared to an international 5* buffet, this buffet pales in comparison in service, quality, attention to detail and ability to customize food; all of which would be expected in a 5* hotel chain such as Movenpick for not a significantly higher international price
3
Most Singaporeans are fastidious about their food and 'lousy' grade foodstalls/restaurants will not survive as they need high turnover to pay their high rentals. How do you then rate a good buffet from a so so one ? answer: variety and more variety and makes you want 2nd helpings.Answers: yes, there have variety from japanese (sushi/tempura) to seafood (prawns, mussels, but dont expect oysters at lunchtime or lobsters (substituted by small crayfish/slipper lobsters).You can find local delicacies like satay, hainam chicken rice, curry laksa).Don t expect the spread of a 5 star hotel's buffet for $30+ dollar for lunch and i can fairly said it s above average but not memorable.Coffee is atrocious but you cannot expect gourmet coffee for the price you pay. I will not come back if i can go to buffets at 4/5 star hotels

We are here 4th times for our corporate bonding dinner.The food quality was gone down compares with our few visits. The western pasta counter chef is not friendly at all. Quality of the ice cream also dropped and too soft. I guess it was melted.But the sushi counter and the chef was fantastic! Since the one market by chef wan, another option bonding place for us and there have more main course those the seafood choice is not compete here!Hopefully our next visit could have more surprises and differences for our mouth eatery satisfaction

There was a long queue for walk-ins so I was glad my friends made reservations in advance. got ushered to our seats and the seating area was a little tight as it was in very close proximity with other tables. But some tables have more space, for e.g. what i heard was the Sumo area and the Glass area, these 2 areas seemed more spacious and were a little isolated away from other tables.Food was great. Wide variety and fresh seafood every day, though different items on the menu every day. Had Wagyu Beef on my day of visit (Friday) but it didn't taste that well. Fresh oysters were good, alongside the frankfurters and other delights.I, however, was personally impressed by the service of the crew and especially loved the service of the one guy in suit (which I presumed to be the Manager). I went over to the Soya Bean Drink area and was waiting for the crew to serve me and the Manager came over and ask me politely if there was anyone attending to me. I said no and he got the attention of the crew immediately. He was meticulous to the other details as well. It's one of the best service I had received

A mega buffet restaurant with a wide choice and variety of international cuisine. Price includes the buffet spread, dessert and coffee/tea/cold beverages which is value for money. The Japanese food section is OK, except for the Sashimi spread which needs to be better presented and re-plated from time to time as the big crowd during lunch hour keep messing up the Sashimi and Sushi display

The buffet has a lavish spread located conveniently beside hotels like swissotel and fairmont . The dessert section is ok . Unlimited drinks . The food quality though is average , some dishes like the pizza was good . Made for local taste i suppose
