I can't even find a dish that disappoint me.. truly a food gem is Redhill area! Low profile dimsum restaurant! Love the variety price wise is reasonable good for afternoon tea and business lunch! Service is good too fast and clean restaurant.

This traditional Cantonese restaurant in an old neighbourhood has retained its charm, continuing to serve good quality dishes at very reasonable prices. Good for dim sum, family celebrations or even to host foreign visitors in a lesser-known part of Singapore.

Simply because I have always dined here and always given good reviews for the food, reasonably priced with good quality foodThis year the CNY reunion dinner done at the restaurant left a really bad taste in my mouth- restaurant tried on capitalise on the festivities and arrange 3 sessions of dinner, sittings start from5-6.306-8.309-10.30It was absolutely chaotic, and my Mom was panicking as the restaurant said if we don’t turn ip on time, its too bad for us...- in the frenzy with limited staff, I was shocked when the dishes start arriving.The sharks fin soup was absolutely tasteless with a hint of bicarbonate soda. The broth was tasteless and the combination was so bad I couldn’t take another bite.I had to ask for the manager and invite him to a bowl of the sharks fin so as to make him understand. He said oh, they forgot the gravy and scooped lots of gravy into our bowlsNow there is some taste but the strong metallic taste of the sharks fin is still unbearable! Never in my life I have tasted anything like this!- the roasted pork and steamed fish saved the night, was really good and all of us enjoyed!- the broccoli and scallops with mushroom dishes were way too salty! - the last main was fried rice with shrimps and ham...it was a disaster, truly bland, rice is hard and many parts were burnt! And I became the waitressing my table, I ran up n down to find clean plates, clean bowls, clean cutleries...The desserts were only so so for the ice cream in pomelo sago but it’s nice they served the new year cake with sesame biscuitsIn short, Such a bad bad experience for close to $1000! Ziran you should never forgo your focus and commitment to good quality food in place of squeezing 3 seatings to earn more monies, unless you can maintain the quality of food and truly handle the volume of business

The rare morning drizzle and breeze in tropical Singapore has made the 3-min sheltered walk from Redhill MRT to Zi Yean no longer drudgery but rather a relaxing trip. The small while tiles on the wall and the slightly cramped space really reminded me of the old Hong Kong style-the best for a dim sum feast.Overall: Great Dim sum! The best part is that they are not stingy on the ingredients at all! For prawn dumplings, there are literally three fresh and nicely steamed prawn inside! Even for siew mai there’s a small prawn in! Same goes for cheong fun, giving you a mouthful of delight.My favorites: Siew mai: fresh and soft with a prawn at the bottom. Not so heavy seasoned so you can enjoy the full body of a siew mai without feeling thirsty afterwardsBlack bean pork rib: the portion is huge with quite some small ribs which come with few bones! The best part is instead of using yam, pumpkin was put in at the bottom which give the ribs a special aroma. The less dry pumpkin also makes the rib a bit more moist, allowing the full contact with your taste buds, hence maximizing the impact of the taste.Area for improvement: Some of the dim sum could be more seasoned. The skin of prawn dumplings is a little too thick.Price: $2.5 dollars for every single dim sum if you check the bill before 11am! Such value for money! Overall great dim sum with great friends as company! Highly recommend!

Two friends came for lunch as t was close to workplace. Wow, discreet location, decent ambience, excellent service and just about the best dim sum I've had in Singapore in ages.Perfect har gow, wonderful egg yolk buns. Beef balls like I haven't had in so long, light, flavorful with that touch of citrus peel. Great noodles, pleasant owner and staff.The best spinach with 3 egg broth too.I'll be back

I was there for dim sum with colleagues on a Friday. Only 2 tables were occupied.The prawn rice rolls was packed fresh prawns, fantastic. Char siew buns were served hot, not bad too. The portion of fried prawn in beancurd skin was considered generous. The fried pumpkin cake with roast meat, fried prawn dumpling and minced pork noodles were average.Service was excellent. Will be sure to return for affordable dim sum

I have been here wih family twice.Once for dim sum only.Second time for dinner plus dim sum dishes.I like the roast suckling pig though it is more expensive than other restaurants. The skin is crispy and the meat is soft.The Peking duck is quite good too.Both of these dishes need to be pre ordered. Their dim sum is authentic HK style. Reasonable price for the quality you get.The only 2 dimsum dishes I will not order again are custard pau (liu sar pau) and steamed rice rolls ( the skin of the rice rolls were thick and not smooth)Service is acceptable, though not the best

This review is for their cafe next to the restaurant. Location is a 15 minutes walk from Redhill MRT station, in block 56, at the ground level. Heartland cafes like this one are fast disappearing where dim sum and congee are served from 8am onwards. Delighted to know all items are handmade, as we can taste the freshness. Other zhe-char dishes are available at reasonable prices. Great value for money

Expensive & staff poor customer service attitude: 1. Rushing us to take their recommended dishes, when ask for others dishes show unhappy face.2. After taking order ask how many dishes have we ordered don't bother to read back. 3. Drunken prawn end up like dry steam prawn, with no gravy or soup

I've been going to this restaurant since I was a child in the 80s. Theirs was always good traditional Cantonese cuisine. I left Singapore in the 2006 and returned recently to discover that they are still in business, having moved previously from Stirling Road to Redhill.The restaurant has expanded but the food quality has not improved, if not worse. What was most disappointing is the service. Perhaps I should say there was minimal. One middle aged waitress was just standing around, doing nothing. One Chinese girl was working very hard to serve but obviously could not handle. The waiter who took our order looked like he was having a really hard day, with a face that was sullen.We ordered too much food and when we told them to pack for takeaway, they asked for a $1 surcharge!The cashier lady, presumably looking like the lady boss, offered no greetings at all.Food quality was average, despite all these years.Overall an experience that makes one think twice about going back

A good chef never changes his spots! Still reliable after all these years. Really good Cantonese cuisine to be had without breaking the bank.

The dim sum are pretty decent however not much variety was being offered. The porridge is kind of disappointing whilst the fried brocoli was fresh. Overall it is a decent place if you are not very particular on ambience and service.

This traditional restaurant reminds me of the large restaurants back in 70's - 90's. We went there to celebrate my mom's 72nd birthday. The deco is minimal but the food is good. The roasted suckling pig , the ribs, the bamboo clam, the steamed rock oysters are all very delicious. However, the steamed fish is not that great. Service is friendly. I definitely recommend for good ole family gathering who appreciate Cantonese food

Had always known this restaurant to be a seafood restaurant until my friend brought me there for dim sum.Food wise, I think is reasonable for dim sum in terms of taste and pricing. But what I found to be particularly value for money is the beef noodle. Think it cost only $3.80 but is one full portion. Service wise is really bad. If you want a quiet place for dim sum, this place would work. Especially if you do not need service.

It was past 9pm and we didn't have much of an appetite -we just wanted some simple bites for a late dinner.We usually ate at their non air-con restaurant at the corner. It was closed on Monday night so we 'settled' for their fancy aircon full service restaurant a few doors away.There were 3 menus to choose from: a 4-5 star restaurant menu, a menu by per pax ($19.90 if I remember correctly) and a $9.90 per dish menu.We were forewarned that the $9.90 per dish portion was very small, just enough for 2 persons. And indeed the portions were very small. We were quite happy with all the 5 dishes we ordered as they were quite well prepared and tasted nice - sweet sour chicken (5/5), prawns with eggs (4/5) note: only 5 small/medium size prawns) braised pork (3/5); abalone mushrooms on spinach (4/5) and brinjal on minced pork(3/5).Overall a good dinner experience made better by good company

Three of us ordered prawn paste chicken, bean curd skin prawn, hot plate bean curd andsliced fish with hot sauce.The prawn paste chicken was blend and the bean curd skin was flaky and not solid bean skin. The other two dishes were just ok.Previously when the old restaurant was at Stirling road it was really very good. I think the current owners has left the Chefs unsupervise

This resultant looks like ordinary Resturant yet the taste is goodThe chef was from Hong Kong many years back. Serving great Cantonese cruise at affordable rate. The staff are nice and friendly There is a choice of having dinner at air conditioned area or outdoor. Recommend to try steam fish and salted egg shrimp

The barbecue honey pork chop was great so was the muy Choi chicken. The dim sum I'm sorry to say was quite ordinary The service was less than ordinary. The waiter when asked if the toilets - which incidentally are a bit away from the restaurant - were clean replied "what do you expect, it's a toilet'

Everyone loves the mui cai chicken & the deep fried prawn wrapped with beancurd. Other zi char dishers are moderate. This place its like a hidden jam, usually on weekdays not crowded where you will get better service and attention from the servers.I was there recently over the SG 50 weekend, it was very crowded, taste of food was not up to the usual standard. The service was bad, servers were rude due to the pressure during the dinner rush time. Kitchen was chaos, our 6 types of cold platter supposedly to arrive 1st course, it became our last dish. And when we asked, the server says that some of the items on the platter needed time to cook. ...Hello!! The server should have informed us before ordering!

Went there for a simple birthday celebration. It is a simply furnished Chinese restaurant that charges hawker pricing. We had: - six small abalones;- fried noodles with duck and mushroom- veggies with mushroom - crab meat with egg - preserved vegetables and whole duck - deep fried bean curd - pig trotter- and dessert (yam paste, osmanthus jelly, coconut and mango jelly, black sesame paste, and mango sago -- in single serving to share) The bill came up to ard 180 dollars in all. The must try dish is the preserved veg (Mui cai) with whole chicken. It has a nice fermented taste and smell which is very fragrant. All in all, will recommend the place!

I have been to the restaurant many times for Dim Sum. My family find it of good value and reasonably priced. It has different sections for different prices - aircon and non-aircon. I definitely recommend it for Dim Sum lovers.

Interesting food and good service except that the toilet is horrible. The chicken dish is nice and the signature dish is also the fried prawn. The sesame paste dessert is very good, with wolfberry and other stuff that you see in other restaurant.
4
Reasonable pricing, slightly more expensive than Zi char. However has a great variety of ala carte menu items and cosy homey atmosphere. Ideal for small families celebrations.

Fantastic cantonese food offered by HK chef...absolutely loved the venision....have to try....best venison I've tasted in singapore! Extremely tender and juicy! Tucked away in a slightly shabby housing estate so can be bit difficult to find...slightly feel insecure about parking in the area.

Everything is cheap and good - so long as you don't order a live fish

This is a Singapore heartland restaurant that also caters 2 weddings! Place is sizeable but don't expect much ambience. However, food has proved since we last ate there a few years back. Convenient and can easily accommodate walk-ins. We were there on a Sunday afternoon after a tiring Chengbeng (yearly prayers n visits to columbariums). Steamed sea bass, cereal prawns and of course not forgetting the stewed chicken with preserved vegetables! Also had dim sum. Good value for a Sunday promotion at the restaurant!

We went to this restaurant on 03 Jan 2014. Despite sitting in the air con area where we are charged more, the service is so terrible for such average food and the bill came up to over $400 and we did not even order the expensive dishes! The waiter keep persuading us to take the set menu instead of the ala carte dishes as it would be serve faster. So does it mean that we do not have the priority despite coming earlier than those tables who order the set menus which are of course more exp? In the end the food came within 10 mins of us placing order. This shows that the waiter is just trying to con us into ordering the more exp dishes. We decided to order a second round of food but the waiter claim that it would take a while. We told them that it is ok. But after the first dish came, the second additional dish never appeared. Checking with the waiter he claim we never order. How could that be possible if we had order both dishes together? All the waiters and waitress here are extremely rude with attitude issues. The food is definitely not worth the price. We had much better food and service at another nearby zhi char store and at a much lower price! Even restaurant prices are cheaper and much better food quality! Will never come here again

I went to Zi Yean for a yum cha lunch. We sat in the open air area (there is an air-conditioned section to the restaurant too).We had the usual range of yum cha goodies as well as a bowl of chicken and century egg congee. The food was pretty decent all round. The congee was excellent but the xiao long bao was ordinary. There was just no soup in them!Overall though, a satisfying meal. Price was unbelievable compared to home in Australia. The meal for two of us cost not much more than $20 AUD

This is our go to place for dim sum at an early hour.Location is not the most salubrious, but for the price you pay, you really can't complain. Dim sum quality is very decent, even good. You can't compare it with hotel quality, but again, for the price you pay and the frequent promotional prices, you really can't complain. For lunch, a good deal would be the one dish meals- rice topped with sweet and sour fish or black pepper beef etc. If you order other a la carte dishes like meat or fish, be prepared to pay.

Been here a number of times. On this occasion, I took a large group of people here for Dim Sum. Food was good, service was not.While waiting for the rest of my party, staff kept trying to encourage me to take a table in the air conditioned, more expensive area.After eating, I went to the counter to pay my bill using my visa. The hostess, for lack of a better word, was a rude, make up encrusted, Tammy Faye like witch with a mouth full of food that she was chomping on with an open mouth all the while she was talking.She told me I had to pay cash, but I said I was not carrying cash. She told me to wlak to the MRT to get some. I said no, as I had mobility issues. She said they do not take CC's. I said you did so on previous occasions. she told me to leave the card on the counter and she will get to it when she was ready, and that I would be charged an additional 7% as a processing fee. Sounds to me that it's more like the tax they would have to collect because they would have to declare the sale.Very sad

Despite it's humble location in the neighbourhood HDB, the dim sum Canotonese style zi cha are decent comfort food. I will recommend theirpan-fried pumpkin cake, home-made tofu, pork rib, three-cup chicken, and steamed garlic bamboo clams.
