We had lunch at this restaurant. I have seen sushis being delivered on a belt in restaurants in Japan, which I found here too!! As the plates pass along, you pick up what you like and click on the Tab attached to your table! Some of the dishes we ordered were Salmon sushis, Beef Katsu and Furai Mori set. We also had a Mango drink and strawberry smoothie. The entrees were very good. The salmon sushis were heavenly!! The tempuras were great!! Nice seating arrangements and the staff were very cordial.It is located on the second level of Bugis Junction Mall
