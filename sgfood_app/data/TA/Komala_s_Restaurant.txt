Vegetable Makhani Curry and veggie Pulao were excellent. Garlic Naan was good too. Good environment and service. I would eat here again.
4
Tried the chapatti set and I liked it. They are also offering western like pasta and burger.
The only downside is that they are not accepting credit cards.

The restaurant ambience is good but pricey. Waiter and waiteress not as attentive. Food was tasty though.

We called by this restaurant for a quick dinner. We ordered one bhindi curry, a dhal, two nan, and one rice. While we thought the food was tasty, it was also very salty.Service was fast, and the waiter evem told us to order less food as we had ordered tio much. We appreciated this

Been there during my visit to Singapore & Had South Indian Dosa & idli the food was delicious and the cost which i saw on the bill was very economical. the restaurant was very busy and was clean.. the meal served was in an authentic South Indian Styl
3
There are few of restaurants with same names and most of those are fast eat type except the one above at upper Dickson Rd. This is vegetarian restaurant although they serve imitation fish and chicken. I just ordered the vegetables and Nan etc. food was good. Service was good.
5
Exquisite Indian cuisine. Such a vast menu it's difficult to know what to choose. The soya options were particularly good - especially the vegetarian 'chicken 65' and 'chicken seekh kebab'. The chilli tofu was nice and spicy too. Very reasonably priced for singapore, and much better than Indian food at more upmarket restaurants. Definitely a must visit on our next trip to singapore.
4
good food, value for money. It's pretty old and has good reputation. South Indian b'fast is good here.
4
While i was in Singapore, I went several times to Komala's restaurant. It serves authentic south indian items like Dosa, Idli, Medu wada etc. The thali is also reasonably priced and delicious.
5
I came here with my family on a weekday. Fast and efficient service. Great authentic Indian vegetarian food. Great price too! What more can I ask for! Love it.
4
Dived in here just off the Serangoon Road, only finding it was verge when sat down. Set meal very authentic South Indian, and all the better for it. And no alcohol🤔.
4
Great food, great ambiance, great staff but not all of them speak English. Great food though. :D It is near Hotel 81 Dickson where we stayed.
5
Was my default stop on a Sunday back in the 90's. It's lost some of its charm with barely any crowd. Still a good option for South Indian vegetarian if you're around. One of those "if you were a 90's kid, you'd remember this" sort of places
4
They stay open until about 23hs, which is a big win in Singapore. Food comes very quickly, and waiter comes to table to ask for other (compared to the branch next to Farrer Park MRT where is more McDonalds style). If you are craving Indian food, quick, late and cheap. Great bang-for-buck, head to Komala's on Upper Dickinson Road. Has an old-restaurant feel. But given the experience, may not even be a bad thing. Waiter were quick and swift to take our orders

Good food but service could be better. I have always enjoyed dining here until today.We ordered two south indian rice meals and an onion masala dosai for lunch and the food was delicious but not spectacular. One of our party did not touch his rice in south indian rice meal and being Asian I asked the server to pack the untouched rice rather than waste food (as its sinful to waste) and I ordered two other breakfast meals to take away for next day. They obliged but did not inform us they have to charge us an extra two dollars for the rice even though we already paid for the south indian meal. The logic was you can eat the rice in the restaurant but cannot pack it away even if you cant finish it. We had eaten our lunch but our guest just did not want to eat his rice but to pack instead of wasting it. It was not logical to pay for the rice which was already included in the bill. Also they could have informed us about their policy instead of simply charging us again,I hope the management will re consider this policy if they want our patronage again as in Little India there are many other choices of excellent vegetarian including Madras Woodlands across the road from them as well as Komalas Villas round the corner, an old favourite both of whom are busier at lunchtime so we went to Komalas which is quieter plus we have not even begun to explore the rest of Little India
4
This particular outlet has the usual favourites and indian Chinese and other options in a very decently kept place on Dickson road. The staff is excellent and attentive and the food is tasty. We had rasam vada sambhar idli and onion Rava dosa and were very happy with all dishes. They also had filter coffee! All in all a nice experience 
4
Every once in a while I get the urge for some authentic Indian vegetarian food. My port of call is always Komala's at Upper Dickson Road. I have been coming here for years and bringing family and friends. Standards have remained high all these years and it stays affordable. The next time you have similar urges, try Komala's - you won't be disappointed
5
This place was like a heaven to us in singapore.You get amazing south indian delicacies with proper taste and is pocket friendly place.
5
This hotel was an excellent choice to taste south indian vegetarian dishes. We had breakfast, lunch as well as dinner out there and found the combination of taste, quality and cost to be very good.
4
Went back to this restaurant 3 times during 2 days in Singapore. If you're after vegetarian food including a variety of mock meats in a meat-heavy city, this is the place to go. Staff are friendly, service is quick and food is tasty.
4
this vegetarian restaurant is situated near little india.It is famous for delisious south indian food and very old and popular
5
Its very nice place and Authentic Indian Food to eat. Try their Meal Thali. It have complete meal and full for One person. There is no scope of complain on Food and Service. Staff also very co-operative.

Was a little hesitant before entering as there were so no crowd. But the food was quite spicy and closer to the real Indian taste. Ordered Garlic Naan set and Paneer fried rice. The 3 curries served with Garlic Naan were good as well. The Badam milk was not so good, could be avoided.Paneer fried rice was the best we had and that really helped us enjoy the whole lunch experience here after shopping in Mustafa.Service - 3/5Food - 4/5Price - okOverall - 4/
1
I asked the waiter for vegan options, he said that all in the menu is "pure vegetarian" but actually the next day we have been told from another waiter that they use cream (cow milk) and maybe even fish oil. Luckily I didn't eat them. The place is quite crowded and even dirty-looking. The biryani-style rice was good and very cheap. Lowest rating is for your dishonesty
4
Another Restaurant I'd recommend, if you visit Singapore. I've some of the nicest memories going there, having Great South Indian food with Lassi. Just don't commit the mistake of ordering the North indian Food there, for U'd be left disappointed and I learnt it the hard way :). This is the good restaurant. One can play his fav songs from Bolly / South Movies from the jukebox by inserting few S$ Bills, while enjoying the food

Komala's restaurant offers a variety of menu choices, north & south Indian as well as Chinese and pizza!! The service was a little slow considering I was one of 2 people there. The food arrived quickly though. There was only 3 small bits of paneer in the paneer tikka masala. It was however filled with massive chunks of peppers and onion. The sauce was really dark and thick, nothing like any other masala I've had. Sadly the flavours weren't that great, it was far spicier than It should have been. Certainly not the masala I was hoping for!The naan bread tasted like it hadn't been cooked in a tandoori oven either, and lacked that lovely charcoal type flavourings. It was all served on plastic plates which was also disappointing. Overall it was a bit of a let down, so I won't be going back. Especially as there are so many other Indian restaurants so close!! No wifi is available.

Had Breakfast and Dinner at this restaurant. Food tasted good. Restaurant is clean. I also saw staff sanitizing the floors and wash basin with hot water. Staff is friendly and courteous. There was a time when staff went an extra mile to seat us downstairs and brought food since upstairs was crowded. I strongly recommend this restaurant
5
A much improved Menu for Vegetarians, a wide choice of dishes,ideal for big parties,food served hot,good location but parking can be a problem at peak times
5
Excellent veg meals. My husband is vegetarian. The food is fresh and tasty. Good service . This is a MUST
4
I visited the restaurant multiple times with my family and i enjoyed eating south indian meals at this place. They have lots of variety in South Indian food and i loved the butter milk there.
4
We stayed at hotel 81 dickson, so this restuarant was very close to our hotel , and also served pure vegetarian food. The food tasted good and the quantity provided was filling.
3
I went there for breakfast. Proper restaurant indoors. Full of locals. Idly with tasty chutney plus Hopi, only 5 dollars. Pleasant service.
4
Komalas is one of the biggest chains of vegetarian hotels in Singapore. I like the food they service. Masala tea is the best among the lot. It's a must try along with Mysore masala dosa.
4
Good pure veg south indian delights. Food was freshly prepared, hot and tasty.Good medu vada's. lassi, mango lassi. and cheap too
4
We found this restaurant when we visited Little India area. We wanted to try the most authentic Indian food and we are glad we found this place. The food was great and just like what we expected.We tried several set menu and all of them didn't disappoint us. The people were also great. They helped us to decide the menu. The price is also quite reasonable. So overall, we are happy and I would recommend this place if you are in the area and wanted to try authentic Indian food

We had a lovely dinner in the bustling Little India area near our hostel. The food was delicious and well-priced. Service was good and friendly. We learnt that there are different definitions of "spicy", but enjoyed the tasty food despite our watering eyes and noses! The area is really cool to walk around in at night and we (two girls) felt 100% safe

After a long morning, we decided to go for the buffet lunch at Komala's - I think that would probably be the most regretful decision I would have ever made. Right from the start, things weren't just right. The starters - something made of mock meat and spring rolls were so cold I think they were leftovers from the day before. The onion pakoda didn't arrive until we asked for it-again cold as if it were from the freezer. The spread was arranged so miserably, with no logic in the order. Salads were ticked away in one corner, soup was in the other corner, starters were somewhere in the middle. Everything was so cold. Mind you, the buffet should have started at around noon, when we entered the restaurant at 1 pm,we were the only people for the buffet spread. Think everyone in the town knew just very well about this. Nothing good could be said about Biryani and the fried rice - yes they were two, none of them lived up to the mark.The paneer in the paneer butter Masala reminded of Natraj Plasto Eraser - you need ultra super strong tooth to chew the rubber.The naan was so dry we actually thought they just said oil to it, instead of adding or showing.Puri was average.I didn't dare to venture into trying the other curries.I think you need special culinary expertise to "sothapify" even curd rice. I think even yesterday's "pazhaya soru" with onion or green chillies would have been better.The only saving grace were the butter milk and the rasgulla.The ice-cream which was displayed as "available upon request" wasn't all that great for the display. I haven't had an ice-cream in my life that tasted sour.For such a pathetic buffet lunch, leave alone $14 per person, I wouldn't dare to go again even if I were dying of hunger and they offered free food

My friend introduced me to this restaurant. It seems to be one of the old restaurant in little India who is serving southindian food. I feel because of so much crowd cleanliness is not up to the mark. Food taste average but better than other restaurants nearby.. if you are carving for south Indian food then good to go here. One suggestion avoding visiting this place during weekends and holidays because it is overcrowded..

As we are on business trip and it is obvious that after work we a bit late for dinner. After searching we finalised to have dinner at this place which was near to our stay. As we enter in restaurant at 10.15 and it was told that we can place order till 10.30. As we have ordered , and waited at table. We saw that staff was murmuring and staring strangely towards us and they served us so rudely even the dish was cold and roti was half cooked. When ask for cold water they say "finished" The person on cash desk criticised aboutUs " Indians " . After I oppose he was fighting with us , So me and my wife got up un- dined . And paid the bill and walked out. What a pity.

Good place for breakfast. Great South Indian Food in Singapore Great meals for 5- 10 SGD. All Douth Indian Meals are available at reasonable price
5
Excellent place for south indian food. Everything in south indian is good.
Courteous staff and clean.
5
When in Little India, we always make sure to drop by. The restaurant brings you the breeze of India, this is one of the closest to what we experienced while living there. I like that I'm not surrounded by hordes of tourists.
4
Was on holiday in Singapore... being a pure veg. it was bit difficult to find good place to eat. but thanks to komala's... we got to eat good indian veg food there. not to expensive. food is good...
4
To have a meal in this restaurant, you need to have patience, but nevertheless this place is worth for Indian food. They serve authentic south indian food and the place is very clean.
3
we came for a late lunch here... jain food has some limtations.. we enjoyed the dosas and uttampams..very well made with jain sambhar and allbut the noodles and vegetable pulav didnt impress.. guess making jain food put them off balance.. noodles had too much soya sauce.. it was like eating mumbai street style chinese.. and pulav though it came aftr a long wait was nothing great..can stick to our good old south indian menu.

I was on a very restricted medical diet when I visited Singapore recently - no fat/oil/frying. When I explained my issue to the sympathetic waitress, rather than being dismissive she went to great pains to make suggestions and advised me she would inform chef about my requirements. In the event, we got a really tasty meal of dhal, vegetables and oil free nan. But what was best is the caring and friendly staff. I also ate here when last in Singapore in 2011 and it looks like I'll just keep coming back. Definitely recommend this place

Stayed at Moon hotel for 4 days and dined at this Restaurant 3 times. Food was nice and reasonably priced. Restaurant is clean and tidy compared to all others around little India. Only issue i had all 3 time we went to dine is was our entree came after mains when your hunger is completely gone!!
4
If you are fed up with chinese taste!! you shd try this place!! it is maintained by indian. Service is good!! when i was in singapore after a long week was fed with food!! then i just gave a try with this hotel!! it was really awesome!! i ll never forget the taste i had!

This place has been around for ages, everyone has their favourite Indian restaurant in Singapore, the food was pretty good although the setting is pretty simple and average, has not been updated, and in order to go to the toilet one has to go through the kitchen out back, not a great ordeal but not fun either plus the toilet room is run down.
