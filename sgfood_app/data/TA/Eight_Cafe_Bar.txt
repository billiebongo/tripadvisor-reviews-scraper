Came with friends whilst visiting Singapore. The menu is very interesting and eclectic. Some great choices. You can choose from the set menu or a la carte. Food is awesome and the service excellent. Bill is a great host. Will definitely return.

Their set lunch is very reasonably priced (SGD 16, about USD 12). It has great choices (chicken, burgers & seafood risotto). It's located just off the famous Keong Saik Road.

Superb casual dining experience found more by accident than design. En-route from the Outram park MRT looking for a quick meal which turned into a very affordable and food that left a wonderful taste on both the palate and the memory. Well worth a visit.

The menu is great with original dishes and quality ingredients. The selection of world wine was good too and prices were affordable given the location.

Was there for a Friday 4 August 2017 dinner to update on upcoming holiday plans. Was there since 1830hrs till late. Wanted to taste something different from the last time, so ordered their Dinner Set (Seafood Vongole) > but not to my liking. Should have stick to the usual. Their Truffle Fries, French Duck Confit never disappoints! Service was prompt and attentive too

Came here today for lunch and opted for one of the sets, consisting of a main and a drink, with dessert for an extra $4. All in we paid $19 each. I had the pork ribs with rice for main, which was really quite tasty but a little on the small side. For dessert the chocolate lava cake which was great. Efficient service also

I learned about this place when I saw some posts of chalkboard arts done personally by the owner in instagram @bill8cafeSituated aling Bukit Pasoh road, this cafe bar is an old shophouse. Accessible to exit H of Outram Park MRT station, this place is tucked away from the noise of the nearby North Bridge Rd. They have weekly specialty items posted on the chalkboard. Happy hour deals in wine by the glass is at $8 (price may have changed from the last time I was here) While Inwas waiting for my friends to arrive, I had the fried calamari which tasted so good that I was able to finish it by myself.Two-course dinner were served where you can choose between a salad or soup as starter and choose among the available items for the mains. In our case, we all choose the salad for starter and for main course was the baby back ribs and swedish meat balls. It is affordable to get a decent meal on this place. The owner approach each table to check on how it is going, which is a plus, and he has a very approachable personality.Will surely return here whenever I got the chance and bring along friends to enjoy the homey place

Tucked in one of the shophouses-turned-business-establishments along Bukit Pasoh Road, this probably is a good place to hang out after a tiring day at work. When I and my friends came here, they have happy hour offer on housepour wine by the glass. They had dinner set menu which comes with either a salad or a soup. In our case, we chose salad. The chicken flakes tastes so familiar, adobo, a Filipino dish composed of soy sauce, vinegar, black pepper and garlic. Turns out, one of the chefs is a Filipino.The Swedish meatballs are juicy and the meat of barbeque ribs literally falls off the bones. The main dish comes rice which is a mixture of brown, red and jasmine.The ambiance is rustic, and the owner's chalkboard artworks are stacked on one corner. The menu board artwork is updated daily and menu specials changes weekly so better check their website, Instagram or Facebook accounts to know what's serving.

Love this small hideout in Bukit Pasoh area... this time we were back for our friend's birthday celebration. Everything was as good as our first visit! The staff and owner (Bill) are friendly and good at what they do, the layout is a bit retro yet interesting...worth your time to visit! The food are tasty as well at a reasonable price. Will visit more often and look forward to new dishes to order from the menu every time we go over! Another enjoyable evening! Thank you Bill for the birthday surprise to our friend that night! She really enjoyed herself very much!

I work close by and this is one of the places I have had lunch a few times. Price level is ok, the place is a bit quaint in a shop house. Food is ok but nothing fancy, oftenest asian in style, meat, rice, salad. I would go here for convenience, and not expect to be treated with any culinary /high note dishes, but ok satisfied
4
Highly recommended to try the smoked duck skewer ($12.90++).
There are also lunch sets available at $11.90 and menu is different for different days of the week.
Not too crowded at lunchhour, hence environment is quite conducive for meetings.

Nice deco cafe located in old shophouse. Good ambience with great food. Price is reasonable. Ordered pork rib and the taste is just right and portion is big. Would certainly visit again.

the staff is quite good, especially the boss recommended the l menu for us, the lunch not too much people

If you drive, park at the Pinnacle URA car park.The Milton Park shiraz I had was decent.The set menu is good value, $32 for two and $38 for three courses. You can select from the ala carte with very reasonable surcharge. The spinach soup was decent.The brown rice risotto with seafood was nice. Only an extra $2. However even though I asked to remove the mussel mine came with it. The deconstructed apple crumble and chocolate lava cakes were both decent.It could have earned a 4 but for getting the order wrong. Service was average given there were only four tables for dinner service

Bumped into it late evening along many other similar cafes and this one grabbed my attention with it's boutique setup and friendly service. The owners/staff seems to know their guests well, often seen chatting away and sharing thoughts. Had a bottle of cava which was decently priced, as well as truffles fries which was good mainly because I love truffles, but could have been better quality fries. Stayed at the Dorsett walking distance away but didn't know that they offer 15% discount for hotel guests by just showing your room key. I missed the discount which would have been great

This cafe is situated in a conserved heritage building, a stone's throw from a well-known boutique hotel. It was a weekday evening and needless to say, relatively quiet with three other tables. The decor can best be described as retro, with furnishings that reminded me of my childhood days. The team members were hospitable and service-oriented, and constantly inquired about our satisfaction level. Dinner was the French onion soup, pesto risotto and fish. I asked if they could swop some ingredients in the risotto and they gladly did. The soup, in my personal opinion, was slightly salty and the risotto could be a little drier as it was a tad creamy. Nevertheless, I loved how the cheese melts in your mouth and how the risotto crunches when you bite into it.I like a fond farewell and this the owner did extremely well when he did exactly that as we got up to leave. Not a lot of establishments care about the departure experience. This earned an extra star from this reviewer. Well done

First the pros- nice, laid back 70's inspired eclectic decor, friendly and helpful staff, decent food and prices are inclusive of gst with no service charge. But, something is still missing... maybe the portions are a little small, and the cooking, while acceptable, does not really justify its price. Also, they did not print a la carte prices on their menu, and when we enquired, turns out that it was cheaper to order a la carte than to package the items in a set! Very strange.

Happened to be in the area and dropped by for a late dinner. Been here for lunch before and 1st time for dinner. They have a la carte and set menus. From a la carte , I ordered the beef steak. It took a while , about 25min to arrive. But at least the owner came by to update. It's thinnish and overly salted, but ok tasting
5
A very rustic place. The blackboards reminds me so much of school in the past.... The doodling and also the writing of lines as punishment. Can even see some very old TV, a singer sewing machine and so on. Nice staff, good food, cool boss! I enjoyed the place. Will be back!!!

I come here every time I'm in Singapore. The restaurant serves great food and is very reasonably priced for Singapore. It's in a beautiful old converted shophouse with a lovely small park at the back. The restaurant is very quaint with eclectic furniture and a wonderful casual homely ambience. The owner Bill is a great host makes a point of welcoming customers and ensuring good service

In an old traditional Singaporean house, it is unexpected to find a decor that more reminds the 50s and 60s, all chosen and set up with good taste. The food is good, wines just ok.
5
An interesting and unique place with it's decorations.
Good food and very value for money.
Recommend this to those who wants to try something with a local flavor.

The food was delicious and the ambiance is fantastic. The price is reasonable too! Service was pretty average though but I think it's a one man show cafe so very admirable!

This place is unpretentious, comfortable, and with really friendly staff. The food here isn't anything to shout about, but the very personable environment and service is enough to make me want to come back.

This cafe is a shophouse along Bukit Pasoh road. You would not be able to find this cafe unless you are looking for it and you cannot see the interior of the place till you push open the doors. It actually looks like its closed because of the dim lighting but do go ahead and push those retro doors open.I wasn't exactly sure if I found the right place when I stepped in as it actually looks like you entered a curio shop with retro items greeting you. When you adjust to the dim lighting, it is actually a pretty interesting place to eat and chill out.Food is home-styled - tasty, decent portions and value for money. An interesting mix of dishes appear on their menu - from american styled fried chicken and wedges, to french duck confit, to good old italian pasta. They do also serve some local dishes. Its a nice informal place to hang out with friends and family without spending a fortune on your food and still get good tasting food. Service is good - casual, friendly and warm - just like how it should be in an easy going setting like this. Do note however that there are no high chairs available

We tried this place in Outram Park for lunch today. It's located within a short walk of the mrt and for sure we should have taken that option instead of walking there from the city. Lunch sets are fairly simple affairs but are also quite cheap at about $12 each. Seemed quite healthy too. The place was full by the time we had finished. Worth a visit

Been here a couple of times for late evening drinks a few years ago and 1st time having lunch. They serve a mixture of local and western food here so decided to bring some friends from LondonThis place is cosy, has homey decor and there are about 10 table of varying sizes. Quickly over lunchtime, this place fills up fast and was completely full by 130We all ordered 1 of the set lunches of the day - bak kut teh, local herbal pork rib soup. It comes with a free drink , iced tea. The main was interesting. Not quite the same as what we'll get from hawker or Chinese restaurants. It tasted like a fusion version . When I asked Bill the chef owner, he just humbly and honestly said he felt he couldn't do it as well as the traditional joints! He needs a marketing guru I think We ordered desserts - lava cake and Creme brûlée. They were pretty good as wellAll in all, at $20 per person, this is good value. I may return for dinner next tim

Had lunch at Eight cafe while waiting for an appointment. Been hearing a lot about this restaurant and finally can get to try it myself.Ordered their set lunch of the day (chicken stew) upon recommendation which come with free drink.Quite a crowd during lunch.The restaurant was nicely decorated and the food was nice.Would recommend this restaurant for small gathering and chill out

Came here for lunch with a few other colleagues. We had a tough time deciding what to eat because everything on the menu sounded good!I ordered fish and chips. the dish was supposed to come in wedges but the restaurant allowed me to change my wedges to fries without having to pay extra! The dish was great. There was a generous amount of salad, fish and fries. My colleague who had duck also mentioned that the duck was very well cooked. Waiters were attentive and friendly, so it made the lunch even better.I'd definitely recommend this place. While the restaurant isn't huge, i think the place is great for small gatherings. Plus, the food is very affordable

Bring cash come here early, scope out a place by the bar, wait for the kitchen window to open. Yes you actually do that in that order. HA. We got here early so the place only had a few customers. My friend and I grabbed a seat at the bar and was deciding what to order. The bartender was friendly and chit chatting with us on various drinks, telling us what his special drink was. Finished our drinks, got another round, still waiting for the kitchen to order, the line was starting to form so we decided to check out the menu before it got too crowded and had our space saved at the bar. I got in line to order while my friend went back and made sure we didn't loose our spot. Who the heck servers lobster mac! This place does and it is good. We got their fries also good but not as crisp as I like them. Cold asparagus! So good. We need to go back soon

Ate (and imbibed) here a few times during my visit, and will definitely return! Bill, the owner, is super friendly and attentive! Nice crowd, open later on weekends. Food was delightful as well.

Food selection was average. However when it comes to quality and presentation it was a let down.
Great location (near the MRT station) Loved the deco & lovely ambiance.
May not have a reason for a second visit.

We had a very nice brunch with spinach salad, eggs benedict & steak and eggs. Great ambiance, excellent service and friendly staff! Very accomodating!
5
We came here twice during our one week stay in Singapore - which is saying something given the choice of wonderful eateries. A definite must.

Wonderful little spot with friendly service, a variety of interesting food choices, and very reasonable prices. My wife and I ducked in for a light lunch - she had a mixed salad with duck; I had prawns and noodles in a spicy coconut soup. Those two dishes plus two glasses of wine came to under S$40. The service was prompt and the servers quite personable

we happen to be there and when we walk down the street ,we saw the lunch promotion and we felt we should try it,it came out nice as it had free drink and chef special,the most surprising is the ice cream,sea salt cameral and lavandar honey,is really great,n is value for price,it is 6.80 for two scoop

When it comes to Sunday Brunch, there need to be a few things that come together - great food, friendly service, relaxing ambiance and somewhere to toddle off to after you have done guzzling down your brunch. The Eight Cafe & Bar is a real treat. With its warm, funky and retro inspired setting it is immediately somewhere you can relax. Situated on Bukit Pasoh the space is large and offers plenty of options both inside and outside. The menu is straightforward and while some say it is a bit pricey, given the quality I think its value for money. For a start, its cooked to perfection. The beef sausage ( i had a choice ) was perfect, and the bacon is perfectly crisped. The little touches of the bread and preserve, herbed potatoes etc are all presented beautifully. The menu is quite extensive and offers plenty of a la carte options including adding free flow prosecco or wine. While its mainly a western oriented menu, during the week it does skew towards Asian and to compliment your brunch why not try the home made herbal tea. Its delicious and helps to offset the pangs of guilt on downing so much protein! The service is attentive and personalised - the proprietor Bill works jolly hard to make everything run smoothly and look after the guests. Having enjoyed a wonderful brunch, its central location makes it then ideal for a walk around Chinatown, Club Street, Ann Siang Hill - all the perfect post brunch strolls you could need

I'm surprised to see the positive reviews about this restaurant/cafe. My colleagues and I dined here on a random Wednesday night and the place was empty but for one table of three guys and 8 of us work colleagues. The cafe is accessible enough and is located a stone's throw away from the Outram Park MRT Station. Our first impression that the cafe is very small in size, very dimly lit. It feels cozy but really it's just a tiny place. We were shown to our table and provided with menu's. The food had exorbitant prices for the standard of a hole-in-the-wall cafe type setting. The set menu for dinner was about SGD38 per person for two courses, and SGD 45 per person for three courses. My dinner party consisted of three ladies, and five men. The set menu actually makes no sense as some combinations of appetizers and main courses / desserts ordered ala-carte actually costs less than the set! When we took issue with this, the staff had nothing to say. After we ordered, one of the staff started to hard-sell some kind of Portugese wine at a "special promotional price" of SGD40. We obliged and asked for a bottle. When the bottle was brought out, one of my male colleagues inspected the bottle and found the labelling to be very dubious. There was a brand name - but the wine label had no indication about the year in which the wine was made, and it had no details that are usually attached to wine labels. Unfortunately as the staff had already opened the bottle, we had no choice but to consume the dubious wine.The food was palatable - but it wasn't spectacular. I had the steak which was quite good but the portions left a lot to be desired. We also ordered some glasses of water for the table - but it took an eternity for them to serve us with water! Imagine if we had ordered a more complicated drink. The dessert was hum-drum dull. An apple pie with ice cream, and some kind of creme-brulee wannabe. Overall, for the price that was paid - we certainly expected more. We didn't find the meal to be satisfying at all, and despite consuming dessert, we actually adjourned to a different dessert shop down the road to fill our tummies for a 2nd round.Needless to say, it was a colossal waste of time jostling the crowds on the train for a visit to this cafe. I don't think I will be returning

This place is a real surprise in Singapore. It is in an old shop house building and full of atmosphere. The daily set menu has heaps of great options and wonderful food. The service was spot on and friendly. this is a great option in Singapore which is normally overpriced and sterile

I visited Eight together with my parents who were visiting from South Africa. They are both in their 80's and are usually small and fussy eaters. My father had the duck breast, which he had never tried cooked pink before, my mother the duck confit leg and I had the cod. All were extremely tasty as were the warm bread rolls served with the food. Service was friendly and polite, not overly attentive as one gets in some places which can be irritating. So much for small eaters! My parents finished every scrap - my father declaring it the best duck he had ever eaten - not bad for someone of 87! In fact we managed to squeeze in two desserts as well - the warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and the blueberry cheesecake. The whole meal and experience was a treat and a really good deal as well. I will be bac
