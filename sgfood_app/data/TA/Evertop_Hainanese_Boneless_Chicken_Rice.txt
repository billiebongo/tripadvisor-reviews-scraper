The chicken rice is average but the service is quite good. This chicken rice store is own by Chinese but the food there is halal. Be prepared to pay more than the average price of a chicken rice compared to food court or hawker centre

I like their salted fish taugeh and Thai style tofu the most. Tried both the roasted and steam chicken version. Tasty and addictive.
Service is superb with very friendly staff.

This place not only serves up excellent chicken rice but also caters for the muslim folks whom can also enjoy Singapore's most favorite dish.
They also have other items on their menu which are excellent.

Bought the roasted chicken rice and fried wanton. No excellent but edible. Expensive for a plate of chicken rice. $4 bucks per plate.
One good thing is that the chicken were juicy and tender.

Tried their boneless roasted chicken rice set when I visited Singapore. It was good, but not special. Average would be the description for it. A little pricey too for what was offered. Overall, I did not have a special impression of their chicken rice and probably wouldn't come back to eat there again.

There is the elusive quest for the "real" Singapore, also food-wise, and in many ways this is it: In the middle of the housing jungle, West Coast area (= no tourists, businessmen, ang moh expats etc.), not easy to find but 7 mins. from Clementi MRT. Hainanese chicken rice is often said to be the signatory dish of Singapore, and the one here is just totally excellent - couldn't fault it in any way. Simple setup, airy, spacey, friendly staff, bizarrely fast. I also liked the Lemon Chicken. (No sauce, just the fried chicken is lemony.) Not overly cheap, but this is Singapore. An interesting feature is that this is a Halal place, i.e. Muslims can eat here as well (although they won't often do that right now because of the Ramadan of course) - which means it's a pork-free Chinese place, which is odd but works because of the chicken orientation. This is the place to become a loyal customer. Just writing this review makes me hungry again. :

We started eating with them while they were still a stall in a coffee shop more than 15 years ago. While the steam chicken remains good the quality of the rice, an important part of chicken rice has drop. Sometimes, I wish they will not diversify into a restaurant and remain true to the one dish that they do well

If you are ever near Clementi Avenue 2 and can't find anything to you liking, head over to this old favorite.Evertop used to be located at Tanglin Halt 46-1 Commonwealth Drive. Though this area of Clementi is a little slower, their great tasting tender steamed (white)chicken, full flavored rice and powerful sharp chilli hits the spot every time.There's usually available seating so not much fuss, peak hour rules apply.Overall:Seating: 8/10Food: 9/10Location: 6/1

The best Halal Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant Vie been, The staff and owner are always around to greet their customers. Food wise, I really enjoyed their fragrance Hainanese Chicken Rice. But I always opted for the usual white chicken instead of the roasted chicken. Try their fried wanton or ngor hiang, Thety also serve kangkong belacan or cereal prawns. Their outlet in Joo Chiat also serve Seafood Horfun and other noodl;e dishes. You wont regret

The chicken was cooked just nice:Juicy and succulent... Accompanied by rice that was fragrant with hints of Pandan and ginger... The only thing that was a major let down was the chilli sauce... Did not taste anything like chilli sauce that would go well with chicken rice!
