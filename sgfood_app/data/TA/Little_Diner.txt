Pleasantly surprised with the wide selection of craft beers at Little Diner. Attentive service. Great value. Amazing food. MAC and cheese’s the bomb.
5
Went there for lunch with parents, very impressive lunch set, especially the Beef Burger - worth the calories! Very friendly and thoughtful services make dining experience there indeed fabulous.
3
A nice, casual restaurant with a good menu. This is the second occasion my family and I have eaten there and it was not as good as the first time. The food was fairly good but the service was poor, including the main courses being served up to 20 minutes apart, the staff being inattentive and leaning across eating diners to serve / remove dishes, etc.

My friend wanted to try this place out for lunch. And I frequently pass by this establishment, but have never entered nor had any urge to. Damn if only I had known. Lets start off with customer service. Super friendly staff. It made me think. "I really want to be best friends with you guys" That was the kind of feeling I received, and damn I really wanted to get down on one knee and propose friendship with the waitstaff. Moving on to food, since that is what you are reading this for.Prior to the visit, I read the reviews. They all said to try out the Mac n Cheese. I can somewhat claim that I am a connoisseur when it comes to Mac n Cheese, having blazed a trail throughout the world with me trying out Mac n Cheese in various countries and form. So I did. I went old school, cause a good ole' mac n cheese should not be interrupted with all those additional ingredients. And also to gauge the chefs skill. Lets just say, for me, it was the best I have ever tried. You know sometimes you get those mac n cheese where it was so thick and creamy, that you feel it coming back out of your mouth, cause it was just too much. Not this one. This had such a perfect balance of cream, cheese and that top crust. The serving may look small, but for someone with my appetite, I only finished half. There are 3 kinds of mac n cheese. - old school- with bacon- with truffle oilMy friend ordered the roasted chicken breast and that was cooked to juicy perfection. No need to add condiments. A true test of a chef skill is whether or not customers add condiments to their meal. No condiments necessary at this fine establishment. Big servings at great price, with great service and food. Seriously, I am trying to rake my brains for something negative, but i cant do that to my 'besties'My recommendation. Please please visit this place and try the food out yourself. It is worth it

Greeted with a personalised placard on the table upon arrival, with reservation. Pleasantly surprised. Restaurant was accommodative to my needs (a screaming, crying child) and wait staffs were friendly. Only blemish was the wrong order taken which the restaurant took back without complaint, unpleasant though that may be. Overall a great little restaurant. Price is quite steep but I'm happy to pay for this kind of service. Oh yeah, parking is a nightmare. Park at Guthrie House behind the restaurant
3
We went there for lunch. The set lunch is good value for money. We were disappointed with the burger but the other set lunch choices, e.g. fish or pulled pork tortilla wrap, were good. You can top up to have the desserts which were yummy too. The location is very convenient by MRT, just a stone throw away from the Sixth Avenue MRT station
5
My experience at little diner was nothing short of mind blowing. I got 6 star service for 10 star value. The service was personal, the food was timely, the beer was perfectly cold and I felt right at home. Except my home is not beautiful as little diner. Amazing. I would recommend all my friends and even my worst enemies to eat here. Because life is too short to have enemies and no one will leave little diner without becoming new friends.Also, the MAC and cheese was CRAZY.Props to Little Diner and their amazing crew. If you are not eating here tomorrow, then I guarantee you will have a disappointing meal
4
This is a small restaurant next to Sixth Avenue. Limited parking in front of the restaurant so best to park at Guthrie House. There is a wide range of food such as crab cakes, risotto balls, chicken drumlets, pork ribs, fried chicken and burgers. There are also good selection of craft beers. Good service and cosy atmosphere.
4
Had the sweet potato truffle fries and croissant as savouries, and the nutella french toast for dessert. Had the french toast before, and as usual, it did not disappoint. Would be nice to have an ice cream with the french toast though. Sweet potato fries were good too. The egg in the croissant was on the dry side. Service could be more flexible. We wanted to change the fries in a ribs item to sweet potato fries, but cafe didnt allow that, even though we were prepared to top up money.
5
So how many heart eyes can you give to a fried chicken dish? Well, in the case of The Little Diner's All-American Buttermilk Fried Chicken, not nearly enough to articulate the utter perfection of this dish. The crust was perfectly crispy without being too oily, and the chicken flesh was utterly tender. Best of all, the chicken was tasty - no condiments required. The coleslaw that accompanied the chicken was delicious too. All in all, this was a sublime dish & I definitely returning for more
4
It’s an underrated cafe along the stretch of dunearn road. The food is always good. Pretty homely and value for money.
5
I don’t remember a disappointing visit to The Little Diner. Food is always filling and flavourful. Service is always friendly and prompt. Thank you for a really satisfying brunch!
5
love their salmon (medium), risotto balls and steak. good value for money, but definitely expect 35-40 a pax
4
The promotions are worth visiting for! My friend and I ordered a burger each and it did not disappoint. Keep up the standards Little Diner!
5
I headed to Little Diner as part of birthday dinner for my boyfriend. The food was definitely good but slightly expensive nonetheless! Good ambience and excellent service!
On the side note, there are car park lots right by the door of the shop too!
3
Quite a nice number of beers to choose.
Food presentation was not bad.
Only thing, after the dinner, upon reaching home, felt extremely thirsty.
Suspect too much aginomoto used in the food.
Quote nice ambience/environment, but gets a bit noisy when more diners came.
5
Good location, just 3min walk from the MRT station.
A cosy little place serving good food .
Service was fabulous too.
5
The pulled pork sandwich was great, huge amount of pork. Even the simple fries were amazing. Apples in the apple crumble were a wee bit bland but otherwise, great desert too! Plus excellent service. What’s there not to like?
5
Great place to catch up with friends. Good food at an affordable price, great atmosphere and attentive staff.
3
Went for an afternoon brunch during the weekend. Ordered their speciality Egg Benedictâ€™s and another Nutella and banana French toast. The former was alright but would not recommend the latter which was way not worth the calories.The service staffs are attentive and friendly which are commendable.
4
Haven’t been here in a while but always a pleasure to be back. Just love the cozy laid back nature of this place. They have interesting craft beers available here. The XXX Baconator was a tad underwhelming in terms of size though.
5
A place that is less overhyped but with good quality food. Always go for the salad with beef and with a guilty pressure of sweet potato fries.
5
We have been here a couple of times and every time we visit, Little Dinner does not disappoint as their food is good - we always have a hard time deciding what to order!
4
Ordered the BBQ baby ribs and fish & chips. The food is nice esp the ribs which is soft and succulent. Service was prompt.
5
Krusty Crab Egg Benedict highly recommended for Brunch. Worth for the price and definitely will be back again :)
4
Went to celebrate my mother’s birthday, staff was friendly and attentive. Good service, good food. All in all, had a great time there!
4
Ordered the BBQ Pigwich and it was great. Generous portion of meat and even though it's just pulled pork in the burger, it felt more delicious with every bite. Would definitely come back for that. Great place to just catch up with your friends and have a good dinner.
5
Service was prompt. When we were settled down in our seats, the staff brought us menus and water almost immediately. We wanted to order crabcakes but were informed that they were out of stock, which was a pity. Risotto balls were good, and I would have loved the tomato coulis to be slightly acidic. Lamb ragu was great. Al dente tagliatelle, tender lamb shank cooked in a marinara sauce, drizzled with basil oil and sprinkled with Parmesan. What's not to like? However, the time it took for the food to come was slightly long. But that aside, a pleasurable experience. (definitely going back for the crab cakes!

Was wondering where to go for my darling Jac's birthday dinner. My son Matt recommended Little Diner, said it was good when he and his poly friends went there a few months ago. I must say, this little restaurant didnt disappoint. It seems they have to booking slots.. 6pm and out by 8pm..and second wave from 8pm onwards. We took the 8pm slot.The restaurant was about three quarter filled when we got there. Even after the first wave, the crew were still cheerful... welcomes and hellos as we walked in.The design is nice simple and kinda cosy albeit a little dim... but who's splitting hairs.Anyways.. menus were presented.. we took 10 minutes to look at it.. and ... we ordered... i had the xxxbacon burger.. (damn i swear.. the beef patty looked and tasted hand made) wife had a steak, the rest had fish and chips, pull pork burger and a baby back ribs... we had a side order of calamari and truffles fries.What can I say... everyone enjoyed what they ordered... Needless to say, we had a good enjoyable family dinner.. we love this place and will be back again soon.So if you ever find yourself at Sixth Avenue, do pop in for a bite. Oh, we didnt order wine that night at dinner (cos we had a bottle of Muscato chilling in the fridge at home) they seem to have quite an extensive wine list.Anyways, they are situated at one of the shop houses just as you exit the Sixth Avenue MRT station
4
Substantial portion, tasty food, value for money indeed. Loved the nutella french toast, though it would have paired well with a scoop of ice cream rather than whipped cream. Had the croissant too, which was good, except the scrambled egg which was a lil dry. Boyfriend had the half rack pork ribs which was done well
5
I don’t think I have had another MAC n cheese that is better than Little Diner’s. It was so amazing. The service was awesome and wait staff were really friendly. 10/10 would come back!
5
Hands down the best Mac & Cheese in town.
We had the Aglio Olio which was awesome as well.
A no fuss restaurant with truly good food. I’d give 6 stars if there was that option.
4
Wide range of food and drinks on menu. This was my second visit to Little Diner. Food was still as good and the ambience was cosy.
4
LOVE love love their croque madame!!! Back here for the 3rd time and tired the steak sandwich too. YUM
5
Went for brunch with family on a Sunday morning. Food was great, good service and nice atmosphere. Make sure to make a reservation on the weekend. Table with marked with a very cute name tag.
5
Loved the food here. Tried the truffle mac and cheese,steaks and salmon. They were all fantastic! Would come again!
4
Came here for the Mac and cheese and it was delicious! The mixture of cheese was creamy and fragrant, totally tantalising. We would recommend getting a portion of the dish and another main or sides to share to add to the variety. Great place to gather and catch up over comfort food, anytime
4
The dining experience was pleasant, and service is great! I made the reservation for a later timing but wanted to go earlier, they managed to save me a table even with the last minute change. They're polite & friendly. Food was not fantastic but still good. Will visit again!
4
A cosy cafe along Bukit Timah Road just before 6th Avenue where there's just a few car park lots but ample parking in nearby Guthrie House.Good burgers, truffle fries, sweet potato fries but the best was the Old School Mac and Cheese! Add the bacon for $2 more since this gives an irresistible bacon twist to an old favourite. There's also what's called Version 2 - The Rolls Royce of Mac and Cheese that has truffle and mushrooms but I must say I liked the traditional old school one better.Good range of beers and a selection of craft beers, ciders and interesting teas. The milkshakes like Kinder Bueno are creative but a tad too sweet.There aren't too many seats so I would strongly recommend reservations
5
Tried their truffle mac & cheese and it was truly the bomb :) The serving was slightly big so it would be advisable to share with a friend. It is hard to find good mac & cheese, but this one completely win hands down. Their service was top notch too - water was served the moment i sat down and food was served within a reasonable timing too.Would definitely come back again! :
5
Delicious, value for money. Awesome, sincere and personal service. Crab cake was crispy on outside and fluffy inside. Crab pasta was generous with ingredients.
4
Nice place, love the ambience and glad they didn't make a fuss when my 1 year old was making noise. Had the wagyu beef steak and it was GOOD!
5
Nice dinner and great service. Wed night promotion - 50% off 2nd dish makes gd food go easier on the wallet 😀 love the linguine and wagyu beef!
4
Have been quite sometimes... so I had salad with strip beef and sweet potato fries. Portions were generous as usual. Love it.
4
We have been here for the 3rd time. Food is decent and service is great (save for the waiter being forgetful to check on our requests). Will be back again.
5
Great service, great food and ambience. Will definitely visit again. Bought the 50 voucher which has a 10% off, was great.
4
Very nice environment and good service, however the wait time for the food was a little slow and the portions a bit small for my 2 course meal.
4
Great burgers. Good selection and delicious. Good selection of beers. Location is fairly accessible.
4
Singapore is a food paradise. So much so that I stopped being surprised because there was no point to it. Food scene has become so much more awesome than when I first moved 21 years ago. I was looking to eat a Sunday lunch (what else!). I decided to try this place. First, cozy, comfy with a very enveloping aura inside. It is literally tucked away between a couple of stores and they have a small sign asking you to come in. Now for the food! The selection was very good. They had lots of options including a good set of burgers. They had a selection of eggs Benedict which I am sure would have rocked but we decided to go with burgers. The Mexican style. Simple, nicely done, with hot chipotle sauce and fries or chips (depending on where you are from). The burger was excellent. The fries were fresh, crisp and were a good side to the burger. Filling portion. Then we decided to try their craft beers and they had a very good selection. We went with something called "Sauvignon Ale". Hold your horses! Wine + Beer? Sure! Lets give it a shot. It was an interest potion/brew. Had the flavour of wine but tasted beerish, if that even makes sense. All in all a pleasant and enjoyable experience
5
We had very good experience @Little Dinner.We love the food and drinks specially the milkshake (to die for..)The burger (Tuesday Burger & Craft beer day) was made perfectly as I like and my partner took a fish which was very good!Took some craft beers and enjoyed it.We will be back for brunch with the kids
5
The food is good. The waiter and waitress attend to us pretty fast since it's a small cafe. They helped us to refill our water without the need to ask them to.
The atmosphere is pretty romantic since they use dim lighting.
4
The mac and cheese was great. However, the cod fish that i ordered was very very small and didn't look appealing.
4
Cosy little diner. Love the Mac and Cheese as well as the truffle handcut fries! Always come back for the fries!
4
Food was good and the place is nice. It was quiet and not crowded. However a little on the pricey side. Pretty good for a cafe!
5
Delectable food at an affordable price. Went for the weekday set lunch and the dishes (crab cakes, smoked duck salad, beef burger, crab linguine) turned out to be surprisingly good! A great place to hang out with family and friends.
5
Ordered pigwich (pulled pork burger), truffle fries, fried rissotto ball (with melted cheese inside), and kinder bueno milkshake.
totally love them! Taste was fantastic!! Great service and nice deco of the place!
Highly recommend the place if you love american diner!!
3
if you want a better burger, go to Dempsey or club st. but little diner fills a niche in that prices are lower than those aforementioned places, and it saves you having to go downtown. Food is ok, 7 out of 10, nothing spectacular. but then again, you get what you pay for.
4
The ambience is modern minimalism for diner, which is a bit rare. The royal mac&cheese is richly creamy and sticky and the fried chicken is amazingly juicy and tender but the let down is the desert. We ordered bread pudding. It tastes like it was made in some central kitchen, totally soulless and dull
4
Cafe added a lot of personal touch - reserved table were placed with name tags. There isnt a need to ask the waiter for direction to my table. Name tag was hand-written and very beautifully designed. In terms of food, the cafe offered an extensive menu. Tried the fish and chips and pulled pork burger, both servings came with generous portions of hand-cut fries which were nicely done. Pulled pork burger is definitely a must-try, easily one of the better ones out there
2
I'm so disappointed! I read great reviews and came here to try their food.American buttermilk chicken- 6/10It generally tastes ok but it's so salty and I had to drink so much water after eating it. The horrible fries (see picture) were soggy and really cold.Crab cakes- 6/10The crab cakes are nicely marinated but they used canned crab meat. It's $12.50 for 2 small pieces of crab cakesMac and cheese v2- 2/10I can't describe to you how bad it is. But I cannot finish it. Left the entire portion after 2 spoonful. (See picture) overloaded with loose choose which tastes greasy. No truffle taste at all. Uses lousy shimeiji mushrooms. It's really horrible!Bacon and cheese rissole- 6/10Tastes ok. Nothing special
5
Best mac&cheese in SG!! Especially the new version 2 with mushrooms and truffle oil :) (plus no bacon!!:))
5
Little Djner has never failed to tickle my tastebuds with their selection of mains and sides. Every time I try something new it makes me want to come back again.
4
2nd time here! I'm back for their croque madame cause it's just so good!!! The truffle taste was distinct and went really well with everything.
3
Ambience was great. Definitely need reservation to avoid disappointment. Food wise, would give 6.5/10. Price is on the mid to high side.
4
Service was great and food was delicious. Last year I celebrated my birthday here and decided to do it again this year. Love this restaurant because of the warm reception and great service. The food always served within optimal time and deliciously prepared.
4
Small place, cosy for catch ups over meal with loved ones. Love their Mac & cheese 👍. Friendly staff are attentive as well.
5
fantastic food at reasonable prices.................
........great ambience ,attentive staff................
what else do you need?
4
the place is not too big and high ceiling just nice for a couple to have some private time as well as small group for dinner. The fresh mushroom soup is a must to start with for your dinner. They have different special every night to choose depends on your appetite. I personally will go for the pasta with tiger prawn as main course and apple crumbles to end for the evening
3
Colleagues enjoyed the burgers - they had the XXX baconator and one of them remarked that the bacon jam was the most delicious part of the dish. I had a salad and chose to add grilled tiger prawns for an additional $8 -- however, the prawns that came were regular-sized prawns, and I only got 6 of them. Not quite what I was expecting... They seemed rather understaffed, and our food took a long time to come.
4
Snatched a 1-for-1 mac & cheese promotion using Snatch App which made it only $20.50++ for 2 mac & cheese (old school and version 2)! Really enjoyed the version 2 with the addition of truffle and mushrooms. Though sharing is highly recommended as the generous portion of cheese and thick creamy sauce might get a tad overwhelming after awhile. Also ordered a side of bacon & cheese risseroles (potato croquettes filled with bacon bits and cheese) that was satisfying and enjoyable as well! Service is warm, comforting and friendly too
5
Amazing food, excellent service and reasonable prices- worth the experience!!! I will definitely return back to this place!
5
The food were mostly great and the service crew were really friendly and attentive. Ambience was nice too
5
Awesome place to dine and their food were amazing! We managed to watch a few people doing the ultimate challenge burger and it was pretty interesting.
5
Cosy little cafe with minimal sitting space & their French toast, MACncheese shakes are worth to try
4
Lovely diner in Bukit Timah. The quality of the food is good and reasonable portion. Shall return again.
4
The nice food with pleasant ambiance. However, the place is small so it can get pretty noisy. Overall experience was good.
5
The staff that day were very courteous and the food served was quick and was really good. The only downside was that my husband's order of the hangover burger. We ordered the beef to be medium rare but it came out quite rare in the centre, probably just rare. but it wasnt too bad. overall, worth going back again! their brunch dessert pancake was to die for
4
I like that its very conveniently located close to an MRT exit. I found the way that my name was displayed indicating my reserved table very special. The food was tasty and portion sizes were just right. Service was friendly and proactive. I definitely would go back to dine again
4
Located right next to Sixth Avenue Downtown line, Little Diner is a treat for any occasion. The cosy lighting is perfect for a romantic meal and the seating arrangement great for small family gathering. They serve those micro-brewery beer you don't get to experience so often. The service is on-point and friendly. The price is affordable but the star of the show is the crunchy-worth-every-calorie Fried chicken (which takes 20 mins to prepare and lesser time to lick every crumb off the plate). Although take note that Fried Chicken only available for dinner, not lunch. My other favourites are the spicy Aglio Olio with fresh prawns. And then there is the almighty comfort food: Mac N Cheese. There are 2 types and i swear i can't decide which 1 i prefer. Last but not least, The Pulled Pork...sweet, tangy, generous threads of pork that makes you want to savour every bite of it.The diner is not a huge spacious place and gets pretty crowded on weekends lunch and dinner including fridays. So do try to reserve to avoid disappointment
3
We came for brunch, the restaurant was not crowded. They have a nice name tag for our reservation. Nice little restaurant, no smell of cooking oil in the restaurant. We ordered Croque Madam, Nutella French toast, fish and chips and hangover burger. I would give 5 stars to both French toast and croque Madame. 2 stars for fish and chips and burger. The Chips were soft and soggy. Fish was not tasty. Burger was average, turn out medium rare while we ordered medium. Plain bun was used. Not much sauce on burger. Restaurant was noisy due to the design (cement and wall)
4
Quaint little spot with great ambience. Perfect for gatherings with friends or for bringing your significant other. Best mac n cheese I have had in Singapore!
5
We had the southern fried chicken and blue mussels, with a side of handcut truffle fries, and everything was cooked to perfection! The handwritten place card with my name on it was a very touch. I had a wonderful dinner here.
4
Good customer service. Fast serving. But was disappointed with the fish and chip. The fish is hot and crispy but the fries is cold , soggy and greasy- we definitely expect more crispy fries !
5
My friend & I had the lunch set which is value for money. We ordered the apple crumble to share which is another $4 top up.
5
Had a great night at Little Diner. We in fact reached there earlier than the reservation time but the table had been prepared for us with a welcome note. The ambient is cozy and food is great. We ordered different dishes and none of them disappointed us! Must-try dishes: BBQ Pigwich burger, Mac&cheese and American buttermilk fried chicken.
4
I was at Little Diner for lunch on 27 December. We were seated promptly. Two of us, both female, ordered the risotto balls, barb cake and a lamb ragu pasta to share. The serving was quite big and we couldn't finish the food even though we enjoyed it. The service was efficient. Will definitely come back
5
Food is amazing but a little too salty? (Felt thirsty the night after the meal). Kinder Bren milkshake is a MUST ORDER! Light and chocolatey. King's burger consisting of 3 patties + 4 bread + endless soggy fries! Overall an amazing meal - hearty comfort food!
1
After a long day, very hungry and in need of sustenance after work my wife suggested she try Deliveroo, Little Diner as she had seen the restaurant and it seemed ok quality and sufficient to be satisfying. I had already eaten.She chose the House salad with grilled tiger prawns, hand cut fries and roasted carrots & Zucchini. See photos.I honestly don’t know if dining is is better or not? Maybe the portions and quality is the same maybe not, and they think because they do not see the customer via Deliveroo it is ok to provide this POOR level of customer service.Firstly, the Prawn salad was extremely disappointing in flavour, quality and quantity. It does not qualify for an appetizer let alone a main meal. The 3 small prawns as you can see were less than 30g in total. Secondly the hand cooked fries, quantity was fine the fries themselves seemed to be ok although they did not bother to cook them properly, the fries were not crispy, they were soggy. They were still warm as the driver delivered in 3min as we are not too far away. Where they failed here was to make the effort to cook fries correctly and re-fry. I think they just did not care…..Lastly the roasted vegies, what can I say, this is not a SIDE that you pay extra for, this is a side that would normally be included as part of a meal. Seriously 100g.When I served this to my wife she broke down and cried, after working such a long day and to come home and pay for a meal using our money we had worked for we both feel she was cheated and it really destroyed the rest of her evening. Honestly, how is someone supposed to have a satisfying dinner with this quality and quantity of food which cost her almost $30. I called the business and asked to speak with the manager, which they did now want me to do. Eventually they put on someone who sounded like the person who answered the phone so I really don’t know. I explained my dissatisfaction and asked how can your business sustain this, their response was this is the correct serving quantities and they do not get customers complaining about their food. Clearly this was a lie, we can see from other reviews this business is NOT without much customer issues.They offered no compensation nor apology.  I only gave them 1 star because 0 was not an optionAll I can say is I hope this review deters customers from being fooled and cheated as we were when ordering via Deliveroo.We will never be going near this establishment again
3
We were at this cosy place for dinner. Location is very convenient as it was steps away from Sixth Avenue MRT. Fried Rissotto was good. Steak and fish were average. Service was generally good but could be improved as the waitress had no idea on what wine and beer to recommend because she said she doesn't drink. Well, many restaurants' waiters and waitresses have the necessary knowledge in what is popular and the good ones could even describe the taste when making recommendations. Nevertheless, we had an enjoyable time catching up with friends during our dinner at Little Diner. Price was reasonable
4
Food was generally okay.For 2 persons, the bill came up to be about $70, which included 2 mains, 1 side, 1 dessert and 1 drink.Other then that, the interior was pretty nice and cosy.Service level was also ok, drinking water was replenished without the need to ask the crew
4
I had a team lunch and decided on this place after reading some good reviews about it. The service was prompt and courteous. The staff kept filling our water glasses. I enjoyed my set lunch and the roast chicken was extremely moist.
5
Definitely one of the best western food restaurants we've visited! We ordered the "Mac & Cheese", "Buttermilk Fried Chicken" and "XXX Baconator". Thumbs up for all three! The staff were friendly and efficient. Would definitely visit the restaurant again!
5
Staff were really friendly. The set lunch was definitely value for money & pretty good. The restaurant felt very cozy as well.
4
If you are in the Bukit Timah area and crave for comfort food, the Little Diner rarely disappoints!!
5
Found it really cute when I saw they actually wrote a card with my name saying the table is reserved. Lovely visit overall with great food and ambience
5
Really a great place to have a romantic dinner or celebrate your birthday with your family and friends. Prices very reasonable and food excellent!
3
We went on Sunday 1pm, thinking the brunch ends st 1pm but it actually ends at 3.30pm on Fri/Sat/Sun. We were super disappointed that we couldn't get to order the double cut pork chops for both the guys, in the end we had 1 pull pork burger which is yummy! The pork was very smokey & not too dry. The French toast which comes with the banana fritters, was too sweet to taste, maybe we all didn't have a sweet tooth. The girlies both have the steak & chips, yummy slab but the medium-rare was too raw on the inside, very nicely done on the outside though. My gf ordered medium done, which is nicely done! *recommend
5
This is one of the best places for brunch. The food is delicious and service is good too. This was my second visit to this place in 6 weeks. Both times we had a lovely meal.The eggs are amazing no matter what you order. We tried the omelette, croque madame, poached eggs. pastas are delicious too. We tried the aglio olio and Mac and cheese. I absolutely loved the french toast and double chocolate milkshake as well.Would definitely visit again.
3
The crab cake was nice and the spaghetti was good. The banana and nutella crepe could have been better. Instead of drizzling te chocolate syrup they could have drizzled the nutella instead cause the syrup kind of changed the taste. I really like how they decorate the table with your name for reservations. The staff were friendly. Slightly on the pricier side.
4
Very yummy food...love the mac-and-cheese (2 flavor 'version2 Mac n cheese royale' n 'old school baked Mac n cheese's we ordered n both tasted equally delicious),'rosario' fried risotto balls', 'lafayette crab cake'. The '280g chaegrilled strip steak' and 'american buttermilk fried chicken' taste nice too
5
You must try the Fish & Chips - the best in years, according to my wife.
My Crabby Devil, served with linguine and spicy tomato sauce was beautiful.
Strongly recommended
4
The mac and cheese with truffle was divine. The portions are quite large, so be prepared to share! The food was reasonably priced.
5
My family loved the food and ambience. The Mac & Cheese with truffle oil was so good, we ordered the 2nd time. It was a fanstatic dining experience with the family.
5
Not my first time here. Love the kinda Bueno milkshake and always coming back for it! Gotta do something to your risotto though, which we felt was a little too hard on the outside. Everything else is good!
5
2nd visit~ more convenient now since its just 2 mins walk away from Sixth Avenue downtown line!
Food and service is always consistent~ enjoyed the menu of the day - salmon with mashed potato, apple crumble and truffle fries. 😋
Will definitely return!
5
Food is great, service is great. Awesome dessert (banana choc )
Too little parking lots but that's not something the restaurant can do.
5
Every time I come here, the food and service never disappoint. Although this place may be a little loud , it's a wonderful place to meet friends .
4
First time trying out this cafe with a group of friends that have not met up for a while. Loved the location, the food was good, and the service expected. Thankfully my friends usually dont meet up too late, last order was at 9. If you need a place you gotta talk till late, probably have to hop over somewhere else
3
Crab cakes yummy. Fried chicken was awesome. Moist dark meat and fried perfectly and drizzled with just enough maple syrup :) Burger was done medium which I enjoy. Bread and butter pudding was disappointing. Service was excellent. Gotta love the souped up version of the Mac and Cheese. Best shared only cos it's a rich dish in a good portion
4
Wanted to try the American Buttermilk Fried Chicken on my first visit, but it was sold out. I managed to taste it on my second. Although it was stated that it had a preparation time of 20 minutes, I do noted that it was served to me less than 20 minutes. It was served piping hot with hand-cut fries and coleslaw, the taste is interesting and I love it! Highly recommended dish! :

Sunday lunch time crowd. A bit noisy but a nice cosy place. There is limited parking in front of the restaurant but there are more parking places around the corner. Near to MRT 6th Avenue station so it's convenient
4
Had a great experience here - my 2nd time. Food is cooked to perfection and service attentive. We had the version 2.0 mac and cheese and it was wonderful. Will def return of I'm in the area!
5
Super convenient location near MRT Sixth Avenue Station along the Downtown Line. The staff chopped/reserved a lovely table for us near the entrance which we liked. Food was beautifully plated and it tasted delicious. Homely decor and comfortable ambience. Definitely be back here again.

Lunch @ Little Diner was good. Service was good and attentive. Kids enjoyed the Mac and Cheese! Very nice ambience. Price is on high side but worth it.
5
Good vibes, good food, unpretentious, service was wonderful.
Went with my family and we all enjoyed ourselves!

It is a nicely decorated restaurant. Staff is also friendly. However, the food was not what we expected. We went on a Friday night and ordered from the Friday special menu. One of the dishes we ordered is beef stew. The beef was hard and from the description on the menu, I was looking forward to a colourful stew. However when it came, it was a dish of black stew with beef and bits of carrots. We also ordered the pan-fried salmon. At $27, I would expect more than a small piece of salmon on top of some mash potato and a few asparagus. Another thing that may require improvement is the way they serve water. One of the glasses of water that we were served was only a quarter filled. We asked for a replacement. Then after observation, we realised that there are 10-12 glasses cluttered together on the table-top. possibly collected after the customers have left. We started to wonder if the glass that was a quarter filled could have been taken from there by mistake. Overall, the price of the food is expensive in relation to the standard of the food. Most likely, will not visit again

The food was great overall. We ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, Aglio Olio King Prawns with bacon and Pan-fried seabass. The portion of the seabass can increase considering it is one of the most expensive item on the menu. The handcut fries that is part of the buttermilk fried chicken can be more crispy but the portion is generous. I liked the fact that they personalized the name of the person who made the reservation on a DIY card. I will recommend people to visit this restaurant. Location is convenient via Downtown line and it's a short 1 min walk from Sixth Avenue station. However, my friend got some mossie bites though so do consider having some mosquitoes repellent.

Non scribed no frill and lightly decorated place, you come here for the food, Charles and Mel and team took good care of us very well. Having eaten on numerous occasions the food has always been spot on, and for whiskies drinkers there is a good selection on offer. The prices are obviously reasonable charging also by the crowd they have on weekends. The crusted cheese melt over the pasta was very good. And so are the burgers. The truffle fries are a hot fav with me and my daughter. I like the wild mushroom soup as its a gamey taste to it. Water flows freely and it's free. Nice touch. They also have a 15min giant burger food challenge which is not on anymore. Overall you should enjoy and have spare change to go back even after heavy drinking as its 20ms from the sixth Ave mrt.

Atmosphere - Great, Cosy decor, little handwritten cards with your name written on it when you reserve a table. A touch of customisation is always great.Quality of Service - Good. Service staff were always looking around to see if anyone needed assistance and was very prompt and polite though the waiting time for our food was taking a bit too long.
4
nice ambience and great food. My wife and kids love the food and the sinful double chocolate milkshake. We will be back.
5
Living few streets away, I have always been wanting to visit and only got the chance to recently!
Love the friendly staffs, the food, even more - the price tag!!
We enjoyed our food so much we can't wait to be back soon!
3
I like that they have personalized place cards for guest who reserves the table. Mac and Cheese is great, otherwise other foods are average. The truffle fries was a little too oily for my liking.
5
The food is amazing as well. On weekends it gets crowded, so it's not a comfortable place for a long talk
5
Had my valentine's day dinner here and I just want to express my absolute delight at the food they served in here. The price is affordable and the quality of the food is top-notch. I'm a fussy eater and I thoroughly enjoyed eating here.
5
Amazing, top notch service. The first time I visited little diner, I was really impressed by their service. This time round (4th time) I was still impressed by their service & of course, the food. I made a reservation and a special request for the table & when I arrived, I was asked if the table given was alright. Also,Water is ALWAYS served immediately upon seated. We had the Bacon & Cheese Rissole ($9.50), version 2 Mac and cheese royale ($20.50), Shrooms & truffle burger ($22.5, but because its on a Tuesday- ALL burgers are $15++) and lastly the XXX Baconator ($21.5, $15++ on Tuesdays). The bacon & cheese Rissole was flavorful & not too creamy. HIGHLY recommend the Version 2 Mac and Cheese Royale if you're a truffle Mac and cheese fan! Burgers are amazingly done (extremely thick patty, yums!). Definitely coming back again
4
Good ambiance and the service staffs were extremely kind, and helpful. However, the wait for the food was longer than expected but still acceptable. Food was a little disappointing. We ordered the XXX Baconator and the truffle burgers and the patties came out a little dry and overcooked, but the serving was generous and the fries were great. Overall, I'd come back for the atmosphere but maybe order something else
3
Went there to celebrate my 3rd year anniversary. Food wasnt up to expectations despite reading reviews online. Tried the buttermilk fried chicken and it wasn't that fantastic. However, the milkshakes wasn't disappointing at all.We ordered cookies and cream milkshake as well as the kinder bueno one.Both of us agreed that the kinder bueno was the best of all!Overall, it was a pleasant dinner but I think I would only be back for the milkshake >
3
Table reserved to avoid disappointment. Menu not so much choices and there is no kid menu provided. Husband and friend choose the chef's recommendation (The BBQ PigWich and The XXX Baconator). Myself and another gal friend pick American Buttermilk Chicken.All meal come with coleslaw and fries.Fries too salty. Coleslaw is tasty and we did love it. Risotto balls was great taste! Not a good place for long conversation
2
This is a first time to diner for 4 of us. We were looking forward to the place as the reviews are mostly good. The place is nice to chill as the ambience is nice and personalised. Your name will be written at the table that is reserved for you. This is a plus point. However, the food is not worth the price at all. The fries are soggy, the food are generally bland. The side: roasted aparagus is pathetic looking, can't even pick up with a fork as it is too shrunken
4
Went here for a later Saturday Lunch and booked a table upfront as the restaurant closes down between lunch and dinner. We had a roasted beef sandwich and the crab cake sandwich. The roasted beef was very nice, juicy and tender.
5
Svs good, food was great.
The baconater was really really yummy.
It gets a tat crowded, thus noisy and there is a queue for the loo sometimes
but still great. Happy hour till 730!
5
Food was great and came quite fast. Nice interior decor too. Suggest to gave more light bites for sharing
5
Atmosphere and the service were excellent. Good crowd on a Friday night, pleasant dinner experience.
5
Confirmation of reservation was quick! Lucky we made a reservation as the place was full even on weekdays evening. The food was reasonable and the staff help to customize our birthday wordings for the bday girl!
2
Food is oily and portion is small. Not value for money. In addition, the oil used isn't that fresh..
5
Love the great crew with fantastic service! Best place to go for a small gathering, never fails to disappoint, be it food or service!
5
Food is great, restaurant even have the thought of having to write on the card when you made reservation. Thank u!!! :)
5
Parking space is limited, but the restaurant is now easily accessible via the downtown line. Absolutely love the mac and cheese which resembles fluffy cloud and tastes like marshmallows! Definitely recommend those looking for a cozy place to have some yummy and hearty food for a decent price
4
This would be my second visit and we remembered to bring along a chair pad for my elderly relative to sit on. Love the risotto balls and apple crumble. Prime roast was large and tender, as was the generous 280g strip sirloin steak with mashed potatoes. The battered fish came in two large thick pieces done perfectly. Unfortunately the hand cut potato chips are best used to drain the battered fish. Service was prompt and cheerful : )Our party of three were done and happily replete and out the door in an hour
4
We had a nice dinner at Little Diner. For main course, we had lamb shank and sea bass which are both good. Go for their Granny's bread pudding for dessert.
5
Delicious food. Had Croque Madame and Mac & cheese ver2. My friend had the burger and it was delicious too.
5
The food was fabulous. Service was great. Overall a very memorable experience. Will definitely come again.
4
Very good burgers in a restaurant with a good ambience. Great staff and service. Family favourite and one we take most visitors to.
5
Have been here the second time and glad to see that their standard of food is consistent. It is still as nice as before.
5
The food was good and so was the ambience. They did not rush us and everybody had a good time.
Recommended.
4
All the food were good with fair portion. The staff was also very helpful. However, the location was quite remote and far from crowd but it was worth for the meals that we had.
5
Had v.2 truffle mac & cheese and beef stew. Good for sharing cos they are gelat. So yummy!! Service was awesome too. Just that it gets kinda noisy.
5
Don't miss this place. My family and I have been here dozens of times over the last few years and always enjoy the food and the service. It's a cozy place that also offers 2 small tables outside (we always bring our dog, sit outside and he is treated like a guest). The food is very tasty, meat and fish always cooked perfectly (medium rare when appropriate) and all the meals come out on time and at the same time. Nice size portions. Reasonably priced wines. If you sit outside, the road noise can be distracting but the friendly service definitely makes up for it. For a meal that tastes home cooked and special, come here. You won't regret it
2
Was recommended by a colleague about this place. Came with great expectation but was disappointed. Mushroom soup was served lukewarm, not much mushroom in it. Truffles fries was also warm rather than hot, and not crispy. The steak was not juicy even though it was supposed to be cooked medium, and the fish and chip was over fried (too brown, rather than golden)
5
You have to try their version 2.0 mac and cheese! Everything goes above and beyond your expectations, unfortunately this includes the price...
4
Ordered the wagyu beef burger, crabcakes and kinder Bueno milkshake. All awesome and worth coming back for.
4
Good food.. buttermilk chicken was great.. honey paired with the crispy fried chicken.. risotto balls was wonderful and the tomato pasta sauce was a great touch.. I will also recommend the double chocolate milkshake.. just the right degree of thickness.. parking may be difficult though..

This is my first visit to this restaurant. And whilst I enjoyed the food - I had the pasta set lunch, I think you should not advertised this place as an "Affordable American-sized portion" because the serving is definitely not American-size portion and you might give people, especially first time visitors, the wrong idea. Whilst the serving portion for my crabmeat pasta was just nice for me, my friend who had the classic burger was smaller than expected. A few other friends who ordered the fish, it was also just the normal "Singaporean size portion". And when it came to billing time, we notice that we were charged the normal rate for the desserts that we have ordered rather than the special "top up" rate of $4++ if we order the lunch set. We brought it up to the staff and they quickly amended it. Then, when we got back to office, I realised that besides charging us wrongly for the dessert, apparently, there was a mistake with our drinks order as well. Whilst majority of the group took the coffee and tea that is included in the set, couple of them took the drinks top up rate of $1.50 or something for the lime juice and flat white (both not part of the set deal). But it was too late to go back to the restaurant by then.So on the whole our dining experience would have been better if not for the hiccups. That's why I am giving it a rating of 3.5 to 4. The food was good and service was not bad.
5
Every review is based on individual perception and this review of mine started positively when I managed to "chope" a parking lot easily.Little diner prepared the reservation in a piece of beautifully hand-written note with you name. You will be served by the friendly staff who makes you really comfortable. The food is kind of special, kind of fine dining experience and taste awesome.I do noticed other customers enjoying their extremely large burger and will definitely visit Little Diner again in the near future
5
The Little Diner has been a favourite of ours since we've moved to Singapore. The food, ambience, craft beers, mimosa's and coffee - all out of this world! The fact that it is a tiny space, makes it feel like you are visiting friends. Love The Little Diner
4
Finally, a place that can do bacon properly! Nicely crisp slices of bacon although I wish they had some hash brown thrown in. The ice flat white tasted off though. It had a sour tinge to it. It's hard to find a good ice latte or flat white in Singapore unfortunately.The mac and cheese is done pretty well although a tad heavy on the truffle oil for my liking. Perhaps good for those who love the truffle oil flavor but I will suggest the dish as a shared item. Overall a good experience with friendly staff.
5
Definitely my fav diner in singapore. First time I tried the truffle Mac and cheese 3 years back, it trumped every other one Mac and cheese in sg. 3 years on and its still the top of my list. Good portions and worth the price for each dish delivers quality and quantity. The tiger prawn pasta has a slight but flavourful broth while the buttermilk chicken with maple sauce is crisp and tasty without being too jelat. This is the first time I'm leaving a review for a restaurant because it is THAT good. Have been going back occasionally over the years and will keep visiting it as long as its around :
4
This restaurant has very marvelous Truffle Mac & Cheese! We cant help but had 2 servings of that. We also had the Truffle fries, buttermilk fried chicken, crabcakes, risotto balls and seafood aglio olio! The fried chicken was very juicy and has a unique combination of butter milk and maple syrup! Meat was very tender. Tasted great! Risotto balls were also another unique small bites which were very cheesy and flavorful. The crabcakes and seafood aglio olio were average and werent as good as we thought. Oh and the staff immediately served us water the moment we sat down. No charges of coz :) Lastly the staffs were all with smiles and friendly to customers. Just a pity that we didnt try the desserts as we already have a birthday cake. Do visit this place for dinner if you really like cheese, truffle and fried chicken
2
While the food was passable and the waitresses polite enough, it took 30 minutes for them to serve 4 cups of coffee, and an hour to serve 3 main meals. As it was my mother's 60th birthday, the wait took the joy out of any celebratory mood we might have had. On top of that, they miscalculated our bill and charged us twice for the mains, even though they were the ones who forgot our orders. Probably the first and last time we will dine there.
4
Nice ambiance.
Great food, especially their buttermilk fried chicken.
Pricing are reasonable.
Staffs were really attentive.
Great place to chilll/hangout/dinner with friends & families.
4
Food is very yummy. We had the pigwich and steak. Ambience is also perfect. Will definitely come back again
5
This is a really great diner. The menu is full of yummy US style comfort food that's prepared to perfection. I love their burgers.
5
excellent service and food is out of our initial expectation. has initially requested to change a certain bread to another one, however, staff came forward to let us know of the consequences which we doubt we are able to find such services elsewhere.
5
We really enjoyed our meal here, the burgers were big and tasty and the atmosphere is very relaxed. The price is very reasonable too, we'll definitely go back!
4
The food has not yet disappointed. The service is not amazing though. The waiters don't seem to know what you are asking for and don't communicate very well. We stopped there for dinner the other night around 6pm and they had half the restaurant with empty tables. We believe they were reserved for later 7-8pm. One waiter came up and asked us if we had made a reservation and we said 'no'. Then he just walked away and another waitress came up and asked us the same thing and how many of us (there were 2 of us standing there)...and then she scrunched up her face and looked around the restaurant at the half empty tables and said..."umm....hmmm...ummm....sorry....no tables." We found that very odd and unpleasant and have decided we may not go back there for a while even though the good is great, the service has put us off.
5
We went to dinner for the 1st time yesterday and had an outstanding meal. Reservations were a MUST. I ordered the pan seared sea bass, with mashed potatoes and veg. It was one of the best fish entrees I have had in all of Singapore... I'm not kidding. It was tender, moist and flavorful. No nasty overpowering fishiness. The french fries my son had were fresh cut and delicious!!
4
Went there with our two boys and all had a wonderful dinner for "reaturant week" - great options to choose from and good service. The food was very tasteful. Like the diner ambiance, but still with healthy options. Have been a few times for luch which was very good as well
4
Past by this place numerous times and always wanted to try. Booked thru chope reservations. Service was excellent. Food was good. Enjoyed the truffle fries and dessert - chocolate pot mousse. Kids love the dinosaurs shaped nuggets. Mac and cheese was a bit too cheesy for our taste though. Overall wonderful experience.
4
Not only do they serve great selection of food, they provide good service too even during reservation. I received an efficient acknowledgement and response to my query regarding seating arrangement upon my reservation a week before the actual appointment. It was my second time to visit the place and I am glad to have brought my colleagues there on the second visit. They all love the food we ordered. The selection are just of the right servings and the food are superbâ€¦ especially the very rich mac & cheese
4
We were pleasantly surprised, 2 families with kids 10 to 13. Food was delicious and prices decent. Will be back again for sure. Keep up the prompt service.
5
Had a dinner date with my girlfriend, we both enjoyed the food. Service was amazing, and the environment kept you in place. I wouldn't mind going back at all!
5
We found this place via Chope when I was looking for some casual dining options. The food was really good - check out the mac and cheese! The beer selection is great. The service was a real standout. We will definitely be back.
5
What a place. The food is to die for. Impeccable service. Always served hot. Now our regular. Try the Epic breakfast platter on a Sunday morning.
5
Fantastic. Food cooked and presented beautifully. Menu varied and excellent. Staff and service perfect, friendly, thoughtfully efficient.
4
Really friendly staff, treat everyone like friends or family. Food is comfort style, a bit heavy, but really well made and delicious. Though not in the hustle & bustle of Singapore city it is a great place to dine if you're in the neighborhood.
3
Was initially pleasantly surprised -good ambience, highly attentive service, good portions (pulled pork sandwich was good) but all terribly marred by what I suspect was curdled dairy used to cook the kids meal pasta marinara. Kids were hurling all night long and we we cleaning puke from very sick kids all weekend! Something you'd not expect in terms of hygiene, especially so for kids' meals! Sorely disappointed and whilst I might have recommended this place, I will now avoid due to poor hygiene
4
The service was excellent and the beers were interesting. The staff had a good understanding of the craft beers they serve. The food was good too. Unfortunately, some patrons decided to smoke just outside the main door and the patrons seating by the main door had to endure second hand smoke... otherwise the overall rating and the atmosphere would have been excellent!
4
Had the calamari starter, burger and mac n cheese for mains, and bread butter pudding for dessert. Everything was spot on! And probably one of the best mac n cheese I've had in a while. The wait staff were very friendly and helpful. Service is efficient. Overall a great experience and I'm looking forward to my next visit
5
Need some comfort food?This place not only has really good service, but I must say for Singapore's service standard, the service you get here is very sincere and personalised. From table reservations, to the owner who will delightfully greet you and kindly explain the specials and make good recommendations, I will definitely return here!
