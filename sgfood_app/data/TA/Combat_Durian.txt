A little expensive but you're sure that they'll only give you what you like. We started with a bitter Mao Shan Wan followed by a sweet one. Not disappointed at all. We can see why it's crowded all the time late into the night.

After having durian elsewhere, even jackfruit smells like it. However, happy to enjoy jackfruit again without trouble. Durian is a must have but not easy to have.

We have been going to Combat Durian consistently this season. The durians never disappoints. You pay for good service, good fruit and they look after their customers. My brother in law packs them and bring themBack to Hong Kong. They are individually wrapped in Glad wrap n then put in a Tupperware container. It is then put into a foil bag and then packed into a box. This box is then wrapped in brown paper carefully and then string tied. it comes in small or large box. We have been back twice as it is consistently good. We will be back for more ...

I remember when I was a child and my parents let me try durian for the first time. I absolutely hated it. Didn’t like anything about it, the taste, the smell, the texture and the way it looked. I have avoided this fruit ever since then. Now some 25 years later, I thought I would give it another try since I was in Singapore. Perhaps my palette has changed? There must be something about the fruit which explains why so many people like it, especially in Singapore.After much research, I opted for Combat Durian. It was a 40 minute bus journey for me costing $1.80 from China Town. A bit out the way but there was going to be no better opportunity. Once there, I specifically looked for one of the older workers there for assistance. Having read reviews on TA, some of the younger ones are not helpful and may even be dishonest in selecting and preparing the fruit for you: overcharge or give you a bad Durian because you don’t know any better. From what I saw there, I think there is some truth in it. The young workers I saw were definitely not as friendly or appear as helpful. They have various types of durians there. Some they have prepared and packaged already and others they prepare for you there and then and even give you a taste. The smallest Durian the older gentlemen could find for me came to $20, about a kilo in weight. I told him I was not sure I would like it and didn’t want to waste any. As a result, he cut one open for me and gave me a whole piece. Charged me $3 for it, very cheap. He definitely did me a favour there. I know for a fact non of the young ones would have bothered doing this for me. It wouldn’t be worth their time considering how busy the place was whilst I was there. So many locals stopping by to get their Durian fix after work. I loved it. It was sweet, creamy, yet the outer skin was just a tad firm. As a result, I went to look for a cash machine (the place only accepts cash) so that I had enough money to buy some more. I bought another $20 worth and sat down at one their tables. Water is provided for free, although there is a lady which comes around asking if you wanted to buy some coconuts juice. There are plastic gloves provided if you wish to use them and also a sink to wash your hands. I am so glad I made this little trip out of town and give this controversial fruit a try. If you have had a bad experience in the past, perhaps it was the type of Durian or that it just was not fresh. Give it another go here, you might change your mind like I did. As for the smell, I even quite like that too as well now. So, my tip if you are a tourist is to seek out the older workers (40+ years old) to assist you. The person who helped me seemed honest and he genuinely did not want me to waste my money. Even when I returned with more cash to buy more, he double checked to see if I was sure and carefully selected the ones which he thought I would like. He chose the sweeter ones to ease me into this new found love for the fruit

I’ve been a regular to this place whenever I crave for durian. Always selling good quality durian with reasonable price. Very honest about the quality. This is the only place which can pack durian without any smell leaking so I can always fly it with me to Jakarta. Linda, the owner always letting me know if new stock of durian I like is available.

Since we felt during our first visit that the place was over hyped. This time round, we were 'desperate' since, our usual place have very bad durian. We tried the red prawn, sweet with a tint of bitterness. It was very good. And also very expensive. Everyone is a regular here, so you'll feel very welcome

I have tried all kinds of durians in Singapore and from many stalls.My favourite is still Combat Durians. Linda the proprietress is honest about the quality of her durians.She has expanded her father's business. There were 6 persons serving customers at the stall tonight compared to the 3 during her father's time.Service is good and efficient.They provide plastic gloves although I don't understand why anyone would use them. Durians should be finger licking good. They also provide boxes of tissues and there is a sink with liquid soap at the back for you to wash your hands when you eat at the stall.They have many tables and chairs around the stall.Limited parking nearby by the side of the temple along Balestier Road

Combat durian is pretty famous for Malaysian durian lovers, especially for MSW (Mau San Wang / Musang King) type. The first durian that we had was very good, but the second one apparently just average quality (far below quality of the first one, not as sweet and fresh).What really annoying was when comes to payment. The staffs insists that the weight of the first durian was 2.2 Kg while I saw it myself during weighing it's only around 1.7 Kg, very2 bad and not trustworthy- make sure to record it directly during weighing process and force them to say it in English!Pricing is high compared to other durian players, and with poor service like this I wouldn't recommend this place, especially if you're not a Durian expert or do not speak Chinese.

Excellent quality durian but not cheap and the service is both efficient and polite. I would recommend that you eat the durian at the shop as the facilities is well equipped. There are several tables with chairs, plastic gloves, washing facilities as well as drinks and fresh coconut drink.Will be back for the next durian fix

Eveytime I go to Singapore, I always go to Combat Durian. Musang King Durian is still the best ever. It's creamy butter, sweet and a bit bitter. When the season comes, you have to que.

One must brave super long queues during the fruit's season, but the wait is worth it. Very good stock of Raja Kunyit, aka Mao Shan Wong, plus other varietals.

Loves all types of Durian eg. Mau Sang Wang Durian and Sultan King Bitter Durian. Don't forget to try Mangoesteen. It was awesome.

I've been a regular to this place to have durian. Today I had the bitter flat seed durian. Amazing taste and texture. I spent $60 for a medium size durian, money really worth spending. Linda Ang, the owner was there when we were there. A must try if you like durian

We found this place open as we were looking for Lor Kee chicken rice. As we drove pass in the car we could smell the waft of the ever smelling durian even with the windows up .. so dessert was sorted after we had our fill of chicken rice . Parking was hard to find on the street so we eventually parked at Shaw building . Had our first taste of red prawn durian .. for me the flesh was smooth, silky n creamy n sweet with a tinge of rose. A small durian of red prawn cost $12 with about 8 seeds. Then not contented we tried the king of kings.. it was good, not as sweet with a tinge of bitterness. It's more expensive at $35 With 9 seeds. Service was good with free flow bottled water n fuss free seating. This lot of durian will last3 weeks! Now bring on July 2017 for the Mu Sang durians .

We came here after watching a Mark Wiens youtube video. Durian is a fruit to be feared if you believe some of what we'd heard prior to heading to Combat Durian.....durians are banned on public transport and in hotels. It was recommended that we try a MSW durian......it cost $32 and was worth every cent. No smell. A slight onion taste at the beginning....then it tastes like a combination of every tropical fruit you've ever tasted. Grab some a fresh coconut at the same time....you will not be disappointed.It's a unique experience that I cannot wait to have again

Easy to spot with the large banner in front of the stall. You cannot miss it, it is next to a Chinese temple.Came with a group of 11 folks for Durian feast and selected 11 fruits to share - Maoshan, King of Kings, Red Prawn etc. Pricing is reasonable and we were seated quite fast. Had coconut drink to quench the "heat" of the Durians. They served us our durians rather quickly, so service was fast.Seating in a covered area, so sheltered from the elements though it looks makeshift. Long crowds queue to order on the go as well as eating in. Come early, it fills up by 4pm. Best to come via taxi or bus as there is no place to park. Better to park elsewhere and come here via public transport. The office building next to the temple also has a carpark but it could be full

I've been here several times and ordered to deliver durians to some friends in Singapore too. They even can send durian to Jakarta in a special packaging so it won't leaks the durian smell. They also provide a whatsapp notification when the new durian arrived. Sometimes they also have a long queues when the good durian is there with special discounted price

The durian season usually starts in end July, peaks in August and ends towards early September. If you are visiting Singapore in August, you are in luck.Combat Durian is a famous durian stall in Singapore and has been visited by local and foreign celebrities alike. Here's why.1. LocationIt is housed on the edge of a Chinese temple along Balestier Road, one of the well-known places for street eats. Balestier Road is pretty central and easy to get to. Many bus routes lie along this road and there are plenty of taxis. For those who drive, there is ample parking in Rocca Balestier, a building next to the stall. There are big signboards that direct you to Rocca Balestier. Outdoor seats are provided for eating in. There are taps and sinks to wash your hands after eating durians. Tissue paper and wet towels are also provided.2. QualityThis stall gets its supply from Malaysia. There is a wide variety of durians to choose from. King of Kings, Mao Shan Wang, Golden Phoenix, Red Prawn, D24, XO... Don't get distracted. Just go for King of Kings. If it is sold out, then ask for Mao Shan Wang. King of Kings is the best so far. The seeds are tiny; the flesh is bitter-sweet, buttery and creamy; and the smell is very fragrant. Apart from durians, the stall also sells other fruits like mangosteens, lychees, pears, oranges and coconuts. Most people eat durians and drink coconut water because they go very well together.3. ServiceThe stall assistants are very friendly and eager to serve. Tell them your preference of taste and they will choose the correct durians. They will offer the durians for taste check so don't be shy to reject any durian if the taste doesn't suit you. For takeaway, you can decide to keep the durians in the husk or have the assistant pack the durian into sealed foam boxes.4. PriceDurians are charged by weight (inclusive of the husk). In recent years, the prices of durians have reduced because supply has been plentiful. King of Kings can be purchased at $20 to $25 per kg from Combat Durian. Compared to stalls in Geylang, this price range is very reasonable.For me, Combat Durian is really the best. Some will say there are other stalls that sell better durians and I may agree. But few can beat Combat Durian for what it delivers in value-for-money

The store took my call and advised me to park at the gantry car park in the building before the temple it's installed at. It is easy to miss. The language spoken here is mainly English and Chinese/Mandarin. If you have trouble, the staff will help you the best they can to buy the good stuff (even though they can be pushy!) The storekeep was warm towards my friend and advised me to go with a Mao Shang Wan.Do not be fooled by the styrofoam boxes served. The portion is not that deep and most of it is resting on padding. It is probably a good idea if you don't want to have too much to eat at a go (Durian is a potent 'heaty' food after all). If you want to dine on the fruit, go for the actual durian fruit itself.The fruit we had was great, not watery like most negative reviews of this place. The free flow of packet water helped a lot too, when the mangosteen ran out. Fresh coconuts were served too
