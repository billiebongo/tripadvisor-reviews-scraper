The wagyu not exactly marbled bit other than that quality of food quite good. Staff was attentive and ambience is good. This is my 2nd visit, the first was when they are still near Jurong Birdpark. Will come again

Nice place, ambience, quality of food is good. Negative is the location of restaurant, parking. It's fried food is not attractive and seems oily.
Love it's matcha ice cream!

We went to the Tiger Balm gardens and needed lunch beforehand, there's no food outlets on-site so after a little hunting around we found this place inside a sort of office mall. It's small, not flashy, but does quite a big range of Asian food and they were very accommodating. The portions are huge and the prices small, but you do get charged for the extras like the wet wipes

The restaurant is now at Westway and it is house together with Ju Shin Jung, so it seems that there is some competition for lunch. I had tried that and so I tried Shiu as well. Shiu is not very Japanese although it does give you the impression it is. It is more like a localized fusion of everything. But that is not a bad thing either. Instead of the buffer, we had Ala carte and it seems like it is pretty cheap even for that. The damage is about $10+ and you really have a full meal. I would definitely come back, but the entrance is a bit all the way in, so you really have to know that this restaurant exists before going in... which is a pity

We were visiting Haw Par Villa and decided to have lunch here, after checking some suggestions found on the net.We were not disappointed at all!!The food was delicious (OMG, duck was AMAZING), the staff definitely lovely and the place is very nice and cozy, out of the touristy area.We had lunch a bit later than usual (around 13:30) so we were the only 2 people in the restaurant (a bigger crowd was eating here around 1 hour before, when we passed by to check the place before reading the reviews ;) - I guess they were all having a short lunch break before going back to the office) and the staff was so patient, caring and kind to us. We are european so we did not know some of the sauces and the waiters helped us chose and match for a truly amazing food experience

Hi Guys, this restaurant has moved from Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim to 27 West Coast Highway #01-11 Singapore 117867. You can save lots if you download "EATIGO" app and make a reservation before turning up for the buffet lunch or dinner! Not very wide range of variety for standard buffet but definitely "CHEAP"! You can upgrade to Premium buffet if you are feeling richer.

~been back 3 times & still all good, drive towards Jurong Bird Park and park next to the coach entrance. The building is named The Village @ Jurong Hill and you'd be able to see it from the slip road (u gotta get off the expressway towards Tuas)~if you're having the Yakiniku, you'll be seated at the tables with holes for the hot plates~Dinner service is laid back, kinda like visiting a B&B, it's not great but's friendly and attentive. Lunch service is really thin so if it's busy you gotta wait a bit~the food that's served is exactly what's described in the menu, you get what you pay for and it's not bad or great, definitely not shortchanged yet it's kinda yummy ~Teppanyaki is seasoned well and flavorful!I'll keep this for a family dinner once a while :
