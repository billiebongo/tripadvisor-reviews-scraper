Good spot. Handy if all you want is a coffee and snacks etc. after being on the hoof all day. At $30 for 2 coffees and two deserts it was reasonably priced as well
5
Greate coffee here. 8 dollars for the creative 5. If ou like Vietnamese coffee, you will like this place

plenty of good coffee in Singapore so this isn't that special. but if you're missing your VN style coffee, this is it. good service decent food. not a bad place to hang out. free wifi for the win!

Came here for a short coffee break. My friend told me that this is a very popular brand in Vietnam and USA.
Tip: WIFI code is on the receipt

Place was empty the few times I passed by and also the time I went in to try. Coffee tasted average and the place is just too small to have any coziness to it.

Takes 20mins for sandwiches . Expect to wait . Nice ice coffee . Poorly trained staff I'm afraid. Perhaps it's just bad timing but it's also not crowded

I love coffee and I chose Trung Nguyen coffee when i came Singapore. ( I drank Trung Nguyen coffee in Can Tho - Vietnam). delicious coffee is like the smell and taste in Vietnam. it's great for me
5
Love the vietnamese Drip coffee . Not the first time here.
Highly recommended for those whom enjoy strong aroma and thick coffee blend.

Trung Nguyen coffee has been very aggressive in their marketing drive; this accounts for their presence globally. There are a few good coffee Brands from VIETNAM, but due to lack of good promotion effort, they are left behind Trung Nguyen. This coffee outlet in SANDS serves reasonable good coffee, but at much higher price in view of their quality !!! Nothing very outstanding about this coffee, as there are many coffee outlets in SINGAPORE ABLE to give same if not better quality coffee at this price. Have a cuppa and judge for yourself

I love their coffee here. Hot or cold you will not be disappointed. They also hand out free samples so get a taste before committing to the big glasses. Food presentation is great but price. I took a roasted beef sandwich and it was terribly dry. Bread was a little too hard as well and I paid S$14 for it. I will just stick to the drinks the next time..

Its terrible that Trung Nguyen coffe serves by Singaporean. It should have been served by Vietnamese that would bring more feelings as its original taste. Ex: a black ice coffee order should be ask with sugar or no sugar as in VN

I ordered a garden salad and a ice coffee for S$6.90, so it was a good price. The salad is very recommendable. Friendly staff.

Went to the MBS outlet and the good coffee experience was completely spoiled by rude staff.. Also coffee was served cold

If you are wanting to try Vietnamese coffee without having to go to Vietnam this is the place to go. They have these little coffee shops all over Vietnam and the coffee is strong and good. Very SLOW drip!
2
The place is nice but the coffee of the day was awfull.
There is a wifi access inside the coffee which is a good thing!.....

Was so excited about this shop. tried this coffee in vietnam so it was great that its available in singapore as well. the coffee is terrific with different grade and strengths depending on your taste. served hot or cold and the sweetness can be adjusted too with condensed milk. yum

Just ordered 2 cups of undrinkable Creative 3 Iced Coffee. I love their coffee but something wasn't right when we ordered recently. I have never remember the taste so strong and odd we parted with the drinks after a few sips. Please kindly bring back the quality drink that Ive always loved. Thanks

If you like strong real coffee taste, this is a must visit! They serve 5 types of creative coffee varying from strong to ultra strong. They also serve normal coffee. Check the barista which style you should pick. It takes up to 8 minutes before the coffee is ready; enjoy the sit down. This coffee is not for the faint hearted people
5
If you like Vietnamese coffee, then stop by for a drink. They use the authentic slow drip style, very tasty, just like Vietnam! You can choose the type of beans you would like too, which is a bonus. It is expensive but what in Singapore isn't?! Worth it

We passed by Trung Nguyen to try some vietnamese drip coffee. I had "creation" drip coffee, which is the strongest option that is made from blending four coffee types - Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa, and Catimor beans. Have it iced with milk if you like cold coffee like me
3
Not my cup of tea if u know what I mean. The coffee has this sour after taste that I just cannot get a hang off.
4
I was a little uncertain that I was going to get a nice western style latte here but the staff provened more than capable. A great drop served quickly with a friendly smile. What more could you want!
4
We stopped for a Vietnamese coffee. Nice comfortable chairs. Small shop. Stronggggggg coffee.
Try itƒè

The drip coffee here is just like you get in Vietnam, with condensed milk.
The coffee is smooth and flavoursome.
5
my husband loved the coffee so much he bought some. partake in the eat in option to experience the whole process of coffee.

Pricey coffee gourmet coffee shop located in the Marina Bay Sands Mall. Service is ok since only 1 person was working when I stopped in. I tried the Creation with the four different coffee beans. It was pretty unique as the flavor changed as I was drinking it. Never had coffee like it before. The presentation took me a minute to understand as I usually get my coffee in a cup, not the apparatus and coffee beans on top of the cup. They do offer snacks and there some seating so it is a nice place to rest and relax before exploring the complex and surrounding area.

At mid-range price point, this is a decent place for a nice cuppa after lunch if you like.Decent, quiet sitting arrangement, with good Vietnamese Coffee, with each item on the menu available in Hot & Cold options. A good visit that I get to make at least 2-3 times a month

The coffee was actually quite good which seems difficult to come across in this country. However the staff who took my order spoke in a whispering voice and I could not understand a word of what she was saying. Seriously incompetant staff compared to the decent coffee. I have lived in 8 different countries and have friends that speak broken English that I have no problem understanding

Had gone to the branch at I12 katong Mall. A great alternative to the Cappuccinos & lattes, provides a good experience of a totally different coffee culture. The coffees are smooth and flavorful, quite an experience as the coffee drips out of your apparatus into the cup and you have to wait for 5 minutes or so before you can drink. The staff was eager to assist and inform about their product. A good place to keep going to time to time for a cuppa..

I was in Singapore for 2 weeks for a business trip and found myself stopping at Trung Nguyen Coffee many times. They have the traditional Vietnamese drip coffee served with condensed milk. It's about as close as I've had outside of Vietnam! They have 5 different versions with accurate descriptions on the board. I like strong coffee, so my personal favorite is Creation 4. My wife prefers less strong and she prefers Creation 2. If you feel like splurging, they have the Legendee option. It is coffee that has undergone the enzyme process to re-create the Kopi Luwak, the famous civit cat coffee (where the cat eats the bean and the excreted bean is used for brewing). I didn't try it, but it's unique, not the usual Starbucks or Coffee Bean offerings. They also serve pastries and desserts, but we never tried.I enjoyed the atmosphere of the coffee shop as they have lots of reading material to relax. The Marina Bay Sands wi-fi doesn't reach there, so it's not a good place to relax and try and get online with the local wi-fi. I liked that it was quiet, there were always people but it's not packed. The service was always excellent and I saw the staff guiding people who are new to drip coffee and how to take off the filter when it's ready.I highly recommend trying Trung Nguyen. It's located on the 3rd floor kind of out of the way from the rest of the mall. But it's worth the effort
