the staff at the restaurant was friendly and courteous. Do not hesitate to ask for their recommendation for the dishes. Most of the time it was very good. Certain dishes were a bit too salty so you might have to inform the chef to go easy with the salt.Overall it is a fantastic restaurant.

The pastry of the xiao long bao stuck to the paper so all broke apart and lost the soup.Har cheong was flat and lacking in soy sauce. We had to ask for more and when the second pour happened, it seemed to drown the rolls. It was a really disappointing experience for a tunglok restaurant.

A friend invited us to Tunglok Signatures for her birthday celebration last Friday. The menu is made up of mostly special dishes that I have not tried elsewhere and the service by Candy is superb. She was so professional in her photo and video taking for all of us and kept us very well taken care of.However, I heard the menu cost about $2000+ for a table of 12 pax and the cost is by per pax

I had many Loh Hei lunches in my stay in Asia but this was clearly one of the best. The quality of all the food was outstanding and they even prepared a video from the lunch. What a nice idea. We Abelone baked in clay, Australian King crab and birds nest for desert....it was a complete feast

Arrived into Singapore this afternoon. Took the family out to dine here to check out the venue for a reception. The service is one of the worst I had encountered in Singapore. The management staff was appalling. Food was average. Ordered 2 beers to start with & one of the glasses had debris "swimming" inside the glass. Advised the waitress about it & took her more than 15 minutes to get a new clean glass. Asked for the wine menu, once again I had to ask numerous times before getting it. Food was average, nothing to rave about. The staff were not attentive at all. Everything had to be asked numerous times before getting it.We were there as a family to check the venue for a reception we are holding in Singapore at the end of the year. Have to say even with recommendations from locals, this venue and the entire Tung Lok Group is eliminated from our list. Will not recommend to friends living in or visiting Singapore.

I am always a fan of Tung Lok and this restaurant at orchard parade hotel did not disappoint. I went to the restaurant for the lobster but it was a pity the Australian lobster needs to be pre-ordered - they could have mentioned it in the online menu. So we ordered local lobster cooked in two ways, herbal soup, dong po meat with buns and stir fry French beans and eggplant. Food is good, portion is enough. Wine list is short but found the one we like. Service is very good. Restaurant location is a bit out of the way though. The setting is bright, would have liked it to be more cosy. Overall a nice place to have good quality food and spend a nice evening

The restaurant is inside a hotel and not easily seen from the street level. I was invited for a dinner at a private function room. The food was quiet special. 6 courses with crab, seafood, duck, exotic meat and dessert. Every dish was carefully crafted and well presented. I like the dessert - chilled mango with pomelo, sago and sobert served in a coconut. The appearance of the dessert just made you feel cool. Service was good. The captain was very entertaining and explained all the dishes in details. A very interesting fine dinning experience

Had dinner with relatives over a few dishes such as Seasoned Black Fungus as entree, Foie Gras, Peking Duck, Curry Prawn, Vermicelli, Chinese Cabbage with Dried Shrimps and Durian with Pulut Hitam & Ice Cream in a coconut as dessert.The food overall I think is good. My highlight for the night is the Foie Gras which is the first time I have tasted one in my life. The fatty liver tastes smooth with the right amount of fat inside the mouth. Hard to describe in words.The dessert is an interesting combination with the durian on top of the pulut hitam and ice cream. Filling after having finished other dishes prior.The staffs on the floor are polite however need to be called a couple of times for certain attention for the table.Place is neat overall. Acceptable being clean enough but I notice a bit of dried food scrap on one of the fork being used on the table for the night
