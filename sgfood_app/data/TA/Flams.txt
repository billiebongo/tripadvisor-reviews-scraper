This is a new pizza restaurant located at one corner of a not so crowded shopping centre along the busy Orchard Road. Went there after a friend recommended. The pizza was superb and the service was great. If you are the adventurous, try ther goat cheese pizza. It's one of the highly recommended pizza in their menu

OMG - I want a franchise to open in Sydney or get the franchise myself!!!! The french style pizzas are wonderful - i had the bacon, goat cheese and honey one and was dumfounded by the taste - fantastic. The service was great, but being in a very large shopping complex there is little or no atmosphere, however the food makes up for it. It is licenced and the German beer is expensive but goes down really well with the food. We had entree and main and could not fit in dessert which was a shame as we had already decided on which one we were going to have..
