I paid twice what I would pay in starbucks for an iced latte that was watered down. they had a only a few different desserts that were not labeled or priced. There were no macaroons for sale.

Expensive.... Not too sure what the fuss is about! Came here because it was so highly rated. Dessert and drinks were nice but expensive.

Oh no! Not just the Dragon's breath snacks!! The ambience is great, with very good live music ( went on Thursday night at past 9- missed the happy hour :() I tried the premium cocktail- mojito and it was well prepared. Also, the house red wine was good! Staff was very friendly and attentive. That's my 1st Kampong Glam night out solo!Thumbs up and will be back again

Tiger small bottles were $10++ for one. Obviously cheaper if you buy more at once.I would give a "Good" rating as the guys were nice and invited us in during a rainstorm with no obligation to buy. But trip advisor doesn't offer that option.I would recommend but it is not the best place even on the street, shop aroun

An awesome place to unwind after a days work, and also a good spot in haji lane to hang out, desserts that will make you wanting for more, DJs from the DJ school above, play music on the weekends from 8pm to 12midnight. definitely a place to be at

I was mesmerized with my visit here. The lane itself, which this place is in, is fantastic. The perfect time to visit is after sunset.I sat here with this relaxing atmosphere, absolutely fantastic cakes and finger foods.We sat outdoor and they had this projector showing tv on the neighbouring walls which I think is really cool.Try it for yourself, and you will see what I mean..

kiler pastries, cool attitude in a really quirky street in the muslim quarter - worth the walk !, but your wallet will be lighter on the way back :-) TIP - it's not on the menu but if you ask them nicely they will make you an iced espresso also

Small place located on Hajji Lane but serves the most delicious desert in town. The raspberry cheesecake, the macaroons were amazing. Their coffee was one of the best I had. Highly recommended for anyone vising Singapore

Tried this place after a friend recommended, but won't go back after seeing 2 big cockroaches running around and then hiding behind the chiller. The chocolate shere was good, but the coffee was not bland. Concerned about cleanliness.

Have less than a day transit in S'pore...willing to walk in circle searching for this place for an hour or so, and it was WORTH IT. The richness in flavour and its exclusivity make me wanna come visit next time (:
5
We had ice tea and ice coffee which were great, but the madeleines.... The best we have ever tasted. Straight out of the oven, served with ice cream, lemon curd and berries. Delicious!
5
I ate a chocolate sphere, and it was so delicious. Staff is really nice and i have a real nice chat with the owner which is really nice

good desserts and well presented. only wish they had decent coffee. still a good experience and will be back.

Promising upcoming new cafe on the Haji lane front... This is one place worth visiting if your in the area!! Laidback ambience w chill music to boost, this makes the perfect place to hang out with your friends üëåüèª

Well presented and very scrumptious desserts. The service there was also very good, very efficient. The ambience is very relaxing. The desserts are delicious yet affordable :) One of my favorite desert shops in Singapore. I totally recommend this!

Make sure you pop by Le Kue for their desserts when you're in the vicinity. Their Le Sphere "Chocolate Ball" was soooo good, I'm so having it again when I revisit. Yum!!
5
Yes, that was my first thought when i tried the chocolate sphere! Had strawberry shortcake too. Both dessert are light and not gelat. Nice iced tea and ginger beer you got there!
