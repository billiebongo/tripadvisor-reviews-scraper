We are big fans of the ImpTreas group, and like ALL their different brands, no month goes by without us visiting one of their outlets. I must say I am not a big amateur of steamboats especially in the hot Singapore weather, so this was our first visit since the restaurant opened. You can recognise the Imperial Treasure signature: understated and elegant décor, courteous and professional service. The food? It is high-end alright - lots of soup choices, high-quality ingredients, nice sauces - but it’s over-the-top for a steamboat restaurant, which at the end of the day is still a family or close-friend affair. It’s too pricey, a bit stiff, and after the meal you can still feel the MSG. At least, Haidilao is more fun. So, we’ll stick to ImpTreas Teochew, Peking Duck and Shanghai, or the simple Noodles & Congee.

It is recommended that you make a reservation as it gets full. Hot pot is the way to go if you want to give your gut a rest from overeating in Singapore.

first time here for a birthday lunch, the quality of food here is good, the ingredients are fresh, and the service is prompt and friendly. its quite pricey though, cost us about S$250 odd for 2pax, and there were only 2 meats in our order

The restaurant is certainly decorated as a fine dining restaurant. We were guided to a private booth and given the menu which carried an extensive list of ingredients you can order for your steamboat.The server came with a tray with sauces and condiments. You are expected to come up with your own concoction of sauces from a selection of 12. Choose from peanut sauce, green and red chills, spring onion, plum sauce, chopped garlic, sambal chili and chicken rice chili, ginger, pickles, coriander etc.You choose from an extensive list of soup bases - from the usual chicken soup base, ginseng chicken, satay, tomato and potato, kelp to Sichuan spicy soup. We chose the big bone soup which came with a huge bone (what else?!). The broth was rich, thick and very sweet! Super tasty. It was really good as the broth was simmered for hours to bring out the sweetness of the meat.Note: the soup base is not free - expect to pay anything between $17 and $68 just for the soup.Service was superb - professional with heart. Plates were changed frequently and our soup was topped up before we could ask!!Order the mixed vegetable, Wagyu beef (by weight), fish (by weight with a minimum amount to be ordered), belly pork, meat balls, drunken chicken. The food quality was high, food was very fresh and came beautifully plated.The restaurant is very popular and reservations are recommended. We called on the day itself and only managed a seating at 8.30pm!Highly recommended. Be prepared to spend at least $50/pax. Our bill for 2 came up close to $200

Four of us spent more than S$700 for a steamboart dinner. The geoduck alone is about S$400. When commented casually could the restaurant at least gave us a cake as it was  a birthday celebration. The waitress went out to ask the manager and came back to say no.It is S$700 dinner for four and no complimentary desert

We were delighted that we got to select our sauces/ingredients when the waitress brought it to our table. As per other steamboat restaurant there were a few selection of soup base for the steamboat. The dishes were considered fresh but taste was quite average. Actually I was having high expectations for this restaurant since it's supposedly to be the 'high-end' one for the chain. Somehow, feeling disappointed since there aren't any special dish too. Probably will not patronise again since there are better steamboat that we have tried before

Group of overseas and local colleagues visit on 12 Oct for dinner. The next day discovered majority having stomach upset. Feedback to Imperial Treasure to check on their kitchen till now no reply.Never consider to bring my business clients or colleagues over to Ion Orchard outlet again.

The entire Imperial Treasure Group of restaurants is catering to the Chinese Fine Dinning clients. The resturant is popular, and booking is a must. The dinning hall is huge with round tables and cubicles. We knew they carry some of the most expensive ingredient and were careful to order the 'ordinary' vegetables, tofus, noodle, fish, fish paste, prawn & beef...and final bill was about S$65 per head. Corkage is $30 per bottle. Condiments is S$2.50 per head, with a lots of impressive variety. We had the half/half broth of pork and chicken, which are both fine, not outstanding. The only discomfort is six of us were cramped into a booth seat meant for four

Went to celebrate a good friend's birthday. The steamboat was excellent, although it comes with a price. The food were fresh and quality was good.

The restaurant was under the Imperial Treasure chain, and offered hotpot. It was considered one of the most atas outlet in Singapore to offer hotpot. There was also branch in Great World City. This outlet looked quite grand from the entrance. Reservation of 8 people was made a week ago. The staff called up about an hour before the reservation to confirm. The staff showed us to a private room with a great view of Orchard Road. The table was big with 2 induction stoves and could seat 10 pax comfortably. Most hotpot restaurant had sauce counter, but here the staff brought the tray of sauces which consisted of satay sauce, peanut sauce, sesame sauce, sesame seeds, chilli sauce, garlic chilli sauce, sliced green chilli, sliced red chilli, chopped coriander, deep fried chopped garlic, chopped garlic, chopped spring onion) to the table. Each person was charged $2.50++ for the sauces.For soup base, selected Imperial Drunken Chicken Soup ($28++) which tasted slightly bitter in the beginning but was quite flavourful. It came with a bowl of marinated chicken to add into the soup. The chicken was quite tender.Accompanied with the following :King Tiger Prawn ($18++/ 4pc) - served peeled, big and juicySliced Eel ($14++) - quite boneySquid ($10++)USA Sliced "Kurobuta" Pork Belly ($14++)Sliced Lamb Shoulder ($15++)Four Treasure Ball Platter ($14++/ 8pc) - Fresh Prawn Ball, Fresh Cuttle Fish Ball, Fresh Canton Dace Fish Ball, Fresh Pork BallFresh Prawn Noodle ($14++) - The staff pipped out the paste from a bag, very tenderFresh Dace Fish Noodle ($11++) - The staff pipped out the paste from a bag, very tenderAssorted Vegetable ($6.80++)Bamboo Pith ($20++) - spongy and softAssorted Mushrooms ($8.80++)Deep Fried Fish Skin ($6.80++)Deep Fried Beancurd Skin ($6.80++) - Everyone's favourite item, had it without soaking in the hotpot, so that it would be light and crispy. Else soaked for a few seconds in hotpot which soaked up the soup easily.Chilled Beancurd ($4++) - It was like a more airy and softer version of the dried bean curd, which was able to soak up the soup.Washed down the meal with Cooling Herbal Tea ($12++/jar) and Sweeten Plum ($12++/jar

Had lunch there with friends. The dumplings and most of the dishes were good. Service and be hit and miss which is a shame. The food is better in the other options available at the ION. Overall experience was Ok.

My friends and I had a celebratory dinner in this restaurant tonight. Of the many choices of soup, we selected pork ribs and tomato, both were quite flavorful. Whilst there are a good selection of ingredients, the quality were average. Service was not up to par, especially that this is their higher end brand.
3
In keeping with its location, the restaurant is well appointed and smart. The selection very extensive and the service attentive. However, there are three things that bothered me: 1) the pricing is eye-wateringly high. A dish of premium beef is priced at over $250/kg and even basic cuts like chicken top $100/kg. 2) the ‘home made’ dumplings, wontons and seasfood balls were average neither strong in texture or favour. 3) the custom is not to provide side tables where the food can be heaped. Except for the meats, everything is placed into the pot for you. This spoils the ‘do it yourself’ experience that particularly excites kids

It used to be one of my favorite places for steamboat. But my last visit (18Nov) turned to be awful. I had to admit that we reserved table 18:30-20:00 and one friend was late. But we were asked for at least 4 times with content like: you know you have to finish by 8 right?/ sorry our last order is 7:30 please make your order(while that's not even 7)/ sorry the next batch of guests arrived...It was Friday night we fully understand that we need to be on time and finish the food. But, to be honest, you completely ruined our mood for the dinner. I will be very reluctant if I were to come again in the future. With good food, it's a pity that the service deteriorated over the year

We went to dine at the restaurant last night (15 Nov 2016) and I must say the unpleasant service provided by Ms Wendy ruined our dinner although we like the food there. We made orders pretty quickly as we always patronize the restaurant, however, whenever we spoke to Ms Wendy or answered her questions to if we would like to top up anything, there was no response from her at all. She either walked away without any acknowledgement to our answers or simply just turned away to proceed on. When we asked for bill, she simply just took the credit card and walked away. Another staff attended to us to top up our drinks and we asked her about the imperial treasure club advertisement on the table. That's when we got our service and the staff patiently explained to us about this recently launched membership loyalty program. We told the staff that we would like to apply for the membership and asked if it's possible to stop the bill. Ms Wendy then returned with the credit card and she commented that we did not tell her about our intention in applying the membership. We told her that no one shared about it when we asked for the bill. We are very disappointed with Ms Wendy's service and thus asked her if there is any feedback form. She gave us the Tripadvisor card and told us we can go to the website to give our feedback. When we left, she said thank you to us. We felt that the service was poor and the attitude was bad

It was our first visit and we had a satisfying meal. The soup bases- pork bone and hot Sichuan - were flavourfully packed with goodness. Fresh ingredients and attentive service also contributed to the positive dining experience. Do expect to pay more for the premium quality dinner and reservation is highly recommended!

Came here with a good friend who was a loyal customer. I must say the ingredients were really fresh although it was a bit pricey. But service was really good too so worth paying for the luxury steamboat dinner

We have been here for steamboat many times and it is our favourite steamboat in Singapore. The ingredients are high quality and the service is excellent and attentive. The condiments for making your own dipping sauce mix are also great and include fried garlic which some paves don't offer. The location is great as ion is a modern shopping centre with excellent facilities.

Imperial at Level 4, ION has a strong following and its best to make reservations if you are heading this way. Besides cubicles, they also have private dining rooms for larger groups. Upon arrival, the hostess will suggest soups, and you can pick from an array off fresh meats, seafood, vegetables and noodles. The clear soup are great and the sauces delightful. Food is filling and suggestion would be to order and top up gradually

Had a business steamboat lunch at Imperial Treasures (@ Somerset, which has closed) and have been itching to go again.Finally snagged a reservation for lunch (full for dinner).Firstly, love the elegant ambience and the lovely booth seats allowing great privacy and wonderful view.Secondly, the pork bone soup was milky!! Yum!! Then the food came ...crispy yam spring roll, fresh seafood and pork, vegetables and noodles. All are excellent (except for the fish slices. Lovely thick cut but dismayed at the tiny bones and tasteless fresh water fish texture). Service is prompt, helpful, and the array of sauces available (brought to table-side) is a treat. Towards the end, the thick broth and noodles was almost like a custom-made ramen experience .. What a great two-in-one for steamboat and ramen lovers.All in all, we loved it for the quality and this would be my go-to place in future for restaurant style steamboat!
