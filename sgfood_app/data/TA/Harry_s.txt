Went here for a snack today - great choice. Nice relaxed bar - typically Harrys - but not too much noise or music.
Had a few Magners and a large nachos between two. Nice to rest for a while.
Nice little watering stop - recommended!!

We dined early due to jet lag fom international flight.
Disappointed to find the airconditioning did not really power up, which made us eat in a hurry and leave. Would have ordered more and stayed longer if it was reasonably cooler inside the cafe.

Good menu and attentive staff. All meals arrived quickly and met expectations. Drinks were expensive as is normal for Singapore. I would go here again.

Small place in Chjimes with some semi-covered outside seating. Menu had great range of choices around a bar food theme. Food was good and services great

My sis and I went shopping and needed to rest our feet. We found Harry's and had a nice little break with a glass of shiraz. Friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere. Also a reprieve from the afternoon heat.

Poor staff with their rudeness spoils everything. Cheerless and very unfriendly. They make patrons feel like they are doing patrons a favour. I do not recommend coming here. Food is so so and expensive. Not worth the money forked out.

We stopped here for pre drinks good location and nice vibe and music. Beer was good although the server got quite confused with our order of the martini gin. Also we ordered triple sausage to share which was quite disappointing, fatty and not presented very well.

we use to come here all the time for after work drinks and now they have removed the hapoy hour one for one, well it isn't very happy anymore. Portion serving sizes are not standard and on occasions our nachos platter seemed sad and not as awesome as before. if the standards continue to drop, we will not go back

We went here before I looked at the rating on trip advisor's. When I saw it was 2300 and some odd of 7000 restaurants I was very concerned. I even consider changing restaurants.I'm glad I didn't. The food was very good, the views on the water were excellent, and the service was outstanding.This restaurant deserves to be rated higher

Visited this bar with Friends for some catch-up session. Each mocktail drinks costs $8 which is priced reasonably.Ambience at Chijmes outlets is good but it's not cooling enough due to a mix of indoor and outdoor.Staff provides good service and approachable. Previously tried their snacks, it's yummy hence the return but this time to another outlet.Will frequent again for drinks.
