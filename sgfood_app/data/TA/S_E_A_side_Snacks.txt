after a tiring day walking around this beautiful aquarium, it is worth to have a sit down and snack on a few things. Prices obviously are higher than going to the 7 11 nearby

Limited variety and expensive. Should provide an indoor small restaurant instead off letting people eat everywhere on the main aquarium

Decent snacks outlet with nice and friendly staff. Fine for quick bites but may take a while for the order to be executed.

I m not sure is it refer 7-11 store. as quite a number of 7-11 near by. but maybe travel season some stock I wants was not available.

If you buy your ticket with MasterCard, you get a $5 voucher. It's a good enough excuse to buy a snack and chill while wandering. Good food, friendly staff.

SEA Side Snacks by the Aquarium is nice place to pop in for some tasty snacks... A bit slow to deliver but the taste makes up for it...

Situated at the entrance of the S.E.A Aquarium this was a very convenient lunching. Food was lovely, service was good, there is also a bit of a show every so often.

Very goood value for money. You only need to keep snacking on Sentosa as it is so hot. The fish and chips did very well with a drink after we had walked around the air conditioned aquarium and before the heat hit us again. Ice cream good too
