Great food at a great location. Very friendly service as well.
On the very expensive side but quality of food and very generous portions.
5
Expencive but Big portions. Suggest you either share the starter or main course. Only order 1 rice..

Dinner was served 90 mins late. 20% discount on the bill after we complained. Waiters were polite thoug
5
We had booked the restaurant for a party. Food was par excellence and so was the service.
We had a good time.

We were 12 of us there for a dinner on saturday evening.Had always heard a lot about the food here so thought of trying.We were absolutely disappointed with service levels, actually “no service” at all. There was no one available to take order in time, no water was served inspite of repeated reminders. The starters and food too longest time. And to top it all, they person taking orders didnt even know what the menu looked like. She was not even able to read the dishes properly. The waiters were serving drinks without any tray in their hands.Absolutely disappointed with the service. Not worth the money
5
We went for a dinner and the staff was among the friendliest we have ever seen. Very attentive and great service. Food and ambience very nice too. The ambi paneer tikka starter was unique and excellent. The veg biryani was nice too. Great for a nice relaxed meal by the sea
1
Me and my wife went to dine here to celebrate her birthday. We were very upset with the kind of service we received. Staff was not friendly, didn’t look out if people needed anything on their table. Food was below par for the price paid. Overall wouldn’t recommend to anyon

I would say one of the best tasting Indian restaurants around.I ordered a lot of interesting vegetarian food and I wasn't disappointed. Great flavours and nice and fresh.Great setting in a lovely location.Service was polite and attentive and even the final bill wasn't too bad

I went there after reading reviews which were quite good, unfortunately I don't think the reviews portray the correct picture. The positives first: it is in Sentosa cove, so the location and views are great, if you want to go away from the hustle and bustle of the city, this is a great option, the staff is amazing too. However their food is one of the worst authentic Indian food, I have tried in Singapore. We ordered 1) Pan Seared hara kebab- This was very oily and tasteless 2) Mushroom makai Palak (did not have sufficient salt) 3) Maa Ki dal makhan wali (had too much salt). The breads were fine though. The portion is also ok. However considering the price, we expected better food. Moreover the food took ages to arrive. I don't know if it was just our bad day or this is the usual standard, I felt compelled to write this review after having their food
4
I visited the restaurant for my husband's Birthday on a saturday evening. For the happening location and royal ambience, I was surprised to see it was not too crowded, just a perfect few tables occupied. We tried the veg tandoor platter and that was amazing. The main course curry could have been better though. The breads were fresh.However, I give a 4 rating for the service. I just told the waiter 10 mins before finishing our main course that it was my husbands birthday and so to do something special for him if possible. And they made a beautiful dessert plate with 'Happy Birthday' written on it (Added 2 complimentary ras malais on the already ordered special icecream plate too). I liked that they considered doing this at such short notice
5
Great atmosphere and excellent food. Miss going there since I moved away from Singapore. The lamb appetizer is a meal in itself. The broccoli is the best. Should have asked for the recipe since I can't duplicate it and haven't found it anywhere else.
3
Went there with my family last weekend. The food is ok. But the service is poor and the staff looks overworked, exhausted and rushed. Wouldn't go there any time soon!!
5
While on the expensive side, the Indian food is fabulous. Fresh, tasty with attentive service. The couch seats are a nice change, and a fantastic view of the marina and the boats.
5
We had a great night at Earl of Hindh the food was really good and the service outstanding. Well done!!
5
I do business trips to Singapore 3 or 4 times per year. I always come back to Earl of Hindh for fresh Indian food. I've never been disappointed. Always good service, friendly waiters, and good food.
4
Went for lunch with family. Food quality was very good - Menu on a smart device was easy to search and decide. Staff was very attentive. Starters were awesome and the food just right. We went for lunch and the place was not very crowded. Overall a good experience- will be going there again soo
5
Went there for lunch today on Friday with Office colleagues and was pleasantly surprised. It's located at Marina along promenade and has good views of yachts parked there. Food was excellent. We started with Veg platter and Masala Papad, Mango Lassi and some veg soups. Both quality, taste and quantity were good and food was fresh. Main course was their special Rampuri Paratha, chole and Gobhi keema. Star was their dessert, Pan ice cream, very authentic and have rich Flavours of real Banarasi Paan.Service was prompt and warm.A must try restaurant for Indian cuisine
5
Went there to celebrate my wife's birthday & had really good time. - Great staff (The staff is really nice; Lincoln, Vipul, all - kudos!)- Good food with reasonable prices- Very good ambience & music- Nice location, bit far from Vivocity but okay for us (You can reach Quayside isle by taking Bus# 3 from Sentosa Beach station)We will be back soon! Cheer
2
This was my third time at Earl of Hindh and the experience was drastically different. We always go to the place to celebrate family occasions and this time it was for my wife's bday. The starters were excellent as always and we were all set for another excellent experience. That's when things went downhill. We waited for about 30 mins before bringing to the staff's attention that we were still waiting for our main course. They were polite about it and a certain Mr Lincoln assured us that the food was on its way. After 5 reminders the food landed at our table after an hour of finishing our starters. Needless to say we had all lost our appetites and barely had anything.On asking for the Manager, the same Mr. Lincoln turned up and to our feedback said that he was sorry for the delay but everything was done as per procedure and that this is the time it normally takes. We called his bluff about having been there twice before without any such delays with much more occupancy than today and then there wasn't a further viable response. Was really pissed off with the apathy. All in all it was great food as always, but a fine dining place like this was completely let down by its service and the apathy of Mr Lincoln.
5
Went there with 2 friends while staying at the W nearby. The food was very good and the service was brilliant. I wanted something specific not on the menu and the chef came out to talk to us and went out of his way to accommodate. Really friendly service and superb food. Highly recommend
5
I booked a table for dinner for my husbands birthday. The food was excellent and they tailor made a dish to my husbands requirements.
It was a Tuesday so the restaurant wasn't very busy but we had a gorgeous table outside overlooking the quayside.
5
A little pricey but location is excellent, food is good and service is excellent. Very accommodating staff. Would visit again
5
Wow, I was a little optimistic. .but I was blown away. ..awesome food..very tasty..pls try the Briyani. Very nice surrounding. With ambiance lighting..surreal vicinity. ..good very good.. totally pleased. ..oh of course. .the staff..top class....

i was so looking forward to dining at the earl of hindh having heard about it from friends. but i was underwhelmed. we ate outside. when i booked i got the impression that outside was by the water, on a pretty terrace (but this was my imagination and nothing the management said.) but the outside was more like part of a walkway—no fault of the restaurant's again, with cheapie looking fairy lights and a feeling that the tables weren't really meant to be there. yes there were boats moored outside but it was dark and you could hardly see the water. all that would have been fine but really the food was nothing to write home about. the signature lamb chops were good -- tender and well seasoned. the tandoori chicken was just, well tandoori chicken, bordering on dry. we ordered daal and okra both of which were tasty. others in our group had rotis and said they were good. i ordered prawn biryani which was fine but not spectacular. the paan kulfi for dessert was fabulous. i was underwhelmed because the earl of hindh isn't cheap and i expected more, both decor and food wise
4
we requested for Jain food as the waiter was not sure the chef came out and took the order.he recommended many dishes and was offering to make some not on menu.i think its nice to see when they are willing to go out of there way to keep clients happ

My family of two adults and two kids ate here tonight (we were staying near by at the W Hotel). I found the restaurant using the Trip Advisor app. The cooking definitely lived up to the reviews. The minced lamb kebabs we had for starters were well seasoned and its spiciness balanced. It was a generous portion. For mains, we shared Palak Paneer and Butter Chicken, accompanied by garlic naan (average) and the house special paratha (fluffy and crisp). Even though the mains looked small, in the end we ordered extra naan to mop up the yummy gravy. It was more than enough. The Mango Lassi was thick and creamy, just the right touch of sweetness and helped my kids cope with the heat of the spices. We rounded up the meal with Gulab Jamun, deep fried fragrant balls of dough soaked in syrup (divine) and Mango Kulfi (ice cream) which was nutty and interestingly not very sweet, a perfect counterfoil to the warm sweet Gulab Jamun. Ask for a seat on the verandah so you get a lovely view of the marina as you dine. The prices were higher than average but so was the quality of food.

We wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary amidst good Indian food and an equally pleasant ambience. Earl of Hind was indeed a great choice we made, thanks to some good reference we received from our friends.The staff was friendly and made sure we had one of our best times together. They were accommodating and considerate enough to let us have the table we wanted despite the reservation on a different table.Outstanding Kakori kababs, gulab-e-jamun and paan ice cream just made our day !!! Would love to come back soon..
5
We had a pleasurable time at Earl of Hindh. Spectacular views of the Sentosa Cove were just the perfect ambience for the Friday evening date night. It was my husband's birthday and Earl of Hindh food sure made it a wonderful experience. Probably the best Indian food we had in Singapore. The paneer (cottage cheese), the rampuri parathas, the complementary paan icecream (for bday celebrations) were delectable. The presentation was wonderful and we would definitely visit again
5
I visited the Earl of Hind at Sentosa Cove twice during nov & would love to go as often as I can because each visit is an amazing culinary experience. We were there last weekend with a group of 11 friends, who are all connoisseurs of good food. Each one of us enjoyed the exceptional food cooked up by Chef Negi . The Menu was so much appreciated , that when the Chef came out to our table , the whole group spontaneously started clapping for him. Following it with praises for each dish & presentation of the dishes .Without any doubt the whole group voted the food quality & taste to be par excellence.Be it vegetarian or Non vegetarian menu , whether it is a simple samosa, or broccoli, kebab or lamb or any Dish on the list of Menu Chef Negi and his team add a twist to the dish. Yes you may find upteen restaurants around singapore serving the kebabs, meats, nan breads, dal makhani & paneer items ... but the same Dishes at Earl of Hind are a notch higher in quality & taste presentation & ambiance of Sentosa cove.If you want to have a lovely meal - a date, a birthday, an anniversary to celebrate or Christmas with family or friends in a lovely ambiance I would highly recommend the Earl of Hind. The staff at service- Ms Kaye,Mr. Vipul, or Ms Fish were excellent in their service & perfectly complimented the Chef, making the whole dining experience A memorable one
5
I'm never going anywhere else for Indian food in Singapore.We have been to Earl of Hind a couple of times now and can safely say that it is one of the finest Indian restaurants in Singapore. Most recently, we hosted a small lunch party at the restaurant and owner, Mr. Ranjeet, did an excellent job in helping us customise our menu to our liking. The staff were amazing and very accommodative of our party – always making sure that all our guests were taken care of. Chef Negi is extremely skilled and ensures that every dish is a treat for the senses. Our favourites include the plate of starters (the Kakori kebab is heaven), their assortment of naans (the novelty naans with herbs and cheese) and their dessert platter with the paan ice cream. If you are looking for authentic Indian food with a great ambience at a reasonable price, you can’t go wrong with this place
5
Very good location with not so much noise around. Excellent Indian food, no one will miss the true North Indian delicacy at this place.
4
Good food. Good service. Only Indian restaurant in Sentosa - so quite expensive. But a good atmosphere for sure. The chef can make food non spicy for kids - the Paneer Mahani is super. Sometimes seems a bit shortstaffed but the staff tries their best.
5
The variety , the taste , the ingredients used in dishes , the chefs and the staff all matched - all put together its amazing and excellent food with service.
5
Earl Of Hindh definitely has the best Indian food in Singapore. The food has an authentic taste and the atmosphere here is brilliant. I would highly recommend this place if you are Indian and feeling homesick.
5
Perhaps the Best Fine Dining Indian Food Restaurant in Singapore by the side of W Hotel at Santosa Island. Excellent location overlooking the water body. Superb Food, Plush Seating and excellent service as the staff knew exactly how to time serving when they realised that six of us were in a business meeting over dinner. Chef Negi manages to give authentic taste of North Indian and Mughlai food. A must visit for me now each time I will be in Singapore
4
Food and service is great but it is astonishingly eyewateringly expensive. I took my three kids for dinner here. We had two starters between us and three main courses. Apart from two pints of draft lager for me, we only had tap water. No other drinks and no deserts yet it still cost Â£150. Holy Mother of God. That is expensive. Even by Singaporean standards that's expensive and it simply isn't worth it. My advice is to go somewhere else
5
Amazing location at quayside isle, the new hangout for explorers and food lovers. Alfresco option is available. Food portions are large considering breads and starters. Preparation is delicious and presentation is modern. We tried veg pakora, tandoori chicken, kasoori chicken for starters. Kashmiri naan (earl of hindh naan) and cheese kulcha were exceptional. Main courses were equally good. The restaurant provides a cozy luxurious dining experience. Cost-$$
5
I'm not Indian, however more than half the guest last night were!Great menu selection with all the favourites plus a few house specialities. Excellent service and wow food. Wine prices are so very good.I will be going back....well done to the chef and staff

I have been to many indian restaurants here and overseas . I heard a lot about earl of hind and a good friend recommended it highly. It was a family occasion - my Mum's birthday dinner too. The restaurant has al fresco or indoor dining , though the al fresco is under cover too. It has a very stylish royal Indian type decor. The menu is on an iPad and easy to read. Kaye our hostess was most helpful and guided us through the menu. When the food came , we simply wanted to try everything became it was just tasty , succulent and very well good. The lamb rack was one of the best we tasted- juicy, charred a bit , but excellently seasoned.The chicken briyani was fragrant , soft and fluffy with generous portions of tender chicken. The Naans were warm and not chewy nor thick. The earl of hind naan is excellent. The bindhi , daal and brinjal were very complementary dishes - wonderfully prepared and full of flavour. The kids enjoyed the butter chicken - as did myself !We were too full to have dessert but my dear friend arranged for the chef to prepare a special assortment of desserts for my Mum ! We had gulab jamun, rose essence with milk , kulfi - tasting portions but suddenly we had space to savour all within a few minutes, and then wash it down with masala chai ! Service is good and Kaye is excellent , though I would think that for a restaurant with this level of pricing , the overall service must add to the experience . We had excellent treatment because my friend knew the chef and owner and I do hope that other staff attain Kaye's standard. It's not cheap and you would probably spend about S$65-75 per person for dinner. Still an overall wonderful dinner and experience . Definitely worth a second visit and good place for special occasions
5
Went for a birthday celebration booked via an online service. Very warm and inviting staff / showed us a few table alternatives and settled us in.Everything we ordered - soups, drinks, paneer, okra, daal, variety of rotis and dessert were just great. The effort taken in preparing each dish immediately let's you know that you aren't in an ordinary restaurant anymore. Many items were a 'wow'.Ms Kaye - who was waiting our table - needs a shout out and mention for reminding all what good service is - especially in the current times when service standards are south bound. Great with her warmth, friendly recommendations egging you on to order a drink or try a dish and finally the ability to not only understand the menu but also express a view - not the usual "let me check and come back".STRONGLY recommend it.PS - we had mentioned on the reservation that we were coming for a birthday and to our surprise, not only did the chef serve us a lovely lime mouse cake with gulab jamun but also came over to wish us!
4
Quite authentic and enjoyed the food. Especially when you have kids who want "Indian Khana" :)
It's in a nice quiet place and there are great options for other cuisines too!
4
Been here a few times since we live at the cove. The quality of the food i steady and its some of the best Indian food we have had in Singapore. The service is okay, but not the reason to come here.
4
The family visited in May and we found the food authentic. Kids were very happy and relished the food. The roti, naan and side dishes were good
4
I went to this restaurant for dinner on my visit to Sentosa for my anniversary.
Lovely atmosphere, great service, Hats off to Chef - Amazing food authentic Indian.
Must visit place for all
1
Very bad, poor, disorganised service. Will never go again. They need to first have more staff and give them training. Went with family, was hoping for a pleasant evening, instead the appalling service standards made it a nightmare for the entire family.
4
Not your average Indian restaurant. A little hard to find the first time as it's one of only 3 restaurants in the 2nd floor of Quayside Isle next to W hotel. Next to a kindergarten with a fenced play area it's lucky we went at weekend when closed.Rather quiet but obviously good for discerning gourmets ( all other 4 tables were all SE Asian/ indian diners). Tried classics such as butter chicken ( more tomatoey than creamy), fabulous naans, lamb kakori (soft and succulent) and ambi paneer tikka (generous portion of cottage cheese but not so keen on the pickled sauce). Even less so with the complimentary cleansing drink to end, a Barbie pink, pungent rose flavour! And talking of pink, please get rid of the plastic peach blossom flavours on the table. Doesn't do justice to the nice decor ! The iPad menus were also out of place especially as they couldn't be used to take order anyway. Bill for two at lunch $100.
4
The first few visits here we totally over ordered and so found the meal expensive but teh quality was good enough for us to return - we have now worked out how much to order and to listen to teh advice of the staff who are very helpful. This meal was fantastic - perfect amount and for the three of us under $160 SGD which rivals anywhere else we eat. So what else do you need to know - the food quality is excellent the variety of choice and presentation are also excellent. They have not scrimped on the decor or furniture and so the meal is also enjoyed in comfortable and cool (not cold) al fresco environment
1
Took my wife out for lunch on Mother's day, hoping to find good food in a nice setup. The food was terrible!!We ordered a chicken starter which was not marinated at all leaving it bland once you cut in and cooked only from the outside. Chicken main course that we ordered was watery and tasteless.And the highlight of this experience was that no one bothered when this feedback was provided.This after paying a premium on the dishes (130 odd for 2 people).So thanks but no thanks.My 2 cents to the management: Having a royal name does not make a place a fine dining joint. Your service, courtesy, customer satisfaction and good food makes it a place to come back to again and again. But I guess you already knew that
4
I have been to Earl of Hind about 6 times now and the food is always delicious, well prepared and a joy which is why I keep coming back. It is not cheap, but I come back because it is one of the best quality Indian eateries in Singapore
2
We went for dinner with 4 other couples in February . The location is very nice as you can see all the holted yatch standing on the sea. But unfortunately food is very average. We ordered mutton biriyani (which was below average), dal was fine, some paneer dish which was even below average. The appetizers was okay okay rest the main course was not great. Not at all value for money.Won't recommend to anyone
5
One of the best Indian meals we had in Singapore was here. Had dal makahani and kadhai paneer. It tasted better than many of the restaurants in India.
5
Fantastic place for Dinner. Enjoyed the authentic Mughlai taste. Large portions. Be careful while ordering. Excellebt aervice .
5
Without question one of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore. The quality of the ingredients is really excellent and what brings us back so often. Keep it up - the best in Sentosa by a long way.
5
Had Dinner and lunch here with the family. once indoor and the second on the terrace. we enjoyed both meals. we tried a few dishes of curries+bread and rice. the breads were yummy
service was excellent and the atmosphere lovely.
4
We had dinner here recently. The food is absolutely delicious. We eat a lot of Indian food and this really was good. Best breads I have had anywhere. Portions are generous so don't over order even if you are tempted as we were! The chef came for a chat and he was lovely. Restaurant is at beautiful Sentosa Cove. I would give this 5*s except we thought the service was a bit curt and not very helpful even though the restaurant was quiet. I really recommend this restaurant for the outstanding food.
5
I've been to this restaurant 3 times and each time I liked it more than my previous visit. The ambiance is very cool and after your dinner/lunch you can also have a walk around Sentosa cove which is very refreshing. Staff is attentive and courteous, they even gave us pan kulfi complimentary. Food is really good but a bit pricey but please note the quantity they serve is around 1.25 times than the usual serving - in my first visit we couldn't finish our starters and packed the main course which we ate the next whole day :-
4
This Indian restaurant at the quayside in Sentosa has a great setting. Right by the promenade, the location is just stunning!Indian food at restaurants is typically very heavy and sometime oily. But this restaurant scored on all fronts. The food was absolutely like eating at an Indian household: the flavours were just right and so were the spices.The chef is very friendly and welcoming.The only disappointing factor was the service. We were their only customers as we were there for an early lunch, yet the server didn't smile or have anything to recommend .. Luckily o know Indian food well enough to know what to orderBut a must do if you like Indian cuisine!
4
We visit probably every month or sometimes few times a month..one of the best indian food in Singapore. Excellent paneer dishes, good starters..choice of drinks and lovely setting. My non veg and non Indian friends love the place and force me to arrange dinners there..says something for the place
5
We dined here in September with our cousin in Singapore and had one of the best north Indian meals ever. The food is absolutely top class, all the dishes were faultless apart from the chicken tikka masala, which was a little on the sweet and nondescript side.Service was almost perfect
4
Basically we live close to this restaurant, Hence we did a take away, The food was ordered on the phone, And within a few minutes of my reaching the restaurant they brought out the bags of food, All within 15-20mins or ordering the food, Good service, I was planning to order a glass of wine while I was waiting, but I guess it was not to be, The food was hot, and delicious, We ordered the Kakori Kabab --- AMAZING!!We ordered the Chicken Tikka -- they were chunky pieces of chicken, they were clearly looking at customer satisfaction and we were very satisfied The chicken tikka was soft and delicious and large, we ordered two portions thinking it would be like the standard other restaurants you know the tiny pieces of chicken But this was a pleasant and a very welcome surprise, this chicken tikka was large portions, and large pieces, Thank you for this, We ordered the Butter Chicken, oh my god, that was also amazing!!!All in all the food in this restaurant was an amazing experience, and I am so happy we ordered from here, I will surely be going back, Maybe this time we will sit and dine there, The restaurant had a good ambience, with some outdoor balcony seating as well, and they had a lot of waiters and staff running around, I shall try the dining option the next time, You should try this restaurant the next time
4
We tried this place randomly and were pleasantly surprised with the taste of food, I recommend this place for tender cooked, mildly spiced Indian food, must try place.Place is located inside the Sentosa Island close to Yatch parking, place is serene and beautiful but is not accessible through public transportation
5
We had organized our corporate dinner for 30 pax at this restaurant recently. Though the most convenient mode of transport is taxi for dinner outing but everyone loved the location. The food and ambience were great and complemented well with the team's Friday mood. The seating arrangement was done nicely by Ms Aarti with a welcome board sign. Mr Jaswant Negi, executive chef patiently helped us with the menu selection during booking time by explaining the menu item as well as his own recommendations. Really a great place to organize a party away from the city noise
4
Food was decent and service, at least for the food was good. For my colleagues that ordered fruit juices and lassi, they had to wait for a significant length of time.The rotis were one of the best that I had.For me, a very pleasant surprise was to discover that the carry Amrut, the Indian single malt. For those that have not tried this. you got to give it a shot.Will not spoil the surprise by giving more details of it's distinct rich barley oak taste layered with a silky toffee cream finis
5
We went to dinner at this restaurant tonight with some friends and our dog. The setting is lovely on the 2nd Floor overlooking the Sentosa Quay. The staff were very attentive, anticipating our needs and extremely friendly. We were very surprised to see how dog friendly they are (which is not the norm in Singapore restaurants) and immediately brought a bowl of water for the dog. The kebabs were top notch particularly the Kakori kebab. The Lamb Biryani was excellent. Definitely the best we have had in Singapore. The kebab portions are big so remember that when you order.We shall definitely be going back
5
Located on the upper floor at Quayside Isle, Earl of Hindh is a very nice setting for Indian Food on Sentosa. The restaurant opens to the upper story balcony, and there are some nice tables with sofas outside, I would highly recommend the outside tables as both the furniture and the view are much nicer on the outside.The menu is not as long as in some other places, but still plenty long for choice without overwhelming you. The menu on the tablet is something I've seen before in Little India, but in the setting of Quayside, it takes away a little from the experience to see patron's faces lit up from the tablets - a nice paper menu would be much better.The food itself was very good, in particular the butter naan was one of the best I ever had. The kebap was excellent, with a very fine texture and excellent taste. The gravy dishes were aso quite good, in particular, they had a very smooth and buttery texture and the ingredients appeared to be of a higher quality as usual.The service was mixed, sometimes attentive, sometimes not so, this definitely could be improved. Still, this is an excellent place for Indian food, can recommend
4
We visited last weekend for dinner with my daughter. The food is very tasty and more options in starters for vegetarians. I like the shammi ki Gobi its very tasty. The vegetarian Biryani is very tasty. The overall service is good but price wise its expensive compare to other Indian Restaurant. If your planning weekend visit, reserve the table to sit outside
4
Went here with my girl age 11 last week. She does not like too spicy food, so we asked for some dishes not too spicy. Lamb Karma - never goes wrong....very good. Garlic Naan - could been more crispy - but still very good. Rice Subz Biryani vegetables - very good, but too spicy for my girl. Luckily the yogurt dressing was very tasty and helped with reducing some of the hot tasteI also ordered a chicken Murg Makhani, which was good, but agan abit too spicy for my girl. The atmosphere was good. The waiter apologized for being late with the food, however that was not something we had noticed
2
We must mention that we had great expectations about this place.. The location is spectacular! Ambience is very upscale, staff is very courteous.. And then we are handed over IPad minis as menu card! Wow all good so far! After this pretty much everything was a let down!! The iPads were convenient to browse but it was not ebabled to place orders- I mean if you have invested in iPads what remains is just an app! 4 of us- We ordered vegetarian food.. First came tomato soup- an orange colored liquid cream- there was more cream than any tomatoes.. Taste was creamy and sweet hardly any flavor.. Then came hara bhara kabab- it was 1.5 times the size of a normal ones.. Again the taste was creamy/ buttery/paneer'y'. It tasted creamy sweet with hardly any other flavor.. The main course was palak paneer and dum Aloo bharva- both tasted mild and creamy/ buttery. The palak paneer had no taste of palak.. We had more cream in a day than what we would in months.. The taste is extremely rich/ creamy buttery.. So much that u don't get to taste anything else.. Authentic indian food has to be filled with flavours.. This food is very flat
4
Authentic Indian food, not too expensive. Great taste and well rounded menu of options. We've been a couple of times, tried different dishes each time, liked all of them. Ambience is okay with a nice view of sentosa. Staff are efficient, no complaints but could try harder
3
the location is very nice - however, the issue starts from there. the unit number for the restaurant shows first floor but then the actual restaurant and the entrance is from the 2nd. the staff were super nice. that part of this restaurant was really hard to beat. very sincere and very caring service. the restaurant is done up well - both inside and outside. i rather like the outside seating arrangement although the sofas were a tad too low for the tables. the sofas were pretty comfortable though. this place has an amazing single malt collection. it should in fact be something like a whisky bar / lounge. very very good collection.the food though is pretty average. it is set up as a fine dining outlet but the taste of the food is pretty pedestrian. we had kakori kebabs and murgh malai - both good but just a bit short of superlative. the main course dishes were OK - there was chicken, mutton and a dal. the best course was the dal. this was really good. however, if in an indian meal the chicken and mutton are not up to scratch then there is a problem. this is the problem in this place. the lassi is also OK - not great. overall - nice for a single visit - repeat not so sure
4
Great food both for vegetarians and meat eaters, large portions but a little pricey. Very good draught Kingfisher beer. Nice location at the harbour and easy to get a taxi home from the W Hotel reception. We would definitely go back again.
5
One of the best Indian food and a great service! It's rare to see every single service staff smile in a restaurant.
From starters to mains everything was delicious with its unique flavors and taste. We are definitely returning and recommending this place to others!
3
Knowing Singapore has good choice of ethnic food, this is the only place for India food. On the internet I read about kakkori kebob for a $45 is supposed to be the best. But it was average taste. I asked for recommendation for bread, she suggested 'Rumali Roti', turned out it was a frozen tortilla done in microwave. It got cold and hard soon under the electric fan. The nice thing about this restaurant was the setup and balcony seating.
3
The restaurant is located at Quayside Isle among some of the very trendy restaurants overlooking the marina with tonnes of yatches.. So naturally you would expect prices to be high, and service and food to match it. Also, with Indian food, it takes a lot for the food to justify the high prices which has to come with great service. This restaurant delivered on the food quality for sure. Thoroughly enjoyed the food we ordered, though we found the options to be limited for an Indian menu. The service was average considering the restaurant class, and we felt it could have been slightly better. Overall, happy with the visit, but better Indian restaurants out there in Singapore

The food is really good. As a non Indian who loves Indian food I really like this place. The food is full of flavour and the staff are really friendly. The location is a new part of Sentosa and right on the water in front of all the boats with the W Hotel right next door. They have an interesting Whiskey pairing concept but as a non whiskey drinker I can't comment but and Interesting idea all the same

I've been going to the Earl of Hindh fairly frequently with my family. While the overall experience has always been pleasant, the food can be a hit and a miss.First, the location. It is in Sentosa and therefore one needs a plan to go there. This is not a restaurant you happen to drop into. It is on the cove side to the view is very pleasant.The ambience is nice. Be sure not to sit in the extreme right corner as the air conditioning will never get to you.The staff will always ask if you have a reservation. I always do but have never seen the restaurant filled.The food variety is acceptable and while there isn't a massive variety, you will find something to your liking.In general, the kebabs are quite good. The meat used is fresh and appears to be of top quality. Not too overspiced and just well marinated.The gravy dishes can be a bit hit or a miss. We tried the Chicken Tikka Masala one time and we practically wiped the dish clean. However, when we tried it another time, it was actually below average.The naans on the last occasion were completely undercooked.Note though they have a very unusual variety of parathas that have their own flavors but sometimes these don't work as well with the gravy dishes.Desserts are very limited and perhaps one day we may try them.Service however on all occasion has always been great

Food is good, not sure of the pricing(Whether Cheap or expensive), we paid 121 $ for 2 Adults and 2 kids. Point to keep in mind is that it's located in Sentosa Cove, in the vicinity of W hotel so a premium. Anyways the waiter asked us if we had a reservation and guided us to a corner however we insisted on being seated in the main area and he allowed. I hardly saw 4 tables being occupied, who has reserved the rest (Only the waiter would know as between 7.30 P.M to 9.15 P.M , no other patrons turned up). The thing that annoyed me was he failed to give us expected time it takes to cook, we waited good 45-50 minutes before food arrived. My Butter Paneer had exactly 4 pieces/cubes, if they were running out of it , they should inform the guest!. Taste was good, ambience is alright. It's a restaurant I would go once in a blue moon, not the type I may want to frequent

We thought the food was average to decent in taste- it does not however do justice to the price! The only thing that does is the ambience and the seating. We ordered both vegetarian and non vegetarian items. The collection of wines was decent but the menu for desserts and non alcoholic beverages lacked variety. The complimentary pappadams appeared soggy, i.e lacked crispness. We were here twice in the space of three weeks before arriving at this conclusion and might not return. The bill sets you back by 60$ on an average per person if you skip alcoholic beverages and upto 100$ per person if you have a couple of drinks. I would have offered it four stars had it not been the premium they charge

Earl of Hindh offers a good selection of kebabs and the location overlooking the water is quite good. Though it is a bit pricey compared to similar restaurants.

Great food somewhat too expensive but the quality is great, do not forget to eat their dal, location second floor - great Indian style

Every thing about this restaurant "Location, Ambiance, Food , Service, Personal touch by every member of the staff including the owner themselves"..... is AMAZING. If you haven't tried this... you've surely missed something. Btw, Has become my families favorite :)

I had booked with another fine restaurant for my parents 25th Anniversary but since we found this restaurant right outside our hotel, we decided to cancel the former and stick with this! Restaurant was clean and service was efficient. And the view of the bay with yacht parked was scenic as well. Other than that, it was frankly a waste of my money and time. Menu was limited! I cant believe they had no fish or seafood for that matter on their menu. Aparts from their varied starters, we enjoyed nothing else. Food quality of the main course was not of the standards promised by some of the reviews on TripAdvisor! For the amount i ordered and actually enjoyed, the money i paid was extremely heart wrenching! I could have had a better meal cheaper at Jiggs! Overall experience was not what i expected! Good service pales in comparison to poor menu and poor quality and VERY EXPENSIVE food!!!

The only disappointment we had was we found this restaurant the day before we left to go home. We would of been back for sure! The three of us ate lunch on a nice Saturday afternoon on the deck overlooking the water. It was peaceful and delicious. The salmon my sister had was excellent ( I wish I had the recipe.) My Saag Ghost and my brother in law's Vindaloo were great as well. They had Garlic Naan and I chose a different bread with red chiles. I loved it. Would recommend this restaurant in a heartbeat. Great late lunch left so full we never had dinner

I made a visit to this restaurant after hearing that it was new.I have tried Rang Mahal, Jiggs Kalra, Go India,Kinara,Khansama, Shish Mahal, Maharaja,Omar Shariff, haas and the list goes on, I was looking forward to a great dinner here with my family,but then it was disappointing, Its not the restaurant's fault, they are new ,they can improve. Well, decor was ok, big space,good furnitures. We were given I pads,to look through the menu,at that point I just wanted to get up and leave. There isn't much to order !!! the chicken dishes are about 3-4 max. And very expensiveâ€¦. When I went to another Indian restaurant, we were also given the iPad but there was a function where we could "add" the food and see the total, with helpful staff. Here there was no guide, simply menu given in the hand. But of course ,there was a filipina girl who was nice and friendly. The lady owner also did come and chat with us. Other than that there was no other smile. I think its just not worth what we are paying for. Food came fast, and I like the fact that plates are cleared right after the starters. I think the best place to go to is Kinara in holland village, expensive also but awesome food. I don't think I will be coming back to this restaurant, unless they widen their menu compared to other restaurants and also bring up the quality of food

Now thats what I call a good food and dine experience.. I happen to be at the right place at the right time.. one of THE Indian restraunt in singapore.. i along with my family went and had a great time at Earl. Food was just Perfect !!!!.. even it will give run for money to some so called great restraunt in India... service from the owners themselves added value to the overall experience .. must try is their own special Naan and malai chicken kababs along with butter chicken... i will surely be back next year when i visit singapore again and yes still to taste more Amruts!!!.. Thanks aarti.. harsh and yes Ravi !!!

Awesome taste of Butter Naan, I liked almost all the food over there, butter naan was amazing, it was made with so fresh butter, very soft, no words to say. I am in Singapore for the past 10 years and have been to so many restaurants, but never tasted a naan like this. Amazing, the place is so nice calm, peaceful and the service is excellent. From a very busy schedule if u want to take a break u can go here where it is was so peaceful, calm and fantastic food and service

The quality and presentation of food was that of a run of the mill average suburban North Indian restaurant. This would have been fine had the pricing reflected this, but at $300 for 4 people it's definitely not worth it. Spend your money elsewhere like yantra, pind Baluchi or Punjab grill. Highly disappointed

It's been absolute pleasure dinning @ EOH Singapore.Great Single malts collection, delicious bar-be-que specially Lamb chop, chicken Malai, Prawns...Excellent Ambiance, service and hospitality by charming owner couple Ravi and Jigyasa.Would rate as one of the worlds top Indian restaurant.Looking forward to visit again and again..

Best indian food, great service, fantastic ambience and awesome attitude is how i feel about this place.
Each dish we ordered was perfect - tandoori murgh, tandoori brocolli, vindaloo, and much more. Dont forget to order melt in your mouth kakori kabab.

Had Dinner for 2 on Friday night. A bit hesitant at after mixed bag of reviews. But what a pleasant surprise. Top notch food, first class service, nice ambience. One of the best Indian food we have had for a long time. This restaurant just opened 4 months ago we believe and it is worth visiting. If the owner couple are successfulto keep the chef (superb cooking), they keep having a watchful eye over all, able to keep the staff, and moreover keep up the humble hospitality, they have got it made. We will certainly be revisiting

At last Yantra has some serious completion in Singapore. I went to the Earl of Hindh last night for a take away and was greeted by the owner and his charming Wife both lovely people. I instinctively asked for an Indian beer only to be told they only serve Swiss beers which is a nice twist and the beer, a Santis - Draught was excellent. Anyway about the food -It was excellent and I would recommend without hesitation, I ordered the Murg Kakani $34.00 and the Rogan Josh also $34.00 (although Sentosa residents get 15% off). Not cheep so it had to be good and both dishes basally were without fault and right up there with the best Indian meals I have had in London, Switzerland, Hong Kong and Singapore. Well worth the visit to Sentosa - looking out over the harbor with fine Indian cuisine and an ice cold beer - Just perfect. This will not disappoin

We had dinner on the occasion of my hubby's birthday. Great food, wonderful hospitality. Was really touched by the birthday cake they made and the how the entire staff came forward to wish us. Keep it up. We were also given diwali sweets which we could just taste a bit as we were already too full. I was just disappointed for one thing...the complementary papads that you provided were totally soft and were probably roasted long time ago. I hope that you will take care of even these small little things for your customers.Also,please add more choices to your menu

We choose this restaurant by the highest ranking, and we found that it is a fine restaurant but it cannot be the best restaurant in Singapore. The services and food are standard. And may be we order the food not so much, they seem don't want to serve us anymore

I chose Earl of Hindh for a Diwali lunch because it was the highest rated Indian restaurant on tripadvisor. Booked a table for a group of 13 before going there. Boy, what a letdown. When we were ordering appetizers we were told there were NO vegetarian appetizers. Really? In an Indian restaurant? They had apparently run out of paneer. And every other ingredient needed for vegetarian starters. So the vegetarians essentially had to be satisfied with samosa. When I asked why, I got a sob story about there being a flood of guests the previous night who ate up all their supplies. I had to tell them I didn't really care about last night, because I was here now. The service was abysmal. A refill of beer took 25 minutes. After the last appetizer had been eaten, there was a wait of almost half an hour before the main course was served. In the end, half the food was wasted, because I sadly asked for their recommendation on how many portions to order. It was way too much for us, but obviously more revenue for them.The food was good. But for a pricey restaurant (over 50 dollars a head), you expect a bit more than they could deliver

A group of nearly 20 of us had a lovely Diwali feast which was managed perfectly by the restaurant. The service was peerless, the ambience was awesome, and many of the dishes were simply outstanding.I think this place is a gem of a find and I am certain to return in the near future

We checked reviews online which were positive. So we went ahead to try this place on day of Karva Chauth hoping to eat some good Indian khana and we were more than delighted. Not only is the host Ravi very welcoming and the service very good, the food also was best Indian food we've had in Singapore till date. Must have is the Subz Biryani. Absolutely brilliant! great taste and great quality food! What we also loved was the chole which we dint order and was not on menu but was being made for the owner who was very kind to share a portion of it wit us. It was delicious!!!We were even given complimentary Mango Kulfi which was really sweet of him! Wil definitely be visiting again very soo

Like many others I found this restaurant on tripadvisor. I reached sentosa cove, but was lost as the area was totally new to me. Called up the restaurant and the Restaurant partner, Ravi, came all the way to bus station to ensure that I dont lose my way. It was at 10PM ! This is service par excellence !!!When we reached, we were greeted warmly by the restaurant staff, the service was prompt and efficient. The sitting was very comfortable. I trusted Ravi to decide dinner for us, and we were totally zapped by the taste and quality of the food he ordered.The curries were just perfect, not high on spices/oil/salt, roti was cooked to perfection, paneer was the softest ever I have had in Singapore - justed melted in mouth.Overall to sum up the experience, I am going there again and again and again
