Place is nice & modern, music not too blasting loud, so conversation is bearable without having to scream or shout. Ordered the meat platter - Wagu Beef, Lamb, Chicken, Cauliflower, Sausages, Fries, Baby Quids, Cheese Paltter - Awesome food!
5
Loved the small bites that we've ordered! We had the yellowfin tuna tataki, Wagyu Striploin and Chips with trio dip. For drinks, I'm definitely recommending the Queen Of Spade whisky cocktail!
5
Cheese is a must to try. Steak is pretty rare unless further instruction is given before grilling the steak.
4
Love it! Managed to wait till monkey shoulders. Tried the whiskey too. Scallops is highly recommended. Service was great!
5
Awesome place to chill out with friends , look for bartender jing and he will not disappoint you! Will definitely come back again!
3
Good selection of drinks, good value at happy hour. Food is decent but bite portions are big, would not recommend more than 3 dishes for 2 to share.
5
I've eaten here for both dinner and lunch and the food is great. The drinks menu is amazing with excellent cocktails both with our without alcohol.
4
The place is quite cozy and the food was nice, though on the pricey side. Medium plates are good for sharing for 2.
5
Tried the weekly special of Grilled Japanese sea bream (tai) with confit tomatoes, it was excellent. Their new Chef Kenneth is doing a great job. Can't wait to try his new menu in Dec. Did not have any cocktails this time, just a monkey shoulder highball
5
Ok I This is already by numerous return so I am not going to comment on the food and drink . I like the frontline team at the resturant . I think they are probably half my age but they definitely have high EQ for their age . I can feel their determination to make the resturant successful .
5
The cocktails are awesome! They take it seriously how to make it. The foods are also delicious. Worth the price.. No wonder that when we arrived around 5pm, all the tables inside were already fully booked. :)
5
It's a sinful friday night out. Was craving for Tess Bar roast pork. Done in perfect crispness of the skin. Totally sinful but worth the calories!üòÅ Pair with whisky and it'll be my perfect friday night out! üòç
4
Came back here again today for lunch. We were the only people and so the service was good. The 3 course lunch @ $18++ is great value. Salad or soup for starter, main course and dessert or coffee. No complaints.
4
the restaurant created their own cocktails and some are very interesting and fancy. The food is also good and I enjoyed the wagyu cubes.
5
Went there for happy hour. Good food and drinks and service was excellent! Kudos to all the staff and the manager (i think) who kept smiling and being friendly despite busy hours ‚ò∫Ô∏è
5
I reach resturant at 1.35pm and left at about 4.30pm. It was a very relax afternoon spend at the resturant . Waitress was very knowledgable on the cocktails in the menu. I took 4 cocktails and 1 sparkling wine . This explain how much I enjoy and time flies within that 3 hours .
5
The food was amazingly good - have to try the Brown Rice Mushroom Risotto and White Wine Clam! I was really surprised. The waiter recommended according to our taste and reviews on other people. Our beef was slightly overcooked (Medium instead of Medium Rare) and they immediately took it back and gave us another one.
5
Wonderful, cozy bar for pre-dinner drinks with the nicest bar staff. Though only one of us (in a party of 5) made it to Tess on time for the amazing happy hour deal (50% off all drinks from 5-7), the bartender allowed her to pre-order discounted drinks for us in our absentia. When we arrived, our cocktails were ready and waiting and expertly crafted. Fun, original cocktail menu and a knowledgable and friendly staff that to guide you through the ordering process. Though we had other dinner plans, the food enjoyed by the neighboring tables looked and smelled delicious. Will definitely return with an empty belly and a curious thirst. Thanks for an amazing pre-game, Tess
5
We came here about a year ago and wanted to come back.We were delighted once again with the friendly service, relaxed funky vibe and good food. The Sliders were still tasty. I love the art on the walls too. Definitely a great place to meet friends or for a bite and a drink at happy hour after a days shopping. We will be back again.
5
Two of us went on a Thursday evening and we happened to get there 10min before 7pm and in time for Happy Hour with 30% off drinks. Food was great with sizeable portions - had 4 tapas of camembert cheese, sambal baby octopus, triple-cooked pork belly, sausages and 1 main of prawn linguini. Everything was delicious! Such a good meal. We'll be back for sure
3
I was amazed since greeting from staff, there were nice and cheerful upon arrival. Food was great and fresh!
5
Just round the corner from Raffles this place Tess Bar has an excellent ambience, great food, friendly service and good music playing in background, we went one evening and then back again with friends as we enjoyed it so much.
4
Waiters were attentive and the ambience was great. Food was served promptly though a bit dry. Had the pork belly. It was ok
4
Had a nice dinner with friends on a Tuesday evening Friend's drink was replaced with a stronger one when she mentioned that it tasted weak. Good service! I enjoyed the wagyu cubes on bone marrow. Would recommend making reservations especially on weekends as the place does not have many tables. Entree portions may be a bit small for guys
5
This place is right next door to the Naumi Hotel where we were staying. It has a great atmosphere and friendly staff. My wife and I tried several different cocktails and they were all excellent. The food here is very good and one can order small, medium and large plates. We chose small plates so we could try different dishes. A great night out on a rainy Singapore evening. Luckily we didn't have too far to walk after all the cocktails
4
We had lunch here and surprisingly very good. The price also quite good. We ordered a steak and a risotto, both were good. Before that, the salad and soup also amazing . For dessert we had a tiramisu cake and a cup of coffee. All very good
3
First time @ Tess over the weekend - Our reservation was for 2130 but despite being a bit later in the evening the place was still buzzing and crammed. We asked seats @ the bar to give us a better view of the action. Staff were friendly enough but service for drinks and food bit slow - The place was busy though. We did however find ourselves waiting for a least an hour for our meals to arrive - On enquiry they were not ordered so we needed to re-order. Food - I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t say anything spectacular. It was OK although we did find some items a bit too salty for our taste.For the price and the reputation I was expecting a place that was bit more polished
3
The food sounds much better on paper with its fusion elements than it turns out to be on the plate. The chicken thigh was a sort of limp piece of fried chicken and some limp zucchini jullienne for $16. The beef bourgogne sounded interesting with its wolf berries and Chinese sausage but tasted like, well, beef bourgogne. The prawn pasta featured rubbery frozen prawns in a too sweet, apricot cream sauce.Nothing was awful, but nothing was particularly special.I get that it's trying to be a hipster bar as well as a dining option, but the music was too loud and a bit too thumpy for restaurant hours.
4
The servers were all very friendly and welcoming. My boyfriend and I ordered the steak, king prawn pasta and tiramisu for dessert. The steak and king prawn pasta was great however the portion for the pasta was slightly small and not filling. The tiramisu on the other hand was a disappointment. I was hoping for something that has more coffee taste but ended up with something thats slightly too sweet. Overall it was a great experience
4
Have been visiting Tess bar for several time. I seldom take alcohol but my friends do, so tess bar is always our choice for good food and good cocktails. Love their mushroom risotto. would love their quantity to be bigger for their small plates, abit too little to share for 4pax, or perhaps different pricing options for slightly more pieces. Cocktails are fantastic.Service is good, but seems to have a change of servers compared to the past, perhaps they are new, slightly less attentive and lack of knowledge, but will run to check with the main server and come back to us which is commendable.
4
Had just been to Raffles & found this restaurant very close by.
Quiet dimmed atmosphere.
Service was extremely efficient bringing us drinks while we looked over the menu.
3 of us went for the ribeye steak & it was excellent.
Can recommend.
5
Food was excellent. Staffs were really friendly... small quaint little place that feels exactly like home..
5
Great bespoke cocktails by mixologist Zack. Gin based, refreshing and not too strong. Also ordered the popular bone marrow with wagyu beef cubes ... sinful but excellent. My friends enjoyed the brown rice risotto.
4
Wide selection of food. Nice food and great ambience.
Staff are attentive. Highly recommend their cocktails
4
This is 3rd times I visited Tess bar and it's still did not disappointed me.
We are enjoying the happy hours wine and those food sharing dishes.
5
We went there with my partner for a late snack and the experience was flawless. Excellent service from all the waitresses. We ordered three seafood dishes (clams, squids and mackerell) and they were all not only fresh but came great seasoning. Plus they all arrived at the same time. Wine by the glass was pleasant and the overall price very acceptable. Music is not too loud neither is the AC. Great wine and tapas place! I will probably return to try their lunch.
5
If you want somewhere with good food, atmosphere and with nice music but not so loud you can't hear your partner speak...and..for Singapore...reasonable-ish prices...then visit Tess Bar & Kitchen. Admittedly we arrived fairly early evening so less populated, but I am sure this would be different later, or on a Friday/Sat night. Our starters were quite nice - Squid and Jamon Iberico - which is the real deal....sitting on the bar surface! But the outstanding part were the main courses! My pork chops were exquisitely tender and tasty and my partner's chicken equally so. We were really well looked after and enjoyed the bottle of Prosecco...which at Happy Hour was pretty reasonable at $6
5
it was a high school reunion with tons of yummy food and drinks. We were pampered by the bar-tending team manned by Zack since Steve is on holidays. Glad to see Jingheng helping out to prep the stuff before the crowd rolls in on a friday night. Martin is very nice to walk around to catch up with friends and make us feel so comfy but offering us some salami. Food at Tess is fantastic.We also met some fabulous and talented artists who have their works exhibited at the Singapore contemporary.Great job by the tess team
5
Love the food at Tess, great value for money - especially the lunch set at $18 - very centrally located next door to Raffles in an old shophouse, it has a relaxed atmosphere at lunchtime and is buzzing in the evening with a mixture of young and arty and corporate crowds
5
Had lunch with some colleagues at Tess on Friday, the $18 3 course lunch was great value. We had the lamb shank and miso salmon, both were excellent. Dessert was good but the soup was average. Overall all is good and will be back again soon for lunch
5
This bar serves the best cocktails in singapore. Better than many other places including employees only.
Solid service
4
The Truffle Mushroom Risotto and Bone Marrow was absolutely delicious. The entree Pork Belly and Salsa Corn Chips was not great and not worth the money.
4
Food quality pretty good. Great services too. Great place to chill out. Wine list should further improve too as selection too limited.
5
Recommended. Cool, low key vibe with a great menu to match their amazing cocktails. Try their version of the Singapore Sling -- so much better than the original. Wagyu beef and truffle fries? What more could do you want?
5
Love their grilled octopus, clams, bone marrow with Wagyu cubes, and baked Camembert! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Will be back to get me some more! üòã

Friendly and attentive service staff, good food and great place to chill out with friends.. will definitely be back again.
5
My wife and I had our post-wedding after party at this lovely bar last weekend. Prior to the after party, we had visited Tess Bar a few times for drinks and fell in love with the vibes of the place as well as the service. We decided to booked the entire bar for our post-wedding after party. Fast forward to our wedding day, 120 of my guests descended to Tess Bar and had a ball of a time. Reminded me of those great nights at Lan Kwai Foong. Not only did the guests were treated to the specially prepared cocktails and punch bowls by Steve (the head bartender/owner), they were met with great service from the service staff (bearing in mind that there was more than a 100 people at the venue). Everyone had a great time and we will definitely be back
5
The food was excellent, service staff were polite and attentive. The ambience was perfect, a good place to bring your friends/family. Do try the risotto here, it is absolutely delicious. I would also like to commend Pei Rong for making us feel welcome even though it was our first time at the bar
5
If you want a place to chill with excellent ambience and service, this is the place!With the super friendly staff and delicious food, you won't want to leave this place. Order plenty of small plates to share and the steak is to die for. Bespoke cocktails will not disappoint and they have a wide selection of liquor. This place is very convenient for public transportation as it is near City Hall and Bugis MRT. Kudos to Pei Rong and Martin!This is THE place to go for.

Just had dinner at Tess Bar and Kitchen after a drink in the Long Bar at Raffles (highly recommended). We were initially seated at the bar but swiftly moved to a table when one came available. After ordering food and drinks, the drinks came swiftly however there was a considerable wait on the food. When it arrived, unfortunately there was a mix up in the kitchen where only one portion had been put through (my wife and I had both ordered the ribs) which, after we queried where the second meal was resulted in another lengthy wait meaning we had to share both meals or eat separately. The staff were apologetic but no discount or anything was offered to make up for it. When we had food it was ok but nothing to write home about. Also given it's Christmas there were a few large groups who were VERY loud. I'm all for people having fun but when you have to almost shout at each other to be heard its taking things a bit too far. Also when you get a random guy approaching your wife as a forfeit to buy her a drink it's a little much. Maybe I'd let this slide in a bar but not a restaurant which Tess bills itself as. Not the staffs fault but something to bear in mind around December. Overall not a great meal and we couldn't wait to leave.
4
Held a corporate dinner at Tess. Everyone had favorable feedback. The food was great and the service was excellent although we waited for one of our main course which was delayed for a while.
4
Trendy place close to Raffles block. Good food, nice portions, trendy & modern decoration & atmosphere. A cocktail bar with good bar food list, everything can be shared.
4
good food, lotsa wonderful drinks and cocktails, good service!
will be back again!
Great chill out place!
3
Bread was as hard as a brick and tasted a little stale. ribs were rather tasteless although soft. Tiramisu was pleasantly nice.
5
Definitely a great place for after drinks and hanging out with your friends.
We love the music and chill out ambience
5
Casual atmosphere, delicious sharing-style pub food with a twist (the baked camembert and the wagyu beef!!!) excellent skilled bartenders who can surprise you with a unique cocktail or introduce you to a different brand of your favorite drink. Great place for a catch-up with friends, try it!
2
Dishes came out one by one so the family ate at different times, pasta with prawns was tasteless, grilled octopus was chewy.
5
Tess has the most pleasant people, food and drinks in town. The team is always trying their best to provide the best possible dining and bar experience to their guests.Most importantly, Tess always aims to become better and this aspect does not take a genius to notice. Keep it up, the Tess Team! =
5
visited tess bar again with my regular group of Ironman friends. Really like the food there, especially the iberico ham and the cheese platter. we ordered a great variety of small bites and all end up very tasty. Love the embience and service of Pei Rong, the manager of the bar. She makes sure that our table is well taken care of and attentive to our needs too
5
The meal is always nicely done by the chefs and served by the Tess's pretty staffs.if you are beef lover, remember to order to bone marrow rangers valley with wagyu beef cubes. this is a must try dish !Atmosphere and the music is always nice, I always able to relax and chillin at tess.One of the recommended thing to do: look for the bartender and ask for the customise cocktail based on your request ! Cheers 
5
Good place to chill with great food and great drinks! Lovely staff handled requests well. Would come back again.
4
May suggest to increase the finger foods. May suggest to have the picture of the foods stated inside the menu that easy for the consumers to see
4
Was there to celebrate my husband's birthday and although it was a Sat night, the place was not too crowded or noisy. Dishes were served relatively fast as well! We ordered the triple truffle frites, crispy pork belly, baby octopus and calms in wine for sharing. The dishes were all great tasting and were just nice for two. We did not order dessert as we were too full. And to our surprise, they sent us a rum and raisin tiramisu for my husband's birthday! The staff were really kind and thoughtful and we are definitely coming back again:
5
Went here recently as a group of 3 couples. All the cocktails we had were really tasty and the happy hour discount meant they were well priced for SGP. Had some great starters, a tasty t-bone to share and then deserts. All of which were great. Altho I'd suggest trying some of the solo mains, unless u all fancy sharing a 1.2kg hunk of beef :) They also had a couple of tasty mocktails for my pregnant wife, and were happy to cook her meat again until well done.We'll defo be going back
5
I went to this bar to drink alone. It had a very nice ambiance. The bar was filled with different kinds of liquor and it looked nice. The bartenders were very accommodating and friendly. I ended up having a few drinks with them and even met some of the other guests. Will definitely come back
4
Came here for lunch today and was quite impressed with the quality of the food. I had the French Onion soup for starter, the back ribs for main and the tiramisu for dessert. All were very tasty but the back ribs were especially noteworthy. I'll be tempted to return
3
Good place for drinks and bar snacks but not for an evening meal with conversation.Portions a little small.Cocktails and drinks good.Good service.Would go back for drinks before heading to a club but not for an evening meal
5
This was my 2nd time to the place and it has not disappointed me. I was blown away by the food and drinks during my first visit. I loved the interior as well and just knew that I will be paying another visit soon. So this time around I brought another friend and tried different things on the menu. Food standards were still excellent and service was as efficient as before. Really awesome place if you want good food and a place to chill. I like it that they dim the lights after a certain timing - really sets the mood :
3
I wanted to check out the local eatery scene, but I found the waiters and bar keeps to be so focused on their own hair and cell phones that the expense for me, as a single traveler, was bland and mediocre. I ate at the bar, and had to ask 3 times for salt.
5
A short walk from Raffles, this bar is great for tapas style food and a great choice of drinks; including cocktails. Friendly, lively, and with a good sound system, but without being overpowering; easy to chat - and that's what this sociable place is all about. Busy with locals and tourists alike.The staff and manager were really helpful, as we wandered in on our first night in Singapore. They spent loads of time with us despite being busy.Happy hours etc at certain times. Outside these, prices average for Singapore. Very highly recommended
5
Good place with really creative and tasty cocktails crafted by the talented bartenders. Definitely worth a revisit, although best to get seats inside with the crazy humidity.
5
Although quite fully booked, the staff at Tess were very friendly and were always willing to serve us for our every need. Make a reservation before going!
5
This is my 4th time here and still loving the food.. Tried a cocktail "moshi Moshi" and it's really nice. Nice, friendly staff
5
The food here is very good, especially the oyster, big and juicy. The wagyu beef was very tasty too. Girl friend ordered the gin tonic and it's really the best gin tonic in singapore.
4
The Tess Sling is better than the Raffles Singapore Sling. The small plates shared with a group are a social way to eat and tasty. The stuffed chicken wings, belly pork and salmon were all excellent. Staff v pleasant and efficient. reasonable prices too.
5
Amazing Salmon and Clams, overall great food. Service could be a little faster but the atmosphere is busy and fun.
5
Loved this place from the minute we walked in.Great relaxed but stylish vibe.The concept of supporting young local chefs to explore their talent under an experienced eye means the food has an element of exploration and finesse that all blends magnificently.The beef burger in Duo of Sliders was one of the best we've ever tasted.The side of sweet potato was also faultless. The service was perfect for the environment and style of restaurant and the flexibility with regard to Happy Hour was an unexpected benefit.If we find ourselves back in Singapore we will absolutely be back.
5
We went to the famous must-have Singapore Sling at the Long Bar of Raffles Hotel. I had to search where we could go after and found reviews to this place with an unassuming name of Tess Bar and Kitchen. It was quite near Raffles Hotel, Seah Street just to the left of Raffles Hotel. It had the modern industrial chic mixed with pop art that were rather cheeky lewd. The volume and selection of electronic music was just right - you can hear each other well and the musoc was enjoyable eveb at our age (50++ yo). It has tables outside, which groups can occupy. At the center was a bar with a mixologist - they say the guy can mix for you what you want. They had the Tess Sling -which we compared to the Singapore Sling. I liked the Raffles' version more, but a second Sling in one night, even if it tasted more like a Mojito, is never bad. My husband had the Sloe Gin cocktail and that was really good. Their beers are cold and comes in lager and blond. The service was fast and attentive, the food was very good with a young chef at the helm of this restaurant. Appetizers like the triple frites and the pork belly was well-priced and enjoyable. The sea bream with seafood wrapped in paper was very good. The risotto with mushroom- i will definitely order again. With three appetizers shared among six people and a main each, we were quite full- we did not need dessert.Paying approximately S$35.00 per person, including for the cocktails and drinks, this is very good value.Highly recommended for a good night
5
Everything that we tried was fantastic . We had a few drinks and some finger food but every dish on the menu was creative delicious and well presented. The stuffed chicken wings were out of the world and so were the truffle flavored chips. The baked cheese however was the best with the truffle oil . Innovative cocktails and surprisingly attentive and friendly service ! The tintin posters( with a difference )are to etch out for. On a lighter note for a very strange reason the chicken wings are priced at 13.80 not 13 not 14 not even 13 and a half wonder wh
5
Even though it was just a short 45 minutes of catching up with my mates, it was such a surprise to me that such a lovely Bar & Kitchen is located at the corner of the quiet Seah Street!First impressions are all positive with the design of the place being very modern-ly cosy & the crowd was just right.Food I must say is down right impressive & the presentation of the drinks are no where on the losing end at all!Prices are worth the quality and taste as well & I couldn't even complaint.Service was excellent as my table shamelessly asked for assistance several times but every single one of the staff put on a genuine smile whenever they are alerted. It's very nice tho.I would return again soon
5
Love the friendly staff and service. Tess Bar is a great place to catch up with friends or hang out after work!
4
Great place, great fold and great cocktails. Awesome place to catch up with Aussie friends who i havent seen for 5 years! Definitely reccomend coming back here again.
PS: been here 6 times already and still loving it every time.
5
I love how Steve serves our drinks! It's fabulous and the atmosphere of the bar is just phenomenal. Definitely must come and must visit this bar!
5
Nice bar..nice decor..best service..uou can ask for the bartender steve to serve and recommend ur drink..
Really recommended..thumps upüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
5
Edwin and his team will not fail to surprise you. We love the coctail serve here, highly recommended place to chill out.
5
I really like the service here, the owner Edwin n his team of lovely crews really take good care of us here. We booked the entire place for a private function. All the guests enjoyed themselves. The buffet dinner provided was very good too, the ingredients are of high quality and the salmon is very juicy n succulent. The location of the bar is so centrally located in singapore n makes travelling, parking very convenient. It's truly a go to place for chill out and private event
5
I have been here both during dinner and lunch, often choosing this place to dine at while catching up with my friends as it is placed in a relatively convenient venue. The lunch menu is the same as, but shorter version of the dinner menu, but the good thing about it is that the main courses come as a set, where you can choose from either a salad or soup of the day and then finish off with coffee or dessert. It's really affordable and kudos to the female staff who has to handle so many customers during the busy hour of lunch (she's always working alone), yet still managing to provide tip-top and friendly service. As for dinner, their menu is extensive, boasting different varieties of french and asian fusion dishes. The menu is divided into small and medium plates and I would recommend getting a few small plates and one or two medium plates to share so that you can enjoy more variety. Their manager, Pei Rong as well as the other female staff provide excellent service and will kindly advise you on what to order as well. The Triple Truffle Frites, Baked Camembert Cheese, Baby Octopus with Mangalica Salami and the Sauteed White Clams are my favourite small plates and I order them each time I'm there (not even getting close to sick of eating the same things yet!). My favourite medium plates are the Wagyu Beef Cubes and Bone Marrow (albeit the cubes are sometimes too much on the fatty side), Braised Lamb Shortribs (P.S. I'm not usually a fan of lamb) as well as the Mushroom Risotto. I like the Paper Wrapped Seabream as well, the broth is perfect and not too fishy. As for the drinks, I usually order bespoken cocktails, carefully constructed with much thought by the bartenders, who are very willing to create something that suits my tastes, making sure to double check on any ingredients I may dislike beforehand. They make really amazing drinks which are both delicious, smooth and VERY PRETTY. They put a lot of effort into decorating the cocktails and since every drink is different every time, it feels like I am opening a present whenever I order a bespoke cocktail. Overall, the food and cocktails are amazing and the service is more than great, the team appears to work very well together and they are always smiling. My friends and I always feel very welcomed over there and I love how they are very attentive to their customers' needs even when it is a busy day or night. The outlet is usually always full even on weekdays for dinner, so I recommend to call in advance to place a reservation or book online through Chope
5
Been to tess bar twice and the food and service has been nothing but amazing! :) Great ambience and excellent food, staffs were really friendly in helping to explain the menu and were really attentive. Would drop by again soon to chill and would definitely recommend this place to all of my friends!
5
Stayed next door to Tess at Naumi during a 3 night passing trip through Singapore and ate and drank at Tess four times. The drinks were great, especially the Negroni√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s, living up to the award-winning reputation. We had tried most of the sharing plates on the menu and loved them all. Service is low-key (seems to be common in Singapore)which we like, and the staff were fast, friendly and knew what they were doing. Would definitely go back during our next trip
4
Reasonable food menu, where most of the items in the menu are done thoughtfully and well-executed. Although some items fall a bit flat on taste/aroma(but normally never both), quality is generally there.The Baked Camembert with mushroom and toast is a must-try(imho), beef cubes and marrow and pork belly are good considerations too. Brussel Sprouts fell flat but has good aromas, and the Triple Truffle Frites has an average whiff but the accompanying dips were delicious.Cocktails are their forte with Steve as the head bartender, most cocktails hit the right notes; fresh, sophisticated and sometimes innovative, mostly avoided the dreaded 'cough syrup' feel, often associated with irresponsible bar-tending.Service was warm mostly, but one or two service staff can be a bit stiff, or perhaps looked to be having a bad day perpetually, both times I was there. But smile and brighten their day, and they should reciprocate.Half the seating is on low-lying sofa, so if you wish to have a normal dining table, do book in advanc
5
One of the fav haunts for me and my friends. We love Steve's bespoke cocktails and we have also tried most items on Chef Martin's new menu, including the festive Pistachio pork roulade with saffron white beans. Am considering to spend my xmas eve here..hee..
5
A great place to hang out with friends. The menu is good and affordable. Staffs were also friendly! Will not hesitate to visit again. Highly recommended!
2
Below average food at high prices with prickly service. No thanks. Highlight was a margarita cocktail not on the drinks list other than that would not visit again.
5
Followed my aunt to a new cocktail bar, it was very interesting. Apparently the head bartender Steve is the Diageo Worldclass SE Asia champion and his cocktails were yummy. The small plate food were wonderful for sharing and very good esp the stuffed chicken wings and grilled miso salmon cubes. Will be back with my friends, the bar boys are friendly and attentive
5
This was my second time to Tess with 2 friends from Vietnam after some shopping at Bugis. I was pleasantly surprised that the kitchen was still open. We ordered a stuffed chicken wings, grilled miso salmon and a duck confit which was not on the menu ... the food was delish and the bespoke cocktails (cant rem the ingredients) we very nice indeed. There was even a beautiful tree to boot ... but the aircon was too cold ... guess was because it was raining outside. Will definitely be back
5
Been coming here since it opened. I've had solo meals here, had big parties, cosy dinners and business drinks. For regulars like myself, its cosy and comforting, with an easy going atmosphere. No pretentious decor here.... just a very practical place to have good fun and great eats. A typical "hangout" evening usually begins with some excellent stalwart menu items I can always count on, like their elegantly simple but always yummy mixed truffle fries, pork belly cubes and great beers on tap to chug. The stuffed chicken wings and cheese platters are worth mention too. Beyond starters, I usually check with the staff if the kitchen's whipped up something new, something that happens often.You know the place is something special when its always buzzing with new faces checking the place out for the first time, as well as long-time regulars. Heck, even the super friendly staff have been with the place forever, which is great cos' they remember you and your preferences. That's always nice and I love the service here.In spite of the familiarity, Tess somehow manages to never get old. They breathe new life into the menu often enough so there's always something temptingly fresh to sample. A constant crusade for your taste buds is enthusiastically pursued and you can expect intriguing daily specials and chef's recommendations. The same goes for the spirits here too since the owner is something of a single malt connoisseur. If you indulge him, he's always delighted to roll out the barrel with you, regaling you with fantastic tipple tips and tales while you put away another gram of his newest whiskey. I'm not a cocktail drinker myself, which is a good thing because the bar is frequently choc-a-bloc with fans of their award winning bartender. I know some of my female buddies absolutely adore his various fruit martini concoctions. And yet some other females just adore the bartender... period. LOL....Me? I'm just happy to sit back at my favorite table sipping suds, relishing this plate of Wagyu bone marrow, and otherwise just enjoying another great evening here at Tess with my friends
5
Here for a couple of drinks to find myself endulged in an ambience that preceeds the usual bar and bistro. The staff are friendly and approachable making the overall experience a more then delightful one.If you are here to enjoy the small bites, you absolutely must try the Tete De Moine. If you are into wine and cheese this is one dish you do not want to miss out!For chill drinks and catch up session this is one place you don't want to miss

A great hang out with awesome cocktails and food selections! I was particularly impressed with the prompt and attentive service from the staff. My personal favourite for the night are the stuffed chicken wings. The lightly battered crisps on the outside with that outburst of succulent flavors from the stuffed chorizos in it was truly remarkable! Highly recommended and Will go back for more

I brought my business associates and customers from overseas to Tess for happy hour drinks and dinner. They were very impressed with the wide selection of drinks from the bar's award-winning cocktails, the awesome wines and variety of whiskies & brandies. The cosy place and friendly/cheerful staff helped to break the ice with my guests and our serious business conversations soon changed to more personal sharing and jokes. My guests from Thailand and Taiwan were full of praises on the delicious food which was spontaneously recommended by the staff for easy sharing. I will definitely recommend more friends and business associates to this cool place! And to all the great staff at Tess, continue with the Good job!!! I will be back again. :

A fantastic range of drinks, great food and personal attention by the staff make this one of the best places to hang out in the city with friend or colleagues.
The Whisky, Rum and Gin collections on offer deserve special mention.
Cheers

Awesome crew, great cocktail, wonderful food.
Whether it's business networking, couple dates, or friend's get together,
Tess is THE place to go to.

It is a nice place to hang out. The steak is amazing and they serve interesting cocktails! The crowd only start to appear around 11pm.

Amazing food, great drinks, decent prices. Oysters were great at $3 each. Prime rib was lip-smackingly good and the baked camembert was sublime

I find the seats very uncomfortable and I was sliding and could not eat properly. a few ladies complained the seabass was dry and tough though portion is large. Bone Marrow with beef cubes - wagyu beef cubes has a lot of fats and it was not worth paying S$26 as I only ate the marrow since the beef cubes were all fats. The bread was stale. I doubt it was wagyu beef been used. Pasta with prawns taste good but it is still ordinary. Add $3 for a few tiny clams into the pasta dish. I asked for a glass of water 4 times and was not served. We ordered wines and the only good thing was the bar extended Happy Hours for us in a group. I wont return there as the staff were not attentive when I asked for water. Seats hurt our backs

The stuffed chicken wings were the best thing we tried. Set lunch was value for money. Quality of salad was so-so. Main courses were hit and miss... Dessert tiramisu was very nice. With some pluses and minuses, we would rate it at 3.5 stars. Still pretty good value for money though... Will come back to try more..
1
They have only 3 small starters as veteraian food. Nothing else.If you are looking for vegetarian food this is NOT THE PLACE
2
booked a table for dinner to catch up with a friend. can't hardly hold a normal conversation without shouting. the group at the window were drinking and screaming. guess i had different expectations from a restaurant. the food was decent though, but no repeat anymore
5
This is my favourite bar to go to, and it's not just because of the bespoke cocktails that hit the right spots - their food is equally to die for! Personal favourites: the New Zealand Angus Ribeye 150 Days Grain-fed and the Paper Wrapped Baked Seabream Fillet with Clams and Fennel. They are always almost full, so be sure to make a booking on Chope to secure a seat! 
4
pork loin was too dry; everything else was great. all the service crew on duty were well informed and friendly
5
Good for after work happy hours with 30% off draft beer, wine and house pours. We tried several dishes, and have no complaints. Everything was really well prepared and presented. Food was excellent. Will come back again.
5
Easily the best cocktail in Singapore. Don't waste your time doing the hidden bar thing, just go here.
5
This place is really amazing!
Great food (must have the Asian style Tapas!) yumm!
Brilliant staff, friendly, relaxed and spot on!!!
Stylish relaxed decor.
Cant speak highly enough of the place!!!

In Singapore recently for business and had a spare lunch spot so went to Tess Bar and Kitchen because it was across the road from Raffles. Just wanted something casual and this looked good.Tuesday lunch time and I was the second party in the place. In the 90min I was there, no one else came in which was a shame because it's OK.The beer was cold and the lunch special (complimentary starter and dessert) should have had the punters lining up.Although not spectacular, the prawn linguine was good. Deserves better patronage for a decent and honest restaurant
5
Due to changed plans, had to decide last minute where to eat and saw a review about Tess Bar & Kitchen and decided to check it out. Well, the review did not do the Bar justice. Honestly one of the best meals and experiences I've had in Singapore. Designed around Tapas and sharing plates, the bar has a very well thought out menu that is prepared to exceptionally high and creative standards, with fusion courses that really excite you. To compliment your food are well trained mixologists who are accommodating to different tastes and unique cocktails to try. We stayed for most of the night and the staff came to talk to us and truly made us feel welcome. A really enjoyable evening and will definitely visit again the next time I visit Singapore

I love the vibe and quirky folks @ Tess Bar in Seah Street, with its industrial-chic-tasteful- comfortable interior it makes great Insta-worthy moments. lol. Tess Bar offers a cool respite for those seeking a break from the weekly humdrum at work not forgetting the unconventional cocktails that provides a nice and fresh twist to the traditional cocktails. I like my quiet afternoons there especially, when i need to finish some urgent work. Thumbs up Tess Bar, for the free WIFI too! Perhaps you can work out Free flow of coffee for me the next time i'm there! lol #pushingmyluck#tessbar&kitche

Stumbled in late after a flight and what a surprise. Great food, awesome cocktails..the cognac and peanut butter was a favorite......the staff were great and the chef came out to chat and shouted a taste of his pork belly, freakin delicious.....great vibe, worth the visit if you're in town and/or love bar
5
This expensive but well-decored spot is just down from the Raffles Hotel on Seah St., a small lane. Outside tables for puffers, and an inside rustic resraurant and bar. Investors meet here, so my broker brought me here. Good wine and food as the economy sinks
5
Didn't book so nice to be able to sit at the outside table - for those wanting to enjoy a conversation outside is much quieter too. Had scallops, slow braised beef cheeks and roast French chicken, wolf at Seah street cocktail and one of the beers. It was after happy hour so even though paid menu price well worth it. Food was really fresh, well cooked and presented. Do try this if you want to taste non Asian modern Singaporean cuisine
5
This little gem is anything you could ask for, great staff, great food and some of the best cocktails in town!
4
Nice atmosphere for after work drinks. Food is good - particularly like their cheese appetisers (e.g. the camembert)!
5
Visited this little gem after some food in a near by venue. Didn't know what to expect but was thoroughly impressed! The small bar void of any fancy packaging is a rammed to the rafters with those in the know! Mostly local crowd who like good music and more importantly good cocktails! Zack sorted us out with two delicious offerings and watching him make the drinks (wolf of sech street and a mariachi) was entertainment in itself! The place had a good feel to it and apart from the pretty high prices it was a great experience
3
We went for pre dinner drinks and glad they have happy hours till 7pm. The standard drinks are discounted by 30%. They have an interesting menu of cocktails but I didn't try any (10% discount during HH).We did try a few of the appetizers e.g. Baby octopus, fries, and sausages, all are good and very reasonably priced (below S$10). It's rather quiet during happy hours but the shop started to get crowded when we were leaving. Looks like a popular place. Nice place for a drink if you are in the neighbourhood.
5
We popped into Tess at 10.30 one evening on our way back to the lovely Naumi hotel and it was a real delight. Although pricey, the cocktails are delicious and made by a real pro. The staff were so friendly, they even gave us some complientary nibbles so we could try the ham and cheese. Divine. This is a trendy, happening bar, well located and something special in Singapore. Creative, buzzing, cool
2
we were here after reading some of the reviews on tripadvisor. we tried the lamb as recomendar and it was dry. truffle potato had hardly any truffle. we informar the waiter but she said the chef insisted there was truffle oil. two things come to our mind, either you use cheap low quality truffle oil or there is no truffle oil at all. cocktails were decent. ambience didn't feel it was a cocktail bar, more like a sports bar. at least the service was good
5
In a saturated world of bars, Tess definitely stands out for its personal touch. The minimalist-rustic chic ambience sits well with its interesting menu and offering.The highlight however was the personal attention given to us by the charming bartender who patiently coax us through our bespoke drinks. The downside of this however is that you will never be able to get the exact same drink twice! (as experienced)

I spontaneously stepped inside the Tess Bar & Kitchen in Singapore on an early Saturday evening, looking for the right place with ambiance, Kronenberg 1664 Blanc beer on tap, to quench my thirst on a humid and hot day in Singapore.I was surprised to discover a creative cocktail bar with an exceptionally well-informed and engaging bartender, Zack Lee.I began drinking my refreshing Kronenberg 1664 Blanc(the best beer to drink in the Singapore climate) and noticed the unique ingredients and unexceptionably creative presentations Zack was preparing for his clientele. I inquired into the story of the Tess cocktail bar and Zack's familiarity with Pisco Sour, one of the most delicious cocktails of Peru and Chile, and was impressed with his knowledge, hospitality and artistry of cocktails. Most noticeable, was Zack's ability to attach slices, peels and bits of the fresh fruit included in the cocktail ingredient; in particular the passion fruit. I noticed the savory foods being delivered to other guests and reviewed the unique menu which offers a good selection of small and medium-sized dishes to accompany delicious beers, wines and cocktails served. This is the perfect place to bring you special friends, colleagues or special person in your life for an evening of conversation, culinary and cocktail exploration.Be sure to ask for Zack Lee, inform him of your favorite spirit or alcohol, and allow him to surprise you.I am already organizing our next Wednesday Evening Mid-Week Break for my colleagues and friends at Tess Bar & Kitchen.Hope to see you there

Had dinner and drinks at the bar of this place on a Friday evening. The place was crowded and there was a good vibe. Liked the cocktails, had about 4 different ones, expertly recommended by the bartender based on my preferences. The food was also good but not great
5
After wanting a night off from hawkers and dim sum we checked trip advisor for some suggestions... So glad we went with this one! The food is simply amazing. There was not one dish we could fault from the small plates menu. We ended up ordering the scallops, beef cheek, truffle frites, Irish sausage, and that was more than enough! The cocktails were amazing but a little overpriced for the size of them, however the bar tender has won many awards and his creations are a work of art. Only criticism is for a small restaurant it was very noisy but would definitely go again.
4
Nice cozy place. Great Service. Food was done really well and we absolutely enjoyed ourselves. However, the grill pork chop was way too fatty for our likings.
4
Nice atmosphere, not too try hard while still being a fun place to dine in. Menu selections were good but foremost was the service; attentive and far above average. Would recommend for a relaxed business lunch or lunch with friends.
5
One of the nicely decorated bar! Great food awesome drinks! Love their highly personalize be-spoke cocktails!
5
Visited Tess Bar & Kitchen for lunch earlier this week and the lamb rack was excellent! Lunch set with free soup/salad and coffee/dessert is well priced. It is a waste they don't serve cocktails during lunch. Will definitely come back.
5
Lamb Racks done to perfection with roasted skin and juicy middle. Wagyu Beef with bone marrow. Pork chop that is done is a way you will never believe. Oysters are big and juicy. What I strongly believe is that the outlet does not compromise the quality of food the patrons received. Please try it before you say
5
Great staff, the head barguy and the chef tattoo-ed to the max, food is great, try their version of sio bak, drinks are reasonable, they claim to be a cocktail bar.....unfortunately, they kinda underestimated themselves, they are more than that. Friendly and accommodating people all round.Went there once, half starved, kitchen was closing, still had food prepared. They won me over.Oh, ladies, have seen the head barguy and chef circulating around the tables, very engaging, findling out likes and dislikes, really friendly.Best kept secret this part of town

Visited this place numerous times and it never fails to disappoint. During lunch hours, it is not too packed and the quiet environment is suitable to hold business lunches or catching up with a good friend. Set lunches are great and service is top notch.For dinner is where the wow factor comes in. This places whips up amazing food, from starts to main courses. Every dish is full of flavors and you cannot help but know that much effort was made crafting every item on the menu. Food serves here reads quality, heart, dedication and effort. Personal favorites are their steaks and lamb racks.Tess Bar serves a wide variety of drinks and they do carry quality wines and signature cocktails. Tess Bar is a must try for all

Visited Tess Bar finally after 2 failed attempts (during split shift and Sunday) with my other half and his boss who was visiting.We ordered 6 bespoke cocktails. Looks like a very warm and trendy place (trendy being what we usually avoid), with energetic wait staff.We ordered:1) clams 2) triple truffle 3) octopus and chorizo salad4) sea bass main5) mashed parsnips6) baked Camembert Round 2:6) 2*chocolate fondants 7) 1* apple crumbleI'll start w the bad:Wait staff took our orders without writing down; which I initially marveled at as it's rare to have wait staff that can remember multiple orders.True enough, The parsnips never made it to the table; and we forgot about it later on too.The first sea bass served had a crispy skin on the left side, but the right side was raw. We couldn't separate the fish w a knife n fork after bf took the left side out. The staff brought it back to refire but came back with the 2nd attempt:Same thing happened. But this time we just ate the cooked half and left it on the table.The staff at least had the initiative to not charge us for the fish dish.Quite a pity, it could have been a great dish.Wait staff didn't know what a B&B is; and later we were told they didn't have brandy (in a bespoke cocktail bar??)The drinks like most Singaporean establishment looked great, but lacked substance. Could have had alot more substance to them than the look alone. We had 6 drinks in all.The good:The triple truffle frites was yum, and so was the baked Camembert. The octopus dish was small but packed great flavored and looked v appetizingClam dish was the bomb; I'll happily order a mains sized portion for myself next time Wait staff were friendly and helpfulAtmosphere chilled out and welcomingThey had the Botanist! Our favorite gin.Bill for 3 pax : SGD $340Just some small tweaks needed to make this overall good place grea

My family and I visited this joint for a Saturday night dine-out. Tasteful eclectic accents which are not too overwhelming in the dim lighting place the senses at ease and shimmering bottles of cocktail mixers neatly adorn the shelves behind a fully-stocked bar. Excellent bespoke cocktails executed by an evidently experienced team of bartenders and flavoursome dishes from the kitchen crew. Try a bespoke cocktail with advice from the bartender(s) or create/request your own and see what they can churn out for you. Also order their grilled scallops, baby octopus with sundried tomato, wagyu beef cubes served with bone marrow, and mushroom risotto. Earthy and palatable, the dishes are more than an afterthought at this unassuming eatery.
5
Attractive set luncheon and great for a gourmet meal before chilling out for the night.Adhoc Cocktails base on customer's preference. Warm and friendly staff.Food served at premium quality rather than just bad food from the freezer.My favourite bar to Hangout with my close friends

Good d√©cor and nice ambience to chat as music was not too loud. The bar looks interesting and the drinks are quite nice
5
Tess bar never fails to impress with it's every evolving menu and staple favorites like the crispy pork belly and wagyu beef on marrow . Had the Canadian oysters which were the specials . Perfect pairing with Sauvignon blanc! This trendy yet unpretentious restaurant bar is a hidden gem amongst Singapore's many new dining establishments . It is always refreshing to try new places , but most endearing to find one that you can always feel at home and at the same time entertain your friends. The charming service staff at Tess bar keeps the patrons coming back for more ... Special kudos to chef Martin and cocktail maestro Steve ! Also pei Rong who is always sweet and smiling.. Unfazed by the demands of the bustling crowd
5
I was just walking down the street and I heard the cool music they were playing. I walked in and looked at the menu and I sold. This was the first time I tried Tiger Beer. The taste was new and familiar. I must for beer lovers. The food was even better than the beer. It's a cool place to just chill alone or with friends. I would recommend Tess Bar and Kitchen.

Came here for lunch today with a friend and opted for soup of the day as a starter, the lamb chops for the main course, and the creme brulee for dessert. The soup and the lamb chops were great, while the creme brulee wasn't really a traditional type (but then I haven't yet found anywhere in Singapore that does a decent creme brulee). No soup spoons so you have to use a dessert spoon for the soup, but otherwise all quite good. Cost was a touch over $80 for the 2 of us
