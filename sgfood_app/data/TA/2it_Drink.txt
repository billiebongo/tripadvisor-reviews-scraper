Always our favourite place to go to when craving for a pizza or pasta! Service has always been friendly! Do order the bread basket!

I dont know if 20 bucks is the normal price for a pizza in Singapore, but it seems a bit expensive to me. The pizza isn’t incredible, but still good.

Went for dinner in my own. The pizza was good. I ordered the Speciale which was simple pizza with parma ham n rocket salad. There was sufficient parma ham and was of acceptable quality. the Italian beer though expensive was good.

This has been our favorite neighborhood pizza place but recent couple of times we have noticed that they have reduced toppings on pizza. This place is not cheap, please do not compromise on food quality.

Ordered gourmet pizza and garlic pizza. Not disappointed. Wood fire baked. Delicious. Alcohol was reasonably priced. Be warned that a 30% tax on wine makes this beverage expensive.
4
The pizza here is 5 star! In their wood-oven it is completely perfect. The garlic bread is a must if you're visiting. SO tasty. The pastas are delicious and the caprese salads are to die for. Sometimes lacking on the seasoning but salt and pepper is available on request. The staff are super friendly. We love visiting here - it is definitely our go-to restaurant. Try the lasagna and order a pizza whilst you're at it! Yum!*Take-out is available too

Our family ate there late December. Food was excellent plus it was just downstairs from our hotel. I had Scaloppine Con Funghi E Marsala, Master and Miss Tootti had Spagetti Alla Carbonara and Mr Tootti had Stinco Di Agnello Brasato. Everyone loved what they ordered and it was delivered fast. Staff was very pleasant and helpful

Where in doubt, just order pizza.Wood-fired, thin crusted. Size is good for 2 adults to share.The seafood on the Frutti di Mare pizza is .Kids’ menu available dining in.The Tagliatelle with ragu sauce is excellent for its price tag, so are the kid-sized pizzas. None of the chicken nuggets/ frozen meal disguised as kids’ food nonsense.Pro tip: call for advance reservations as the place fills up really quick, especially during peak dining hours

Looking for an authentic Italian diner, this is the place for you.. good and efficient service . The calamari as not oily and the tomato dipping sauce was yum. We also had pizza with mozzarella, spinach n bacon - good crust and flavorful- may be a bit wet with spinach n cheese . Fettuccine marinara was well good n pasta al dente ! All this with 2 glasses n vino n bottle of San Pellegrino - SGD 12

Went to try their home made pasta. Was a little disappointed as the Linguine and Tortelli was thicker than expected. Overall the suaces and truffles fries hit the right note but the Pagaetti Alla Carbonara was kind of curdled. did not taste bad but the texture was very clumpy. The staff tried to explain to us that the cheese was the cause but maybe it was a late Sunday afternoon and the chefs were tired. will give it another shot one fo these days for lunch. Hopefully I get a better prepared mea

Freshly dough, wood fired pizza can hardly go wrong & it holds true here. The pasta & tiramisu were average. So go for the pizza with a glass of wine & maybe a salad.
5
Very good pizza and service. Good draught beer. Nice sitting place both inside and outside, family friendly ambience
4
The Pizzas here are excellent, better than the pastas in my opinion.
Very nice ice cold Italian beer also.
good service and nice atmosphere.
Nothing to complain about!

Starters - Calamari was good; plentiful and tasty. Pizzas were good, but would have been helpful had they been cut up, or we had a proper pizza slicer.
Service not great, nor were they very busy
5
The food is excellent! The atmosphere is that of a modern casual restaurant with the most amazing pizza in Singapore!. Service was friendly and good. It is a great place to celebrate a special occasion or just to come and enjoy a nice family/friends/date dinner. I will come back for sure

It took us a while to get over the terrible name and venture into this space that was previously occupied by a series of other Italian joints. The lure of fresh pasta was eventually too tempting to resist and let's just say we now eat here so often that we're now pals with the staff.The pasta is fantastic, and so is the caesar salad which features bits of anchovies in a diced omelette. The pizza is good too, with a nice chewy crust. Service varies between fantastic and basic depending on who is serving you.Tip: Always ask for the daily pasta specials because they are great

My kids love this place, the Pizza is the closest we have found to authentic Italian pizza and the pasta is handmade on site. We have not had a bad meal yet at 2it&Drink and struggle to tempt my daughter to try other places! They have a good kids menu with colouring and happily encourage the kids to sit at the "pizza bar" and watch the Pizza's being made, and cooked in the wood fired oven. The service can be hit and miss depending on how busy the restaurant is and who is servicing your table, given the Pizza is made from scratch I am always surprised how there is very little flexibility in the menu (i.e. half and half pizza is impossible). The menu is on the upper end for a pizza restaurant, it is a real shame they do not do a happy hour on drinks like many other restaurants in Singapore do

We were staying at Frasers for over a months & hence happened to dine here often. In fact we would sometimes order on phone & pickup thereafter if we could not go down. Restaurant had enough tables inside & outside. Food was yummy. Staff was friendly & the senior person (I think he was the manager/owner) was very helpful.

wait staff were prompt in offering drinks while seating us. the teenager went for the pappardelle with spicy pork sausage while the parents shared a prosciutto pizza. pizza was made in front of diners. both were very good and do not have overpowering taste of red meat for non-read meat eater like myself. ordered a pannacotta and vanilla gelato. the hub was raving over the pannacotta and he's not a dessert person. teenager took the gelato and said it smelled heavenly with waif of perfumy vanilla. will definitely be back for more
5
A really great find for a Friday evening dinner with the kids. Delicious pizzas (the kids' menu pizza is quite filling, BTW) and even better pastas. The daily specials were also a surprise. Service is also quite nice. 2it really has that home-y feeling and warmth, and great for kids (they even have a viewing deck of the chefs making pizzas). Good value for money too
5
This place offers awesome authentic pizza. Wait staff is very pleasant and share with us their special of the day. Good ambiance and great location. Will recommend ...

We ordered calamari, diavola and a linguine pasta. All ready within 20 minutes and delicious quality.
5
Actually the best pizza I've had so far in Singapore. Freshest ingredients, reasonable prices for Singapore and very good service. Well worth a visit.

With Singaporeans being such avid foodies, I'm not sure how such a great restaurant manages to still keep under the foodie radar. I've been here twice and both times, I was bowled over by their pasta, which is made fresh in-house. The pasta dishes are simple and non-fussy, which allows the true star - the pasta - to truly shine. It's a casual, classy restaurant to have those leisurely weekend meals in. Being located in Valley Point (admittedly a little inconvenient for those who do not drive), it's also pretty quiet most of the time as the mall doesn't quite enjoy the crowds that most malls in Singapore do. Something tells me that if 2it&drink had a simpler, more memorable name, it would be far easier for satisfied customers to remember the restaurant and spread the word to others

Usually you speak about Italian food, you'd come to a place where you cannot even pronounce its name, and struggle with the menu when you hit straight at the descriptions, and when it's time to order you'd let the finger do the ordering like the last time you did on the streets of Bangkok.Well, you will have all of the package here, but coupled with a simple, easy to remember cheesy name.The food, just make you willing to go through all those hassle again and again.Each and every strand of spaghetti cooked to perfection, coated in the sauce and cream there should be. No flashy layout on the plate, no enormous portion to make you feel money well spent, everything is - Simple and Satisfying.We went as a group of friends, wait staff relentlessly go through what is good for first timers, what there is on special that day, and the attitude they put forth the suggestions just sounded like suggestions and not hardselling, which takes a lot of effort to perfect. Kudos to them.We had both pastas and veal across the table and there was not a single of us who did not exclaim a sound of joy after the first taste. It's been a long long time we have not been able to taste good Italian dishes without having to pay an arm and leg and yet still feel hungry after dinner.Although we must say the cheese platter portion is a lil too small, but the rest of the good food just simply allowed us to erase that part of the food on the table.Dessert, so so. But to be fair, we only had Tiramisu.Excellence to 2it. Will certainly return for more

With the number of Italian restaurants in Singapore, it's hard to know which to pick. We decided to try this one out as a Facebook posting indicated one of our favourite Italian chefs from Dubai was now a consultant here.Sadly that consultancy is no more though the food we had at lunch on a Saturday was what we thought good old fashioned Italian food should be - fresh ingredients and straight up delivery. What we ate:Green salad - freshly made with good olive oilQuattro stagionnni pizza - good crust; right balance of crispy outside and chewy centreLinguini vongole - deliciously tastyService was prompt and friendly. The restaurant has plenty of natural light, al fresco seating for those inclined and a casual laid back vibe which is great for the weekend. We wish the portions were a little bigger though; especially the pasta. Having said that, we'd rather have a smaller portion of great tasting vongole pasta than a large serving that tastes of nothing (a recent experience at another restaurant in Singapore comes to mind)

Very homely atmosphere with enthusiastic friendly service. Has a good menu and I loved the Peroni beer on tap. Food is consistently of high quality, prices reflect this premium. Has limited seating outside which can serve as a great place to spend an evening with friends, weather permitting

We have just had lunch here. Walking past it appears like an average shopping centre style restaurant . We decided to have a quick lunch and were very surprised. It was Sunday and the place was near full which was a good sign. Service was friendly and efficient . Had an entree of bruschetta and mains of mussels and Linguine Vognole. This was followed by mango sorbet. All were delicious. While not fine dining this is a standard seriously above normal shopping centre eateries . Definitely worth a try

We had a very pleasant evening here ..Pizza Diavola and Margarita is good. The pasta was excellent especially Italian sausage. The carbonara was okay..They also made a special order for us with pesto - Genovese pasta. The desserts were excellent!Wine list has room for improvement!

The pizza and chicken schinzel here are very good. But that's about it. Their pasta are a definite no-no, tried twice and both times undercooked. Their service is leaves very much to be desired. Everyone is always busy and always avoided eye contact as if afraid they have to do something more for you. Even more atrocious is their loyalty card. It is written that a stamp is given on every $50 spend, but when I produced the card with my payment, the waiter claimed that the stamps are only given for spendings on weekdays which is no where written on the card. Then, as if I am dying for their stamps, the waiter says that this time round he will as an exception he will still give me the stamps. They made me feel as if I am begging. I have since already lost the card since I have decided not to visit them anymore. The restaurant just next, Erwin, is the total opposite. Impeccable Service and always attentive in a good way with even better food at similar price

We went a party of 4 plus two babies for a casual dinner. Pizza is handmade and very well cooked. Salads are good as well. Friendly staff. Recommended!
5
We keep going back here. Never had a bad meal and the staff are very friendly. Kids can watch as the Pizza is made and put into the open oven, pasta is all made on prem. We Simply love this place.
5
This was an outstanding restaurant. Excellent food, excellent service, the whole package!! Nothing to complain about at all.

Nice restaurant with good pizza options and Italian cuisine. Open and airy, might be able to bring large groups here. Thoroughly enjoyed the freshly made pizza (you can watch from the counter). There were pasta and other Italian options on the menu as well. Decent eats and not too pricey. Place is ok for bringing small kids and there are high chairs available
5
Excellent food and very good service. We have tried their pizza and crust is excellent. Not so hard not so soft. From Pasta menu, we chose Braised Beef Agnolotti with Mushrooms. It was 5 star. Not a huge portion, it is just enough and delicious...I also have tried the beef from their main menu, it was also another excellent dish. Meat was soft and tender. Overall I am so glad to find this restaurant

2it is the only restaurant I can call home. Perhaps because am there almost everyday for lunch or for company dinners.Chef Giulio is an amazing host. Always ready to recommend you the latest dish or a new one out of the menu ;)He even procured broccoli for me..downside:making exception of one or two waiters the rest of the staff is very negligent.ie. turning off the light while we are still having our lunch (because they need to close at 2pm sharp...as an Italian restaurant I mean seriously?????) ie. taking the wrong order and arguing with guest over it.As a regular I would expect a different treatment.for the rest it is still my favorite casual spot for friends or for a business lunch.to try: parmigiana di Melanzane, pappardelle con salsiccia, spaghetti ragu' bolognese, veal cotoletta alla milanese and profiterrole!!

I like this place I have been twice. For dinner we got a caesar salad it was crispy and did not have to much dressing. The Pasta was cooked perfectly, and the tiramisu is good! We also went for their set lunch special, this is a great value at $17 you get coffee or tea, Pizza or pasta and a sorbet. Zero complaints here

Arrived in Singapore from Sydney late and went straight to the closest restaurant as we were staying in the Fraser suites.Whilst service and food was good it was not worth the money you paid, when you compare with other closer options.Waiter unsold a mozzarella and mushroom dish which as a small starter cost me S$30. Tiger beer was advertised at $11 a bottle (alcohol is expensive in Singapore) but charged out at S$12!Walk down the road 100m and there are plenty of nicer options
4
I'm a regular at this place since it opened.Service is very friendly and attentive; pizze and pasta cooked diligently (ie not overcooked, pizze are not overlaoded with stuff); interesting wine selection at decent prices (for Singapore standards). Kids menu is competitively priced and food is well cooked (ie not the kids spaghetti shlock you get in many restaurants).I would wish they'd change the menu a bit more often or offer a bigger choice of daily specials, otherwise the menu gets a litte boring after a few visits.would I come again: YES

A weekend afternoon spend here is always a nice one.... good prompt service. We ordered Quattro Stagioni, Vegetariana and Lasagna Ortolana.. Food was good in all respects, fresh and tasty as it was meant to be although I expected a little more from Vegetariana and Lasagna. I especially liked the Quattro pizza for its variety of toppings and thin crust and the overall taste. In terms of decor - the restaurant needs to work a little more. The quality of illustrations of nostalgic bikes and typewriters is poor by any standards - clearly visible to be out of perspective and proportions to the naked eye... some work there would help to make the place look better. A nice afternoon spent with friends nevertheless along with good Italian chilled beer
