Really enjoyed the Kurobuta Pork Jowl, which was excellently marbled and melt in the mouth. The KURO Pork Ramen had creamy broth but the noodles were not as bouncy, overall would still go again. Onsen Tamago, not recommended- no flavor!

Will definitely come back, great experience. Ramen are nice. Kushiyaki platter is good. The thirst quencher kirin beer for $5 only.

The waitress know nothing of the food and drinks. There is no manager Nor supervisor available in the store. Food is normal, not worth paying the price.

My friends and I tried the new restaurant in Suntec tower 3. We were attracted by its cozy ambiance and japanese whiskeys at the bar. To our surprise, the nikka barrel bottle was only $99. And it was damn worth the money. Kushi

Went with my friend to try the skewers but was disappointed by the quality. The mentaiko chicken was very dry and the mushrooms weren't as juicy as I had imagined. The garlic fried rice was fragrant but the fried garlic was so tough that it was stuck to my teeth. Will not return again

Just had a lunch there yesterday. The place is very quiet and cozy. Really a good place to have lunch. Addition to the pleasant location, the 2 supervisors mentioned above also provided me with an excellent service and always served me with a smile on their face. I will definitely go back to this restaurant to have a meal again :)
