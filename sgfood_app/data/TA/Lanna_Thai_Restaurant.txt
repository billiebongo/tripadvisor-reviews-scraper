We had dinner in this restaurant. Everything was great, nothing to complain about. Tasted black pepper crab, pekin duck and seafood curry + beverages( my favorite one is Singapore sling). I cannot say that prices are too high, I think they are normal for Singapore.

I was on my own for a late Friday night dinner - actually the last night of the Chinese New Year celebrations. The uninterrupted view over the Boat Quay was lovely, especially with the full moon rising. The elderly Chinese ladies there looked after me quite well - a chilled mug of Tiger beer and a tiny plate of peanuts were soon delivered while I reviewed the menu. I decided to order small portions of the beef salad (really nice and spicy) followed by beef rendang and vegetable fried rice. Actually I found the portions large and I didn't finish the rice. After a second mug of beer I was well satisfied.The bill came as a bit of a shock - well over S$100 which I hadn't really expected. And later, in the middle of the night I awoke with stomach pains and that lovely urge to get to to the bathroom quickly. A result of the meal? I won't say more, but I'm suspicious..

Good location very good food and good service. Nice position on the quay overlooking the water. My only criticism is that portion size is too large and priced accordingly so that for two people if you want variety say 5 dishes you cant eat it all and you pay more but for 4 or 6 it would be very good indeed. The lemon chicken was outstanding service was good. It is well located in Boat Quay which is smaller and seems slightly more upmarket than Clarke Quay

Very friendly and not pushy reception made us choose this riverfront restaurant with the spectacular view. Main courses are not wallet-friendly, but we had a very nice time here sipping beer and enjoying the good, but not great wonton soup and the wonderful view.For the ambience in a spectacular city. One of my personal top 10
5
Food and service truly excellent. Some others reviews here talk about petty charging for towels and peanuts which is true. However this came to a total of S$2.60 for 3 of us, does this really matter in a city when a beer alone can cost you 20 bucks!!!

On the evening of the Singapore National Day, almost all the restaurants were closed. Arriving at Boat Quay we entered randomly at one of these ... average food, nice view of river and marina bay hotel, but exorbitant price ... 2 soups and 1 salad $ 130 singapore
2
The food here was ok but we asked for and what we were charged were two entirely different prices. We were told the crab would be about $80 but when the bill arrived it was $120. The "gentleman " who seated us and took our order said it was because he did not have a smaller crab but did not bother to tell us prior to putting in the order. I would not have paid that much! Same for the lobster. $195!!!!Our dinner at one of the celebrity chefs restaurants the night before was $100 less and included champagne. We were not dealt with honestly and I feel it was a matter of taking advantage of tourists

Yesterday, after the 52 years independence of Singapore celebration, we wanted to eat at Boat Quais, looking for the famous Chili crab, highly recommended by locals... we decided to go to Lanna Thai restaurant. We took the Chili Crab, even if the menu indicated seasonal price...This was excellent... we liked it much. The surprise came with the bill... this was really expensive ...------------Nous avions décidé d'aller diner au Boat Quai, pour manger le fameux chili de crabe, fortement recommandé par les locaux... nous avons choisi le restaurant Lanna Thai. Nous avons donc pris le Chili de crabe, même si le menu indiquait "prix de saison"...C'était excellent... nous avons adoré.La surprise est venue avec l'addition... c'est très cher..

Lanna Thai Restaurant, Boat Quay, SingaporeWe’d been exploring the town on foot since mid-morning starting at Raffles Hotel on Beach Road. After crossing the Padang and taking-in the iconic Merlion statue from the short viewing platform that extends into Marina Bay, we retraced our path back across the Singapore River but this time by the Anderson Bridge and walked on to the lawns shaded by mature trees that separate the Asian Civilizations Museum from the river-side pavement. There, opposite, was Boat Quay with its galaxy of popular restaurants offering dining with views along the river. Dinner beckoned.It was early evening - 18.30 hours and we hustled passed the statue of Stamford Raffles – what a difference he would have found had he landed there today – and re-crossed the river by the Elgin Bridge further upstream (the oldest of the original bridges still in use) and descended the steps to our left, We found ourselves back in tourist-food land – based upon the original ship landing and wharfing structures that once serviced local and regional shipping, and which has now become a sort-of Disneyesque eating strip. The restaurant touts could see us coming.There must be >50 restaurants, bars, pubs and other eating places along Boat Quay; the choice overwhelms. We had in mind eating over-looking the river with the high rise of the CBD along the sky-line reflected in the water. This meant eating at a restaurant that offered quay-side seating. We quite liked the first place we saw – the restaurant next to the Elgin Bridge – but the further we walked, the better the view towards the Anderson Bridge downstream.By the time we’d explored half-dozen menus and listened to the salesmen & women promoting their tables (and offering ‘happy hour’ drinks and/or discount prices) we’d found a place that suited us; from the Lanna Thai you could catch the curve of the river into Marina Bay (and the distinctive Marina Bay Sands building with the ‘boat’ on top). The pleasant woman to whom we spoke had seemed to offer a more ‘sincere’ sales pitch – always subjective, of course - and a 20% discount on menu prices. Seated above the river we were also at a distance from those extensive tanks of fish, lobsters, crayfish, crabs and more swimming in crystal clear bubble-filled water that lined the inner pavement – tempting some and frightening others for the iniquities of making live food choices.We ordered a couple of plates to share – assorted vegetables and mixed fish/rice, with a bottle of Perrier and a Chang beer on tap. A small plate of peanuts and a couple of paper hand towels in foil were placed in front of us. We nibbled the finger food for five minutes before the drinks and food arrived.The vegetables – mushrooms, pea pods, cauliflower, tomatoes & green leaves – were colourful, exquisite, hot and tasty; the fish/rice less so, and more of a disappointment. Appearance was mixed – a heaped amorphous white blob that did not divide easily, and not as hot as we would have liked. The 3-4 large shrimps/prawns were easy to identify in the mix, but the small pieces of fish were difficult to separate visually from the chopped up egg or the clumps of rice. The fish was warm rather than hot, and got colder as we ate. We didn’t finish the dish.We paid S$22 each for the fish/rice and the vegetables, and the drinks cost S$9. There was a 15% local tax on the meal – so we were informed, and we eventually paid S$51 after our original discount (which came to around S$10). The original bill had also included S$2.10 covering the paper towels and the finger food (i.e. S$1.50 & S$0.60, respectively). Sure, irrelevant in the scheme of things, but sneaky. Service at the table had been good.We figured that we’d paid for a seat with a great view, a beer with which to wind down, a plate of vegetables to be appreciated and an opportunity to reflect upon the modern city-state the Stamford Raffles had helped begin 200 years ago.TripAdvisor does not have a ‘Good’ category, and the Lanna Thai does not fulfil a ‘Very good’ label – thus the choice of ‘Average’ (which is unfortunate). Sure, we’d return, but we’d eat differently.Peter Steele25 June 201

As with any of the places on the Boat Quay (or in Singapore) they are not cheap. The same can be said for Lanna Thai BUT the food was good. We had a table on the water's edge and we were able to watch the moon come up over the Marina. We ordered beer and gin and tonics. We had the fish cakes, Tom Yum soup and Thai seafood noodles. All very tasty. And for Singapore within the price range.what I wasn't happy with was the nickel and diming of charging us for the "tidbit" (some nuts) and "towel" (a wet wipe) to clean our hands - no place else charged these separately. And they include a 15% service charge. All without notice to us that they were going to do so
1
Over priced and though tasty I had the dry beef curry which tasty but I was ill that night. My wife had fish which was nice and she was fine.if you go there choose something that is cooked fresh
4
Although it is situated on the boat quai which is pretty much reserved for tourists, the food there is convincingly good.
The outdoor terrasse is nice and the staff is friendly. Prices are on the higher side though...
2
Seafood was fresh but massively overpriced and when someone ordered their dish they were told somewhat abruptly that they should switch to the lobster which just so happened to be one of the more expensive dishes. Not much fun all in all.
4
Staff were really nice and helpful. Weren't push to get us in and we asked lots of questions and they helped us select a mix of local dishes and custom made some fried rice too. Food was really good and setting is beautuful.It is, however, very expensive. Guess you get that in tourist central but make sure you know what you're getting into
3
Nice medium sized restaurant with good western and Thai cuisine.Unfortunately the services was a bit slow and the prices in the higher part of the range for this type of establishment. The portion sized were good sized.We ate at one of the small tables overlooking the river - quite a nice view.I might go again. But it would not be my first choice
2
We wandered along Boat Quay in search of supper after long flight – the choice was bewildering without recommendations – after a circuit we were tempted into this restaurant – ordered 3 appetisers – prawns, fish cakes and chicken in banana leaves – good selection tasty and welcomed - some beers – all for 100 S$ or £50 in my money – I suppose it is all about location – it was a clear night and Singapore sparkled – it was warm compared to home – and it was our first night – what the heck – thank yo
5
We were wandering in search for a place for dinner- strong touting on street front offering 20% discount and a free round of drinks for the 7 of us. Decided to take a gamble. Food was superb, all very happy with our choices (much to our surprise). One of the best meals we have had here. Great setting by the riverfront. With the discount and the drinks, the bill was very reasonable. Highly recommend!

This is a bit of a tourist trap on Boat Quay with great views across to Marina Sands Bay and as such a great location for the night light show.Food is really good we had a dishes of Baby Squid in Chili, Chicken with Cashews and a Fried Rice. Portions are huge and certainly 3 dishes was more than enough for 4.Service a little slow we had to ask a few times for drinks and the final bill.It is expensive for what you get however, reflecting both its location on Boat Quay and the view afforded. We just walked in on te night we ate there, but on subsequent nights when walking past witnessed some fairly strong touting from waiters to eat at the restaurant which may well have put us of if we had experienced it.Worth a visit but be aware of cost
1
We paid $76 for a plate of stir fried veggies, steamed brocolli with seafood, with one coconut! Usually this would cost ~25 maximum! You can't charge 3X because you're next to the river!!Also, they have 2 menus, one doesn't have any price on it, the other one does, TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT. Go anyewhere else for Thai
4
i don't like being hassled by waiters outside restaurants and tend to walk on when they won't leave you alone but on this occasion we were tired and hungry and in need of a rest so we gave in. Looks nothing special but we got a nice table overlooking the water.We ordered lemon chicken and mango roast duck. Both were good but the duck was especially tasty. Prices seemed a little high but they offered us free drinks which made it ok

Good food. Helpful and pleasant service. Well located on Boat Quay, near the bridge. Convenient for many hotels

Totally disgusted by the overpriced dishes here. SGD22 for a stir fry morning glory??!!! How about the SGD84 for the chilli crab which tastes like it was drenched in tomato ketchup. The chef should be ashamed to dished out such dish and this is supposed to be national dish of Singapore??I can't find any single good point except for the company I am with and the view. I will definitely not come back to this restaurant and neither will I recommend to other people. Please stay away from this restaurant

Seated outside, you get a fantastic view across the river to the ACM and the Sands hotel. We had a Thom Kha Gai soup that was fantastic and noodles with seafood that were also very good. Prices were reasonable given the location. I'd definitely go again when in Singapore - just for the view
5
We had dinner here one evening whilst watching all the sights of the river, laser show from marina sands and listening to classic rock music from the bar next door, a really lovely evening.Lots of traditional thai food. We had satay and fish cakes to start then thai curry, beef hotplate which was a lovely mix of tender beef, peppers, mushroom and curry leaves and special fried rice. That was plenty of food for two, we struggled to finish it all and everything had plenty of flavour. One gin and tonic and a jug of tiger beer all came to 170 dollars including taxes
5
This family-run Thai restaurant is at a fun location, and serves excellent Thai food. We order a special northern Thai pork curry in advance (which had been simmering all day for us), but the dishes from the menu are also excellent: crunchy-fresh green papaya salad, sweet and sour fish and great morning glory
3
Restaurant set up very basic without any trimmings or ambience with the terrace bordering the river. Riverside tables are situated such that with more than two persons, only two have direct views of the river. Turning the tables 90 degrees would overcome this. Service was friendly, but not very attentive. Food was nice and the Indonesian sate was excellent. Prices were over the top and drinks were ridiculously overpriced. This may be explained by the location, but not by the competition as the quay side is very crowded with restaurants
4
We stopped here as there were a lot of people eating already which is always a good sign, and it had a lovely view by the river.Service was quick. We ordered Sweet & Sour chicken, Duck curry, 2 x steamed rice and a jug of Tiger beer. The food was full of flavour and fresh ingredients (plenty of peppers, pineapple, etc). The bill inc tax & service was S$84. Not bad at all for Singapore prices considering the inflation for eating on the river

Visiting Singapore after many decades so checking out the sights again. Went down to Boat quay for drinks, dinner and view of River and Marina Bay Sands lasers and lights. Chose Lanna Thai which was the busiest and most authentic looking of the very touristy restaurants here. Great riverside table with excellent views with prompt and friendly service. We stuck to Thai menu items - mixed satay and Thai fishcakes to start were excellent - you could taste the fresh roasted peanuts in the satay sauce and the texture of the fishcakes was truly Thai. For main course we had delicious Butter Grilled Prawns in a Claypot, Thai Green Curry and Boneless Roast Duck. I asked for nam prim (chilli in fish sauce) on the side for extra spice. All the mains were delicious and authentic. We ordered all small serves which was more than enough for 3 of us. With drinks the meal came to Singapore $250 - not cheap but certainly not a tourist rip off. If you are heading to Boat Quay I would recommend
4
An outdoor restaurant by the quay - very pleasant surroundings and good food. The staff were very helpful , service was timely and portions were large. I ordered a medium serve ..... a small one who have been plenty. Don't forget that 17% tax is added to the bill in Singapore
4
A stroll down Boat Quay to select a restaurant is fun - providing you can politely handle all the restaurateurs who try to entice you into their establishment. The choice is mind-boggling, but the prices are not that cheap. We were attracted to Lanna Thai by the offer of "First drink free" and the fact that their menu included the very dish I had been craving. Good choice, the food was terrific, service was first-class, (quick, friendly), price was acceptable (S$70 for 2 of us) and the location, sitting on the edge of the river was beautiful. I would gladly eat here again.

Visited this restaurant last night friendly helpful staff. We had peking duck which was a first for us. Absolutely lovely and they had deboned it for us as well. Maybe a bit pricey but most restaurant's here in singapore are. Loved it though
3
just eaten here - whilst the food was good, it was more expensive than other similar offerings and the service hit and miss. We ordered mixed satay and chicken noodles but were served seafood noodles. Overall, ok but nothing special.
4
Easy going on the Monday evening we went there. Seafood was all freshly cooked and went down well with the local beer, friendly atmosphere all with a smile. We sat looking straight out along the river
3
This is one of the many restaurants along the river close the Clarke Quay. The area is obviously a popular nightspot. It was difficult to choose a restaurant as they all look quite similar. We chose Lanna as it seemed to offer a good selection of local and Thai foods, and the beer was cheaper. We were here before sunset for an early meal and there were very few people around. The result was very quick and efficient service and cheaper prices for beer (The cost of alcohol goes up later in the evening). The food was average but it was nice to be able to eat alongside the river
3
Dropped by for a meal on our last night in Singapore, having been recommended this place prior to leaving, was looking forward. On arrival, there was no atmosphere, and very (very) few patrons. One of our rules of eating, is, eat with the locals. There were none. We moved on and had dinner at The Penny Black which was more than welcoming
4
We had a decent Thai recent at Lanna Thai. Yes, it's a bit annoying that they put nuts and hand wipes on the table and then charge you for them, but otherwise we thought it was good value for money. They had a 'happy hour' offer on when we dined which helped a lot as alcohol can be very expensive in Singapore
5
We chose the restaurant by chance after visiting many scenic points. We just wanted to have our late dinner as soon as possible. The restaurant is located near the street end and a little bit quiet comparing to that in the middle part of the street. Maybe dinner time had passed (near 9 pm). There are seats near the riverside with better view but we chose a quiet corner without cigarette for our kids. It was also okay. We were very surprised that all food we ordered were very delicious. We ordered:Indonesian satay, fish maw crabmeat thick soup, pandan leaf chicken, cereal tiger king prawns, claypot noodles, fresh Thai coconut and fruit juice. The materials of the soup was enough and the taste was excellent. Chicken meat was soft and juicy. Tiger king prawns were fresh and the cereal was crispy and tasteful. Most importantly it's not oily at all , we liked it very much. We don't understand why few people mentioned the restaurant. We have tried many Chinese (Cantonese) and southeast Asia food, we found the food quality of the restaurant is really excellent

The review title says it all.We chose this place at Boat Quay for no particular reason other than location and the fact the Thai menu sounded really nice. They also offered well discounted Thai Chang Beer with meals.This was a late lunch so it was not crowded.I ordered a Sour and Spicy Shrimp salad and a beer. My wide ordered some Thai vegetables in oyster sauce.We enjoyed a leisurely drink watching the river cruise boats (known as bumboats) and water taxis go past. The marina bay sands rose proudly in the background.The food arrived and looked very appealing. It screamed fresh.With my first taste of the Shrimp salad i was hooked. The balance of flavors, the freshness of the herbs, the shrimp were medium sized (Medium king prawns in Australia) and were cooked to perfection. This was heavenly. I dont know how they treated the lemongrass but it was edible and plentiful cut into tiny tasty curls. The hot and sour dressing component was unbelievable. Had some good ones and some unbalanced bad ones in my time this this left the best at the starting grid. It was as perfect as I could imagine. My wife's vegetable dish was exactly as promised - fresh, not overcooked and well balanced. It had a vegetable in it we had not had before but it was delightful. I could eat here anytime, and it will feature on all subsequent trips to Singapore

Nice restaurant located on the waterfront at Boat Quay. Left another restaurant (Forum Seafood, separate review) and decided to try this place out. Service is very nice and friendly, we told them we were kind of in a hurry and they said they could put a rush in for us no problem. We were a group of four and we all ordered different dishes which we were all satisfied with. I had the deep fried prawns which were very good. The atmosphere is calm and relaxed, perfect setting for an evening meal. Lots to choose from on the menu and the prices are all very reasonable. Highly recommended if you are in the area
4
Had a lot of fun at this place. 8 of us cruised up Boat Quay bargaining with the restaurant barkers for the best deal for us. Settled on Lanna Thai they were very friendly joking and having fun, all the guests seemed to be having a good time. Great location along the river, meals were very good about $30 for stir fry and similar less discount and we bargained for a couple of free beers and also discounted drinks. Very good would go back again
