This is a good option for Hawker style food when visiting the GbtB. We dined here before enjoying the Light & Music show surrounding the SuperTrees.

Saw this restaurant in Tripadvisor and decided to try it. We were not disappointed. The food was good and the aircon really welcome. Would recommend it for a quick bite to eat anytime!

A lovely place to spend a lazy morning. Breakfast is delicious and the alfresco tables are next to an open space in the garden where you can keep an eye on children as they play there on bikes or scooters. :)

Went there for dinner on Saturday evening. Ordered one Hawaiian pizza and one Alio Olio seafood pasta. Both were great, seafood was fresh, pizza was delicious. Glad that we choose this restaurant. After dinner, we went out the restaurant and enjoy the Garden Rhapsody show which was just outside the restaurant. Great dinner, great place, thumbs up

If you are visiting the gardens by the bay, then plan your dinner here! Lovely food. I loved the pizza most! What I like about the place is they will try to help you ind what you can eat! And good range of variety to choose from. specially being non-Singaporean if you are looking at something else than sea-food- I would suggest this

Tip: If you are there for lunch (could apply to dinner as well), be prepared to wait. Like the other outlets at Supertree Dining, there is a mismatch between resources and demand. I was there during the Singapore Garden Festival (held once in two years in August) and this may have exacerbated the situation. What impresses me. The lead waiter (could be the manager) was very proactive, such as ensuring that customers are attended to and explanation provided on the estimated wait time, orders are taken, and tables are cleared before the customers are escorted to their table. As such, the place was very orderly despite the poor level of staffing. I ordered a seafood pasta dish and I am very happy with the quality of the prawns, squid, scallop (only one piece) and various shellfish. Unlike some places where for example, the squid can taste rubbery and flat, I can taste the freshness and the sweetness of the seafood that I am eating. This dish may not be the best of its class but I can attest that it is close. If Casa Verde could maintain this quality standard, I will be back. Unfortunately, my companion ordered a fish and chip dish and had the opposite feedback. While she found the fish to be fresh, she disliked the thick batter. And she thought that the oil used was probably quite recycled and caused to be thirsty till long afterwards. Bottomline: Based on one visit, skip the fish and chip and pay a bit more for the seafood pasta (that is if you enjoyed seafood).
