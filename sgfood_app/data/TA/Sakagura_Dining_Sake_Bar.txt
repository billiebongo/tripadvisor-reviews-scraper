Good food, reasonable price. Service is good also. Will return again if craving for Japanese food. No service charges and GST, save a lot.

Situated in Alexandra Central. Their menu has quite a variety of choices. We had 2 chawanmushi, chirashi don, seafood fried rice, garlic ribeye and a bento set. We spent $90 in total. Quality of food is good, fresh and delicious! The space is slightly cramp though. But we didn't mind it that much. Staffs were friendly and service was prompt. We didn't hear about this place before but got to know it through Groupon. A good place to visit for first timers! And to return again! The place is a little small so call to reserve to avoid disappointment!

When we reached, we found this place in the corner and decided to try the dishes after looking at the menu!The sashimi are in good cut and really fresh! The other dishes are great amd we started ordering more!The boss is very friendly and the servers are very prompt! Overall good service and good food! Will definitely be back again

I bought a goupon voucher for $12 with a value of $20. The place is located on level 1 of a new mall next to Ikea. It's relatively quiet. I chose the Shashimi tempura bento at $22 and a hot green tea. The portion was just nice for me. The sashimi was fresh and tasty. Tempura was also very good, crispy and not oily. The meal ended with a jelly dessert. I will definitely return to try other dishes
