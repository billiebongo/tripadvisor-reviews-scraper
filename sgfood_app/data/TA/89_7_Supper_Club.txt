89.7 Supper club is a neat eatery that serves delicious food (Prata, thosai, western, dim sum)
Atmosphere is bright and vibrant and staff are friendly. Pls visit if u r around the Changi area!

Came here since it was close to the hotel we were staying in. The service was fast but not as friendly as other places we have visited. They do not serve beer as it is a Halal place. The selection is huge! Cheap way to fill up

First evening in Singapore I was looking for somewhere to eat close to the hotel.The restaurant is basically an open terrace with a roof over it. Long rows of tables that reminded me of a mess hall. Large choice of dishes and very tasty.Except the coffee afterwards that was a bit too strong even fory taste
3
Went there for lunch & was told prata on the menu not available, only after 5pm. Thought prata was for breakfast or food to be served day & night? Large lunch crowd & waited more than 35minutes for our food. When we asked, was told that kitchen got jammed. After eating, we waited another 25 minutes for our takeaway even though orders for both dine in & takeaway was ordered at the same time. The food was ok but not something that worth the travel or the long wait.

Restaurant has local (Indian, Chinese, Malay) food,western food.I went,as always,during the off peak hours and so had my food served fast and yummy!Although I find the price for this one crab a bit high at $28.00,it was still a good find. The crab roe was simply divine!Other dishes I frequently go for are the Hong Kong noodles (fried,),their big portion of Fish and chips, satay and don't forget to order a cuppa of teh tarik/ginger tea (always ask for less sweetness or sugar! if you don't have sweet tooth or health issues)

Firstly our decision to go and stay in Changi Village instead of sit in the airport for 14 hours was a great one, plenty to do in the area. I read somewhere just to choose the busiest restaurants and you will usually find good food, so on this occasion that’s what we did. We ordered 4 entrée’s and 2 bottles of water. All in all the food was excellent, the fried thai bean curd was delicious and the dumplings were full of flavour. Best of all everything was cooked fresh, and steaming hot when it arrived, not scooped out of a bain marie. All in all this was $14 for the lot – we went back to the room full and ready for a good sleep before our next journey. Highly recommend

89.7 is located on Changi Village Road and is almost opposite the bus terminus.I had the chilli crab and seafood fried rice to eat and a large mango juice to drink as there was no alcohol on sale.The mango juice certainly was large as I was given around a litre of juice with ice. The seafood rice was excellent and could have easily sufficed on its own.The crab was good, although a bit messy to eat, with just tissues provided to keep oneself clean.Overall, it was a pleasant lunch time meal and at SIN$32, the value was decent too

We ate here just prior to leaving for the airport. In pursuit of some western fayre we both opted for the burger and fries. I have to say it was very good; hot with lots of topping. service was swift, the place is full of local people and the area has a genuine buzz to it. The are lots of local dishes on the menu and with hindsight we should really have chosen one of those, but we had had a disappointing lunch and were both very hungry - the meal did not disappoint! All in all, very good value and would recommend.

Visited this place at around 5.40am on a Sunday morning. There's not many customers at this hour and its about the only coffee shop that is opened in the area.We ordered 2 milo and 4 prata kosong for SGD7/-. We waited close to 15 mins for the prata. The fish curry and prata are very nice even though it is not the best in Singapore
5
If you pass by Changi Village, don't forget to eat at 89.7. They have great serving and friendly staff! Try their Singapore Fried bee hon and their sweet and sour dish! Also, don't missed their refreshing home made ice lemon tea to complete your meal!
4
A couple of mins walk from Village Changi hotel. No alcohol served but wide selection on menu and good price and large portions given. It's a side of street cafe with plastic chairs. Will return!
4
Staffs were very approachable and efficient at handling big crowd. We didnt have to wait too long for the food to come. Food quality was good with reasonable prices!
5
If you are planning a gathering with Muslim friends/colleagues, this is definitely a place to consider as they have a wide range of halal cuisine available (Chinese, Western, Indian etc)
4
Its not for date night but turns out a wide range of tasty asian food. Seems popular with kids / families - locals and visitors. Does takeaway.

A lovely outdoor area, with fantastic food at great prices. If you are in Changi village try this food court area.

Haven eaten in many Hawker/Coffee Shops across Singapore I enjoy coming to Supper Club. Serving staff take orders via a PDA and tables are clean and setting is modern compared to other Hawker eateries. The menu is extremely large and ranges from all usual Chinese, Malay, Indian dishes as well as Seafood and Satay and thus something for everyone.We had Black Pepper Crab, Mee Goreng Pattaya, Mutton Murtabak, Satay, Chicken Rice and Man Tau buns and were all great. Prices extremely reasonable too.A great place for a quick bite or late night supper for that local taste fix
1
Had a seafood horfun, porridge and deep fried baby octopus there. Hor fun & porridge was tasteless. The deep fried octopus was soggy. The place is a halad (muslim) certified restaurant and they serve a variety of different culture food but I reckon they are trying too hard or they are just bad
4
What attracted us to this place mainly was the crowd. Locals frequented this place so that's a good sign they serve good, affordable food. True enough. We were a big group but managed to get a reservation and pre-ordered our meals. Everything we ordered was so good! We mainly ordered Chinese but they also served Indian and Malay cuisine
3
Great place if you are hungry at night.Not easy to get parking during weekends .They do take reservations .They served international food from Dim Sum,local ,Chinese,Indian ,Western etc...Used to serve good food but not anymore.Would be fantastic to have set meals for 2,4 pax etc..Their fried rice and some fried noodles were disappointment as all the rice and the noodles tasted the same and too much soya sauce despite different names on the menu. All their fried rice /noodles had seafood in it eventhough stated otherwise ,very strange !Spring chicken was very oily and they should served the fries separately instead of putting the oily chicken on TOP of the fries .Other dishes .....depends on what you order.Staff attitude ,not too bad .Television installed to keep you occupied in case you don't like your companion haha!Lots of the restaurants around even the Hawker Centre across the street

They serve halal food. From malay to indian food. If you have cravings for those late at night, and you happen to be around changi area, deff the go to place.
4
If you are in Changi Village this is worth trying. A wide variety of food styles (Straits/Nonya, Chinese, Malaysian, Indian (vegetarian and non veg). Served quickly and well at fair prices.

Stopped in here late one night had amazing noodles, the food here is always cooked fresh and there is so much choice you can't fail to get something you like
5
Unexpectedly treated to the most delicious butter chicken masala I've ever eaten. At $7 with friendly, easy to understand staff this really was a great way to end our trip.

Inconsistent Food quality and taste. Dont expect to much of service as they dont focus on it.
Ordered on call sambal chicken fried rice with egg but no egg when i opened it and they still charge the full amount with egg inclusions:(

This is just one of the many outdoor hawker type eatery along the street. Large amount of variety, and suits many dietary requirements. The seats are very compact making it hard to move around, however the staff just come to you and take your orders. Overall a great system and a great way to feel more like a local

This was the most crowded eatery in the laid back Changi Village, as the hawker centre was closed for three days for cleaning.It's more like a coffeeshop feel, but with menus and orders taken at your table.There is a huge variety of choices including Indian, Malay, Chinese and Western food, such as dim sum, rojak, prata, chilli crab, fried chicken and satay. As this is a halal rated restaurant, they do not serve pork.We had an oyster omelette - while it did not look authentic, the taste was good enough and the oysters were fresh. We also had the mee goreng, which was lacking in taste and soggy. The sweet and sour chicken could have been crispier but the taste was okay.The drinks were served in impressive large mugs, and service was quick
4
Just up the road from the Changi Village Hotel, this covered outdoor hawker style eatery has a number of different styles of cuisine. All food and drink is fresh and cooked as requested. The speed of the delivery of the orders is brilliant and the waiting staff are fantastic.Only downside is that there is no alcohol served or outside alcohol allowed, a shame as an ice cold beer on a hot and humid night is great

Ate here on our first night in Singapore in Changi village by the coast. As it was a Friday the place was packed with locals and the atmosphere was great. Served our food on plastic plates and our drinks in plastic beakers sitting at long tables.Service was very quick and the food very tasty

Firstly, this isnt a luxury restaurant. It offers a great choice of lots of local cuisines at plastic tables & with fast arrival of the food you order - great if you're hungry. Turn over is high & the food is very fresh. The staff are very friendly if you smile & say hi, & they are often very, very busy. The food is tasty & fresh - the chicken fried rice is fab, the spring rolls are tasty, the iced lemon tea so refreshing, the sweet/sour yummy. The bill is equally yummy - generally around €25 (£12) for 2! We've eaten here several times now & will go back. Don't be afraid to go in - locals don't generally eat in bad restaurants

A great variety of food from chinese, malay, indian etc
We order mee goreng and horfun. Not bad
More like hawker but quite organised as need to order in counter. Seevice also not bad.
4
Variety of food at great prices. Served fast & delicious too. We ate there twice and it was quite crowded but there are staff to help you find the right table for you. So no worries. Parking is a problem as it is always full.
4
A street restaurant with lots of locals eating there. Fast service and very tasty. The Tom yum soup was very spicy and was a huge bowl enough for 2 people.
4
Excellent selection of food from different cultures. The place is always busy so come early to get a seat. The service staff did not hover you, but were always available in moments. It is outdoors and very good.

Bad experience. Ordered medium rare steak and well done came. Requested the female waitress to change but was refused because I have eaten the two carrots. Yup. Cannot change the steak because I have eaten the two carrots side. Ridiculous. Asked her to throw away everything and I paid $13 for two pieces of carrots. Manager whom i spoke to after paying was focused only on telling us how good quality their steak is. I wouldn't know.

I went there for dinner today with husband and we ordered fish head curry and a shawamara (sp?) wrap. The fish head curry came in one size, the $20 size and the server told us : could be for one person, two persons, three. OK. It was really bad. Curry dilute, tofu, brinjal not fresh, fish not fresh. This is after we decided to give the 89.7 a try even though two other establishments on the same street also sell fish head curry (yes, sublimal messaging here). I see an earlier review of 2012 on yelp saying the fish curry is amazing, well the fish head curry is amazingly bad

Found this place on tripadvisor while looking for places to dine at changi village. Place was crowded both during lunch and dinner. Lots of staff around to attend to customer but not everyone are friendly. First time visiting the place and needed time to browse through the menu but staff was just standing and waiting for my order... Felt uneasy and stressful. Tried their signature congee which comes with fish slice and sotong, very tasty and generous portion of ingredients. They even have a variety of dim sum and all sorts of chinese cze char dishes etc. Kids loved the seafood horfun... Lots of option for drinks and desserts too.Open dining so it can get rather hot and stuffy during the day, more cooling in the evening. The eatery is halal certified, thus their food does not contain any pork

Had been wanting to go this place & finally managed to drop by for dinner before heading to work. The menu had a wide variety of food and types of cuisines(Malay, Chinese, Thai, Indian & Western ). Food portions quite generous with reasonable pricing as well. Only accept cash payments.

This restaurant provide good comfort food. There are many items on the menu but after a long day I wanted something that was going to fill me up and put me to sleep. I tried the pineapple fried rice with chicken. Good meal for my wife and I
