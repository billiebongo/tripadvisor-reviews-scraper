We really enjoyed coming here! Really nice place, and food was great too! We‚Äôll visit again!
Plus it‚Äôs really conveniently located! üëç

In short the drink promo is fantasic but the food can do better. the beer battered fish and chips were good but the rest that i had was sub par and not price worthy.
5
value for money. food was great! nice setting with all the superheroes figurines. awesome experience.
4
Food are delicious and the service was good also. Great place for gathering with friends and family. Food portion quite generous.
3
Good theme restaurant, special for kids but foods is so so and also not cheap compare with food quality . Service there is friendly good.
4
Food was not bad. Atmosphere was good. Just that the place is short handed. We waited very long for each simple request.

To whom it may concern I‚Äôve had the worst experience at your outlet at Tessensohn road. I have several complaints. 1. The food was not tasty at all. We ordered the $120 platter and the beef wasn‚Äôt even tasty. 2. When we asked for plates(because we were sharing the platter), they gave us tiny plates to cut the pork ribs etc which is just ridiculous. When we asked for bigger plates, such as the ones they served the fries in, the reply was that they don‚Äôt have bigger plates. Which is completely ridiculous, they jus served us fries in bigger plates. Finally after so much back and forth, they gave us the plates. 3. We ordered mushroom risotto vegetarian. When it came, there was chicken. My Brother in law is vegetarian and he asked for a change and they said there is nothing they can do. Seriously? What kind of customer service is this? Finally after 15 minutes a new one was brought without the chicken. All the while there were 2 ‚Äúfemale Bartenders‚Äù hiding behind the bar and jus instructing the poor sole server what can and cannot be done. They were obviously jus being very mean to her and bullying her. They themselves were doin absolutely nothing. They were acting as if they own the place and as though we were coming for a free meal. To the owner of this place, this is not the first time I have come to this place and experienced such lousy service by the very same people. If you would like ur business to survive and not receive such negative feedback, u shld first look at changing your incredibly lousy service staff. I can‚Äôt even begin to tell you how annoying it was to sit in this restaurant and eat.

The venue was quite obscure, my GPS could not locate it at first. After a few turns, I managed to find the place and parking lots were few. It was almost 7 pm but the place was relatively empty. We ordered Nice to Meat You platter for 2, beer and ginger ale. It would be nice if they have super heroes smoothies to go with my food. The food was surprisingly good and we finished them all! As we were eating, many diners started streaming in and the place became lively. We went to tour second floor of the restaurant filled with more super heros figurines. We spent about $92/- good deal for protein packed dinner!
5
While the restaurant has the usual super heroes figurines displayed, there are other decorations created in the local context, which are interesting. Read the news on the table when you are there!The food was nice. Better than another themed restaurant I visited a week earlier. I ordered too much though... The 2-3 persons' portion was enough for 2 adults and 2 kids

We often think that there's a trade-off between good food and a good looking place to eat in.Hungry Heroes is an exception.This evening was our 4th visit within one year, and all visits have been great.The food was great. The mix platter is wonderful for groups and families, and comes with ample condiments and sauces; and served in presentable boards and plates. Everything was cooked well and tasted great. We polished them in no time! The individual burgers were yummy too. The beef cheek was divine! The red wine was also good stuff. This evening was a birthday celebration attended by 10 adults and 3 kids, and everyone gave thumbs up for the food.The setting is one visual feast for everyone young and old. Bring your camera!Not always easy to get to be seated upstairs where there's more to see and photograph. The staff will open the 2nd floor only when the first floor is full, for good reason. Ask very nicely, and you might get lucky.The service has always been good. Staff were attentive and helpful. This evening, as we had a group reservation and really negotiated nicely for upper floor dining, we were assigned a dedicated service staff to attend to us. Aqsath was absolutely a darling. He helped my family member with her bags when she first arrived. He attended to our orders and brought them to the right guests without a single error. He gladly brought us our cake, and helped take photos. All of us were very impressed with Aqsath who was charmingly sweet and topped our birthday outing.Thank you Hungry Heroes! We'll be back again soon

Service is good. But food wise, it is average, especially karate bacon. Will not return again. Thanks.
3
the food was nice.
ambience was good too
the servers were v friendly.
however, the food was kinda expensive.
4
overall experience was good as it's my second visit. hope to have more food variety like pasta or soup cause it's easier for parents who bring along their kids for the meal.
5
Food is pretty tasty & pricing is reasonable. Ambience was really nice for a birthday celebration. Only thing is restaurant ran out of beer.
3
Everything was good. Atmosphere, services, food are all good. BUT the toilet was faulty on the day I went! It was flooded with water üòÖ
1
Food was average, pretty pricey. Obviously everyone is there for the design of superheroes and not the food. I even made a special request on having seat near the batman sculpture on the 2nd floor.Upon arrival, they gave me a seat on the ground level so I asked if I could have seat upstairs instead as I've made a request. The person who served us was like, "no, there is a private event going on". If that so, if they take their customers seriously, they should have at least send me an email or smth to let me know about it and probably I can change a date. But no..... even I requested to just go up and have a picture, was being turned down rudely and the server didn't even tried to help. They should reply consider taking their customers seriously.
3
It is my second time back to this place. The food and ambiance is really nice but the staffs there are not that pleasant. They need to be reminded to put on a smile and watch out for their tone. Not very pleasant service from their staffs. Hope this can be improved. Thank

Once a while, you regret buying a voucher from Chope but since you bought it, you're stuck with it. Hungry Heroes fit this bill perfectly. From the moment you step in, their unfriendliness starts to bother you. It doesn't let up till you walk out of the door. That's my overwhelming perception of Hungry Heroes. Sorry nothing good from me this round
5
Hungry Heroes has really great decor that's for sure! From 12" Toys to full Life-size statues of your favourite Marvel and DC superheroes and cool posters everywhere. If you want a memorable location this is it! Chairs and tables were big. Did not feel cramped at all.Food was good and was to be expected for a cafe such as this and the price point. Portions were generous and my GF and I were full after our meals and this was us on an empty stomachs.Their starred item of Heroes Fries was really good.Drinks were also neat, we both had ciders that were of unique origin and not easily found at most other cafes. Though what was a tad bit disappointing was that they had no more craft beer left when we went for dinner on a Sunday night (F1 Weekend no less), but still, we really enjoyed the Ciders and the bottles were big for the price.Overall a great experience

My party of 8, all decked out in superhero tees, reached the restaurant feeling all cheery and excited, only to be met by a sullen-faced female server who hardly bothered to greet us. When we asked politely if we could be seated on the second level, she very uninterestedly replied that we could not. When my mum asked a second time privately if an exception could be made for my birthday, she curtly replied "No." We understand that the restaurant has an SOP of only opening up the second level later, but it was her rude attitude that dampened our moods greatly. Even when the friendly manager promised to "do something about it" after we told him our unhappiness, there was no follow up and we did not hear from him again after. Your food was not bad, but service can definitely be a lot better than this. Won't be coming back if this is the standard of service you provide
4
Been almost a year since I went back to the restaurant. It doesn't look any different except the staff, of course. Food wise, taste is as good. My only grouse this trip is the food is not as pipping hot as my previous visit.
4
Food spread was good and nice ambiance to chill out with friends. Good place for gathering in big group :)
3
Good ambience! Enjoyable food and fascinating interior. Though food was on the pricier side, good for a fancy date/ outing.
4
A very nice place for gatheting. Brought friends who are1st time tbere and commented very nice place.
5
Very very delicious burger and the Super heroes figurines made the ambience very good, When we went upstair, we were really shocked by the effort of the owner especially the ceiling light with more than 100 figurines
5
Ordered the nice to meet you platter for family of 4. Its awesome! Staff was helpful and guided us on the menu. Nice ambience.

We visited this place in Dec 2016 for dinner .. for a birthday celebration.Whilst it is located in a non-centralised non-busy area, it is still very accessible via public transport. The nearest MRT station is Little India.Thereafter, just a short 10 min walk.The 2 storey restaurant is housed in an oldish looking shophouse in the Little India area.The decor alone, in my view, is enough to occupy your attention for the whole time you are dining there.Hence, you would actually appreciate the time the chefs take to prepare the food you have ordered.Mainly because you have a chance to look at & review every detail of the decor which ranges from Marvel & DC Comic Book posters, figurines of superheroes like Iron Man, Batman,Superman, The Incredible Hulk, Spiderman, Captain America and many others.Some of them are life-size figurines, strung up from the ceiling and inclined against the wall.The menu is "superhero"-formatted too .. much to my delight.Apart from the regular superheroes, I found posters/pictures of Bruce Lee, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Hitman & others.It is a Superheroes Haven for Marvel/DC comic book enthusiasts.The food was great too.We had the Hungry Heroes Platter - The "Steak-Out", which serves 5-6 people. a mix of pork rib, pulled pork, chicken, sausages, bangers, slab of beef, belly pork, french cries, beef con carne.It would be heavenly for meat lovers .. too.I recommend this to the young comic fans as well as "young@heart" who grew up on a "diet" of Marvel/DC comics. You'll never be disappointed.*** Advice: Make a reservation for an early dinner, eg 6pm. Then arrive earlier than that. If you have the whole place to yourself, ie no one around, that would be best and most opportune for you to explore every nook & cranny, take and pose with every posted, figurine that you fancy **
3
Apart from the decor of this place, there's nothing that'll draw me back for another visit.Service staff are not friendly, not approachable and in fact, aren't really service-oriented.Food is very straightforward - ribs or burgers. They do have some selection of chicken and fish but otherwise, it's really just ribs and burgers. Nothing to shout about especially the kids items - which by the way is a disgrace when I saw the chicken tenders which was more of over fried chicken!Pricing is on the high side for the grub
4
This was my 2nd visit and this time I brought my daughter and nephews. The taste of the foods are good and filling. The price is reasonable and the waiters were friendly. In addition, there are many Super Heroes figurines, portraits, etc. too. We really enjoyed ourselves.
5
I was here this evening with a small group of friends for a celebratory meal and we had so much fun. The service was exceptional - not a common thing in Singapore - with humour, speed and efficiency. The food was excellent value for money. We shared a $66 Nice To Meat You platter between three - probably enough for four really - our veggie friends had huge portobello mushroom burgers and a doesn't-share-food friend had a Spider Pig burger. All great value for money. Happy hour, before 8pm, also offers really good value including $34 bottles of decent wine. This place is all about the very cool decor though. It's head-to-toe superheroes and action figures, from life sized Thor and Iron Man behind the bar and Batman/Superman upstairs, to probably quite valuable figurines mounted on the walls and an alarming array of (fake) weapons. There's a very cute polar bear tap up in the ladies toilets. The upstairs is only opened when it's busy but it's worth a nose around for more cool comic book collectibles, and the superheroes conference table which large groups can reserve for a minimum spend. This would be a great place for a kids party, or for a fun grown up event. Who doesn't love superheroes? Really good value, lovely staff, tasty and generous food and a generally fun atmosphere.
5
We ordered the cheeseburger, fish burger and chicken burger...And the chicken wings for Heroes (warning - hottest in town). Food was delicious and staff were friendly.
5
Such a refreshing environment of comic heros, guns and posters.
It's a good place for families and group outings.
We had the platter, chicken burger, pull pork, steak, mash, luncheon fries. They were delicious.
4
Nice ambience
Food was good but pricey given it's mainly evolving around fried items
Good customer service by the lady serving us
5
Comfortable environment, not too crowded and u can get to take photos off their marvel toy, guns and portraits collections .
5
We went there to celebrate our son's birthday. The place was very cool with many exquisite collectibles. Food was very very nice! Definitely a great place for family to dine!
3
Be wowed by the design of this place on both storeys. Portions were decently filling. Check this one out!
4
Location of this restaurant is a little out of place (I mean it's not in town) & it's not wheelchair friendly, but, if you like to interact with life-sized Superman, Captain America, Thor....this is a right place to go. We brought our 80 year-old parents to this place to celebrate my mum's birthday and they thoroughly enjoyed looking at the life-sized statues and the food. We ordered the Communal Meat Platter-The Steak Out for 4-5 persons. There were 5 of us but I think this dish could feed up to 6 persons! The pork ribs, chicken leg, truffle mash were very tasty. The beef at medium rare was too tough and the beef chilli con carne has a too beefy smell. ZQ, the very polite waiter or manager? recommended that we try Clash of the Potato, Mayo and Scallions. This dish of baby potatoes cooked in duck fat is absolutely delicious. We will return to try more of their other stuf
4
Really like the ambience and vibe. Fun, chilled yet sophisticated! Ice lemon tea on point But we're here for the burgers right? Haha. Both my partner and I had the cheese burger; taste-wise we were slightly disappointed. Dont get me wrong, It was good but just not outstanding. Everything else But for the price, I feel the taste can def be improved on! Subjective though!
1
we used a special voucher too and were treated as third class citizens... given a short selection of 5 items instead of the full menu which consisted way more than 5 items! because we used their voucher program! how rude!! then our dishes were cleared when we weren't finished and the restaurant was EMPTY. serviettes which we needed were taken away! if the restaurant was not genuine or happy about the use of voucher they should NOT join the voucher program! could never recommend this place to anyone - it's too embarrassing! the 5 items we could choose from were horrible! must be their WORST selling items. in the end we had the pulled pork burger which my kids choked down and cried the whole time choking it down because it was FOUL tasting. bangers and mash must be cooked a new way where it is served COLD in this place. all the food gave us a tummyache by the time we left. terrible experience. terrible aggressive service where it's NOT the customer is right at all. AVOID this place. once u get past the 5 minutes of novelty from the decor, you will hate it. overpriced crappy food n servic
1
Truly disappointing experience.The menu was pricey for the quality of food. Really bad service, with a rude male service staff that was very impolite and had an impatient tone when speaking with us. Also had rolled his eyes a couple of times when we enquired about usage of a voucher that had been provided by the restaurant
5
I only wrote to reserve a table for 2 for my bf birthday dinner. They provided cute stickers and birthday candles served for the dinner. Not only suprised my bf, they surprised me with their excellent and professional service. Thank you!
4
Very Nice interior and decors. Manage to get to sit on level 2 for dinner. Foods taste delicious. Service staffs are friendly. Using Chope voucher.
4
Good food with very nice ambience. Many Super heroes figures and my kids love the ribs. Food is real good for a theme restaurant, who say theme restaurant cannot serve decent nice food!
4
The decorations were interesting and good to go for date to try out new places.
Food was not too bad.
4
The staff offer excellent services.
He would advice to ensure you don't order too much.
This was our 2nd visit. Thumb up!!!!
5
Visited during my son's birthday. Nice decoration, cozy environment and yummy food. Overall, we will come again next time
4
A Fantastic Quirky Super Hero Themed restaurant. Great for family and kids. Big portions and nice place for pic.
4
Food, ambient and service are all nice.
Love the heroes, guns and the place.
Just slightly pricey. Very recommend!
4
Went there for my son's birthday. He was very surprised the moment he stepped in. Great deco, well thought out. Even the toilet is in gold color! We ordered the steak out set plus a few sides. Food was good and better than I expected. Only feedback I have is the bacon which was a little dry and tough. Perhaps replacing with normal bacon would work better. Staff were attentive and friendly. Son had a candle and some stickers from the staff. Highly recommend this place. Singapore needs more places like this
4
Sharing of ‚ÄòNice to Meet You‚Äô, you could taste the Sirlion Steak, Pulled Pork, Chicken, Pork Ribs and fries with two different sauces (i.e. good to have Wasabi sauce for chicken and brown sauce for steak). You may complete the meal with the Ice Cream Brownie.Level 1 will be busy and a bit ‚Äònoisy‚Äô, level 2 is more cozy for chatting.Staff are attentive and friendly. It is good for celebrating birthday!
4
Love the truffle mashed potatoes sausage! Food with good quality .And nice environment . Will go back again!
4
I like the beef burger, not so much of the pork. Restaurant is quite pricey. Spent about $50 for 2 without ordering drinks
5
My 1st try in this cafe, will visit in next time. Super Love the deco, superman, ironman, batman‚Ä¶ Nice taste for the food. The portion quite a lot üëçüòÇ
4
The deco with super heroes are unique. This cafe suits family with kids & super heroes lover. We only tried snacks not main course, no comment on the snacks. Will visit again.
4
If you are superhero lover, please visit hungry heroes. Deco: Alot of superheros figurines. Food: The food is nice but nothing special. There is no superhero theme on the food deco.
5
Brought my boyfriend there for his birthday dinner because he's a marvel fan, not only did he love the place but he loved the food and the waiters put a candle in his burger and gave him a postcard and stickers! Super loved it, they were so lovely
4
tables are not wide enough for comfort tho seats are big and look majestic. the food is really good for the special menu but a tad expensive. too bad they cant be used in conjunction with any promotions. a separate menu that can be used with entertainer app must be specifically requested which is inconvenient and misleading as one's instinct would be everything in the main menu is what is available. even if i want to spend less, the choices are limited to what i see. but the other menu contains much affordable items yet had to be specially requested. the service can be good, can be mediocre, depends on day and person. bottom line, would visit more if food is priced lower or more variety of selection that can be used with the entertainer app
4
I went there with my nephew and ordered the "Nice to Meat You" platter for 2 - 3, "a lil bit of everything" for good measure, comprising a selection of half-rack pork ribs, sirloin, de-boned chicken, and pulled pork, complete with coriander honey and lemon aioli sauce out of the four (the other two are brown sauce and cajun mayo). We loved it -- the chicken, the ribs and the pulled pork -- especially the chicken which was tender and savoury. The beef was a little average though. We also ordered the wings and the Captain Caesar salad for the greens. The wings were spicy, we were warned, but we loved the kick. The salad came in a colourful vibrant display -- the kids would have loved it.Though there was a sign outside saying that the restaurant is short-handed and it appeals for patience, we found the service to be prompt and pleasing.
5
Staff service really fantastic and attentive. We ordered brownies for dessert and when wanted a second dessert staff exactly asked us if we are too full cos if not we can't finished.Luckily heed his advice. Brownie was not to the standard cos was over baked and burnt which we feedback not asking for refund or anything becos we finished the ice cream that came with brownie. Next min we knew the service staff removed the charge thanking us for giving the feedback. Food was really not too bad for American food. This is my second visit and I sure will return again.

Was looking forward to the evening's dinner with friend. Arrived during the early hours & there was only 1 client. The decor was impressive. However, the "Wow" factor ends there sadly & the entire evening went downhill all the way.Both service staff was unattentive & just remained seated at the counter preoccupied with their hps. Had to call them in order to take order (typically in restaurants, the waiters will be attentive in taking orders). The entire 1st level felt stuffy & warm as the air-con was barely felt (perhaps attempts were made to save energy but spoils the dining experience as the place felt warm & uncomfortable despite the fact that it was drizzling outside).The meal arrived & food tasted unremarkably normal (probably also marred by the stuffiness of the place). The 2 staff who was not attending to any customer remained unoccupied & seated at the counter & did not make any attempts to perhaps top up water for the 2 tables. The bill for the evening came up to $80++ and it was only for 2 mains, with no drinks. Overall, could have obtained better quality food, more attentive service & even better air-con ambience elsewhere since there are many top notch restaurants at this price range or lesser.Sadly, the novelty of the place will not be attractive enough to garner a return trip
5
Awesome ambience and coz I went on weekday night its less crowded so my toddler was wowed by the theme. Food wise- buttered corn (for my boy) was great, pan seared salmon nice, pork ribs too. The chicken wings were too salty though.
4
the place is nice and service is good...food was good too but nothing fantastic.
place was easy to find too and the deco was so cool
4
Went for Valentine dinner. The Valentine menu was value for money.
Huge portion and came with either red/white wine or beer.
Due to more diner on Valentine's, food took longer than expected but still within reasonable time.
5
went on Sat night and ordered "Nice to Meat You". food quality was good and quantity enough for two. 2nd floor seemed to be the best photo zone with colorful decoration and figures.
4
Food portion is huge. Environment is cosy. However, there had a event on that day at upstair, a bit noisy.
5
Kids loved the place. Food was good and reasonnable. Service was great. Will go again if have guests in town. Fun place to hangout.
5
Ambience was great. Unfortunately we went when there was an event going on on the 2nd level, hence it was a tad noisy. Otherwise, it was a great experience.
3
It's not hard to notice the amount of hardwork taken for the reno. But can't say the same for the service and food wise. Pork rib was good and that's abt it. Went as a grp of 4 served by 3 different server and sad to say only 1 provided acceptable service. A caf√É¬© w price not on the low side.. u would be expecting better service.
2
Received a call on day of booking to be informed that table space has to be given up by 8pm. This was not communicated at point of online booking. Food could be better prepared. It tasted bland and felt like it was pre prepared and heated. Bill was almost slapped down on our table without prior indication. It will not hurt to tap my shoulder and politely present the bill. Felt very much like being shooed away. At that juncture, restaurant was still pretty empty. Very unpleasant experience. Which is a shame because I had a good time the first time I was there.
5
Amazing place with gorgeous Marcel characters. Awesome food as well! Service was fast and prompt, food came just when we finished taking photos of the place. Staff was friendly and funny as well, making jokes with us and all. Highly recommended to visit! Will go back again next time..:) wonderful experience
4
Great place for kids. Portions are good. The only down side is that some items in the menu are not available. The platter for sharing is great and and luncheon chips are sinful :)
4
Interior is well done. Food and drinks are great! Worth visiting! Place is rather small so do make reservations.
4
can be a little cold. the food is generally all served well prepared and pretty fast. the double patty chicken burger is quite a bomb. overall decent.
3
Very well decorated, obviously a selling point of the place.
Spider pig burger was pretty good but chicken leg smelt bad..
4
Food was good, although it was quite disappointing that many menu items were sold out. Overall ambience and decor of the place is very unique and nice!
4
Not many people know this restaurant, yet. However the first time I visited this restaurant, it amazed me. So many collection of super heroes. The first level of the restaurant has classic and elegant interior, the second level is more artistic with vibrant color touch. They allow outside birthday cake provided all guests have a main meal there. Food are good, well presented, service is good. Give it a try. Cheers
5
Went for a birthday dinner at Hungry Heroes. I read tripadvisor reviews and it was all good reviews and true to that, we had a good time at this restaurant as well. From the life size heros' and cute washrooms taps, it was overall a fantastic experience and was all my kids could talk about for weeks after. Special thanks to the wait staff on the 2nd level. She was so fast, efficient with a genuine smile! I was impressed with her efficiency be it, with the orders or clearing out the tables. Kudos to the management for having such a dedicated employee. The food was equally mouth watering and delicious. We had rib eye steak, burgers, pork ribs and all the dishes were excellent. This will be one of my family to-go for restaurant for sure!Keep it up, Hungry Heroes
4
It has now become an annual visit (at least) for my family when they return from overseas. The service is great and the decorations of the restaurant is always the main topic of our conversations. I do hope that they will have more choices for my little nephews so that they can enjoy the visit more. The kids' meals are very limited
3
5 of us went with high expectations judging by the reviews and photos.Food was just ok with one dish returned (chicken leg) as it was poor quality and undercooked...nothing like the menu described. Rib eye was so so and burgers same. The venue is awesome just let down by the food and miserable staf
1
I can't understand how come this resto no wifi available. I can't call any uber after dinner. And the waitress dont even want to give any help to call us taxi.I think thats cruel as they leave us stand outside cafe waiting for taxi at 10.00 pm. For information, we bring our 2 yo baby and my 63 yo mother. That night i must take a walk to main road to catch a taxi. Even the taxi driver can suggest us to not back again.My advice, never visit this place if you think will ride a taxi on your back. The place is in lonely road with arogan waitress
5
A great place to feel ur super powers. Be treated as how you love to treated. Feel ur powers, as you eat.
5
Action heroes, booze, and meat, perfect place for a celebration for the dudes or anybody who loves to dine in a quirky place.
4
food was decent - enjoyed the beef and chicken especially as compared to the lamb and pork. ambience was cool but staffs were not very friendl
5
Great food, awesome cool place! I booked a table for dinner for two. My friend likes Deadpool and the DC/Marvel thing, unfortunately no Deadpool stuff! But the food was amazing. Deco impressive.
4
Hungry Heroes is the superhero fan come true! Decorated with numerous original and licensed superhero memorabilia from Marvel and other comics, life-sized superhero statues, head busts, and action figurines, the cafe is perfect for any comic book fan.
4
beef cheek is very tender and a great complement however they were not pipin' hot or anywhere close. the double patty chicken burger is awesome but can't they have a single patty option too?
4
Ordered nice 2 meat u set, beef cheese fries with 2 1litre root beer float. It was very satisfying. Pulled pork was abit salty but overall was good and yummy!
Inconvenient location when raining as there's no shelter.
4
Think this is the 4th time I'm back here...food is still good. You can get a decent & full meal...the price you pay is worth it too.
3
I have been to Hungry Heroes a few times now and always enjoy the food. However, on my latest visit I was rather disappointed by the service. We had a 9:30 reservation and while in the taxi over to the restaurant I received a call saying that the kitchen closes at 9:45 (even though the place is open until 11). We were only a couple of minutes away so we decided to go anyway despite the rush.Upon arrival, we were given menus and told to order immediately. We decided on our food in a couple of minutes and were ready to order. However, the waitress was at the counter just talking to another employee and refused to turn around. We spent several minutes trying to get her attention so we could place our orders before this apparently urgent time deadline. It was completely unnecessary to so rudely rush us to order and then completely ignore our table (it wasn't because of busyness as there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant). Even though it was the end of the night there was no reason for the staff to be impatient, rude and negligent. We were also given no forewarning that the kitchen was going to close almost immediately after our reservation time. It would have been useful to have known this ahead of time, when making the reservation or more than 5 minutes before arrival. The dinner was not as enjoyable because we felt pressured to eat quickly and leave despite the fact that the restaurant is open until 11pm.
5
If you love comic books, this is the restaurant for you! The first Superhero and Pop Art Themed Restaurant. Not too far from Farrer Park MRT or if you are driving, there is parallel parking lots just across the street from the restaurant. We had the Steak-Out platter that was really filling. Comes with two bangers, full rack of pork ribs, a slice of ribeye beef steak, deboned chicken thigh, a huge piece of bacon, fries, truffle mash (some of us didn't really like it because there was a strong taste) and beef chili. Great sharing platter and there's the floats that are huge (1L). Overall, a great experience. Do remember to make reservations by calling them or through Chope where you can take advantage of pre-paid vouchers! Alternatively, check with them for bank discounts.
2
Only for kids experience, price is too high, and location is not convenience too. hard to go again without any promotions
4
Love the space on the 2nd floor. Food was nice though perhaps a tad expensive for the portion. Experience was generally nice.
5
burger was value for money, great deal, nice atmosphere. will visit again.
bring your family along, young or old, they will love it.
1
-staff not attentive, using mobile phones while customer calling for take orders.
-staff showing attitude faces
-food very salty
-staff not willing to help when needed.
4
this is my second time at hungry hero,food portion is big and the price is very reasonable as well,Recommend
4
Had a good time dining here! Will be back soon with my boys! Thumbs up for the gd service and clean eating place
4
Nice ambience, good service, nice food.
There are food available for vegetarian as well.
It will be good if food can have superheroes decoration as well.

Vegetarians beware! Hungry Heroes is the perfect feast for meat-lovers with a delicious menu impressive comic book decorations. From life-size figurines to movie posters, the superhero collection is very impressive. We had the Bangers and Mash and chicken burger, both were huge portions and delicious! They also have all sorts of promotions going on all the time, including UOB, Chope, Maybank, and NETS. Service was super fast and we received our food in under 10 minutes.

We love the cool ambience and the delicious food. We had Bacon karate Chop, Meat Fury's BBQ pork ribs and deep fried luncheon Chips. We were surprised for this kind of Theme restaurant the food were above average and suits our palates. The best of all was the luncheon chips which was not too salty. We love the big superman, batman and all the super heroes. We will be back
4
Warmly greeted and served by service staff, believe he is full time and very attentive. Ordered the ribeye and ribs. Surprisingly food was good as well, on contrary to usual perception that concept cafes are only "good to see but don't serve good food" ! Will come back again to try other items on the menu. Used the entertainer 1for1, so it's even more value for money!!
4
Service was prompt and staff were friendly. We had the 'nice to meat you' platter which was not too bad, will be better if the pulled pork was not so dry and tough! Overall pleasant experience!
3
Wrong drinks served. Staff standing around talking openly. Sitting directly in front of staffs speaking about their own topics although we were the only customer around it wasn't comfortable at all. Overall probably good kinda pricey food & excellent atmosphere but won't visit again.
5
My boyfriend loves the figurines in the cafe, said the food tasted great too! Overall, we enjoyed the place!
4
Good ambience and exquisite decorations. Staff was helpful and accommodating. Good was alright but slightly pricey. Kids loved the place. Great family dinner outing.
5
We went for a early dinner. Our reservation was at 530pm. I would recommend to go at this timing because there was no customers at all and you could walk around the restaurant and take pictures. The food was nice! Value for money!
4
It's for heroes alright. Great decor, very nice and friendly staff. Good food and wine. Pretty relaxing, tucked away in a quiet part at the far end of Little India.
4
Food was great, very delicious and portion stated for sharing was accurate as well. Awesome interior design and located quite near to Farrer park mrt, 5-10 min walk. Service staff were really friendly as well. Ang they've also accommodated our special requests as well so that was really nice
4
My friends and i enjoyed the Heroes Fries alot! My friend ordered a Sirloin, however it's kinda raw at certain parts.. And the restaurant is really kind enough to replace her with a new piece of steak.. Service is good, restaurant is well decorated with all the superhero collections too
3
The main reason why we visited the restaurant was its collection of Avengers and Justice League heroes. The setup is nice for children who are into Marvel, and service was prompt. Try burgers instead of sirloin steak and spaghetti was in generous portion, thought a bit too salty.
5
First time to this Superhero theme restaurant. Tucked away in a small lane... thus away from the hustle and bustle .... Love the super hero theme deco...nicely done.. food was good and the platter we ordered was good enough for a family of three to share.... initially the place was full and they did not have a table and only had high table outside .. as we requested for a normal table Renee who served us went out of the way to find us a table and ensured we were comfortable.. Thank you for the great service !! Highly recommended for a family outing.. Keep up the good work 
4
Visited with friends and we had spicy pork ribs , the roast burger and yuzu cheesecake. Pork ribs tasted yummy and the meat was tender. Chicken burger was great too.
5
Awesome food overall. Especially the beef cheeks with truffle mash. Staff were very friendly too. Definitely worth the price.
4
I love the restaurant so much as the dining atmosphere is awesome.
and the food is yummy and affordable too. We will be going again !
5
my squad enjoyed the original and miso ribs, honey corriander dips is unforgettable, truffle mash has is just right not too overpowering, and nicely done cheeseburger . Root beer float all round without fail.
5
great place to hold events. interesting and kids will love this place. food is good, better than expected. service was good too.
4
Salad was kind of limpy, otherwise all was good. Service was great. I like the fact that it wasn't super crowded.
5
We were briefly brought to seats upon arrival. Staff was attentive, prompt & polite throughout. The pan-seared chicken breast was really succulent & not dry at all! Signature Pork ribs was really good as well! We kept ourselves occupied with photo takings of the interior before food was served rather promptly. Very satisfied experience & will definitely visit again
4
Good food value for money and service staff was very polite and helpful! Overall very satisfied. Portion is huge, and price is reasonable for the amount of meat given. Definitely needed a second visit to try out other menu items. Cafe interior is unique too; great for superheroes fans!! Perhaps would be better for them to provide a more extensive dessert menu for dessert-lovers! All in all, experience was a good one.
5
A really fun restaurant with great American food. The burgers are delicious! The service from the staff was excellent and in particular our waiter Jerome could not have done more for us, he was fab! Thanks for a great meal!
3
Brought my family and the kids were v excited at seeing the many figurines and life-sized models of Captain America, Batman etc. Had a good time taking pics of the place. Overall a nice experience although food is pretty average. The Rooster burger is not bad and worth the calories! Tried the ribs too and found the dish pretty standard and does not really stand out.
4
We had a meet up with our friends. First outdoor outing since our babies arrived last year. The food was good and the ambience was conducive.
3
Celebrate my son's birthday at the hero theme restaurant. Food portion was okay. Their fried luncheon meat fries was normal. nothing to shout out. We ordered their platter for two, not really nice. too much meat and the steak is too overly-cooked. They do not have any special birthday arrangement for bday boy. I thought a plate with a small cupcake with candle would be nice. Staff seems to be busy all the time, not much attention to diners. Seats were rather cramp on the first floor. Overall good if you are herofans. If u are looking for service or good food, think there are better out there U can use safra card for ala carte meals
4
Excellent food but limited variety. No soup. Excellent service. However most of the figuring are too block and hard to take photo
4
Awesome food with excellent service and nice decoration. Recommended for family and friends who want a nice place to chill and chat
5
Happy with the food and decor. Pricing could be more competitive for a joint that is out of town but hey with the d√É¬©cor, makes me a kid again. Go heroes
4
Very impressive decor with superheroes! Food is not bad too! The ribs were really good. Beef cheeks had a gamey smell, so takes a little appreciation.
3
Food was ok, ambience and staff were great. Quite pricey though....may go back if the Budget is high
5
Held a team bonding of 19 pax at Hungry Heros n it was a marvellous nite for all.Great food n Wonderful ambience!Thanks to manager ZQ n staff for the Excellence service too
4
Nice restaurant, good atmosphere.. BUT no place for parking... need to park very far at old HDB area with NO gantry, must prep parking coupons
3
The decor was good. Esp for Marvel fans. I am not but I was impressed. The staff were helpful. The food, however, came out cold - only the fries were hot
4
2nd visit for Bro in law birthday dinner. Great place for gathering and decoration was power as I'm a super hero lover. I wish to have some poster back to my house. Lol. Friendly and helpful staff. Definitely will go for 3rd visit.
4
Revisit the place with another group of friend, nicely decorated place with all the life-size figures. Food is good but would hope for some dessert menus. Otherwise, worth the trip down
5
- Close to Farrer Park MRT- Unique Decor, Super Hero Theme- Friendly staff- Quick service even with other tables around- Pulled Pork Burger is to die for!- Fun unique drinks and table menuFor something different and a place with good food and friendly staff, fly into this restaurant for food that will save your day ;)Would recommend this to people who love comics and good food.Family friendly too
5
food was ok and the service was good. Nice western food and great ambience. We tried the ribeye steak and cheese burger. Cheese burger was done better :
3
Environment was nice.. spider pork burger not bad.. but the bacon karate chop is not worth at all.. just 2 slices of meat (over-charged).. staff attitude not very good.. will not go back again..
4
We had dinner here and we like the ambience. Owner spent alot of efforts in decorating the restaurant. The Nice to Meat You platter is awesome. The service is good (surprisingly as I read some comments that the service is not so good). Remember to make a reservation or else have to wait. Bon appetit
2
The decorations are nice, food are way better than our expectation. However the service really poor, one stuff just gave us totally black face while service us. The service not as well thought from customer point of view
3
The food was alright, pricing was affordable too. Interior's quite interesting. The only down side was the service. it was bad. pretty bad.
4
The decor of the place was done very tastefully and reminds me of the Wayne manor (Batman). Super hero posters, busts and figurines were everywhere and my son had a fun time gawking at everything.Food portions for kids meal were HUGE and can probably feed 2 small eaters. My hubby and I had the sharing platter and this was pretty decent too. The only downside was the service: staff were very polite but should smile more often. We were told when we arrived that all the tables were full and there were only outdoor seats available. But shortly after that the staff told us there will be a table leaving very soon and we were asked to wait. When we got in, i saw empty tables which were supposedly 'reserved'. These tables were still empty when we finished dinner and left 2 hours later.....Overall a great place to hang out with friends
5
Excellent place for all wake oh lives. Recommand for dinner as ambient is nice. But have to park your car at the public car park along the road sid
5
Service is superb. I'd highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who'd like to have nice cozy catch up, gatherings be it friends or family. Thumbs up üëçüèº
4
Love the ambience and loved the food. While waiting for the food to arrive, there were things to do at the restaurant such as taking photos of the exhibits.
4
the restaurant was located at a convenient distance from the mrt, decorated with cool figurines and most importantly the food is nice!
4
Awesome experience dining with the various figurines. It's like going to a marvel superhero museum! The food is tasteful and nicely plated. Had an awesome time snapping pictures of the beautiful place. House pour wines are decent and only $7 a glass during happy hour.
2
one of the poorest service quality level I've experienced for a restaurant. No smiles, no please and thank you. Food quality is good and arrived very promptly. Restaurant design, setup is great.However, wouldn't be coming back because the service staff just destroyed the whole dining experience. If only they know how to smile..
4
Initially was skeptical that the restaurant will be in the "looks good, tastes bad" category. But the platter we ordered for 4 was soooo good; RIbs, steak, bacon, chicken leg, shredded pork. One thing was that the tables were arranged too closely and wasn't private enough; probably to save space.Will definitely recommend
5
Despite the small interior, every part of the restaurant is decorated beautifully to suit the superheroes theme. Even the toilet! The ambience, food and service were all great and the overall experience was rather memorable. Definitely recommend! (P.S. It's pricey, ~$30, so do prepare your wallets!)
4
Thought the restaurant would be known more for the deco rather than the food, but surprisingly, the food was rather good! Had the Luncheon Chips and Truffle Mash to start. The luncheon chips was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and not too oily. Wife was not a fan of luncheon meat and she liked this too! The truffle mash was on the bland side and I must say the truffle mash was disappointing.Next we had the Bacon Karate Chop and the Spider Pig Burger. The Bacon was off the charts, alternating layers of meat and collagen cooked to perfection. Every bite was satisfying, and while the collagen (or fats?) looked really unhealthy, it really didn't taste all that fatty. Spider pig was a generous serving of shredded pork shoulder and was tasty and juicy. The mains were rather filling, and I must say the service staff were spot on with their recommendation.While it was a busy seating on FAthers Day, the service staff were friendly and attentive, and spared no efforts in helping to keep our little toddler entertained with the constant waves and smiles while we dug into the meal.Will definitely be back for some of the other interesting items on the men
4
Visited with 2 toddlers on a weekday and it wasn't crowded. Sat on ground level and was fascinated by the figurines and posters plastered around. Wasn't expecting much but the food was really good! My 4yo boy had the pork bolognaise, I had the spicy pork ribs and my husband ordered the pulled pork burger. Portions are healthy and we had a good time. Will definitely return!
4
Decoration is nice and food is good. Location is a little out of place and choice of sides is quite limited! Very cosy place for one to rest after work
4
Food is nice plus awesome decoration on the wall. Location is not so near mrt but still very easy to find. Will definitely come back.
4
I love the potato salad - Clash of the potatoes, they tasted so good with bacon and scallions. The pork ribs were too sweet for my liking, but my friends enjoyed them. Had the bacon karate chop as well and it's very good, would recommend anyone to try it. You can pass the Cesar salad as it was nothing fancy, the salad given with the main course were way better. You have to visit restaurant to see all the efforts put into decorating the place - super love! My friends had an unforgettable experience there celebrating her bday :
5
We had a wonderful experience at Hungry Heroes recently. The deco at the place was awesome and the food and service were very good. The beef cheeks simply melted in my mouth and all of us the chicken tenders so much that we had to order again for my girls. Keep up the great job and we gonna be back soon..
1
It's our first visit to Hungry Heroes and probably the last. Food was.. well OKAY. Pull pork was a dry heap of shredded meat. The rest were fine.We made our reservation for 5 through CHOPE at 12pm. We are not aware that the restaurant opens only at 12pm. We were 10 mins early. Noticing that someone was inside the restaurant, my husband walked in only to be greeted by an arrogant staff. While my hubby was trying to inform him that we had a reservation, the staff was walking towards the door while 'pushing' my hubby backwards as if he was driving him out of the restaurant. His body language tells it all.We were told to wait OUTSIDE while they get our table READY. After 5 mins, we were sweaty from the heat and I went in and requested to wait inside instead. The same staff (stout bespectacled) said this to me: NORMALLY WE DO NOT ENCOURAGE OUR CUSTOMERS TO COME SO EARLY. My jaw dropped while looking straight at his face. He went on to say that by doing so, we will have to wait in the heat and furthermore, the restaurant is not at its full capacity that day.Whether your restaurant is operating at full capacity does not matter to us. He could have invited us to wait INSIDE the restaurant. Table not ready? That's fine. We can be served water first or at least given the menu to browse?We were led to our table on the 2nd floor and given the menu. (In fact THE TABLE WAS ALREADY PREPPED as there were NO other staff around). No one served us water. BECOS BESIDES THIS RUDE STAFF, THERE WERE NO OTHER STAFF INSIGHT. 2 of the crew only sauntered up after 12 noon, wearing their staff apron while walking up the stairs. My hubby and kids helped themselves to the water. When dishes arrived, we have to tell your staff to provide side plates. The staff seems not ready to start working. (Probably still sleepy). Our visit was meant to celebrate my kid's birthday. It's nothing special for our family. In future, I will think twice on being a restaurant's 1st customer
4
The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and the staff were friendly and prompt in their service. We enjoyed the fried boneless chicken wings as they were served hot. We felt that the mains were served not as warm as we had expected. Good if this could be improved further
4
Celebrated a young 4-year old's birthday. He was thrilled to be in this restaurant with Batman Superman Ironman and all the other heroes. The menu items have very fancy names following the hero theme.The servicestaff were very patient especially since the children were running around excitedly. Food portions are slightly above average so we were all pretty stuffed after dinner not to mention the birthday cake with spiderman on it.Located opposite the Civil Service Club, getting to the restaurant was a bit inconvenient. There is no sheltered carpark and the nearest parking lots are by the road and rather limited. The nearest train station is probably Farrer Park and that would still require a 10 minute walk at least
5
Celebrated my boy's birthday with our Marvel day out theme, marvel movie and finally dinner at hungry Heros; fantastic choice of restaurant! The mega burger was huge and meat patty is thick and solid; totally worth the $$! Fish burger was just passable though.
4
There seem to be short of staff on the second level. Everyone should visit this place, overall its a good experience! Staffs were friendly and interior design of the cafe was grea
5
Service gd. Food average. Atmosphere gd. The heroes and cartoon characters are really nice.. my kids love the place.
4
We ordered the meaty ribs which is excellently marinated and fresh. The meat is so tender that it fell off the bones cleanly. Awesome! But the bacon steak is not that great. Just go for the ribs + pulled pork
5
It was a family dinner, my son love the location as it was full of his favourite characters. The set course was jus right for the 3 of us, and the food was good. I will recommend this place to other friends.
4
Well done to the team although short handed with a full house!
Great food with attentive staff!
Burger would be even better if it was home made
4
The children enjoy the atmosphere, and adults too. Food portion was value for money... Ordered "steak out" for 5-6 pax. Personal recommend heroes fries
4
I really like the setting of the restaurant. It was a total plus point when you make a visit there. Food preparation is really fast. Staff were all very attentive. Food is definitely above average, pretty value for money.
4
Good ambience and friendly staffs. Food slightly above average and price is pretty ok with the food portion.
3
We are more health concerns family. We prefers to have more healthy food... mean more options for not fried food. For kids meal 100% fried food. My gal totally do not eat as she prefers pasta. So I pass my pasta to her
4
Must try it - NICE TO MEET YOU PLATTER(Pork Ribs, Pulled Pork, Sirlion, De-Boned Chicken), Norwegian Salmon, Root Beer Float
3
Amidst the current most talk about Marvel's latest film - 'Civil War'; it is a great time to drop by 'Hungry Heroes' to be completely immense in to the hype. The restaurant is well-furnished with many life-sized prominent superheroes figures. It kind of amused me to spot a few superheroes goers coming in dining with marvel/d.c. tops. Haha!Food was not exactly fantastic but passable; portion for their mains are served generously! Foodies with huge appetite should give their 'Mother of all Chicken Burgers' a shot.The restaurant seemed to be facing a slight understaffed situation; therefore be patient to get your attention noticed as well as the speed of food being served.Overall, pretty interesting dining experience, definitely worth a one-time visit (doubt I would visit the second time though)
3
Expected more from this place and set up. Basic service and food was nothing well thought out. Had the burger and the parties has too much fillers and ended tasting like cheap sausage
5
Hungry heroes food is AWESOME. Also good for families or group gathering who love meats indulges. Maybe due to lack of manpower hence it took a longer time than usual to serve us. Tend to forget what request we wants but overall this does not affect the feel and encounter we had. We will still recommend this place if any even we having in the near future. Maybe a more accessible venue would be great too.
4
Love this superhero themed cafe. If you are a meat lover, you will definitely love this place. And the fries is nice too!
5
Hungry heroes is tuck along the quiet road if Tessensohn Road. Quite challenging to find, but once you locate it, it's like finding a hidden treasure. I couldn't say more about this restaurant. Good food, excellent decors. Love it!
4
The "Nice to Meat You" platter was pretty decent sized and tasted pretty good. Environment is good and my bro is a superheroes fan which is the main reason we went.
4
Its 5 minutes walk from Ferrer Park MRT. Ambience and food was great if you are a fan of Marvel super heroes.
5
It was a good experience. Easy to use website, Staffs were friendly and food are good. Will recommend others or come again.
5
Great for couple and family. Good music, tasty burgers and value for money too. Ordered Spider Pig Burger and was delicious. Fast service with a smile and the air conditioner just perfect very cosy. I'll come back for sure.
4
Looking for a bar type place for our last night in Singapore we chose Hungry Heroes. Good choice!Easy access by bus or MRT from Orchard but not a tourist place. Burgers, ribs, fish, chicken and pasta are all featured. Happy Hour Heineken for $10 and a choice of 4 or 5 ciders..Our table for 2 was directly under the a/c vent, but they moved us to a table for 4 without question.Friendly service, good food at reasonable prices - what more you ask for
4
Not too bad. Should provide stronger chairs for big sized heros. Overall enjoyed the atmosphere n meal. ;
5
Hungry Heroes is a rare find in the present F&B scene. The restaurant is meticulously designed, leaving no blank walls and tons of easter eggs surprises. Eg. Looking up above you and you find guns painted in pink contouring the wall, subtle yet power way of communicating "make love not war". Keeping your eyes still focused above, you will find a chandelier cleverly decorated with small superhero figurines. - It's little details like this, combined with live size superhero figurines, to blending the texture of wood, metal and essential restaurant equipment that really impresses me. The creators used a theme that many may dismissed as a childish or even corny and made everything worked!The same attention to details, subtlety, blending of seemingly impossible ingredients is also reflected in the food. My favourite side; "The Clash of the Potato, Mayo & Scallions" exemplifies this. Goodness, the name of this dish sounds like a total oddball. But when you place a chunk of this awkward sounding salad in your mouth, a little nuclear bomb of flavours explodes in your mouth.Ribs, burgers, meats, pastas, dipping sauces, anything that's on the menu seems to have been designed to set off some kind of C4 loaded with flavours! Oh did I mention their 1-litre Rambo Rootbeer Float? Gear up and get ready for a food war here!Oh, and it won't cost you a bomb
5
Family enjoyed the experience, great deco, good food with generous portion. The service staff are prompt and deliver quality service. Prices of food relatively attractive. The restaurant is very well maintained and kids really like the venue. Strongly recommend.
4
beef cheeks were super tender, and the sauce for my mashed potatoes were perfect combination. fries were nicely seasoned too.
5
Great for couple and friends. It's best if restaurant to go if you like superheroes. Good value and nice food.
5
Brought kids for dinner and the place is very interesting with lots of Superhero statues, poster and interesting washroom. Meat is true to reviews, soft and tender.
4
Was here to celebrate my birthday as my wife knew I love Heroes Theme restaurant. Ground floor level was rather small but food wise was quite OK. You will be having your dinner with lots and lots of heroes figurines, some with giant sizes. We ordered a Nice to Meat you, beef was nicely done, chicken, pulled pork and ribs were so-so. But, the sauces, coriander honey and cajun mayo were extremely nice especially the coriander honey. Best sauce ever I tried and it goes darn well with the beef. Be sure you ordered this sauce
3
The superhero theme was really stunning.Ordered "the steak out" for my family of four. Food was delicious however we had to wait quite a while for it. My parents also found the place to be rather warm.Be sure to make a reservation to ensure a place
3
Limited choice on the menu. No soup and limited seafood to order. Serving on platter was sufficient. Service was good!
4
Read much about this place and brought my son for his birthday treat. Which boy doesn't like superhero? Reach after 2pm and was surprise the place still running a full house. The front table for 10 had to wait while the staff found me my table for 3. Food wise, good. The only drawback was the sirloin ordered done in Med-Rare, somehow came out Well Done. Still, because they were running a full house, took everything in. After all, took them 35 minutes to get my meal. My son's Cheeseburger done to perfection though much later than the first dish out. But it is ok as we had a platter to share. Price wise, not that heavy as there are other places charging more for the same food
4
This place offers decent food and nice beer, thus a really good hangout place I ordered a Nice to meat you (serving 2 to 3 pax)which was really awesome and their seafood aglio olio wasnt too bad either. They had quite a variety of beer, too bad the white ale wasnt available though:( Overall a really worth going cafe with nice decoration
3
Marvel heroes fan would definitely love this place. Was disappointed as they ran out of heroes fries and it was quite early in the day 6.15pm. Substituted our order with the truffle mash which was disappointing as well as it was really very dry and felt like instant mash potatoes with a drop of truffle oil. :( Other food wise we ordered the pork chop, had expected lean pork but it was the fatty part, but I suppose those who like that part of the pork will enjoy it. Best dish that we had that day were the ribs which were tender and flavourful.
5
Just a few minutes walk from Farrer Park MRT station, this is a place that looks like it should be in the middle of Sentosa Island. Some may be drawn here purely for the Superhero theme but this place is much more than just that! Every inch of the restaurant is tastefully decorated to suit the superhero theme from life size figurines to posters and action figures on the wall. The service is extremely friendly and quick, and the servers kind of fly around the restaurant like superheroes themselves. Just when you think you cannot get enough of the decor, your food comes out and the focus shifts entirely to that. We had ribs (2 for 1 special Tues - Thurs) and a pulled pork burger. Each was generous in size, ozzing with flavor and came with a side salad and fries. Even though our bellies were full, we didn`t dare leave a drop on the plate as it was just to good. For this type of restaurant, that combines a unique atmosphere and amazing food, the meals are very well priced! I would say this is a must see place on any trip to Singapore to bring out your inner superhero
4
Hearty portions and great for carnivores like us! 2 Caesar salads tangy with real bacon chunks, Hero Fries and the Nice to Meat You Platter was plenty and we even had to take away some.
We'll be back to try the amazing looking burgers!
5
The staffs there were friendly and the service was wonderful! The price for the food and drinks are reasonable. I would definitely drop by again.
4
Food and atmosphere were awesome... love tbe deco of the place.. extremelh ideal for superheroes fans..
5
First theme cafe in Singapore I felt wonderful and fantastic. Food delicious and comfortable environment!
5
Angus beef cheeks and pork ribs were melt in the mouth delicious. The cheeseburger and double breasted chicken suit were good too. We loved the decor with the super hero action figures and posters.
5
Food is great, service is excellent, ambient is cosy and warm.. Will definitely visit again and recommend my friends to patronise.
4
Food was alright. Ordered a medium rare steak and a spider burger. My bf commented that the steak was tasteless and we both find the food was a 6/10 lind of food.
5
At first i Didnt really like the location the restaurant is located. and when i arrived, it look jus like a small shop house. But my impression changed when i enter it! Its a two storey restaurant that is quite spacious! The dim lights and the interior designs made the whole place really comfortable and interesting. The super heros in the house was huge and impressive. recommended to all!
4
Their service level is worth to comment on. I ordered a pan seared Norwegian salmon, but it took longer than usual. While waiting, I asked if I could have more beef toppings for my fries, but was informed that it was chargeable. To apologise for a long wait, the service staff came back with the beef toppings that was on the house. They took note of our requests, and it took me by surprise
4
This is my second visit to this restaurant, and even though it's been almost a year, the food is as good as i remember it. The crowd was somewhat smaller though (or was it lunch vs dinner?), and i hope the place hasn't fallen on hard times. A must-visit for comic book fans and lovers of interior-design-inspiration cafes. Even if you run out of conversation topics, just admiring the memorabilia and pop art (a lot of which are for sale) can take up much of your attention. Food wise, the pulled pork is the best item on their signature sharing platters, although everything is more than decent. In terms of portion size though, this time i ordered a half-slab ribs main course, and it was kind of smallish, even smaller than the beef & chicken burgers that my friends ordered. Hungry Heroes if you're reading this, please increase the portion size
4
The Stea platter for 4 pax is extremely yummy! Places are not too crowded and we can dine in peacefully atmosphere!
5
We had a great dinner date!
Cosy atmosphere, nice superheroes deco, friendly staffs n yummy food.
Sure will patronize again soon. üòÜ
Must make appointment to secure seats.
4
The food is quite good. Serving size was just right for the 2 of us plus our 2 kids for the sharing platter for 2-3 pax.
5
Are you a fan of comic characters? Good food and nice environment that doesn't hurt your pocket? If your answer is YES!! Then you're at the right place! The portions are just right for sharing! And we were 4 hungry guys!! I gotta say tho... What made the experience even better was the staff!! Really cool and friendly bunch!!..You definitely have to come through here at least once! Oh and ask about their weekly promos!! We had ribs, at 1 for 1 pricing!!!
5
When my son first arrived at the restaurant he announced that tomorrow was his birthday, and the waiter gave him a birthday card! We enjoyed the food. Serving size was good for the price and yummy. The bill for 6 persons was reasonable. Good, not too noisy place to have dinner with kids
4
The very cool decoration is any boy's (and girl's? ;) dream! Super special. And the food was really good! Delicate spare-ribs in few flavour directions. Kitchen very clean as well, attentive young personnel. (The only negative: men toilet needs some rethinking.) But overall a very nice lunch in special ambience and very nice music
4
We ordered the 1 for1 pork ribs promo, along with truffle mash potatoes, and brownie with ice-cream. The ribs were awesome. The meat fell right off the bones when we dug in.However, the brownie lacked the chocolatey taste, and the cake was far too dry
5
I went with 2 boys, aged 5 and 8 - both Superheroes fans. The moment they stepped into the restaurant, they were so excited about all the decorations, they could not stopped talking about this Superhero and that Superhero. One was diary-intolerance and the staff and kitchen made special arrangements for him. They enjoyed themselves. Guess what? They want to go back again
4
A good place for super heroes lovers! Lots of figurines to see and take photos with. Food portion is a little small and pricey. But overall a pleasant experienc

If you want to wow your superhero focused kids this is the place!Got to say, I drove past this place a few times, thinking it might be a gimmicky little place that served sub standard food with some super hero wall paper...When my wife was away, I decided to have some crazy fun with the kids, and let them dress up as their favourite superhero to go out to dinner. So with Star-lord and Elsa in tow, we made our way to Hungry Heroes.Parking is a bit of a pain, but you could use the Civil Service Center car park across the street, if there is no on street parking, that's what we decided to do.When you walk in to this point, you can clearly see how much effort has been put in to making this place a real superhero caf√É¬©, there are action figures in glass cases adorning the walls, busts of all your favourite superheros above the kitchen and food preparation areas, very groovy lighting, and tables to match. When you think about the fact this is a Singapore shop house that has been converted to do this, its pretty impressive.Well on to the food, which was great, my son had a steak which he told me was great, my daughter had the chicken tenders which she consumed readily, and for myself I had a half rack of ribs, which had a great spicy and sour flavor to them. The really great dish here though, was a side dish... the Mac and Cheese. This is a simple, unpretentious execution of a classic, no truffles or any fancy crap, just good old fashioned Mac and Cheese, and done very well at that.The biggest heroes in this place really were the staff, totally attentive, and incredibly friendly. Even in the face of incredible danger... I mean even when really busy with a full restaurant, they took it all in their stride as if leaping a tall building in a single bound. Hats off to them, especially Jerome, who was almost Psychic in his ability to be there when we needed something.Long story short, I love this place, great experience, I just don't want to recommend it to you, because I don't want to have to fight with you for a reservation, but if we do have to fight... bear in mind I have two little superheros backing me up :-).Get in there and enjoy

The environment was welcoming and staff were nice and friendly. Great food, great decor, simply a nice place for eating and chatting with family and friends in a Super Heroes themed restaurant.

Unique and fun themed cafe with delicious food and great service. Will definitely visit again. 5 stars!

super awesome restaurant with the superheroes themed interiors
excellent service,great ambience and good food!

Had a wonderful time bringing the family to Hungry Heros. We ordered the Meat for 2 platter. Good variety of meats to cater to everyone's taste buds and it was super yummy. Will definitely visit again.
4
The meat fury ribs were really delicious- the meat literally falls off the bone! Awesome design too.
5
second time here. service is excellent, as per our first visit here. great theme for a restaurant. will be perfect if the food is consistent. ordered a meat platter both times, but the chicken, beef and coriander sauce was disappointing the second round. great experience overall
4
The food ordered especially the Karate Chop Pork is delicious...... Conducive environment for family gathering!!
4
Restaurant superb decoration...serving portion generous. Ribs is a must try! Will return to try other dishes! However, they need to improve further on their fried chicken wings...was kinda disappointing.

Was at hungry Heroes for a birthday lunch. Food was good. We ordered a 4-5pax platter to share, along with some other dishes. Ambience is wonderful and service is Tip Top. A great place to eat and chat and esp good if you're a marvel comic fan. Will be back again!
4
Very quiet location, very friendly staff, excellent food and service. Great place for hangouts with your family or for dinner together with your special one.
4
I wanted to check out the comic decorum, but was quite pleasantly surprised by everything else. The food was way above our expectations and the service was excellent!
4
Food menu is simple. Would recommend to introduce kids menu set.
Eg. Pasta with fries and drink
Mini burger with fries and drink
Nuggets with fries and drink
4
It was a very good atmosphere I must admit, if you're an avid fan of super heroes you can't miss this place! One thing that I feel needs improvement is the food, most of us ordered steak (medium rare) and it came in super rare. So yup, overall I still recommend this place!
4
Felt like I was underdressed for the place (should have worn a cape)! The place was overflowing with superheroism, from the hanging chandelier to the serum vials holding our cocktails (the Vial of Invincibility btw, was very delicious). The food was packed full of meat (we had the chicken chop & Spider Pig Burger) and the portions were more than enough. Saw a few groups having birthday celebrations there, which was convenient with the big table on the 2nd floor.Overall, very impressed with the theme of the restaurant, especially the life-size superhero models!Only downside was the lack of parking outside, had to park at the next road & walked over. But for those coming by public transport, it's actually close to the mrt

The restaurant is like a museum for fans of superheroes. There are many display items and posters that are so Instagram-worthy. Do check out the toilet which looks like a glamourised dressing room.There are two storeys so make sure you check out both floors. To me, the upper floor seems to cater to families as there are more bigger tables. The lower floor has more tables for two. There is also an alfresco dining area and despite the warm night, the area is made pretty windy with the help of the ceiling fans. I ordered Chicken Breast with Heroes sauce. It comes with a choice of fries or roasted potatoes. I chose roasted potatoes and they were served in a silver bowl. Pretty generous of them to give me around 10 potatoes! Very filling. The coleslaw and corn are nice too. I really love the main dish has I love fat-free chicken. I had a bottle of serum called Stewarts' Ice Cream Soda. It tastes nice. Given the large bottle, it is worth paying $6 for. It is not the usual glass you will get but a glass jug. The food is delicious and I would love to come back to try the other dishes

We went on a friday night. Had booked a reservation for 2 at 8pm. We imagined the place to be bustling with customers as they told us it would be full. Place was empty aside from 2 other couples.Decor was fantastic with all the superhero themed decorations and posters and toys. Staff were all young teenagers who were probably poly or post O level students. Menu was pretty much a very meat-influenced one.Our real experience started from here. After we made our choices we caught the attention of a young waitress. I ordered first and as soon as my husband was about to place his order, the girl interrupted and asked me what was my order again. I repeated this to her and after we had both ordered including the drinks, she asked me what was the orders again. She was obviously new and had no f&b ettiquette.The meals came with sides of fries and corn for the ribs and on the other page for the steak the sides were fries and roasted potatoes/corn. As my husband doesn't eat corn, he asked the waitress if he could change it to something else instead. The waitress kept going back and forth to the counter in full view and earshot of us saying that we could not do that as it was already in the system. One guy who appeared to be the manager kept telling the girl to go to us to deny us of our simple request. My husband kept looking to the manager to explain to us himself but the manager would make eye contact and then turn away. All this time we were being held up for at least 10 minutes just for this simple request to be confirmed. After seeing the waitress not being able to communicate to us, the manager himself walked over with the most unfriendliest of looks and told us that if we didn't want the corn he could give us more coleslaw. Coleslaw?? It was not even in the option. Not wanting to stall our dinner any further, my husband gave in and agreed to the manager's proposal. Without saying a word, the manager grabbed the menus and walked off giving us an extremenly unpleasant look. Was it really that hard to change a side? In most restuarants they willingly oblige to this without any complications or charge any additional amount to change. It puzzled me why it was such an issue for them.My food arrived not too long and a young waiter who seemed more interested in his handphone than serving us asked me if I needed any sauce for my fries after he served my food. When he came back with my husband's food he just walked off not asking the same for my husband. He had to call him back to ask for it and the guy gave a very begrudging look as he went to get it. The overall vibe we received from the staff was very cold and unprofessional. Some of them would gather behind the staff counter and take out their phones to use and chat oblivious to the fact that their patrons were eating around them.For the food, we ordered the spider pig burger and the signature ribs. Taste wise it was just average and portions were small. It was surely not value for money at all with the prices that they charged.√Ç¬† Also do not go for the coleslaw. It had a funky taste and after a bite each we did not eat anymore of it. Our expectations were definitely not met, food wise.Last but not least there was not any thank you greeting or anything when we left. The staff just gave us a blank look and stood still watching us leave. All in all this was a very bad experience for us and we will surely not be returning. The decor and theme was an A+ but service was utterly horrible, cold and unfriendly and staff were unprofessional and incompetent. Absolutely not value for money at all for the quality and quantity of the food. For a local restaurant/cafe I am truly disappointed as we have come across so many good ones to say the least. I would only recommend to anyone who wants to take nice photos of the restaurant but not to actually dine in it

Very nice. The food menu could include more kids' items. Maybe, can include some superheros figurines sale. Will definitely visit again.

The others customer kids was running about and making noises. Both the kids parent and the crew there is not stopping.

Celebrated my father's birthday at Hungry Heroes on 31 October 2015 over dinner knowing that my dad loves graphic novels and has a deep interest in superheroes, especially Batman.Well, he got a surprise when he managed to get a photo opportunity with someone dressed up as Batman and Joker while we were there. I think that made his day.We ordered the Steak-Out which was able to feed 5 adults, lots of side dishes, especially the Zucchini and Eggplant and topped it up with the chocolate brownie. For my wife who is breastfeeding, we added the Pacific Dory for her.For drinks, my dad has the house ale at Happy Hour price and I had the Nordic Berries Cider. It is a pity that there was no more Mac and Cheese by the time we ordered. I suppose it is a hugely popular side dish so perhaps, more could be prepared.We give a thumbs-up to the quality and portion of the food! The spare ribs were tender enough to come off the bone. The medium-done beef steak was grilled perfectly. All in all, it is a good place for birthday celebrations, especially if the birthday boy/girl is like my father, a super-hero fan. He was particularly intrigued by the decor of the place and took special note of the Minion Avengers beneath the life-size Batman and Superman statues and the Hungry Heroes "Last Supper" mural on the wall of the second storey. Thank you Hungry Heroes for making my dad's day on his 61st birthday

Went there for hubby's birthday, it was our 1st visit to the place and we were all very pleased with our selection. my 3yr old son had a great time too looking at the superhero figures surrounding us! will definitely visit again!
4
Very nice atmosphere for Marvel, DC, Pop arts fans.
Food portion was reasonably large.
Staffs are on the ball. Very efficient. Maybe when visited wasn't during peak hours.
Overall a nice restaurant in a quaint corner of Singapore.

You've heard of truffle fries, it tastes great; but have you heard of truffle mashed potatoes? It's mind blowing! The cafe serves grilled food and offers platter choices. They have a bar as well! On top of the gastronomical satisfaction, they can satisfy your inner-child respect for the super heroes. The super heroes are almost as real as if they were dining with you
4
worth to go back again. Very well designed restaurant and their menu is very interesting. Servers are very helpful and service are very prompt. I will bring friends there again and definitely value of money 
5
It's rare to find a place that is well decorated AND serves great food but this one nails it in both areas. I had the fillet steak with their special Heroes Sauce and it was the bomb! The spam fries are great too and the service rocks. And of course, the restaurant itself makes for fantastic Instagram photos. Can't wait to come back again
3
Bad ventilation. Kinda warm. Maybe 2nd floor will be better.Theme of the restaurant is the reason why we are there.Portion of food is generous but the taste is nothing spectacular, expect to be much better
4
Good service! Food serving is reasonable and tasty! My nephews and my son love the place and food. Parking can be a little challenging if after 7pm. Reservation before you go on Fri and weekends, especially if you're with a big group.

Upon entering the museum-like cafe, we were awed by the life sized superhero figurines. (There were exactly 6). But however, after sitting down I requested for my table to be changed (because we wanted to sit beside the life sized figures upstairs where it seemed more cozy) and the waitress told me she would have to check if it is possible. I waited 10 minutes while she discussed with an unfriendly looking guy with the face of a guard-dog. (He was not even in uniform) Only to be told that I had to remain at my table, despite the cafe was 20 - 30% occupied. 6 staff were standing around at the bar and even after 15 minutes nobody came to take my order or serve us cold water. I do hope your manager could improve his interpersonal skills. - Ryan & friends, patrons on 3rd October 2015

Nice and cosy place, perfect for group gatherings; menu has lots of items good for sharing, meat lovers will love this place! Nice decoration around the cafe. The first level feels more intimate; ideal for couples and the second level best for big groups! Great service staffs too, just a 5 mins walk from Farrer park mrt
5
Service - Very polite & helpful.Food - Simply delicious. We had the Nice to Meat You. Meat portion was good for 2. Side dishes was abit too much. No complains.Environment - Surprisingly there wasn't a Sunday Lunch Crowd. Probably because it was the Formula One opening. Decorations was stunning, very colorful and unique. Price - Value for Money, in my opinion.Highly recommended.
4
The moment I stepped into the restaurant, it literally gave me the "wow' feeling. It have 2 storeys, classy and pop. Super Heroes lover will confirm love it!!! The food was quite nice too.
Service was pleasant too. Overall, awesome!
5
5 minutes walk from farrer park purple line, very convenient. Recommended for those who are fans of Marvel, extensive display of the superheroes around the restaurant.
Service was fast and the staff there were super friendly as well :)
5
Great for friends gathering, kids party celebration & loves ones who will appeciate the heroic atmosphere here! Highly recommended the pork ribs!!!
5
Service was great, the food was very very filling, delicious. Very beautiful decoration. Ideal for dates and gatherings :) Slightly pricey though. But still pretty worth it :)
3
Attentive and polite staff. We were seated on 2nd level. Amazed by the heroes decor especially the lamps. Some ornaments/art pieces on display are for sale too. Food is just average. If you like superhero, can just visit for the experience
4
When first stepped into the restaurant, you feel very amazed and there are so many things to look at
3
Food was good but experience was spoilt by a group of young kids running amok past our table throughout our dinner and they were screaming at the top of their lungs. We requested for a table downstairs but staff said they are fully booked. And the staff hesitated to tell the parents that their kids' behaviours are affecting diners. I know it is a family restaurant but it doesn't mean that kids' bad behaviours can be tolerated. 
2
The ambiance is good and food is nice. However, the service needs to be improved. First time i came across staff asking customer to get ready to leave by 8pm. I came abit late for my reservation and got to have a very rush dinner that day. abit disappointing
3
Price, food & service all within expectation. Life size figures placed either too far away or too high above to take picture with.
5
Great food and love the ambience...it was better than I expected. My eldest son was rather impressed with the place. I am glad I made the right choice to celebrate his 20th birthday
4
This is one restaurant I spent admiring the many super heroes hung on the walls & ceiling. We had huge Superman, Batman, Captain America, Iron & Thor dining with us! The BBQ ribs & bake Zucchini/Eggplant were delicious.
4
This restaurant serves great grill and the serving is pretty big enough for a small group for three (for the "Nice to meat you" platter) ... And if you are an Avenger fan.. You gotta check up their deco.. I'm sure you will love it.
3
Really adore the amazing decorated interiors and concept behind this restaurant, but there was a lack of service staff clearing insightful leftover plates from the previous customers. Food was decent but nothing fantastic.
4
Pretty amazed by the amount of superheros figurine & painting displayed in the restaurant. Everywhere are superheros! Food is nice too. Had a nice to meat platter and it is just nice for 2 persons. As we went during on a thur, there isn't much ppl, therefore we really can have a good look around. Better to make a reservation to avoid disappointment.Will visit again

Good thing: the decor is nice and unique. Credits to that.Now, the negative experience. We weren't aware that there is a slot-based system, in the which we must vacate our table (it's my fault for not finish reading the T&C of the booking). The waiter only came and inform us 5 mins before 7:45pm, and before that he even took our drink orders. What's the point? Was he expecting us to finish our drink in 5 mins? And his attitude wasn't friendly at all. He gave this vibe that he can't wait for us to leave, and kept clearing our plates whilst some of us were hurrying to finish the food. Let's move on to food. We ordered the platter for 7/8people. It was very mediocre and food wasn't hot when it's already served, especially the fish. It seems like the food was already cooked and merely being reheated prior to serving us. When we asked whether it is possible for the kitchen to help us to cut the big meats, the answer is "no, kitchen is very busy". Overall I wouldn't recommend this place. For the price you pay, the food is utterly mediocre and nothing fancy.
3
Must-visit for Superhero fans! Amazing decor and collectibles. Every inch of the restaurant is insta-worthy. Food was slightly above average but my steak was overcooked. I had the Ribeye with roasted potatoes and the sides were done really nicely! The orange cream soda was really good too. They had a few interesting ciders too.The restaurant is good for groups and families as they have quite a few items on the menu for sharing. Do make an online reservation (tip: do ask for level 2 seats!) before heading down, especially on fridays and weekends as the place tends to fill up quickly. I would still go back to try the platters (;
4
Hungry Heroes is a small restaurant with a nice theme. Those who love superheroes should pay a visit, but my advice is to make a reservation first before visiting. There are customers who walk in are unable to dine there due to full reservations. Food is good as well.. so overall, well done.
4
Ambience was fabulous. Restaurant was tastefully furnished. Service was prompt and good. Food was good especially the beef burger. Prefer the luncheon meat fries to be more thinner and crispy
2
The only thing that's good is the decor. The price is high, parking was not easy. I was there with my children (young ones) ten mins before their opening time and they didn't let us in early even though it was drizzling. My 2 children (3 and 4 year old) were left sitting in their sheltered porch. They didnt even wipe the outdoor furnitures dry.They dont serve mac and cheese before 4pm (the only food really suitable for children 3 years and below) and they ran out of mash potatoes (we were the first customers on a weekend!).Its rather disappointing. The staff were quite blur and didn't let us sit at the 2nd level because they said ` there were not enough staff!' I wanted to sit at the 2nd level coz 1st level was too cramped and no space for my children to roam around
3
decoration at some parts somewhat cluttered and mismatched, however the full-sized figurines are awesomeservice was prompt and server went out of the way to ensure we get nice photosbeef was slightly too tough despite already asking for medium and serving too huge (although price wasn't cheap either
5
Atmosphere is good.
Food is nice.
Staff are approachable and customer service are good.
*thumb up* for the place.
remember to make your reservation before going. =)
3
the place is uniquely cool!!!
first floor and second floor different theme. the food also good too..
4
Walking distance from Farrer Park MRT. Great place for friends' gathering. Wide variety of food. Yummy! And they give us free dessert (but only one per receipt). Overall experience: Excellent
1
The interior decor is great especial for Marvel fans as there were statues and display items themed around superheroes. I was greatly fascinated by them. By the time the food arrived, all this wide-eye experienced ceased. While my Astro Miso ribs were fine, my partner who ordered a fillet to be medium rare had his cut served quite blue. As the fillet came in 2 pieces, we explained that one was done perfectly well, but the other needed a bit more grilling as it was really bloody. It got sent to the kitchen and turns out that they re-grilled BOTH pieces of fillet and did not return with the original sides. We ended up with an overdone piece and a somewhat medium-rare piece. Nevermind that the flavoring of the steak was not great, the texture of the steak turned out to be less than ideal. Now the air-conditioning of the place is not great either especially during the day so I was quite eager to leave. For some reason, the bill took really long to come back to us. We decided to shorten the process by going to the cash register instead of waiting around. Service staff at the register looked quite unapproachable and gave really curt responses while sending us off to a next door cafeteria to claim our free dessert (not worth it either). I had high hopes for this one. With the efforts spent on their interior decor and a menu well-curated for meat lovers, Hungry Heroes would definitely draw in a larger crowd if they can just get their act together. The service staff needs to better listen to what customers are requesting for.

If there is one place to live your SuperHeroes fantasy and impress on a date night or a casual dinner, you have come to the right place. Newly opened opposite CSC Tessensohn Road, you will see a row of traditional shophouses. Once inside the restaurant, you will be greeted quirky decor of Arts Arts Arts and various live-size SuperHeroes. Meat and Beers are their main attractions. I love their presentation of food and food is definitely pleasing. There is a large table up the 2nd level where you got host a group dinner as well. I will surely be back for more
3
Great novelty but the food was pretty below average. The filet steak had a burnt taste even though the doneness was done right. I couldn't make out the cut of the steak as most parts are either dried or filled with tendons. The Pacific dory was tasteless on its own. All food including sides were served cold. The bright side was that the fries, coleslaw and corn were pretty tasty. Otherwise it would be a rocking cool restaurant
1
The food was so-so and the portion is little. Was a Mother's Day celebration for my mum, it turns out her chicken was uncooked. Took long time to serve her another one. The ambience is nice, a little squeezy though. Will probably not come for the food again, maybe just beer session with friends
4
It was all good until my set meal came. I ordered a pacific dory with fries as my side dish but I was served baked potatoes instead. The manager told me it's ok to go ahead and eat first as he will get me another side dish of fries. I was happy that he was very accommodating and this really pleased me as it was my exact birthday, I didn't want anything to spoil my mood. It was an overall thumbs up experience
5
Went with my 3 kids aged 9,6 and 5. All of them are fascinated by the decor of the restaurant ! Everyone was so happy and don't feel bored at all .Food wise , we order "nice to meet you" platter, stew beef and mini salad . Portion is just nice for the 5 of us ... My little disappointment was the steak was a bit overdone ... I ordered medium well but it turn out to be very well done ... I will order medium next time Nonetheless , it's a awesome dining experience for us 
2
This is the main problem with most thematic restaurants - they hope that the visual display (in this case it's a gaudy and tacky assault on the senses) would make you overlook the main purpose of your visit - having a good dinner. The food was awful. We ordered the platter for two with the house sauce. The chicken was tasteless, the pork scratching was close to disgusting, the steak overdone and rubbery, the mini caesar salad had an off-putting smell. The so called house sauce was thin and boring. Even the ice lemon tea was awful.Take pictures, lots of them while you are there because you definitely don't want to waste your time and money visiting again.
5
It's a very nice cafe. Good food, good ambience, friendly staff. A perfect place for superheroes fans to eat. Love it! üòç.

Thumbs up for the friendly & accomodating staff, delicious food, & the interesting figurines & statues.

Restaurant decorated with super heroes theme, great ambience , foods was good but not superb. Worth to have a try :)

We visited this restaurant because it is located near our residential area.It's newly opened hence we gave it a try since we see some positive reviews on Tripadvisor.The restaurant is cool. They displayed many toys in the restaurant. Service is good and attentive.We ordered the platter for two. The quality of the ingredients eg sirloin beef are so-so only. The craft beer is okay but I think it is expensive. Overall, we paid for the ambience.We were invited to their desert house next door for complimentary desert. The concept is good. They are selling some art piece and paintings in the desert house. Overall, it's a good place for gathering.
4
The location was not too far from the MRT so it's okay. I liked the fact that it was really a comic/superhero fan's dream come true in terms of decor. I loved the figurines and the decor in general. Really good planning of the space.The food was not bad. It's themed around superheroes, and definitely male-focused with all the red meat. The Ribs are good, but the hughlight is actually the way they did the chicken chop. It was charred nicely, and really juicy. Steak was okay, so if you're a Steak type of person, you might want to skip that because you'll compare and it'll come up short
5
Captain America, Batman, Spiderman, Ironman, Marilyn Monroe, Philip King, Beatles and many others will surround you while you having their signature pork rib..Can't imagine that? check this out by yourself!! I'm sure it is different from other restaurant. =)Tips: Better make a reservation before you go coz it is always full house! >
4
If you love superheroes, pop culture and great food, this is the place to be. My date and I ordered the "Nice to Meat you meal" and the steak and pulled pork were great. We went there for lunch and were so full that we skipped dinner. Only problem I see is that the place may be understaffed (although, the staff did try their best to serve us). Would definitely go back here again.
3
Was there for dinner with my family on a Friday nite. We booked online and confirmation was prompt. It was meant as a surprise for my boy bade as he's into Avengers Heros, thus we decided to go for the Hungry Heros restaurant after reading several reviews on the Avengers collectibles there..ambience and decor of the restaurant don't dissappoint.. With a cosy feel and food was served fast. We ordered a platter that serves 2-3 pax ( comes with steak, chix, ribs n pull pork plus two free sides ) n a additional sausage trio for two of my boys. Steak was bland n tasteless, chix steak was so so , ribs and the pull pork ( was marinate nicely )deserve some credits though. On the whole, come here if you are a meat lover and into marvel Heros collectibles.. Otherwise, you can find similar or even better grill meats out there..
4
D√©cor of the place is nice and I think it is really cool. Background music is not too loud and are pop music. The service staffs are all very nice and had asked us to take a look at the 2nd level since it is a different feel as compared at level 1. When ordering, also checking with us if we have specific cards as there's a promo. I think it is a really good initiative as some other restaurants don't even bother to let their customers know that there are special promos.Food wise, we ordered the platter which is for 2 - 3 pax servings. Chicken was pretty bland but it was still tender. Maybe the chefs can work on it more. As for the Ribs, pulled pork and beef, they were great. Really tasty and delicious. Sides are always nice (Luncheon Chips - A must order side). Waiting time for the food was around 15 minutes and consider fast for me.Overall a great experience for a first time. The price is still reasonable. Will be back next time

Hungry Heroes is a small eatery nestled in a quiet area near Farer Park MRT station, along Tessensohn Road. The main draw of this restaurant is the comic/movie d√©cor; think of a Hard Rock Caf√© albeit on a smaller scale and swap Aerosmith for Ironman. Despite the name and the funky online marketing, the prevalence of comic paraphernalia is rather restrained ‚Äì with only one wall containing super hero busts and models (on the ground floor at least). The rest contains posters and mock up guns. I personally wasn‚Äôt so overawed by their decor. Overall however, the ambience of the place is relaxed, calm and is helped by the attentive and friendly staff.We ordered the ‚ÄúJustice Is Served‚Äù platter. According to the menu, this serves 8-9 people, however, the 4 of us had no trouble in finishing off the platter; which comes in at $198++. At that price I can't say it's worth it, considering you can get more for your money elsewhere. Taste wise, the food was a mishmash as well; the steaks were quite bland though the ribs were flavoured nicely. However, their half gallon of craft beer was a highlight. Light and aromatic, it was a delight to the taste buds and complimented the platter very well.Despite the nice d√©cor, the food is average and no different from any other restaurant serving similar food. Unfortunately the food wasn't spectacular and the decor wasn't anything to rant or rave about. In the end, a nice, independent restaurant which serves average food and nothing more, unfortunately
