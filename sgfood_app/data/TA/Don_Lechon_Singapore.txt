We visit Don Lechon regularly for a lechon fix. It's Manila-style lechon belly, and done very well. Staff are really friendly as well. Nice little spot with outdoor seating by the river if you want to eat there and they also do takeaway.

If you're crazy over lechon, take note of Don Lechon located by Geylang River. I had a very nice experience on my first try. I ordered 2 meals for take out - the chopped lechon and lechon sisig. The lechon skin was still very crispy despite getting moist due to the heat inside the container, while the lechon meat was tender and tasty. Actually, there was no need for sauce as the lechon was prepared ala Cebu lechon. Nonetheless, they give you both liver sauce and soy sauce-based mixture. As for the sisig, the texture and taste left a positive impression for my first Don Lechon experience. Plenty of pork meat and egg made the dish truly enjoyable. You'll definitely want to come back

I have always felt that there aren't that many Pinoy restaurants/food stops here in Singapore, and a great one is even more of a rarity. So when Don Lechon opened and it's just in our neighbourhood, I knew I had to try it - one way or the other. Hubby and I dropped by one lunch time (on a weekend, I think) and the place wasn't teeming with people - which I thought was really a pity because their lechons are pretty good. It brought back a lot of pleasant memories from when I was still living in Manila. I ordered lechon paksiw and it was delicious! My husband tried sisig and he thought it was just as good as the ones he tried back when he used to visit me in Manila. They have the original lechon and also lechon sinigang which I have yet to try. The place itself is quite simple. They have tents with tables and chairs inside. I hope that they will consider serving other Pinoy dishes and maybe desserts, too. Then i would be more inclined to come back a few times.:

First time trying out lechon and it's super awesome!..it something like Babi guling (in Bali), but even better ..more flavorful and thick cuts, but tender and juicy at the same time. Their homemade soy sauce just go along well with the pork too...love it!..they also serving pata, which is a sort of pork knuckles..Great tender pork with crispy skin too..the only missing thing here is the beer really..:) owner was very friendly and welcoming..such a pleasure to dine here..sure will come back again...after lots and lots of exercises...:
