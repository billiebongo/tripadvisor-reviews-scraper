Excellent service staff. Tried their lunch set menu and it doesn't disappoint me. Nice presentation and good food for the money you pay. Their fruit tea is a must to order! V refreshing. I will come back again.

Surprised to find such a sophisticated restaurant tucked away on the the 4th floor of a shopping centre. They serve quality fusion food of high standard making it well worth the visit. Dishes are well presented ranging from grass-fed beef, sizzling on a hot rock, to a delicious soft-shell crab. We sat over looking the river in a private room which added to the experience. We were quite excited about the 2005 De Lafitte Lujac red wine which is apparently about to run out but due to be replaced with something just as good. Now would be a good time to head down there and snap up a bottle before it's too late! Although don't drink too much as it's a long way to the bathroom.....The service was always with a smile which rounded off the whole experience and we'll definitely be going back
