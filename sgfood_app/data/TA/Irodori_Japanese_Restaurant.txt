service is quite good. the food served is fresh and waiting time is ok. only that tables are quite close to each other so a bit noisy for each other to be heard. weekends are crowded so make a booking is necessary

We went to this all you can eat restaurant located In the hotel. It was delicious!!!
High quality fish, a big selection and a really quick service.
Best of all was the price. $38 plus tax for dinner!
4
All you can eat a la carte buffet. Sushi and Sashimi is fresh. Independent establishment so not part of the hotel so you can't sign to the room.
Able to cater for private functions.

Value for $, mass market buffet. Free tea. Decent variety. Thick slices of sashimi. Temaki rice is not vinegared sushi rice though, and lots of rice. Quick service though a few orders were missed, fairly friendly. A little noisy and cramped.

Fresh sashimi!!! Such a lovely experience. I do not have a btter explanation for the food, From the pics i took, thats how good my experince was. Surely would love to have the second experience
2
The food was bland and uninspired, which matched the service and atmosphere. I work in Japan a good bit, and also frequent sushi restaurants around the world, and this experience was just not good. Singapore is such a great city for food, I guess I just expected more. Low point was hamachi sashimi that appeared to be frozen in the middle!...

Food quality is alright. Less than half the tables filled, our tempura, fried shisamo and some other fried food took more than 30 mins to serve. Asked if they could check my order, all the waitress said was there are many orders and I have to queue. She didn't even check. Come on I was here before so many of the patrons and my food took so long. When the ebi tempura finally came, one of then was not hot. Really bad experience. All waitresses but one were sulking and pulling a long face. I won't recommend bringing your friends, you would feel embarrassed

Went to this Japanese restaurant to celebrate friend birthday. We have bought an ice cream cake, told the staff to put in freezer but when the cake was served it is already melted. The place is crowded and shortage of staff. The staff that served us is a bit rude and while we are still ordering our food, she told us to order in the next round. The food serving is a bit slow though but the food make up for it. Most of the food served is in big portion, would prefer it to be smaller size so that we can try on more food. Some of the food items such as BBQ joint wing, ginger beer, chicken stick etc is especially good. Fried rice is a bit dried and tasteless, lucky it came in small portion though. It is only 9pm but the staff start keeping the soy sauce n wasabi from all customer. The price for this Japanese buffet is not very expensive, the varieties are alot and you can just keep ordering. Not really recommended but can try once

Was reading lots of reviews about the buffet at this place and decided to give it a shot. Went over at 1.45 pm with my family only to be told that the buffet has ended and they have cleared the food away. The website said that it was until 2.30 pm. When we asked the person behind the counter, he said we are done with the last order. He did offer us the ala carte menu but I think we were more disappointed that they closed the buffet a good 45 minutes before time. Would be nice if they could put it up in their website at least...We left the place hungry and angry. Iâ€™m sorry Trip Advisor, but I think you put your sticker on the wrong door this time.
5
I have been here a few times to get my fix of sashimi and other dishes. The sashimi served are of thick slices, and most importantly, fresh. The soup tea is also something nice to drink. The speed of service is good. Expect the place to be crowded every time you visit, so make your reservation in advance.

Had farewell dinner for one colleague on Friday, 3 March.
Managed to occupy VIP room for 10 pax, service was not as great however still acceptable.
Food serving portions good and sashimi fresh.
Recommend to go try.
4
Great food, especially generous with fresh sashimi. Drawback was we had to track our ourselves if our order is fulfilled.
5
Omg this had to be the best tasting sushi I have ever had!! We had some sword fish, and salmon!! My god so fresh and very tasty!! Highly recommend this place!!!
4
The irodori Japanese restaurant is a nice buffet Japanese restaurant. You can order any thing in the buffet menu. All food are fresh n nice. You can eat as much as you can . It is Value for money . This restaurant is very popular and advisable to make reservation in advance. The only disappointed we have is no deserts
3
All you can eat buffet which offers a wide coffee of Japanese dishes. However the sushis and temakis are very heavy on rice. It did not use to be like this and a few months back this was a really decent place forb sushis. Hope this is a temporary mishap. Will go again to check.

My friends and I celebrated the New Years Eve at this restaurant. The a la carte buffet dinner price was SGD 48++ which was more expensive than the usual SGD 36++ but it was still a lot cheaper than most buffets available during the festive season. We were glad that we made reservations ahead because it was quite full. On every table was an appetizer of fried fish that was cold and salty but they didn't mind that we didn't eat it. They served a number of complimentary dishes for the festive period which we enjoyed, such as: baby abalone with oyster sauce (Cantonese style, which seems odd in a japanese restaurant but it was quite juicy and tender); large prawn grilled with mentaiko (spicy cod roe); grilled swordfish belly; premium sashimi moriwase with raw scallop and red shrimp; and BBQ scallop on shell. The regular menu had quite a good selection of Japanese perennial favorites including my favorite vinegar mackerel sushi, yellowtail sashimi, ebi tempura and bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms. The sashimi was quite fresh though not the top grade. The sushi rice was tasty but also not the best kind (I think Ikoi restaurant just across the road at Miramar serves better rice and fresher sashimi in their a la carte buffet). The service was not fantastic as it was a busy festive period, but they were prompt in responding to our order requests and our food came quite quickly after the second and subsequent orders.
5
The place was packed when i went but the service staff were super attentive. food was served very fast as well. Most important of all, the sashimi was very fresh and the complimentary salmon fish head as well as the prawns tasted really good but it was a pity that we only get a portion.
4
Came to celebrate my aunt birthday and always love the freshness of the sashimi! One downside is they tend to serve the mentaiko prawn cold and they shogayaki beef as well. The food is good but it is quite difficult to get the attention of the server. Great place for your japanese good craving fix but better reserved in advance
4
At $36++ per person, this ala carte buffet offers real value for money. The menu is extensive. Go for the fresh sashimi, and skip the cooked stuff, which was pretty standard fare. The tempura was ok but not crisp the way we liked it. A good place for gatherings though service could have been a little more prompt and attentive
3
Irodori is a Japanese buffet which honestly is really decent for sushi and sashimi. The cooked food is generally ok although they go give you a special plate when you first enter the restaurant. That is usually ok.The start of the show is really the sashimi and maybe the handrolls. Just go for them over and over again.Note that the service isn't the best and some of the food may take time to come if the restaurant is buzzing. Still if you crave for tons of sushi and sashimi, this is a good place to go
5
All you can eat for 37$
Wide selection of sushi and other Japanese dishes
Clean place. Open relaxed atmosphere.
Service is fluid and effective, even if place was packed.
Offer a few amuse bouches to sample new things.
Temakis are pretty good!
4
Quite good and cheap Japanese food. The place is a little cramp but good for people with huge appetites. Service was not bad.
4
Had a nice meal here the other day. Food and service was very good. Nice place to eat if you are near-by or in the hotel. A good choice.
4
Irodori is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants. It's a no fuss kid of place, most days I've walked in with having to make reservations. The service is fast and professional. The menu is pretty long and the quality is excellent.
5
At first the seating arrangement isn't nice for a couple, after we are allowed to change to counter seats, every thing could not be better, thanks for the staff explained a lot and recommend dishes with patience, also refill the tea with efficiency. The super fresh and delicious food are valuable for money!!

Itadakimasu ... let's enjoy the sashimi and sushi that is offered by this award winner of 2012/13. Its name meaning many colours so are the wonderful delicious food offered here.Sashimi of various assortment of salmon, tuna, hamachi, sword, squid and octopus are offered with NO limit and it is fresh.Handrolls and sushi of your choice are abundant. Even ebi tempura has NO limit and is crispy fresh. Grilled fresh hamachi fish head are also offered and the succulent salmon roed grilled medium prawns are a great delight. Grilled shisamu and yakitori and the hot piping chawamushi are a great variety.Fresh juicy salads and piping hot soup are complimentary.With a wonderful complement of sakae and a cold red bean sesame and green teaIce cream to end your meal.They have a private room for 10 and above. But when the restaurant is crowded the out of sight out of mind atmosphere sets in even tho we were with a regular VIP host.To avoid the long wait reservations are encouraged
5
Irodori is located at Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview. We booked a buffet a la carte dinner and were really impressed by the quality food. The food was not just delicious but it was a really good value. You pay a flat price for dinner and you can pick anything you like from the menu. I didn't count but they say there are more than 100 dishes.I supplemented sushi, tempura and other Japanese classics with hot sake. And we had an excellent evening at Riverview. Highly recommended
4
Booked a private room for 14 of us to celebrate a gf's birthday! It's my first time there. I must say the food is better than expected even though it is buffet. Some places pre-prepared the food n just heat up when diners order. But that one time when I went to Irodori, we didn't have such an experience. The menu has a huge variety of dishes to choose from. It will be good if u can go together in a group so that u get to try the dishes here n there. The service is very prompt. Although we were in a private room, the staff came in regularly to clear the plates, top up our tea n also to take our orders. On a Friday night, damage is only 33 per pax. Worth it! Will I return again? Definitely!
3
Have not been to the restaurant for long time. Same ambience but the quality of the food have changed. The sashimi was too big slices and am sure it is not up to the Japanese standard. Service was average. Love the grilled prawn ( only for first serving)
5
This is a Great japanese Style Restaurant. The food is good quality. The offer of "all you can eat" is very good price value for Singapore. This place is frequented by lots of Japanese people. If you go with more than a party of two, please reserve a table.
4
Had a private room for a group of 10. The staff attended to us when we signalled to take orders. Food quality is ok for the price.
Sashimi is fresh. Food quality is decent of the price.
4
Reservation was easy. However not many seats around for booking.
Variety of Japanese food was awesome for the money.
Staff clears the table occasionally and takes order upon request.
Closing after lunch hour is flexible helps to gather colleagues longer for chitchat.

Most important thing about Sashimi and Sushi is the fish quality and the rice. There Irodori does not fail. The fish was fresh and of a high quality. Though not the best I have had still more than good enough to satisfy most sashimi lovers. The sushi rice was delicious so much so that I wanted more sushi and less sashimi which is rare for me but may also speak to the fish being fresh and clean but not really that flavorful. All of that said one must also remember that this is "buffet" style which does not mean an open buffet that you can continually pick from but a menu that you can order all you want from. For all-you-can-eat sashimi and sushi this was certainly the highest quality I have ever had. The menu is also full with other Japanese staples like Tempura, Katsu Don, Udon and Soba, etc. I tried the Ebi Ten Udon (though mostly full from the Sashimi Moriawase) and it was a smallish dish with a very good broth and a nice piece (only one) of Ebi tempura that stood up to the broth and did not fall apart though I ate it last. The noodles were unremarkable though I might not have been able to judge well after the sushi taste in my mouth. Service was okay. Not really attentive and since you have to order additional servings from them they don't exactly solicit your orders. The room is open and pretty loud and I guess not too large. I came alone on a Wednesday night but they still seemed surprised I did not have a reservation. Keep this in mind if you are a larger party. The restaurant is on the third floor of a hotel (Four Points by Sheraton) and the signage is weak at best. Looked like the Sheraton had just taken over from another hotel so with hope this gets better.The buffet with a couple of Tiger beers, an annoying and unannounced "service fee", plus tax still brought the price up to a bit over sixty Sing dollars so not as cheap as the buffet price implies but again for all-you-can-eat, high to mid quality Japanese food, in Singapore, it's a deal. If I ever have the chance to bring my family with me I'll bring my daughter here and on that night I am sure we will get the better of the food for price deal
1
My mum told, if there is nothing good to say, I will just be silent, but for this round, I need to air my frustration over my dinner in Irodori restaurant in four point by Sheraton Singapore. This is one of the worst Japanese eatery in SG. For $36++ per person is overrated, deep fried food is soggy, sashimi 3/10, sushi same category as Sakae sushi or worst. Tempura fried like Hokkien style...Hiazzzzzzzzz..If I have choice it would minus 10 to 100 and not 1 out of 5. Why the restaurant is still around!!!!
4
This is the place to go if you are into fresh sashimi and want a lot of it yet not wanting to burn a hole in your pocket.It's a buffet that is $36.80 and 15% discount for lunch with some credit cards promotion.The sashimi is very fresh and the cuts are generously thick.The donburi teapot soup is superb we have so many of it!Sushi is so so because of the rice which seems a bit hard and not sticky sweet.So just have sashimi if you are into fresh fish.Their tako balls and yakitori are not so nice but the special maki and hand roll are good.Service wise, not as slow as some comments here, they are busy yes, but usually easy to get them to serve you on your orders or changing plates.The only thing that spoil our joy a bit is that 2 senior Filipino captains.For some reason their face is so black and they don't serve you with any smile, and when the bill was incorrect when I point out, no apology no nothing just take it back and then throw to my table again to sign.The male captain, when we ask him to take order he was pretty impatient and just don't give you any eyes contact nor speak anything! That really spoil our mood a bit.Hope they can know in service line you have to hide your frustration or moody mood no matter when you are serving your customers
4
Everytime I come here I always have the dinner buffet. You basically order from a menu given to you and they will serve the food straight to your table. Sometimes it can get busy and the waitresses might take a while to take your order and the food might also take a while to arrive. I find the sashimi and sushi fresh and tasty as well as the complimentary prawns extremely satisfying
2
After reading the many rave reviews about this place, we decided to try the Pomo branch. To be very fair, I must say that the sashimi was fresh and the servers (mainly young part timers) were attentive and quick to respond to our requests.However, dinner is not worth the money. There is no further discount on the bill. The food is nothing to boast about because you can easily get the same standard at any Japanese restaurant. I was actually disappointed in many dishes that came highly recommended. I will definitely not return again. It is not worth my money to pay around S$85 for 2 persons for dinner
4
Family of 11 came and we had a private room! It was all good at first when we came in at 6.30pm as the restaurant was not packed yet and food came almost immediately, waiters were attentive.When the crowd came in at about 7+, we had difficulties ordering or getting refills for our tea as most of the waiters are busy and they don't come into our private room. Had to walk out to get one of them in.The speed of the food served was also slowed due to the crowd. We have 2 plates of free mentaiko prawns served by them and it was nice too.Their special irodori roll was also great!Sashimi was great, except for yellowtail, don't order it as it has a terrible taste that doesnt taste like its fresh.Swordfish and tako was superb, salmon too. Tuna was soso. Buffet's very worth it if you are a sashimi lover
4
My new favorite restaurant for Japanese buffet. Visited 4 times over the past year. Huge variety on the menu and I like it that generous portions of sashimi are served quickly. Staff is friendly and generally attentive. The restaurant is big and able to accommodate large groups (my last visit was with 10 adults and 6 kids). Reservation is required, usually fully booked on weekends
4
We went there for an early Mother's Day celebration. I booked in advance (4days) for 10, but 2 more family members wanted to join in the last minute. As I was given a room which could only seat max 10 persons, I called the restaurant on the actual day to change. Obviously the restaurant was then fully booked. However, the lady on the phone told me there was a group 10 seated outside. She would call to check if the customer was willing the swap with us, so it would be possible for us to add 2 more seats. Luckily, the other customer agreed to swap. We were thankful that the restaurant was helpful so our whole family could enjoy a good Mother's Day lunch together. Food was fresh and good. The only thing we found was, it was a little too salty and " tasty" for Japanese food. But it may suit a lot of Singaporean who generally like very tasty food. We went to the one in River View Hotel. The environment was good and arrangement of tables were not too cramped. Complimentary dishes they served were good too, especially the salmon belly. Yes, the whole family enjoyed the lunch !
3
1st visit to the restaurant. Food quality is good for the price. Staff seemed a little overwhelmed once the place was full. This meant attentiveness slipped considerably halfway through dinner.
1
The only thing on the menu that was decent was perhaps the salmon sashimi, everything else was mediocre to bad. Granted that it was a buffet but quality shouldn't be compromised. Never going back again.
5
Japanese buffet with many many items, fresh sashimi, cooked food, fried food, noodles and rice dishes, you name it, they have it!
Sashimi is fresh!

Offer ala cart style japanese food. Excellent food were prepare upon order. Value for money. Comes with complementary delicious fish head, very well done , taste wonderful. Will certainly go back . Good discount with major card.
2
Went POMO branch last nite,with 2 friends. I would agree with most reviewers that this restaurent is over rated. My first dish of sashimi moriwase was fresh and juicy. found it strange when the waiter asks if this was our first order, I asked him in return, i tot that it was unlimited servings?!? he replied yes, its just for recording purposes. The rest of the dishes were mediocre, not the freshest of food. I mean some were tasty like any other jap restn. but nothing spectacular or different or special.true enough our 2nd order of sashimi moriwase, was super fishy! almost threw up for the fishy taste. will not be back again for sure
2
Dinner at Irodori at Riverview Hotel. Concluded that the restaurant was over rated by so many local food bloggers (again I suspect the quality and culinary maturity of our food bloggers are they are simply paid / sponsor to write well hence the lack of impartiality)We started with the limited sashimi offerings were generally fresh and not too thinly sliced. The meal then slowly went downhill. The single serving grill prawns were interesting but the braised salmon head was so fishy. The sushi were like your supermarket kiosk offerings but the worst were the fried and grilled dishes. Except for the tempura prawns which were good and the grilled beef roll with straw mushrooms, the saba fish were miniscule servings and their teriyaki chicken came in mini cubes and were dry like leather.The tonkatsu pork were wafer thin and so over-fried that they were even drier than those that we get from Hainanese Curry Rice stalls.Oyaku-don was at best foodcourt standard overings.The only saving grace is the mostly friendly and efficient service staff.The place was pretty packed even for a weekday night and I guess most must have gone there because of the online reviews by bloggers or restaurant sites.Lesson learnt, you get what you pay for and avoid Japanese buffets at all cost (this is one of the highest rated Japanese buffet!!)Pay the little extra for authentic and quality Japanese food.
4
Good Japanese restaurant. They have an all you can eat option or A la cart. I took the AYCE option which was good value at $45.Good selection of Japanese food and quickly served. Its nice and crowded by locals which is always a good sign. Need to be a bit assertive to get attention but all take in good humor. Its run separately to the Hotel so you cannot charge meal to room so don't forget cash or ccHappy to return to this restaurant
4
The food at this Al La Carte Buffet is good. The price is alright considering the amount and quality of food they give you. Basically you order what you want and they will serve just enough for everyone on the table. Since it's a buffet, you can obviously ask for more. The service is good
3
If you want decent sushi/Nigiri with reasonable prices, go to Itacho. Here the advantage is that you can have a wide variety of choices. The fried things, BBQ, Te-maki, Sashimi. Sashimi is okay, but you wont bother to spend 40 dollars just to get free flow of Sashimi I guess.Nothing really special. :-
3
Went with family for lunch. I had been told beforehand that the food was OK but it wasn't authentic Japanese and I have to agree. We ordered a range of things from the menu - hand rolls, sushi, sashimi, tempura, yakitori, agedashi tofu, karaage, korokke, katsu etc etc. I have to say I love the presentation and the taste of the sashimi, esp the salmon one. The yakitori wasn't bad either. Everything else I am afraid was rather ordinary. The quality (or lack of) of the sushi - California roll falling apart, seaweed being chewy and rubbery rather than crisp - is rather a sign that it is not an authentic Japanese restaurant. The soft shell crab handrolls were tasty but they looked roughly made. There was a beef teppanyaki (I think!) dish we ordered which was absolutely tasteless so we left most of it. Other dishes were average - like the karaage, agedashi tofu, tempura. I have had better quality Japanese food at a more reasonable price at Kuishin-bo when it existed at Suntec City. Irodori is not a place I would recommend if you're looking for authentic Japanese fare
1
What can I say, I don't even bother to recommend this place to anyone. Nothing special, not fantastic, and nothing great. Bought voucher and spent less then 1 hour trying everything from the menu.
4
I like the tuna, salmon and beef plus prawn sushi served with miso soup and green tea. The environment is clean and service is good value for money
4
The food was good with decent variety. But the service was really slow once the crowds started coming in (at 7+PM)
4
The pluses are - eat as much as you like, sashimi including yellow tail, tuna, salmon, octopus and sushi and hand roll, various mini serves of teppan yaki, tempura, fried rice, ramen, curry udon or rice and cawanmushi. Minus-es - the range is not as wide as other buffet's places eg Jurong Point japanese buffet etc. - no snow crabs, boiled prawns, no desserts, free flow of coffee, tea, soft drinks.. over order your sashimi and you have to pay for wastage.The buffet is not a buffet you are used to ie not free flow and free for all, you order what you need and no limit to no of orders or same ordersFor $38 it is best value indeed and you need to book in advance if you need a table. You get a 10% off with certain cards.Enjo
5
For SGD 38 you can choose anything on the menu and as much on the menu as you like. This was an unusual style of buffet but one we felt worked very well. The food was excellent. We are lovers of Japanese food when we can get it and this was certainly amongst the best for flavour and freshness. The staff were friendly and helpful. We were staying in the hotel, River View, which made this convenient but it is worth a visit even if you are elsewhere. We didn't book but it was very busy and I think a booking would be wise. By Singapore standards this was not an expensive restaurant and made even better value when you could choose as much as you liked. It is cheaper at lunchtime I believe.
3
I have nothing about Irodori to rave about except that for the price (bout SGD38 with tax etc) it is value for money. Service is fair during weekday lunch but tends to be slow once it fills up. Easy to get a reservation despite booking an hour prior to arrival. The complimentary prawn dish was surprisingly good. I was pretty skeptical when it arrived, worrying it would be soggy and less fresh. Quality and range is good but could be better. Unagi is not on the menu and was a pretty big disappointment. I'm not a fan of rice nor tempura so my selection from the menu was pretty limited. The swordfish and tako was good but I didnt like the salmon cuts. Cawamushi was smooth, yakitori was good, enoki wrapped with pork/beef was a miss, horse mackerel sushi is good. Missing orders are a norm or for a order to arrive an hour later, totally forgotten it was even ordered. All in all, a pretty decent meal though
4
I went to Irodori on a Sunday night for dinner with a couple of friends! We had no problem ordering our food and MOST of our orders came pretty quickly, while some took as long as 20mins to come. The sashimi is very tasty so is the sushi. Although they really like putting mayo on almost every type of sushi and after a while its very overwhelming. The only dish which wasnt nice was the grilled salmon! It was incredibly dry and so this made it very hard to eat. Besides that, the rest of the dishes were great
4
Went there with my mum on Christmas day for lunch; it was packed (of course as it was public holiday).Despite that the place will filled with people, the quality of the food was maintained and the food was fresh.The service was also very good.I would invite people to come here anytime. I used to go to Ikoi but now I have to say that the food quality here is better.One proposal, i do hope they have more grilly items, such as bacon mushrooms rolls, bacon with tomato etc...Keep up the good work team. I simply love the sashimi :
4
The buffet is great and all is fresh as you order each dish from a big menu and as much as you want for a fixed price. SGD 35 ++The Sashimi is great, Tempura excellent but Daikon was missing in the sauce, all other was good and we enjoyed the food in good company. The restaurant was very busy.We will come back
3
Went there with a friend on Sunday for buffet lunch, bad idea! Came on time at 12pm and the restaurant is 80% full of families and couples, and I can see about 6 servers around. I was seated and while waiting for my friend, I wanted to order first, took 15-20 minutes to finally get a server. Turned out, out of those 6 servers, only 2 are allowed to take order hence they were running here and there to get orders taken. Anyway, the experience was not pleasant at all, waiting for the food to be served make us very hungry. We are never going back there. There is another japanese restaurant for buffet called IKOI at Miramar (right in front of the hotel where Irodori is) that server better food and fast service
4
came here after trying ikoi and shin midori, their sashimi is the better of the 3 and service crew were also faster...great value same price all day everyday...if only the voucher can use for dinner..tat would be great!
3
only have about 6 species of sashimi in this restaurant where is not a good place for sashimi eater like me. But the test is good.
4
Bought this jap buffet from deal with free flow of green tea/soft drinks. Food was good and they even give a complimentary prawn (as attached in the pic). I love the taste of it! It's so nice! Restaurant was packed, which really surprised me as I've not heard of this restaurant before. Service was fast even though restaurant was packed and we got our food without waiting too long. However, location can be slightly out of the way if you are not driving. We drove there but their carpark was full already. We had to park at the nearby king's centre. Overall, food is worth a try
4
Irodori is one of my favourite Japanese buffet in Singapore (infact, the world, except in Japan ofcourse). The food is delicious and good quality, eventhough it a buffet concept. Love the variety of sashimi, handrolls, grill dishes and deep fried food. Do make advance reservation if you intend to dine here as it is always pack. Tip - Dine early, when the crowd is not in, because you will have faster and better service, i.e around 6pm. When the crowd is in, it is quite a challenge to get attention to order your food and you need to follow up on your orders
4
We visited this restaurant for a birthday lunch in March 2013. We have heard recommendation before from some friends, but didn't expect too much, until we ordered and tasted the foods.They were really fresh, especially different kind of sashimis and you can order them as much as you can eat. Other foods were really great as well and a lot of selection you can order.The downside was the service was a bit slow, that's the reason why we didn't give full 5 stars in this review. Sometimes you had to remind the waitress about your orders, it's a bit annoying. But compared to the freshness you can get here, we can ignore this issue.I would surely return and recommend to others as well
4
I love Japanese Food especially Sashimi and always looking for good sashimi places. It was a last minute decision for sashimi buffet that time. We quickly went over a few places and called for the reservation. We were just very lucky to get the seats for last minute call. The restaurant was packed! The service was average but servers were attentive. You don't have to ask to refill your drinks. I was a little impressed for their attentiveness. The flow of the food was decent - the first orders came quickly but the rest of the orders were slower. But that is expected for such a busy restaurant. A wide choice of selections for Buffet, taste great and a large helping of sashimi portions. Decent Price for Buffet. Overall, this is a good dining experience
4
I must confess that I am not a fan of the Japanese cuisine. Yet I enjoyed a very good lunch set. And others in our party of six professed that this was the best Japanese restaurant in Singapore.Although I am accustomed to a buffet being of the kind where you look at the food and serve yourself from large tables with many different plates, at the Irodori it is a "buffet a la carte", i.e. you can order as much and as many different food sorts as you want, but it is not displayed and the waiters bring it to your table.And what I found most commendable was the concept of "order all what you want, but eat all you ordered". This no-waste policy is enforced with a warning in the menu: Even tjhough you paid for your buffet, whatever is left uneaten in your plate will be charged additionally to your account.Ã¢â‚¬
3
You need to make a reservation for weekend buffet dining at this popular Japanese restaurant. Service is quick for such an over crowded restaurant serving Ala Carte Buffet. The Sashimi and Sushi were fresh and well presented. All the Tempura dishes were delightful too, served piping hot and crispy! Fried Japanese croquette with vegetables and meat were yummy. However, I did not enjoy the Tepan Yaki dishes at all...beef was overcooked and cut into tiny bits. Also,you need to indicate to the waitress how many servings for each dish ordered, especially for family or group diners; otherwise you may end up with a single small portion only. Overall, everyone in my family enjoyed dining at this restaurant, plus we were surprised with the special dining vouches issued out; which I feel is a good gesture to entice loyal and returning customers

Been to this restaurant many times as I find it really good value for money. It's an a-la-carte buffet that you order from a menu, so you don't have to get your food yourself.The highlight for me would be the sashimi. The fish is fresh and thickly sliced, unlike some restaurants that slice their fish thinly and take the feel out of eating sashimi. I would order a few rounds as my friends and I are sashimi lovers. Their other items like teapot soup, pork belly with kimchi, tempura prawns, soft shell crab hand roll, etc are yummy too. One thing though, you have to specify how many portions you want each time you order. What I do is, if 4 of us are there, I'd request sashimi for 6 pax for a start. After you pay, they will give you vouchers for next visit within the month. It's a 3-pay-1-free buffet lunch voucher. Good deal.Recommende

I had dined in this restaurant for several times. Their mixed sashima is always so fresh. You can order many rounds of food and still cost only a total of $100.00 plus. Their long mushroom with cheese is tasty. Their teapot soup can be refilled many times. Their deep fried mushroom is also not bad. Their deep fried chicken is crispy in the outside and juicy in the inside too. They always give you a voucher for $41.20 at the end when you pay the bill, depending on how many people you went for the meal (i.e. if 3 people, they will give you 3 vouchers; if 6 people, they will give you 6 vouchers), though the expiry date is 1 month later. Their California roll is a bit unique too. Their servicing waiting time can be 30 minutes or more, when you go in the weekends, such as Sat or Sun
