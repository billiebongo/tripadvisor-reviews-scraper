Such a homey and cozy American diner with the best of the best in comfort food, Mac and cheese makes all my troubles go away!
4
Very conveniently located at the MRT exit. Decently quiet place to have a great meal with family/friends.
4
This place does brunch really well. Not the run-of-the-mill eggs ben you see at every other cafe. Loved the truffle potato foam with croissant. Highly recommended
4
food is nice, servings are huge too. service is great. nice hippy cafe, centrally located. easy to get to
4
My wife and I were staying at the nearby Dorsett Singapore hotel and this was our go-to place for western style foods. Great service from all the staff and friendly atmosphere no matter what time we dropped in.
3
Ordered the beef potato pancakes and seafood linguini. Decent but nothing to rave about. The service staff however was very attentive and helpful. Very impressed by the service.
5
Roosevelt's is going for an American theme and it does it well. Nice variety of western food with options that kids will enjoy. I've found that at most places in Singapore the service is pretty average, however here that was not the case. I would liken the service to that of an actual American restaurant, where the wait staff fall over themselves trying to provide good service since they need tips to survive. The bathroom even has fancy hand soap which was a cute surprise. Highly recommend
3
Love the ambiance of the restaurant. We arrived at 830pm for dinner and was surprised there were only group of guests at the table. Ordered the BBQ baby back ribs (the ribs was very tender but the seasoning was nothing spectacular), scallops (taste was good, would have been better if we had it when it was served as it was a little cold by the time we ate it) & caesar salad (this was average). I don't mind heading back to try other stuff on the menu. Service was prompt and friendly.
4
As a big meat eater this is a great option for breakfast in the Cantonment area. The menu selection is good and service was quite delightful: Friendly staff who were happy to adjust the menu to suit my wishes. Coffee was also good; not many staff know how to make a good ristretto!
4
Went in for dinner with my family of 4 adults and 2 kids. Nice decor and great service. We had the ribs, seafood casserole, chicken confit and the salmon steak. Food was good. All the mains came with a sauce or side that was slightly acidic or sour which helped cleanse the palette and not make the food cloying. Portions are reasonably generous for the prices. Only thing that didn't go down too well was the strawberries and cream waffle. The ricotta cheese was infused with rose flavor which wasn't really well received
5
Roosevelt served great food and service was good. I had the squid ink fish & chips. Highly recommended! Would come back to try their brunch menu next time.
4
Interesting ambiance. Ordered Berry Banana Smoothie, Truffle Potato Foam with Croissant and Beef Cheek on Potato Pancake. Totally love the Beef Cheek. I personally felt that there is nothing much to rave about the Truffle Potato Foam.
4
It is very accessible as it is just right beside the MRT exit. Staff were very friendly and the food served were great too. Recommend to make a reservation to avoid disappointment. Will definitely revisit.
4
Multiple visits to Roosevelt's was prompted by the courteous service and the good food. Don't miss comfort food is the jalapeno man and cheese. Great baby back ribs. Spectacular sea bass pie.
4
Good brunch variety. Service staff was attentive. But was quite warm in the day despite being indoors.
3
I only tried the Truffle Eggs Benedict and I thought it was quite interesting. This is one of the few cafes that have eggs benedict with different kinds of hollandaise sauce available. But I feel that pricing was a bit on the high side and the portion was a bit small. But atmosphere was great and stuff were super helpful and friendly
4
Loved the atmosphere and design of the place. Mains were range of 20-30$ but they were very interesting and refreshing options, such as the beef cheek potato pancake. We were hoping that they would offer smaller portions at a cheaper price so that we would be able to try more of the items on the menu! :
5
The dishes that we ordered were truffle mac and cheese, smoked salmon benedicts, scrambled eggs and toast, mixed berry waffles. The dish that we enjoyed the most was the waffles which was really crispy yet fluffy, and went well with the ice cream. The tinge of sourness from the berries together with the sweetness of the ice cream left us wanting for more, it is really addictive! Just a side note, the cheese flavor of the truffle Mac and cheese was a little too strong toward the end
4
We were very impressed by the food there. Highly recommend the squid ink waffles (though not a strong taste of squid ink, quite fluffy) & strawberries & cream waffles (crispy with a slight tinge of liquor taste in the cream). The coffee was good but we'll probably give the tea a miss next time. Overall, ambience was great, & the service staff was very friendly (thanks for always making sure we had enough water)

My friends and I made a reservation here on a Saturday, May 21, via Chope at 10AM and the operating hours indicates "Opens at 8:30am". We have made a decision to have breakfast there since we are working at noon in a place nearby. Arriving early before the reserved time, the diner is closed. One staff inside told us that they are open only for coffee orders. My friend showed to them our confirmed reservation via Chope. The manager on duty was called when we complained, telling us that the website and Chope were not updated. They can only accomodate us with coffee and pancakes. No other dishes. Since we are expecting for brunch foods, we didn't go in. And we even told the MOD to update their website and Chope because it is really misleading. She told us that they notified Chope with their operating hours few weeks back, but when we complained to Chope the incident, they said on their end that Roosevelt's Diner didn't inform them about the changes. So now, we really don't know who's telling the truth
4
This is a pretty good place to meet up with friends. Close to an MRT, reasonably priced food and drinks (a little on the exxy side) and a nice atmosphere.
5
Nice cafe setting, great place for catch up, rest and relax. The staff are friendly and attentive. Recommend.
4
The service was good as well as the food. I could enjoy the romantic atmosphere with my boyf since the moment I've stepped into the restaurant !
4
Food & drinks are good, only suggestion is that the cafe is quite warm and the fans/air-conditioning might not be enough. Also, please provide coasters for the cold drinks to avoid tables getting wet all the time. Other than these, overall are great! :)
4
Flat white and milk shake were all good. Very near MRT. Poached eggs were normal, however the muffin was not bad. Would go there again.
3
we had the salted caramel waffles and it was disappointing because the waffles were so overcooked to the point that it was too crispy and the inside was totally dried up. salted caramel was just some sauce drizzled on the plate too. definitely expected more. standard has dropped since my previous visit :
2
My first visit was very pleasant. Food was awesome. Thus I recommended my friends to visit with me again. This time the food portion was pathetic. We ordered the Truffle Fish Pie but could only find 2 to 3 small pieces of fish in a the relatively huge pie. Service was not very professional. Only good thing - they served the mains at one time so we managed to all eat at the same time. Appreciate that as some places don't practise it. With the quality of food there, I feel that the price is totally not worth it. It's definitely overpriced.
5
This is a cozy little diner with a warm ambience. The food is quite varied and we enjoyed a BBQ rib and chicken, both of which were excellent. We tried the Salted Caramel milkshake which is highly rated but found it a little too sweet. The staff service is very good - friendly, attentive and keeps your glass of water filled
4
nice and cozy place with no loud music.ordered the baby back ribs (half rack) and the meat was fall off the bone tender. Wish the portion were larger though.The churros waffle had a super crispy exterior with slight chewy interior served with a not so sweet mocha deep. Overall, i am satisfied with the meal.
4
In Summary:With reasonably good food with a slightly higher than average price, this place offers great ambience and convenience to those looking for a good chill-out spot or people-watch.*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:After a highly unsatisfying meal at one of the restaurants in Clarke Quay, my group decided to try this place out after a casual suggestion. We were pleasantly surprised that they were open to reservation even on a late Saturday afternoon and we headed down to find a lively café which was not overcrowded. We initially wanted to head off soon after our meal but the place has that homely feel that makes you want to stay and chat. That’s what we did and ended up having dinner too.1. Service – 4 out of 5Timely, courteous and non-intrusive, making this place a nice and quiet hangout spot. Service crew attended to our requests swiftly.2. Ambiance – 4 out of 5Environment is good for people watching and it is well decorated and ventilated, a point which I appreciate as most cafes have open concept kitchens which stinks a lot during peak hours.3. Cleanliness – 5 out of 5Nothing that we can fault.4. Taste – 3.5 out of 5Food and drinks were above average, but nothing especially spectacular. Both cups of coffee that we ordered had nice foam art and the drinks tended more to the roasted side. The potato bacon hash was good, but nothing really memorable. The pork belly Benedict tasted really subdued, which was quite a waste as we were expecting much from the beautiful coat of BBQ sauce. The crab cake Benedict was slightly disappointing though as it was the priciest yet lack oomph. You can be sure that it really contains crabmeat though. The saving grace came in the form of dessert, which was savoury and refined. The waffles with ice cream really went well together, leaving a satisfactory aftertaste with every mouthful. The Granola was flavourfully sweet and you can constantly deceive yourself that you are having something healthy and tasty at the same time.5. Value for Money – 3.5 out of 5It must be quite a feat to survive at its current location, with well-known restaurants and cafes literally in the neighbourhood. Some of the items at Roosevelt’s are definitely priced slightly above its neighbours. But if you value ambience and convenience, this place is a must-visit location on your list
4
Great place! Cosy cafe for weekend brunch! Not very crowded. But the food was nicer when I went there months ago.
4
I love this lil cosy café. But great place for breakfast/brunch. They have good coffee and tea. Great waffle. Service was good. Not exactly cheap tho.
5
Good food and location and environment makes the whole session feeling comfortable and cosy. Will return again.
4
Warm welcome by the staff who are prompt and attentive. Coffee here is good and aromatic. Quite an extensive menu offered from all day breakfast to burgers.
5
The place is cosy, great ambience and design and most important the staff are friendly and helpful. The coffee art from the staff is awesome and definitely a great chill out place with friends for a cosy afternoon
4
Upon sitting down, we were served water (soaked with lemons in a jug). Decent service, I gauge.I read up on this cafe-like diner before coming and my experience matched up with the comments, 'good food' 'hipster-like', etc. The ambience here certainly is hipster, very Instagrammable.Good place to have a casual brunch. The waffles I tried were fluffy, very ideal
3
My hubby and I went to Roosevelt's for breakfast on a weekday morning. It was out first time there. Based on the positive review read so far we were excited or at least I was.My hubby ordered their "big breakfast" which was quickly warned by the staff to be HUGE. He also ordered cappuccino.For me I had a sweet tooth going that morning so I had the waffles with ice cream and a chocolate milkshake.Hubby's verdict - Big breakfast was not huge. We have seen bigger portions. Tasteless overall especially the eggs. For the first time, hubby had to add salt to his breakfast. Didn't like the sausages too. Coffee was the saving grace for him. It was at least good.My verdict - love love love the waffles. They were very crispy which is best eaten hot and together with the cold ice cream. It was a match in heaven. My milkshake was thick might be an overkill for me having so much sweet that morning but it was a good milkshake overall. Milkshake dinosaur.Ambience of the place is great. Quiet and by the window so that you can people watch. Convenient location as it is just next to the Outram MRT. Would be an ideal place for catching up with friends or just an alone time to catch up on reading
5
Seriously amazing food at this little diner. My wife & I are waffle-ist and we can claim its the best one we had so far in this planet (yes- way better than the ones we received in wafflehouses in US). The atmosphere is very casual and we will def return for the burgers. For the mains we ended up with the crab cake benedicts - steep in price but it was worth it. Coffees were smooth
4
Nice place and friendly staff. Ordered a Deep Fried Chicken and Prawn Burger.The food was pretty good. The chicken had a peppery flavour quite wonderful. The prawn burger was simple and had a unique taste, pretty good stuff. Ordered latte and mocha. Nothing went right or wrong here
4
The diner is kinda small so a reservation is definitely recommended. The staff was very attentive and I have no problems getting their attention at all. The food was supposed to be american but it was more of a fusion than true american. Ordered their BBQ ribs and the breakfast platter and their coffee. Their ribs was too sweet for my liking and lack of the authentic southern BBQ flavor but will definitely suit the local. Their coffee was good. Definitely worth a trip down there
4
Good food and fast service. Definitely must try the Truffle Fries and Salt Caramel Waffles!!! Delicious!
5
Waffle was crispy and fluffy, priced reasonably, great ambience and staffs are friendly. Conveniently located right outside of Outram Park Exit E.
5
the birthday surprise for my boyf wouldn't have been a success if not for the staff here! thanks JR!
3
I love the ambience with the right lighting & comfortable seats. Not forgetting the good service we enjoyed. Fine place to chill & get home easily as it's just right where the Outram MRT station is.The only thing that would make the restaurant even more attractive is to bring the food prices lower as portions were average and sides were not as generous
5
We were staying around the corner here and stumbled Upon it half was through our trip, however we then frequented this fantastic diner/restaurant for our breakfast/lunch and dinners every day for the rest of our trip. Fantastic service, great food and value for money. The best berry granola crumble in town
5
Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday, and the ambience was nice and comfortable. Quite a hip cafe. They have a wide selection of cafe foods to choose from, from typical eggs benedict to truffle mac & cheese or southern chicken wings etc.Berry banana smoothie and salted caramel milkshake tasted great. They kept our water glasses filled too - it was really excellent attentive service
5
Had dinner with my friend there. They gave us a quiet and cozy corner, perfect for us to sit and catch up about life. Had been a fan of their bolognese since I first had it, one of the best and I would definitely recommend the place to my friends. 
5
We went to Roosevelt's for brunch. The waffles served, both savoury and sweet, were excellent - crispy yet delicately fluffy. The ambience was casual and relaxed and the service was relatively good. The flourless chocolate cake was however a disappointment as it was too dense. However, will certainly go back for another round of waffles
5
My husband and I went there on a Saturday and had a very pleasant surprise. We ordered Big breakfast and truffle eggs on Waffle. The eggs for both was very good. And the waffle was easily one of the best I have ever had. It's crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. We also had a cappuccino and mocha and they were very good too. I enjoyed the food so much that I wiped both plates clean! Would definitely go back again. :)
4
This little diner is beside the Outram Park MRT station. We had two breakfasts and two dinners here. It was close to our hotel and so much more reasonable than the hotel. I love trying local foods when I travel but there is something about breakfast that requires traditional Western food for me. My husband treated himself to the salted caramel milkshake, loved it and is determined to try making it at home. The menu is quite limited but the food is good, reasonable by Singapore standards and the diner has very attentive service
4
Roosevelt Cafe, located at outram MRT Exit H, is a typical American style cafe. Rugged decor, dangling light bulbs, dim lighting. They have happy hour for house pours until 8pm. Their salted caramel milkshake is a must order and really awesome!

Very consistent service and food taste and quality everytime! They are customer-centric and professional!
4
Went in after the rain and my umbrella dropped on the floor after an accidental knock. The wait staff immediately went to get a bag hook for me to hang the umbrella. Kudos! :) Good food too, the truffle baked eggs was delish!
4
Great food. Great service. Nice ambience. Nice place for gatherings and parties. Will go back again for brunch.
4
Conveniently located to mrt exit, service crew were friendly & efficient, food taste great too! Will be back for 2nd time. :)
4
Went down based on the highly rated recommendations online. The diner is conveniently located literally a stone's throw away from the Outram Park MRT Exit H. Basic parameters:- Staff to diner ratio: above average, no issue getting attention of a waiter- Prices: average for brunch cafes- Ambience: Great decor, dined from 12pm-1pm, was not crowded, full glass windows let in a lot of light. - Speed: Got our orders within 10 minutes- Service: Had to prompt the waiter to refill water, serve coffee, otherwise okay- Food: Presentation is excellent. Ordered eggs benedict, they used some normal ham instead of prosciutto thus no saltiness whatsoever; hollandaise sauce was quite bland, but eggs were perfectly cooked. Ordered waffles: tasted good just a tad bit too crunchy nearly biscuit like, but enjoyed the truffle scrambled eggs.Would not be able to fully recommend this place yet given the choices of better options just nearby around Tanjong and Duxton, but wasn't a disappointment by itself
5
Try their brunch menu Crab Cake Benedict, that's a to die for! Came here without much expectations but was wowed away by their benedict and churros waffles. yes you saw right, churros waffles. Yummy, yummy food. It was rather peaceful when I came last Sunday morning, but shortly after I arrived the restaurant started filling up and was full house. Yet the service didn't fall flat on its face and the servers politely asked me if I wanted any coffee, topped my water up, and gave me extra napkins when I spilled my drink on myself, all without missing a heartbeat. thumbs up
5
We were there on 3 July. My girlfriend is heavily pregnant and asked for a burger with the patty done medium rare, the male server was gentle & quick to share that a well-done portion may be better for her. Kudos to their thoughfulness!!! Food meet all expectations and the ambience is condusive for get-together sessions with girlfriends and partners
4
I didn't manage to try a lot of food, but I got the berries waffles and it was alright. Not amazing but passable. The hot chocolate was good. There was a 50% discount if you bought a hot drink with your dessert so it was quite value for money! Food came fast as well. I loved the ambience though. The place wasn't crowded and it was relaxing to catch up with an old friend there. 
4
Went for a Sunday brunch menu, didn't eat, but it looked good and was rather crowded. Returned for dinner and had the veggie burger, with a substitute of mash over the fries (it's made with pumpkin, potatoes, and sweet potatoes and is absolutely delicious). They have good coffee drinks, good fresh fruit juice and smoothies, and a casual western-menu. If I were a resident of Singapore, I'd return again. Free wifi was lovely, too
3
The one for one waffle only valid for one set.Many other restaurants normally allow at least two set of 1-1.
2
This was the first time I was told after I have settled my bills and 15min before 10pm and again at 10pm.I suggest the place should stop taking orders at 9pm and tell the people who came at 9pm that.Bad customer service and EQ
4
Firstly, the service is commendable. Guests were greeted with a warm welcome and served iced water upon arrival, which is rare in Singapore. However, my order of Truffle Scrambled Egg Waffle was a tad disappointing. No doubt the flavour of truffle was sufficient, it soon became quite unpalatable. Perhaps cooking the egg with salmon bits would be better. Nonetheless, the Churros Waffle was a much pleasant delight. Word of advice: share the waffles
3
Roosevelt's Diner & Bar has very delicious dessert. We had the rum banana and the waffles with salmon and yogurt. They were also a generous portion for the price, especially for the rum banana. However we were greatly disappointed by the unprofessional service we received . Here's what happened to us:There is dessert promotion of getting your second dessert for 50% with a BOC (bank of china) cards. Before we ordered, my friend asked the waiter if her BOC unionpay card is applicable for the promotion. The waiter said yes. All went well with the bill but another waiter came back to us to say that the machine doesn't register the discount because it is a unionpay card. He insisted that we can't use the card or get the discount even though we told him we told we could in the beginning. We then spotted the unionpay card picture on the promotional leaflet on the table and pointed to him. He then reluctantly gave us the discount with a new bill. But while the previous bill had the discount on the dessert that cost more, this bill's discount was the dessert that cost less, thus with lesser discount.I do not mind the money. But I find the change of bill and discounts very unprofessional and a lack of integrity. Why has the discount changed to a different dessert? It seems like a penalty to the customer for pointing out the restaurant's mistake.
5
Was there for lunch today, and they were completely packed. However, the wait staff politely came over when I was seated, explaining that there might be a slight delay as all the guests came in at pretty much the same time. Iced water was served promptly even though they were busy serving tables and attending to orders, and they kept checking in to topup the glass. Waiters were knowledgeable about their menu and recommendations were good. Even though the restaurant was full, that didn't affect the food quality in the least. The spaghetti bolognese tasted fresh, was cooked just right, and surprisingly one of the better ones I've had in Singapore. Given the standard of food, at $12 for their set lunch, it was very reasonable. Other casual dining operators should be scribbling down notes from Roosevelts.Attentive and sincere wait staff who are prompt and efficient, and that says alot in Singapore (where most places are just apathetic about customer service). These folks really put in alot of effort and heart in making sure that customers are well taken care of. Two thumbs up
5
I've heard my Indonesian friends raving about Roosevelt's for a while now, so decided to try them out since I was staying at Dorsett. It certainly didn't disappoint! The churros was done perfect, light and fluffy with a crisp cinnamon crust and dark chocolate sauce to go with it. Hands down the best waffles I've ever had.The Crab cake benedict was unique with its contrast of spices, textures, and flavours. My husband had the Candied Bacon Waffle- yes candied bacon with waffle! It was a combination that totally rocked with the fried egg and tomato relish they served. We tried the signature salted caramel milkshake too, and that was by far one of the better milkshakes I've ever had! Overall, their pricing is also one of the better value ones I've seen around in Singapore. The staff are really friendly and sincere, the food hits a spot, and the ambience is lush and great for chilling out on a lazy morning. I'm pretty certain I'll be making this my regular haunt
4
I've walked past Roosevelt's on my previous few stays at Dorsett hotel, but decided to try them out on a recent trip.Boy was I glad I did! Their staff Mark recommended their new brunch menu, and we ordered the Spiced potato hash and smoked salmon waffle. The hash was flavourful and beautiful with the tomato relish, and the smoked salmon had generous portion of yogurt on top the fluffy crisp waffle. Excellent food, coffee was decent, and it helped that they offered us free Wifi too. Its lovely interior, jazzy soundtracksa reminded me of New York! Will be back for sure on my next trip to Singapore
5
I was stuck at the Outram Park MRT exit because of a strong downpour. Looked around and saw a little bar and decided to stop for a drink. I was very impressed with the menu and and had a PorkBelly Cubano sandwich that was pretty good but I was more interested in coming back to try their breakfast. Glad I did! I came on a Sunday and tried the crab cake Benedict. It was fantastic. Service was prompt and the food delicious. I like the atmosphere. Stumbled into a place that I like and with enough drinks I can stumble out of it too.
3
Hopped by Roosevelt's with a friend - she mentioned Salted Caramel Milkshake and i was sold! We ordered to share: Truffle Scrambled Egg Waffles, the Vegetarian Deep Fried Burger, and the Salted Caramel Milkshake of course! The Waffles were nice and fluffy, the eggs a little runnier than I'd have liked but the delicate truffle seasoning made me overlook the texture. The Burger was more like Sloppy Joes, the filling was all over the place and a little too oily. It did say deep fried but this was more like pan fried with generous helpings of oil! The milkshake was creamy, thick, and delicious - complete justice to its reputation. I may go by again if I'm in the area, for the milkshake. The breakfast is just about average
3
I reserved a table at Roosevelt's, through Chope, to celebrate my partner's birthday. Ambience was lovely with dim lightings, staff was friendly and attentive when we stepped in. But staff did not inform that the Chope promotion of 1-for-1 was limited to only maximum 1 redemption per table. We ordered 2 mains and 2 milkshakes and were charged for the 2nd milkshake. On asking, then the staff revealed. The food can be also be better - BBQ ribs were burnt and had a bitter taste
4
my friend loved his lemongrass prawn burger, I liked my cubano, and my other thought the southern fried chicken needed more southern love :0
however we were unanimous that the coffees were excellent
4
We visited for breakfast on a Saturday morning, service was fantastic and food and drinks were delicious.
4
Food was alright. Service provided by the 2 male filipinos was good. Loved the selection of music they played but unfortunately since I was there for a casual business meet up, we were struggling to hear ourselves.
4
Being the practical Singaporean that I am, I wouldn't normally use the word "cool" to describe a restaurant/cafe. Is the food tasty? How are the portions? Is it good value? In this case, I'll just throw all those questions out of the window. Roosevelt's is a small diner tucked in a corner of the same building that also houses Dorsett Hotel. We had some beer food (chicken wings, truffle fries, calamari) which were decent and some pasta which were also ok. But the place is so nicely decorated with a Williamsburg feel and the service so warm, all that is pedestrian is forgiven. Would come back with my co-workers for a drink again.
4
went to this place with a group of 8 and the food was good. We went there around noon and I had the Roosevelt eggs. It was really good but a bit greasy. The Coffee was really good as well. Overall I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a nice breakfast. Service was bad but that seems to be the standard in Singapore so nothing out of the ordinary. I had one breakfast and 2 cappuccinos for about $30. My friends had the southern fried chicken and it looked really good. Another had the vegetarian pasta and the serving was really small and definitely not worth getting. The lemon grass burger looked really good but according to my friend, he did not like it
2
Bad service. lots of available seats at the time we visited (12noon), was given a small table as compared to other ang moh/tourists (2 people as well) but were given a bigger table. It s ok if they are having full house and we are given smaller table, but that s not the case. Not to mention, they even allow filming crew to have their artist make-up and hair done at the restaurant. Zzz. Food taste was ok and a little overprice compare to other cafe/bar.
5
Whilst staying close by we decided to try this quirky diner. We didn't feel like a big meal and so shared some BBQ baby back ribs which were sticky and delicious but slightly on the small size (they were baby after all!). The merlot from Chile hit the spot and Mark looked after us wonderfully. We were enjoying this place so much and as it was our last night in Singapore, we decided on more wine and a lovely dessert which didn't disappoint. The breakfast menu looked good and so we went back the next morning. The honey granola with greek yoghurt was yummy and the eggs Roosevelt with chorizo and hollandaise sauce, served over potatoes was a different twist on the traditional breakfast items on offer. If you are staying next door at the Dorsett you will get discount when you show your room key. Would highly recommend
4
We have been coming here since it opened. The food here is generally very good. The standards are however variable. There are a couple of excellent servers who know exactly what they are doing and then quite a few who I don't think even know why they are there. The rib portions used to be served in half and full rack size. It's now only half and the portion is very small. The size of sides varies from generous to anemic. The waffles and desserts in general are flawless. I would say consistency is something that needs to be worked on but if you go on a good day you'll definitely be back a lot, considering its a diner it could also doing with being open later at weekends
4
Definitely one of the chic places in Singapore and conveniently located on New Bridge road. Brunch is sumptuous and the selection of wine and coffee is good. Good promos to be explored. Ambience is excellent with 3 side ceiling high glass allowing lot of natural light in.... Nice place to relax for coffee and reading too. Must visit for Brunch lovers. Try the Teddy's big brunch.
4
Came here for breakfast with our 2 kids and the diner was already filling up. But thankfully the staff specially arranged a spacious corner seat for us to accomodate our kids (my son has autism and doesn't do well with cramped spaces or loud noises). It was really sweet and helpful of them, constantly checking in to see if we're comfortable or needed anything. Service here is all smiles and we were attended to promptly by the staff, who gave pretty spot-on recommendations. The portions here are big, and all the dishes we had were very yummy. Give the big breakfast, truffle scrambled eggs, and eggs roosevelt a try! Kids' omelette here made from soy milk rather than milk, and the kids loved it. Free Wifi, strong creamy coffee, and great service. It's particularly family friendly as they offered the kids crayons and paper to doodle on while waiting for the food. Couldnt ask for more
4
I went there for a Sunday Brunch.
The quality of the food was not bad, but I really liked the place for its ambience and music.
5
The staffs are very attentive and good service. Food is very good especially their Fish Pie. They are having promotion for 1 for 1 housepour wine & beer till 8pm.
5
Love the ambience.
Great to hang out, fantastic place to work & eat when you are travelling on business alone.
Will be back.

My 3 good friends and I went to Roosevelt on Thursday Sept 11, 2014 at 21:28 for supper. Joan the part time waitress told us rudely that the kitchen is closed. Mark the Filipino Mgr said: we only open till 10.30pm on Sat. We went to The Reading Room only 150 metres away where we had a marvellous time. This rude and customer unfriendly approach is DEPLORABLE! It takes months, even years to find a customer but only seconds to lose one...Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling GourmetTM is a celebrated Travel, Food and Wine Writer/Edito

Everytime I've stayed at the Dorsett Hotel, I'd pretty much spend most of my meals here. It's THAT good. It's particularly a life saver cos they serve great breakfast here at pretty cheap prices, so I don't have to suffer the unimpressive breakfast at the Dorsett hotel restaurant.They've recently started offering free Wifi, which comes in really handy. Coffee here is superb, and the food is consistently great. Burgers here are awesome, I've tried every single one of them. Service staff are friendly and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and at home
4
A big group of ladies for lunch. Some of us had sandwiches, fish and chips, burgers. Not one complain about the food everyone was happy. The service staff was attentive and polite. The place is at the corner of the Dorsett Residence and near the Mrt exit
5
First up, this place has got a warm, cosy and beautiful interior. It's got a great coffee that's flavourful, robust, chocolatey, and smooth. Wifi here is free, so just ask the staff for the wifi password. That said, this place has really attentive service, with a friendly barista who'd explained to me the different beans in the blend of coffee when I'd asked. Even though it was a busy weekend brunch, the staff had great personality and delivered excellent service, from being efficient in order taking, to having a little chat with me in between refilling my ice water for me.

Dropped by this hidden gem near Chinatown for brunch in April. Ambience is good and service is excellent. Cafe Manager is very cheery as well. The Coffee is very strong here. Perfect to wake you up on a sleepy sunday! :)The berries Waffles are well made with lots of fruits and sauces to go along with the crispy golden waffles. Same good standards goes for the eggs Benedict-- everything done nicely. Will be back to try out their dinner some day

Well kept secret for now but I really hope this restaurant does well. Better ribs than both Jerry's and Smokeys, lovely decor, casual in a cool way and great staff and the calamari seemingly made from scratch and also perfectly cooked. Good wine, everything well priced. Will be back. Cannot recommend highly enough

We went there as a group of friends on a Saturday night. Cool spot with interesting decor. Not close to crowded but that may change since the food was pretty good. Prices were reasonable too. I'd definitely head back for mid-priced good western food. A classier and more interesting alternative to places like Astons, but similar prices.Mixed and matched some dishes to try everything. Ribs were pretty good, probably the top choice. I had the burger as well which got pretty messy if i'm honest. diced/chopped onion was inside the patty which some people liked and others didn't.Good wine selection and they also had some Spanish beers - could do with a bit more variety on the beers... could also do with one more waiter - just one guy and he was pretty rushed.Overall a positive experience and i'd definitely go back
