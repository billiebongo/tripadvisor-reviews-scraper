A 18 counter seating Japanese restaurant offering great value for a Bara Charashi lunch starting $12.95++ Great taste and self helping to appetizers. It’s always long queue during the work days. Try going after 1:30pm on weekend

Portion is good for the price paid. Very fresh ingredients! Staff are funny and nice. Not only a place for food. You get entertained too!

Very good barachirashi (salmon seafood) bowl! They offer good service as well with all the freebies on the side including radish and cabbage. Priced at $17.50 all in. This is really a satisfying lunch.

Teppei always serve best bara and higawari ( special of the day ). All their employees also very friendly

It is a fantastic place. One if the best sushi bars I have ever been. Fantastic food, great atmosphere. Teppei San is fantastic chef. I don't know how to describe this experience, you have to go to understand.

Was quite difficult to get a reservation but it proved to be totally worth it. Was quite concerned that the seating might be lacking privacy, but thanks to our neighbours and the restaurant staff, it turned out to be a very pleasant experience. The food might be super good looking, but tasty and has a lot of variety. And the omakase is of very good value. The staff are super friendly and tried their best to put on a good show. Would love to come back again

I was always wondering whats the hype over this place and what is so special about this place. I was thinking to myself the food must be absolutely delicious. I was asked by a friend to try it out and she managed to get a reservation surprisingly as i was told you need to book months in advance. When we arrived, we waited abit for the first seating guests to leave. When we were asked to seat, i saw how small the restaurant is and they were packing the chairs so close to each other and obviously we will all be packed like sardines! It was terribly uncomfortable and i was wondering how am i going to survive 2hours of dinner. I was rubbing shoulders with another stranger next to me and i had no breathing space at all! I was so tempted to leave halfway through... the not so working airconditioners made things worse. There were many dishes and were served very quickly like a factory production line. As i was sitting at the bar table and could see that the way the food ingredients were stored and handled... i only could say is i wish I hadn’t seen it! One i interesting was chawan mushi as it was served in a nicely cut top off eggshell but that also became my Nightmare when i saw them collecting the eggshells to be wash them for reuse!!! I could see the lady washing the eggshells carefully before leaving them on the rack to dry off! This is really a no-no for me and i will definitely never return. There was some entertainment but it was no fun for me especially when a chef wanted to stuff food into my mouth! What fun is there... i get it... if u just want really cheap omakase for many dishes but do not care about quality and comfort then you will be fine.

We entered the restaurant on time at 8.40pm and dinner ended at 10.30pmThe chefs are interactive and they will come and feed you using spoons. So don't be shy.Food was delicious and prices were reasonably priced. The MRT is nearby and there are plenty of hotels nearby.You will need to make advance booking via online and stick with it else you may lost your deposit.If you have been to Japan, you can see that Teppei is a different experience so pls manage your own expectations

I liked the idea of affordable Omakase in comparison to the extremely expensive options for classic Omakase. I went their with an open mind and reading the reviews I was fully aware they do not do a sashimi + nigiri omakase only. I had always wondered how a cheaper version of Omakase would be so I was keen to explore their interpretation. However generally speaking $100++ for Omakase is not particularly cheap because for the amount of money, one can savour an excellent dining option in SG. And if you want Omakase, I have had Omakase's for $80-$140 which were wonderful. I think because this joint attracts the kind of customer who do not want to shed a lot of money and want to have a Omakase experience for cheaper, Teppei is focused on giving their customers value for money. I understand that. But the result is a myriad of dishes, seriously I couldnt believe the variety and volume of dishes they served and the portion sizes. I am big man and I was already full half way through dinner. But the biggest disappointment was the place itself and the poor executiion of dishes. One gets the feeling of factory style production instead of the Art of Omakase. Most of the raw ingredients looked like they werent stored properly so their appearance and smell was off putting. The chefs execution in every dish looked chaotic and messy. The fatty tuna was chewy, the oyster smelled funky, the wagyu beef tasted of sour blood. Need I say more. I think this place could have good potential if it cleaned its premises properly, had more proper storage procedures for raw produce and most importantly focus on quality instead of quantity. They would be able to impress me a lot if they only served half of the dishes they served but if they executed it properly and charm

I’d heard a lot about this omakase Restaurant so was eager to try. However it didn’t start off brilliantly. The starter platter was a touch better than horrid as everything tasted a little bland, even the tofu in a balloon was gimmicky rather than great. Luckily things got better after that. Next came the sashimi which was fresh and melt in the mouthy type stuff. The chawamushi in an egg shell was cute. Next came a his and hers sized sushi hand roll (guys size was very big). After that an oyster (fresh and delicious), then an eel dish rich in soy sauce and flavour, then assorted little bites in spoons and on sticks, before a sliced fish in soup dish and two slices of wagyu beef. To be honest by this stage I was stuffed, but then came a delicious fried rice dish with wagyu beef (which we had selected earlier, but on hindsight I might have chosen something smaller if I’d known). The rice was very tasty and the beef was thicker chunks than the previous slices of wagyu, so was enjoyable in a different way. Finally the ice cream was served and by then I was done. All in all it was a delicious feast for only eighty dollars (not including GST and tax) which in books is great value for money for the food on offer. The service was generally fun, including a few spoon dishes the cooks insisted on literally ‘feeding you’. Although we did have an over-attentive waiter who decided to randomly tell us about his trips to japan. Anyway if you fancy a omakase treat, this is delicious and good value for your money

One of the best meals I've ever had in my life, and better than the omakase I had at Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo. So, so satisfying and so, so heavenly. Shut up and take my money!

This hugely popular ! They dunt take reservation so arrive before 11.45am. The Kaisendon set was value for money at $17.60 and I even pack for my dotter ! Rem to add umi ..

It was our first time. The place was packed on a Wednesday night. There were two sittings. 6.30 pm -8.30 pm and 8.40 pm - 10.30pm. We made reservations for the second sitting. There were a total of 28 people. From the outside, the place looked small and cramp. Actually we had walked past the restaurant twice, missing it because there was no proper signage and there wasn’t anyone queuing outside (everyone was inside. We were there at 8pm) so we had to wait. When it was near 8.30pm, crowd start building up. There’s no proper table. It’s all bar sitting with seats being determined by waitress. Place is really small so expect some shoulder rubbing. It’s not that hot and stuffy as what we expected. However air ventilation wasn’t optimal so expect your hair and clothes to smell after dinnerThe food was awesome. I lost count how many dishes in total. Maybe between 16-18. Sashimi were fresh. They served ootoro so that’s a plus point. The entire meal cost $80 with ootoro and wagyu beef among the dishes. Towards the end, each diner gets to choose a main dish and desert. The choices for main dishes were either sushi, sashimi, Uni with fried rice, wagyu with fried rice or sashimi don. While desert were choice of various flavored ice cream. They were either black sesame, yuzu, green tea, salted caramel. We had wagyu fried rice and Uni fried rice with black sesame ice cream. Unfortunately The fried rice wasn’t great. Too much black pepper while the wagyu was slightly over cook and the Uni had a sort-of-not-fresh smell. We recognize this Uni smell as the same smell we experienced when we were in Tokyo market and we bought the Uni and consumed it much later. The chawanmushi served was really smooth and tasty. The kitchen staff were friendly and very interactive with all the diners. I find that the best seats are always directly in the middle where you get to watch how they prepared and also talk to them. They usually will give you some extras to taste. Apparently they change their menu every mid month. The guy next to me went there four times. I would definitely go back again. Reservations are a must to avoid disappointment. However don’t expect a nice romantic ambience. It’s more like a small ramen shop ambience.

The chef makes really fresh and delicious Barachirashi here. The fresh seafood are cut into small cube size and marinated with sauce that is mixed by the chef. The portion of the seafood is very generous and it only cost less than SGD17 excluding GST. One can get limitless serving of miso soup and side dish of the day. Lunch queue is super long and have to wait for 30-60 minutes as the restaurant has limited counter seats. Best to go after 1.45pm as the lunch crowd has subside. Alternative, one has to start queuing at 11.30am to wait for them to open at 11.45am.I will try to go for their dinner as one part of the restaurant is for Omakase while the other part is for walk in

I've been here a few times now and each time I thoroughly enjoy myself. The first time was oh so unique. The experience was a memory of a lifetime, trying flavours I've never had before and Teppei and his staff make the whole experience fun, rather than focusing on the pretentious fancier side of a dining experience.I took friends from LA here who dine all round the world, they said this meal would be US$1000 if it was in LA.Go without expectations, take with you nothing but an open mind and forget about the lack of decor and rough looking open kitchen and don't forget that dining out is sometimes purely about food, and Teppei is all about the food

I gave average points because of the mixed experience I came with high expectations since it was always full and wait list was up to months worth The pros Reservation was easy and response was fast Service crew seem to have a lot of fun behind the counters and made do with very little space, doing their tasks amid the intenses heat and managing customer orders The value was worth for $80 omakase set - we had more than 8 dishes excluding little delights on spoons or toothpicks such as Japanese tomatoes, grape, seaweed, raw fish etc in between dishes. Cons It was incredibly cramped - the lady next to me was jabbing her elbow into my ribs several times during the dinner Ventilation was a nightmare - It felt like being in a heated kitchen and i had to get out of the restaurant few times to take some fresh air as it was much cooler outside. I ended up selling like a BBQ fish at end of meal. Service was inconsistent - at times super fast between some dishes then an incredibly long wait for the next one. The chef kept checking with the Neighbour if her food was ok but totally ignored us My husband was given a hand roll twice the size of mine I asked and was told that he's bigger and needed more food.I wished they could tell us what is served instead of dumping in front of us. We didn't really know what was served and had to keep asking I could see the chefs preparing food and I was grossed out - the fish was burnt at the BBQ pit and he was trying his best to scrape out the burnt bits and used the same hands to manage other food.Two other chefs preparing the raw fish were wiping their sweat off brows, wiping hands on a cloth, opening cupboards and doing other stuff before service. I like open concept but this type of openness was too much to stomach pun.The music was played at the volume of a disco - so loud it was hard to have a decent conversation. It doesn't help the Neighbous were screaming to heard above the din Would I recommend someone to go to this place ? If you want value for money omakase and to try this place that so many people rave about but if you want the ambience then pay more and go somewhere else.

Probably one of the worst meals I've ever had in my life (definitely THE worst once you factor in the price). You get the lowest grade imaginable for the "expensive" looking ingredients - uni smelling rotting fish, mushy kinmeidai, chopped tuna with the texture of goo, etc. On top of that, you have "chefs" who're more keen to make fun of you/ entertain/serve too many people than take proper care of the food. Chunks of raw fish, a box of uni, etc. are left to rot on the counter for 10+ mins before being served (where it's warm as there's a cooking station behind). If you order the 4 kinds of sushi as a main (thankfully we didn't), they take so long to prepare it that the first piece of fish is left on rice, near a fire for a good 20 mins.

We celebrated our 6th anniversary at Teppei. It was our first experience of their omakase dinner menu. Kudos to the service staff for their prompt and polite service throughout the session given the tight space they have..If you are looking for a romantic date, this is not the place as you'll be seated very close to the next customer along the bar counter.But if you are a foodie and loves seeing the prep work before you are served your food! This is the place.When we were given the minced tuna sushi roll, the lady beside me was quite offended when male patrons received a roll double the size of female patrons and mentioned she will not be back again as the restaurant is male chauvinist. I felt a little that way too initially, but I felt quite full even before all the dishes were served. So I guess the restaurant factored in that female appetite is generally smaller than male and this is their way to ensure both gender leave feeling full after the meal.The food were really fresh and yummy and well worth the price

It's out second visit to Teppei, and honestly, we LOVE it. They had a special deal where the omakase was $60++ which is great value! The food was fantastic, and the chef and team are really fantastic - funny, having a good time all while providing great quality. Highly recommend, with friends, family, couple, you won't be disappointed :

Had a $60++ set meal and also celebrated my girlfriend's birthday with friends. One of her friends booked Teppei and requested for something special for the birthday girl. The food was good and some were unexpected. The staff were all very hospitable and friendly, always ready for a good laugh. We were all definitely bloated after the dinner.

Second time visit. My Friend booked 3 months ago. Good experience good food and appx. $100 per person.

Fun night at Teppei's last week when friends got us a table for the first seating of their omakase dinner.Apparently sometimes there's even more going on but there was some spoon feeding, a light show and birthday singing and joking going around for everyone. Other than that the food was really nice with my favorites being the gyu, the unagi, the sashimi and the multitude of snacks and spoon tasters that came around
4
Normally there is a long queue (well seats) of people but on a Saturday we got seated fast. We were not there for omakase but just to order the ala carte dishes. The associates were helpful and responded well to our queries since this is the first time we were there. Eventually we settled on the seafood don. It came with generous servings of sashimi. We were very satisfied. There are also side dishes which the restaurant tops up regularly. Perhaps it varies but we found the combination of daikon and salmon to be really nice.Overall the dining experience was pleasant. If only the seating can be wider since it is all bar counter. And seating outside along the walkway is limited to a few tables. Considering price this is a great place to dine on reasonable budget

I have heard of this place and for a long time had wanted to visit with my husband. However, after hearing about how difficult it was to get a booking, we thought forget it....if we cannot book it, it ain't worth our time...so we thought. Recently,after maybe 2 years having heard of this place, I was led to a reservation site after checking on several Japanese omakase options. Upon seeing the available dates, I was surprised to see a Sat evening 2nd seating slot a week from then - so I thought why not ask my Japanese food enthusiast husband who didn't even have to think but agreed. In order to book, you would need to secure it with a credit card. With the credit card secured, the restaurant will charge USD50 per pax for a no-show. Upon arriving at the booking time of 8:30pm, we were greeted with a crowd outside the restaurant. At the door, there was a notice saying that the 2nd seating would start at 8:40pm. That was a little strange as our booking was for 8:30pm and to have the notice say another timing, was a bit of a put-off. The people from the earlier seating were all still inside not budging. There were also cleaning items like brooms and mops left outside of the restaurant which made me imagine that I was in a queue to get into a cheap roadside cafe....Anyway, the people from the 1st seating finally began to take their leave -phew. I was beginning to think that their buttocks were glued to the chairs but that could just be my growling tummy thinking mean thoughts out loud. The place was small, squeezy and extremely claustrophobic. I had to juggle my handbag on my lap whilst eating. Of all days, I chose a big bag to bring - how silly of me. I thought oh no, I wish I never caved in and booked this place. My husband was more optimistic. Anyway, we were quickly asked for our dietary requirements and whether we would be able to whatever they served. Told them I would not fancy their raw oyster. Thereafter, a quick succession of food was served. There were many served one after another and I must say the dish I enjoyed most was the wagyu beef and the fish w Sakura rice. I have attached some photos of the dishes served. The sashimi didn't look as pretty as those served in higher end Japanese food establishments but the taste and freshness were fine - thank goodness. We ordered 360ml of their house sake to go along with the food. Ice and hot tea are topped up and provided without charge. The oyster turned out to be very good according to hubby and in place of that, I had salmon yakitori - which was soft and juicy. Loved it.The part which I found uncomfortable and weird was when they had to feed us some tiny dishes on spoons. Yes, the server literally had to scoop it into your mouth. He played some pranks on some people (pulling the food away at the last minute with their mouths wide open) and I didn't like that actually as I felt that it was done in bad taste. Good thing he didn't pull the prank on me as I would have thrown the spoon back at him. My hubby thinks was acting a bit diva-ish and that I should just play along and have a good time. He on the other hand was enjoying the whole food and dining experience being fed with a spoon and all despite the cramp conditions.We were then asked what we wanted for our mains and dessert. I chose the unni with fried rice and salted caramel ice cream. My husband chose the wagyu beef rice yuzu ice cream. When the mains arrived, we could only eat up the unni and the wagyu beef and asked the servers to pack up the rice so that it is not wasted. To our pleasant surprise, he took the initiative to add in a whole box of cooked wagyu beef into the rice for us to take home. That was a nice gesture. Overall, I am pleased to report that my initial qualms about the place has gone out of the window. Seeing the brooms and mops outside the restaurant entrance further heightened my apprehension about dining there. However, I am glad that I was proven wrong. The food was good and the experience pleasant except for the feeding with a spoon part. The omakase was $80 per person and so I think it was good value for about 15-18 courses (depending on whether you want to count the fruit sticks each as a course or not). Sake was $25 per 180ml. Would I come back again? Hmm, I would have to say "yes" and I think my enthusiastic husband will echo my sentiments

I have never been treated so badly by a restaurant. I booked for the 8:30pm Omakase menu well in advance, confirmed reservation on the day, showed up on time only to be told to wait outside for half an hour while they prepared the tables. Then at 9pm as we were starving hungry and tired of waiting we were told that they did not have a table for us after all and we should try to come back another day!!! What is the point of having a reservation system if you don't honour your bookings?? I won't be going back

This was my first omakase experience, and I had to see what all the hype was about. Thankfully I managed to get a seat only 1 month in advance (rather than the 3 month waiting time as is popularly said).We had some good quality stuff here, including o-toro, an oyster, lots of uni, some nice grilled fish, and negitoro. However, I felt some of the other things we had were a bit of a letdown. This includes the grilled wagyu beef, which despite being advertised as "Grade A4". was chewy and tough; some random tough steamed fish in the middle of the meal; and the appetisers, which we really could have done without. My wife and I were too stuffed towards the end, to enjoy the final course, and I think that didn't help our experience at all. It felt as if they were trying to squeeze in too many dishes, and I'm not sure if this would compromise on the quality. It definitely contributed to the feeling that we were being rushed through our meal. We could see the chefs speeding through each course, and it felt like neither party had a chance to enjoy what we were doing. I suspect that being the earlier seating (6.30pm to 8.30pm) put us at a disadvantage as perhaps the staff wanted to usher us out asap so that they could prepare for the next seating.But I guess, for $94 per pax, maybe we shouldn't expect too much? There was some good stuff, just that the overall experience could ha

They are famous with their omakase menu and also known as the worth price omakase in Singapore. Their food is not very surprising, perhaps for your first time experince its quite enjoying. I went there with my boyfriend and is his birthday. I have make this reservation a month earlier if I am not wrong, and their reservation only can be confirmed through web (its hard to book! and mostly full!). I even made a request that to arrange a birthday celebration. Overall, the experience was good. Just that upon entering the restaurant, they did mentioned about the birthday celebration whereby I want it to be a surprise! But luckily my boyfriend didnt heard of it. And during the mid of the meal, they come and ask me again about the birthday celebration. Oh my god, I thought i had make a clear statement that this is a surprise? And your shop only accomodates around 20pax, i will suggest that you should have make some special indication for your later preparation instead. This omakase meal last for 2 hours (sharp). The server try hard to make their guests happy, alot of cold gag they made. Some staff are cute anyway. Lastly the birthday celebration is cool. Its the funniest moment for the night. I had a good dinner there. Will definitely coming back for a special occasion
5
Restaurant is cozy and at best can seat 24 persons. Every dish prepared is in full view of diners. Servers and chefs are friendly and at times playful! Nice touches to create environment of cheekiness. Food served were aplenty, 12-13 courses all in all for $94 per pax after taxes. Quite value for money if you ask me given Omakase dining. Some may feel uneasy as items prepared like sushi were using bare hands without gloves but I'm totally fine with it. Make sure you reserve seats by calling or via online as all if not most evenings are always crowded

We have heard much about Teppei at Orchid Hotel so finally decided to give it a try after getting a dinner slot at 830 pm for 3. While writing this, I did wonder how this restaurant got their positive feedback. Was it because of the 'fun/playful?' novelty of feeding guests individually from stainless steel spoons (3 in succession was a little too much to handle), by pasting sliced beef on metal trays with the name 'Teppei' on it and inviting guests by passing it round to take pictures, the playful exchanges or the quantity/varieties of food given, that made people forget and overlook the basic idea of good Japanese 'omakase' where, the ingredients and the pride of the chef are displayed that are usually aimed at pleasing the diners six senses. Here, the local staff did all the work the whole night but the Japanese boss was at the takeaway counter which I thought was strange.Don't get me wrong. For $80, you get pretty much a bit of everything but the everything is just sheer number of items some of which I did not eat because I was taken aback by the handling of food by different serving staff. Everything was on 'choo-choo' mode, fast and quick. The raw handling of the some of the sushi from the chef and passed on to the serving staff by hand (she was busy doing other things as well before handling the food) is something I just can't stomach. We spent about $340 including 2 small portions of sake for three. As I said, it's not the cost, but an experience I could not forget. Frankly, we had to decline many of the food politely by saying we are full.Of course, the above is written based on the experience I had at Teppei.'Omakase' love

We brought our kids to celebrate the elders Birthday. They had Omakase And i have to say the varieties are a lot for $80 per pax. As it's my sons birthday , they swop the sashimi rice with a sashimi cake. My kids totally enjoyed the dinner.
3
Good enough to have tempura set for lunch. Crowded. Small space. Long queue. Average service. Price is reasonable.
4
Brought my in laws here to celebrate a birthday :) i enjoyed the variety of food, seriously it's a lot! however, it's very systematic maybe because it happens like that every night and towards the end, i felt a little rush. nonetheless i think it's good value for money

While many reviews have very good feedback, I am not too sure what benchmark was used. For $80 (before tax) meal, the quality is not up to its price standard. If you want to go for many many dishes (about 15-16), then I think it is worth from that stand point. Starter was too ordinary, Raw Fish was not that fresh, not sure if it is due to my dinner being round 2. Servers are not too trained to introduce the dishes, which is a basic for omakase meal. If not, I won't know what I'm eating. However, for Japanese's omakase meal, I would expect quality over quantity. For just a slightly higher price ($130), I can get extremely high quality and also seasonal Japanese omakase meal.Cons: - Definitely smell after your meal. - Raw cuts don't feel too fresh to me, not sure if it is because I was round 2 for dinner.- Does not provide the Quality feel of a omakase mealPros:- Fun loving place; changes the perception that omakase have to be "high class"- Quantity Meal; many dishes- Food are rated average to above average; so everything is acceptable.

First visit was at least 2-3 years ago before Teppei's ambitious expansion. The food was outstanding and value for money. Went back to Teppei a couple of times this year to try their signature barachirashi, with the last visit in Oct. I must say the standard of the food have dropped by at least 50%. The rice was not well cooked, once it was too hard and Oct was too mushy. The sashimi was also not well marinated and come across as too dry. The queue for Teppei is also gone during lunch time and the reason is obvious. Their less experienced chefs are serving you their signature dish but the price has gone up.
5
Ever since I visited Japan I've been longing to find something equivalent to the food I had there. Sadly I've been to many Japanese restaurants, even high class ones and nothing was up to scratch until I stumbled upon Teppei. I'm writing this review now but I've been patronizing them for over 3 years. I read some crap reviews here which is why I decided to write one, but don't take my word for it just go down and see the lunchtime queues for yourself. Can't be that bad if people bother to queue for half an hour can it? Anyway back to the food. The idea of putting raw fish in a bowl is not rocket science but the quality of the fish is something else. I've never had bad fish in this restaurant. And the sauce. Man. I called it my opium sauce. Don't know what is in it but it complements the fish really well. For 18 bucks a bowl this is an absolute gem. And despite all his success you can still find Teppei San working there in the afternoons and evenings serving his diners with a warm smile.

Sadly overrated, lacking in finesse, ambience, decor and food quality. As my wife puts it, it's like eating in a stuffy canteen with barely 2 feet wide to dine in. No explanation of what was served (unless asked). For $80, go to Ritz Carlton's dinner buffet ($78) or Hokkaido Sushi Restaurant at M hotel for about $50.If you enjoy eating in cramped, stuffy places and being served ONE ginko nut, ONE grape and ONE small slice of mango on a stick in between dishes, this place is for you.To be fair, the servers made an effort and were friendly. Some of the dishes were decent but none outstanding (the crab legs certainly weren't fresh).I think that this place is suffering from owners obsessed by profit. Sad. First and last time for me
5
I have lunch here once every two weeks for the past 2 years - I once came four days in a row because my boyfriend is obsessed with the place. The barachirashi is great - it's basically sashimi served with their special soy sauce in huge cubes over Japanese rice. Extremely friendly and lovely staff who joke around with us and greet us warmly when we enter. Cannot recommend this place enough

I heard so much about the restaurant because of the famous 'waiting period' before one gets a seat so when they automated the booking system, I quickly jump in to ballot for a seat & I got it! Today's the day & I just finished my dinner as I am writing my review. Overall, even though the restaurant is very small, all the staff are very friendly. The boss is hospitable & experienced. Food is fantastic! I love it & I feel it's very value for money. We were all offered extra desserts at the end but most rejected as we were simply too FULL! I highly recommend this restaurant but bear in mind that you need to check out their Facebook page for the reservation details. In sum, always book 1 month ahead of the date that you want to go. Enjoy

It took a while but finally after many attempts at booking we finally got a place at teppei for dinner. So - was it worth it ? In a word - yes. Is it the best Japanese food in town ? No. Is it the best value ? Yes. Omakase meal where you can let them know if you have dietary restrictions. Without giving too much away, it's a fun experience with plenty of food. In fact the drinks cost more than the food ($80 per person for dinner ). Booking is tough and you need to book once they open the booking for the next 2 months (if I recall ). Sometimes you can get a last minute booking if someone cancels (Facebook). I'll be going again - in fact this good review will just make it harder to book - oh well it's deserved.

The fun of Teppei was Teppei himself. As the business expanded the food and service suffered.I used to love to order the birthday cake - it is actually a big order of Barasushi for takeaway. It used to be made fresh - but not anymore. You end up with dry rice and not so fresh tasting fish masked with lots of soya sauce. The individual bowl barasushi used to be good but standards have dropped and it is usually over sauced so it is very salty!I loved the show and tell of a Teppei Omakase and it was always exciting to be able to get a booking. As they got popular they got really cocky about the reservations- you couldn't call at any time - the bookings were months in advance (which usually ended up with last min cancellations as people tended to forget). I could have put up with the attitude if the food remained good. So not the case!Spend your money elsewhere

A friend enjoyed Omakase dinner here and raved about it, so after waiting for two months, we had dinner there.The restaurant was run by a group of younger chefs. They were friendly and love to joke around so if you prefer the formal Japanese style, then this place is not for you.Omakase dinner comprises of around 20 dishes and came to $94 per person. It was very cheap, the sashimi used were decent, but the Uni could be better.I wouldn't rave about this to anyone, Teppei-san was not around, his crew ran the show. Food served were average, and we all sat around the bar, so nothing spectacular.It is the cheapest Omakase dinner meal that I have ever eaten, with average food quality. Service was prompt but the environment is tight and crowded.If you wanna enjoy great food, you are in the wrong place. However, if you are hungry and feel like Omakase, this is value for money at just 94 bucks, because it is guaranteed to give you a full tummy

Teppei has been a long time favorite and continues to be the undisputed #1 in its category. With a limited fixed menu for lunch accompanied by an assortment of "daily specials" chef Yamashita-san creates magic in that tiny shop everyday.As usual I called for the Barachirashi Don. I was informed of the daily specials - Grilled Eel and fresh Oysters. Both were promptly ordered as well. All three dishes were of the highest quality standard, freshly prepared in front of my eyes. It is a delight to watch chef Yamashita-san and his staff work their stuff behind the counter.I left soon, a completely satisfied man

Two words to describe this place , BEST OMAKASE! The long wait list is definitely worth it. Quality cuisine and decently cheap I must say as compared to many Omakase in Singapore . Almost 20 servings of delicacies in total, needless to say more isn't it. It's a great experience and for a foodie like me, will be there monthly if I got the time. My team and I had a great time and everyone walked out with that satisfying grin from ear to ear. Thumbs up for Teppei San and his team of great crew. Nicely liase by Sharon for the evening , thank you for that. Cya real soon Teppei

Omakase. No need to think what to order. Average cost including tax $100 per person.The arrangement is to eat by the counter. Need to book 3 months in advance to get a seat but sometimes they will release last minute seats up for grab. Just make sure you follow teppei in FB
4
not sure why, but the quality seems to have dropped compared to the past 4 times I have went, their chara barashi still taste as awesome, however when I went down this time, their sides doesnt pack as much of a punch, it used to be really flavorful, something that you would go for more, rounds after rounds. however i do like the main chef for his sensitivity to his customers, as I placed my empty miso soup bowl on the counter, the front staff did not notice it for the first 4 to 5 minutes, which later the owner, help me make a refill afterwards when he finishes he charabarashi batch. the staff seems tired? probably due to the peak hours

Don't get me wrong. The food is great. For the amount of money you pay (S$80), it is totally worth the money. I was told that you need to make reservation like 3 months ahead to get seats. I dont know how my friend did it, but we managed to squeeze in last minute when I visited Singapore last week. We were the last two to arrive in the second seating of dinner omakase. Seats are so cramped I cant move or turn my shoulder literally. But luckily the staffs were very friendly, if not I guess I would have just walked out the door.Appetiser, sashimi, uni fried rice, tuna, snapper soup etc etc.. I think we have gotten much more than what we have paid for. One complaint I guess would be that the food is served in such a hurry that we don't get proper explanation to what we are eating. I think I'm a little disappointed as I've heard such good reviews from my friends previously. I think I would pay a little premium to go for a much proper omakase next time

This is a small and cramp Japanese eatery at Orchid Hotel just a mere 3 mins walk from Tanjong Pagar mrt. They are famous for their raw fish don - Chirashi son and have daily specials for interesting variations of this dish. The truffle soy sauce version I tried was very delicious and had interesting texture with each mouthful. Be warned the serving is meant for ladies,really small eaters will find it alright. For guys you might want to order 2 servings. For $19.80 for the lunch special it was well worth it. It comes with sides of miso soup, fish stew and a mug of tea.

Started with 1) assorted platter of 6 appetiser2) assorted sashimi 5pieces3) chawanmushi seaweed & tofu4) negitoro with ikura seaweed wrap maki5) foie gras, beef & ikura on spoon6) sweet potato skewer7) deep fried fish8) edamame & wasabi mash9) eggplant unagi10) sashimi scallops wings11) tuna cheese crackers12) grilled wagyu beef13) crab soup14) sashimi rice - nigiri sushi15) green tea or yuzu ice creamIt was a nice experience looking at the executive chef preparing the dishes, the servers will actually feed the guest with appetisers served in the spoon. Its kind of entertaining, the staff will also organise a so called birthday cake made out of sashimi rice to celebrate guest birthdayThe restaurant can improve in having a better interior on the open air kitchen. The place is slightly old. Definitely an experience that you should try at least 1 time.

Because my husband and I have been really inspired by the Japanese culinary documentary we've fell in-love with, we went into searching best Japanese Restaurants in Singapore. We then stumble not only one of the bests but also found our way to enjoy our first Omasake Dining experience! Our overall impression with Teppei is something we'll always remember. We've had 15 course meal. Out of this, diners are only allowed to choose main and dessert from the menu. Rests of the food, chef decides. Along the preparation and serving, there were some jokes thrown to us. Not the best jokes but kudos to the entire staff because they made us all laugh. The atmosphere was warm from beginning till the end. Also, everything is synchronised, which is once again another reason why am all hands up Teppei!!! Thanks for the great introduction to Omasake!!! Btw, A La Carte is serve over lunch, too :

For photos of all the courses and more reviews, visit hungrybaker.coThe popular Teppei serves only omakase in a small restaurant space at Orchid Hotel. The open kitchen takes up the bulk of the space and diners sit around a counter where they can watch the chefs at work. Omakase means the chef chooses what to serve, taking into account what the diners cannot eat. At Teppei, however, you get to choose a main course which includes its famous chirashi don (also available on its own at other Teppei outlets, such as Teppei Syokudo), uni fried rice, aburi sushi (looked amazing, will try this next time), beef atop fried rice and fish ochazuke (rice in tea). You also get to choose an ice cream for dessert (not made in-house, flavours include durian, calpis and yuzu).I went in a group of four and one of us does not eat seafood, except raw salmon, while the other does not eat beef, lamb, pork and wheat. Teppei kindly accommodated us, replacing items such as seared beef with seared fatty tuna, and little bites with slices of the juicy and sweetest strawberry and tomato I have eaten. It is hard to find such good produce that pack such a powerful punch.Although I did not eat certain things – such as those containing flour or the amazing-looking beef that was cooked to perfection – I found the experience and food worth the money (about S$80+). We ate about 20 items (including small bites in between courses) and emerged stuffed to the gills and happy.But a simple barachirashi from one of the Teppei outlets would be better for smaller eaters (

Omakase. Translated as "I'll leave it up to you." Is an experience quite unique to Japanese restaurants which is to let the chef decide what you will be eating. And in Singapore, Teppei restaurant is probably the best omakase experience that one can get. I was fed so many things last night that I lost count how many courses I had (but the count is 18 so far) this included the many "Aaah"s that we open our mouth to spoonful of awesomeness. Teppei-San also cheekily play around with food by giving you (heavily) wasabi-filled items or removing the spoon just as you close your mouth (expecting goodness). It's an amazing experience and one I would recommend for indulgence every once in a long long while
5
Just absolutely amazing authentic Japanese food served with top-notch quality and service! I can eat here everyday!! The staff are friendly and the sashimi are fresh. The place is clean and cozy and the sake, OMG! out of this world!!! The chef will cook and serve and make eye contact with Each Customer! It's unbelievable!! I went back three times within 2 weeks! We enjoyed every moment of watching the chefs cook with such finesse as much as savoring every bit of the dishes. And if and when you managed to get a reservation for their Omakase dinner, you'll be in for an adventure of your lifetime! The food is top notch and he presentation is PLAYFUL! Be ready to have fun!!

My last review was a rave review for Teppei. After almost 2 years of waiting, we finally secured another reservation for New Years Eve! I was very excited to have secured this reservation and to share the Teppei experience with my husband.While the ambience was great and the food still interesting we did have the feeling that it was now just one big production line... Food was served to the patrons rather than served to observe, taste and enjoy. Having a young baby, while it was interesting and certainly funny to be hand fed from a spoon as an adult, as it was done repeatedly I had the feeling that this was so I would not notice the changed quality of the food.White wine was served straight from the shelf. We had to request for it to be chilled.As it was my first glass in almost two years it was a little disappointing. The team were as always fantastic - engaging and entertaining. Overall it was a "fun" evening but not quite the El Bulli experience that I was expecting from my last visit.The draw card is clearly the "nightclub" style marketing techniques for a booking.My husband remarked that he did not know what all the fuss was about. "fun experience but average food"... unfortunately not the Teppei I remembered from my first visit.We know the chef and his team clearly has the talent and the capabilities! They may want to rethink their strategy
5
Heard a lot about this place. Managed to get a seat for the Omakase dinner. We were totally impressed! Food is good, service amazing and overall fun and fulfilling. The seat is a bit uncomfortable but the overall experience is still great! Come and be entertained by Master Teppei
5
Been here TONS of times! So much so i actually am in the front of the queue most of the time for lunch. Their barachirashi don,the signature lunch dish, is under 20 bucks. Adding stuff like Uni or Negitoro would be an additional 8 bucks. There also also specials (higawari) which change everyday. Tuesdays would be the fresh chutoro don which i had recently! AMAZING
5
It's a casual Omakase dinner worth a visit, not the normal spacious dining experience, patrons are seated probably 2cm apart from each other. My Husband booked 2 cancellation slots from their Facebook page, it was an unprepared dinner date so there was no expectations. Love the intimate treatment from servers to dinners, during the whole 18course dinner the Chef had food on their spoons and fed us across the counter seats. Among the courses, the sushi platter ranks the top. Had tried their dinner, will be back to try their lunch. =}

I'm not sure why everyone is raving about this restaurant. I was so excited that I got a reservation and was really looking forward to affordable authentic Japanese in Singapore, but it was a letdown! My partner and I both agreed that we would much rather spend 3-4x the price on omakase after having Teppei. The food was very mediocre, and we didn't get any nigiri's sadly (yes, I know it's up to the chef but I'm used to the mountain of sushi's we get in Tokyo). I know it's cheap, but for the quality of food we got, we really wonder why the reviews are this good. We'd rather just head to Itacho if we are looking at a similar price range. I also didn't enjoy having the cleaning lady stick her hands out each time we were done with a dish (what I mean is, she would put her hands out for us to pass her the empty plates)
5
their omakase dinner is one of the best jap meals I had in Singapore. the food prepared for the diners are always oozing with class and quality. for the price, the quality and variety they can come up with is incredible. and they change up some of their menu every other month. so it's always refreshing to come back again to see what they can serve up. worth the effort to book this restaurant! lunch menu does not disappoint at all too! their bara chirashi is da bomb! have to try!
5
My first impression of the restaurant was disappointing as I kinda of expect a more fancy looking place. But i came with an open mind and since food is the main focus. I was not disappointed at all. Everything was very good quality .. sushi simply melt in the mouth. and they even had foie gras which just nicely seared and melting soft. Words just can't describe the whole experience of dining there. The Yuzu ice cream was the perfect ending to a unique meal.I read in the previous review of their bad service. Not at all. My partner and I find they were extremely nice and funny and really try to make everybody happy.The restaurant is bit cramped but if you want to experience a bit of Japanese dining style
4
Came here to try the Omakase dinner recently (attracted by the very reasonable prices, at $80++ per head, and the sheer difficulty of securing a reservation). The food is decent but certainly isn't world class (and it's clear that you're not in a $200 a head place), but the chefs go to a lot of effort to make the evening interesting. It's definitely worth a visit, and I would probably go again if it weren't so complex to get a booking here. Sake is fairly expensive but hey this is Singapore after all. The dinner was certainly much better than lunch
3
I must say the service is very good. Maybe the many courses of omakase made this meal value for money.
The Food was OK.
5
Great dinner....omakase. The whole dinning experience is so homely. Super service & wonderful food.. The best in Singapore. Chef Teppei-San's cooking is simple, and creative. 10/10. Oishii.....
5
An excellent restaurant that serves value for money but high quality and fresh and exotic tasting omakase sets. Friendly and humorous chefs working round the clock to prepare a delicious meal for their customers.
4
Went on separate occasion. Tried kaisen don and seared salmon sashimi don. Both were really awesome. And priced around $16-$20. It's really value for money.
5
Finally got to tried their omakase. The team, as usual, is super friendly and welcoming. As a whole I only really liked their aburi sushi at the end. The rest were average, although getting to try crocodile toes (?) was a novelty! Got another chance to have the omakase but declined ...Much more enjoyable for me is their lunch. I go back several times with barachirashi as the outside option, willing to take on the special of the day if it intrigues. This is a very good outside option as Barachirashi here is quite probably my favourite way to spend $16.90 (or less) for lunch (anywhere)
5
My wife and I love taking out from Teppei'a Takashimaya and Millenia Walk outlets.At an above-average price, the Kaisendon offers a generous amount of chirashi of different types of fish. Even the eggs come in abundance!Well done to the team that never fall short of quality
4
Went for lunch today. Get there early (11:30) to be sure of getting seated. Don't be put off by the queue. Well worth the wait. Not the most aesthetically pleasing place on the inside, and rather cramped, but the food is great. Can thoroughly recommend the sashimi and the tempura. And amazing value too
3
Since they will serve you 18 course Omakase meal, and some of them will be puffed rice and just a tomato on a toothpick, dont be disappointed yet. Cause you will end up liking atleast something from amongst the so many options. Since food is served laboriously over a period of more than 2 hours, and u sit on a bar stool, it can hurt your back. The Sake is very good (choose the cheaper one). The staff/chef interaction is the best part of the experience, as they keep having fun. It will set you back by 150$ (food + alcohol) - and maybe since u get a table after a long wait of 2-3 months, and you are dying to post the photos online, you may forget, that there are many other Japanese restaurants where you can eat equally good food at this price, if not better
4
This place has really great barachirashi that is fresh and flavourful. The staff were friendly too. However, I personally feel its not worth the wait and you can get a decent barachirashi of the same quality elsewhere without the queuing. Nevertheless, the prices are affordable and the fact that chefs are friendly and speak to customers make the experience special
4
while the omakase is almost impossible to get, unless you have the fastest fingers, or know someone, but try your luck nonetheless. It is truly the best for how much you pay for it. teppei-san also occasionally surprises you with an uncommon dish! Otherwise, drop in for dinners or lunches. Do note that the restaurant next to Teppei, HanaHana serves set dinners and teppei set lunches as well! Counter seats only, so if you are going in a big group, expect to shout. Do not expect a romantic 2 pax dinner occasion as most diners are a little noisy as the chefs chat with the customers as well. Great ambiance if you ask me
4
Reasonable prices Omakase dinner set but so hard to book for seats. Need to make booking 3 months ahead or wait for last mins seats. But value for money and great sushi counter experience!
4
We went first time in this restaurant my wife n I feel very good. We celebrate my birthday and they made very good. Good food and service
5
Good food and balue for money but it's very difficult to book as it has only 22 seats. Try drop by and they might have last min cancelation.
4
A 22 seater restaurant serving 2 seating. Good foods serving about 8 to 10 small courses.value for money as it charges for a Japanese meal.Very difficult to book,should have a better booking system.
5
We have been coming to Teppei since it first opened and have enjoyed both the lunches and the dinners. We alternative between the special of the day and the barachirashi which are consistently great. It's still true however that the best food is still prepared by Teppei-san. The que is a pain but the food makes up for it and the prices are incredibly reasonable
5
This is my comfort food. Teppei-san's generosity with the sashimi in the bara chirashi makes me always end up finish eating the rice before all the sashimi. The variety of sashimi in this bowl is amazing too. On top of the usual tuna, tuna belly, salmon, salmon belly, yellowtail, sometimes you get even get akagai and scallops.The sauce is heavenly and the free flow of side dishes is a sweet touch after being hungry from the queue.The only downside is the queue, but you can always try to make the non-peak when office crowd isn't out. Turnover is high anyway so you won't have much trouble securing a seat, max wait maybe 1h!See you soon Teppei-san
2
Went for a dinner at Teppei with a group of friends after work. I heard so much about how difficult to book this restaurant. My friend booked the restaurant, only managed to get the 6.30pm seating. The other seating is t 8.30pm (even on a weekdays). The restaurant was packed, with the 22 customers almost rubbing shoulder with each others. We opted for the $80 menu. There was a lot of food! From 1st dish to the last dish, the dishes keep on coming. Unfortunately, the food was very mediocre. Also, they have to rush through so that the next group of diners can be seated by 8.30pm. At the end of the dinner, I could only remember the bottle of sake that I ordered. So, go there if you're really hungry but don't expert any wow factor from any of the dishes
3
I've been to Teppei for dinner twice in less than a year. Both times through the grace of people who pulled out of their bookings. Although I paid for my own meal. There are some fans who book a place every month. Apparently it takes about a 6 month wait now. You pay about $100 per pax.Come on time. Go for the second seating so you don't feel so rushed. The experience is fun, place crowded, rustic and ingredients are unique. He gives out lollipop peach tomatoes freshly imported from Japan. Seasonal baby crabs served on a stick. The crowd is young and hip. I wonder how matured their taste buds are. Having said that, friends in their 60s absolutely loved this place, as they're probably as experimental in their food choices as their daughters and very good cooks at that.First time I thought I was too judgmental. So second time, I grudgingly said yes on a Saturday as a replacement. Friends who brought me thought they were doing me a big favour. Striking the lottery without the 6 mth wait. Again I parted with another $100. I told my husband, not the third time. Singapore has so many excellent restaurants and I'll leave my space for the fans who queue every month. The owner chef is Japanese so his ingredients are uniquely sourced. He ensures you'll be full. Opt for the sushi rice on spoons at the end. Even though garlic rice as option is good too, you're probably too full for that. Go once so you'll know what people are talking about. But you're not striking lottery.
5
I was first brought here by a colleague, and now I visit them at least once a week for my barachirashi fix.At $17.60 inclusive of freeflow side dishes; this is probably the best value chirashi in town. The chunks of sashimi are generous and always very fresh. When i try to recreate the chirashi at home, it doesn't hold a candle to the beautifully marinated sashimi and perfectly cooked fluffy japanese rice. The fact that real wasabi is used (not the crappy horseradish type you get in japanese chain store) ups the flavor ante more.Easily my favorite place to get my Japanese treat fix
5
Teppei is a small resturant, with maximum 22 seats per time. It has two seating per night. The omakase is the best I ever had. The sashimi was fresh, and the tuna belly is so so good. Priced at 60 or 80 dollars, it sounds on the expensive side but it is price worthy. In a counter seating side, we could interact with the chef. He is so funny and brings lots of joy to the dining experience. Expensive but surely worth going. Dont mind going again again
5
Smiling chef that makes you feel like he could be your BFF. Great affordable omakase that makes you full n contented. Over the years. Chef teppei and his team has always tried to accomadate people when they could. Issue if you need to get a seat. If not go to next door Hana Hana and order ala carte
3
I have been curious to try this place for a long time but have always been out off by the ridiculous lines at lunchtime and the 3 month waiting list for dinner. My lunch companion very kindly offered to line up at 11:15 today and I joined shortly before opening at 11:45. I was a little disappointed with the tempura wagyu which I chose: the tempura prawns looked much better. Prices are very reasonable but I felt the quality was average. I'd still like to try the omakase dinner if I can be patient enough to book so far in advance
4
Teppi has been taking Singapore by storm recently and after months of waiting finally got the chance to savor Japanese omakase at such an affordable price. Having as many as 22 items for $80, it is quite worthed it and you'd probably be wowed. Read my full review @ http://shauneeie.blogspot.sg/2014/11/teppei-tanjong-pagar.htm

Had lunch with friends on a Saturday. We started queuing at about 11.30am for the first seating. I may go for the second seating at around 1pm for my next visit, as I realised the queue was short.I had the barachirashi set. On top of the cold green tea and miso soup, there are free flow of side dishes (3 types) for customers to share. The stewed daikon was so good
4
Got there at 1.30pm on a Saturday, there wasn't much of a queue, we didn't have to wait for long before we were seated. Tried the Barachirashi set (assorted sashimi with rice) and the Wagyu beef Higawari, SGD14.95 each. Both came with cold green tea, miso soup, two vege side dishes, and deep fried fish skin & bones, all refillable.Their famous Barachirashi is yummy, but I think the ingredients especially the Ikura can be fresher. Still worth the money, though not worth queuing up for more than 15 minutes. Sitting beside me was a Japanese lady who frequents the place for the Barachirashi every week. So I guess it says something.The pan seared Wagyu beef tastes nice, but is overcooked. We should've mentioned to the chef that medium rare is preferred. I like the vegetable stew side dish.I would come back again to have the Barachirashi set for lunch, it was a pleasant experience and the food is of good value
5
I was on my business trip back then in 2012 when my cousin brought me to Teppei restaurant claiming that it's one of the best in Spore.He knows that I love sashimi!Although the restaurant is small, somehow it gave me a very comfortable experience as I could see how the chefs moved around the open kitchen so fast and yet abled to serve an excellent Japanese food nicely presented.The beef slices (Forgotten the name) was so juicy and delicious served with yuzu wasabi sauce...speechless! The sashimi platter was so fresh that it melted in my mouth straightaway. I could still remembered the taste until now. The salmon roe rice was another winner! It tasted so good that even though I was full, I could still finished up the whole bowl of it. Can imagine how nice it was.Now it is 2014 and I still miss the food there. Heard from my cousin that we have to make the reservations months in advance. I shall definitely revisit them again
4
We had the $80 omakase dinner and boy was it an experience! Each item was so thoughtfully prepared and served at a very comfortable pace. There were a few items that we would never have ordered or tried on our own - like the fried rooster's crown which turned out to be pretty good. Sashimi was very fresh and the fatty tuna and salmon were likely one of the best I've ever had (including even Sapporo). The only downside is that reservations are a challenge as the restaurant only seats 20 (?) and must be made months ahead. Teppei is also not a place for a romantic dinner or quiet chats. The restaurant is rather warm and customers are seated pretty close together (think crowded ramen joints in Tokyo). Having said that I would gladly revisit if the reservation queue wasn't so long. If you haven't already visited, you must
5
Having a 2-hour Omakase at Teppei is like a journey. The chef prepared food after food throughout the 2-hour that will guarantee you to come out with full stomach. The experience is like watching a 2 hour movie with suspense....what is the chef serving next? is it as good as the meal before (the answer is most likely, yes)?For the price, it is the best valued omakase meal.I can't wait to go back but the restaurant is fully booked for a long, long time! That is the downside....Teppei withdrawal after the great dinner..
4
Pretty good Omakase! Ranging from $50 $60 $80 for 10 to 12 course. The pictures say it all.All in all a great experience, good quality food in a nice atmosphere for a decent priceThe restaurant was hot and the air con was not sufficien

I heard about this Japanese restaurant from an overseas Japanese friend living in London. That's how good the reputation of this place is. However, after making several failed attempts to make a reservation, I forgot all about the restaurant until my colleague brought me to her "favourite restaurant which she is addicted to" for lunch. To my pleasant surprise, it turned out to be Teppei and the lunch queue (we went about 1pm) was only about 10minutes. We had a seat at the counter and service was very prompt. There were free flowing appetizers which really good but I was really impressed with my excellent mix raw seafood bowl. I must admit it was one of the best that I have ever tried in my life (I have been to Japan 21 times).In terms of ambience, it is definitely not a place for romantic or quiet dinners as diners have to seat very close to each other at the counter. The restaurant itself is very narrow and crowded.The prices of food are reasonable and affordable.I would definitely return for the excellent food
3
Many patrons have only one item in mind on the menu: Bara set or rather a Mix Raw Seafood bowl which is not only generous and quite fresh. The Sea Eel Tempura Set may be a little tricky as the fryer was a part time young boy cook who got it all wrong. Expect to wait at least 45 minutes as the shop seating space is limited. They have a bigger outlet literally around the corner on the 2nd floor although the smell and atmosphere are not as good as the ground floor shop. According to some regulars, the portions have shrunk and yes on the second visit, they even forgot to put in the salmon roe which improves the taste and texture of the rice. Actually, one could even have the same set called Kaisen Don in Tsukiji for less money and better ingredients, except the place makes it up by offering 4 side dishes. One of the more honest Japanese eateries that offers acceptable standards of food and service
5
If you want to experience Teppei without the months-long reservations, then you should try it out for lunch. The queue starts forming as early as 11:30-11:40, so come in early. The tables are arrayed around the Japanese chefs who prepare the food right in front of you. I love love love their bara chirashi (which isn't found in the menu). It's usually worth it to order the special for the day. The food that's advertised on their menu is usually just the tempura (which is really good as well). The restaurant can only seat around 20 a serving, so if you're not part of the first 20 in the queue, then be prepared to wait for however long it takes for their meals to finish. When you're seated around the table, the cold tea is unlimited, as are the sides. If you're not careful, you might get full just because of the sides around you! And you shouldn't, so make sure to go for whatever you've ordered, because I can guarantee that it's of very high quality!It has a very Japanese feeling inside, and the smallness of the restaurant gives it a good cozy feel, while giving you a great view of the chefs preparing your food. Absolutely wonderful, I went to Teppei 4 times in 2 weeks back when I had time to do it. I would go back again if I had time. Highly recommended
5
We booked Teppei in October 2013 for a March 17 2014 reservation. In fact i'd almost forgotten we had the booking it took that long. All I can say is, it was definitely worth the wait. It's simply about the quality of the food. No flash gimmicks or over the top tableware its very rustic and simple and the chef just lets the food and ingredients do the talking. Yellow Fin Tuna with Sesame, Cripsy sushi roll and Wagyu Beef were definitely the highlights although we had around 16 different dishes and each one was a taste sensation. My only regret, is if I want to go back i'll have to wait another 6 months + for a seat
3
So I heard this reservation is very difficult to score and I was invited by friends to come. Part of the reason for the wait is that this place only seats 20 max along the sushi counter , and that's a very uncomfortable shoulder to shoulder. We got the 630pm seating and it's for 2 hours. The 830pm seating folks usually have to wait till 9 or 915pm for their seatingThe first few appetizers were pedestrian, and almost not worth all this buzz. A lame salad, 1 seemingly reheated squid ball etc. The sashimi was ok. The wagyu beef was overcooked but still tasted ok. Their special "sashimi rice" was 4 sushi (tuna, uni, squid, ?) served on 4 metal spoons. Not impressive, and there's a reason we don't eat sushi with a metal spoon, you taste the aluminiumHalfway through the meal, you realise you are sweating buckets. So close to the stove, poor ventilation, and sitting shoulder to shoulder does that to youThere's also a lot of fillers which don't seem to do anything. A "baby yam" that is 5mm served on a stick, huh?Dessert was ice cream of your choice and I found myself swallowing it in seconds. Because it was so damn hot in here. And later when I got home and needed to drink a litre of ice water, I realised the food was too saltySome of my friends love this place and the food, and apparently some reviewers too, and the people waiting outside at 915pm to get in, but this place doesn't do it for m

Called abt 4-5 months ago and was given 15 dec 830 pm slot. Was thinking of skipping it but was glad we didn't. The food was amazing and many dishes surprises us and was glad we ordered the 60 set. Was told by a friend that occasionally there is a 80 set but when we asked last night, the waitress said not available. Wasn't expecting to be wowed by the 60 meal but boy was I wrong! The first few appetizers were fine but not that amazing. But the sashimi was fresh and generous. They even serve fresh wasabi. Many interesting snacks were given along the way. Popped rice, baby yam, smoked radish etc. the hand roll with the fish paste with crispy tempura batter was simply delicious. We even had wagyu beef, uni with rice, Hokkaido crab legs in the 60 set. I really enjoyed the meal And will go back for more meals if I can get a seat!

Enjoyed the $80 menu in a group of 12 and were served over 20 dishes ranging from sashimi, wagyu, popped wild corn, salads and many combinations of both. After a dozen of the delicacies my tummy was reaching its limit. After the last course I was over full. Finishing off with the Sashimi/rice and then the green tea ice cream was a final wow-wow.The restaurant itself is nothing special with an open kitchen surrounded by the bench style dining area. The chefs are professional and even authorised to serve puffer fish (the only course I refused).Our group had booked several weeks ahead and enjoyed the 6.30 sitting (otherwise 8.30).Certainly different, friendly professional staff and a bit of fun. Probably not for the serious Japanese food lover but our Singaporean/English/Japanese group loved it.Would certainly go again

Was served $50 set menu per person. Small portions 8 course snack size meal. The fish is nice however the rest is adequate quality. The service was not up to standard however the Japanese chef is friendly and professional. That time the wait was 1 month. We went twice and for the second visit we found out that the ala carte is better suited for us.

Line up at around 1045 for a guaranteed first seating during lunch hours. Place is a hole in wall that is why it fils up right away. no tables inside just counter seating and chef teppei front and center preparing your lunch. Order the lunch special it differs from day to day. They also have set boxes.A must do when you are in singapore. Fortunately for the ramen place besides teppei they get all the overflows. Ramen is also quite good

It seats only 20 people maximum and you likely have to book 4 months ahead. They have 2 seating, 1 at 6.30pm and the other at 8.30pm. The food is great. Service is a little hurried if you are in the first seating. Very small and smoky, with an open kitchen, its casual and non pretentious. Portions are small but you should be full by the time the rice/noodle comes. They serve omakase between $50 and $80 so its very reasonable. Best for couples because its counter seating so conversation is challenging. All said and done, its like you are in some cozy joint in Tokyo

For full reviews and pictures, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatTeppei and its Japanese Omakase experience is taking Singapore by storm. If you think that the rumored 2-4 weeks wait for a table is long, you would be in for a shock because they are actually full for the rest of the year. That was when i called in... May? Well... the trick to getting a table is to just put your name on the wait list first, and call them a couple of days before to check if people have canceled their reservation. Well, at least that's how i managed to sample the 13-15 course meal for a steal at 60 bucks! There is also a $50 omakase option that excludes the Wagyu beef and Toro. Needless to say we chose the more expensive option.Love the coziness of the bar setting at Teppei. I love watching my food being prepared. It's great entertainment and there's always this anticipation of the next dish.Some highlights-Rice roll with a minced fish paste that was mixed with tempura batter to give it that light crunch. I'm not sure what paste this is (probably minced tuna belly) but it sure was yummy, especially with the light spicy spring onions. We noticed that people came in to take away some awesome don made with similar ingredients, which i suspect to be the Negitoro Kaisen Don ($14.95). Now that looked really mouthwatering with the generous chunks of marinated sashimi, minced tuna belly, salmon roe and tempura batter. ZOMG. Definitely coming back for this.If a fish is good enough for me to pick off all the meat from the bone, it is good enough for anyone. Hur. The charred soy bits on the exterior of the Hamachi slice was so good with the fatty collagen from the cheek! I'm dreaming of fish tonight..The sashimi was fresh, sweet and buttery. What more can i ask for! Absolutely worth my 60 bucks.Barnacles. I've seen plenty of them during my dives and they always look really gross. But after Teppei, i'm seeing them in a different light. It tasted like any other crustacean but i think it's most similar to the tail part of the crab claw (which i love). It's soft, briny and has a slightly roe-ish texture.I've never had unagi tempura before and i guess there is a reason for that. The moisture in the unagi softens the batter quickly so it kinda spoiled the crunch. But if you love unagi, this 10x4cm parcel is gonna make you very happy. The tempura course changes so you may not get this.A rather substantial portion of stir-fried Wagyu cubes which i found to be on the powdery side. Hmm..For the main course, you should only order 1 thing, and that is the Sashimi rice. Trust me you won't regret it. Fresh seafood was paired with Japanese Koshihikaru sushi rice from Toyama. The uni was to die for.Wait no longer. Ok actually you have to wait a long long time. But make a booking and i swear you wouldn't be disappointed
