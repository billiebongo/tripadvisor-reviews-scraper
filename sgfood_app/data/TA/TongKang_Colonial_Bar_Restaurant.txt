This is a good place for large groups to dine and also for cocktails. We had a group of 39 people and had a private boat. The boat is stationary. Food was reasonable

This is an awesome experience that everyone should try once if you are visiting Singapore. The wagyu tenderloin and crispy truffle fries are outstanding! They have a very helpful staff that will make you feel special. And even the ambiance is so relaxing and chill, very nice place to dine and drink with friends or family.

My wife and I went out to dinner on Saturday Feb 11th to Clarke Quay. We chose TongKang because it was a restaurant boat on the Singapore river and seemed romantic.First, our server did not know the menu, the specials, or what drinks specials they offered that night. She disappeared and we have to go find her. When she returned, we ordered beer, lobster bisque and sushi ( she did not know the sushi, so she disappeared again to find out). The soup came out in a small cup, and looked like river water, not lobster bisque. Tasted like water down tomato soup, no lobster at all and it was very expensive. We had to go find our waitress again to get some napkins, took her forever to get napkins. After we sat for a while finishing our beers, we wanted to leave ... again no waitress. Finally, we left our seats and tracked her down for the bill. She made an error on the check, but finally fixed it for me to sign. All in all we were there for about 90 minutes, and all we had was a beer, some sushi and soup. A waste of our evening. We have never had such poor service or food in Singapore, don't visit TongKang when you are here
