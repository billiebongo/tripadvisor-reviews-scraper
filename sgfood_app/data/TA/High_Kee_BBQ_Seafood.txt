Had mussels with sambal sauce, salted egg prawns and seafood rice. Huge portions and all delicious. Kind staff as well. We'll certainly go back there!

When we asked a local taxi driver about good local food at good prices he told us that the locals favourite haunt for dinner was "East Coast Lagoon Food Village". So my husband and I, our adult children and their spouses thought it was worth a try. It is situated north of the city CBD up towards the airport and it is a series of dozens and dozens of small cafes/ outdoor restaurants all in a very small area right on the beach with stacks of tables, some with umbrellas and some under cover. You can wander around and order plates of food from different vendors and they will deliver to your table. The food quality generally is very good but some like 'High Kee BBQ Seafood" (stall 11) are excellent. We ordered Chilli crab, Singapore chicken rice, tempura squid amongst other things and the quality was superb, without a doubt the best food we had during our stay in Singapore. The rice and crab were beyond excellent and the staff were fast and polite, they also sell non seafood meals. The meals seemed to come out to us in minutes. There are stalls that sell beer and cider, also young coconut and the local sugarcane drink. If you want a truly local experience (we were the only foreigners there) try High Kee BBQ Seafood (stall 11)at the East coast Lagoon Food village. The food was so good we went back again the next night and tried some of there beef dishes and satay chicken kebabs
