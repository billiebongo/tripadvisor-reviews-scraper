Was there to try out the lunch set. Price was good for the food quality and quantity given. Kim Chi tastes delicious!

The food quality is consistent. Love everything that we ordered - Beef galbi, Samgyupsal, kimchi fried rice, japchae, kimchi pancake (we order 2 rounds of this!).

Menu are more of set meals . Still prefer the outlet at Amara hotel . Food wise still alright . A quick Korean fix if you are having cravings !

It was pretty disappointing meal after hearing the hype on the restaurant. Perhaps the Amara hotel outlet would be better.

Ordered the standard Bulgogi set and Ginseng Chicken soup. Taste was above average. Price was good since it is a restaurant. Side dishes was plentiful and the kimchi was not too spicy.
Added this place to go when I visit Raffles City for meals

Nice n tasty are the words. Although was a little over priced but given the location in Raffles City, guessed was still alright!

My colleague craved for Korean food while we were near Raffles City shopping mall, so we went to the food court at the basement and dined at this place. It was good but nothing special. This place is rather not expensive as the portions were huge. Service quite okay too

Looking to eat just to survive? Not picky about the quality and just how authentically Korean your food is? Seeking semi affordability? Then this is the place to eat at.The side dishes offered were sub par in spite of the seemingly generous 4 dishes. The seafood pancake only had a smattering of seafood that was more batter than scallions and seafood. The main dish which I ordered was seafood and tofu stew. It was definitely more like just tofu stew. Let's just say the efficiency and attentiveness of the staff was the only excellence I experienced
