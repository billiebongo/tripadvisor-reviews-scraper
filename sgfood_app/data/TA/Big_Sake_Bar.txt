Saw them on magazine decided to try them out. Great place and very good food. After this visit, I already planned next visit with them.

Visited on a Saturday night with advance booking. The restaurant is a small setup. The waiter and waitress are very polite. The food is good especially the oyster, though it’s expensive (15$/pc), very tasty.

Food is not worth the price and quality. Although the range of sake is extensive but the quality is not worth the price point.

A Friend recommended this place. Cosy setup and good range of sake available. Food is delicious as well! Tiffany, who tended to us, was very knowledgeable, made good recommendations and overall made the dining/drinking experience even better. We will be back.

Was eyeing their signature rolls which were apparently available under entertainer but they gave us a different menu with downgraded items at the same original price. First time experiencing this for the entertainer. Food was alright.

The dÃ©cor of the place was nice and cozy, perfect for a date or if you want to find a chill place with your buddies. The assorted sashimi was fresh and well worth the price. The skewers were done just nice so that the chicken wings, enoki bacon and mushrooms were still juicy and sweet. a definite must try!!!

Came here for a quick bite today. Opted for 2 of the chef's rolls, the California roll and the salmon roll. Both were adequate but not exceptional. Not many people in here at lunchtime. Seemed like a pretty good selection of sake but didn't try any. Service was efficient, if not altogether welcoming
