Definitely not the best Hainan Chicken in town. Even Hong Kong has much better Hainan chicken dishes around.
5
Yes price is steep as its actually the coffee house for mandarin orchard. Only come here for the chicken rice. Rice is cooked perfectly and chicken is also steamed correctly with the correct dosage of their sauces.
4
A bit upscale for local fair, chatterbox delivers in spades in taste when it comes to local food - their signature lobster laksa is delicious and rich in taste, their chicken rice is very famous and the rest of the menu - all consisting of cafe food are all worth while. All this in a nice lobby environment of the mandarin orchard helps pass time for a casual dinner or even a late night bite. This place is open quite late, a novelty for good eateries in Singapore. I have been here multiple times - friends and family included. the service is swift and efficient as well. A permanent fixture if you can't decide what to eat in orchard
5
Though it might be a little more expensive than other restaurants, I always prefer to come to Chatterbox for chicken rice and satay when traveling with young children.Food is good and place is clean. Good good at central Orchard Road. Satay by the bay offers many choices but might not be as clean and toilet friendly.
5
I have been enjoying the Chicken Rice at Chatterbox for in excess of 40 years. Each and every time I am visiting Singapore I drop in for a Chicken Rice. Many locals will say Chatterbox is too expensive etc.. but consider the regular tourist will not travel to a Hawker Centre. For a visitor to SIN and Orchard Road - it is just perfect
3
Nothing out of the blue on the chicken rice thus 3 stars instead of 4.Service is "hotel style expected". Nice portion of chendul and coconut ice-cream. Will go for dessert again
3
One of the places that started selling chicken rice decades back. Standard has dropped but still worth a try
4
The food was not as well as expected, it was nice but do not have the wow factor. The atmosphere is good, service was good but the bill wasn’t correct, they charged an extra drink which I didn’t ordered, but amended it once I verified before paying.
3
Standard has dropped quite abit, but still easily 1 of the better chicken rice around town. Make sure you order the full set

Returned here after a 12 year hiatus. I was so excited to eat this as my first meal in Singapore and remembered this as being delicious. Service was poor despite there being many waiters around. We had to wave one down to order. We had 2 chicken rice which was expensive at $27++. We also ordered wine and a beer. The food came before our drinks and honestly, we were very underwhelmed. The chicken was cold, the rice bland and it came with the 3 sauces and a garnish of tomatoe, cucumber and carrot. Very plain. After we finished we were not offered coffee or dessert and then had to ask twice for the bill. After giving our credit card we waited another 10 min to get it back and then the waiter did not give us a receipt so we had to go to the cashier to ask. Total cost was $100 which seemed incredibly expensive for what we got. Left disappointed.

To a tourist/visitor like me, S$27 Hainanese chicken rice in a hotel restaurant may not sound ridiculously expensive but to a local, it is outrageous as a similar dish can be enjoyed for a small fraction of that price in a hawker stall. It takes away attention from the quality of the food preparation which to me was satisfactory. My local host ordered the char kway teow so I can get a taste of another of my favorite Singapore dishes. She was not too happy with it and said it was oily and soggy. Me, I was a happy camper and enjoyed my calamansi juice as well. But then, I’m a visitor
4
we ordered 2 chicken rice ( legs) & 1 coconut. the chicken was really tasty and the sauce’s really good. the coconut was also delicious. the only highlight would be the price. the price was a bit expensive. the total bill was around $ 80. but its worth it for us. definitely would be backed anytime soon.
5
Having eaten quite a lot of chicken rice in food courts I finally decided to try the one at Chatterbox. I have always heard of its famous dish. We went in late afternoon and ordered a chicken rice and a fish curry. It was simply very good. I totally enjoyed the dishes despite the high prices.The chicken is tender as I have chosen the drumstick. The taste is quite distinct as well. I also really enjoyed the fish curry. The curry sauce was so tasteful I could simply eat it with the rice.It was a totally enjoyable meal. I would certainly go thete next time to try the other dishes as well
3
We want to try Singapore foods before leaving and so went to here. The foods were fair and not as good as those in the city
4
The laksa is food. The salmon is also very nice. The pricing is a bit pricey. If the price is lower a bit will be more appropriate. Can pay the same or Lower price for buffet beside this.

This probably was the most disappointed and over-priced meal we had in Singapore . When Chatterbox made it to a few Honourable-Mention lists, we perhaps should have looked into the price. SGD27++ for a set of chicken rice? Pure daylight robbery . It wasn't even good, chicken was tough and stringy, rice was dry and boring. Cherry tomatoes, lettuce and carrot 100% did not belong on the plate. The saving grace of our meal was probably the salted egg chicken wings , they were crispy and evenly coated in crumbly salted egg yolk. But still, SGD20++ for 5 wings?I'm still baffled at how some people claim this "the best chicken rice in Singapore". Is this the only chicken rice they've ever eaten in their lives
4
Servings is quick! Staffs are friendly and helpful! There will be long queue during weekend and holiday season!
4
The restaurant is located in a hotel, hence expect hotel price food. Open tills 2am.Chicken rice is the signature dish in Chatterbox. Comes in a set with tofu soup, oiled rice and 3 sauces (sweet soya, ginger and chilly).
4
My friend brought me there to try the famous chicken rice and the robster laksa.They were both brilliant!! It is so worth a try
5
Buffet breakfast, when staying at the Mandarin Orchard Hotel is served at the Chatterbox. It has a superbe and flavoursome spread that really gets the batteries charged for the day
5
 we came here for our early dinner on our anniversary.. the Mrs had her fave chicken rice, dubbed the best in Singapore (and the most expensive, at SIN$25,£14,US$18). i ordered the wagyu beef burger, it was excellent. then i saw an advert of salted egg fish skin (look at my pictures)and that was out of this world!!! at SIN$18, it was worth it!! go n try it.
5
Kinda did not mind this restaurant in the beginning. Looks so unassuming and the ambience looks ordinary. Looks like a cafeteria but ended up eating here on our second to the last day. I love chicken rice and people were recommending this place as one of the first to serve and popularise this dish in the 70s. Glad we ordered it! Was so tasty and amazing. Th rice and soup are meals on their own super tasty. Chicken was succulent and juicy. It’s a shame the serving was small could have eaten 2 orders. But I must say taste was the best of all the chicken rice I’ve eaten. The Bah ku te was great as well. Very herbal and aromatic. Better than the stinky cheap tasting ones yuh have at food courts. Presentation was top class!The lobster lahksa. Oh my creamy and rich! Too bad I split with my mom could have eaten one on my own with the chicken rice and bak kuh teI recommend coming to this place
5
Food is excellent. Service is superb! Did not wait too long for the food to come and was served with politeness.
4
Each time I come back here the chicken rice always hits the spot. Simply love the fragrant rice and tender drumstick... will be back for more
4
Chicken rice was delicious. Service was good. Good place to have a family dining. My children like their food as well
5
They say it's the best chicken rice in the world ,so did go and try it with my Swiss friends visiting Singapore for the 1st time .Well it was everything what one says and more restaurant was full with a long line waiting but worth every bite Chicken specifically checked and grown in Malaysia for the restaurant
3
Ate here after flying into Singapore late - the food was nothing special but the advice was excellent. Interesting options on the menu.
4
Heard that the chicken rice here is one of the best and decided to try it out. The serving was perfect for me- not too small and not too big. The chicken was succulent and the rice is fragrant. I do feel that it is costly as there are many chicken rice stalls out there. The satay and spring rolls are delicious too. The service was alright. Overall, a nice experience
5
Singapore chicken rice. Big serving. Big price. Fabulous taste. Way more expensive than the street variety but can't complain. Always perfect
1
Visited for lunch today with friends. It took 25minutes to get drinks - I had already got water for the table as no one else had bothered. But we had to complain twice in order to get the other drinks we ordered. Then two people (out of the five of us) got their food within 20mins which was fine - apart from the fact it arrived before our drinks! But then it took another 10 minutes for the third person to get their food. The fourth 5minutes after that. I got my food 45 mins later when everyone else had finished eating - so I ate with everyone watching me! The chicken rice was very good (and I am not a massive fan of the dish normally) but the rest of the food was very average. The fried prawns had thick batter. The satays were not very meaty. The pork and noodles was very rich and needed some spring onions or more greenery to cut through the taste. The burger had cheap Kraft single cheese which is not what you expect from such a restaurant, especially at the prices they charge. I would not recommend here as the food was average - apart from the chicken rice - and the service was extremely poor
4
I'm glad this place is still around. The chicken rice is very tasty, chicken soft and succulent and it was a good size. You can definitely find cheaper chicken rice in town but the taste "satisfaction" factor might not be as high. Well worth checking out although it's a bit pricey at SGD27++
5
CHATTERBOX located at the Mandarin Orchard Hotel provides the best LAKSA with Lobster and CHICKEN RICE. We also enjoyed their version of Chicken Curr
4
Fantastic service from Chatterbox Duty Manager, Ms June Chai. I was saddled with lots of shopping bags when I arrived at the coffee-house. June very thoughtful
4
Flavourful chicken and fragrant rice. Even the condiments are fantastic. And they seem to churn out great chicken rice consistently... each time I pop by for a meal it's equally delightful.
3
It was dubbed as the best chicken rice in singapore. and at $28++ per serving, probably the most expensive one. However, i dont feel that it is woth the $28. Yes it is tasty. But there are so many other chicken stalls in singapore and you could have made your money better spent elsewhere. But for a once in a lifetime experience, i would say it is worth it. But just a taste of best chicken rice, go elsewhere
3
Chicken rice was good and portion was generous as well but just not value for money at $32 per plate after GST.
5
Was there to celebrate a friend's birthday as we loved their signature lobster laksa! It was pricey but it's a hotel restaurant after all. Besides laksa, we also ordered their signature chicken rice and also salted egg chicken wings. Their food are still as yummy as ever. Will be back again
1
I know that Chatterbox's original chef that made the killer chicken rice has left, but I wasn't expecting it to suck so much. The chicken was dry. Last time it was juicy and succulent. It's just not good anymore. And the location is in some back alley behind the Mandarin Orchard lobby. It definitely didn't feel like part of the hotel.
5
We come back for the Chicken Rice. We first visited this restaurant 4 years ago, and my 9-year-old still remembers it.
5
Local Singaporean food. Order rojak. Like it especially the peanut sauce. Hainanese chicken rice is good. Chicken is good with good sauce and soup and rice. Chendol is good. Decoration is average. Usual fast food ambience. Servers need to be improve. Served main course before salad. As a result main course was cold when ready to eat. There is no offer from the waiter to keep the food warm while eating salad.
3
... the chicken's a quite dry. For the price point, we were expecting it to be really delicious. Food is expensive but i guess you also pay for the ambiance. Good quiet place for meetings
4
The famed Mandarin Chatterbox Chicken Rice lives up to its reputation. The chicken is cooked just right and the sauces are the perfect accompaniment. Other local dishes like Seafood Hokkien Noodles, Laksa, egg yolk fish skin and chicken wings are authentic, tasty and beautifully presented. We were there during National Day celebrations and several dishes were on promotion. A nice touch to a very enjoyable meal.
5
Chatterbox is the place to go if you want to enjoy Singapore's signature local dishes at a posh joint. The chicken rice truly is remarkable
4
Nice restaurant. Staff is friendly and efficient We tried our favourite Hainanese Chicken rice at a a price 3/4 times higher than the street but it is worth it. The garlic , ginger and chilli sauce are great . Frankly though the street chicken rice may taste similar but the sauce and presentation is better . Lobster Laksa is also a must try ... not cheap though.To conclude it is quite expensive but nice ambience and great taste
5
The food is the same standard as what we tasted a couple of years ago, hotel rate but not disappointing. Happy to be able to use Chope voucher & saved $5
5
Introduced the young members of my staff to the world famous restaurant serving Hainanese Chicken Rice. Tasty, authentic & never equaled. Service was efficient & prompt
3
The signature hainanese chicken is definitely a must go for however the price is quite high and the setting is very bad. The restaurant deco is not old but poorly designed
5
Wonderful experience. The rice was flavourful. The chicken was tender and delicious. This could be the best chicken rice here in Singapore. But of course, due to where it is located, it is very pricey. Be prepared to fork out almost $30 for a chicken rice set.
4
The atmosphere was good. We ordered a lobster laksa,the taste was good but not so hot. It was a little bit disappointed for me
4
One of the most consistent Hainanese Chicken Rice course in Singapore. For $27 you can choose between white or dark meat chicken, with a generous bowl of rice, soup and an accompaniment of soya, ginger and Chili paste. It's yummy!Chicken satay, Laksa, Nasi Lemak are other available choices. It's a gourmet street food Singapore restaurant! For beginners this is a good place to start tasting Singapore food
5
I like it a lot when I am able to find all the typical local dishes in one restaurant. In this case, Chatterbox. While having to prepare for such a broad range of food, it also enhances the taste of them while Chatterbox attempts to make the dishes consist of all the nutrition we need at the same time. Unlike some other restaurants, I always feel better when eating at Chatterbox. Eg: Not having to worry about the quality of ingredients they are using. Lastly, the environment there is ever so peaceful and clean that truly boast your appetite.
4
Chatterbox has been serving the world's BEST chicken rice! They serve it perfectly done here -- from the fragrant rice to the tenderest of chicken to the well-blended sauces. Worth the price tag. When I was pregnant, I ate two full servings of this dish. Eat this here and you'll not want to eat chicken rice anywhere else. One thing you've to bear with here is the old school service -- which means, the older serving staff aren't very friendly.

We stayed at Mandarin Orchard a couple of times over past years but haven't got to try their famous Hainanese Chicken Rice. Hence we decided that this is time!Arriving at around 1PM, we thought there wouldn't be any queue as it's quite past lunch time but this was proven wrong! However the waiting time wasn't that bad, around 15 mins later we were escorted to our table.Not quite a fan on the chair design as for ladies with bags, you can't even sling it and it's too narrow to put it on your back. You practically have no other option to put it on your lap, which is very uncomfortable while eating. I hope they invest in some other solution for the ladies! (as one of the posh restaurants surely service must also be top notch).As a first timer, we ordered two signature dishes, Hainanese Chicken Rice and Lobster Laksa. In addition we also ordered Salty Eggs Chicken Wings. The Hainanese Chicken Rice is exquisite, a very classic rendition of what it's supposed to be. Love every bit. About Lobster Laksa, well the lobster is just a more expensive substitute for prawns, but the real winner is the broth! Silky smooth coconut laksa broth, very tangy and flavorful. I would put their laksa into my go-to-laksa everytime I'm in town. Salty Eggs Chicken Wings delivered its name, but that's about it. If you're in the hood for a limited time and would like a representative of Singapore favorite dishes, this place would be it
4
I love Hainanese chicken rice To secure a table, make sure you arrive 30 minutes before lunch or dinner , Good eating place to go to
2
In clearing table, waiter used wet cloth to swipe the leftover chicken rice grains from table onto floor. As tables were placed quite close together, I was quick to duck to avoid getting rice grains flying onto my shoes. Chicken Rice quality - ok but not fantastic anymore. Staff quality deteriorated (my neighbouring table asked for bill but waiter generated bill for my table right after my order; at end of meal, when I asked for bill, waiter forgot to get bill).
4
The signature chicken rice set is served with side local sauces. All their chicken are served without bones which is perfect for a cosy afternoon meeting over a meal.
4
This is a good restaurant for tourists to try out local dishes. The taste is authentic and a good reference for local food. Price is quite costly compared to average restaurants and hawker. But the location is centralized and nice to chill out so that's what you pay to get. Service is quite slow and the crew seems disorganized in the way they handle customers so do be patient. Overall this place is worth a tr

We brought several of our friends visiting Singapore for dinner last week hoping to give them a memorable meal. We had about 10 of us. Each person was served at different times, the last order was only served to us almost 1 hour after the first ordered was served and everyone had already finished their food and we were able to leave. I think this is not acceptable. When we requested to cancel the order since we were about to leave, the response was "its already cooked" and the staff looked unhappy. Other than that, I found the staff quite disorganized as they also forgot our request and served the wrong drink to the table which we didn't complain about.We paid for the meal as ordered but definitely not somewhere i would want to bring my friends to again
5
I'm not a huge fan of chicken rice, I'll eat it, but I don't particularly like it. However, this chicken rice is really the best I've ever tried. Some people might not think it is worth it for the price, but good quality chicken and ingredients are hard to come by. The chicken is tender and soft, and the rice fragrant and tasty. Soup is great. Also, the salted egg yolk dishes are amazing. The price of the chicken rice is indeed high, at 30 odd dollars, but even if you do not wish to eat there often, it is definitely worth a try. I have heard many people say that this is their favourite chicken rice and that they often come back (even from overseas) to taste their food
4
A good and clean place on Orchard Road to enjoy Singaporean hawker food though a bit pricey. I especially liked the bak kuet Tei ( spicy pork ribs soup), chicken rice and the stir fried turnip cake.
2
Met a couple of friends for lunch. They ordered Wan ton noodles (S$24++) and sea food bee hoon (S$32++). I had baked salmon (S$32++). I had coffee for S$9++. Nothing outstanding.The chicken rice that the Chatterbox is famous for goes for S$32++. I will not pay this much for chicken rice. Guess my friends did not want to either. The local food can be purchased for about a quarter of the price or less in a food court or a hawker centre and probably taste better.Service was efficient
5
Most expensive chicken rice in town because the Hainanese chicken rice which normally costs $3 at any hawker centre. The chicken slices are tender
3
Been here a couple of times. Good choice if you are looking to recommend tourists to local food in a nice comfortable environment. If you're a local, you are better off in Hawker Centre if you know where to head to and don't mind the heat.Service wise, expect standard level of hotel service. The free wifi is definitely a plus point
3
Went there tonight. This place is pretty well hidden within this huuuge hotel but is aparently pretty well recommended by locals. I tried their signature dish, which is chicken-rice. It comes with three sauces to make it as spicy as you wish. I liked the food but was not overly impressed. Nothing bad, but nothing impressive either. My colleagues shared a local black rice dessert which looked nice, but was pretty tasteless aparently. All in all a nice experience and good size portion
4
Good place to enjoy hawker food, clean and nice restaurant. Been here a few times and simply love their chicken rice and also lobster laksaSituated in Orchard Mandarin hotel make it convenient for shoppers to rest their legs after shopping in orchard road to
4
returning after five yearsChicken Rice (SGD 27) is still as good but we think the portion shrunk a bitLobster Lakes (SGD 36) still taste heavenly price has gone up (I think)nonetheless, the place is still as pack during lunch and dinner. If you are shopping and do not want to eat at food court and willing to spend, this is as good as you can get for Singapore Hawker Fare in a comfortable environment.
5
They still maintain the same standard! Tender Chicken, Fragance Rice, other dishes also fantastic!
5
Excellent food and service. By the time we got to the restaurant at 10:15 they told us that the last order and they close at 10:30 p.m. but the service were still amazing. Must order or try: Hainan chicken, Bah kut teh and the roujak.
5
Been here ever since I was a child and still loving it ! More than twenty years and counting. They have delicious laksa and hor fun too.
5
I ordered the Signature Chicken Rice, Lobster Laksa, Seafood White Bee Hoon and Satay. All were great, except the White Bee Hoon which was so-so
4
Chicken rice can found everywhere in Singapore, this is the first restaurant that we tried the boneless chicken rice many years ago, the restaurant was on the ground level and it looks more attractive before. The chicken rice set is still good
4
Tried the famous chicken rice, big portion. juicy and tender. Lobster laksa was sold out, only left with seafood laksa, which was also nice. Overall I think the local food court is more value for money and delicious
5
Growing up in Jakarta, Singapore has always been a place to go for a short weekend getaway, and whenever me and my family went to Singapore, we always stop by at Chatterbox for their Hainanese Chicken Rice, which is so very easy to miss. After moving to France 11 years ago, I haven't, not once, had a decent Hainanese Chicken Rice. So, coming to Singapore with my husband, I figured I should really show him the place that served the best hainanese chicken rice in the world, a place I've loved since I was just a kid. He absolutely loved it. We know that we wouldn't be able to come back to Singapore a lot, so we went all out. Ordered the chicken rice each, and the laksa to share. The first bite brought back a lot of memories for me while it created new ones for my husband.I don't think staying the same would be a problem for you seeing as it has been years and it's still the same as when I last visited more than a decade ago. Thank you, thank you, thank you.Love,Johann & Gig
5
I'm sure there are loads of very good hainan chicken restaurants in Singapore, but this is my favorite because of the quality of food plus environment. Very good seating, I like their barley tea and there's really nothing to complain about except maybe the price? But for this quality of food, I think it's a reasonable price to pay.
5
My first time to Chatterbox. I had one of the best seafood hor fun ever! Now I must go back there again
4
Food and ambience of restaurant is good. But 27++ for the chicken rice is something you can consider having once in a long while if you decide to pamper yourself.
4
Friendly relaxed restaurant and efficient service. Greta place to meet and discuss the days events over dinner. Their Chicken speciality dish a must try
3
If you ever talk to people about Hainanese Chicken Rice in a hotel, chances are, this place will be mentioned and honestly while there are street stalls much nicer than this, there is, as far as we can recall, no other hotel that serves as good as this. So the chicken is soft and succulent, rice fragrant and the chilli just nic
4
Had a business lunch with colleagues here during our stay at the Mandarin Orchard. The food overall was really praiseworthy, the service could improve a tad bit as one of us had to wait for their food longer. Would recommend it to people visiting Singapore!
5
When in Singapore / Malaysia , you must try Hainan Chicken Rice , they just do it right here ! Rice Hawker stalls provide excellent value ( like Tien, Tien at Mawwell foodcourt) ,however usually crowded and long wait . In recent visits , we prefer Chatterbox on level five at the Mandarin Orchid hotel . The place can be very busy , we arrived this time 530 pm , no problem finding a table All 4 of us ordered The signature dish , Hainan Chicken rice , fresh chicken , just simply boiled ,and slightly undercook , preserved the moist and tenderness and favor of the meat, we prefer legs then breast( actually breast is good too , much better than any western style over cooked chicken ) . This came with favored rice ( with chicken broth ) , soup, and chili , ginger and soy sauce . The portion is generous ( I can have another one since is so good ) . The price is 4/5 times more compare with Hawker Stall in food court . As a tourist , the comfort setting is worth the money. . If i live here I have this 3 times weekly , I will go to a Hawker place for sure .i have to educate my Non Asian to overcome the fear of slight undercook chicken ( red in marrow) , taste so much better and safe 
4
This is a go-to place for many who are looking for authentic Singaporean food. The more adventurous will venture into the hawker centre, but the Chatterbox is a more controlled environment
4
Went to this restaurant and have its signature dish, Hainese Chicken Rice. Rice was tasty especially with the ginger, chilli and black sauce. The chicken was smooth and portion was generous. That explain the price you pay for. Never disappoint me
5
I enjoyed eating the chicken rice at Chatterbox. It is fragrant. Stumbled across this cafe while I was staying in Mandarin Orchard. The best decision to dine in here. Other cuisines like Fried Flat Noodles and Vegetarian Vermicelli is delicious as well. Definitely must try
4
the hainanese chicken rice set was very tasty and the chicken was fresh and succulent. bit pricey though. hawker stalls offer similar at a fraction of the pric
5
It's a bit pricey, but the portions suffice. The chicken rice and lobster laksa is always good to order and so is the salted egg chicken.
5
The Chatterbox usually does not take reservation, but the Concierge at our hotel managed to book a table for us. The award winning Hainanese Chicken Rice is absolutely delicious, especially with the chili sauce and ginger sauce. The lobster laksa and coconut rice are also tasty.The services are very nice. They promptly brought us plates and bowls when you learned that we would like to share the dishes, and when we said that we would like to keep the ginger sauce after finishing the Hainanese chicken rice, the waitress brought us another ginger sauce. We would like to go there again when visiting Singapore the next time. Review in Chinese:这家餐馆一般不接受预订，但我们住的酒店还是想办法帮我们订了座位。这家餐馆的海南鸡饭是得过奖的，果然名不虚传，非常美味，特别是沾特制的辣椒酱和姜汁吃。龙虾叻沙和椰浆饭也很好吃。服务很好，上菜快。当服务员知道我们是想点各种菜几个人分享时，马上拿来了几套碗碟。当知道我们特别喜欢姜汁时，又主动拿来一碟。还会再去
4
Their signature Chicken Rice set is delicious. I have tried their seafood hor fun and satay too. Both are good.
4
Good service, food was good and came in pretty fast. Price was fair to be at the hotel, suitable for a quicker dinner when you just want to eat
4
despite the plentitude of chicken rice stalls in Singapore, despite other Bib Gourmand awards, praises by star celebrities like Anthony Bourdain, or even recommendations of the best chicken rice stalls by Singaporean friends, for some very very odd reason, the best chicken rice for me is the one served by Chatterbox inside the Mandarin Hotel on Orchard Road.I can't justify it. This is expensive, high-end, but fragrant and delicious. I'm addicted
4
Many times here. Good service. Quick. Chicken rice is good and not expensive. Clean place. Well located in Mandarin Orchard mall.
4
Had late dinner at chatterbox with a friend.Ordered their famous chicken rice and herbal BA GUA TEH. Food wise was ok and the service was so-so maybe due to the large crowd.A good place for lunch & dinner, small group gathering and family dinner.Dr E. Cho
3
It is very seldom that I write a negative review,...but here is one. I remember Chatterbox when I first courted my misses over 28 years ago. So we decided to revisit this on our recent trip to Spore (01/17). However the food was below average. Their signature dish, the Mandrind Chicken Rice was only fair,...the special fried rice waz poor. For the price tag....i cannot recomend it!!
5
Had a lovely lunch here. Surprised at prices as not mentioned by other reviewers. So I'm going to note that its not the cheapest place to eat (if you want cheap and cheerful go to a hawkers market). But the food was delicious and service efficient and friendly. Lobster laksa is one of the best laksas I've had. Also took us a while to find the place as it is on the 5th floor! Access via the Mandarin Orchard Hotel or the Mandarin Gallery shopping mall right next door to the hotel
3
Ambience was great but pricing of the items on the menu is steep considering these are regular hawker fare as well as the quality of food is not great. Other than the much acclaimed chicken rice which is fairly decent, the nasi lemak was a huge disappointment as the fried anchovies were extremely hard and almost felt like biting on plastic! Definitely not worth paying $25 for the nasi lemak
4
This Chicken rice i ate since i was a child.The Chicken rice and Lobster Laksa is one of the best in Singapore but the price until now still expensive...I already ate Chicken rice at Maxwell Food Court,Chicken rice ball or chicken rice at Hawker place but Chatterbox always remind me to came again and again
3
I would have expected a lot more having to pay so much and also queue for so long. Good but not great. A lot more amazing choices in Malaysi
4
Food is ok, i've tasted better chicken rice in other place. White curry noodle was better. One annoying thing was that the server didnt give me the change, it's not much but it's about honesty, i waited quite long and finally i left. Or maybe the server thought that it was a tip for him ? Because he looked at me several times.
4
Having eaten there regularly in the 1900's, we went back in November 2016. The chicken rice is still the best and we were not disappointed
5
In my opinion chatterbox is still the best chicken rice in Singapore with the best service. My sister was having stomachache and she put the medicine on the table. Without asking the waitress serve her warm water noting the meds on the table. Will go try their lobster laksa next time
2
Mandarin Hotel Chatterbox... evokes memories of childhood where going to Chatterbox for chicken rice was a treatNow its just a tourist trapChicken rice was average But at $30 a serve - with no vegetables! - it shouldnt have been hawker centre standard! That means $120 a birdNo service. Order had to be checked on after everyone else had received theirs (so sorry part-timer mixed it up was all the response). After that no service at all At 8.45 they were busy setting up for breakfast the next dayWhile eating the waiters squeezed past your table as a shortcut to their station How would you like someones backside brushing past you as you ate every 10 seconds?!?Regular (read: old) patrons do dine here perhaps for the good ol days Sadly it has past for Chatterbox A few of the old staff are ok but they cant do everything...Tourists may like to try one of many good standard alternatives around such as Wee Nam Kee (United Square) Yeo's (Serangoon Rd) or if you can take the heat Ah Tai (Maxwell Road hawker centre) (Tip: stay away from the other tourist trap Tian Tian with the arrogant staff and poor quality rice Locals dont eat there!) Both places you can get a whole bird for less than $5

I came here by recommendation of a local as the best chicken rice in Singapore and I have to say it was very very good. Everything worked together brilliantly and the chicken was cooked perfectly and was generously put together. However, for thirty dollars per order, I find it very very hard to justify the value for money here when a five dollar order of chicken rice in another restaurant is just as good, minus of course the presentation and one or two extra pieces of chicken. That being said though, if you really needed a very safe choice for a chicken rice meal in Singapore and money is no object, you can't go wrong here

Chatterbox is well worth the effort of finding it - it is on an upper floor of the well-known Mandarin Orchard. The easiest way is the lift, if you can find it, otherwise take an escalator and keep going up again and again. When you get there, there is nowhere else to go! Oh, and do reserve a table in advance because it is hugely popular at lunchtime, and not only because of the fame of its Hainanese chicken rice (which, if you haven't tried it, you really should!). With no reservation, tell the staff and that puts your name into the queue. Whatever you order, the food is very good, the prices reasonable and the service, whilst good when you get it, was a bit patchy last time we went. And finally, for lovers of that Singapore dessert rarity, gula malacca, it's here - reserve some space for it
5
The chicken rice is made very well and we especially love the lobster laksa and its thick gravy. A great place for gathering as it is quiet and comfortable, best place to host guests from overseas who wants to try local delights.
3
Although i love the chicken rice but wow! You must be super rich to pay $27 for a portion which is not out of this world for that price. Really have to consider revising the price and am sure more people will come. If you want class and local food then this is the place else frankly you can get a better chicken rice elsewhere
4
Booked a room in the mandarin oriental right smack in the best place in orchard road, check in time is bit late so we decided to try the chatterbox... good move as we had excellent hainanese chicken with rice, really good!
4
We got the Chicken Rice again. My wife and daughter agreed that Chatterbox maintained and sustained the good quality of the food. Add to it, the place has good white wine to go with the chicken rice..
5
If you want to try an array of breakfast, from Oriental to Western, the Chatterbox daily breakfast buffet is the way to go. I personally loved the pink guava juice, fish balls (in some kind of red sauce) and roti pratta bread- I know it's not your typical breakfast food but just give it a try and maybe you'll love it too. The two employees that stood out the most at the Chatterbox were Marc and Kishen, they both were super friendly. Marc even took the time to explain the dishes to us and Kishen was very attentive. I didn't catch the gentlemen's name who is in charge of the omelette station, two thumbs up for him
3
Finally went to try the signature chicken rice. It was something that I wanted to try some time ago.
5
A must try at least once. the great dining experiece in a nice and elegant restaurant, with serving the best chicken rice which is a favourite for almost every Malaysian & Singaporean, what else you ask for 
4
Just a quick note that I've been eating at the chatterbox since the 90's. Went down with a friend and ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice. I'm glad to say the the taste is still exemplary. The portions could be a lot bigger for the price you pay as the chicken portions seem to have gotten a lot smaller. With that said, still good, tasty food and a really relaxed ambience.
5
We went to Chatterbox to sample their specialty, Hainanese chicken rice, and yes, it was presented really well, tasted great, and it hit the spot. Now, did it taste better than the cheaper ones you could get at the hawkers' market, say, Newton? That debate, I'll leave up to you. My conclusion: I could get the same quality, tasty Hainanese chicken rice at a hawkers market; but, Chatterbox has got the ambience down pat
5
This is one of the best chicken rice places I have ever eaten in Singapore. Nice and quiet cafe that also serves other excellent Chinese. Service is also good with attentive staff.
2
Everybody has been raving about Chatterbox Hainanese chicken rice so we thought we'd give it a try. Walked through mandarin orchard hotel and saw a long queue, didn't wait for too long and we got our table. Excited to have our food but was disappointed with the food in the end.The Hainanese Chicken Rice was ok, I have had better ones. Especially not at this price, it was SGD27++. We also ordered a bowl of the "Lobster Curry Laksa" at SGD36++ but was told that they didn't have lobster and will replace it with prawns at the price of SGD32++ . Was craving for some spicy noodles so we agreed and it came looking totally different from how it was depicted at the entrance. It was full of santan and it didn't taste anything like a bowl of traditional Curry Laksa. So expect to taste like those you often get in Australia. Not somewhere I would recommend my friends to come.
5
This is the buffet style restaurant where we had breakfast and it was very good with many excellent choices and plenty of seating. A lot of Asian cuisine but enough American to find plenty to eat and they did make omelettes to order as I recall. Latte/capuccino machine available to help yourself I really enjoyed:
3
Ok, so customer service is great and plentiful. They don't heat the chafing dishes though, so most food is cold, not tasty for westerners although selection is good! Great chef at egg/noodle bar. He is outgoing and his food is hot!! Pricy, but nothing extreme considering the location. We'll find a different restaurant next time....
4
Good taste and location. Chicken is soft but soup is so so. Easy to find the restaurant. Service is also good.
3
Everyone is talking about how good Chatterbox's Hainan chicken rice is but when we revisited a month ago we just found it still so so. We first visited two decades back and were not overly impressed then and this 2nd time round we were hoping for an improvement, especially with such great reviews in tour books / pamphlets etc.Resto has now moved to a new spot ( 5/F) and now enjoys a much bigger, brighter and more modern dining ambience. However, their tables are rather closely positioned so you might think you were sharing their conversation. When we were there at around 1pm, there were quite a lot of people waiting but we did not have to wait that long, say around 10 mins and then a table was set for us.As planned, we had Hainan chicken rice, which was not fab as commented above. The rice was good though --- each grain was al dente and evenly coated with a thin sheen of chicken broth. The chicken was just plain and I would say, rather bland and coarse albeit we know the Singapore govt has banned selling live chicken to prevent bird flue so all chickens available in Singapore are either chilled or frozen. Any professional kitchen should know how to cook chilled / frozen meat well , esp in Chatterbox when Hainan chicken is their big selling point. The chicken pieces were overly thinly sliced as thicker pieces give firmer, fuller bite. The soup was ok, could be hotter. This is supposedly their signature dish but it actually looks better in the poster and the menu than in the palate.We tried to order their heavily promoted lobster Laksa that is poster pinned everywhere but even at 1pm it was all sold for the day. They really should have stocked more of this crustacean then if they were trying hard to push its sales--it was not even past lunch! So we opted for fried beef in thick rice noodles, and when it arrived we did not like its appearance at all. It was TOTALLY covered in a pool of brown gooey sauce that did not whet the appetite the least. But then it tasted fairly good so that salvaged the total comment. Beef, like their chicken, was also bland--- this time too much soda used in the marinade. They should just use a little sugar and a little corn flour plus a little oil in the marinade ( best marinade for beef---no salt or soda pls). They should also have a bit of green veggie in this dish, at least to add a bit of health and colour to this dull brown dish.Chicken satay was not impressive, ordinary and not exciting. Maybe it was not chargrilled but just oven baked cos it lacked the aroma of fresh charcoal.What was best had to be the grass jelly in soy milk. It was scorching hot that day and this drink instantly quenched all thirst , what's best, it was not sweet at all! Just the natural soya milk flavour and the smooth grass jelly piped out from nozzles was a real winner although it was not the prettiest drink on earth. It was so good that we went for seconds. Go for this and you will not regret.We also had a cappuccino and that was standard fare but a real big cup so that's good value.Service was efficient although they were not overly keen to keep a good scout around and see if any patron was waving frantically for service.The bathroom is quite far away so don't wait until you cross your legs or...
4
Highlight!!! Og this restaurant menu is Hokkian style(Singaporean) chicken rice. There is also international cuisine to be ordered. I ordered tenderloin steak with fresh lychees in syrup drink. Laksa (rice noodle in curry soup) is also recommended. The service is very good. The price is also of its quality in the 5 starred hotel.
3
When I reached the restaurant and told them I made a reservation under my name, they seem to not know about it at all as the waitress looked shocked to not find my name in the list. Luckily it was an early lunch and there were ample seats. I hope this particular restaurant will have better communication with Chope (by making sure that customers that make reservations through Chope will be listed down)
5
This was my second time to eat at Chatterbox and this place never disappoints! The service is great. The place is comfortable. And the food is just to die for! Taking center stage, of course, is their Hainanese Chicken which they call Mandarin Chicken Rice. No one makes it better than Chatterbox. But their Lobster Laksa is something you must try as well. Every time I go to Singapore, I cannot NOT eat at Chatterbox
4
Located in Mandarin Orchard Hotel . Nice open set up for High end Singapore Hawker food . Staffs are friendly and efficient We tried our favourite Hainanese Chicken rice at a a price 3/4 times higher than the street but it is worth it. The garlic , ginger and chilli sauce are great . Frankly though the street chicken rice may taste similar but the sauce here is far superior . Lobster Laksa at $36 is thick with coconut gravy . We changed the thick to thin noodle . To conclude it is expensive but nice ambience and taste
5
Chatterbox chicken rice gonna be one of my favorite chicken rice in Singapore. It's located on 5 fl. Mandarin. The price was quite expensive but it's delicious!
5
Hainamese chicken rice is the famous dish of Singapore. Though I have tried some other recommendations, I still consider this is the best in town. Boneless chicken, delicious ginger sauce and dark soya sauce, all are the best. Of course, to add the six-star service and environment.Other nice dishes are satay, spring roll, and noodle etc.So I never miss whenever I come to Singapore. Remember to reserve a table for busy days and hours
3
I stayed in Mandarin Orchard again and had dinner in the Chatterbox when arrived for convenience.The restaurant is of simple modern (i.e. IKEA style) decoration with professional efficient service.The menu offers local/regional food as well as some western alternatives.I had a fish curry which was ok. The portion was sufficient and taste regular.The price however is to high for this kind of meal indicating that it's better to venture outside to find alternative if a simple meal is sufficient
4
Chicken rice very nice and fried Kwan Teow too, the children found them served differently from those they have at hawker center
5
As I have travel so often, so I rarely review eating places in Singapore, but today I have write about this place, not many cafe in the 5 star hotel is so dedicated to whip up great local dishes.This evening we ordered the legendary chicken rice, lobster laksa and fried Hokkien Noddles, all 3 dishes were so authentic and tasty.This is truly the original place to put Hainan Chicken Rice on global map, the receipe they have developed over the years still top notch, chicken so tenderly cooked and nicely slice, the chilli, soya and ginger sauce really make the best compliments, then the rice cooked with rich chicken oil and broth makes it so fragrance and so inviting to eat, is such a heavenly meal itself. Though many hotels in Asia now list Hainan Chicken Rice on menu, I have not tasted one that is equal or close to.The Libster Laksa is so rich with coconut milks, chili mixed with minced dried shrimp and onion etc, added with lobster, fish cake, dried bean curd make the dish so enjoyable. The fried Hokkien Noddle is a luxurious version, you get king prawns, scallop, fish cake and many other Ingridients, wok fried with superior stock added bean sprouts and chives and egg, the result is a rich tasting noodles.The service is not of fine dinning, but reasonable and attentive enough.So if you are visiting Singapore, this is an ideal place for you to sample local cuisine in its authentic flavor, though higher prices than street stalls, but it's socomfortable air-cond environment 
5
Concierge at the Marriot recommended for the Chicken Rice. It was excellent. White meat chicken cooked and sliced to perfection. The chicken soup was like the best kosher deli. Ver clean and pleasant setting in the Maderin hotel. Will return on my next trip to Singapore
3
Casual dining area is nice and large but it is very loud. Food was fine - my club sandwich was good and the chicken rice my wife had was very tasty. Drinks were $10 each for a basic barely water or coconut which I think is too much. The food was also quite steep price wise hence my rating of average compared to very good.
4
Everytime i visit this resto, i always order chicken rice.... one of the best i think.... they have a big portion also (as you can see at the picture). Beside, my father always order fish n chip... I have tried once, maybe not the best, but i think it was good enough, especially when i know they are not european resto, but chinesse... quite surprising that they can make fish n chip so good...
4
We had their signature chicken rice and also tried the new dish - chicken feet. Its yummy . will go there again .
5
The restaurant was quite crowded on a weekday lunch. The food comes in large portions and very good quality. Will visit agai
4
Tasty local dishes but price is a little steep.. they used more expensive ingredients to make up for the higher price.
4
This is the 2nd year I visited chatterbox with my family for the children birthday.The food is delicious, serving is good sufficient. I find their chicken rice so so though, my favourite is their coconut ice cream.
4
I love the chicken rice and the coconut ice cream and my friend had the fried kuey teow.. we were rushing through our lunch cos we have to catch our flights and the food and services didnt disappoint us...
5
Even if you are not a guest at the hotel i recommend you to come and try their famous Hainananse Chicken Rice. I think it is one of the best in town 
5
We dined in 2014 when we last visited Singapore. It is well known for the Chinese Chicken and rice, but I really went to have the coconut ice-cream with chocolate and walnuts served in the coconut shell. Ever since I tried it back in 2014 I always look for something similar, to no avail. The chicken and rice dish is very moist and delicious. My husband ordered the lobster Laska which he said was very filling and delicious. it is worth a visit but the casual dining restaurant is not cheap. It is in the Oriental Mandarin Hotel on 5th floor, and a bit difficult to find
5
It was raining heavily outside and hotel concierge ran out of umbrellas so my friend and I searched for the nearest lunch spot and was recommended this place.The price for local food was 2-3 times higher compared to hawker centers however their food portion was huge!!A must visit restaurant everytime I'm in Singapor
4
Went there for dinner with my wife last Sunday night. Service is excellent and even though there is a little queue, it was managed with minimal fanfare and I got my table around 10 minutes later! All good!Food is well portioned and service prompt, professional. A good variety of food and chicken rice is also one of the highlights there! Definitely a good place to feed all those hungry bodies looking for a clean, well-managed and nice foodie food, located right in the middle of Orchard road at the Mandarin Orchard hotel!Open till quite late - highly recommended for those who don't know where to go for good Singaporean food at reasonable prices
5
This restaurant is located in the Mandarin Orchard and after hearing all the hype I thought I would give the famous chicken and rice a go. It was much better than I expected, was so moist and tasty and with beautiful sauces to go with it.
5
First came here 15 years ago and it was excellent. Last visit was 10 years ago and it was still a market leader. This time it confirmed why it is one of the tastiest chicken rices in Singapore. It is a bit on the expensive side, but the superior quality, comfortable surrounds and attentive service make up for that. Chope 10% discount voucher online also helps.
5
Chicken rice and hor fun are all very nice.Staffs are helpful however, please be noted that during pick hours, they might forget your requests ... but not always.You can customize your order - they sure will make it as you want.So enjoy your meals hear ok
5
The fried calamari was super crispy. The singaporen chicken rice was absolutely delicious. The condiments that went with it was so different and tasty. The broth from the chicken was just perfect.. Except the bugs that kept bothering us i loved it. We were given a complimentary fruit platter due to this botheration
4
It has been ages since we last visited Chatterbox for their famous chicken rice.We re-visited on a weekend for lunch. When we arrived at the restaurant, there were diners waiting for a table. We were glad that we had made a reservation, so we were shown to our seats by the window.We ordered our food, none other than their signature chicken rice. We did not have to wait for long before our food is being served. It is exactly like the good old days. We had a choice of either the chicken drumstick or the chicken breast meat, and had one of each. The portion of the chicken is sufficient and the chicken meat is lean and tender. The dark soya sauce, chilli sauce and grated ginger were served in small dishes. The rice is fragrant and not too oily as well. If you like their chilli sauce and dark soya sauce, it is available for sale, as well as a "'cheeky chick" soft toy.No doubt it is quite pricey but it is well worth it, in terms of the taste, ambience and of course being situated in a five star hotel. Service is good as well. One issue which we encountered is the online reservation. The time slot is only available from 3 to 5 pm. So one would either have to email or call the restaurant to make reservations between 5 to 7 pm.We'll be back in the near future
3
Location - nearest mrt station is Somerset. Depending where are you approaching from.Food - Ordered the Bah Ku teh for myself and my friend ordered the salted fish fried rice. Both were delicious. 2 side dishes were ordered. One fried squid and the fried popiah.Service Visited on the 8th of July, Friday. Perhaps their experience service staff numbers are higher on weekends, that's why the service is much better. Not really that crowded as well.Value - Service and ambience feeling was much better this time so I rated them overall average due to their hotel prices
5
Some might find that this restaurant is pricey but they actually serve very good food. There are so many items in their menu that I like but I would recommend the chicken rice and laksa
3
Went here upon the hotel concierge's intro. I said I want chicken rice. You would have thought - concierge wld suggest a venue more authentic.To be fair the chicken was good. It's probably as good as the more "authentic" joints like 5-star.Problem is it is v v expensive. 2 adults 2 children. Bill came to Sing 210.....I - stupidly - ordered the lobster laksa. Don't get me wrong it was decent. Laksa soup was delicious. But the lobster (which meant it was bloody expensive) tasted pretty dead. Any freshness (if they were) would have been covered by the heavy laksa spice. To be frank, I cldnt figure out if it was fresh. It was rather chewy ...
4
We ordered the signature chicken rice ($27++) and a garden salad ($17++) to share as we wanted some fresh greens. The chicken and condiments were excellent. The portion of chicken was pretty generous. I personally preferred the breast meat to the drumstick but this is probably subjective. I found the rice and soup just OK though. The salad was large and came with two bread rolls and butter. Service was generally good but a little inconsistent - a couple of staff seemed new and confused. Drinks cost an average of $9. Overall a nice place to eat at, if you can afford it
4
Although this is an 'in-hotel' restaurant the menu captures the essence of Singapore's hawker market foods. Additionally, the elegant presentation and good service makes this a much more special experience
4
If you are missing some great Singaporean food, head to Chatterbox, Mandarin Hotel which is slightly off Orchard Road, next to Takashimaya. The all time favourites are its chicken rice which comes served piping hot with soup and your choice of vegetables and other popular dish is the laksa and bak kut teh.Chattrebox always have full patronage and I find lunch time is the best time to indulge in my favourite plate of chicken rice. Service is pleasing and this place is consistently good if you are willing to pay their prices for good local food. Service staff is season and knows how to upsell from its menu
5
Budget- permitting, you simply have to try this one. They clearly put in supreme effort at getting your chicken right, and it certainly arrived impeccably done. Service-wise, the staff were of all ages and experience, but they were professional to a fault. The only down side is the price, about 6 to 7 times more pricey than the equivalent you can get at a hawker centre
4
Yes this is one of the best places for chicken rice. This is an expensive chicken rice compared to the hawker markets, but for tourists its a great start. I love that you get to choose what cut of meat you want - then its all yours to go! At around $30 something Singapore dollars it is a bit pricey, but soo goo
4
I love laksa, so anywhere I go if there's laksa I will order. Came across lobster laksa in chatterbox order taste it and it was super. Since than have been telling all my friends and even bring them there to try (had a special credit card eat at the meritus 50% ). The card does not apply on eve of holiday which I was caught twice and pay full price. They had since discontinued this card.Price when starter was $29 now is $32.As usual I order the lobster laksa after so many years is still good. Friends order chicken rice $27 many said is expensive but I think it had it value, still the best seller in chatterbox. The chicken portion is generous presentation is class taste is good really cannot complain cannot compare. In life enjoy while you can so lucky to be able to enjoy your food.The egg york fried chicken wing was good new item. $18 for 6pcs.The abalone ko low mee is not idea $32 if remove the abalone $5.00 in hawker centre my friend remark. Haha.But I love my lobster laksa best. Yum yum
4
This restaurant is within the Mandarin Orchard hotel on the 5th floor. Very pleasant ambiance, attentive staff and a very good selection of oriental and western dishes.Good place to eat after a hard day sightseeing
4
Chatterbox is known for it's chicken rice and both my cousins absolutely loved it. I ordered the vegetarian stir-fry and noodles and both were nice. I loved the coconut ice-cream too. Since the place is famous for it's chicken rice, a local delicacy it can get very tough to get a table during the week-end so make a reservation and order the chicken rice for sure if you go :
1
Horrible place, overly priced and without a care in the world for their customers.Why bother come here when you can get food elsewhere that is much cheaper that is much better minus all the hype
5
Might be overpriced as what the locals may claim, but as a tourist, I would still make it a point to make a stop at Chatterbox whenever I'm in town. I still feel their Signature Chicken Rice is the best I ever tasted!
2
Average food. Nothing to write about, no dish was memorable and the place was loud and noisy. The service was excellent but that is the only good thing about this place
4
Food is quite tasty, but not significantly better than some Hawker food center... Central location, nice restaurant. Mainly for tourists as locals have better and cheaper options
4
If you like chicken rice with Singapore style, you must to go here even if the price is a little bit expensive around SG27. Remember to bring the homemade source to home
5
I'm a chicken rice lover, so when I tried the chicken rice for the first time, it tasted so good. The size is also good, not too small as other chicken rice. If you don't eat a lot, then you could share with others. I also like the fact that ask which part of chicken we would like to order. I would definitely come back again! :
5
We had our first dinner here and the food was great, mine was a bit spicy but I enjoy it and it was curry, but we came away happy
3
I enjoyed a tofu and veggie hot pot with steamed rice. It was quite tasty, but wasn't memorable. Very satisfying for a quick lunch and I may get it again at some point, but not worth a special trip. Good service.
4
Great sandwiches and atmosphere! Family dinning, or a cool date place for young couples. Great milkshakes too
3
we tried their chicken rice which is good with 3 choices of sauces to choose from. The taste is ok. The service is ok but since it's too crowded at lunch, we need to wait for the staff to attend to us each time. Overall the it's ok but nothing special
2
Came for lunch and ordered the classic Chicken Rice but the chicken tasted stale and dry, so didn't finish the meal. Service was equally slow. Will not visit this place again
5
What a place - the best laksa I have ever eaten, Char Kway Teow that's just loaded with yumminess, chicken rice and the most amazing coconut ice cream. Come with friends so you can order all the dishes and enjoy
4
Having read the mixture of reviews, had our first visit and felt the service and quality of food was good. The lobster laksa was v tasty as was the salted egg chicken wings! Of course the price is on the top side but good ambiance and decent service so am rating it a positive experience!
1
Service-They placed my friends and I, 4 in the group, at the table directly in the centre after the reception. 3 of us came early and one was coming after his IPPT test in the evening. There were many empty tables but yet the table they gave was right in the centre of a crowded section. Didn't offer another chair or something to place our bags. Air con was like non existent and servers were like fresh attachment students. The seasoned staff were like serving in other sections. No water top ups. Servers were hard to find. The captain herself, was inside the non functioning service area arranging stuff, no wonder the wait staff were all disappearing. I noticed them bunching together talking at the back of another section.Food- Chicken rice this time, felt as though it was prepared much earlier. The chicken was limpid and didn't even have any taste. I felt slightly unwell after eating the cold limpid chicken that I DIDN'T FINISH the dish. Location- Between orchard and somerset train station.Value- For a established hotel dining place, the overall experience was very bad. Never go on a weekday, perhaps all the experienced staff were off
3
There were times when the place used to serve one of the best chicken rice in Singapore. Over the years the price & quality have gone in wrong directions.Price has gone up & quality has gone down. While I do not expect the price to go down, bare minimum expected is that quality should remain consistent or go up.Which is not the case here. Planing to give this place a ski
3
Like many reviewers here, I was here many years ago before the hotel was renovated. The chicken rice was famous then, it's somewhat still famous now. Boon tong kee is now as good and cheaper The decor is kind of blah but the local menu is interesting . They charge you $20 or $30 for local food but you get premium ingredients - lobster in laksa for example I had the chicken rice. It was ok , maybe even good. The service is very good though
3
You can try out better Chicken Rice outside with a 'reasonabler' price in a better Singaporean atmosphere neighborhood.
Its still nice, but you hv to prepare yourself with a shock when you pay the bill, haha!
3
Undoubtedly the most overpriced place for local food. You are paying for the rent and reputation. Good for entertaining foreign customers. Enjoyable but it is daylight robbery.
5
Everyone knows Chatterbox = Hainanese Chicken. They just make it so deliciously over there. The Lobster Laksa was good too. A little bit on the spicy side so if you think you won't be able to take so much, it's worth sharing.
3
Well to be honest.... Chatterbox was once great. Now it is just an average dining place. The chicken rice was so good, it beats the boon tong kee's by packaging. However the taste is declining now, not to mention that the laksa (which used to be great) has changed to become average.Well I suggest it's best to keep up the quality like it used to have
3
In its heydays it was very busy and located on the ground floor . It is now located on the 5 th level . At S$27 it would be the most expensive Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore . The rice and chicken taste average though the serving for the chillie and ginger are quite generous . Lobster laksa is quite delicious Tried and ticked off
3
In the 80's I dined at Chatterbox when it was located on the ground level. Then, the ambience was classy and relax, and their famous chicken rice was incomparable. So, when my elementary school friends suggested to meet there, I was thrilled and really looked forward to the famous Chatterbox. Last week I revisited the restaurant again after more than 30 years, I was quite disappointed. First off, the furnitures were nothing but looked dated. I was quite taken aback since I was looking for the old classy charm that I remembered. Honestly it looked like I just stepped into a food court. I can hear everything from the diners seated two tables away. Then I ordered their famous chicken rice, and of course the price has gone up quite a fair bit. When the rice arrived, I thought the serve ware looked ordinary, far from what I remembered. Alright, stopped being picky, and I dug into the rice. The rice was good, but the chicken was dry, and the soup was nothing but plain. My friend ordered a plate of rojak to share, and that was very good. Sigh, the old Chatterbox, how I miss you
5
I would be lying if i said it isn't overpriced cos it IS overpriced.You can get it cheaper and better elsewhere BUT, i always enjoy my visits as the food is still really yummy!Great for business lunches bringing clients trying local food especially for the 1st time.Lovin the Hainanese Chicken rice & Laksa :
4
Reputedly one of the best Hainanese Chicken Rice joints in Singapore, this is a bit of dreary step back in time for sure..but the delicate broth & the tricked-up chicken (shredded carrot & cherry tomatoes?...really!) deliver authentic tastes & the rice fluffy,non-greasy & delicately flavoured.  They still do it well..& so they should at a hefty $27++ !!!  I had nice glass of house red which sure hurt at $16++..so the lunch was extravagant without really being worth it..$50.60! What do YOU think
3
We were told that they have really good chicken rice which is one of the must try in Singapore. Not very impressed to be honest: the dish had an okay presentation, but didn't have any taste or flavor. Nasi goreng was a much better choice as it had some spiciness in it, and the egg on top blends really good with rice. The salad is really not a recommended dish. Waiters seem a bit tired?
3
Service- The greeter was professional and advised us that we had to wait for around 20 minutes before a table should be available. Took down our names. The waiting area was already full with about 7 others waiting. It will be better if they could take our contact and call us once theres a table, as theres no waiting area. There was a waiter who was friendly and chatted with us when we called him, over for some request.Food- The chicken rice overall is good, meat is succulent. Rice not as fragrant as it can be though. Chili and grated garlic, is fresh.My friend ate the seafood hor fun, he found that the seafood is fresh and that the dish was cooked well.We shared a plate of spring rolls. It was warm and good to eat when it arrived. After leaving it for like 10 minutes, it became not that tasty.Price- It is high for a plate of chicken rice if you compared dishes being sold elsewhere. But its sold in a hotel and its located in orchard. Seems a tad pricey though
5
We were there to celebrate dad's birthday. Dad was pleasantly surprised with a birthday cake and the staff were friendly and made us comfortable during the entire time we were there.
4
There was a rave about how good the chicken rice is here.
So we had to try them and was not let down.
The rice was fragrant and the chicken was tender and had lots of flavour to it

I like the chicken rice at Chatterbox. Reasonable price. Quick service. Restaurant very busy so it's better to make a reservation or come before rush hours.

I was on business trip and got a chance to the restaurant.
Chicken rise was great as it's the signature,
I saw this restaurant pack and other guest order the same.
Food quality very high.

I’ve tried the Chatterbox signature (Set of Mandarin Chicken Rice). The price is ~$23 USD. The taste is so so. Nothing special, worse than other hawker center, selling the Hainanese Chicken rice. At least 3 restaurants in Singapore are better than here, with ~ 10 – 50% price only.The soup is poor. Also, the staff attitude in this restaurant is very poor. We request the vacant window seats, but rejected by them with the reason of the non-window seats are still available. They didn’t open such area at 11:30am. However, they re-opened it after 5 mins when more customers came. The waiter had eye contact with me, but they didn’t offer help to change the table. I don’t believe this is a 5 star hotel

This place gets very busy so we were lucky to get their early - perhaps around 6pm - and got a table fairly quickly. By the time our food had come, there was a huge crowd of people waiting. Heard this was the best chicken rice in Singapore which is quite an ambitious claim to live up to. Perhaps my expectations were raised too high - it was perfectly tasty, but I wasn't blown away and the price was really high ($27 Singapore dollars). I think there are better value options around
5
I specifically sought out Chatterbox as i've seen 3 or 4 web pages that ranks Chatterbox as one of Singapore's best chicken rice. It did not disappoint! The chicken was moist - no bones to contend with. The sauce of the chicken itself was very delicious. They served with a generous amount of dark soy, grated ginger and chill sauce. It was also served with a bowl of soup although I did not drink that since I didn't want to feel full with soup - after all, I came for the chicken rice! I would have wanted more fresh cilantro with my chicken - it had a small piece and also I found the rice to be a bit dry. Good but dry. The accompanying 2 pieces of very fresh baby tomatoes was refreshing
3
I had the chicken rice set the other day I dined eat there during midnight The chicken was the best I had so far as it is not oily and tender. The serving was just nice and if you happen to order drinks some of them are refillable ! So you can chat your night away! However the downside is only the rice, that it was tad hard and not as fragrant as other chicken rice.however worth trying

looking for supper somewhere cosy? Try this. Their menu offers a variety of local Singaporean cuisine ranging from porridge, chicken rice, fried hokkian noodles, etc..Porridge was really nice, unlike other cooked rice from a blender like from some fast food hokka stalls. Fried hokkian noodles combined both the yellow egg noodles and rice noodles well. Great balance of taste, not too salty, not too greasy, yet not too bland.opens until late night but last order at 10.30pm..very convenient and reasonable too

Tried the signature chicken rice. Whilst the serving was generous the chicken lack the moist and smooth texture that it is famous for. The chilli sauce so important to enhance the taste lacked the "garlic" punch and quite frankly the fragrance rice was dry and did not come up to standard. For top class "hotel" chicken rice, I would recommend the same dish from Madarin Oriental, Hong Kong; Langham Hotel, Shenzhen ; Hilton Shekou, Shenzhen and a tiny restaurant in Bunbury , Western Australia, Marlston Chinese Restaurant for the smoothest,silkiest and best chilli sauce that I have had the pleasure to taste!
4
Always been popular with chicken rice. Try their laksa too. Expensive but great taste. One bowl of laksa here is equivalent to 10 bowls from those local eateries. Worth trying. Good selection of wines and teas.
5
Excellent and authentic food in a comfortable environment, will make this a regular stop when we are in Singapore!

Prices are high for local food at Chatterbox. I refused to order the chicken rice costing $27 ++ per portion. Nasi Goreng seldom goes wrong at coffee houses and that was what I ordered. Location is tucked in another corner of the building so it's sad to see a former talk- of-the-town hotel cafÃ© losing its lustre during its heydays

Visited this place twice to give it a second chance but still a let down .First visit was at night 35 mins before closing we were rushed and constantly reminded they were shutting soon , second time I ordered the well known signature chicken dish but we ordered a starter first , main courses came out first we sent it back whilst we waited for our starter and I think our mains were just left on the side as when they arrived they were cold , I sent mine back and ten minutes later was presented with another , chicken now warmish but tough couldn't eat it , staff disappeared and wouldn't give me any eye contact at all ! Mentioned when paying the bill they wouldn't see us again didn't care gave me a form to fill in and knocked a coffee and Coke off the bill - Gee Thanks for nothing !

Your friends will all tell you to be sure and have the traditional Singapore chicken and rice and Chatterbox is one of the best for this dish. The chicken is simmer in a flavored stock and then served with a bowl of rice, assorted dipping sauces and a bowl of the broth. Enjoyable, but I am not convinced the dish is worth the price even when as nicely done as at Chatterbox. Very noisy with many Chinese families there to to enjoy this traditional dish along with other offerings. Expect a small wait, especially if you arrive in a group.

For those of you accustomed to visiting Singapore you know that everything is overpriced - but I just left a dinner at Chatterbox that has my head spinning - not only for the price but for the lack of quality... Tonight we had their signature dish - chicken and rice along with the lobster laksa - the lobster was passable but the chicken and rice was awful - not even warm, chicken was poor quality and bland, and the rice was ok but nothing great - I choked down my meal only because I used all of the chili to deadenb my taste buds - my friends lobster dish was barely warm but had ok taste - but nothing to justify the incredible price! Honestly - there are SO many better places to go now in Singapore - take a taxi and enjoy a real restaurant - and don't settle for poor food in the "hotel" district.... I paid $170 SGD for two dishes and a bottle of horrible wine - save your money it's not worth it...
5
simply the best. their hainan chicken rice is second to none. Even bought a couple bottle of their sauce back after the visit. Worth it always. Could try the coconut dessert too. Fail to try any other dishes there though, as i always go back for the hainan chicken.
2
Came to look for Chatterbox with BF - as the last time I was there was 15 yrs ago and it is a place "see and be seen. First floor by the window -with the view of people bustling at Orchard Road. Very trendy and hype then but now it is on some 4-5th Floor (?), secluded inside hotel and with not the best view window seating. Very disappointed. Pricey, more like a high end cafe style. There are many other nice places in Spore. Sad that Chatterbox old location is gone. Will not be back. Why bother with the high price and lousy location?

Shopping in Orchard, we decide to try again the famous and expensive Chicken Rice at Chatterbox.Even after lunch (2pm), we still need to wait about 15 minutes before we could get a table.\My sons ordered the famous Chicken Rice. My wife and decide to try their white curry noodle and fried hokkien noodle.Chicken Rice is as good as before but surprisingly their noodles are equally good. Big succulent prawns and tender chicken accompanied the noodles.Worth to try though the price is on the high side, well, its hotel dining :-

Our family has been a regular of this restaurant since the mid-1990s. When we first came to the restaurant, the chicken was so tender, moist and fragrant and the rice came with a special fragrance as well. The satay was always well done. However, I would have to say that since the last 1.5 years or so, the standard of the chicken rice has dropped. We last went on Xmas Day after church service for lunch. Somehow, besides the fragrance of the rice that still remained, the chicken was not as good as before anymore. The tenderness of the meat has gone, and the fragrance is totally lost as well. Perhaps the kitchen changed the cook or the cook used a different type of chicken to cook. Service was a bit mediocre, as we had to call the waiter or waitress twice before they took our order for hot lemon tea. These days, this does not seem to be the first choice of restaurant for my family anymore, as we could get much better quality food elsewhere
2
May be have expecting too much when ordering a Cuban sandwich in Singapore. Not sure which Cuba this one was referring to, but price and quality were way out of alignment. May be better to stick to safe hotel fare.
5
The humble Hainanese Chicken Rice is really outstanding.........:) The Chicken just melts in your mouth and the chicken broth is rich and full of amazing flavour.
The chilly sauce was outstanding and you can buy a bottle on the way out
5
I stayed at the Mandarin Hotel and had a few meals here as it is very casual but the food is very good. Great variety on the menu including Western meals,
4
Still serves very good chicken rice. A great plus is you can order a good white wine to go with the chicken rice...
enjoyed the food yet again...
4
was told to go there while in Singapore for their famous Hainanese chicken rice, and the chicken was moist a d tender and the taste was really nice. Service is a bit coffee shop style and not very friendly, and its a bit on the pricy side
4
This was our first visit to this pleasant, casual restaurant on the 5th floor of the Mandarin Hotel. The menu includes a good variety of dishes with both Asian and Western entrees. The grilled salmon and the tofu claypot we ordered were delectable. We were a bit disappointed, however, at the mediocre service. It certainly didnâ€™t live up to Mandarin Hotel standards, and there are many other fine restaurants for customers to choose from in the Mandarin Gallery
5
Chatterbox is famous for their Hainan chicken rice, but I must say their Laksa is top as well. If you haven't tried it, you must. The choice of other local dishes is very good here; and though I'm sure the other usual coffee shop fare must be good, I've never tried it as one always eat local when in Singapore
3
The food has always been nice here. Been to chatterbox many times and always love this place. However, like most good restaurants service at some places do seem not able to catch up or maintain.I asked for coffee after my chicken rice meal. The waitress came back with the coffee and put in the centre of the table. I'm just wondering if that was a soup for sharing and why can't they cleared the chicken rice and place the coffee in front of the guest?One of older lady who seems to be the senior has no smile and put up a really stern face when she brought us in. Didn't even offer if you need an additional chair for our bags. Yup. This is what makes a dinner less enjoyable with such standards around. People who begin to lose the passion and forget the true professionalism in their line of work. Sa

I had the lobster laksa. The gravy was thick and delicious, that is if you enjoy the rich taste of coconut and laksa leaves. The lobster was sweet and tender, did expect it to go so well with laksa. Also had the free flow hot soybean milk with a choice of it being served, hot, warm or cold. It's nice, flavorful and not too sweet. Certainly will return again, probably to try their famous chicken rice.
4
Back here at Chatterbox after several years to try their ever famous chicken rice. It did not disappoint me. The chicken was tender, the rice came out warm and not too oily. This comes at a cost of S$27.00++, I feel it is pretty reasonable for hotel pricing. Also ordered their free flow home-made barley at S$9.00++. It's not too sweet and comes out nice and warm. The staff is friendly and the ambience is nice. The tables are nicely spaced apart for private conversations. I will definitely come again.
5
Still serves great chicken rice after so many years. Standards still remains consistent over the year. :)
5
Lovely restaurant in the Mandarin Hotel. We went to try the chicken and rice based on a resident's recommendation and were not disappointed. The food was very tasty and high quality. Service was pleasant and timely. The air conditioned facility was most welcome.
5
Rarely had anything else than the famous chicken rice there. A bit pricey but worth it. Delicious other local fare. Ambiance quite modern. Busy place at peak hours.
4
This restaurant is excellent for breakfast, offering a huge variety of Western and Asian dishes. The service is friendly and efficient and I would definitely recommend eating here even if you are not staying at the Mandarin Orchard.
4
I've been having chicken rice at Chatterbox for more than 2 decades. Love the way the chicken meat was prepared. Sauce is light, yet flavorful. High end chicken rice, no frills. Comfortable dining environment. Will try their laksa next time.
3
The famous Hainan Chicken Rice of Mandarin Orchard, I came with too high expectation and had it with disappointment.The chicken is soft and not much taste. The sauce for the chicken as flat... In the contrary, the rice was good.The price is several times more expensive then a normal restaurant
3
I dined here during lunch time.We ordered chicken rice and cha kwe tiaw with soya bean milkThe chicken rice was okay,nothing to shout aboutTheir cha kwe tiaw is not really good,too oily.The taste of soya bean milk is good.Service was quick and efficientPrice about 20-30sgd for each mea
3
The restaurant is located at the far end of the main lobby. Area is not big but with lots of daylight. Choice of Food for lunch is not much though there are Asian and western food available. Taste of the food and service are considered average as a five star hotel. I prefer to go downstair restaurants at the shopping levels of same building where there are more choices
4
There are so many places where you can enjoy chicken rice in Singapore. My Singaporean friends have his/her choice. I've had dozens of chances to eat chicken rice when I lived in Singapore but at the end of the day, my top pick is Chatterbox. Yes, it's not cheap. But, if you are traveling, you don't want to waste your time/money choosing the wrong place. In addition, Chatterbox serves other local food which are decent. Suitable for dinner occasion as well - they have Tiger beer and wine
3
The famous Chicken Rice had slightly dip. The aroma of the chicken rice is not as strong as it used to be. The chilli was not ground finer to give a smooth texture this also goes for the ginger.The steamed chicken was tender and tasty. The bite into the chicken meat was a bit tender, a slight toughness may be bette
3
I went there with some friends from foreign country. We all ordered the signature chicken rice. The rice was too much for girls and the taste is just average in Singapore. The price is too expensive to its quality.
5
The chicken rice is a must. Whether its your first time or if you are a chicken rice connoisseur, this experience must be on your bucket list!
5
Although I admit the price of the chicken rice its expensive but it's tastes good and worth the value. Like the texture of the chicken.
4
The best Hainan chicken rice places in SG are not in comfy A/C restaurants. But if you want A/C comfort in a nice relaxing, civilized environment, this is a good place to go.
4
Yummy Hainanese Chicken Rice! My go-to restaurant for Chicken Rice - national dish of Singapore, I think.
I enjoyed the set with rice and soup. Chicken was tender and service was good. Miss this place and hope to go back again soon.
4
Had a dish with chicken, prawns and noodles in a white curry soup. Spicy and delicious. Staff was very nice and service was good.
4
I have been coming here for years, but the latest makeover turned it from a restaurant into more of an upmarket canteen. The famous chicken rice still tastes good but the edge was taken off it when the founding chef left. And prices have risen! Other local fare like Char Kway Teow is good
4
Really sensational Lobster Laksa enough for two. But other dishes are not as good: their “signature dish”, Chicken Hainan, is nothing special in my taste. But we still come back here during every visit to Singapore to have the Lobster Laksa. To die for. And its fun that each customer ordering the Laksa gets a napkin tied around their neck
4
This is one of the relatively new establishments in Karachi. I understand they have more than one outlets, I visited the on khayaban e shujat a few times. Loved the decor. It is a great place for coffee, light food, a leisurely breakfast or a dessert. I have tried it for all of these and found the place excellent. Service is very good
4
A must-go restaurant for Asian food lovers. Their Mandarin Chicken Rice Is the best chicken rice we have ever tried in Singapore. Their Lobster Laksa is a deluxe version of the traditional seafood laksa. Reasonable price for a restaurant in a 5-star hotel. Need some improvement in their service as the number of staff in the restaurant may be inadequate when the tables are fully occupied
2
Chicken rice is average. Not in line with the price. The lobster Laksa is below average. The rest of the local dishes are satisfactory but not for the price they are charging. Go to a hawker stall !
4
Came here for dinner. The quality of Hainan Chicken Rice has improved since few years back.
Services of the staff are good and sincere.
4
Had to try this famous Singapore chicken rice. Portion is quite huge. Rice is aromatic and not too oily. Just nice and the chicken was rather soft and tender. As we were staying in this hotel, therefore we just had to try out their chicken rice where everybody was raving about it. However, I personally felt it's a bit overpriced although overall was good. Service was good and food came out rather fast eventhough the occupancy was about 90% at that time where it just took us less than 15 mins to have the food on our table.

Our hotel's concierge recommended Chatterbox to us, as we were going to be in the Orchard Rd area. The restaurant is like a really nice 'Kopi Tiam' or coffee shop style place abutted to the Mandarin Orchard hotel. I had the chicken rice that everyone raves about, the kids had satay, fried rice and wonton noodle soup, spring rolls and my husband ordered Nasi Goreng. The service was very good and attentive and the food and drinks came quickly. The staff were also very friendly and charming.The chicken satay was really good but the rice cake which accompanied it was not as good as I've had in other places. The Nasi Goreng was okay but with a strong aftertaste of the shrimp paste they had used to fry it with. It was a bit disappointing.I must say that I did enjoy my chicken rice. The chicken was soft and tender and the rice was tasty and not oily. However, it was not the best that I have had.The kids fried rice was much better than the Nasi goreng but overpowered by the amount of spring onion used. The wonton noodle soup was excellent! The wonton mee was perfect and the soup delicious. Even more so were the flavoursome prawn wontons.....we had to ask for a few more as the kids just wolfed them down. If you are looking for some local food without having to venture too far, this place is good. The reason for the 3 star rating is that it is way overpriced. They charged $9 for a small glass of milk, and the total bill at the end was more than we paid at The Line at the Shangri La, where the food quality was far superior. (We didn't even have any alcohol!)However, convenience is the key word here. Local food in a nice environment after a hard days shopping. Would recommend if you are not put off by the prices.
3
Went there for lunch and while the service was really great, the chicken rice was a bit disappointing. The chicken was juicy even though I ordered the breast. However the taste was really bland. The rice itself was alright. Not as oily as some stalls which is great
3
Although this place is well known for their chicken rice, it is not the usual place locals go to satisfy their craving for the signature local dish and it is not difficult to see why. Popular with overseas guests who want to be served the local dish in a convenient location and nice environment, the dish is overpriced and overrated. There are many better options out there. Only because my date insisted. Never again
2
While the restaurant may be known for its chicken rice, other items on the menu are poor relations to the great food available elsewhere in Singapore - beef kway teow was a bit bigger than you would find in a local food stall but at 5 times the price. The ambience, service etc does not justify the price premium
2
this has been the iconic restaurant in town if you crave for local street faresadly the standard of food has plummetedthe famed chicken rice was soggy blandthe fabled char kway teow was missing oomphthe same goes for sea food hor fun, tahu gorengwe ordered wine - house pour was S$80-per bottle of plonk chardonnayanything else was a 20 to 30 minutes waitso - not a place to drink winechatterbox is probably a victim of its own success- after 40 year or so, it is not a surprise- for locals - it is not any more a destination, except late at night and pushedi hope they get their act together soo
3
I used to dine in this restaurant every time when I visited Singapore many years ago. The restaurant was located downstairs in the hotel. It served the best chicken rice then. My Singapore friends told me that the quality of this place had gone down substantially. I went there again last week, I was disappointed. No more silky succulent chicken, no more fragrant rice with chicken oil. The chicken I had was quite bland and fibrous. I do not think I will go again.
4
By far the most popular dish at the Mandarin Orchard Hotel's Chatterbox is the Chicken Rice. Not cheap but consistently satisfying. Other local favorites include the Singapore Hokkien noodles, and the Laksa with Lobster. The high standard of local fare, is not matched by the interiors which looks very bland and lacking character. Service is efficien
4
In Mandarin Orchard, you do not need to book the reataurant for Maritus Club members. You feel exclusive and taste the history of Singapore in foods. Chiken Satay is also amazing.
5
Whilst staying in Singapore one of the many places we ate at was Chatterbox which is in the Mandarin Orchard Hotel. Reasonably priced food and the Spring Rolls are to die for.
4
This location has the best tradition chicken rice set in Singapore, for 30 some years I've coming back for memorable taste. If you come visit Singapore, this is a must come location. Don't stay at the hotel, just come for the food. Their Seafood Laksa and coconut ice cream must be on your list as well, you'll not be sorry

My wife and I visited Singapore recently. We stayed at the Mandarin Orchard Singapore, where the “Legendary home of the Mandarin Chicken Rice” is their Chatterbox restaurant. On the way from Changi airport to the hotel the chauffeur of our limousine informed us that the hotel’s Chicken Rice was considered to be the best in Singapore. We decided to try the dish together with our two guests, both Singaporeans whom we have not seen for almost four decades. It was a Sunday and the restaurant was packed. This dish was certainly the best selling item on the menu as can be seen from the large number of customers consuming it. We all enjoyed the dish but agreed that its quality did not live up to its legendary status. We also had two side dishes and two bottles of wines. The side dishes were stir-fried bean shoots with salted fish and stir-fried bok choy. Both dishes were delicately flavoured and wholesome. The food service was good and the Chicken Rice was on our table within thirty minutes. The side dishes came about ten minutes later. Unfortunately, the wine service was atrocious. The person in charge of wine sales did not seem to know much about wine. We decided to celebrate our reunion with a good quality French wine. My wife preferred a white and our guests a red, so we decided to order two wines. Two French wines were being promoted that day but the wine waitress could not provide any sensible information about them. Furthermore, she was not familiar with the wines on the wine list and did not know what wines were or were not available in the restaurant’s wine cellar. I ordered a French white and a French red from the wine list. It took the wine waiter a long time to return but only to tell us that the vintages as shown on the wine list were not available. I then asked if other vintages of the same wines were available. She went away to have another look and after a long interval she came back to inform me that no other vintages were available. I then decided to order two non-French wines from the Antipodes – a cool-climate Riesling from Australia and a New Zealand Pinot Noir. When the Pinot Noir wine was brought to the table, it had a different vintage year on the label. To avoid further delay in having our wines, I finally settled on what was available. By the time our wines were poured – almost an hour from the time we arrived at our table, we had almost finished our food. Nevertheless, we consumed the wines without food over the next two hours while reminiscing about old times.The total food and wine bill came to SIN$348.00, of which 17% ($52.39) was for Services charge and GST. The prices of the wines were $90.00 for the white and $80.00 the red. We scored 7 out of 10 for the Mandarin Chicken Rice, side dishes 8/10, food service 7/10, wine service 3/10 and ambience 7/10. I was reliably informed that wine was quite a popular alcoholic beverage in Singapore and many of the locals consumed wine. Certainly, the latter was not the case at the Chatterbox as hardly any local customers within the range of my eyesight (about 20 tables around mine) were drinking wine. The inability of a five star international hotel like the Mandarin Orchard to provide good wine service was disappointing. Perhaps the employment of a trained sommelier could improve the situation
5
I have tried other famous chicken rice establishments such as "tian tian" and "boon toon kee" and chatterbox is by far the BEST Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore albeit pricey at about SGD 30 vs hawker stalls at about SGD 5. I would recommend all my out of town guests to try this.
4
As far as i remember, traveling to Singapore, this is the restaurant that served chicken rice in its unique set up with all the sauces placed in a compartmentalized dish, the clear soup and boneless chicken pieces laid perfectly in a boat shaped dish. This presentation has been copied all over in restaurants serving chicken rice in Singapore. For you guys out there who are visiting for the first time, you have to try this dish. It sounds simple until the chicken, rice and a bit of each of the sauces hit your palate... You'll never be the same again!! It was a dish that I craved and wanted as soon as I landed in Singapore, no matter what the time was I would make it a point to head right there from the airport. For the uninitiated, I would pay hotel restaurant price for this dish ( which admittedly could be had for much less elsewhere ) as it is the original chicken rice. Chattrebox also serves a mean beef hor fun ( flat noodles) and tow suan ( dessert made of steamed tender yellowish beans in a sweet broth served with a churro like breadstick). Highly recommended for the total chicken rice experience
4
This restaurant serve really delicious chicken rice. If you look around in the restaurant, many chose to order the chicken rice. Also, they serve varieties of local food like curry, nasi lemak, laksa and many more. However, it is quite pricey. So if you want to impress any foreigner boss, chatterbox is the right place to bring them.
4
My wife and I basically have to visit chatterbox when we were in Singapore. We ordered Lobster Laksa, Cha Kwee tiau, ice chendol. All the foods are of excellent quality albeit on the pricy side. Basically if you don't have much time to visit your favorite hawker stalls than this is the place to visit..

Singapore's Hainanese chicken rice restaurants can be as divisive as football teams are in some parts of the world. So be prepared for a brusque argument should you ever prefer one over the rest.But while the quality of some restaurant's chicken rice can be a little hit-and-miss, and the service a tad brusque at times, Chatterbox has been consistently excellent over the years.Prices are higher (quite a bit higher) than elsewhere but that is only to be expected for first-class service in a five-star hotel coffee shop. But the ends justify the means, especially its signature poultry dish.Chatterbox's Hainanese Chicken Rice is outstandingly good. The chicken pieces are mouth-wateringly succulent and the rice beautifully aromatic. The chilli sauce, which defines any chicken rice, is as good as I have had anywhere. Not better - just as good. But the ensemble of chicken, rice and condiments is elegantly presented as an inviting meal for one.Unlike other establishments, Chatterbox rarely runs out of chicken. So whether it is a quick lunctime nosh, a leisurely evening dinner or a bit of late-night guilty pleasure, Chatterbox is poultry in motion
5
So far, this was my best experience of my favorite Hainanese chicken rice. Straight from the airport, I took my daughter here for a late dinner. I've heard raves about this place and they did not disappoint. Yes quality does come with a price though but it's worth every dollar.I would come back again on my next visit
4
The hainanese chicken is indeed good! Too crowded! The food is not delivered at the same time so I had to wait for my husbands food while my meal had become cold already.
3
nothing special for the chicken rice...... taste just so so...but they sell at very nice package.... at 5 star hotel ..... ths make the chicken rice popular
4
very friendly staff, great coffee and a great breakfast buffet. Great way to start the day! very friendly kitchen staff
4
Went there for dinner with friends on Sunday. Located very elegant prace. Stuffs are smaily and attentive. We ate traditional chicken rice,salad and fried chicken wings. It was most elegant chicken rice that I've eaten in my life. Price is quite high but it's worth to try. I noticed that chicken rice is not only hokker center but also elegant restauran
4
drop by for lunch, the last visit was more than 10yrs back. Even before the renovation , those were the days where their chicken rice are the standard in Singapore. Order the renown dish chicken rice and white curry noodle. the chicken was great but chilli and rice standard drop, I remember the nice smell when the dish was serve but now no more. Chilli was hot but now was plain. I like the white curry noodle, not oily but like soap. Overall experience was good and staff are attentive to our needs. will visit again.
4
Chicken Rice is the best dish.. the taste a aroma is just so awesome, I crave for that dish so much ,the coconut ice-cream is also very good the flavour and taste is like heaven. can eat it even after the tummy is full!! just love them both
5
Despite the rave about places like tian tian and other such hawker stores, my wife and I went on the hunt for Singapores best chicken rice and agreed unanimously that this was clearly the best.Sure its a bit pricey but the taste, presentation and service was sublime.Will come back again!
4
When there just for their Coconut Ice Cream simply wonderful. It is their speciality serviced in a baby coconut topped with chocolate dust and a chocolate square. Our Singaporean friend took us there as a treat, my wife and I will go back there for a second time. Even the inner white coconut was sweet and tender.I'm not a lover of coconut but this coconut ice cream has changed my mind, give it a go it's a must

On the recommendation of a friend who said it served the best traditional Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore, we strolled up Orchard Road to find the Chatterbox Restaurant in the Mandarin Orchard Hotel.It was Christmas Eve, and Singaporeans were heavily engaged in the commercial side of the festival with streets crowded with shoppers and Christmas carols and popular songs blasting out of almost every shop we passed.Getting into the shopping spirit, we were rather late for lunch, but that did not seem to make any difference because after winding our way down a couple of corridors (the actual restaurant is a little hard to negotiate once within the Mandarin Orchard complex) we were quickly shown to our places.The table overlooked the busy Orchard Road and it was a pleasant feeling to relax and feel apart from the teeming throngs below. The chicken rice was everything our friend had raved about — succulent, flavoursome and well presented — it is easy to see why this dish has been the best-selling item on the restaurant’s menu since it opened 44 years ago. But there was a final treat in store: For dessert, coconut ice cream with lychees, served in half coconut shells, meaning we could scrape out the coconut flesh for a few final mouthfuls. It was an outstanding a finale

This restaurant was booked for a friends birthday and going away meal. It was the first time I had been here and it really is a big disappointment. Everybody said it is the best for local food but in reality it is just a big ripoff, bit like Newton Food Centre compared to Maxwell.. The food was OK but nothing special, I already know a beer at Mandarin Orchard is ridiculously expensive even for a hotel but 14 dollars for a can of tiger, come on... Each dish is also so overpriced, I know they have to cover expensive rental costs but this really is not worth a visit. They don't even give you the service you are paying for. Our four meals all came out at different times with about 15 minutes in between, the staff were difficult to get hold of without picking something up and throwing it at them. We even had a surprise cake for the birthday person and a staff came over and said to everyone when would you like the cake !!!! Anyway all I can say to anyone who wants to try local food, don't waste your money and go there as it isn't good and you get no benefits for paying more

I stayed at the Mandarin Orchard so had breakfast at the Chatterbox each morning. Fantastic buffet. Loved the belines! Was told that the Chicken and Rice was their signature dish. It was amazing. Would definitely have next time I am in Singapore.

Good menu, mix of local and international choices. Service is friendly and timely. Connected to Mandarin Orchard so you can charge to your room.

Famous chicken rice fix. The place has done the chicken rice to perfection for the last 30 years I have been visiting the hotel. Granted the venue has changed a few times, the chicken rice is still great. A must try for people not familiar with i

I heard that chatterbox is famous for hainanese chicken rice. however, I do not think that it is delicious as I heard and expected. The price is a bit expensive when we compared the quality with the price. However, many people have been there. you should make a reservavtion before you go
4
Our first time been to this restaurant, very friendly and professional service. We ordered their signature dishes which is the hainanese chicken rice. Although it's a bit pricy, but the portion is quite generous, and it is very tasty chicken rice. We ordered seafood hokkien mee... Again it taste very delicious, the noodle is very soft and melt in your mouth
4
The chicken rice here is recommended by Singapore Tourism Board years ago, the chicken is tasty and tender. Portion is good tho the price is high at S$28Try seafood laksa (the other signature lobster laksa is not available due to supply) as well, its soup is full of seafood and coconut favor
4
Chatterbox Café has local and International cuisine. The Chicken Rice set meal was good and the new dish of Spicy Fried Baby Squid is recommended. Service at this café can be stretched during meal times, one has to be patient for a meal. Staff are generally friendly. A nice café to have lunch or dinner with friends with local favourites a big hit
4
I came here because of the lobster laksa that my friend was raving about. It did not disappoint me but I still prefer the SICC laksa. We ordered the chicken rice and the rojak which was very very good! The dessert, chintang and the gula Melaka were very good.

In the 4 days we stayed in Singapore we had 3 meals with Hainanese chicken rice. The Chatterbox inside Mandarin Hotel at Orchard Link used to serve one of the best chicken rice I ever tasted from the mid eighties up to the early 2000. We visit the restaurant at least 2 times every time we visited Singapore. The boneless chicken was tender, juicy and flavored. The rice was filled with the fragrance of pandang leaves Ever since it moved to the 5th floor of the Hotel Arcade, the dish can only be considered as a signature dish claimed by the restaurant more than it is a fact in reality. For more than 30 Singaporean dollars including tax and service charge, the chicken is rather bland if you do not dip it in the grated ginger sauce or chili sauce. The best one we had in this trip was at Maxwell Food Centre followed by the one at Lau Pa Sat. Both were under or around $10
3
I have not been to Chatterbox for a few years. There are less expensive and more tasty local Hainanese chicken rice elsewhere in Singapore. As well, the chef and team who started the recipe had left the hotel. This time we had to accompany our friends who insisted to have bragging rights over Chatterbox back home. I guess chicken rice not only became Chatterbox's signature dish, the restaurant itself has become somewhat iconic. Given the price and that I did not find the serving any better than its competitors (infact I found it saltish), I do not recommend international travellers to make a special trip to Chatterbox just to savour chicken rice. Do it as part of an Orchard Road itinerary. Oh....by the way....this chicken rice is very much a Nanyang (Singapore+ Malaysia) invention by the early immigrants. If you ask to order chicken rice in Hainan, China, those folks will be scratching their heads. If indeed it is offered and I heard so, that is not quite the same look and taste as Nanyang chicken rice. Haha
4
I never fail to come here for their famous chicken rice whenever I'm in Singapore. Pricey though. Another dish worth mentioning would be their lobster laksa.
4
I arrived Mandarin Orchard hotel for business meeting twice. In Chatterbox you can order famous Hainan chicken rice. It is fairly ok but I love Lasha noodle more.
4
I tried their famous Chatterbox Hainanese chicken rice and laksa. Both were excellent with clean and complex flavours that I would definitely love to have again and again.However, I am somewhat stunned at the price - 26 SGD for the chicken rice set alone. That's about 10 times as such as the Maxwell chicken rice, and about 3 times the price of casual dining restaurants which also offer similar chicken rice sets.Was it better than both? Yes. 3-10 times better? Not sure... That said, if you add in the nice ambiance and convenience of not having to queue and find your own table, it is probably worth it. Everyone has a few days where they can't be bothered going into a thirty minute queue at a hot hawker centre for some chicken rice.

This restaurant caters to the late night goer and who experience hunger pangs in the middle of the night. Open from 10am to 1am on Sundays to Thursdays, and 10am to 2am on Fridays, Saturdays and eve of public holidays, you can be sure that you won’t go hungry if you need a quick fix. The lobster laksa is my favourite choice everytime I go there. But I also know that there is a very generous serving of coconut milk which isn’t very heart healthy. Lobster pieces fill the laksa which makes it worth it. My dining partners went for the chicken rice and hor fun. The chicken rice is quite standard, but it comes with a dish of vegetables and condiments. My favourite is the mashed ginger which gives the oomph to the chicken rice. The hor fun is pretty standard and you can get something similar for half the price in a coffee shopService wise most of the waiters / waitresses (less the newer ones) are well versed with all the food offerings on the menu and can explain to you what goes into each dish. Some flexibility is also given if you need to alter the dish slightly but they will usually check with the chef to see if it’s possible or requires an additional charge. Layout wise, tables and seats are well spaced apart and you won’t go bumping into another seat or fellow patron while walking to your table. More than that, you won't be overhearing your neighbour's conversation or need to raise your voice to drown him out in order to make yourself heard at your table. This place is ideal for conversations over the table. Prices are not cheap though. A soya bean milk will set you back SGD9, and that’s not including GST and service charge. Needless to say, the rest of the dishes are all priced well above what you can get a the local hawker centre. The most worth would be the lobster laksa for the price paid. Fruit drinks are available and I usually go for the soursop juice which is packed with vitamin C and not such a common drink in your usual hawker centre. Guests staying in the Mandarin Orchard hotel must at least visit this restaurant once if they have never been to a traditional hawker centre, to savour the flavours of Singapore. Be prepared to pay more than SGD30 for a decent meal with a drink. Will certainly make a beeline for chatterbox when those hunger cravings set in late night again

This restaurant has been recommended to me by many Singapore visitors and I finally got to go there and try the House Speciality - Hainan Chicken Rice. People have raved about it for years and I could see why, the food was great! It is located on the 5th Floor of the Mandarin Orchard Shopping Gallery and whilst it isn't the most romantic place to go for a meal it wins hands down on quality. We had the House Special with Bean Sprouts and I must say it was very tasty, unfortunately I couldn't eat it all as there was way too much what with the side dishes that come with it.If you are going to Singapore this restaurant is worth a try just to try the House Speciality
4
I had a lunch meeting at Chatterbox last week and decided to try something different this time, a friend recommended the Lobster Laksa...and so i did...The taste of the gravy was good and thick..however the Lobster meat was over cook...such a waste...it could have been perfected...overall service was pleasant...lots of interns working there.

Chatterbox had always been the restaurant I looked for whenever I craved for a quick meal of chicken rice while in Singapore. So I went back this time again after being absent from the island country for 3-4 years.The restaurant had been relocated to the upper floor of the shopping mall from ground floor, and service area seemed to be smaller but elegantly set and well managed. Reception and waiting staff had been very attentive, efficient but not intrusive. My chicken rice was served not long after order was taken. Presentation was excellent with all things served in an integrated tray. However nice things stopped here! Rice was on the dry side with a rather bland taste instead of the usually shiny rice with rich flour of chicken and herbs and spices I used to have. Chicken meat was dry and tasteless, gone was the succulent and juicy chicken that I had always been craving for. And the high price of SGD30/USD5 was not justified in any way. Alternatively chicken rice at TIAN TIAN in Maxwell Food centre is among the best choice nowadays at a mere SGD5. Hope management of Chatterbox would investigate and see what happened to restore the long held reputation of being the standard of chicken rice in Singapore
4
Centrally located on orchard, this place is legendary for its Hainanese chicken. I'm not a fan of this dish, but I have to admit that it was more succulent, yummier, and cleaner-tasting than others. Many people will never leave Sing without the requisite meal at Chatterbox
5
Last Christmas (2013) we vacationed in Singapore and was told by a good friend that the best authentic chicken rice was at this restaurant. At first I was skeptical since this was in a 5-star hotel, but was proven wrong. The chicken was cooked just right, juicy and flavorful and was accompanied by equally flavorful rice and clear soup. It was also the first time I ate chicken rice with other sidings outside of just the soup and rice. Admittedly it was pricey compared to most chicken rice in Singapore but any enthusiast of this dish should try this at least once
5
Usually if you try hawker food you either have to wait in line, no air conditioner and associated with stalls or outdoor. Here at mandarin hotel in orchard, you can experience most of the hawker food at a very good and comfortable place. Their popular Chicken rice is must, and beef satay is really good and laksa, beef Kwetiauw and pork rib soup are the dishes that please me. You have ice Kacang and Cen Teng for the desert
4
We tried the signature dishes - chicken rice & lobster laska. They all did not let us disappointed. The taste of rice is even very delicious too. Besides, we also ordered saydai and they are yummy too. However, the price is a bit expensive.
1
Ordered 2 glasses of coke with the price of 20 SGD excluding service charge and GST. Most people will assume that the price of drink would be normal and order it without looking at price.
4
Thumbs up for the signature dish of this restaurant! Picture already tells everything, go and try for once :)

By far, the fanciest Chicken Rice I’ve ever eaten in Singapore is at Chatterbox at the Mandarin Orchard. Went here with a group of 6 on a Tuesday night, and was seated in a booth close to the entrance. Chatterbox is famous for its Chicken Rice, which according to the website is an “award-winning Mandarin Chicken Rice, a household name and the best-selling item on the menu since the restaurant opened in 1971.”They give you an option of white or dark meat, and the dish is served with savory soup and a triplet of condiments. To be honest, I can’t tell the difference between this Chicken Rice and the one I had at Maxwell Hawker Center… which is to say, they are both amazing. The big difference is that the one at Chatterbox costs 5x. But I guess you pay for the ambiance :)And yes, they have a wine list (can't get that at Maxwell!
5
Whenever we go to Singapore, we always make sure to eat at Chatterbox (Mandarin Orchard). We arrived around 2PM, and we were given a table immediately. The service is also fast and good. All in all, we were all satisfied with our food order which included - chicken rice, nasi goreng, chicken satay, crispy chicken wings and dessert. We are definitely coming back
3
The iconic Hainanese Chicken rice at Chatterbox must be tried once. The second time it loses it's shine. I had the chicken rice before and had enjoyed it, so I brought my colleague for dinner (as he wanted to eat typical Singaporean food). The serving size was large and the meat quite tender (we had the breast piece). The accompanying soup and salad was tasty too. But there was no Wow factor. The price was very high (even for a restaurant in a 5 star hotel). Beer and side dishes were pricy too. The restaurant seating and overall atmosphere was very plain & business like and did not justify the fine dining prices. Service was efficient, attentive but impersonal

For full review & photos, please visit: http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2014/07/chatterbox-333-orchard-road-mandarin.htmlI requested for drumstick so i expected it to be very succulent and very smooth! But to my disappointment, the meat was not that succulent and smooth as what i've expected it to be.. It was not tough but was not very tender too. The light soy sauce underneath the chicken as well as the soup provided was so salty!! I was so thirsty the whole night after i had their soup and chicken rice.. The rice was quite fragrant but a tad dry. I can only say with such standard in a 5 star hotel, the price here shouldn't be $27++ = SGD32 nett (Costs around 8 times more than the market price)With such price, it should taste special and made people wow. This dish was so embarrassing to be served to tourists. Seriously it should cost $14++. You will know what i mean if you have tried those popular chicken rice stalls at famous hawker centres like Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice at Maxwell Food Centre
4
We went for the famous Hainan chicken rice and it was very good, a generous serve of breast meat and all the condiments. However it is expensive with Chinese tea an eye watering $8. It came in a lovely pot which should have been included for the price.
4
I went there around 2 pm in the afternoon, but many people still came for food. I ordered only Hainanese Chicken Rice, it actually came in a big portion. It was a brunch for me that day. First, I thought chicken meat was a bit dry. *You can choose chicken drumstick or chicken breast. Then, I tossed the chicken meat mixed with the sauce underneath, voila! it was much better. I thought chicken meat was just OK. Surprisingly, the soup was excellent. I love the ginger and iceberg lettuce. It tasted so delicate, light and scented. I could go back there again, just for the soup. The service was impressive as other good establishments. At one point, the waitress came to the window and pulled the blind down a bit after she saw me working my iPad. I always admire small gestures with great gratitude and kindness. If you have time and nearby Orchard road, maybe try this restaurant once. For me, it was one of happy quiet afternoons in Singapore :
5
I loved the chicken rice! Yes it is a bit expensive but was well worth the price! The chicken meat was lean with very thin skin, not like the ones I've had at other places where I had to remove bones and skin was sometimes thicker than the actual meat. I loved how they gave more meat than rice, as In my past experiences, I was given lots of rice with only a few pieces of chicken on top. Would love to bring friends and family for a treat next time
4
We were staying closeby and didn't want to travel to China Town to try the Hainan Chicken so walked up the Mandarin Orchard Singapore, Level 5 to experience their dish. it was delicious, healthy but a little expensive. My husband had a coconut drink, I had a diet Coke and a coconut icecream for dessert (This ice cream is to die for) plus we both had the chicken and the bill was over $100 Singapore dollars.As previous reviewers mentioned if money isn't an issue then you will enjoy it. The decor is calming and service attentive and excellent
4
The chicken rice at the chatterbox restaurant at the Mandarin orchard is very very good , just like the title above. The rice is full of flavor and aroma... Chicken portions are good. And cooked well and nice. Now comes the complaints. It's too pricey. Even for Singapore standards.. I've been coming here for more than 10 years and always complain about the price. However if money is not an issue, you have to try this excellent chicken ric
5
Decided to check out the chicken rice which they have always been well known for and chicken rice being my favorite dish decided to check out thou I have been there several times long long time ago I was never dissapointed with the quality and good portion size in fact had difficulty finishing wish I got more soup I believe I would have got it if I asked for.It wasn't cheap chicken rice set and a drink for Sgd40 plus but that will not stop me from going there once again went I back to Singapore.Well this time they have upgraded the outlet which is in Mandarin hotel.If you can afford you should treat yourself to it just like what I did
4
5 star food, let met say that straight up. Just lovely, fresh and aromatic chicken. However, I'll deduct a star for the price. I have never ever, in all my travels around the world, seen a $10 dollar coca-cola. Until I went to Chatterbox. Still great food, but I'm not sure it's quite worth the price. If money's no object though, drop in for sure
4
By the time we checked into the hotel it was almost 9pm, we wanted to grab some decent food on Orchard Road. We tried our luck and to our pleasant surprise Chatterbox was still open. However, we had to wait at least 30 minutes even at 9pm!We ordered a chicken rice, bakuteh and fried noodles. To be fair the quality and portion size were better than average, albeit totally overpriced.Overall I recommend it to first time travellers but it's not somewhere I will go all the time. Also, if there's a long line at the door, leave

I was starving in Singapore and was looking to be Wow'ed. Came to Chatterbox to try their Famous Chicken Rice. Ive read about it in magazines, heard about it from friends, and read about it online. So I decided to give it a try.Arrived a little after 5pm and it was pretty empty and there were a lot of workers just standing around. I was their 4th table and I was expecting great service since they were overstaffed. While looking at the extremely over priced menu, I over heard the people behind me asking whats taking so long for their food as they had a flight to catch, they seemed very aggravated. Anyhow I already knew i wanted to try the dark meat chicken rice, but i also wanted to get an appetizer, however nothing seemed to catch my eye. I went ahead and just ordered their signature dish as I thought for $27 its probably going to be an enormous portion.Food came extremely fast, only within minutes of ordering. First thing that came to mind was, its just a regular portion that you can get almost anywhere else. However I started to dig in since I was starving.The chicken wasn't flavorful and was not tender as dark meat should be. I waved down a waitress and asked her about it, but she assured me that it was dark meat. I took her word for it, but for this to be their signature dish, I'm not sure why everyone raves about this place. It was not special at all.The soup was good, but probably because of all the fried scallions they add into it. It would have been a lot better if it was hot instead of luke warm.The rice was probably the best part of the meal. It was just perfectly cooked to the way i like. Flavor was okay, but texture was exactly what i wanted.The service was pretty lousy actually. It took forever to get a server to place the order, my water glass was empty half way thru my meal, and it took forever to get my bill. I don't understand how or why the service was so bad, there are so many waiters just standing around and not doing anything.Chicken rice was $27, after service and tax the total came out to $31.80. Don't make the same mistake as I did and try it out. Its a waste of time and money, go down one floor and try one of the other many restaurants

I have been to this restaurant many times before, I always go away with a great feeling of satisfaction and happiness. The restaurant offer refine grade of local delicacies.I enjoyed those local items on the menu. Most recently I hosted a few visitors from USA for lunch, I have the Beef Kway Teow, so delicious and beef is tender, very easy to eat, my wife and one US friend had the Chicken Rice, so flavorful and the chili source and ginger source bring the enjoyment to the next level, Another US friend had the Laksa, he likes it instantly, considered seldom eat local food, his enjoyment is tantamount to clear endorsement of the food here.Service here mostly quite good, but may occasionally run into some new staff or temporary staff that less proficient, this is also the reflection of tight labor market situation in Singapore. For visitors to Singapore, it is highly recommended you have a meal here to bring home great memory of good local Singapore food
3
The fried Hokkien prawn mee (noodle) and roast wagyu beef sandwich were good but the rojak and 'cheng tng' dessert were average. Though rojak has more variety of fruits and vegetable than hawker centre, the quality (taste) and quantity were average for the S$18 dish. The variety of ingredients in the 'cheng tng' was good (had dried persimmon and white fungus), the taste was bland for a dessert. The barley was hard and white fungus was not tender.Our meal costs high enough to get a complimentary car parking ticket but, beware, your car park fare is not complimentary when it's more than S$6 - you have to pay the excess
1
Just because it appears in guide book and it's popular does not mean that it is good. The signature chicken rice is rather bland. Boon Tong Kee can certainly fare better. Laksa is worst. Ran out of lobster and substitute with few pieces of prawns and fish cakes. The laksa is too lemak, too thick and a tad salty. The gravy looks stale. Katong laksa can beat this hands down. If not because we have a $50 discount coupon, we won't bother going there again.
2
Just returned from dinner at Chatterbox at Mandarin hotel. Expensive for their chicken rice S$32 including service fees and GST We were shocked when we recieved our bill to realise that we were ripped off for our 2 drinks, we were charged S$11.70 (including service fees and GST) for a glass of Sprite. A glass of lime juice is also the same price at S$11.70!!!!. We ordered the drinks without looking at the menu as we assumed that prices for drinks would be normal like other restaurants. We can understand them charging a premium for their chicken rice but for drinks this is total rip off. So if you have to go there next time beware check the prices for drinks before you order.The total cost of our dinner (2 persons) 1 chicken rice + 1 Curry chicken + 2 drinsk Sprite and lime juice cost us S$83.55. A really expensive meal indeed!Overall due to this experience we did not enjoy the meal - would we go back again? - Definately N
4
This place is so strategically located near Taka shopping center. Try to get the seat facing the window. Great view. The food is delish, the portion however, is small. A bit pricey for the cost.
5
We loved this restaurant so much we went back again ! It is an institution in Singapore and the chicken rice is what they are known for and it is delicious. If we lived in Singapore we would be very frequent visitors.
4
Had chicken rice for lunch today.Not cheap but was still good thou was much better before.Serving was quite ok better be for the Sgd27 you cough out.I felt the service was little slow and went ask forcthe bill they gave it to me but wanted me to go over the entrance where the cashier was to pay that I was not too happy.Service staff I believe are quite long service especially the chinese lady waitress who just not to my mark compared to the younger wsiters yhat took my order.Might consider having chicken rice once again went I return to Singapore middle of the year
1
Im just gonna be direct to the point.1) Ordered kids meal FishnChips & golden nuggets. Charged us the adult version of fish and chips SGD14 diff2) Ordered club sandwich, 35 min later didn't come had to cancel3) asked for hot water never came.Had the nerve to charge 10% service charge
4
Its a must eat place for hainanese chicken. A must. It might not be the best, but you have to eat here. Its the foreigner's yardstick of Singaporean Hainanese chicken. Its hotel prices but at least you know its clean. Come in a little after lunch to avoid the crowd. stay awhile and enjoy the flavour. When you get home to where every you came from you will be glad you did.
3
So this place is famous for its chicken rice. Nice meals after rainy day, so conveniently located next to big shopping place. The portion is small for its price, and the price is not necessarily cheap. But, hey, location, location, location. Oh..and its coconut ice cream is also to die for
3
I admit, I am a huge fan of this place. Been eating since I was in college. But they recently remove the deep fried chicken wing that compliment nicely to the Hai Nan Chicken rice. WHY..?The price also has gone up quite a bit. I guess it pays for the nice interior décor. But quite frankly, please return the chicken wing to the menu.
3
Went with a friend who insisted, yes, INSISTED, on being taken to try their famous chicken rice. Now, chicken rice - or food for that matter, is hugely subjective and one man's meat is another man's well - garbage. Take that famous chicken rice stall at Maxwell market, half of the people who've eaten there will rave about it and the other half will say, "Oh please!" Chatterbox has built its reputation on it's chicken rice, but come on, it is now so way overpriced! Diners should perhaps try the many other options in Singapore such as the one at the Yacht Club or even the one on the 5th floor at Far East Plaza
4
This is one of my favourite cafés in Singapore.....chicken rice in cool comfort and not rushed. There are many wonderful eateries in Singapore but this has almost become an icon. Service was prompt and polite. This is important as many of Singapore 's hospitality industry appear to be replaced with staff from mainland China whose notion of hospitality and English language may not be ideal for Singapore's tourist image
4
Read many positive reviews about this place, so my objective is to try their famous chicken rice. Is it worth almost $30?? The answer is yes....because the chicken they used taste different, you can taste they use a high quality chicken. Also, the dining atmosphere is better than most chicken rice restaurant. The 3 sauces they served are brilliant, fresh and full of flavour
4
very good Hainan chicken rice meal. very nice, the rice is very fragrant. chicken is tender. the location is very close to major shopping center.
only concern is the portion...quite small for the price charged. I have to order two..lol.
overall satisfying.
4
Tender hainanese chicken is always welcome but there is always the price to consider. It's pricey and there are better hainanese chicken but you have to look for them in the streets. I was told there was one near Chinatown. :)
4
quality of food is quite good. but pricing is on the high side. lobster laksa is good. as well as it's chicken curry. spiciness just right. pricing is triple to quadruple that of hawker stalls, had no choice really as it was a late dinner and most restos were closing..
4
We dined here one night because a tropical thunderstorm prevented us from leaving the hotel. My husband had the Haianese Chicken Rice which was definitely the best we'd ever had even after several trips to Singapore. I had an Indonesian Fried Chicken dish which was also delicious. However the bill was a bit of a shock at over $100 for these two dishes, one plate of spring rolls and two beers. The (local) beers were S$14 per glass! The atmosphere and service were nothing special
3
Restaurant is famous for it's chicken rice so we ordered it despite costing double than what you'd see at hawkers. Admittedly, it is delicious, the servings are generous and since it is deboned, a pleasure to eat. However, the taste isn't very far from other stalls serving chicken rice at half the price. We also tried the lobster laksa but found it a bit tame and watered down. If you want it more authentic and cheaper, venture out of the Orchard Road area
3
I came here with a colleague, following the recommendation of an inflight magazine. Of course we ordered the chicken rice, since it's their signature dish. But we also had the satay and shrimp dumplings for starters and loved them. In my opinion, they were worth the visit much more than the chicken rice which didn't impress me so much, even though I don't really feel entitled to judge since it was my first encounter with Hainanese cuisine and I didn't know how it's supposed to be eaten. Thrown together in one bowl with all three sauces (soy, chili, ginger) it was actually nice. But if I came back it would be much more for the starters and the coconut ice cream - which was divine, served in a young coconut shell - than for the rice. I also have to say that the service was really terrible. They all looked bored, were not attentive at all, disappeared in between and took ages... And I found the design of the restaurant rather cold and not very atmospheric. And finally - this place is known for being pricey
3
Stayed at Mandarin Orchard for two nights so had 2 meals (lunch & dinner) at Chatterbox. In total, we tried the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Lobster Laksa, wagyu beef burger, hokkien mee, rojak, seasonal vegetable with oyster sauce. The chicken rice (breast meat) was dry and not succulent. I had better chicken rice decade ago at other Mandarin hotel outlets. seasonal vegetable with oyster sauce was also average. Lobster was good but the laksa has too much coconut gravy so not to our liking. The beef burger, hokkien mee and rojak were good. prices quite expensive. Service was average
3
suggested by my husband who used to live here in singapore. read in the internet that it's the "home of the hainanese chicken rice".so i headed to this restaurant and was prepared to be wowed. this is my experience:i arrived to a packed restaurant. had to wait, but luckily i got seated after about 10 minutes. the waitress promptly asked for my order. requested for their house special, the chicken rice.waited for the food for a long time. at first, i gave them the excuse that maybe it's taking a bit too long because of so many orders. but when i saw that the people who got in after me already received their food and are already eating, then i started to get a bit irked. seems like they forgot about my order, a single simple easy dish to prepare. had to ask to waiters to follow up on my food.finally the food arrived. tried it, and to be honest i was a bit disappointed. it's good, but not the best chicken rice i've had in SG. i tried better chicken rice in Newton Circus that's 9x cheaper than Chatterbox's. the restaurant's ambiance isn't even enough to compensate for the higher rate
4
I usually stay at the Mandarin on Orchard and once again had a great stay. Chatterbox is great for breakfast but also for anything from brunch to an evening meal. We ate there a few times and the chicken rice was amazing, as was the laksa - even managing to make me a chicken laksa although it wasnt on the menu. Not much of a view in some places but a great place to eat, fast and efficient service and the breakfasts are well worth it as well, particularly the "egg/omelette" chef in the mornings who manages to cheer everyone up
5
Unless you don't like Chicken, you can't skip this dishes. The chicken is juicy and soft and the source for the chicken is excellent. I've order Bat Kut Teh too, it just so so, i prefer the other brand of it. Service is very good or may be I went there at 3pm. so there's lots of seat and have good service. :
5
For a chicken rice addict like myself, this was the holy grail. Big portions, great taste and superb condiments. Do not leave Singapore without trying this place out. A little pricey, but worth every cent.
4
The Chicken Rice is tasty, The rice is full of taste of chicken oil and the meat was fresh. A restaurant with special local style food.
3
I heard so much about Chatterbox I thought I had to check this place out once I land in Singapore.The lobster laksa was really good. However, the others, such as chicken rice, were really, only mediocre.It is quite pricey too, for local food. I did not think it was any much better than the usual popular Wee Nam Kee or Boon Tong Kee's chicken rice.Highly recommend the laksa
4
We had a late lunch at Chatterbox at 2 pm when it was almost completely full of customers. My wifeâ€™s Caesar salad was very good. I felt that my coconut milk chicken curry with rice was delicious, and I recommend it. There were generous portions of chicken, and the eggplant was tasty. Service was friendly and prompt. Chatterbox competes with many other restaurants in the Mandarin Gallery. It seems a bit more expensive because it is a part of the hotel, but we felt that the food, service, and slightly longer opening hours were worth it. We were able to sign for the bill and pay on check-out at the Mandarin Orchard

Had Hainan chicken rice for lunch which was excellent. My wife had the won ton noodles and said it was great. Service was very slow and had to remind waiter a couple of times for my soft drink that I had ordered. Would recommend it for food but not if you're in a hurry. Atmosphere ok, felt more like a coffee shop
2
Had an outstanding Fish and Chips one day, subsequent visits totally over fried.Same with other dishes.Service staff are BORED.Their posture, attitude and tardiness are apparent. Even the head service staff (in a different uniform shade) share this malaise.This outlet is the MOST DRAB-LOOKING hotel cafe along Orchard Road

I stayed at the Mandarin Orchard with my business partner and his family including there 3 year old daughter. Chatterbox was the most convenient location for breakfast to get an early start. The food selection and preparation was excellent and most importantly covered the tastes of a 3 year old - fruit, juice, noodles, chicken sausage etc. I am usually not a big breakfast eater so the idea of paying over S$130 for breakfast for 3 adults would not be my preferred choice however, price not withstanding, the food and staff were great and it was very convenient and open at 8am enabling us to get an early start on the day. In fairness to Chatterbox their breakfast buffet pricing is in line with all similar quality hotels throughout Singapore and as we were on holiday I didn't mind splurging. If you are not on an early time schedule then there are some great dining options in the Mandarin Gallery below the hotel such as Wild Honey that opens at 9am.I cannot comment knowledgeably about their lunch or dinner service though I did check out their menu and decided to dine a Triple Three which was truly superb
2
I was staying at the Mandarin Orchard and they directed me to the Chatterbox as an a la carte restaurant. I was looking forward to a decent evening meal but was rushed through a very average meal with nothing more than a lunch time type menu. Most disappointing advice from a quality hotel and a restaurant with a very undeserved reputation

When you have a chance to visit Singapore, what would you like to do?Sightseeing? Shopping? Eating?One of the famous meals in Singapore is Chicken Rice and you can eat it anywhere in Singapore with reasonable price.However, it is good to have it in Mandarine Oriental Shingapore.Chatterbox Singapore is located on Level 5 of the Mandarine Oriental Shingapore with a modern and refreshing look. Chatterbox was commenced its operations in 1971 with featuring a spread of local heritage cuisines and the first hotel restaurant that made local food famous both locally and worldwide. Since we took an evening flight from Japan to Singapore, we arrived at Changi Airport at mid night.There was a car waiting for us and it took us to the St. Regis Singapore.I waked up a little late because my colleague was supporsed to pick me up just before the lunch.In fact, for the lunch, he took me this restaurant for eating Chicken Rice.It was still before mid day, the restaurant was not so crowded. We were guided to a table near the window where the lunch menu was on the table.There was Mandarine Chicken Rice at S$ 27.00 on the left side on top and we have ordered it.Mandarine Chicken Rice in this restaurant is very facmous even in Japan and it is on the Japanese tourist guidebook.As matter of fact, I heard some Japanese. In other words, there are some Japanese who were there to eat the chicken rice.About 5 minutes after we orderd, the Chicken Rice served by a waitress.It was tender boiled chicken with fragrant jasmine rice and soup complemented with homemade chilli, ginger and dark soya sauce, which you can see the pictures attached.It was delicious. Particularly eating chicken with thechilli source was good, though it is hot.Here you can enjoy eating Chicken Rice with rich mood, though expensive

I have tried various Chicken Rice shops in Singapore. Chatterbox must be one of the best in the town.I ordered the chicken rice set, this is served with boneless chicken. The chicken is quite tender and has a detectable chicken taste.The bowl of 'oily rice' is quite good, The rice in most of the chicken shop are usually too wet and also weak in flavours. In Chatterbox, the rice is fluffy and not sticking together, but it also has a good combination of Chicken Oil and Stock flavourAlthough I haven't tried many chicken rice in Singapore, so far this remains the best one I have tried in town
3
Too pricy especially their famed Chicken Rice.....get a better deal at 20% of the cost at Five Star Chicken Rice outlets
4
Everybody come here for the chicken rice, which of course is very good. But luckily, I tried their coconut ice-bream, served inside a young coconut - which was excellent!
Please try - only the ice cream is worth the trip!!!
5
I don't do much restaurant review but this is the place if you like Chicken Rice. The price is perhaps one of the most expensive in Singapore, service is not so great. But I always come back for the food. Try also the Laksa and you will come back
4
I am not a big fan of chicken rice mainly because it is oily. However trying the chicken rice at chatterbox, it is delicious! The rice portion is more than an average bowl and the rice are fragrant.The chicken portion is large too which can be share among 2 person.Overall, the rice, chicken and soup is surprisingly not oily hehe ..
1
I am a local Singaporean. Chatterbox IS NOT a good place to eat at! If you want authentic Singaporean food, there are tons of places out there with more 'original' food. The taste is not that great either. I can get the same from Ananas cafe for $2. The portions are huge, that's a plus point. Service is not fabulous either and honestly their cleanliness is not what i would expect for that price. Pizzahut is equally as clean. Nor is their service that great and about half their staff can't even communicate with you properly in english. Their coconut ice cream is worth it though. But that's it

I stayed at Grand Hyatt Singapore last year and someone recommended me to go try chicken rice at The Mandarin. I never knew how expensive it was and I decided to go. And in my opinion the chicken rice here was good but quite expensive. I loved lemon juice as well. It was nice experience to had the expensive chicken rice at The Mandarin but just once is enough. Thank yo

We decided to go for lunch here during our stay in Singapore as the Chicken Rice comes highly recommended.Firstly the chicken rice is definitely worth the try but comes with a hefty price of SD$20+. The Hainese chicken is nicely done and the portion is ample. The rice is fragrant and has a nice flavour as well. The accompanying chilli and soya sauce with ginger is a nice addition to the dish. There is a side dish as well and we opted for the bean sprouts which were very fresh and crunchy. As for the other items we were quite disappointed. We tried the char koey tiow and it was a let down. There was hardly any flavour and we ended leaving the dish uneaten. We also sampled the ham sandwich and once again it was nothing to shout about and mediocre at best.The other item that is highlighted is the Singapore Laksa with Lobster. This time around we did not try this dish but may do so on our next visit.So my personal advice, if you do decide to visit this place would be to stick to the chicken rice. I hope they do improve their other local offerings and not ended being a one hit wonder
3
We have been going to this restaurant each time we have travelled to Singapore to have their famed chicken rice. We ordered it again this time. Whilst the dish was very good, it was also at what we noticed to be a significant price - $27 ++. For what it is , it is expensive. We'll probably go again next time we are in Singapore, however, as it has become a tradition
2
We went there for dinner today. And quite disappointing with service. First, they featured a wine list that was no longer available. Not sure why it is still in their feature list.Then came the Chicken Rice. For what I paid, I could have gotten a much better tasting chicken and a whole chicken at that. Rice was dry and not moist.And it took several follow up just to get my credit card.Not returning

I went to have chicken rice in Chatterbox this afternoon, with my mom and my husband. We arrived at the restaurant at 1:45 p.m., way past lunch time, but still on waiting list. We had to wait a while for the seats. Probably because the restaurant was too busy, the waitress gave my mom and my husband warm water, instead of the cold water they ordered.  We ordered 1 dozen chicken satay, which is quite tasty, though it still cannot be compared with the satay served at Four Season Hotel.  We also ordered their famous Chicken rice (drumstick), the only complaint that I have is that the skin of the chicken is still quite oily and greasy, though we did not eat the skin.  My husband had the coconut ice cream for dessert, which was the all-time favourite. As that portion was quite big for me, I ordered a strawberry flavour ice cream instead. I only asked for 1 scoop, though they did give me a very big and appetising scope.  For the month of March, in celebration of the Prestige Award 2013 that they got for their chicken rice, my mom as a senior citizen, got 40% off the chicken rice
3
Def not worth the hype. The hainanese chicken at the food stalls are way better and way cheaper... $27 vs $4 !!!
4
I think everyone who is reading up on Chatterbox is aware of their famous chicken rice. To be honest, it is quite good but not quite worth all the chatter it has created. When i first stepped into Chatterbox, the Cafe was still located high up on Mandarin Orchard where the view was still a fantastic condiment to the meal. Since the hotel's renovation, it's now located on level 5 of the adjacent Mandarin Gallery shopping mall and gone is the view of Orchard Road (Singapore's main shopping belt). Still, the atmosphere and food is decent - my current favorites are the Bak Kut Teh (a light pork rib soup) and the curry fish. I would give the sandwiches and steak a miss though, especially for the price tag
3
I had always wanted to eat the chicken rice at Chatterbox (even though I have heard that it is no longer that nice) just so I can judge for myself whether it is indeed worth the money.It is a good plate of chicken rice, with lots of chicken and other ingredients but! Yes. BUT!! You are in Singapore and chicken rice of this quality can be had for much cheaper (albeit not in such comfy environment).The ambience was retro Singapore and the service was impeccable. I wouldn't say that it was a waste of money but if you wonder if you can have a similar plate elsewhere, yes you can definitely have a similar plate in a hawker centre.. if not better!I personally prefer my chicken more tender and the rice softer
5
We were staying at the Mandarin and decided to try their Chicken Rice to see if was as good as it had been 30 years ago.Hubby was at school there so its his comfort food !Indeed it was superb and so we then tried the Lobster Laksa, oooo heaven in a huge bowl , then Char Kue Tiau again,great.Not neglecting a bowl of Tau Suan,my favouritePrices are what you would expect in a hotel of course,but the food was really spot on.I realise that just up Orchard there are many food courts etc serving the same food,(smaller portions though),for a much cheaper price.However, not all of us like to eat in food courts and Chatterbox delivers the same authentic dishes ,which is rare for hotel fare.So if you want the delicious local foods, in a more sedate setting and do not mind paying double ,Chatterbox is where you should go again and again.Great staff to

This is one of my listed restaurants especially when I have guests from overseas who is looking for chicken rice restaurant with assurance. Located on the edge of lobby floor in Mandarin Orchard Hotel, they provide this high class signature "Chicken Rice", somewhere between 20-30 SGD per set per head. Compared to thd locally available ones, as this shop is quite expensive. But I find the benefit for us to accommodate guests' need, I would likely

Stay almost 10 years in Singapore, this is our first time visiting Chatterbox with our guest from overseas. We decided to try out chicken rice at chatterbox because for its famous most expensive chicken rice in town.The restaurant located at Superb location, Meritus hotel at Orchard road. The service is good, ambiance not bad, the portion of the rice is a lot, ginger and chilli paste is not bad, and the most important in chicken rice is the chicken. The meat is really disappointed especially the breast meat, its hard and tasteless, the chicken sauce is salty.Overall i can say compare the price with the taste is really not worth. You can find more better, more delicious and cheaper chicken rice outside just for $3 or $6 for the drumstick meat compare to $30++ at Chatterbox.IF you are looking for really nice local food, you must look for where local people eat or queue. At Chatterbox i can say 95% is a tourist, 70% is from Indonesia and i think local people is smart enough not to eat here

This restaurant offers a wide range of local Singaporean foods and a nice clear environment, if that's what you're looking for, but for a price. We had the lobster laksa and the chicken rice. The laksa was good, worth trying, but was quite expensive at $30+. On the other hand, I was very disappointed with the chicken rice. It didn't have the smooth barely cooked texture that chicken rice is meant to have. A day earlier I had chicken rice at another restaurant that was infinitely better for maybe half the price in a Marina Bay mall food court. Everyone knows that the best Singaporean staple foods are in the dingy (or not so dingy these days) hawker centers. I'd say, save your money and go to a hawker center, unless you're really obsessive about going to clean western style restaurants, but what fun is that
2
I ordered the boneless chicken rice set- & found 2 pieces of bone, each the length of an index finger in it.When I voiced out to the staff, she mentioned that it is common to find that in drumsticks & offered no apology nor any form of compensation
4
If you have been around Singapore like me, having lived there for 6 years and constantly going back almost once a month for a visit then you will agree with me that chicken rice chatterbox is just one of the best in town. But if you are not so big on the chicken rice which is actually a must try if you ever in singapore, the rest of the menu are also very very good. Not necessarily the best but i dont think you can go wrong in chatterbox. They are al safely good tasty food. The only thing i didnt like is the new place. It's not as nice as the old one was. well thats just my opinion. But the service, the taste they are all still up to their standard. So if you are looking for a go to restaurant in times of "not knowing what to eat" then this is your perfect place. Cause everything is good. Is there any other place better? of course, but you just cant go wrong with chatterbox
3
this place is famous for its chicken rice, which is a more upscale version of the typical hawker version. you will be given a generous heap of chicken, and the rice (which i hear is replenishable?) is flavourful and slightly less oily. nonetheless, it costs almost 10 times as much as a regular plate in a hawker centre
3
Good food but very expensive. Having said that the portions are large by Singaporean standards. Centrally located and easy to get to. If you are only here for a short while this might be the place you want to try Singapore's signature dish.
3
The chicken rice is just fine. I wouldn't say it's the finest I ever tasted. I think it is overrated & I tried to seach for the 'savouring' flavour that people are talking about but it wasn't there!
3
A good Place for a snack during a shopping expedition. It's a little busy but if you're patient, and relaxed it's ok.
2
I am sorry that I personally think that the price was slightly over, with so-so food quality and taste.
SD20 ++ can be spend on many other better food? Again no offend that I wonder why the restaurant is crowded with customers during lunch hour.
4
Yes, the signature dish (chicken rice) is so expensive, compare with others places in Singapore. Apart from the food, its environment and service are good also. So, it is worth to try once.
3
I didn't try their special, which is Hainam Chicken Rice, and ordered steak instead. It wasn't good at all so maybe I should have chosen Chinese food from a Chinese restaurant. So don't order their steak! Drink selection is acceptable though.
5
Located on the 5th floor of Mandarin Orchard Hotel.
A bit pricey for chicken rice, but it would not let you down!
3
On my first day, i decided to give this restaurant a try since this is in the lobby of our hotel. As a vegetarian with occasional seafood ingredients in my food, i ordered tofu and vegetables in rice for SGD20++. The food wasnt big, and it wasnt as good as ive expected either for that price i paid. The tofu and mushrooms were fine, my concern is that the oyster sauce is too gummy from too much flour. The rice also tasted as if it was placed in a fridge and microwaved when ordered by a customer. On the second day, i ordered the seafood ho fan. Again, my gravest concern is their sauce that is filled too much in flour. The ho fan itself was overcooked and some noodles burnt black. I dont understand why the restaurant is packed when thejr food seems average and on some occasions overrated. If they cant cook simple dishes, then i sure doubt they can cook the more complicated ones
3
Location is not the best. There is some construction going on outside , therefore not much of a view to boast. Menu is simple, straightforward with most local food varieties. Chicken rice quality has suffered, with sub par standards. Nasi lemak was satisfying though. Overpriced in my opinion for such a casual setting.
1
OK, a friend of mine said that their chicken rice was supposedly THE one that made Singaporean chicken rice renowned the world over. So, I thought I'd give it a go... I gotta say... it was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I'm not really sure where to start...I ordered a chicken rice, a side dish of seasonal vegetable with oyster sauce, and chinese tea. Let's break it down, shall we?- The Chicken Rice - the chicken was dry, the broth was borderline to being tasteless, and the rice was only slightly better than steamed rice. The price? $25!!!!! REALLY???? For this garbage?? Melbourne's budget restaurant called Petaling Street could make a better chicken rice for all of $11!!!!- The seasonal vegetable with oyster sauce - the vegetable was sort of OK. At least it was fresh and crunchy. The oyster sauce? TERRIBLE. Absolutely tasteless! The price? $9!! WHAT???? It was only 1 stalk of bok choy, which usually does not even cost 50cents in Australia!- The chinese tea - It was OK. It was tea. Price? $9!!!! WHAT???? A pot of English Breakfast tea at most Melbourne 5-star HOTELS does not even cost that much!With total damage of just over $50, it was definitely one of the MOST DISAPPOINTING dining experience for me!!And oh, by the way, the service was APPALLING
4
The hainese chicken rice and sides were great, however the chicken was okay. The place was abit pricey but a safe bet.
3
It used to serve very good quality food, but not on my last visit - the chicken is dry, rice did not cook well and the over charge.
2
Location is excellent, right off Orchard and near the Somerset MRT, however this is all that the restaurant has going for it.We ordered the Nasi Goreng and the Fish Curry, both of dishes tasted average but were overpriced at ~S$25 each so terrible value. We asked for the fish curry to be made with no spice but they came back to us and told us the curry was pre-made and they could not change the level of spice. The lack of flexibility seems odd given the high price.Service was also poor, often times there wasn't a single person in sight, and we had a hard time waving anyone down as well as they seem too distracted talking to one another. There were two of us and our dishes came 5 minutes apart... the first dish they served was no longer hot by the time they served the second dish. They also forgot the egg on the Nasi Goreng but the server quickly noticed and ran back to the kitchen.Overall, there is nothing positive about this restaurant that would attract me back, there are much better options in the area
4
It has been a few years since I have lasted visited Chatterbox. Heard the original chef has left to set up his own restaurant. Decided to give it a try during the recent trip to Singapore. We tried the recommended lobster laksa and of course the famed Hainanese Chicken Rice set. Lobster laksa came in a gigantic bowl, so huge that I could barely finihs half! The whole baby Boston lobster was commendably fresh with bouncy flesh. Laksa broth was delectably rich with herbs and coconut milk. It's more than satisfied my laksa craving. The famed Hainanese Chicken Rice set, on the other hand, was nothing special. The chicken was smooth and tender, but nothing we can't get from Tian Tian or Boon Tong Kee. Maybe it has lost its lustre since the chef's departure?Service was great, nothing short of what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. We didn't have to wait at all to get a table (we were there after 830pm on a weekday). Staff were polite and efficient. However, at this kind of prices, unless one is on expense account, I am not sure it's the best place in Singapore for the chicken rice. Go for the lobster laksa, not chicken rice..
4
I had the chance to try this restaurant during a lunch business meeting with my father and his Singaporean colleagues. We were also booked in Mandarin Orchard, and the restaurant is within the hotel's premises. It was my first time to try Singaporean food, and I totally loved it. I had their ever-famous Hainanese chicken rice with bandung (rose-flavored milk tea) and sweet fruit rojak for dessert. We have been told that this restaurant is famous for their chicken rice. The texture of the chicken is very far from your usual well done/fried chicken. Some might even think it's raw/half-cooked meat with slimy chicken skins, like I did, but when you try the chicken with the 3 different sauces, you'll surely start to appreciate the taste. I have noticed that the dishes were also quite expensive (about 27+ sgd for the chicken rice), but for the huge amount of serving, it's worth it. Their bandung is still the best milk tea I've had in my life - very refreshing and fragrant. The rojak is also a must try - a sweet and spicy fried fruit dish. I fell in love with their chicken rice, rojak, and bandung, and I've been scouting restaurants from where I'm based just to look for those dishes I've had from Chatterbox
3
Its been sometime since I last visited this place, and still prefer the time when it was located on level one right at a corner.Honestly, the ambience in the restaurant had somewhat diminished over time. More like an upmarket food court these days. Food was pretty average but ingredients fresh though, and of cos it's fresh with the price we are paying for hawker styled food
2
A set of chicken rice cost $25, which is about 8 - 10 times more expensive than hawker centre. However, in terms of taste and quality, there is not much difference that I can tell as compared to Wee Nam Kee or other famous chicken rice stall at hawker centre. Besides, the chicken rice, we also ordered herbal bak ku teh and that too was a disappointment as the soup was so diluted in taste. Drinks are so expensive as they are priced at $9 even for a cup of humble soya bean drink. Definitely not worth the price paid. A celebration dinner with my family ended up with disappointment, but at least, my kids are convinced that good food are not necessary served in restaurants. I think they will be more agreeable to eat at hawker centre from now on.
2
Got a deal voucher decided to finally try out the famous chicken rice...Chicken Rice: Priced at SGD27.90 but doesn't taste as good as it costs! The chicken was not smooth and tender as Hainanese style chicken supposed to be and it smells a little. We prefer the rice and chilli than the chicken. Just few days back I had similar chicken rice at 10 times less the price and it was much better!Seafood Laksa: Priced at SGD32, we were there 1pm for lunch ordeed Lobster Laksa but Lobster sold out (at this time which is considered normal lunch time not late lunch) so had to take the seafood Laksa instead which was not bad, but again you can get similar at 10 times less the price and equivalent good.Drinks (Barley & Soya Milk): Priced at SGD9 each but nothing special.Will not return considering the high price and food quality. Service was ok
4
We ordered chicken rices and glass of Tiger beer and it costed us approximately 90SGD for two people.The decoration of restaurant is simple and modern but not fancy.Services are generally good.Famous chicken rice tastes good, well-cooked and neatly dished up.I don't have any complaint with this restaurant except for price.You can eat chicken rice at other restaurants nearby with half price, and I'm not sure it's worth to pay twice as much as others
5
I still remember the day when I first had my chicken rice at the Chatterbox at the age of around 10 with my parents. 40 years on and I must have frequented the place a few hundred times, even though the place has been renovated and moved several times within the hotel premises, but the taste of its chicken rice remains the same and as delicious as ever. I have recently returned to UK in 2008 and made a vist to the place in 2011. Chatterbox is no longer at it previous prminent ground floor location but on 5th floor of the hotel. The foods are very pricey when comparing to others locally. The place was also less crowded than years before due to its location? and prices? I ordered all the signature dishes like chicken rice, satays, rojak, kway teow...all still tasting the same...after 40 years...I must commend the place for keeping up the standard and quality after so many years. Many argues there are better food at cheaper prices elsewhere, but Chatterbox is a Singapore institution, and its food an acquired tastes for bringing back fond and warm memories of family and friends
4
The lobster laksa was excellent. The food is solid. The hotel is horrible.
3
easy dinning, Chicken and rice was good. Very easy to get in and out.
3
It's selling more of the brand than the taste. Just chicken rice to me. Expensive for the plate. Had better ones which are cheaper.

This famous restaurant is situated in the madarin orchard hotel in orchard road. It's a bistro style restaurant which is apparently famous for its chicken rice.The decor is trendy and contemporary but the restaurant is expensive compared to other restaurants nearby.We ordered chicken rice, lobster laksa, a crab side dish and a couple of lychee mixers. In terms of service, the waiter couldn't care less and wasn't very helpful and our food order took forever to arrive (it took more than half an hour) and was only partially fulfilled (we were only told about an hour later after our initial order that they had forgotten to cook our crab side dish after we had complained). We also found what looked like a strand of human hair in our unfinished chicken rice dish, which they took away to examine and claimed it was a root from lemongrass. Needless to say we are not planning to go back and have told our friends and family of our experience
3
went here because i heard a great deal regarding their chicken rice.it was basically plain and somewhat okay and expensive.we ordered this along with some noodles, rolls, and satay.i believe i can't comprehend the amount with the food taste. the service was excellent but the food to amount ratio not that quite...i guess i could get the same kind/quality and taste for these kind of food at a lesser expense
4
Visited this restaurant recently with the wife and kids for a special occasion. We had been there twice before but not since the Meritus Mandarin had undergone a massive renovation. Whereas it had been on the ground floor before, it's now located on the fifth floor of the hotel. Needless to say, it was completely unrecognisable to me now.Anyway, it was really the chicken rice that I was looking forward to. Being the signature dish, it's probably the best-selling one for the restaurant. Many reviewers have mentioned that the standard has dropped and it's over-priced. Probably somewhat true for the former and definitely true in the latter, in my opinion. But let's face it, what makes for good chicken rice is as divisive an issue to Singaporeans as good pizza is to residents of New York or Chicago. The portions of sliced chicken were about almost two and a half times what one gets in a food court or hawker centre stall, so that makes up (a little) for the high prices, I guess. My wife had the lobster laksa which was delicious and yes, even more pricey...but what does one expect?What I did like, though, was that the restaurant had not lost the friendly relationship with guests. It was very much a family restaurant still, with many guests being there for a nice weekend meal. And the dress code was simple - many were dressed in bermudas and T-shirts, something that would be fairly unthinkable for a restaurant located in a 5-star hotel in many parts of the world
4
I tried several chicken rice in SG and I found Chatterbox is the best one in SG. Anyway the best chicken rice is not in SG, so do not expect much. last time i went there, it was too busy. prepare some waiting time and enjoy the meal.

We used to go to the Chatterbox in the past. Being a 24 hours high quality outlet within the Mandarin hotel, we always experienced pricey but excellent Singaporean food. Several times I tried to convince the chef to tell me how he is making the excellent satay sauce.That was the past.We arrived at a few minutes before 1am. The place looked death ! half the lights out. The staff explained us that they now close at 1:30am because of "little business only during the night". I ordered the fish and chips (36SGD+++) and sate (18SGD+++) for my wife. Suspicious about the changes and the lack of customers I asked the waiter if the tartare sauce is made "in house" as you would expect for a 36SGD F&Chips. He brought me a sample of the tartare. The "stuff" I was presentated was simply uneatable, stuffed with suggar and other artificial components. The waiter apologized and told me that it was something they bought from outside. I promptly cancelled my Fish&Chips and tried to rince my mouth with a few glasses of water. The chicken satay itself was good, the satay sauce, again, bad. No more in house satay sauce. Another cheap industrial low quality ingredient replaced what used to be the reason we go to the Chatterbox. All be all a rip off. Sky rocketting prices combined with low quality food. Any Kopitiam - Tee Tarik or other descent food court in Singapore delivers much better at a fraction (20%) of the price. Poor Chatterbox - what have you done to us. We had no other choice than to go to the nearest Mc Donalds - right in the back of the hotel
4
The chicken rice is not any different than other hawker store except the fact that it's served in the 5 star hotel's restaurant. It has contantly receiving the raving reviews from the foreigners, as the name 'chicken rice' is quite intriguing. It's also one of the food that make Singapore unique. Not many 5 star hotel such chicken rice except Chatterbox at Mandarin Orchard
5
We eat at the chatter box everytime we go to Singapore. They make the best chicken rice in town. The local Singaporeans claim that it is the priciest chicken rice in town, but they compare it to the prices at food courts and hawkers centres. This is a restaurant in a five star hotel in Orchard road! The hotel management claim that it was the first hotel that started serving this dish and offered it to international customers
2
get with the plan ... the original chef has long left!
3
guessed the old chefs have retired, it doesn't match it
3
Okay but not great. The old restaurant was better. More cozy, better food, not as pricey.
4
The waitresses served my colleagues and I and laughed and made us feel welcome. Very unlike the experience inside the Mandarin Orchard.
The food was stunning and cheap.
Very desirable!
3
jaded, need i say more? im not interested. old menu. nothing improves while they hang onto to their laurels..of yore
2
What used to be a highlight has lost it's charm as one of the best chicken rice in singapore. albeit the fragrant rice, for the price you pay and how to get to choose the part of chicken served, not worth the hype.
3
Had a weekend stay at the Hotel and ate dinner there that night. The place is bustling with half the tables ordering the outlet's traditional mainstay - the Hainanese Chicken Rice set. We did too and it was pretty good although for $26 per serve, it is over-priced. But obviously this does not stop people from coming and eating it so what can I say? The other dishes we ordered were average and also overpriced.
3
I live in Singapore. Chicken rice is good nearly everywhere. You're paying about 8-10 times what the average person who lives in Singapore would normally pay for a similar dish. i suppose you're paying for the hotel's iconic status as a chicken rice expert. But I'd just head to any of the other food courts in the same area because it really doesn't taste better than everywhere else

being a local, after 3 decade the chicken rice in this coffee shop has not change in taste at all, though price are bit on high side compared to those that can be found in food court, it is worthwhile to taste what is the actual flavor of this dish is all about, besides most of the local cuisines are very authentic too. highly recommend to try it out during your visit to the country

We were staying at the Mandarin Orchard and were still getting over jet lag. So, on the first night, we decided to pick a restaurant in the hotel. Loved the modernish-vibe of Chatterbox, from the green chairs to the placemats. The restaurant was very open and bright, two plusses for me. I had the seafood hor fun, and my friends ate the chicken rice. My seafood hor fun was good, but the aromatic smell of the chicken rice made me kind of wish I had done the chicken rice. Several days later, we ate at a food court in a shopping mall where the locals eat, far removed from Orchard Road, and I finally got my chicken rice. It was much cheaper ($4 Sing) compared to the price of Chatterbox, but all things considered, the nice atmosphere of Chatterbox and that heavenly smell of the rice, and generous portions would make me want to revisit Chatterbox

At one time famous for the Singapore signature dish "Chicken Rice" - now very high price, couldn't care less food and Chinese tea [believe it they give you a Tea Bag!! A Tea bag and charge 100 x the price! OMG

I like the aromatic chicken rice, chicken is tender, but is expensive.

Chatterbox is the place - go for local food and you cannot go wrong with your selection

Famous for its chicken rice but costly around S$15 per plate!

Used to frequent this regularly but now only visit rarely. Very high price for good chicken rice and local fare in a very nice setting.

Expensive and lousy chicken rice.
Tourist trap for tourists.
Many better places for chicken rice.

My favorite dishes are hainanese chicken rice and some dish with soft shell crab. and also the salad

The chicken rice has a great presentation but taste seemed to be a bit commercial. Boon Tong Kee has better chicken rice.

I visited this restaurant based on the local taxi driver recommendation. It was a very disappointing visit. I ordered the award-winning Mandarin Chicken Rice, vegetables with oyster sauce and Fruit Rojak. This should be the most pricey chicken rice in town, which cost SGD 27 for one pax portion. The steamed white chicken meat is fairly tender. The vegetable cooked lost its original fresh taste though. The Fruit Rojak taste is moderately good. It is not as appetizing as we expected overall.One time try! I would not recommend another visit

Okay, so it's very expensive, $31.8 for a chicken rice - you can get 10 of them in Tian Tian. But it's also an experience. If I live in Singapore, most likely I won't go to Chatterbox every week. But for a tourist, it's a must

Chicken rice is 27SGD and a barley drink will cost you 9SGD. Food is great and restaurant is clean but in my opinion, the green fluorescent lights make the place very cheesy. It ruins pictures too.

Good but not fantastic when you look at the price

Chicken rice with posh price. Ideal to take your overseas friends who are not farmiliar with eating at hawker stool....

Well known hotel cafe - open 24 hours. Food is decent, but not cheap. However, it's the best air conditioned option at 4am. Chicken rice is famous, but overrated.

Memories of childhood for the $20 chicken rice...oh my.the old chef has gone to the heartlands to set up his own biz. not too bad over there.

Excellent chicken rice but pricey

If you stay in Singapore you have to try the best local dish of S'pore traditional cuisine: Chicken Rice!Despite it is quite expensive (29SG$) and you can found same food for less than half price, flavour and satisfaction is still AWESOME!!!!!The rest of the meals are quite good but cannot be compared with it is star dish!!!!

Stopped by Chatterbox for a quick snack. Right from the start, the service was extremely poor and at a level way below Singapore's normal high standards.The service was very slow, drinks took an age to arrive and table was not laid properly (no napkins). The staff were happy enough to stand around chatting and totally failed to keep the diners happy.When the food did arrive, it was very average and overall, this place is poor value for money.I would not be happy to recommend this restaurant at all.Would not recommend thi

Happened to be here a number of times this 2010, but i realised that the service standard is really lousy compared to ten years ago.They service is very slow and i can hear the captain just telling the waiters "let them wait" when we asked them why our food is so slow. This is really lousy and i believe we are paying a premium on the food which will usually cost less at other outlets. Our water goblet is never refilled and we need to ask for it. The food wise is still good enough. But i believe they should work to improve their attitude and service standard

This restaurant is know for their Mandarin Chicken Rice, and is always written up and being the best in Singapore. But how can anyone eat chicken & rice when there is Lobster Laska on the menu. At $28 it is pricey but cooked perfectly and presented well. During our visit to Singapore we were told that they only make so many laska's a day so don't wait until dinner to get there in case they run out

So Far they have greatest Hainanese Chicken Rice..Brur...But, after changing their Chef??? How is it...I send this quest to Public!

The chicken rice is still one of the best if you willing to pay for it. I remember the sago melaka is quite nice too.

A good 5* venue for local food like Chicken Rice and Laksa. The Chicken Rice takeaway is well packed for the plane or as gifts to friends in nearby countries (eg. HK).

the famous High-end Hainan Chix rice.....

Its over-hyped Chicken Rice with nice presentation of the food for tourist or business acquaintance. There's plenty of nice Chicken Rice found in many places of Singapore.
