The omakase dishes I love most was the advocado cheese which was really good and nice as well as the beef cabbage and the rest of the omakase beef set course that I enjoyed eating.

Pretty good teppanyaki on level 5 wisma atria. business here is quite good compared with the rest of the japan food hall which was rather quiet

Food was really great! Very memorable omakase experience. Will definitely return to try the rest on the menu!!

Had omakase and the only dish that's worth remembering is the beef. Everything else is so so only. Not worth second try.
Service is slow and bad. Probably short handed.

We had the omakase wagyu beef set, the most expensive item on the menu. We expected more beef but was only served a small portion. Next time will try just the beef set instead of the omakase.

We enjoy our dinning . The seafood is fresh and the meat is tender. Is a good dinning place for family and for business too as the atmosphere is quite. Will visit again in the near future

The food was amazing and nicely cooked. The omakase set menu was filling and the portion was generous. The staff was also friendly too!

we went for the omakase for my partner's birthday. food was delicious and the service was great too.

If it's your first time to an Osaka restaurant, go for their reasonable set dinners. Don't miss the wagyu tenderloin and pork belly omelet. I found the sesame tofu a bit strange in texture - not my favourite. Sit at the counter if you can get a seat - and have fun with the two chefs, one from Osaka and one from Tokyo.

Lively eatery that serves Japanese omakaze style dinner. Must try is of course their ohmi wagyu sirloin done medium. Thumbs up to the chef that did it perfectly. It is served with grilled garlic slices. Rare find these days. Their tamago is soft and flavorful. If you want carbs, try their yakisoba. We prefer the normal type without bbq sauce. Very nice place for omakaze dinner.

The set A Omakase was sumptuous especially the beef that melts in your mouth. Service staff was great!

I thought it would be more delicately done
Was OK if you are not looking for sth quiet and romantic.

Food is fresh and well prepared by chef and it is so interesting to be seated at the bar counter to watch the chefs at work. Excellent service by the staffs too.

Had another great visit to Osaka Kitchen. Can't fault the food or service. Really fantastic place! Highly recommend a counter seat and of course the must try okonomiyaki! :)

A small establishment but valued for money teppanyaki place to go for. Food & service are very good even on a busy weekend night.

Food was good, portion albeit small. Service was very friendly.
The chicken was a great dish and so was the beef. The teppanyaki chicken tasted like roast pork!
Beef tendon and cabbage was very tasty and will order it again!

On the whole, the food was average though the ingredients are fresh. Only the egg item got the wow factor. The dessert was a real disappointment.

If you like teppanyaki you'll know that they are either very formal affairs or friendly informative foods havens. This one is the latter. It's situated on the 4th floor of Wilma Altria Mall and is tucked away in a corner. You know it's good when they are turning away custom because they're packed out and that custom is actually queuing up outside, rather than opting for one of the myriad of surrounding restaurants.All food is cooked in front of you and presented with helpful advice of what dips and condiments will enhance it best.Loved it. If you're in Singapore, love teppanyaki and enjoy a fLively friendly atmosphere, don't miss it

From the moment you step in, everyone kept rushing you to order drinks. After we are done with the main course, we were "politely" invited out . Another group of people came in without reservation and they were told that they can only use the table for one hour. But I reserved the table! Yet I also got the one hour treatment. Then what's the point in reservation?
