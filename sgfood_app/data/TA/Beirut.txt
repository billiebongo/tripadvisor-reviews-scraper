Good food at a reasonable price, well worth a visit. We had lamb mousaka and a signature chicken kebab with special marinade, great combination of flavours, would definitely come back or recommend.
5
I think this might have been the best sandwich I have ever had. (Or pita/roll). It was lamb, and it was delicious. Like, I was eating alone and my internet wasn't working so I stopped watching Netflix to simple enjoy the taste. Completely rejuvenating, will go back for it again
5
This is my 2nd visit with my girlfriend at Beirut Grill.. My first visit here was our company dinner.. The place is cool and food really fascinated me.Today we had Mixed Grilled kebeb and ordered extra 2pcs of their famous lamb chops.. its trully yummy food.. The staff so friendly and even offered us a dessert called mohalabya, which is too good to be true! smily chefs, friendly staff and BEST LAMB CHOPS..thumbs up!
5
It was a family dinner. Awesome place, busy street as it's closed for traffic entire road is a food place. You get all nice non vegetarian and also vegetarian food. Bit pricey it costs about 40 SGD per person, no complaints though. For somebody who enjoys a busy place with nice food don't miss this place. All kinds of soft and hard drinks are served. Cocktails and Moctails are plenty. Non veg lovers can't afford to miss
5
After being hassled by some of the other restaurants in this area, we found this gem of a restaurant just across the road from the hotel we were staying in for a few days. The staff were very friendly, didn't pressurise us at all, and managed to squeeze us in on a busy Saturday night. They served us lovely Lebanese food. We liked it so much we went back the following night to sample more of their menu. Will look this place up again next time we go to Singapore

I went there with my daughter because it is listed as one of the Halal resto within walking distance of where we were staying. We were starving and a bit tired and went to this resto just after lunch hour. There were about 3-4 tables with patrons. I am not familiar with Lebanon cuisine, so can only guessed by the description. We ended up ordering the hummus platter and chicken swarma, and ice mint-tea. All of them were good. It felt a bit pricey at first, but then we saw that most of the other resto offering Turkish or middle-eastern food are listing about the same price range. So, it was okay, then.
5
Been here before. And we love the Lamb Chops. Super super good. My wife had the mussaka and she enjoyed it. We had their mezze platter for starter and kunafe for desert. Tried Lebanese wine - Chateu Musar for the first time and we were pleasantly surprised. Our server explained it is one of the best wine from the region. Definitely going back again.

Having visited this establishment for the past 7 years, I have found the food to be perhaps the best Middle Eastern food in Singapore (and I visit the Middle East on business often). Consistently good, reasonably priced with very warm service. It’s a small place so they get full quickly so I suggest booking a few hours in advance.
1
Strange that as a visitor to Singapore and coming to this restaurant for the first time... I was expecting all the wonderful reviews on Tripadvisor to be legitimate. Upon tasting the "Lebanese" offerings at this place it is clear that their system of remuneration of customers to review this place well is the only reason the rating is so high... Because it certainly wasn't for the quality of the food. Horrific excuse for Lebanese food.... The one black spot in my 10 day trip to this wonderful country!Don't believe everything you read... Beware
5
I and my friends love to go out for good foods.thats why we tried this place based on what we have read on reviews. Indeed we wer not sorry to discover Babaghanoz , muhamara, ! :-)the textures of the dips totally made us crave for more .The mix grilled meats are up to our expectations..the kofta was too good to be true, the flavours are too delicious!!The belly Dancer performance is an added experience for us. She’s so pretty and dance well.. we will be back again and will recommend Beirut to all our friends
5
Yes, I came here twice in the span of two weeks because it was that good. I loved everything about this place: the atmosphere, the amazing house music being played and more importantly, the food. It's really that good.
Always get the mezza platter.
4
Beirut is a nice restaurant at Arab market, serving good Lebanese food (esp., chicken schwarma platter). Not too many seats, so best to reserve.
4
Went to have a late lunch. Took meze platter, Beirut Pastry Platter, Halloumi and spicy sausages. All was really tasty. Service was nice and everything well organized. Could visit again.
5
My favourite place within the heart of Kg Glam. The Jalapeno hummus and their signature dish " Shish Taouk" cannot be skipped on every single visit. An entertaining place to be on weekend. Good ambience and prompt service as always! Well done Beirut team!!
5
Decided to try it on our recent holiday and ended up going there twice in a week. Yes, the Shish Taouk is amazing (my wife only ordered that during both our visits) but there are a lot more gems in that menu. Cant remember the exact names but I tried:* the lamb kebab (comes with rice) this was heavenly succulent* Hummus with pita bread - just right. their pita breads were freshly made and melted in my mouth* tandoori Chicken (yes, tandoori Chicken) - the tastiest, juiciest and tender I’ve had in a whileI was also pleasantly surprised that they had a great selection of cocktails and most importantly, they got their sangria spot on! Reached a little earlier during my second visit so went for the happy hour beer on the tap :)Its a great place to eat, drink and chill after you’re done exploring the neighbouring haji lane and arab street. The staff is friendly, service quick, crowd is classy, and yes, the belly dancing adds a nice little touch to the experience.Definitely recommend as a welcome change from the sensory overload that Singapore offers
5
Visited Singapore last week and I’m not very open to experimenting with food but Beirut blew me away. I literally dined there thrice in a span of six days. The pita is so die for. The Shish Taouk was delicious. On Friday a beautiful belly dancer kept us in the groove. Very friendly staff with quick service. Highly recommended
5
Never sorry to eat in this restaurant. We had the mezze plater as starter with the house salad, And for main dish we had the meat platter. Meats are cooked well accordingly, juicy. Salad is done freshly;I never had these good taste of food anywhere in Arab street.For a dessert we had the Oum Ali, a must try when you visit this place.. Thank you for such a lovely dinner Beirut Grill..

After reading online about this place being one of the best and "most authentic" Lebanese restaurants in Singapore... We had to give it a go...(I was visiting from Australia... A Lebanese person such as myself growing up with this cuisine gave me a fairly strong grounding in what "authentic" actually means...When we arrived....of the many Lebanese options in the Arab district; this was the least welcoming and most drab. It was like they weren't interested in having customers. But the reviews were good...so hey ..whatever right?The first thing we did notice when we arrived was prominent leaflets on all of the tables - offering rewards for posting favourable reviews on Google and Trip Advisor. WE WERE DUPED! This wasn't the best joint at all...these guys were buying good feedback and luring unsuspecting patrons to what turns out to be overpriced poor quality food!The food that followed was close to the worst Lebanese food we have ever experienced (calling it Lebanese food is a stretch)... Topped off by the Labneh which was more like laughing cow cheese dressed as the famous dish! Someone needs to tell these guys that Lebanese food is not known for the amount of heat and spice you can add to each dish...it's about fresh flavoursome ingredients and produce. If I wanted Indian food... I would have gone to a different district... The Fatouche salad should be vibrant and crispy ...what we received looked like it had a sepia filter applied to it! I could name every dish and go through how flawed they were... But you get the jist.Really poor restaurant - we really regret going there, particularly after bypassing so many honest looking options on the way...Unfortunately we can't go lower than a 1 in terms of a score.. But do yourself a favour and stay away
5
Was there at around at 7 pm.Had the delicious lamb chops with rice ,fresh hummus ,pita bread and a beer.Excellent food and service from miss Rohda !Much thanks to her and her friendly team at Beirut Grill for making it a wonderful First visit for me ! I will certainly come back again
5
I`ve tried middle eastern food in few restaurants around Arab street and didn`t like the cuisine, until I accidentally visited Beirut Grill. I was impressed with food quality and friendly service. Their Meze Platter is to die for! And pita bread sooooo good! They have bellydancing performance on Fri and Sat to keep you entertained. Will definitely come back there soon for dinner and drinks
5
You will always get value for money in this place. The food is really tasty and authentic labaniese food.
Full of flavour at every bite.
5
Food was great,both meat and vegetarian food.Excellent service,Friendly staff, nice ambiance .I can say it was great experience
5
Great service and great ambiance. The best part of this visit to this place was the excellent food surely can say spot on. Must visit place when you are in singapore. Great place. Thumbs u
5
Having lived in the Middle East made me got familiarized with the real taste of arab food. Coming to this place, BEIRUT GRILL justified the true, authentic taste of middle eatern food.. Muhammara and Babaghanoug with their own freshly made pita bread, perfect marination of the Shish Taouk together with their fattoush salad, delicious.!!!Staff are so friendly, they would make you feel at home; one of the chef came out to served my appetizer with a smile which is very rare experience around Singapore.AND, they have a bar too at 2nd level where you can enjoy International cocktails too.. cozy place, perfect ambiance, perfect food!! Highly recommended for those whose looking for true lebanese food and good service!!Mabrouk Beirut Grill!
5
My wife and i love to eat different kind of cuisine. Decided to check trip advisor to look for lebanese food. We agreed to go beirut grill. From the moment we got there,we feel already the heart warming welcome of the staff. Genuine smile and they make us feel special eventhough the restaurant is full. Maybe thats the way they really treat their guest. We feel very comfortable. Then food comes. The platter dips was so tasty and match up with a cotton soft bread. Lamb chops was fantastic. The taste texture and smell was perfect. Even the kofta roll. Nothing left in our plate. Juicilicious!!!! Great ambiance with great staff and great food deserves PERFECT rating and review. Thank u for this experience. Keep it up!!!
4
Had a good business lunch and the partners enjoyed the food. Have eaten here before for dinner, and the lunch is just as good. Had guests over from Malaysia, so they had Halal and vegetarian food options as well. At lunchtime, the noise level is low enough that you can conduct a decent business conversation. The skewers and mezze platter are very good, and especially the lamb. Dessert platter with baklava could be better
5
Loved the ambiance of the place and especially the mouth watering kebabs!! purely authentic lebanese cuisine. The place you surely must visit when you're in Singapore! Thumbs Up!!
5
i was very happy an surprised to c and find an Arabic restaurant with a very testy meal ... specially when i smelled and test the mix grill with decoration on the plate and also i found an Arabic belly dance program ... i felt that am in gulf or Arabic country ... i enjoyed toooooooooooooooooooooo much .. and my advice to any one who is planning to visit Singapore .. first he got to eat from the Beirut grill restauran
5
Had a great meal at this place last night, was starving for authentic lambs chops and this place nailed it.... it was grilled to perfection with the right amount of charredness... yumzzzz... and the labnah... creamy and cool.... for sure we will be back again...
5
Everytime we came to have lunch or dinner always we have a good satisfaction from the food,drinks,and to all friendly staffs.. it’s a good experience to us ❤
5
Humus is absolutely excellent. Falafel rolls are very fresh and tasty. We recommend this authentic Lebanese restaurant !
5
The food was really good, it came fast even though the place was quite busy. The staff is very friendly and establishment is really cozy, my girlfriend and I had a great time!
5
Had the hommus and lamb kofta roll both were excellent excellent and very good value for money. Highly recommen
5
My local friends brought me here when I visited Sg recently. And what an amazing experience. We booked at their dining lounge at level 2. It's so pretty , like a scene out of a romantic Arabian movie. We took one of the cabanas at the back. The food was delicious. Especially the Mixed Grill platter and eggplant dish. The dips were super good - we tried a few. Hummus was best ever. Lamb chops are to die for. They had belly dancers and even got us to dance along. The street below is also very vibrant and had a live band. Prices are quite reasonable for the quality they provide. And staff is very courteous and fast. Certainly going back there when I return !!My favourite dining experience in Singapore so far.
5
We deceived to have dinner at Beirut for our last night in Singapore. I’ve noticed it before and after a recommendation from a acquaintance we were convinced. We were greeted friendly and places outside as awe asked for (even though rain was expected and came eventually, we moved in then). It was a beautiful atmosphere and we were served quickly. I asked if I could have just a single kofta instead of a full meal and they accommodated my request promptly for half the price of the main. I was very surprised when the fish came out including roasted vegetables, rice and sauces (very generous portion).We started with paprika hommus and a shared a seafood platter which was delicious. Staff was attentive, food portions generous, fresh and delicious.Pricing reasonable. We really enjoyed our stay and I would definitely recommend Beirut and return
5
I ate at Beirut Grill yesterday evening and i was impressed on several levels. As a chef and a restauranteur, i know my food and i have criteria to rate my restaurant that i use at every restaurant i visit.Staff - very attentive, quick and polite. Very happy with the service. Speed of food - the food came appropriately quickly, freshly cooked and hot.Quality of food - absolutely fantastic food, as someone of middle eastern descent i will say it’s 100% authentic. The food was incredible! I has some grilled chicken and some lamb kofta with rice. Atmosphere- it’s located in a busy ‘happening’ area and it has that cosy feel. I liked it. My perception of time - unrushed, good atmosphere, the right amount of noise and good timing of the food. From seating to paying, it was very pleasant, I didn’t wait long for anything, I wasn’t rushed between courses and we sat and has a chat after we ate. Payment - quick and easy! I will go again for sure. It’s an astonishingly good food.

Where taken here by an ex pat Aussie, food was fresh and flavoursome, we had some mixed entrees followed by the lamb chops, very reasonably priced, we had one bottle of wine and more than enough food for the three of us at a cost of $118. Service was not as good as I thought it should of been given the number of restaurants close by. Worth a try if you want some Lebanese. The whole street is a hive of activity, so worth a look
2
We selected this place based on the Foodpanda reviews. We had the pitta bread, hummus, shish taouk and lamb kebab kofta (via Foodpanda). With the exception of the hummus (which was lovely), the rest of our meal was substandard (and we are a family that appreciates good middle eastern food). Perhaps it was a trainee chef on the day, because we have heard lots of great things about this place, so maybe it may be better next time. Second, our order came to 75 SGD. This was a real let down because we ordered one of each dish expecting greater quantities for those prices, but we were still hungry after the meal. This is overpriced because we had a hotdog, burger and club sandwich with fries/soft drinks at the Hard Rock Cafe in Sentosa for 83 SGD and we left filled to the brim with food remaining. Please do try to rectify this
4
The place is famous. You'd know it from the amount of reviews, the good ones!So I just dropped by to tell you that you won't regret ordering this dish. You can share it among 2 or 3 people. Oum Ali.. sounds spiritual! Actually it is! Healed my soul! (Ok, I exaggerate when it comes to dessert. But you will like it)You can thank me later :)

Beirut Grill...was there past weekend with couple of friends. Found the place was quite busy and packed,few tables were empty but with glasses n plates...same time a guy ( wearing formal ) approach us and asked ; if we need table... We asked for sitting outside and instantly he clear the table and provide us seats which was good enough.. as we didn't know much about labanese food so decided to go on recommendations.. We had parsley salad,cold dips with bread,falfel,sausage chicken with rice, minced lamb and hot cream pudding in desserts. A must say so delicious food...! It was really a great evening with foods and drinks, warm welcome and awesome service. Belly dance was the unique experience during dinning... We will visit this place again as it's so beautiful atmosphere around. Lots of people hanging around throughout the dinning period...Thanks to TripAdvisor for dinning suggestions, Beirut Grill and the guy who made us comfortable there....-- Yana --

On a 48 hour visit to Singapore, I stumbled into this terrific Lebanese restaurant near Arab street. TheBeirut Mazza platter is a great deal and includes a tasting of authentic hummus, baba ghannouj, eggplant salad, falafel and cheese rolls. They were all exceptionally good. The tabouleh was below average and included local spices that are not typical. The freshly baked bread enhanced the experience. While we didn't have the Kabob, it looked really good and well presented. Great spot for lunch and dinner. Average cost by Singaporean standards.
5
After completing both Red and Yellow tours of the Hop On Hop Off bus we decided what we wanted to see. I have visited Singapore around 12 times in the past 9 years and seen a lot but this is the first time I was there for a length of time with my wife and it was a pleasure showing her some of the places I had seen and completing my Singapore "bucket list". Arab Street was a bit of a let down all Dress Shops and Carpet Shops though some of the traditional woven cushion covers were magnificent but you have to restrict your souvenir buying at some stage. After visiting Istana Kampong Glam which is now a Museum to the original Malay settlers and a visit to the Masjid Sultan Mosque we wandered down Bussorah Street two blocks to seek out the Beirut Grill which was just great. We enjoyed the Hummus and Baba Ghanoush in the Mezza and the exquisite grilled lamb and the famous Lamb Chop we forgot to take any foodie pics.
5
We are from Melbourne, Australia which has an outstanding range of Lebanese and Turkish restaurants and communities.In general, we have found Singapore a little expensive and wine very expensive.Given the outstanding quality of the dishes, we found Beirut Grill very good value. The mezze plate. was outstanding with smoky eggplant, excelllent hummus and a chunky, fresh eggplant dip. we had a very good Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon for under $40 ( Happy hour, before 7:30 pm). So the combination of very good food and wine is a stand out for Singapore. And this is very centrally located
5
Loved the Lebanese food, the lamb chops were amazing, fish was amazing cooked in Lebonese style( must try) . Very friendly staff . I haven't seen so many varieties of Humous any where else . Lovely expletive. Highly recommend. We went with family. But if you go as couple they have a club upstairs - amazing music last time I was there with my hubby. We partied a few times at their club magic carpet. A definite to visit with friends and family . They have outdoor sitting too.
1
Ordered take away and just could not eat the food, I ordered simple food: humus fatuesh, and chicken Shaurma and I am from that region. Absolutely terrible could not even tell what was in the food do not even try
5
Being a lover of everything Mediterranean, I was disappointed with the lack of good dining options in Singapore. That was until I had the chance to dine at this great spot as a part of a friends 30th birthday celebration. We had the lounge on second level exclusively booked for us and I must say what a great spot to celebrate special occasions. The lamb chops were to die for, the Shish Taouk was juicy and melt in the mouth and left us craving for more. If you think you had a good sangria, wait till you have the most amazing sangria at this lovely spot - apparently a recipe the owner himself came up with. What added to the ambiance besides the lovely Mediterranean decor was the music they had playing and the beautiful belly dancer who added the extra shine to the already amazing dining experience we were having. We finished the meal off with knafeh and baklava that were to die for. Great staff, lovely ambiance and food that will make you come back for more
5
I've been visiting this place quite a few time already and the food is always really good ! It's a really nice place, a must when coming to the Arab street area ! Very happy to see that Amber is back, he is a good host and makes the experience even better :
4
After living in the Middle East for a number of years, I missed it's food. Tried Beirut restaurant and have to say its nice. Sure, I will go again
3
I decided to treat my Wife to some Mediterranean fare on her birthday and booked this place for Saturday evening. We arrived late and they were gracious enough to host us. Realised it's because the upper floor was basically empty. The usher tried to push us into one of the large square seating sofas which was dirty, worn out at the edges and had a big water spill. When I pointed it out, he reluctantly offered me the sofa next to it. I didn't figure out why he wasn't keen to offer me the same sofa earlier as no one turned up for the entire 100 odd minutes we were there. Okay coming to service, the guys serving are very attentive except this once when I had to remind them that I had asked for a beer some time back. No one came to check if I wanted a second beer. Other than that no complaints. The food is great. The hummus and all the dips are freshly made and the pita bread is amazing. We ordered vegetarian and non-vegetarian fares and it all came up tops.Recommend for the food, not for the ambience, which is seedy at best and needs an upgrade.
5
True and authentic Lebanese cuisine in the heart of SingaporeMixed grill KebabHumusGreek sizzling cheeseAnd FalalelWhere else only here!!!!! Good and fast serive Courteous Price reasonable and worth it!!!
4
Is really a good place to check it out if you have no plans for the night. Went to check out the other day when me and my friends happen to pass by. Good ambiance and we have not been expose to this new vibe before. Check it out if you haven't. i bet you guys will understand what i meant after going. Cheers
5
Absolutely brilliant lunch we had. Pls try out chicken shawarma platter and shish gaouk. One will really love it. They know how to cook authentic lebanese Middle eastern food. No wonder there is no seat available on Fri n Sat nights and we hv to book a table much in advance. Do not miss out on this deligh
4
Tasty food, attentive and friendly staff, quiet street in the middle of Singapore. You can't go wrong with this place. Whether it's for a quick snack and drink, or a proper sit down for a good meal. The food is very tasty and proportioned well.The staff is quick, friendly and attentive, especially Roda the head waitress/restaurant manager.The price is reasonable for the quality and quantity.
4
Went for dinner with a group of friends on Sat night. Food was good and so was the atmosphere. There was a belly dancing performances by a beautiful young lady. We had a kebab, meat and seafood platters. The food was was good.The service was friendly and attentive. Price is mid-range. Worth trying
5
Excellent service and food! Hummus was delicious and so were our platter of Kebabs (chicken,lamb and beef) dips and the rice with it was smashing! It lives up to its great reviews on Trip Advisor.
4
We ate here last week and are likely to go back this week - we arrived at around 550pm so service was a little lacklustre - however the quality of the ingredients and the excellent preparation was obvious. A good menu with all the classics and the Shish Taouk was juicy and perfectly spiced
5
Best place for dinner. We have been here loads of times and every time we have great food, great atmosphere and a great time. The food is excellent and well priced. The dancing and music is a very nice addition to the evening
4
It was nice to sit outside and enjoy the relaxed vibe of this pedestrian street. Tasty food (moussaka portion sizeable and cold meze starter platter good for two) and able to hear the live music from next door interspersed with some belly dancing. All finished off with a little bit of baklava... we'll be back
5
When you are over faced with a choice of restaurants and you don't know where to go, it always seems to be a wise move to go where is busy....we did for Beirut, and it was absolutely worth it. Great food, wonderful service and even a brief belly dancing show between courses!The Shish Taouk (chicken) was excellent
5
Went here on a Friday night as two couples. Sat outside and enjoyed both the music from a small band further up the road and two belly dance performances by a beautiful young lady. We had a mezze platter for entrée which contained the best falafel I've ever had and the dips were very good too. For main we had one meat and one seafood platter, again the food was delicious and the three platters were enough to satisfy our appetites. The service was friendly and attentive. Highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for great Lebanese food and great atmosphere. Three platters, a cocktail, two wines and four beers, total was approx $200SGD.
4
I am a regular visitor to this place. I bring along friends and colleagues. Like the food, including the Dessert, with Oum Ali being my favourite. The service is also good, with the staff being very friendly. I usually trouble them with the seating arrangements, and they always comply. :-D Not enough fans for those sitting on the outside though (that's why I don't give them 5). Overall, still my top choice in Arab Street area
5
Great place for chill and mediterranean food. Always packed. Good service and amazing food. Difficult to get table outside
5
Just an amazing place to chillout around near Arab street area. Great food and drinks ; value for money. Loved the way they served and mouth watering food. Lebneh, falafel roll, baklava platter and beer tower is at great price. Menu got great selections for all kind of food lovers. Highly recommended ****
5
Came across to this resto called Beirut Grill,as a tourist i find the place coozy,staff very welcoming and accomodating..The set lunch was affordable and food was great,good to recommend for everyone
4
The restaurant had a great environment and delicious food. Whatever you order, please get the hummus as a starter! And if you are lucky, you might even get to enjoy a belly dance performance! Great place for a small gathering
5
Great place, at the arab street area, good location and also very yummy food. Remember came here one night there was even a belly dancing show. Very interesting. Favourite is the mixed grill platter
2
Dined with family, and was a really average experience and meal. The food was bland and average. Meze of mixed dips fell flat Big time: each dip tasted like the next, very little flavour. Only 4 measley pieces of pitta bread (for family of 4)? Tabouli terrible/ soggy and dissapointing, the parsley was almost minced, not chopped. The mixed grill was the only saving grace - a lamb chop, lamb kofta, chick and lamb skewer, all pretty good. The bigger concern was the service!!... we waited forever for our main (mixed grill). Two other tables who arrived and ordered 20 mins after us were served ahead of us! Def an issue with our order getting 'lost' or given to them in error... but no excuses; there was only 4 tables being used!... yet kitchen staff were all Flustered (through clear glass walls) abd not at all in order/Control. We had to sit and watch as the head waitress walked past up and down in her own 'flap' (...ignoring us as we tried to get her attention to order water!!) either yelling at the chef, or barking orders at the poor younger (learning)waiter . Not a good look to see arguing while you are ignored and kept waiting!! Much better places a few doors down, more traditional and less 'westernised' ... keep walking!
4
Went to this restaurant during weekday. Located right on the Arab st across the main street. One can sit indoor in the AC or outdoor depending on the weather. Food is awesome especially humus and kebab platter. Good and prompt service. Must go !
3
Lived in Dubai 5 years. I'm no expert but to me this was average at best. All of the dips tasted similar, nothing really jumped out and said delicious. Service was average too. Having said that the fresh pita bread was lovely. I'm sure better places in the area.
4
This place is in the middle of the Arab quarter in Singapore and it can often be a bit difficult to know which places are actually the good ones and which ones aren't. A friend recommended this place so we tried it out. Good hummus and bread baskets as a starter, some chicken sates after that with some rice and vegetables, we all liked everything we had. The atmosphere is very relaxed, the doors are open so it's really in a typical mediterranean style. So don't go there with your fancy clothes, just try it when you're absorbing the great atmosphere of the whole neigbourhood. All in all we liked the food, the service was very good and I can recommend it. After dinner, there's a ton of choices to go for drinks within 1-2min walking distance.
4
Nice smooth and tasty hummus in so many flavors! We ended up on the last day of Hummus festival, opting for Pepperika Hummus, which was delicious. Potato waffles had good flavor. Reasonably fast service, ok ambience and decent prices make this a good place for people who like Mediterranean food
5
We visited Arab St. for the first time and made reservations for four at Beirut. The food was authentic and tasted great. They have a dancer and music to add to the ambiance They also have aircon indoor seating or outdoor seating if you want to people watch. We will go again
4
We booked in at Beirut Grill on a Friday night after reading a recommendation about this restaurant and the Arabian quarter in a recent Qantas magazine. The restaurant was excellent, great service and food. Can highly recommend this place for quality food served in a traditional way. We did then venture onto the Haji shopping district, this wasnt as good, lots of bars (not much shopping which is what we were lead to believe Haji lane was about). The plus, great live music, the downside too many people smoking which didn't make it a pleasant experience. So have dinner a the Beirut Grill, but give Haji lane a miss
4
Beirut is one of the many middle-eastern restaurants in Kampong Glam and used to do a lot better when their sheesha bar/disc Magic Carpet was situated next door. They had a hummus special menu which had 10 odd hummus dishes such as Avocado, Paprika, Chicken Shawarma, Mint and other types of hummus. We got their platter and sampled the mint, avocado, chicken and paprika hummus combo. In most cases the taste of the hummus overpowered the flavouring and hence all tasted similar, the chicken was the only one that stood out. The potato started wasn't like it used to be - apparently they got feedback that the original preparation wasn't very Lebanese and hence they had modified to the new recipe, however, my friends who have been here before didn't like it. The Muhammara was the best of the appetizers that we had ordered.For mains we got one lamb kofte and a mussaka. The kofte was nice and served with caramelized rice, the mussaka wasn't as good. Overall the meal was good but not outstanding.
4
I was impressed by the street, It was full of people and joy. The food was good, especially the salads.
5
Have heard of this place from colleagues and would agree with them.. We had the cold mezze platter with the famous hummus and two types of eggplants dip.. For main we choose the signature dish "Lamb Chops" and oohhlalah ! It was amazingly bone licking good and goes well with a glass of red wine..Would highly recommend this place and get the lamb chops.. service was very good
4
Food was good. Service was a bit curt, but didn't take away from the experience. Music with the belly dancer was quite loud when seating outside
3
Visited this restaurant last weekend with 2 of my friends. Having grown up in Dubai, I've been exposed to some of the finest Lebanese restaurants there.The food at Beirut is good. I ordered Shish Tawook for main course and we ordered a plate of Hummus to share as starter. The hummus came with 1 piece of bread. I've never been to an Arabic restaurant that give one piece of small arabic bread to share between 3 people. And when we asked for 2 more they charged $4 which is an absolute rip-off.The waitresses seemed quite grumpy. And I wish I had gone to the restaurant next door where the staff seemed to welcome us way better. Overall food is good but I will never go there or take my friends there again
4
We had dinner on Saturday night, it was an enjoyable evening as the restaurant is located in a very lively street of Singapore. We had the falafels, hummus and kebab platter with several types of meats. It was really delicious !

My sister brought me here on my second night in Singapore and it did not disappoint! The restaurant has seating outside and places more tables out on the road on the weekends as the street is pedestrianised. Service was fine but the food, the food was incredible!! We had a sharing platter to start that came with pitta, falafel, hummus, babaganoush and some other salsa type dip (not sure what it was but it tasted great). The falafel was honestly the best I have tried. For mains we ordered the lamb kofta and shish Taouk, both of which came with spiced rice. We loved them both but if I had to choose one, I would recommend the Shish Taouk. My sister ordered a frozen margarita which wasn't very frozen at all but overall we had a wonderful time and would highly recommend it

You have to love Lebanese food -- always fresh, with lovely spices and herbs. it's hard not to get this right, so it's the little things that make a difference and it seems Beirut Grill is onto something. Little bit pricey compared to others, however you won't be disappointed
5
Lovely evening sitting outside. We started out with hummus bil-lahmeh. It was very tasty. Only improvement would be to serve more than 1 piece of pita bread with the bowl of hummus. For dinner, my husband and I split the mixed platter. It was delicious. Service was good for a Singapore restaurant as they came quickly to settle any needs when you waved for them. We had a really enjoyable evening
4
We had a great late lunch on Saturday, the menu has a little of everything with great flavors and good portions for all. Try a little something of everything. Take your time and enjoy

Back with my wife and friends from UK with their 2 kids and the place was busy. As usual salute' to the men in the kitchen.. as they can see we kept ordering the grilled haloumi and the mixed grilled platter is the best !Too bad the Lebanese Wine still out of stock so we end up having the Malbec..(again )..Lovely food,lovely place for a lovely dinner with special friends...service always at its best
1
We were a group of friends at this restaurant and never again will we come here! 6 of us got food poisoning (vomiting, diarrhea, fever, body aches etc) and when we approached the owner on this matter, he acted irresponsibly and blamed it on the cake we brought from outside. SOME OF US DID NOT EAT THE CAKE THEREFORE IT IS DEFINITELY THE RESTAURANT. We were not even requesting for him to refund us nor pay for our medical bills and yet he acted defensively and outrightly denied any wrongdoing. In conclusion, eat here if you possibly want food poisoning, and don't expect the owner to feel responsible for causing it. There are many other places in Singapore for good middle eastern.. there is no need to subject yourself to danger. We are taking this matter up with NEA anywa

When my family and I went for dinner, our party of 8 took a table inside the restaurant. This place is pricey for restaurant fare but not uncommon for our 'exotic' food. Besides our table, there were 3 other smaller tables. Our dishes came out quickly, and all of it tasted flavorful! It was difficult to share the food among 8 due to the table being a bit narrow for passing food around, but was still a pleasant dinner
4
I have returned and recommended this place many times for its food with great flavours, and its chilled vibes. Get a table outside and enjoy the buskers in the streets at the weekends. The falafels and baba ganoush are particular favourites which never disappoint. The baklava is a well kept secret too
4
Very Good place to eat Arabic Authentic Food..nice location...Must try falafel roll & chicken shawarma..
3
Visited this place after recommendation from local friends and good reviews. We ordered shish towk and another dish. Nothing to outstanding about the food considering that the food is it cheap. Service was good though.
4
Delicious eggplant baba ganoush, creamy falafel and fresh pitta.Walking around Arab Street was the calmest place for a late afternoon snack.Food is legit
4
Good food! Must try Lamb Kofta and Vegetarian Mousakka!! 😋 went here friday night.. not so crowded!
price was reasonable!
Very nice mediterranean ambience!
+belly dancer
+acoustic music playing nearby
+nice service from staff
5
This was a place with friendly service. Excellent falafel and lamb kebab. Really nice. It's in a very interesting part of the city. Would return !
5
Fabulous food typical of Lebanon beautifully cooked, and served could not fault, highly recommend . Fascinating Arab area of Singapore, allow time to explor
4
My first encounter with lebanese dinner and you guys just won my heart. One of the best food i ate in singapore. Everything ... just every damn dish we ordered was out of the world. Kitchen team- please pat your backs. I did not give 5 star only because of one of the table of around 8 pax which was way too noisy.... noisier than a hawker centre. It just killed our dinning experience. I know i am not at a fine dine restaurant but common there has to be some sort of control. Even the guest should realise that and behave but that doesnt take away the yummy food quality. M already planning my nxt dinner.:
4
Excellent range of tasty food for a group dinner. We had a great night out with a group of people who ate a range of eating desires from halal, vegetarian, meat eaters, drinkers and non drinkers and all were happy with this place. The food is well priced and portions are good. The added bonus of a belly Dancer on the Friday night for us was a great feature. Recommend upstairs as it has nice booths away from street level noises.
1
A quite dismal dinner in all fairness, pathetic and disinterested personnel make for a most unwelcome environment..Our starters and main courses were decidedly bland, a poor choice in a neighbourhood with much better options for Middle Eastern cuisine
5
One of the best things of having lived in the Middle East was eating Lebanese food, it's one of my favourites. This restaurant is really good; located parallel with Arab St it's pretty easy to find. The hummus is good and the chicken shawarma is gorgeous
1
We're not tourists - we live here. The food is ok. Not great, but more than acceptable. Booked a table for 5pax at 8:00pm, called ahead to say we'd be 15 mins late - no problem, so far so good... arrived 8:15, menus - all good. Then no one came back. After asking 3 times it took 30 minutes to get a drink. From there it got progressively worse. Having eaten great Lebanese in Beirut (the city) I'm biased, but my recommendation is don't go to this restaurant. There are plenty of alternatives nearby (some don't serve alcohol) but all much better than this I'm sorry to say...
4
Really enjoyed the dinner we had! We just had a big selection of starters, which were all great. A few 'awkward' appearances by the belly dancer added a little amusement to the evening too! Live music being played at the next door restaurant was excellent. Highly recommend sitting outside as the ambience was superb
4
A delightful choice for tasty and healthy middle-eastern cuisine in the Beach Road/Arab Mosque neighborhood of Singapore, especially on Saturdays and Sundays when Bussorah Street is closed to automobile traffic for pedestrian walking only. Outdoor and indoor dining are available at this charming restaurant which is an excellent alternative when you are looking for a unique dining experience, with good service and moderate prices.A must choice is the mixed grill kabob which nicely serves two persons and includes a saffron rice. I recommend ordering a side order of carrots, cucumbers and olives to accompany this delightful entree and 1664 Kronenburg Blanc white beer or sangria chilled wine, to accompany this special entree
5
Dinner with friends. We sampled the Kebab platter & spicy sausages and Tandoori Chicken. The food was amazing. We were seated on the first floor and was cosy ambience. The service was really good. The dessert was really great as well
3
We tried the foll dips, Baba ganoush, Moutabal, Hummus. Fatoush salad (which I didnt enjoy) and Falafel with Pita. so decent selection even for vegetarians but The Fatoush didnt deliver a punch as the pita pieces in it were not crispy enough
4
Great for a dinner before a night out in town. Centrally located and good food. Very unique for Singapore. Great food and enjoyable, in a real night spot
4
Though the food is quiet expensive, it is good! Service was also sufficient and friendly. Unfortunately the bill was not correct, so check before paying!

Last Saturday was our second time visit @ Beirut Grill with our guests from Italy..We had Labneh, babaghanos, falafel and haloumi for starters.. these are the starters i would say "YUMMYLICIOUS"..the Labneh would make you ask for more and we even almost licked the bowl :-)The falafel was served fresh and crispy.Haloumi added a great deal when served with fresh sliced tomatoe.Comes the best part of it was our main course; all recommended by the sweet lady who attended to us from the moment we wer seated up to the last minute..we had the Lamb chops( perfectly served as per my request med/well) lamb kofte(you can taste the smoky taste and spices)shish tok (chicken, lemony yet gave us a good kick of taste) and the tekke kebab( beef).The Lamb chops is the best! Its a must try for everyone..the lady promised me i would like it and indeed fell inlove with it..Also,they have a good list of wines. For starters we wer recommended to have white wine and a beer; for our meats the lady recommend us a red wine.. she knew very well which goes well with our food..Service was up to my expectations! We had enjoyed our dinner and we left with a promise of coming back again..Great food, good place, friendly staff AND the belly dancer is an additional touch to enjoy the evening

We visited this place today for lunch. Firstly this is not an authentic Arab restaurant. It is run by Indians who have little idea how to make Middle Eastern food. We ordered 3 plates of chicken shawarma and two glasses of juice. The chicken was basically 'achaar' chicken, an Indian dish made with pickled chicken. Shawarma is never made with Indian species. It came with some fries and tartar sauce. When we asked for bread the waitress asked us if we want pita or Italian bread. No authentic middle eastern eatery will ever ask you that: they will simply offer you freshly made hot bread. The bombshell was the bill. For the above mentioned items we were charged 73SGD!!! This was more expensive than an full day hop-on hop-off bus ticket. Needless to say, we will never recommend this restaurant. Spare yourself the trouble and avoid the place.
4
Great service, amazingly fresh food and a lovely vibe. The wine list is good, the cocktails are made well. We ordered the Mezzo platter and the grilled meat platter and it feed 3 of us easily. The labneh is to die for, try it even if you have never had it before
3
Ended up at Beirut Grill tonite, as Arab restaurant I visited frequently many years ago was no more. Food was good, but a bit strange with boiled cauliflower, beans and to the dish. I had the Beirut Lamb Chops with typical middle-eastern rice.The Homos was great, tasted great, and was nicely made. The Pita bread was somehow too small, so you need two to go with the dish. The atmosphere was nice, and the service great. You was quickly attended to
4
Had tasty lamb mousakaa - sat outside with food & glass of proseco. Pleasant staff, tasty food & good value
4
Very nice food and service, comfy, but may improve on ambient cleanliness. A good start is a Beirut Mezza Platter, enough for four as a starter.
2
I have been to Beirut a few times and because the time that passes in between is quite long, I keep forgetting that even though the food is quite alright, it is still pretty overpriced - and you don't leave satiated.The latest visit I made a reservation, turned up to find that they didn't bother to arrange a table to suit the number of people I made a reservation for. (Made a reservation for 9, they set a table for 8 - I know it's only one less but when you've already put in the effort to set it for 8, is it really a stretch to make it the actual 9?)It took a while to get the staff's attention to place our orders. The food was not too bad - I've always enjoyed their food fairly well and the rice that they serve is really yummy. When it came to getting the bill, the waitress asked if she could clear our table first before she gave us the bill. I wasn't really happy with that because - 1. We were sitting around for a while contemplating whether to get dessert there so she could've cleared the table earlier. 2. We were still hungry so we just wanted to quickly head elsewhere for dessert. 3. We were a table of 9, there would've been a lot of clearing to do.We ended up asking another staff for the bill, who delivered promptly.For those looking for a halal restaurant, please note that they serve alcohol within the restaurant premises
2
This is on a very lively and nice street. Stopped here for healthy food, but the quality of food was not so special. Had a table outside so could enjoy the live music of the restaurant next door. Service ok. Prices little high
5
This is a busy restaurant in a side street not far from the mosque - well worth finding. I stumbled upon it when wandering around in the Arab quarter looking for a restaurant that served beer. The food was fantastic - serve was ok but it was very busy that night. And I wasn't in a rush. I had hummus to start and the lamb chops. I would definitely try the chops - they were delicious. Well worth a visit
5
We ordered fried haloumi, lamb, calamari and signature chicken dish. Was a fantastic meal. Lots of flavor. Would go back. Service was friendly too
3
A group of 8 went for lunch. We are a lively group but certainly not difficult to please. We all enjoyed the food. Some of us are vegetarians and there was enough on the menu to please. The food came out in good time and it was delicious. The only thing I can fault was the service. It wasn't busy but the attitude of the waitress was not the best. No greetings, no "what would you like to drink", no "are you ready to order". It was quite an achievement getting her attention and when we did ..... wow talk about captain of the Happy Team!. All she wanted to do is play on her phone. The young man was slightly better but certainly was not a happy camper either. I know that its common for staff to be on their phones these days but it really annoys me (call me old fashioned). If the service picks up I'll be back for sure
4
We enjoyed a very good meal at this restaurant. The food was incredibly good, cannot fault it one bit. Reason I did not give it 5 stars is it was not very well organised as a restaurant. One person took the drinks order, another the meal order, second person thought we had already ordered. Service slow and on the bill they left our drinks off. Asked them to put the drinks on (ethically cannot walk away if noticed) and they only put some of the drinks on the bill. Couldn't be bothered to explain for a third time.
4
Went there yesterday the first time. The various dishes that we had were all pretty tasty and good quality. The service was ok. We were pleasantly surprised by the performance of a belly dancer during the evening. The prices were allright. Not the best Libanese restaurant i have been but overall pretty good performance
3
I ordered the lamb chop grill. It was delicious. Easy to find the restaurant. I went there around 7-8pm and hard to find a seat. It was crowded. The staffs are friendly and helpful
2
The food is not exactly what i would call authentic lebanese/arabic. Flavour wise It was just ok and at times bland. Not the best but neither the worst Lebanese I've had but nothing too exciting to make me want to go back again. The babaganoush was tasteless. The muhammara was too spicy. The fattoush had no toasted or fried pieces of pita brea, no lemon juice and no mint. I've never seen balsamic vinegar being added to a Fattoush salad?! This was a first for me (and hopefully a last). Price wise, it is not value for money. The shish taouk costs SDG 20 without tax and service charge. What comes on the plate is about 6 small pieces of chicken (barely 1 skewer) with some vegetables which we found ridiculous (we asked for veg instead of rice). Although the flavour was nice, the chicken was not succulent or tender as its supposed to be. We also ordered 2 of the 'Lime Breeze's' which apparently was a fresh lime juice drink blended with fresh mint leaves and ice. This was SGD 8.5 per drink, I should add. Charging SGD 8.5 (Lime Breeze) for a lime juice out a carton, blended with some ice and a couple of mint leaves is outright wrong. There is no way that the lime juice used was fresh and there was barely any mint in the drink.All in all, rather disappointing and not somewhere I will want to ago again. Unfortunately the quest for finding a good and authentic Lebanese/Middle Eastern restaurant in Singapore continues..
5
We shared a vegetarian and a seafood platter between three. I t was beautifully cooked, unusual, flavoursome fresh food and the service great. Reasonably priced, it was a special experience for us all.. Exotic feel and great decor added to a fabulous evening
4
Easy dinner on Chinese new year with my wife. Food good value and very nice and we'll cooked. Little slow on service but probably as we seemed to arrive at about the same time as lots of other people. Would recommend for a nice dinner.
2
Very rare to see such tired, exhausted staff. You'd wave to ask for something and you could see a little of them die inside. We only managed a successful order on the third go because they kept running out of things. The final meal - lamb shish - was clearly the leftovers. The meat was dry, cold, and it's a shame because the basicquality looked fine. The plates, half eaten, were cleared away with the same maudlin disinterest with which they were originally presented. We left. Somewhere a tumbleweed blew.

We have been coming to Beirut for years and loving it. Tonight we took some out of town guests and were beyond disappointed, bordering on horrified. I won't even get into the loud, incongruous pop music which we had to ask them to turn down. We ordered the mezzanine plate, a stand by for an appetizer, which was actually very good except for the shocking new 'bread' served with it: not the lovely authentic Turkish bread I remember, but a dry, totally white tasteless pita, puffed and utterly flavorless, like a stale freezer version of over processed faux pita. For me inedible. We anticipated lamb cutlet and lamb shwarma, after prompting the Filipina waitress to ask us how we'd like the meat cooked. She didn't understand the request for cooking preference at first... We requested medium rare which seemed a novelty request. The shwarma came and was great. The cutlets were fright red, tikka style, not the lovely perfect grilled cutlets I recall, and were black and burned on the outside, blue and cold raw on the inside. Inedible, we had to send them back. They re emerged idental. The accompanying boiled cauliflower, green beans and boiled carrots slices I might encounter on a commercial Jetstar airline meal: again inedible. Cafeteria- style portions of upside down teacup-molded rice sealed the overall TV-dinner look and taste. The poor Filipino belly dancer was appalling, and added to the sad ambience of in-authenticity. The food is churning in my stomach even as I write this: but the clincher was my trip to the restroom before our departure. The stench in the dual-gender hovel was unbearable. The cupboards are hanging off their hinges and visibly filthy. A huge rubbish bin, also stained and filthy fills the space between loo and sink: making navigation to hand washing virtually impossible. In any restaurant: if the loo is filthy, honestly what conclusion can you draw about the kitchen? Massive disappointment. Although it has been a fave for 10 years, I definately won't be back. Shame on the corner-cutters. So many are like you...

It's not that easy to find a good Lebanese restaurant in Arab Street. Lucky we found one .. Food was great, we tried the hummus, the mixt grill plater, spicy sausages for kibbeh and the vegetarian mussaca and the service was very kind and not pushy I really recommend this place if you want to enjoy good Lebanese food
3
I and my friend were the only customers on a week day lunch. The place gets busier for dinner. The ambience is nice but that's about it. Mezze plate has little kick. I ordered chicken and it was disappointing. I think it targets tourists. Needs to improve if it wants to attract locals
2
Arab Street is an attractive low-rise part of Singapore, so we thought we might try the local Lebanese food, which had reasonable ratings (4.1). The food was pleasant enough but not really authentic. Our lunch comprised Hummus, Tabouleh, Shish Taouk and Kofte. The Hummus was fine but the Tabouleh was over-chopped, with too little oil and lemon making it a sludge and served with orange! The chicken was ok if small and dry but served with mayonnaise instead toom, and the Kofte was over-minced and under-cooked. Not truly offensive but about as Lebanese as the staff
4
We had a most enjoyable evening at Beirut Lebanes restaurant. Hommus and pita bread followed by a delightful mixed grill share plate. All very tasty. We were also entertained by the belly dancer and a street singer nearby. A relaxed and friendly staff ensured good service. Only real issue was house wine at $50 and expensive beer, a pity that restaurants in Singapore do this given that many visitors would enjoy a few cold beers
4
We came here to the Arab Street area to have a family lunch. Service was very efficient and friendly. Outside was very warm so it was nice to enter the cool of the restaurant.The staff served the food quickly and it was perfect with the breads fresh out of the oven. This is a halal restaurant but the meat on offer is wonderful. The signature chicken dish is fabulous as are the spicy sausages. Portion sizes are just right and the price is good too. There is a great selection of interesting vegetarian dishes as well so many dietary choices are available.The Arabic coffee is a treat too, prepared the traditional way and poured at your table. Perfect finish to the meal.We thought the restaurant was very clean and felt cozy and comfortable with great food and will come back
1
I was shocked how dirty this place is.The canopy curtain was ebcrusted with filth,the chairs bursting from their covers and the back curtain stained with grease beyond belief.Huge balls of dust and grime hang down above you.It makes you worry about the kitchen where a sole Singaporean looking chef trties his best to cook Lebanese food.Quite honestly we were so put off by the state of this place we lost our appetite.The obviosly pre made falafel was stodgy,the kofta ok and the lentil soup ok.The beer was warm and the service was derisory given how empty this place was.I cannot see it lasting much longer 
3
I went to the restaurant Saturday night, the service was very poor. For me the price was ok and the food portions were good. The chicken shawarma was very spicy. I eat Lebanese food anywhere I go and it didn't taste like a Lebanese shawarma. I hope this gets improved in the future
4
This place offers a real middle east menu with plenty of dishes...it is really a good alternative in Singapore.
4
Food was delicious. Service is good. Ambience was perfect.
We ordered the mix grill. In my opinion, the meat was cooked very well and the taste was great.
Only downside to this place is that it doesn't serve kunafe :(
4
Lively restaurant with a good menu for food and drinks. I only had a starter but the quality and flavour of the food was exceptional. I'd happily go back next time I visit Singapore.
4
I ate here during my last visit to Singapore and was not disappointed so decided to eat there again. Unfortunately i can't remember what the name of the dish was that my sister had!! I do know it was a mixture of hummus and vegetable and was lovely. I had the chicken wrap which was very tasty. The restaurant isn't huge - quite cosy. The only thing worth mentioning is the air conditioning unit that was above me... it was leaking (i noticed this last time) so every now and then I could feel drops of water on my legs. As we were 2 people on a table for 4 I was able to move over but it does need to be sorted. Good value for money !! I'd still go back ;-
1
The food is average. The service sucks. The cleanliness of this place is questionable. The waitress who was serving me screamed while I was eating because she saw a critter near her under the table. I am not sure what she saw but I bet it was not supposed to be there! Trust me, you can do better elsewhere. I did not even get a water refill while I was eating
2
Service was very efficient but food left a lot to be desired.The baby ghanoush had been undercooked. The muharamma was dominated by the chillies in it. The chicken shwarama platter was the worst. Stir fried chicken rather than sliced grilled chicken. They provide flavoured mayonnaise rather than tahini or the garlic sauce. Decided not to risk beirut for dessert and headed to the French restaurant next door.
4
This restaurant offers a wide selection of dishes. The lamb cubes in the Sish Kebab I ordered was soft, succulent with just the right amount of smoky flavour. The service was a bit slow though and could have been friendlier. Admittedly it was nearing closing time, but the waitress seemed too eager to make sure that the last batch of customers finish their meals, pay their bills and leave
3
I had chicken shawarma roll and it was a little too small and a little too spicy for me. A spiciness indicator on the menu would be great.Also had a white Russian cocktail, was nice tasting just very small considering it was $12.Overall an OK experienc
1
I went out with my wife for a kids free dinner. We already tried few nice Italian and Turkish restaurants in the area all were pretty good. The Turkish restaurant Darwish if I'm correct of the way out spelled, food was nice but the place was really dirty and no alcohol.Beirute grill looked clean, staff are lovely but the food was very average I will go back for drink but not for foo
5
My partner and I were in the area and decided to give Beirut Grill a try. We ordered the Beirut Mezzo Platter, Grilled Lamb Chops and "Morgan Freezeman" (Lime, Mint and Rum Freeze) - all dishes recommended by the restaurant manager, Baljit (who was very charismatic and personable!). Everything we ordered was beautifully done, marinated well and seasoned to perfection! Wouldn't have changed a thing! From the smokey eggplant dip, to the hummus with its bright citrusy flavour, to its perfectly grilled lamb chops with delicious savoury rice. HIGHLY recommended for any local or person visiting Singapore if they are looking for great Middle Eastern fare
4
Light lunch with the better half. A flavoursome salad and a mixed kebab. Absolutely delicious with a cold beer. Friendly and relaxed service. Would def go again
5
Great dinner, could not fault it, cocktails were great, food was very enjoyable we had the meat plater, sausage starter , mezzo plater and chargrilled prawns...... Delicious , staff were friendly and speedy.
Will be coming back next year.... Thanks for a great evening
5
I had dinner
That is a good place to eat middle eastern food and service staff so helpful and polite...
2
The food was OK, nothing special. The meat in the mixed grill was a bit chewy. The service was very poor and tested our patience. We went around 5pm so it wasn't busy but it took ages to take our order and serve our food. Given there are so many restaurants to choose from, I think you have better options in the area.
3
The service was very good, I would give it 5 starsThe food was almost authentic, the hummus had the right texture and flavour, a bit too much citric acid ( did not taste like real lemon juice) and the oil was not "extra virgin olive oil" as advertised in the menu, the oil tasted like generic salad oilEgg plant dip was not fresh and had too much tahina, it was not bad either, but no reason to go backFalafel was hot and ok, not great, I have had much better and much much worseOverall the food was average at best, but for the price you would expect a lot more5 star price for 3 star foodI doubt I will be back

I make a point of visiting Beirut Grill each time I visit Singapore. The restaurant is right across the road from the Park Royal on Beach Road where I have stayed a number of times.I have previously enjoyed my visits immensely; the harissa potatoes, mezze platter, spicy sausages and chicken shish taouk have consistently been excellent quality with my guests always agreeing with me that this is a great place for a meal.During a recent visit i was really very disappointed. Some of the food was still very good but the chicken was of poor quality during this visit. The head on the beer was huge and even then, there was a substantial gap at the top. After pointing this out, I was simply laughed off. The beer didn't seem quite right anyway, maybe it was the end of the barrel or perhaps the lines just need cleaned?I really hope that the previously high standards and obtained again soon; I would hate to cross this out of places to visit in Singapore. On a good food day - the food really is excellent, but the price is way too high for there to be even one bad food day..
2
I used to love this place and used to come here a lot with freinds and family. I went there 2 weeks ago and found the waiters (women) was supremely rude and very curt. The orders we placed got messed up. They brought us leomanade instead of labneh. the labneh was sour and awful. the overall quality of the food has become very bad. Dont know if its because the owner has a new outlet but he better fix this
5
Beirut Grill is a wonderful taste of the Middle East in the Arab quarter of Singapore. The staff were welcoming and attentive, taking time to discuss the menu and meet our particular dietary needs and culinary desires. The menu is broad without providing too much choice. The atmosphere was tremendous. Value for money
1
We went for dinner with friends on a Tuesday night (July 21st 2015) and despite it being a weekday night when the restaurant was not busy at all the service to be quite lacking. A number of food items we ordered mezze platter and Foul were average, portion size of dishes small and meat kebab platter and Vegetarian Moussaka were quite poor.What is appalling is that we brought poor quality of Moussaka to the attention of our waitress and restaurant manager and asked it to be taken back. They gladly took it back with no apologies and didn't even remove the dish from our bill. We are never going back to this place - plenty other places in Arab Street to try
3
Husband and I tried the Beirut Grill for the first dinner in Singapore as we stayed at a nearby hotel. The service was ok, nothing to write home about. I ordered the Beirut Lamb Chops and I was eagerly awaiting this dish as I love lamb. I was disappointed as the lamb was slightly overcooked and a bit dry. The accompaniment of rice was cold as was the sauteed veges. For the price I was less than impressed as it was S$27. My husband had the Mousakaa Chicken S$17 which he enjoyed . We also got a side of homemade pita bread S$2 and Hummus S$8. The hummus was slightly lemony but everywhere makes their own recipe. We both had lime juice for drinks but cannot remember the price. Overall the whole experience was OK, but nothing fantastic
4
Was our first visit to the Arab street. nice hospitable staff.. good food. crowd visiting the place is also good. However the fatoush was somewhat different from thr traditional Arabic one. well.placed on the street
5
Beirut grill is best place to eat Middle Eastern...I had good service experience with them..food was excellent and staff also very attentive
4
This was our first experience eating near Arab Street and it was successful. One of our party had ordered the leg of lamb 24 hours before, and we turned the rest of the ordering over to the waiter/owner. Delicious lamb, couscous, humus, kebab and lime drinks. All delicious and came to $60 per couple. Will return with friends! Interesting too to see and hear the nearby mosque

It was the usual Saturday evening meetup with The Beau, and we decided to go for something exotic and different this evening - Middle Eastern / Lebanese cuisine. After browsing through the rows of restaurants along Arab Street / Haji Lane, we decided on Beurut Grill located at Bussorah Street.This charming two-storey restaurant boosts of an enchanting setting upstairs, which was where we were seated. It was named "Magic Carpet Lounge" and was complete with drapes and mirrors to give the place a rather romantic appeal. If I ever had any doubts on the phrase "dark sultry Arabian nights", tonight my doubts were cleared.For food, we shared the Mixed Grilled Kebab (SGD$36.00), consisting of lamb chops, lamb kebab kofta, tikka kebab, shish taouk served with grilled vegetables and Oriental Arabic rice. Needless to say, the meat were all grilled to a delicious, nearly-crispy state, so that in their tenderness or chewiness, there was that lovely, consistent smokey hint giving the assorted meat an extra enhancer. The rice was a flavors burst with the fragrance of herbs / spices.Time to wolf down an exotic dessert now. We chose the Oum Ali (SGD$12.00) to share - fresh cream pudding with yellow raisins, nuts, coconut and crispy flakes served with honey and pistachio. It was a hot dessert, The texture was noticeably smooth and the taste was a lovely, sweet creaminess with lots of crunch in between bites.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/04/dinner-at-beirut-grill-middle-eastern.htm

Beirut Offers a wide range of authentic middle eastern dishes with unique spices and combinations. Cozy ambience with welcoming service crews. The Lamb Chops is their house special is a must try! And dont miss the best Sangria in town along with our special craft cocktails served at Magic Carpet Lounge right above Beirut Grill

Me & my friends went to visit Beirut Grill for the first time on a Saturday night. We didn't made any reservations & the place was extremely busy. it was really obvious that they were short of staff. There was a long line of hungry souls waiting outside to be seated. There was this lady staff wearing a black vest. She must be in her late 30's and she was extremely helpful to find us seats at the outdoor area. She managed to get most the people in line seats within just a few minutes.We've heard great reviews about the food & much to our pleasure, the food was orgasmic. Literally finger licking good. We had the mezze platter that we really enjoyed for starters. The falapel is a must try as well as the moutabal *drools*. The delicious bread which was fresh was amazing. The main star of the meal was of course the main dish. We had the beirut lamb chops and shesh touk. (I apologize if I'm spelling the dishes wrong) The rice with the 3 sauce is a match made in heaven with the juicy kebabs.Dessert was extremely pleasant. We had the baklava & the signature hot mint tea (Unfortunately we had to wait a really long time for the tea)The female staff outside was very attentive and sweet..the guys however were slightly aloof while doing their service.Nevertheless our experience with the food and the place was good .Service wise was slow (as we observed they're short of staff ) but we appreciate the way the lady staff in the black vest apologized to us profusely. She was the one who recommended the dishes as well. She must be the manager for her to be so professional and friendly. We'll definitely come back again & hopefully we can try the sheesha & watch the belly dancing. We'll recommend Beirut to our friends definitely. Other than the awesome food, please look out for the lady staff with the black vest. We couldn't catch her name but we definitely will the next time we come over. Lastly, I hope this establishment would work out on their staff issue. This place would be perfect if they worked on getting more staff. Treat your staff like how you treat your customers as they're also valuable assets to the establishment

the staff are clearly making am effort. Still falls short, both in terms of food and service which is extremely slow...

Excellent Lebanese food in nice surroundings . Waiting staff pleasant. Authentic menu very reasonably priced.Worth a visit if you have "noodled out "on Chinese, Thai etc.Good vegetarian option
3
Food is good. Service can definitely improve. Plain water was filled up in all tables except mine. Everytime they walked past they seemed to ignore my table which was kinda weird. Even before i was done with the falafel, waitress cleared my plate even without asking. The restaurant definitely needs more fans or at least turn on both the aircons when customers are around. I was sweating away while eating. Quite unpleasant for an anniversary dinner

Beirut is a great fun place to go with a group and the food is delicious. The staff were excellent and attentive without being intrusive. Highly recommended and the labna is a must
3
Was expecting much more but it really was a disappointing evening. Poor service & average food. Arab street is a cool spot to hang out but there have to be better options than Beirut.
4
This is a great find - small and intimate but fab food. We had the mezze platter, tabouleh and lahem meshwi all of which were yummy
5
Once again I visited Beirut with teammates for a dinner with one of the visitor. We were about 10 people. The service was good. The staff was quite helpful every time someone needed help in choosing the menu. The atmosphere was nice and friendly nature of staff made our evening quite enjoyable. The food was good. We ordered mainly platters to cater to different peoples taste. All the dishes were very well cooked. The quantity as I said in my previous reviews is also very good. The peta bread and the different sauce served with platers had a unique middle eastern feel to it. The Humous (chickpeas paste) and falafal are my favorites along with the cheese roll. Although there are very few options for vegetarians, the available dishes are very good. You will not be disappointed. This place is slowly becoming regular for me & my team when we want to go to Arab street. All the visits so far have been good & I will visit again in future.

Went lunching with colleagues to Beirut Grill. We ordered a mix and match of things; a couple of set lunches, a Falafel Roll, and & Mushroom Spaghetti. We also had different Martinis and a Mai Tai to drink - Friday lunches are perfect with Martinis! The food was decent, flavoursome, and good on portion sizes. The Falafel felt a little dry but that seems to be quite common in eateries in Singapore. The service is a plus, friendly and accommodative. The soup of the day was Chicken, but they were happy to do a Vegetable one on the set lunch for Vegetarians. The prices are reasonable too, worth a visit

Feedback from a Lebanese person:Beirut is a restaurant that serves pretty genuine Lebanese food and the taste is as good as some of the best restaurants in Lebanon, Although some dishes are not traditional and seem to be made up (i.e. the spicy sausages disn), they still taste very Lebanese in terms of spices. The prices are very fair for the market, especially considering the food quality (except for the hookah, 45 sgd++ is insanely high).The only food that disappointed me is the Pita bread, it did not feel fresh, maybe it is too hard to have that in Singapore.The service however can be improved. The staff could use a little more smiling. One other comment is about the way the Pita bread is served, it comes in limited quantity with certain dishes and has to be then ordered separately, the price is 2 sgd++ which is not much, however the feeling of rationed quantity and needing to ask for more bread kind of kills the Lebanese spirit of hospitality, where you would expect generosity which does not cost much over something like bread.For the taste and food quality, recommended restaurant

Lebanese food is something that you tend to crave once in awhile for - and when that craving hit some friends we decided to hit up Beirut.I do prefer Lebanese personally over the other middle eastern cuisines because of the fresher, lighter and veggie rich options available.We headed to Beirut not expecting something great - all we wanted was a decent, hearty Lebanese meal.To that extent Beirut delivers very well. The food is nice and well prepared and authentic enough. It's not exactly inventive or inspiring but hey that's not what we wanted.We ordered some dips ( they had a very good Muhammara spicy peppers dip - which is actually very Syrian) and were quite happy with those and the fresh and hot Pita. But I always feel overcharged when someone charges me for Pita - it's like buying the bread in a French restaurant ! That should be free flow - the mezze and dips are good quality though.We also ordered the spinach pastries, falafel, some kebab and veggies and also the balaclavas.All good - again not superb or great even - but for that area it was not bad - in fact one of the way better ones I have had in the Kampong Glam area.I do wish they either put up a proper stage for the belly dancer or stop it - it's a little sad to see the poor girl trying her best and having to push her out onto the Alfresco area for lack of space !The service was good and professional , with smiles which seemed a tad tired and forced ( that alas is what one has come to expect of most places here in Singapore so this was par for the course ).All in all go for a good decent meal which is moderate on your pocket - and while you are there walk around to soak in the Arab street's bohemian ambience, sip some Turkish coffee or Arabian tea and if you want some some sheesha. That will certainly make the good great

This was my 2nd visit to Beirut Grill. First time I had been here with a group of colleagues for dinner. Today I visited with family for the lunch. On both occasions the place was not crowded & we could choose the place we wanted to sit. The service was quick. The food we ordered was all vegetarian dishes. Starting with the mezzo platter. The quantity was good. In the main course we ordered a gravy with ladyfinger (okra). This time also the quantity was nice. It was bit salty. We requested the rice which is served normally this gravy to be replaced by pita bread. We ended up ordering 2-3 additional breads. These were served hot and they tasted really nice. I would recommend this place. I am sure i will visit this place again just because of those lovely breads
3
Nice decor, reasonable food, but just exorbitantly overpriced... $14 SGD for a small tabouleh - seriously... :-PWould have come back if the food was amazing, but for average to OK food, the prices were ridiculous..

I have been to Beirut Grill several times. A great place for social gathering, Beirut Grill and Magic Carpet has a nice decor with a cosy feel. Their menu has expanded humbly, now boasting a more variety selection of meats and vegetarian dishes. While I have tried some of their main courses, I was particularly attracted to the variety of dips they offer.Apart from the usual Hummus, Beirut Grill offers Moutabbal (chargrilled egglant puree, mixed with sesame paste and lemon juice, topped with extra virgin olive oil) and Baba Ghanoush (similar to Moutabbal but with mixed vegetables instead of sesame paste), Hummus Paprika (hummus spiced with paprika and tahini) and my top pick would be; Labneh (hanged yogurt topped with extra virgin olive oil and thyme). Labneh tastes similar to creamy smooth cheese. It is not too "cheesy" and you can taste the hints of olive oil and herbs. And when served with their hot fresh out-of-the-oven pita bread, it's two thumbs up and finger-licking good!If you are not into meaty main course, then I would suggest the Beirut Mezza Platter. It comes with 3 types of dips, cheese rolls and crunchy, flavourful falafel. A perfect snack/meal to go with with friends and family while enjoying the cosy ambience and soaking in the Middle Eastern feel
4
This is the place were you come to chill and enjoy the good food. The food is different that your Asian or western food. The flavours(herbs and spices) used makes the food taste nice and unique. The atmosphere in the restaurant was relaxing where you feel like just chilling there for a long. Had a business dinner and the colleagues love the restaurant and the food.
5
Beirut grill is a side street restraunt on Arab the decor is amazing and the service is great it's really nice and the food is to die for
5
I had lunch with a friend and I must admit, it exceed my expectations. Quickly served with fresh ingredients and staff was efficient and fast with the orders. I would go back for sure.
4
Been to Beirut a couple of
times and we always have an enjoyable time...good music and ambience plus excellent service from staff that make an effort to remember their patrons by name.
4
Was passing through Singapore from Australia on my return to the UK, and stumbled across Beirut after getting dropped off in Arab St. Had a great time, food was good and service was brilliant. Particularly enjoyed the Muhammara and the chicken from the Mixed Grill Kebab
3
As we approached the restaurant we were first asked if we had prior reservations to which we said no. so they said we would have to sit on the first floor, which by the way is much better than sitting outside or on the ground floor, so it struck me as odd as to why wouldn't a restaurant choose to market its most cosiest seats to its most favourable guest?we ordered A cup of mint tea, a latte, a mezze platter and a vegetarian Mousakaa and an Aum Ali for desert.I asked the waiter what a specific type of tea on the menu meant, he said he had no idea and had to check with the bartender and then her forgot about it for ten mintues and later my partner had to ask him and then he comes back with an answer its not available rather than explaining what kind of tea it was. so I ask him if i can get coffee with milk, he says he will check and then comes back and asks if latte will work instead? there is a huge difference between a latte and a coffee with milk so anyway I decide to have a latteThe tea arrives first and then the coffee but then the sugar a bit later.we then get our starter which was delicious but then two people have to eat a mezze platter with 1 spoon and there are no side plates or forks. so we ask for forks but do not get side plates.The main course arrives, once again no side plates so we ask for them, they bring 1 side plate instead of two ( the expectation from the waiter is that one of us have to eat from the large plate and another from the side plate)Our desert takes approx 25 minutes after we've have our main course. we try to attract the waitress attention, she pretends not to notice us. we confront the waitress about why she is avoiding us and ask about the desert. we wait another 10 minutes for the desert.Once again the experience of this restaurant is destroyed by lousy pathetic service and 70+ dollars for this is overpriced and a waste of time.Hugely avoidable place, stay away
5
The first thing you notice about Beirut grill is the lovely atmosphere and the friendly staff. I have been over 50 times now and the food is great and at a reasonable price
4
Exceptional food, accompanied by warm and personable staff. One of the best restaurants for Middle Eastern food in Singapore, situated in a historic and charming neighbourhood. The ambience surroundind the outdoor seating is unique. Snugly tucked upstairs is the intimately laid-out "Magic Carpet," a quaint bar, packed with noisy revellers on weekends, dancing to beats that vary from bollywood to zumba
1
The waitresses were extremely rude. Kept running only to tables that had all men (obviously). Never coming back and definitely telling my friends to stay away
5
This is a lovely location facing the Asian Civilization Museum. It is easy to miss this restaurant because it is surrounded on all sides by mediocre restaurants of all nationalities. However the ingredients at Beirut were absolutely fresh and delicious. The service was excellent, and the ambiance was pleasant. The Lebanese menu offered excellent choices for vegetarians and meat eaters alike
2
My husband and I had long heard about Arab street in Singapore and the authentic Arab food you get there. So we were quite excited to go there and have Lebanese food...Unfortunately, the experience fell flat. The decor of the place was alright. However, despite having open tables, the staff seated us very close to the till so our personal space was always invaded by people waiting for a table and waiting to pay the bill. Moreover, the food was pricey and did not meet the standards. The taste was not genuinely Lebanese and quite a few of the dishes had excesses of lemon in them. My husband had ordered their mixed grill plater...the priciest item on the menu....and let me be frank....the meat was too dry and they were very very small portions....he had to order another dish...just to fill him up.....and he is not obese or anything....I on the other hand had a shawarma....very small and cut in half....never seen that before....again the meat was too dry but the sauces inside made it a bit better than the mixed grilled platter. However, since the portion was small I was left hungry.Moreover the drinks we had were terrible. I had ordered a watermelon juice and all I got was some mildly pink glass with a small piece of watermelon floating in it and lots of ice. I felt I had drank a glass full of pink water. My husband had a tiger beer...which was not cold. We paid our tab and left after having an extremely disappointing experience! For a restaurant touting to have great Lebanese food....they didn't even have the basic things right and pricey to boot
5
The food was great, always improving to the best. Service and staff very friendly, relaxing. Great music and drinks.
3
Been here twice. Outstanding the first time, food not as good the second. Service a little slow but otherwise excellent. Tasty hummus. Nice lamb kofta.
4
nice belly dance by a good looking girl at intervals. food is good but the potions are a bit small. recommend lamb chops. there is a bar call Magic Carpet upstairs which you can enjoy shisha.
4
It's one of those experience you never forget in visiting a country with so much to offer. You try to find new meaning to food and how it would take you to the next level.  My friends and I have heard of this place and thought we should give it a try and see as well the bustling mix of culture in the area.  Much to our delight, the mezza, mixed seafood, and grilled platters burst with flavors. It's as if you're taken to a different place and time. I love the veggies (fattoush is so good) and dips (hummus and labneh - must try) with the homemade bread. The flavors are pronounced and unique to taste. Shish taouk, lamb chops and chicken tandoori will surely make you come back for more. Trully awesome for our first Lebanese adventure
2
By far, the most distasteful lebanese cuisine I have ever had. We were seated at a table so uncomfortably high, when trying to rest our elbows, we looked like live chickens waiting for slaughter. We ordered the common entres - hummus, babaghanoush, mutabbal and tabbouleh. The tabbouleh had too much lemon in it making it terribly sour. The hummus was just bland and we couldnt tell the difference between babaghanoush and mutabbal. When one of the waitresses was asked, she incorrectly named one of the other entres as hummus - when hummus is most commonly known! For our main course, we had grilled lamb which was so difficult to finish. Save yourself from embarrassing your guests and eat somewhere else
1
Compelled to write this after 15minutes of sitting down. Walk in, sit down, lady throws menus at our table and walks off. Server was also utterly unhelpful when ordering. Asked where the toilet was... Lady walked past grunted and pointed. Second time of visiting and don't remember this being the case. The Arab quarters area is too competitive to provide this. Very disappointed. If the person who owns this place reads these suggest you at least have staff that greet customers. Would be a great start.

Our family had a dinner at Beirut Grill on the night of July 27, we made reservation for 4 people at 8.30pm. The restaurant was not empty but certainly was not full when we came in. The server look so harassed and show us to the table. For drink, my daughter wanted a glass of water and the rest of us order cokes n juices. She was given Fiji water. Drinks were only given to us after waiting of a good 20 minutes. Other table came in before us got served glasses of water right away, not branded water. We have to try to get the server's attention to place our order. Two other tables got to order before us even though the came after us. When finally food arrived, of course order was wrong. Then we have to wait again. Meanwhile servers try their best not to meet your eyes so you cannot ask them anything. Food were mediocre, nothing to wrote home about. Falafels were burnt. My husband asked for water, the waiter fill water into his coke's glass, because there were no more glasses and she has to bring them from upstairs, whatever that means. Experience was so unpleasant it gave a very bad taste in our mouth. Servers were so harassed and made us feel that we were a mere nuisance. There is no service spirit what so ever. Definitely will not come back and definitely will not recommend it to anyone. Both my husband and I worked for prestigious 5 stars hotel in Singapore, we will definite will not recommend Beirut Grill to our guests
1
I am a big fan of Lebanese food so was really looking forward to this meal. The food was really disappointing. We ordered traditional dishes like Humous, baba ganoush and breads and they were all poor. The main meal continued in the same vain. Edible but nothing to write home about. Halfway through the meal a cockroach was waling up the wall behind my friend and the lady beside me was getting quite upset about it but the staff did not seem concerned. Towards the end of the dish my friend's wife found pieces of tissue in her meal and when this was pointed out to the staff it was greeted with a shrug. Not to be recommended

We dined here with friends on a Friday night. We were four adults. I had read reviews on this site and had also had a look at their menu online. The menu looks very impressive however there are discrepancies in price. We ordered the mixed grilled platter that comes with four types of kebabs and rice and veg. So we decided to order two of these to share between four people. Firstly everything was put on one platter and the quantities did not look anywhere near to 8 kebabs. The rice was a standard sized bowl and did not look like the quantity in the picture on the menu list and there was hardly any grilled veg worth mentioning. This looked nothing like the picture on the menu list. The price was also different to the online menu. The online menu stated the mixed grilled platter at $29 whilst the menu at the restaurant stated $39! We paid $80 for a platter that could not be justified by the contents of that platter. We asked for some pita bread and were given 2 pieces for four adults who had paid $80 for two platters. We paid $50 per pax and still went home hungry! Beware if you order the grilled platter as you definitely do not get your moneys worth. We ordered cocktails at $14 each and could not taste any alcohol in it. I have eaten at other middle eastern restaurants however Beirut is nothing special and too expensive considering there are others that give you similar tastes and flavours. Dont waste your money here

We were introduced to this restaurant by a family friend who had celebrated their birthday party at the first floor wing and since then we are regular visitors to this place. This restaurant is perhaps the only one which has Indian DJ that plays until middle of the night. Though the restaurant is a bit congested , yet the food is very tasty and almost authentic in taste compared to Middle-East cusine. The best dishes are humous , pita bread and kebabs. They have a spicy grilled chicken which is mouth watering and spicy. The housewin is not too expensive and goes well with the cusine. On Friday nights there is even abelly dancing show. Food prices are reasonable.I would recommend this restaurant as a good option in Arab street
4
The Food is good but quite expansive. Environment is nice and quiet. Nice terrace to spend the evening and have a drink...
4
Found this restaurant by accident but what a find. The place was very busy downstairs so we were shown up to the Magic Carpet Lounge. Atmosphere was fantastic and the food and service were great also.
Worth checking it out.

First the food doesn't taste like Lebanese or Middle eastern food it's got a bit of tandoori taste to it ? So not too sure what that's all about ? There wasn't a middle eastern person in sight all the staff were Indian and philopino, the service was appalling after the waitress finally saw us and took our order she brought over the mixed mezze and threw it down on the table, when changing courses I always find it strange why they don't clear the cause before first? She brought over the mixed grill expecting me to take it from her hand and then she picks up the finished starters ? I visited the wash room and walked through the passage and there was stacks and stacks if dirty plates with half eaten meals on them absolutely disgusting!After dinner we were told by the lady at the front if the restaurants that we should visit the night club upstairs the 'magic carpet' we went up this small flight of stairs and opened the door and clouds and clouds of smoke came out of this dark little room ! What? Everyone is smoking the shisha pipe thing ?? I thought smoking indoors and confined area is illegal in SG !? Someone correct me if I am wrong !!Btw I would never be this hard on restaurants normally the only reason I am writing this review is because I have a bad tummy this morning after eating there !!Sorry Beirut you need to clean up your act
4
Came here for lunch, good authentic menu and tasty food. Relaxed and informal. Particularly recommend the chicken shawarma and the mezze
5
I really like arabic food, and by far this is one of the best restaurant in SIngapore offering great middle eastern food.The mezza were really good
5
I came here after reading a review on Trip Advisor and I was not dissapointed at all! The food was just soo simply sublime and as beautiful as in the pictures. I am writing this review months and months after going to eat here and it still sticks in my mind. One of the waiters was a bit lush too. If i am ever back in Singapore i must just pop back again to have another lovely bite to eat
4
I went here with a colleague while wandering around near our hotel. The concierge had suggested a different restaurant which had only a few people in it whereas this one was quite full. Our meal was outstanding in every respect other than the service which was on the indifferent side. We had mixed pastries appetizer which was very good, spicy sausages and a mixed grill platter. All were well seasoned and delightful. I highly recommend this restaurant
5
Amazing street side food! In the heart of the Arab district of Singapore, in sight of the Mosque. The staff are attentive and professional, the food high quality and tasty. Prices are reasonable for Singapore, and if your on a budget there is a happy hour too. We tried a range of starters and they were amazing, but we didn't manage to get onto the mains
4
Whilst visiting friends in Singapore we left all meal decisions to their local knowledge and this was one of the best.We would never have considered a Lebanese restaurant on our own being a little dyed in the wool when it comes to food and generally sticking to what we know but after this experience we will definitely not ignore a Lebanese restaurant again.The restaurant looks nothing special from the outside, just another back street eatery, one of the hundreds in Singapore. As we walked in we were greeted by a friendly owner/manager and quickly seated with our menus. Drinks orders were taken and very quickly arrived. Being Lebanese food virgins we were very unsure what to choose so left that to our ‘expert’ friends. They chose a couple of different combination starters to share which we all quickly polished off, even my normally ‘picky’ wife. These consisted mainly of various snack sized meats and kebabs. Main courses were very much rice based but each with its own unique flavours. The rice dishes were accompanied again with various meat and fish dishes. Everything was flavoursome without being particularly hot (in a spicy way) which suited my wife. Portion sizes were only just adequate and we could have probably managed another couple of main dishes without feeling uncomfortable. Service continued as it started being friendly, prompt and efficient throughout and regularly checking if more drinks were required.Prices in this area of Singapore all tended to be much of a muchness and the Beirut Grill was no different.Overall this was a very pleasant surprise with very tasty food and we can definitely recommend the restaurant
5
Beirut Restaurant better known as magic carpet is one of my favourite hang outs! Great staff who are friendly and very accommodating! Been there countless times with friends and family! It is a great place to have a chilled quiet night with friends or for a good night of dancing and fun! Their food is amazing and reasonable. I also love their long island tea there which is my favourite! I go to many places and must always try the long island, this by far is the best i have tried:) Gary, one of their main staff is always full of energy and always ready to make sure everyone who visits Magic carpet has the best experience! Great place all in all
5
Magic carpet is one of my fav to go places in Singapore! It has amazing sheeshas and has great service!
In the food I would highly recommend the chicken Shish tawook and the mezze platter! Both r my personal favorites do check it out!
5
Been patronising for the past 2 yrs...or maybe more... Gr8 place to chill on any day and to let your hair down on the weekends...well might be slightly pricey...but then again, awesome plc to wine, dine and dance too!!! ;)
5
Awesome place to party, Great Music, friendly staff. Impressive ambiance. Manager Gary is friendly and accommodating! Happening Place to Be!!..
2
Not impressed, food was salty but not very tasty (weakly spiced), drinks were weak and the service rudimentary. We spent S$130 for 2. Not worth the money. Oh well, don't try don't know...
1
Absolutely not recomended. The food do not tastes like arabic cusine. They don't know how to use spices... Money for nothing...
5
Has to be the best place to have shishaah and drinks in Singapore. It's also the only place I know where you can get Paan (Menthol) flavour shishaah. And the food is great too -- even for Vegetarians! My favourite is the classic falafel wrap. The staff are super fun and friendly. Some of the other reviews here mention the food being salty, but I have never found that to be the case. Always a great time at the Beirut Grill / Magic Carpet
5
Great atmosphere. Friendly staff who are willing to go and extra mile to make sure that you have a wonderful experience. Amazing dj which plays non stop hits the whole night. There is no way you cant have a good time. You will keep coming back for more.!!!!!
1
The food served in this restaurant isn't all that great and is very ordinary. I have had better Lebanese food at half the price in the same locality. They just have two tables outside and do not serve hookah inside. It was a disappointment to have not served hookah on our visit. The location of this restaurant is dicey as well, because when we went to the restaurant, there was some fight going between restaurant management and their customers. I would refrain from going to this place. All in all not a very pleasant experience
4
It is my second time to dine at beirut grill with my family and the same experienced we felt when we first came. I personally like and appreciate the service staff who took extra time to entertain my kids and make them feel comfortable. The reason why me and my wife decided to come back to beirut and dine because first of all is their mezza platter. For me it is the best starter i had and followed by the grilled items which we ordered. The Lamb chops in particular is my favorite. Yummy! The serving was good and cooked the way I want it to be. Overall, it was a very good dining experience for me and my family! Cheers
4
Been with my friends and colleagues in this place called Beirut Grill, the ambiance was quite good, but what captured us was to try their Lebanese dishes as this is quite popular back in my country. I've no regret dining on this place as the food was really great. The mezza is closed to perfection, real Lebanese food. The meat was a classy taste. By the way, the Manager and staff are friendly. I will definitely come back and introduce to my friends. Money worth it. A must - try, something like a Middle Eastern in a cozy place along Arab Street! I should snatch the chef to cook for me and friends at home
4
Had hummus and the mixed grill platter - more than I could eat, but still persuaded myself to have some baklava. Rolled away thinking I'd come back some day. Only disappointment was the lack of Turkish coffee. Not cheap though.
4
On short notice, I was able to make a reservation for 13 people. They accommodated us, with great service and great food. I will be back again, to try some more of the delicious entrees.
2
We are on way back home from Beirut and indeed most dissapointing experience ever !! We are vegetarians and were elated to see so much vegetarian options ...Everything we ordered had only one thing in common .... EXcessive salt !!! We ordered hummus which was just ok , deep fried cheese something which was tooo salty and falafel which was salty too !! We ordered lemon freeze for drink believe me or not even that was not upto the mark ... Indeed a very bad Friday dinner .overall service was ok and ambience average but what is all this if food in a restaurant itself is not good.. To describe the experience in a word I would say SALTY !!!
3
tried beirut grill as we wanted a change from Alaturka our regular haunt and had heard they had a decent sheesha. the dips (especially labneh) were top notch, falafel well textured if over salted but the meats were distinctly average...however the 2002 chateau musar (at $110) made up for most of that. service can be hit and miss depending on restaurant traffic but then again i'm used to asking for everything twice when in singapore. you could do far worse in that area for arabic food (cafe le caire, gulf beach etc) and worth a shot if you need a midweek hummus fix
2
Our experience at Beirut Grill is so consistent with the few most recent reviews that it is uncanny (unfortunately, we hadn't checked before going there for lunch). My wife and I shared the mezze platter which was pretty nice. Well presented with good bread. The falafel though were very salty. For main course we shared the mixed grill and a fatoush salad. This is when things fell apart. The meat was really poor quality. Dry, chewy and lacking in flavour. The single lamb chop looked like an afterthought. The salad was equally poor. Fatoush should be fragrant with fresh herbs and chillies flavoured with lemon juice and olive oil. Not so here. This was a mixed salad with a hind of herbs.Singapore is bereft of good middle eastern fare. Our hunt continues
3
I've been to Beirut several times because it happens to be near my office at The Concourse and there are few non-Asian restaurants within walking distance. My visit yesterday was better than sometimes in the past, where I've concluded that I perhaps didn't order sensibly. However, everything doesn't quite come together in the right way. The food is OK. The service is OK. The ambience is OK. But the overall package doesn't make one rush back. The big advantage that this place does have is that it is never busy so it's never too noisy to have a good conversation with one's lunch companion
2
We've been 4+ times before to Beirut and always had decent service and good food. Last time the meat we ordered was dry and without flavour however I thought I'd give it another try! The lamb chops I was served were so dry that on cutting into one, I decided to send it back. They are advertised as "the best in Singapore" and they were probably the worst I've ever been served!!The dips and pitta are always good (hummus, foul madames, tabbouleh) and didnt disappoint. If you go here, stick to the mezze style dips and good value wine rather than going for the cremated meat!

We were at Bussorah Street during the Ramadan period and were thinking of mid-eastern fare. Based on Tripadvisor's reviews, our choices were narrowed down to 3 restaurants (Amirah's, Beirut and Zac's). Since we had dined at Amirah on a previous Ramadan (and enjoyed the meal very much), we decided to try one of the other 2. Zac's dinner buffet (at S$30++) was very popular and had a very good spread of food. We would have dined there if not for the fact they only had outdoor seating left (at around 8pm) and we thought that it was too warm a night to sit outside. So we decided on trying Beirut instead. Unlike Zac's, Beirut was only 1/2 full (at 8 pm during Ramadan). We settled on sharing a Hummus ($8) and the Chef's recommended "Lamb Kofta" and "Beef Tikka" ($20 each). The Hummus was good but then again, how difficult is it to make Hummus? Unfortunately, the mains were very disappointing primarily because the meat was very dry. It felt as if it was cooked or left there for an hour before we ordered them and by the time we were served, the juices in it had all but evaporated. I don't often have this experience but I was thinking of what I could have had at Zac's while dining at Beirut! Service was minimal. Why? We sat there with empty water glasses for at least 10 minutes, while our plates were cleared. The waitresses came, saw and walked away without refilling our glasses. How expensive or troublesome can plain water be? After 10 minutes, I decided not to bother with dessert or coffee and asked for the bill. That rather unsatisfying experience costs over S$60 for the 3 items and a mocktail. As I write this, I am making plans to dine at Zac's or one of the other mid-eastern outlets at Kampong Glam over the coming weekend

I've never come across a management this unprofessional before. My sister asked a waitress to change our charcoal. This waitress immediately stated that there was no more charcoal and walked away. No apologies, no customer service. My sister asked another waiter for charcoal and he changed it immediately. When my sister questioned the girl, she said that they had to MAKE charcoal for us. Amazing how i paid for my sheesha but had to be grateful to them for "MAKING" charcoal for us. When my sister called her out on her blunder, the waitress stalked away and the manager came to talk to my sister. He was disgusting and started shouting at my sister asking her to not touch him. (Yeah, he was offended that my sister supposedly touched him). Afterwhich, the manager walked away. At this point, a bouncer came up to me and asked me to get out of the vicinity. When i asked him why (I was unaware of the situation and my sister was too confused to even explain to me), the bouncer said he got orders from the manager to kick us out but he is unsure of what the reason was. ...what does that even mean? It's funny how we paid the $500 bill and had not even finished our drinks at that point but we were made to leave w/o any explanations. We did not raise our voices, hurl vulgarities, start a brawl etc. My grp consisted of only 3 girls, and 2 of us were not aware of what was going on. I asked the manager to come down so we can talk. When I asked him why he kicked us out, he said "because i'm the boss". What an ridiculous excuse. The bouncer wanted to physically drag me out while i was still talking to the manager before my friend stopped him. The only reason the manager gave for kicking us out was that I was "threatening". That was even more confusing considering the fact that I was not even involved in this argument until AFTER they kicked us out. Plus the fact that i'm 5ft tall and nobody has ever said i was threatening before. ALL THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE WE ASKED FOR CHARCOAL.I will never recomment this place to anyone especially not a small group of young girls. I can't help but think that if there were guys with us, the manager would have ill-treated us like that.Although i've been to magic carpet several times before, i've always been there in big groups and never had any problems. The Magic Carpet management gets their highs from intimidating girls who come alone

I'd been through Singapore a few times before without having been to the Arab Quarter - it turned out to be one of my favourite districts in Singapore with plenty going on.We ate here and the decor is stylish and the food is good. Dips were great and main of New Zealand lamb in spices was tasty.Would definitely recommend if anyone wants a break from regular Singaporean/Asian food

Very efficient service and friendly service. The food was relatively good with larger than average portion.

We arrived here after traveling through Vietnam and Laos for 6 weeks. Looking at the menu I was immediately drawn to the "New Zealand rib eye steak with mushroom sauce", my wife selected chicken wings. We requested they be served together, with a home made pita bread as a starter. Happy hour was on and we ordered a jug of beer and eventually two glasses, (pints, allegedly) turned up. SGD10 each, quite rich after beer prices in VN and Laos. My wifes wings were served, alone, and after 5 minutes waiting I inquired about the bread and my meal- bread then came followed a few minutes later by my steak, more like an overdone minute steak than a medium rare rib eye that was ordered - the accompanying sauce was shy of mushrooms, powdery and dry. I sent the meal back as I would not eat it - I shoud have been wiser, looking at the price and really expecting rib eye from NZ for $25. My wifes wings were very overpowering in lemon flavour. All up, not worthwhile, also very noisy; pleasant staff but I hope there is better to find.Gre

We went to Beirut Grill for a late lunch/early afternoon meal. When we arrived, there were two other customers seated outside and a group of tourists inside. We chose to take our meal inside since it was hot outside and inside had an a/c. Food ordered were the following:1. Chicken Shawarma - best chicken shawarma my friends had by far. lots of chicken meat, very tasty sauce that blended well, crisp pita. was accompanied by fries that "melts in your mouth" accdg to my friend2. Fried cheese - forgot the name. it was very salty but good so i had it with pita and cucumber yogurt salad3. Pita bread - baked fresh, not just heated. 4. Cucumber yougurt - went well with the friied cheese as it "tamed" the saltiness. would've been great if there were more cucumber though.Would probably come back for the dessert, coffee and cocktails next time. The servers were helfpul and friendly, explaining the menu items and were prompt with their service

I have been to this place on several occasions now and they never fail to impress. There hasn't been one instance where the food was bad or the service poor. I generally order the Mezze platter and the seafood platter and they are great. The shisha is well made and if you are still hungry give their desserts a go. The Lounge upstairs called the Magic Carpet is also a great place to shake a leg after dinner. They play good music!! Overall I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for good Arabic food

Visited this jount on 12th April 2013 along with my family. Ordered Shisha. Wait time, 20 minutes along with 3 reminders for 2 front liners. Repeat order of a beer mug. Wait time, 17 minutes after a second reminder. When I question the waiter about the delay in order delivery I am told "we are busy today". Frankly, that should not be the way to answer your paymaster. By the way, I was the guy who settled my SD83 bill not with my credit card but with a SD1000 note to show my anger and frustration. Thank you for returning my change correctly. Of course not a cent of tip was left behind as I cleaned every dollar and cent out.Will I be back here again? No! I guess I will be too busy in future for this crap outlet.My contact, 97655599. I am, Dr Ken

Beirut is a ground floor shophouse restaurant in the arab street area. Everything is about it is good, not great. We started with a mixed mezze ($22) which consisted of hummus (not bad, but overtahini'd), Babaganouj (excellent), something resembling babaganouj with peppers and tomato in it (also good), a couple of disappointing falaffels and something resembling a Lebanese spring roll, accompanied with two hot, fresh pita breads. Main course was the mixed grill ($29) which was chicken, beef, lamb chop, and minced lamb, all marinated in various spices and grilled. The meat was succulent, the spice mixes excellent, although it was let down by being served with what appeared to be bottled thousand island dressing. Carlsberg is $12 a pint at happy hour prices before 9 (although $12 a pint doesn't seem particularly happy), and the hot apple tea tasted like neither apples nor tea and was a very disappointing end. Ambiance, like the food, is acceptable without being spectacular, although there was one six person table at the back with one of those harem-tent things. There should be a warning sign on the bathroom for tall people. I smacked my head once. There is an outdoor area with shisha for those who like to kill themselves slowly while dining

We have eaten several times at this restaurant, both lunch and dinner. Their mezza platters are great, as are their main course meat platters. We arrived with family on a public holiday for dinner at 8.00pm. The restaurant was busy, but we were offered an inside table for an hour, after which it was booked. Ordering was swift and courteous. The food arrived quickly and was fine. A belly dancer then appeared and wandered around to loud music, trying to get female customers to join in. Several had a go. Not the best middle eastern food, but perfectly adequate
4
We visited on a Sunday night, initially sitting inside, but on feeling the icy air conditioning blast moved to an outdoor table with a fan. Food was delicious. The staff knew the ingredients of everything and were easily able to advise for those with dietary requirements. The seafood platters went down really well, and chicken delicious. The wine is expensive (as in all Singapore) but their wine list was extensive and well chosen. Would visit again when in Singapore

What a shame. After having such good Lebanese food in Malaysia we were craving it again. Ordered a Fattoush and 2 Mixed Grills. Was $75 Singapore, sooooo over priced. Now onto the food. Fattoush had a hair in it which no joke would have been about 30-40cm long. Kafta had been reheated in a microwave.Same with the Lamb Cutlet. Would not recommend.
3
Have been back here now a few times. Why? Not because you know the service will always be friendly. Some of the staff is OK, most of them are not. And not because all the food is great. Some of it is OK, some is pretty bad.BUT: some of the food is VERY GOOD if you know what to order. The char-grilled meat is good and so are some of the meze. Like anywhere else at Arab St, the price is too high. But from the couple of restaurants I've tried around here, I like the food at Beirut most

We booked a corner for 12 in the upstairs in the "Magic Carpet" part for a 7pm birthday dinner, and ended up staying until 3am. The food was excellent (fantastic value as well) - the lamb kofta and dip plates are a must try and as I remember totaled less than $25SG. Great sheesha blends and the service was very genuine. After dinner the music came on and atmosphere changed into a more late night bar, complete with DJ, dance floor and smoke machine! Was SO much fun! Definitely recommend a stop over - be sure to stay past 11pm for the party time

I took my 70-year old Egyptian mother (who has difficulty walking) to Arab street to get a bite at lunch yesterday. We showed up at 11:50am for lunch, not understanding that the restaurant didn't open until noon. Instead of politely explaining, having us sit down at one of their outdoor tables, or offering even a glass of water, the rude staffer made us wait in the hot sun even five minutes after the supposed time of opening. Forget it. There are plenty of great places to eat with even better customer service than to waste your time or money eating at Beirut. Walk just a block up to Derwish Turkish Restaurant which offers good food, a better view, nicer atmosphere and polite and friendly owner

We were turned away because the restaurant was "fully booked," yet there was only one table taken in the entire restaurant. I wasn't sure if the couple we were meeting had made a reservation, so I saw the entire reservation book, and the earliest reservation wasn't for another hour. It was quite obvious that we were turned away simply because we had two children with us (ages 6 and 8). They were calm and quiet, not misbehaving. We could have easily and eaten and left in an hour. So, if you have children, you should probably skip this restaurant

Been here four times in the past three months - three times for dinner and once for lunch. I like the atmosphere plus the food is consistent. I have had Lebanese food in some Middle Eastern countries and this is as authentic as i know it to be. I especially like their platters and the kofta kebab. Service is inconsistent - there's one Filipina who is excellent but another who is sometimes quite sour-faced. I would keep going back and if the grumpy Filipna is still there, I will ask to be served by the lovely one :-

We have been regulars here since last few months, just love the food and ambiance of this place.The crowd is amazing upstairs in their small dance club and lounge. Awesome selection of food and drinks in the restaurant below. They make amazing Sheesha and service is top class.Always head here for a fantastic evening

we really enjoyed the evening there even though it was quite loud - Lions we playing :) food was good and staff was friendly. we'll definitely come back and recommend. only 1 point - hopefully they will serve pita bread and not just charge for it :)
3
We chose its signature dish, grilled lamb, and were disappointed, especially for the price. Maybe, we were disappointed because we ate the previous night at The Curry Culture and had the best grilled lamb we have ever experienced.However, the service was good, and bread and humus were outstanding
3
The menu contains Lebanese food but you need to know what to order: there are also spaghetti bolognese and tandoori chicken. I really don't know what makes them lebanese. Anyways, tabullah and hummus were good, halloumi cheese too salty. For the main courses the kebab was very tasty. A nice surprise was that they had Chateau Musar 2002 in their wine list. That happens to be one of my favorite wines
2
We went to the Beirut restaurant after reading the good reviews on tripadvisor. We had a disappointed experience. We had the Mezze platter and grilled Haloumi cheese. Every item was mediocre especially the haloumi cheese which was barely edible. The service was slow even though the place was almost empty. We will not return
5
Loved it! Quality food with generous servings. A big selection of wine (and wine was expensive as with everywhere in Singapore), but everything else was great. It's located just at the end of the street toward beach road, and a little away from the nagging vendors. We sat inside to get some relief from the humidity, and could see the chef preparing our meal through a little glass window. Atmosphere made for a great evening

great and authentic arabian food, familial atmosphere, good service,
interesting menue, even people which do not know arabian food will
find some dishes.

Great atmosphere and wonderful belly dancer on weekends. She totally steals the show!
4
Likes: the warm Lebanese unleavened bread was wonderful. The hummus was different than normal and very delicious. The drinks were tasty.
Dislikes: the prices were a bit high. The chicken dish (their specialty) was not very good as the meat was very dry.
5
Nice place. Its busy but the service is fast and the food was great.

I am generally not a fan of middle eastern food, but this place has changed my mind. Lovely looking place with friendly staff and wonderful food. We started with a mez platter and for main spring chicken and spicy calamari. Generous servings, so no room for desert

Lebanese in Singapore? 72 Bussorah Street. That is all. ..So I wished I could just end right there and then, but this would be a total unjustifiable comment/ critique/ what-have-you/s (!) Beirut Grill is a neat two-storey Middle Eastern restaurant tucked away from the bustling main roads of Arab street. Opened only in the recent December of 2010 (yes its a pretty young restaurant really), Beirut is nothing short of gastronomical experiences of the Lebanese cuisine. Period. For the uninitiated, need an Education on Mediterranean cuisine but clueless? Head here. The lovely restaurant's manager and staff will be more than delighted to help you out with your choices. And if you're in luck, you might be able to chance upon their spectacular event nights, gorgeous belly-dancers await, along with the lovely crowd of patrons this magnificent hideout draws. And since I do head there/ wish to be there frequent, you might see me here - so do say your his, and share your tales.  As it is, I only speak nothing but the truth, check out Beirut. Regards

Whenever I craved for middle eastern cusine, I will head for Beirut Grill. The food is good and price reasonable. I love the hermus and the lamp chop best. The restaurant's ambience is great too. The service crew always friendly and warm. I recommend you visit Beirut Grill for lunch or dinner with family, friends or even a romantic dinner with your love one.

A great place to relax after work and soak up a good atmosphere or start your weekend. i've tried quite a few of the dishes and i enjoyed all of of them and i'm now quite a regular. It's in a nice part of town and it feels out of the hustle and bustle of central Singapore. A highly recommended bar/restaurant

Located in the Arab corner of Singapore, it brings out Lebanese food like no other. Perfectly matched is the atmosphere to relax and enjoy dining good food. Indeed the pricing is mid-range, I believe it matches what the food has to offer and the quick customer service. If you're new to Lebanese food, do trust the recommendations of the service staff. Most of the time, they are pretty spot on. After dining at Beirut, my suggestion is not to neglect that they have on an upper level where you can grab some beers and party away to dj sets of the night. I would say in short if you're looking for a place to dine Lebanese food and thinking of partying right after, give this restaurant a shot. I'm sure you won't be disappointed

Christmas eve 2011 and thought i would have some good Lebanese food. Read reviews on TA. It was a total let down! A small restaurant with possibily 25 covers within the restaurant and out on the sidewalk.There were just 3 other tables occupied at 9.30pm. The menu is limited- not much choice.The Hummus was decent. Had a mixed grilled platter. Kebabs were dry, the pita bread was far from pita bread. There was a belly dancer that appeared and performed for five minutes. The place i consider expensive for the food they serve. I would avoid this place
