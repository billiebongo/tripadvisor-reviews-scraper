The servers at Latitude Bistro need much improvement. Servers are impolite and not attentive. Manner are rude. The food are average. Restaurant look rather empty.

Order seafood ho fun and burger. Food ordinary. Nothing outstanding. Few customers in he restaurant . Servers need much improvement. Unwilling to serve and disinterested. Not very polite. The services have deteriorated over the years.

I was back from boating n plan to have a swim n enjoy the jacuzzi in the pool. As a pool lover, I choose to dine beside the pool than going to the bistro for dinner. I'm glad that they offer pool sitting right here.

nice place for breakfast. service a bit slow.
Menu is a bit limited. could really do well with the right training of staff.

Had 2 meals at the restaurants; Dinner and Breakfast. Very different experiences as the service was attentive and great during dinner. But the breakfast was completely opposite. The morning team seemed a bit understaffed and the service was not as prompt. The cleanliness of the dishes and bowls during breakfast was below expectation. Stains and dirt could found on the supposedly clean dishes and bowls at the breakfast buffet table.

We ordered a semi buffet dinner, which comes with a main course and free access to the salad and dessert bar. For the salad bar, other than just simple salad only, it also comes with a selection of seafood, soup, bread, cheese etc. The dessert bar has a good selection of cakes, patteries and ice-cream. The price ranging from $32 to 45++ depending on the main course ordered. Very reasonable for a nice place and food quality. We all ordered different main course and the portion is definitely sufficient. All very nicely presented. Ala carte menu is also available if you want to keep it simple. The place is opened to public on Mons to Thurs. Nice place to chill out with friends if you don't mind driving all the way in to Sentosa Cove. Is always nice to dine with a good sea view. I will definitely visit the place again

Went there for breakfast.Breakfast spread - limited. But I did enjoy their pastries and they have a lovely waffle & egg station.I think the only service provided was by Royston, who was friendly, attentive and went out of his way to explain things to us. He is the only reason I am giving this restaurant 4 stars. The other staff looked like they should be the ones having breakfast. They need the energy

Both the food and the service at this place is above average and fully worth for the member price offered. However what make the place 'special' is the view of the Marina.From what I know, you need to be a member/ be with one to dine here

We stayed at the ONE 15 Club Marina in Singapore and ate regularly in the Latitude Bistro. We had 6 little children with us and the bistro was kid friendly. It was set up more for adults to eat but we didn't feel uncomfortable with all the kids - we did try and eat early. Prices were reasonable compared to other food place around the Marina

I've been a member of the marina for about eight years, but normally just use the bistro on weekends. However, last week I stopped by for lunch on a weekday and was pleasantly surprised to see the place nearly full - and to find out that they have a weekday special that includes a choice of entrees PLUS the full buffet for $19. It's also nice to see the place nearly full! Helpful hint - the local dishes are generally superb. The western dishes are not. Stick to the local dishes to whatever degree possible

The friendly staffs and location. A place to get away for relaxation. Not rowdy and crowded. Affordable price tag for their drinks menu.

I enjoyed this little restaurant.. The appetizers were small but filling and I ordered the steak. It was prepared perfectly but slightly grissly. I would return here on my next visit to sinagapore but probably opt out of the steak option.

The food is nice almost comparable with hotel standard and the price is reasonable . Restaurant just had a renovation . Very nice ,peaceful ambiance great place to chill out with friends,

I was lucky enough to stay in the clubrooms at Marina One Fifteen, therefore was delighted to experience the excellent breakfast and evening meal in Latitude Bistro, in particular the full Breakfast was top notch after a few days boating around this beautiful part of Singapor

Wanted to go to One Degree 15 Sentosa Cove to see how the well to do people live, awesome. Harbour was filled with exclusive luxury yachts, Great looking Condo's looking onto the harbour, what a life. Then i woke up enjoyed the meal, had a great NZ Sauvignon blanc and headed back to the Hotel very satisfied

Went there for the italian dinner buffet on 2nd may 2015 to celebrate my little one's birthday. Made a reservation for 8 but a table for 6 was prepared. Shifted 3 times moving my little one here and there. Ordered pasta for my little one. First time it came, it was cold. Feedback it was cold. Second time it came, still COLD.So ironic that the restaurant served cold pasta during italian buffet. Third time it was not cold but not as well cooked as the usual pasta. The buffet food has insufficient variety. Italian buffet has no pizza and cold pasta.Staff was unfriendly, not smiling and not helpful. Extremely poor service. Would not go back there again. Recommend not to go there, unless you want cold pasta and untasteful service

The good thing about this restaurant is that it is not as expensive as the other quayside isle restaurants which tend to be super overpriced. The service here is acceptable, and the food is alright. Nothing spectacular, and nothing bad either. The view is quite good, should you choose to sit outside. Don't expect fine dining level of food here, but its definitely better than your average swensons/chain restaurant.The best thing on the menu is hands down the seafood hor fun. The pizzas are also not bad, and great for sharing.The ambience is very nice and chill so overall, this is a nice place to go to for a relaxed lunch/dinner
4
A good selection of food ranging from Local, Western and Indian dishes. Try the seafood horfun, seafood marina, pizza and briyani. Durian pengat is really good if you like durian.This place also serves buffet for lunch and dinner.The view of the Marina is scenic especially in the evening time.

I liked the way they had a semi-buffet style dinner. There were main entrees to choose from and the appetizers, sides and desserts were part of the buffet. The appetizers were delicious as well as the desserts - my favorite was the CrÃ¨me Brule in various flavors
