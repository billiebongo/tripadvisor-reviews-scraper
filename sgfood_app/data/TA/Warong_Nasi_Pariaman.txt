Nasi Padang Place in Singapore. It’s popular amongst the Malays here too, which says a lot for their food and friendly service. It’s not too spicy, with their speciality of mutton rendang and bbq chicken.

I come here every time i have craving for good Nasi Padang. Sometimes, after my meal, i order a few more Ayam Bakars to go and share them with family or friends. Yes, it is that good. Other very good dishes are the Sotong and Beef Rendan
5
This is not my first time trying this restaurant’s food and I can safely say it serves excellent Padang cuisine. It’s also good value for money. The “ayam bakar” is a must try as well as the squid. I’m pretty sure everything else tastes great too

While walking through the Arab Street area we noticed a small open Indonesian restaurant and stopped in for lunch.The lady incharge happily explained what the food options contained and I selected some chilli squid and rice (which was truly excellent) and my wife selected a curry with a side dish. A selection of other dishes and side-dishes were available with pictures on the wall to make it easier. The total cost of our meals (without drinks) was only $13, and will make sure I eat there again next time we are in Singapore.In looking at the history and pictures on the wall, it seems that this restaurant has been there for several generations, and they are very proud of their restaurant - rightfully so.Definitely worth a visit

I often come to this restaurant for my fix of Padang food. The cooks have yet to let me down and what I truly appreciate is the consistency and authenticity of the food. It provides good value for money and meals here are highly satisfactory. Two thumbs up

had lunch there for a really reasonable price. Beef Rendang and chicken curry was excellent. we had a large choice of side dish which were maybe less outstanding (bland tofu, tempeh could have been spicier\tastier, same for the sambal ).still overall a very good lunch

It's more economical to share dishes here than buying individually. The most popular dish here is their ayam bakar (bbq chicken) with coconut milk gravy but i personally prefer the sotong gulai (squids cooked in curry). Other dishes to try are the beef rendang, bagedel (deep-fried mashed potato mixed with minced beef and coriander and coated with egg), and sambal goreng (a mixture of long beans, soy patties and fried beancurd).
5
It's worth waiting for a table if you can't get straight in, the food is excellent and is a favorite of my local friends. It's a long established restaurant that has been family run for many years and great value. It's on the edge of china town so a walk round the historic sights nearby is a great way to use up some of the calories

In Singapore there are only few best Nasi Padangs and Nasi Pariaman ranked one of the best. This place serves authentic malay padang which is great. The rendang is by far the best i have tried in Singapore.

Having Lunch in this Restaurant and we ordered Rendang, Chicken, Grilled Fish, Potato, and some vegetables. The taste was awesome and yummy. They served the fresh food and it was enjoyable. This restaurant is good and fully recommended. We will come again to have another authentic local menu

I've been eating this for years and it's sad for me to say that the quality has dropped. Went there on an evening, in hope to recommend it to my Boyfriend for its top notch nasi campur, turns out there was so limited of choices and I've felt that the food was beginning to turn bad already. Even so, the price was pricey for just that small portion. Will try and bring him in the afternoon with a wider variety option.

An established eatery serving Nasi Padang in the Kampong Glam area since the early 50s. It's just two doors away from my birthplace, the former Kampong Glam general post office and is nostalgic for me whenever I dined at this stall. You need to drop in early for lunch (11 - 11:30 am) as this is one of the popular lunch spot and it gets very crowded and food are sold out in very short time! There are no dishes served that I disliked at all as Indonesian Padang food is one of my favorite comfort meals...I described the dishes as "SHIOK and SEDAP!"

Wandered in off the street while I was looking around Haji lane. As the only foreigner in the cafe, it could have been a bit daunting since I had no idea what any of the dishes were but the owner?/manager? came out from behind the counter and recommended I try the very popular bbq chicken in tangy coconut curry and also some mixed vegetables. Very quickly served and can highly recommend!!! The chicken was very tender and I am not a curry person but this curry was delicious! It was tangy and light and one of my favourite dishes I had in Singapore! The wait staff all came by to see what I thought of it and seemed genuinely interested in how I liked the cuisine. Overall an extremely good experience and very authentic Muslim food

Attracted by the clean modern Asian interior and the variety of dishes on the menu I gave it a Chance. Nicely busy I was served quickly. The Food arrived quickly, very tender Beef, everything nicely spiced. The freshly prepared fruit Juices matched nicely. Give it a go when you are in the are

Have had the food from this establishment since I could hold a spoon. My grandparents lived next door to the original owners before World War 2 so my dad grew up with the dishes. He would faithfully order take out even in the 80s, 90s and till today (he's in his 80s). The taste has NOT changed. The food is as good as it was when I remembered it as a child. We eat this at least once every 6 months. Mostly takeout but sometimes dine-in.Stand out dishes that are must-haves:Ayam bakar korma (chargrilled chicken with a coconut and spiced sauce) - so good that you can taste the aroma of the charcoal fire with each morsel. Order dark meat to get the full effects.Beef Rendang (slow cooked beef in spices) - tender, flavourful and worth cardiac arrest. Nangka curry (tropical fruit and sees made into a delectable curry) - a south east asian dish that you shouldn't miss. Getting harder to find these days. A good vegetarian option.Honorable mentions: Grilled Fish with soy sauce, chili and onion.Achar - simple cucumber pickle, nice and crunchy.Grilled squid/calamari - also comes in a curry. The food here is so good that it is rumoured that the former Sultan of Johor would send his driver to bunkus (packet/take out) from this establishment. It has now become somewhat pricey, but then again, Singapore in 2016 isn't cheap anywhere. Expect to pay about $10-15 per head depending on what you order.Highly recommended and if you're visiting Singapore, a must experience meal. Suggest you aim to arrive by 1115am and dine before the crowd rolls in. Arrival after 1245 might mean missing out on some dishes

This place serves top notch nasi campur. Caveat, on weekdays your choices of dishes narrow down after lunch time as this place is packed to the brim during lunch hours. So try to be there early to have a full selection of the delicious dishes! Try the rendang and bagedil as it's not to be missed!

I came here for big breakfast this morning and ordered fish, chicken and some vegies. The taste is delicious, same like almost 20 years ago. Only the place has been renovated, brighter and cleaner. Don't come here on Friday afternoon unless you want to join a very long queue

We visited this little restaurant on the day we landed in Singapore for a quick lunch . It was an extremely delicious meal !! So authentic and full of flavor !! Would definitely reccomend this restaurant . It isn't a fancy one but the food is better than many well known restaurants !!

They have great Nasi Padang - local Malay food. You must come early or else you will be disappointed as food will finish by lunch time. Most of time I will book in advance. The prices are reasonable. I am sure to return.

Great Nasi Padang (Rice) dishes. Plenty to choose from. They have expanded in terms of size and extended the operating hours as well. They even serve satay at night!

Food is always excellent but unfortunately the place is too small and doesn't do it justice. I've been here many times and can always rely on the quality of the food.

A nasi padang restaurant that seems popular with the locals with few tourists. Be warned that service was totally confusing since the wait staff does not really wait but brings the menu, delivers food and clears the tables. Ordering is by joining a long line inside the restaurant and you must have an idea of what to order. I'm also not sure if the staff is so unable to understand English, given that this is Singapore. Anyway, just be adventurous and try a little bit of this and that. Be careful to note that this is the normal way of eating nasi padang, that is, there are lots of small dishes, so don't get carried away. My son and I spent S$30 for lunch. Being a Muslim establishment, there is no alcohol

Found this self proclaimed "Indonesian warung" and decided to give it a try. Food was great but watch out they're tricky.As per a normal Indonesian warung we picked a selection of items to eat thinking we'd be served a small portion of each on the one plate with rice...What came out were multiple dishes of large portions. They also didn't seem to know the difference between plain black tea and tea Tarik. Despite pointing at another customer who had what we wanted.Look, the food was delicious. But I believe the "confusion" over the food portions and serving style was a deliberate ploy to fool tourists into paying more. Every other customer got the single plate meal that we thought we were ordering. Tricky...Asked for an explanation they said we had to specify "mixed style". If that's truly the case, 1) why didn't they warn us when we gave them a big order for only two people, and 2) don't proclaim yourself as an "Indonesian warung" if you don't serve your food in the Indonesian way

Came here after lunch hours to avoid the crowds. Unfortunately some of the dishes were sold out by the time we got there. No matter, the food we ordered was great! Had the rendang, kuah lemak, sambal goreng and grilled chicken! Did not disappoint at all. I've tried a couple of Nasi padang stalls, definitely one of the top three out there in singapore.

We visited this pace for lunch on 10 Jan. Pretty disappointing after all the hype I've read about this place. We were there at 1pm & it was crowded. You need to secure a table first, take note of table number & go to order your food. Good variety of dishes. Service level is acceptable.Now the food was not great.Some of the dishes we had tasted was bland & we realized everything had coconut(lemak) in the gravy. No green chilli sambal & don't bother about the red chilli sambal. We had 2 chicken dishes, bagadel, 1 mutton dish, eggs, achar , tahu & beans veg & 2 bottle water.Total price =$301 pc mutton cost $3.50! Probably the most expensive mutton for a nasi padang shop! I will definitely not do a 2nd visit. Over hyped!

Guess they need more time to settle in as the lamb rendang was burnt and the food was not nice. Every dish except the omelette was nice. Quite disappointing and service was bad, took a long time for drinks to arrive, give them more time, hope food and service will improv

One of my all-time favourite spots for nasi padang, and really, the snaking lunchtime queue speaks volumes of its popularity. Although the variety of dishes is limited, indonesian/ malay dishes are quite delicate to prepare, the food definitely is a must-try when in Singapore. If you can't take spice and prefer your nasi padang very mild, Pariaman is a safe choice then. Their food is a lot milder than other Indo/ Malay eateries. This place is really quite dirt-cheap. An entire meal consisting 6 dishes for 3 persons cost barely $27. One tip though: try to hit the eatery early, before the lunch crowd, because they sell out real fast.ENJOY!!

I have been patronising this stall for many years and its always the place for me to get my nasi padang fix.I had a craving recently and got my colleague interested, so we headed down for a meal.We ordered the following items: - Beef Rendang: This came 5 minutes after the rest of our food arrived, as it was just cooked! Nice thick chunks of beef. The rendang sauce is really god, perfect with plain rice!- Eggplant with Sambal: Eggplant cut into chunks and fried. Its then laden with their special sambal chilli sauce. Spicy but yummy!- Sambal Goreng: A quintessential dish to have when having nasi padang. Beancurd, long beans and tempeh stir-fried together.- Toufu with Long Beans: This is similar to lontong. But done a little differently here. The gravy is whitish and watery. A simple dish that completes the meal.Also ordered a Teh Tarik for myself, which was good. My friend had an Iced Teh-O.The meal costs $16.60 for 2
