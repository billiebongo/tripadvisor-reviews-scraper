I can't comment on the other nam nam noodle bars in Singapore (there are 6). This is the place I went to twice while attenidng a congress in the Suntec city Convention center. Delicious and faaaaaaaaast! I had the dry sauteed lemongrass pork noodle with a lime drink (twice). They are extremely efficient and the food is so good. Besides that it is excellent value for your money: 10.20 singaporese dollars for the noodles which is a complete lunch
