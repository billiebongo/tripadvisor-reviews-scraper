Helpful & friendly service team. Food ok, nothing to write home about. Fresh enough but still lack something.

Had Ichiban Boshi for lunch at Suntec for a business lunch. Ordered Ten Don, Wagyu Steak and plenty of sushi. Food was fresh and tasty. Service was a little slow. Price is reasonable. Definitely coming back for more.

I've been here a few times for lunch and have always been satisfied with the quality of the food. Their sushi is particularly tasty.

service was great as usual, although asking for the bill took a little longer than usual. Food was yummy and affordable. They could have more drinks and dessert choices in the menu though....

This place has amazing friendly service and the price you pay is certainly value for money for the quality of shashimi you are getting.

We love going to this restaurant because Food is amazing
Service, thanks to Man Ping, is excellent.
Always good times there!

Pretty disappointed that we couldn't sit by the sushi train in spite of there being tables around - the waiter clearly doesn't believe in first come first serve. It took over 20 mins to get our edamame beans and over 45 minutes to get simple sushi plates.While the food was good, the wait time and being told where to sit was disappointing

This brand name is popular because of the affordable prices and variety offered. The sushi and sashimi are just average compared to sushi tei's. The bento and combo sets are what is unique and value for money. Though sometimes the food may not be well done and taste consistently.

At the Marina Bay Link site, there is a great selection and particularly clever offering of a special from 3:30-5:30pm for S$5.90 which provides delicious miso soup, chawamushi egg custard, pickles and then either tempura tendon, Kara-age, pork or beef selection. It got us hooked. (Trip Advisor -- Please add the Marina Bay Link site!

Ischiban Boshi at Esplanade Mall is quite small compare to other restaurant of this chain. The quality is always good.

when going for lunch with the people from the company, we chose this place and got good service and good quality food at reasonable price

Went there with family and friends as we stayed in the nearby Conrad Hotel. To be polite it is very average and honestly I would recommend you go there.

Every times, when I pass by any Ichiban Boshi resturant. There are long queue outside the resturant. This is my first time to try the resturant food. we waiting for 30 mintues to get a table. We order some sushi from the rotating conveyor. We order Gyoza, Shushi,Katsu Curry,Kaisen Anakake Name,Kajiki Sasumi.I try the Gyoza ... quite tasty. Also the Kaisen Anakake Name. The "Japanese steam egg with Chicken/Mushroom" is very nice and tasty! The scallop with vegetable is sweet and tasty! The food is good and value for money. (About S$80
