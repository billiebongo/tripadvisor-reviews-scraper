This is one of my Favourite stall. The fried chicken is tasty, succulent and crispy. Otah has a nice, spicy feel. The rice is unbroken, polished and higher grade type. Probably the best non-Muslim Nasi lemak in town. Better than Fong Seng.
4
Many varieties of food to choose from, most of which are local in origin.
Cheap and good food. Had the Fu Jian Xing Fa Lu Mian which was filled with ingredients... yummy
3
Stayed around this area for years. Tried most of the food but doesn't impress me. Very much prefer Balestier Road Market for food.
Bottled Beer wise, it is the cheapest in this area
4
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, take your pick. This hawker centre is open from early morning till late in the night. A very good place to have a broad spectrum of local food.
4
There are so many food to choose from; mostly are heavy in cholesterol so watch out but I'm telling you the carbs is worth it. If you want to have a different kind of dining experience or doing it just like the locals then this is a great place to be. You are not breaking your bank account by enjoying an authentic meal from the most expensive city in the world. Thai food is also present which is my personal fave .A so-called heaven for a backpacker like me; Plus the hawker owners were attentive and approachable.
5
There are 2 market side by side. In my opinion , I find the morning market food taste better. Must try in the morning market are china whampoa homemade noodle , peanut pancake , prawn noodle , tanglin carrot cake & the fish ball noodle in the center .

This afternoon, visited Whampoa Food Centre for simple lunch. It was 1.20pm and the crowded busy place was slightly warm due mid day heat. Saw queue at the fried kway teow stall in the middle row. Decided to try. Waited about12 minutes in the line. The non halal fried kway teow cost $3 per plate. Good portion for a person. Very dry and average taste. Could have been better if slightly wet
4
This food center is one of my favorite food joints and I love to visit this center because of the variety of local hawker food offered. There is the famous Hoover Rojak (local salad mixed with prawn paste) . The oyster with fried egg, fried Hokkien kway teow, fish head steam boat soup, as well as Muslim stalls which sell a variety of cooked dishes . There are also many desert stalls which sell soya bean curd, grass jelly , ice kachang, chengdol which is popular amongst the locals. A highly recommended place for good food at an affordable price . A good meal will cost less than S$10/- per head 
5
This place was near where we stayed. Short walk from Kim Keat Rd.Crowded at lunchtime, but look for the long lines and usually that's where you got the best food. Forget which stall, but he is on the corner always has line but sells the best chicken wings I have ever tasted
4
There are two section of this food center, the morning and after morning section. The morning section located just next to the market, with two long row of stall facing back to back. Lots of variety for breakfast, from carrot cake, economic fried bee hoon (a favorite for local), fish ball noodle, porridge, lor mee, wan tan noodle, prawn mee soup (not the fired Hokkien Prawn Mee), curry mixed rice, dumpling, kway chap, and basically all the standard is above average.If you visit after morning, for lunch or dinner, you will be at the other section across the carpark. There are more cooked food stall here. Some of the recommended are rojak (mixed fruit with black source), fried Hookkien Prawn noodle, fried oyster eggs, Malay mixed rice, Chinese mixed rice. Even at night, over at the morning section have a stall selling fish head steamboat in business.Overall is a cheap and good variety food center
5
Excellence in services and beers offering by Shop-owners Mr and Mrs Law, Good place for beers till 1am no GST no dress code and low keys of local residents A cool drink stop for my night cycle trips
3
Good variety and very cheap eats, almost like 12 dollars for two including beverage (non-alcoholic). Yet, most of the stuff tastes the same and not spicy at all. Can be crowded, cleanliness is average.
4
Been there several times and can get the typical hawkers centre experience. Value for money and different varieties of dmfood selection from Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai, Korean to almost every kind of south east Asian cuisine. For much cheaper rounds you around 5-10$.

On 3 December 2016 visited Whampoa Food Centre for lunch. Saw queue at Amoy Street Lor Mee ( 厦门街卤面) saw on their display rack their ingredients; realised that they serving the traditional teochew cuisine due fresh fried fish and braised pork. Many stalls do not prepare in this style anymore.Ordered a bowl ($4) of the noodles added with vinegar, it was really tasty reminding me of the old days. Really worth the 10+ minutes queue. Tbere are also few other good stalls that prepare tasty food. Great place for simple meal at affordable meal. Enjoyed.Patrons who drive need to wait patiently for parking lot. Limited spaces during peak hours.
5
Likely to be unnoticed, there's a great Teochew fish head steamboat tucked away in the morning section but which opens only at night. Really fresh ingredients. If fish head is not your thing, order the fantastic pomfret. Sides include slow braised duck and pig ear terrine
4
This is one of my favourite food centres in Singapore. Here you can taste a good variety of local food. I'm a regular customer to this place. It is usually very crowded during lunch time and weekends. My favourite stalls: Bedok Kway Chap, Whampoa Homemade Noodles, Lor Mee, Nasi Padang (Malay food), Chicken rice, Duck rice
5
This is a great place to experience some local food, as a tourist. You'll see 99% locals. It's an interesting place because it's somehow hidden - it doesn't have a big street and heavy traffic around. It offers the feeling of coziness. But don't get me wrong, it's a lively place and, in the evening, full of people. A lot of diversity in cuisine. Go for the long queues, locals know why are they queueing there. Also try some sugar cane juice and don't forget to ask the auntie to add lemon. Most lively at around 19:00-20:00. If you don't like crowded places avoid that time frame. Enjoy!

We asked our cab driver to take us to a place where we can have a real taste of Singapore. He took us to Whampoa. He says, this is where locals eat. Definitely, it is not that expensive compared to dining in restaurants but don't expect amenities and customer service. We ordered a huge serving of Singapore's famous Chili Crabs as well as Fried Oysters and some other dishes. Beer and drinks were much cheaper too in Whampoa. It was great but am not raving.
5
this is a food centre area.. clean and having variety of food but if you were moslem please be careful that most of food is 'non halal' food. I tried Laksa and manggo salad.. the Laksa is nice and tasty and manggo salad also nice. I will come again ☺
4
Our first meal was at Whampoa Food Center ...a few blocks from the hotel and a good 20 minutes walk.The place is clean. Food is prepared by the stall owners. The price is a fraction (S$5/pax) compared to the MallFood Court (S$10/pax) and the fine dining (S$40/pax).
3
This small hawker was behind the fresh fruits, vegetables and plants market.
We arrived the area around 2 p.m. on Sunday. There's 20+ choices of food stalls for you to pick. The Seating area look clean. Not many table though.
4
Everyone has something to like here, from traditional breafast stalls to new generation hawker stalls. Highly recommend fried hokkien prawn, western food, fish soups, BBQ Chicken Wings
5
There's nothing here that's not to like. For the day section, try the Lor Mee, prawn noodles, fritters, vegetarian, and soya curds. At night, make a beeline for the hokkien fried noodles, oyster omelette, thai food, BBQ chicken wings and pork tripe soup.
4
This place has a good variety of cheap local food. While some stalls close soon after lunch, there are many serving the dinner crowd which probably account for why it's mostly more crowded for dinner than lunch. There are many favorites. I like a corner stall that serves fish soup and fish head steamboat. The nasi lemak stall often serving a long queue. Hoover rojak has a long history. Middle row has a good oyster omelette.
1
I had prawn noodle from shop named 545. I saw long line which pulled my attention to try. Noodle is so so, but the terrible thing is surrounding there. I had dinner nearby an old Chinese man who spit up mucus every 5 min!!!! So dirty and I didn't expect this rude and dirty manner in Singapore. I definitely won't return to this place and I warn you if you pick this in yr list!!
5
1 of the 4 heavenly kings of chicken rice in Singapore.If you love chicken rice in Singapore, you should not miss out this traditional Hainanese chicken rice.As a local, this Loy Kee chicken rice (located @#01-49/50, Whampoa Makan Place, 91 Whampoa Drive) has a real traditional succulent taste in the 50s
4
We stayed at Balestier RD is just a walking distance. I wasn't familiar with the hawker style food area but I find this one fascinating. There were variety of food they sell and they have stall specializing in drinks only. Tried a couple of different menu's from different stalls and all were delish and cheap compared to restaurant food around the area. Serving size is also big enough to be shared
4
The Whampoa Hawkers Market is a collection of stalls, some of them tiny but each specializing in their own food or gifts, accessories etc.The food is strikingly different and totally fascinating. Fried oysters were superb, but one could spend days sampling various other foods.Well worth a visit; scrupulously clean.HINT: Look for the stalls with long lines of locals waiting - those are almost certainly the best aroun
5
Been coming here for years. The food here is very affordable (even for hawker center prices), and has some notable stalls.The Hokkien Mee and Nasi Lemak stalls can get fairly crowded during dinnertime (there may be a few, but just find the crowded ones!), but they are definitely worth the taste. The Oyster Omelette stall (I think it's called Huat Heng/Ah Huat?) is very tasty, but try and get there when there are less people; if there are lots of people waiting, the food quality can suffer a bit since it is all cooked in mass.Cheap soursop ice and chendol too

This hawker center is located at Blk 91 and Blk 92 Whampoa Drive. I drove my mum to Gor Chor Tua Pek Kong Temple along Balestier Road for praying and after the praying, I made a right turn at the traffic junction about 20 meters from the temple into Whampoa Drive and had our lunch at this hawker center. I came on weekend and both public car parks in front of the hawker center were full but I managed to secure a lot near to the food center within 5 mins. Beside the market area, the hawker center is divided into two sections: one caters to the breakfast and the other caters to lunch and dinner. The morning breakfast section was crowded with many senior citizens who came here to have their breakfast after their morning exercise as they were seen in exercise shorts and pants. It is really a good congregating place where seniors gathered to have their coffee and their favorite porridge or soya milk while engaged in weekend catch up chit chat sessions with their neighbors and friends. I went with my mum to the other section of the hawker center and there were four rows of hawker stalls for us to choose. It was a very difficult option as there were a wide variety of delicious foods to choose. Surprisingly, few stall names bear Whampoa on their signboard but instead many bear names of other places. I am not sure if these stalls were moved to this place from other hawker centers but I saw stall names like Joo Chiat fried noodles stall, famous Bedok Kway Chap, Ah Hock Fried Oyster Hougang and Tanglin Halt A1 carrot cake. As I walked around the hawker center I was impressed with the many culinary awards and gourmet food news articles and decals displayed on many of the stall counters. It clearly demonstrated that their dishes were well received by their customers and reflected their real culinary arts. It was not a boastful act and it was not easy to win or be presented with the awards if their dishes lack the substance. Some stalls even displayed photographs taken with famous Hong Kong film star Chow Yuen Fatt, our ex-President S Nathan and some of our Members of Parliament or Minister. It showed that these stalls were really outstanding and even celebrities came here to taste their food. I like hawker center food. They are reasonably and comparatively cheap and the eating environment clean and orderly. It is a unique culture of Singapore and tourists should not miss the opportunity to try some of the hawker foods. And one such food center is this Whampoa Food Center. I particularly fancied the Balestier Road Rojak Hoover; they were a unique dish you hardly find in Singapore. One full sumptuous plate cost just $4/- and $5/-. You should try this. I also saw long queue of customers at the Liang Zhao Kee Duck Porridge stall, the 168 Curry stall, the Dessert stall, the Robert Mee Siam stall. It is really a gourmet paradise right here. I shall come again and to hope to try the dishes of all these stalls
4
The chicken curry rice shop had about 30 people lined up. Must be really good. Total of about 100 food outlets to choose from.
It was raining that day, quite cool.
5
must go and try their famous Rojak super good we had 2 plates. After that must try the duck porridge beside the Roja stall very good. Long queue must be patient. we queue for 15 minutes for the duck porridge.
5
Prata and martabak very delicious. Western food taste great with a lot of flexibility (could change rice for potato etc). Whampoa prawn noodle, the best prawn noodle. Clean hawker. Cheap price.
4
Most foods Start from 4 SGD. Asian, Western, European food stalls. Selling fruits and flowers nearby. Close to Value Hotel Balestier, close to Fragrance Hotel Rose and close to Hotel 81 Balestier.
4
A stone's thrown from my hotel, the food court offers cheap and tasty food with a huge vegetarian selection, which is just such a godsend after China! Plastic chairs, almost clean cutlery and friendly smiles all around. I know where i shall be eating during my brief stay here... Lovely atmosphere
5
I spent the 1st 15 years of my life living in this area. Till this day, the Whampoa Food Center remains one of the best hawker center in my opinion. Travellers will need to note that there are actually 2 spereate compounds - 1st is more of a lunch and dinner market while the other is a breakfast market that is connected to the fresh food market (wet market). The perfect breakfast in my opinion would (1) A plate of Mee Siam or the Prawn Noodle Soup, (2) fried carrot cake sticks, (3) mug of cold soy milk
4
The rojak there is very nice ,delicious, reasonable price. ust be honest. Praise almost never goes unnoticed! (and if it does, shame on management!) If we have great food, service or a problem quickly solved, I will always go to the restaurants website and name both waitstaff and management. I've always had very positive responses. I think most places do "reward" positive feedback. If you can, name your server. Then say what you liked about the experience
5
It is my first time to get a real hawker experience in Singapore, and the makan place at the Whampoa drive is such a lovely place. Food is definitely sumptuous, and also offer a wide array of food selection. The design of the building and the arrangement of shops are quite neat and with good ventilation. I will definitely go back to this place every time I am in Singapore
5
Went here with work colleagues. Ate here 2 nights in a row. Food was consistently good and the price was amazing. We took a taxi from the hotel we were staying in to get here on the after asking a taxi driver where HE would eat. Not where a tourist should go, not where a Westerner would go, but if he was hungry and wanted good variety...and he suggested this place. So not claiming to be Anthony Bourdain (sshhh...the chicken rice place IS over-rated), but this place served a great purpose.The most expensive thing we paid for was the beer. And the price of the beer (about $6 Sing' dollars) would have covered 3 dishes! We tried the stalls where the ratings were "A" - means they've been checked and achieved a cleanliness rating. Also the ones where locals were lining up. Seafood Hokkien Mee - you can order a small $2.50, medium $3 or large serving. Charcoal grilled chicken wings with side serving of hot sauce.Sugar cane drink.Sour plum drink.Laksa ($3.50 I think?)Char Keow Tiao (not that great but ok)Curry puffsMutton soupBBQ porkThere was also a whole bunch of other things we didn't try crab, tofu, bak kut teh, grilled fish, prawns...but we missed out as we arrived late and they start selling out or closing around 9ish. Be warned, they DO sell out of stuff, which is a good thing, too because it means the food is FRESH! Lots of locals. We saw no white people. We were well fed. :
5
I was brought to the hawker centre by a few local friends. Though it is a hawker store, it is nice and tidy and clean. We went there in the morning but you don't feel hot inside as the ceiling is quite high and so the ventilation is good. There are many variety of stores there selling various local dishes like prawn noodles, pancake, beancurd, curry rice, rice noodles, green bean soup , fried dough etc. You will surely get something that you fancy. If you have no idea what you want , simply follow the queues. Popular stores have long queue and you won't be wrong.Had I stay longer, I could go there everyday for breakfast and won't be bored
4
Plenty of variety. Good cheap food.
Open late over the weekends. Chinese cuisine is the best bet here. Overall cleanliness can be improved.
5
Every type of food at affordable prices and open all day and night from chicken/char siew.roast pork/duck rice, all types of noodles kway chap, mixed rice, grill fish, hokkien mee, steamboat, porridge, double boil soup, indian, muslim, western (even steak !)
4
Wide varieties of vegetables, meat & fish dishes to choose from
Dislike: cleaners not cleaning tables clean & dry enough for next customer.
5
Lots of local food served here.
Open nearly 24hrs with long queues for selected stalls.Try their rojak
4
Food is cheap cheap n tasty. Might be a bit less hygienic to some, but it wouldn't be matter to tourists who truly 'love hawker food' like locals!!!
4
I will always associate Whampoa Market to Duck Porridge and Rojak simply because for the most part of my childhood, my parents would love to come here on weekends just to patronise the Duck Rice/Porridge Stall. I don't even recall the name of the stall but I know by heart where the stall is located.On this occasion, however, I didn't eat Duck Porridge. I had a craving for Minced Meat noodles but didn't want to queue for the Lavender Street version so I opted for a stall called "Merchant Road Minced Meat Noodles. No Frozen Pork." which sounded delicious and smelt heavenly too.And I was right.The soup had all the liver goodness that was cooked in it and with ample spring onions added to it, it makes for a delicious companion to the bowl of noodles. I loved the springiness of the noodles coupled with adequate sauce/vinegar/chilli. The pork is indeed fresh and not of the frozen variety as you can literally taste the sweetness of the meat.This stall comes highly recommended if you're craving for Minced Meat Noodles and want to avoid lengthy queues for the Lavender Street version.Overall, there are many options like Char Kuay Teow, Nasi Lemak, Fish Soup, Carrot Cake, Chicken Rice etc for you to choose from. Good and cheap hawker food
4
They had a variety of food for a fair price. 4 adults could have a complete meal for Singapore $ 20 max. But first you should explore and find about what each stall serves. Stall owners are very friendly and will help to find what you need. The cleanliness of he serving area could be improved more. Overall it provides a perfect spot for a exploring tourist to experience a variety of food without much trouble
4
I had breakfast here two days in a row. It's two blocks from the Quality Hotel Marlow, and the food is much better and more varied than at the Quality Inn. Just point at the dishes you want to select and hold out some Sing dollars; everybody is VERY honest and thrilled to have your patronage. Also -- very good milky coffee, from the coffee vendors
5
What I like about this place? Too many to list....But the Nanyang Coffee TOPS my list. Excellent coffee at unbeatable price! Next up? Fried prawn noodles (look for the long queue corner stall with the lady standing on a stool to take orders), wanton noodles (Joo Chiat 30+ years old stall), chicken rice (the stall with the most chicken hanging)....the list goes on
4
Been here to tried the hokkien mee after recommendation from some friends and it is really good!!! You can get a wide variety of good local food and itis open till quite late. Cleaniness wise, it is on par with the other hawker centres in Singapor
4
Its a place that gives you a nice local experience. Spend an evening here to taste some nice cheap food, have a Tiger beer, chill and observe people.
4
so many food in here.and all look very nice.
this place good for drink and eat
this place also clean enough
5
This place is what you call good food,almost everything here is good,prices are reasonable and food is yummy,this place is also well located so its a highly recommended place.if tourist only go to Clarke or marina,still be sure to come here,u won't regret it!
4
There are varieties of food available in the food court. I love the kueh chap the most. However the char kueh teow is really below par.
4
Wide selection of good food from stores which have been around for decades. Famous ones are the Rojak, Braised Duck (these two food stores are next to each other), Hokkien Mee, Oyster Omelette, Teochew Fish Porridge.
4
Famous for rojak!
3
Oyster omelette, duck rice and chicken rice are great
4
We visited before lunchtime on Monday and the place was not crowded at all but we walked around on the weekend and it was very full.My husband really loved the rojak and I enjoyed the duck rice bought from a stall next to the rojak. The juices from the juice stall were also nice despite the old lady serving us didn't understand much English
4
There are 2 food centres here: Blk 90 which opens mostly in the evening and Blk 91 which cater mostly to the morning and lunch time crowd. They are frequented mainly by locals as probably few tourists are aware of them unless their local friends bring them for a real local treat.In Blk 90, the popular stores are the Hoover Rojak, Hoover Fish Porridge and the Singapore Fried Hokkien Mee, but the one that I like best is the Hock Chew Fish Ball noddle next to the steamboat store. It seems the store has closed or moved elsewhere the last time I visited the market.The 545 Whampoa prawn noddle store in Blk 91 has a long queue every morning throughout, The Loy Kee Chicken Rice is one of the few stores that are still open for business in the evening in Blk 91.As always, Blk 90 can be extremely crowded on a weekend evening so be prepared to wait for up to 30 minutes at the Rojak store, or head for the Loy Kee Chicken Rice across in Blk 91
4
This is the modern equivalent of the old parking lot with the street vendors of the past. Go here for a taste of the real Singapore where real people live and eat. You pay very little for food and can try fish head curry, fresh juices and lots more. Worth a visit
5
I love hawker food!!
4
Food quality has got worse. It was excellent at every stall but stalls like "bah chor mee" lost the quality in their soup and so on.... But their coffee stall is still the best!
3
Can stay here for breakfast, lunch & dinner.
5
Must go!!!! Lots of local food.
4
Lots of good food here - great value for $. Try the Hoover Fish Slice soup, Famous Rojak, Fried Oyster, BBQ Chicken Wings, Fish hotpot, Braised Duck Rice.
5
The rojak is very nice... the best in SG!
4
Rojak, chicken rice and very thick papaya milk shake.
4
Affordable and tasty food available. Great place to eat after the renovation. But some famous stalls have moved out. Miss those good food.
3
Average. Tried the Fish Soup there but nothing spectacular. Will try more food there.
4
When i need some comfort food where do i head to......Whampoa Food Center- the homemade fishball noodles are excellent and The Hoover Rojak is quite piquant and yummy -hmmm....quite a tough fight with the rojak from Duman Food Centre though. Thank God! The market has been upgraded so it looks rather decent now
5
My all time fav beef noodles is there!! The rojak is also really good.
4
the 'hur tao lor' fishhead steamboat thingy is yum... so is the orh lua and many more!
5
One of my fav food center
3
great place for supper.. very nice fried oyster! crispy!
5
best rojak in town
5
Just renovated. However, crowded and may have problem looking for a carpark lot and seat
4
Love the morn fish ball noodle n nite fish head steamboat (same stall), wanton noodle, nite hokkien mee, rojak & noon cai fan. Best of the Bests!
5
Great local hawker hangout
4
