Most of the dishes in the set menu were deepfried fare. After a few dishes, all tasted similar to each other. Service as above average though.

There are two Nature Vegetarian Delights outlets, one is located at Upper Serangoon Shopping Center and another one at Hougang ave 7. Personally I like Hougang outlet more because the food there is more affordable than Serangoon outlet. Try their prata and bak chor mee, super yummy!
