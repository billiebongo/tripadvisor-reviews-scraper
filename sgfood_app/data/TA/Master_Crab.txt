Affordable, tasty crab in a no frills surroundings, Master Crab warrants an out of the way visit. It was quiet when we visited but it was a Sunday evening. Shared two crabs between two which was plenty. Chilli crab was better than the egg crab in my opinion (its an acquired taste). Service is quick. Expect to get messy

Recommended by our friend, we decided to try the food here. Heard they served yummy crabs but as we were in a hurry, decided to keep the crabs for another day when we have more time to enjoy the crabs. Our friend ordered the pork, prawns,clay pot chicken as well as a vegetable dish. Thought the standard of the good was quite good. Will definitely return for more...

Went there two person and ordered the famous Chilli Crab. We decided to have a big crab rather than 2 small crabs (cheaper i feel, crabs are a bit pricey). The crab served was big and the meat was fresh and sweet. Together with the crab, the paste was nice too, different but outstanding compared to the chilli crabs paste in malaysia. Would recommend people to eat crab but it's a bit pricey, it was 65SGD per kg for the crab

Went there twice in a week as I needed to host my overseas relatives/guests for dinner. Tried the famed Chilli crabs and black pepper crabs. Surprisingly both sets of my guests from different days preferred the black pepper crab. The place is not really conducive and the food servers are curt but fast in their service. Don't expect any good service like you will receive in a restaurant. This place is a food court in a HDB neighbourhood.

Friends living in Singapore took four of us here for dinner and it was very very good!We left all the ordering to them and had three types of crab - chilli, peppered and steamed. The first two were our favourites and we all 'mucked in' and demolished everything including some buns and rice.Yes, definitely take more napkins to wipe your hands and a great place to eat.Be aware that the restrooms are not great :-

A great local place to eat in a no frills local Hawker Centre. Master Crab was recommended by a Singaporean friend. We've been a couple of times. The locals are generally quite fascinated to see foreigners eating there. Its not in the city but out at Buena Vista just above the mrt station, next to very near a small bus terminal and taxis are easy to come by.We've tried chilli, peppered and steamed crab and all are great. Our friends agree that its the best they've had and so reasonably priced compared to the restaurant chains. I also enjoy the good selection of vegetables and the Hong Kong noodles are another of my favourites. The staff are busy but helpful and friendly.The restrooms aren't that nice.Bring an additional set of your own crackers as they usually provide only one set if you have a larger crowd.If you phone and book a table then its usually waiting for you ready or one is cleared very quickly for you

We went to the Master Crab closest to Buona Vista MRT. We ordered the sweet and sour pork, deep fried chicken, yang chow fried rice and Gai lan. Plus of course their famous crabs - one in the salted egg sauce and the other chilli. I loved all the food we ordered. My favourite was the salted egg crab. There was a lot of sauce and we ordered 3 plates of man tau to eat up all the sauce. Yum yum!Found it very good value for money. Would definitely go there again.

I've had 2 types of Salted Egg Crab- dry rub and wet. This crab at Master Crab has a sauce and I think it's the absolute best! I live in NYC and travel often to Singapore to see family. I will always ask to stop there and eat salted egg crab. It's not glamorous or high-end. It's just amazing. Just remember to bring extra tissue to wipe your hands

I love to eat crabs. they are delicious and so yummy for my taste buds. I like their service and of cos their wonderful crabs which satisfy my hunger.

We brought some relatives over to eat some authentic local food. It was nice and fresh from the vegetables to crab. The only drawback was the price which we found very expensive for local food even given that we ate one crab.

Big crabby available in this restaurant. I love the chilli crab and the salted egg crab. Nearest station will be Buana Vista, approximately 5 mins walking distance from the MRT station.

Most dishes tastes quite good except the crabs, which are rather normal, in fact, slightly below average to me. Don't know why they are called "Master Crabs"

1st time been to the Master Crab @ Ghim Moh branch. Enjoy eating the salted egg crabs and drunken prawns but their chilli crab is a disappointment.
4
This is my first time eating crabs at Master Crab. The location that we went is at the coffee shop at Block 19 Ghim.Moh. We ordered their salted egg crab and crab with glass noodle, personally I prefer the salted egg crabs. Best to come with Manton. We also ordered their prawn paste chicken, pumpkin taufu and yam ring, not bad too.Overall dining experience at this crab shop are not bad

Being an avid seafood foodie, I was introduced to this "restaurant" by a local friend a few years ago, and on each trip to Singapore, this would be a mandatory visit.We've lost count of the number of times we've eaten at Master Crab @ Ghim Moh, but other than on 2 occasions, we had not been disappointed. Our favourite dish is the salted egg crabs, which by far is the tastiest of their other styles of cooking. We've also tried other dishes on their menu over the years, but other than a small selection (such as the cereal prawns and pumpkin tofu), they were not standout dishes. There was nothing wrong with them, mind you. It's just that we're being very picky, dining at this level.If not for the high prices, and the location (which have nothing to do with the food), I would have given it a 5 star rating. However, this would not deter me from returning again, and again.Worth an experience if you've not been to this eatery before

Very awesome. Helpful and friendly staff. Though located in the hearts of a coffeeshop, zhi char stall, but the standard is totally comparable to those in a restaurant. Been there a few times and totally will recommend friends and relatives to visit for crab feast :

I had been told about the salted egg crab at the Ghim Moh branch for a few years now so this trip to Singapore I had to try them. I thought that the quality of the crabs was the best I've had in Singapore. Perfectly cooked and incredibly fresh/flavourful. The sauce was very pleasant... a tad sweet but with lots of character. I take a looooooot of time eating crabs and each bit of this one was a true enjoyment. The prawn toast were crunchy and with excellent quality prawns as well. The satays wer average with the sauce being quite yummy.Im rating the atmoshphere low just because its a plastic table and beer joing. Great with shorts, slippers and a relaxed attitude

In Ghim Moh market ...Simple and basic ..Chilli crab was not the best I have tasted but I did enjoy the salted egg crab .I have no complaints about the way it was cooked or the tasteVeg nice and fresh Some complain it is expensive for the area ( S$40 per crab ) ...but if you live in the area...it is the best place for crab by far in my opinion Open until 01.30 too

I had tried salted egg crab in singapore, but I think here is the best as price and taste.
Even though, this restaurant is considered as hawker food court, but it is really crowded.
Black pepper crab is also nice. Must try both!!
5
We went with a large group. Enjoyed all of the dishes we shared, particularly the chili crab. Service was excellent.

Glad we finally tried Master Crab, it had been recommended by numerous people. Food was delicious, reasonable prices (for Singapore). Service is adequate considering it's not a formal restaurant. will definitely be returning.

Bought crabs twice from this stall at Punggol branch blk 108, found out my crabs have been swapped to a smaller crab despite the explanation from cashier that the chef might has accidently swap to another crab but definitely the same size. 1st time i bought a male crab about 1kg but found out it has been changed to a smaller female crab upon reaching home, 2nd time ordered 1kg Sri Lankan male crab and again it was changed to a smaller vietnamese crab with fluffy meat meaning it could be a dead/freeze crab. What a dishonest stall, cheating customers money by offering live crabs at the stall front but change to other crabs in the kitchen

Been here several times in the past and was satisfied. Was with family here for dinner to celebrate labour day. However this time had a crab that was full of urine/ammonia taste. Commented to the staff on it and they just brushed it off with what seemed to be a polished response that probably the chef chopped the urine duct. Questionable on their ethics if the they still serve the crab even with the smell!They did not even offer to check out the crab or to change it. Dissappointed with this place now

We've been craving for salted egg crabs so we visited this place bec of good reviews and it's near our home. It was good but a bit pricey for a hawker place. We asked for extra sauce of the salted egg but they say there's an extra charge of $3. Everything has extra charges nowadays there. Their home made tofu was bad. We didn't finish eating it and regretted agreeing to the recommendation of the waitress. The 3 cups chicken was good. We will think twice of going there again if we crave for crabs in the future

Ate here with a group of friends on a Friday evening. The place was very crowded but if you like to experience the Singaporean hawker-style eating, the hectic-scene was somewhat enjoyable.We had the salted egg crab, black pepper crab, chili crab and cereal prawns, along with fried mantao buns to clean the overflowing sauces. Given the portion and taste, I'd say the price is very worth it
5
Saw some other reviews and knew that they're good with salted egg crabs and other crab dishes, and that their other dishes are so-so. To my surprise - we enjoyed the french beans with dried shrimps, prok ribs, homemade beancurd, stuffed beancurd skin, and special seafood fried rice alot! Not to mention their specialty - salted egg crab and chilli crab

Just came back from Master Crab. Yup, no doubt it USED to be super but now...hmmmm...sadly, it's currently close to cra$. It was not our first time there, to be fair. It warranted a couple of return visits but as of this evening, it came to a boil. Rule of the evening: each table (regardless of size) has to order TWO crabs at S$40+ each. Why? Becos they ran out of large crabs. So, we went to a place called "Master Crab" and ate anything but CRAB. mind you, this place used to be good but the establishment has gone loonie. Sad. :

We live nearby and see that it's always busy and they had delivious looking pictures of crabs done on do many different ways So had to try it. First mistake was to go on a busy Sunday evening. The waitresses were quite rude when we tried to go up to the counter to order. Told us to sit down. No one came to take our order although we kept asking. Order was eventually taken > half an hour after sitting down. Food took almost an hour to come. My sons were on too bad mood to enjoy the food by then. Go only if you really like crab. It's a coffee shop Czech char stall after all.
