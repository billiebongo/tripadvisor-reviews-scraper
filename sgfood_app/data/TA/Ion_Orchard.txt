Padang Padang hawker stall rip off.
Frozen (not even defrosted) fried chicken, uncooked rice, miserable staff, nothing like any nasi padang in the real world and S$7.90 for an inedible plate of rubbish

This Haagen Dazs outlet is on the 4th floor of the Ion Orchard mall.
Called in here for afternoon coffee together with a HÃ¤agen-Dazs Crunch - ice cream, fresh fruit and crunchy granola - just the right way to relax after wandering around the mall.

Filled with various high end botiques, fancy restaurants and classy shops. But then again so are the other neighboring malls within the vicinity. And with the oversaturation of malls situated in Orchard Road, Ion Orchard is just another typical flower in the garden.

Ion Orchard is one of the major shopping malls in Singapore and also the home of the MRT Station. It does get incredibly busy at certain times of the day so expect to be bumped and knocked particularly by mobile phone zombies! It's a mixture of shops and restaurants with some interesting specialist shops.There is an amazing grocery shop called Jason's if you need a fix of proper cheese, good bread and all manner of goodies. Good shop to visit near Christmas as well!There's a good mix of restaurants including Indonesian, Thai and Chinese some being more authentic than others. We don't think this is the best Shopping Mall in Singapore but worth a look around and it is convenient for the MRT station

Ion orchard is an complete mall. The mrt pass under the mall. Ion has upscale brand on up level but it has store with normal price at basement. Also has restaurante eith good price and food court . Daiso and post office that open on Sunday. Mention also sky view for free on 54 floor with 360 panoramic view. Super futuristic facade that make a good picture to you send to your friends

The mall and building is good, great choices. However, stuff is ridiculously expensive!! Even the food court is way too expensive. We paid a whopping 60 SGD for just 3 waffle ice creams.There are many better places outside ion orchard. Don't waste time here unless you are super rich or would just like respite from heat/rain

This is the area that is filled to the brim with various high end botiques and fancy restaurants, as in all malls within the proximity, that makes more choices for the shoppers to decide where to go. Other than that, just be prepared to make that long walk over the maze of shops everywhere. However, this area tends to be so crowded more over the weekends
