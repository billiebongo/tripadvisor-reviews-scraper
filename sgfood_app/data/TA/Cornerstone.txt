Great place for brunch and to chill.
Would be a better environment to have sound diffusion to lower the level of noise in the restaurant.

My lovely friends organised a surprise baby shower at Cornerstone. As always, the food was great, friendly service and the owner hosted us in a VIP room. It's a perfect experience with great food, goods value and a relaxing atmosphere.

We went at about 10am. The restaurant just opened. There were a few other families. Service was slow. The manager/owner explained that there were multiple orders at the same time and only one chef had reached. We waited at least half an hour for the food. In addition, we were displeased with the customer service provided by the waiter and the waitress. They did not bother to explain or try to make us feel better. They seemed to be just going through motion. The saving grace was the food - we ordered Cornerstone Big Platter, Honeyed Bacon & Eggs Waffle, Cornerstone Rosti, Hot Chocolate and Cafe Latte. The food and drinks were satisfactory in terms of quantity and quality. Hope there would be significant improvement in the customer service

Dining place in the middle of the park (near to Capark A). The BBQ pork ribs are excellent with no strong porky smell and flavourful. Love the buffalo wings, go for Level 3 and above if you dare to take the spiciness. Definitely must leave some room for desserts. The earl grey Jivara never fails me!Good for couples, families and gathering with friends. The outdoor dining area allows guests to bring their pets along while they dine. Choose the indoor seating if you worry about feeling too warm

they took a longgggg time to serve our dishes even though it was after 130pm on a Sunday. The staff also served us wrong food and could not understand me clearly when I asked about if onions were in the dish. Prices can be lower for this mediocre service

Have our romantic dinner there.Everything was fine,from service to food.But the steak we ordered is cold and not worth the price we paid.Although is not crowded on weekday.There's out door seating for those who bring their's dog there.Waithelp was excellence,in answering your question and service..Hope the management look into the pricing and food standard.

Known within my group for one of the few best buffalo wings in Singapore. We also love the pork knuckles, but be prepared for a 20-30 mins wait. Trick is to call & order before you arrive.Also, the lamb main course is recommended.Do look out for promotions. I got a free cake under NTUC during birthday month

Cornerstone - located in Bishan Park is a nice dining place with a nice ambience. Staff are friendly and location is convenient. The pork belly, lamb are good but suggest lesser salt if you're not one who likes salty food. Serving is decent and not too overwhelming. A nice place to relax , enjoy with family and friends

Cornerstone is just the right corner for a quiet dining experience with a good listening friend. It was a cool afternoon with short splatter of rain the day I went and I guess that was a good time because the restaurant was quiet and there were only 2 groups of diners. The ambience was good and the service was excellent! The rib eye steak recommended by the waiter, one of its signature dish, was truly delicious that cooked to the right tenderness. But it could be better if a little less salt is added. Overall, the dining experience was very good. The food still lingers in the stomach that evening that dinner had to be skipped. I would come back again with my family to share the 'feel good' experience

My hubby and I often dine here with our dogs. The food is quite good. We love the buffalo wings and the pulled pork sandwiches. The service is warm and friendly although it is a little hard trying to get the attention of the staff when we are seated in the alfresco section.

The restaurant offers the western food with various type of wine and beer. It was good place to your meal at the middle of nature.

We just walked in after evening at Bishan Park. The setting was quite nice as its within the Park's lush landscape. We had Caesar's Salad, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Slow Smoked Beef Brisket, Hokkaido Grilled Squid, and Spaghetti Carbonara. The Salad was de-luscious - it came with a poached egg, when broken, the yolk oozed down and mixed into the dressing, and crispy bacon. It was super rich. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was juicy, with the lightly toasted slightly sweet bread, still soft on the inside. The brisket was flavourful, slow-cooked over how many hours til tender. The grilled squid was nicely marinated, grilled to perfection, not rubbery as some squid tend to be. The Carbonara was rich and creamy, pasta perfectly al-dente. I was impressed, the whole dining experience made our night. And when it came time for the bill, it was just $100-00. My only regret - should have ordered more, stayed on, and moved outside to sit in the balcony with wine and dessert, to while the night away

Strongly recommended to visit for family dinner after a walk around the park. The food is delicious with the price slight above average.Should try the buffalos wings, Cesar salads and the pork knuckles. Avoid the cod fish as it is quite a small portion.Wine selection not a lot but I have tried the house wine, was good for me.

Lovely location, in the middle of AMK-Bishan Park surrounded with lush trees, comfortable al fresco seating, nice inside aircon dining, inspiring menu, great welcome from staff. Nice furniture. Small children can run around and not bother others. BUT, coffee took 30+ minutes to arrive! And so was the food which was not served at the same time and was not warm enough. Poached egg was watery. Caffe latte was like a glass of hot milk. Iced black was thin. Really sad because this place has a great potential. Hope they improve the food quality and the service as I do want to come back.

We suggested to our friends to try out this restaurant as it is well loved by park goers and a great getaway from the routine busy life. The pullpork salad was simply awesome! Tangy pork strips coupled with crunchy vege! The full platter breakfast was equally value for money. The waitress was kind enough the split the bill in 3s without fuss. Superb customer service

I recently had lunch at Cornerstone, in Bishan Park. It's a pleasant place with a beautiful outdoor deck that overlooks the park. The food was decent, and the price for the set lunch was very reasonable. My pulled pork sandwich was nicely done, on bread that had been toasted in butter (a nice touch). The best part about this place is that it's in an old building in Bishan Park that's been beautifully renovated and refurbished. I would definitely return here, I'm curious to see what their dinners are like

3-course set lunch was of pretty good value. Spaghetti Bolognese was creamy and quite a big single serve. Caesar salad was well 'dressed' and mixed. BBQ chicken was a teeny bit too sweet and chicken could probably do with an extra 3-5 minutes more heating.Chiffon cake was really light yet tasty, rich in flavours

My regular hangout place...Buffaloes wings my favourite where you can choose the spicy level from mild to very very fury hot!!!! You can find different varieties of food to choose from like Japanese to western so I can bring my mom over who prefer rice while I can take western meals

You know when you are looking for an inexpensive luxury? Cornerstone is it. The atmosphere is not intimidating. The food is great, I hope they keep up with their drink offers. 2 Guiness for $14. NICE!! The dessert is awesome. You could come here just for that. Then there is their brunch menu. Feels fresh too. carpark is right in front of the restaurant and needless to say, since it's at Bishan- Ang Mo Kio Park, you can go for a nice stroll after..or vice versa, you can go for your walk and stop to have drink here. I think this will be my new hang out. Oh.. and you see their pancake brunch for their icon?? IT's very very nice. Fluffy pancakes with heaps of sides. Their Big3 sausage brunch is enjoyable too. You SHOULD come and try the restaurant here. I know I will be back soon!! It gives a nice feeling after your dine in and not too big a hit on your wallet

Overall, neither remarkable, neither terrible. Service is not great and twice I visited, there were no more than 4 tables filled. Unless you have business in the park, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to come here.Had pork ribs, oxtail pasta, rack of lamb ribs, fish and chips, buffalo wings.Buffalo wings comes with different levels of heat. Every time you go up a level, you also throw down more money. Didn't like that.Fish and Chips batter was good, very light. But if you've had good ones in the UK, this is not remarkable. But good by Singapore standards, I guess. No option for salt and vinegar. Frozen fish was not the freshest of frozen fish. Had a smell.Lamb ribs not over done. Warm pink as requested.Oxtail pasta was boring.Pork ribs is the dry smoked type. If you prefer it doused in BBQ sauce, you won't like this.This review covers two visits, in Dec 2014 and February 2015. One with family, one with friends

I just the ambience. ... away from the busy area. We sat outside for a meal and it was just awesome. Food is good but they have a limited choices on the menu. Overall it's a nice place to hang out than usual city cafes/restaurants.

Love the location, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Great place to relax. Chicken wings and luncheon meat fries were sinful but good!
5
Went there for lunch and the location is very nice. Good natural light and a very attentive service. Food was just OK as the Risotto was overcooked but well balanced.....a pity. Salmon filet was really very good and same goes for a seafood pasta. All portions were nice but the bad acoustics are a real issue as it was not even full but really very noisy and hard to listen what a person on the other side of a 6 pax table was talking

Was there with my family of 4 this afternoon. We had salad, calamari, chicken cutlet with rice, squid inky pasta and burgers. Each and every dish was fresh and delicious. The burgers were juicy and melt in the mouth. We had a seat on the balcony as we brought Fluffy, our toy poodle.The ambience was awesome! There was dog adoption drive and we could watch the mingling of dogs and human from where we were sitting. The service staff were professional and polite. Though it was full house with people and their furry animal, the service was excellent. Kudos to the Cornerstone team

Free parking on Sunday at Bishan Park which is a plus point for us. Its was tea timebso we had a cup of Flat White (you can tell that this is either a Aussie ran cafe or a local who has been in Australia for number of years and has been exposed to Aussie cafe) and Earl Grey Jivara. The latte is just latte however I thought the Earl Grey Jivara was something interesting. The hint of Earl Grey was there and the 'cake' itself was sweet but not overly sweet. The tiny marshmallows were soft and blended well with the dessert. Ambience was very much family dining oriented however one can sit outside to enjoy the park, fresh air and have their pet next to them if they brought one along. There are a good mixed of crowd from locals to expats staying around the area but majority came as a family. Overall a good experience in this restuarant but I thought the crews need to pay more attention to their diners as I noted diners had a hard time getting the crews attention for their bills, topping up of ice water and getting their ectra orders

Every beer drinker should know the different taste between good cold beer like carlsberg, heineken, hoegarden or erdinger etc...we ordered a jug of draught heineken beer after dinner. After drinking one sip, we all knew the beer has gone flat with wierd taste and spoke politely to the manager and feedback. She mentioned that they had abandon the old barrel of beer and changed to a new barrel in the afternoon and offered to change to a jug of erdinger instead and top up the price of $7 which we agreed. After the first erdinger jug, we wanted another jug but she informed us that their heineken beer has no problem and if we wanted to order another jug of erdinger we would need to top addition money again $3 more again which we find it ridiculous. The staff whom tasted a sip earlier agreed their heineken barrel has some issue yet the manager whom did not taste denied the problem and insisted its our (4 persons) taste buds problem. So we just pay and walk over to canopy next door. Its not the price but the service required as a consumer

I have been to Cornerstone for many times as the foods are good & the deserts taste delicious especially their America Cheesecake. I have even packed the deserts home to consume & they taste just as good. Except for the fact that some deserts are not meant for take away which is a bit of a disappointment for me, everything including their service are fine. I will still visit them in future

My family and i loves the food here and it is just about the only item that brings us back at least once a month.However with the ever turnstile of wait staff, the service aspect of the restaurant hasn't matched its choices and flavours of food.Case in point, we know from past experience all FOOD whether ordered off the entrée or main sections of the menu will arrive at pretty much the same time and obv. this is not ideal at all, in order to mitigate this issue of the wait or kitchen staff simply overlooking the "order" of the food selections, we specify to the wait staff during the order that certain food are entrée and it must be served first, wait, cleared away and then cook / serve the main dishes. Alas, the staff still failed at this very specific instruction. *sigh

Chicken wings (spice level 3) is our favorite. Goes well with our wines!My girl friend and i frequent this place often for happy hour. Decent and reasonably priced wines. Great ambience and staffs are friendly and helpful. Occasionally we will indulge in the desserts.. Yum

Came here after having lunch at Canopy, as my colleague said it served better coffee here.My friends already had a table and had their coffee when we arrived. 2 other persons had left, and their drinks were still left on the table throughout the time that the 3 new arrivals (me included) were there. No one bothered to clear up what was obviously used by the previous patron. They also did not offer us another new glasses of water.We ordered 2 cappucinos, a long black and their pineapple crumble / coconut panna cotta / vanilla ice cream to share ($12)It came and is an average sized portion but one can't complain because it seemed to be 3 desserts in one :) And the pineapple crumble was delicious. The filling is abit like the ones in pineapple tarts, and if you think like that thick sweet syrupy pineapple, you won't like this but I do. The crumble was excellent and my colleague agreed with me. The panna cotta was decent and the ice cream was average. However, the coffee took forever to brew, and had not come even after we finished our dessert. When we called to the waiter (to ask about dessert), he didn't even seem to hear (and I have a loud voice). After what seemed to be an age and a half, we finally saw someone making the coffee. Were they waiting for the single barrista who could possibly be taking a toilet or cigarette break?There were 4 waiters hanging around and only our 1 table to serve. I dread to think what service would be like in a full restaurant.Might not come back again, though the pineapple crumble would certainly be tempting. And of course the ambience, being in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio park
