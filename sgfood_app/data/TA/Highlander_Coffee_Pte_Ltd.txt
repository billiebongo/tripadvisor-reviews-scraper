Iâ€™ve stayed here for 10 years and been here multiple times. Never have I thought about writing a review about this place.
The coffee is tops. The service is tops. The prices are decent.

Finally we came here after many years of talk. We ordered iced mocha and iced roasted almond latte. Both are smooth and great taste. If they have more cake selection, it would be a great place after dinner. Cheers!

The coffee was simply excellent. I had a latte and could have drunk 2 or 3 cups. Service was great. A very friendly place and the coffee is perfect. The croissant was great as well.

Great coffee roasted on site with a range to suit most tastes. A small seated area but well positioned if your visiting Singapore hospital and need take away or a short coffee meeting place

One of the few places in singapore where you're always greeted with a big smile. Very homely and the coffee is great. I visit regularly as its close to work. The food selection is limited, but I highly recommend the tandoori chicken wrap

I was finally successful in visiting this place today after several failed previous attempts (mainly because it is a little far out of the city area and it's closed on Sundays). I opted for a cappuccino today and was happy with the result: the right strength and the right temperature. Service was friendly and efficient and the pricing was quite reasonable at around $4 (instead of the usual $5 at most other places). Good atmosphere in the cafe. Worth another visit

Came here after hearing lots of positive feedback about the coffee. I ordered a piccolo latte and couldn't help feeling that I was drinking a small cup of warm milk. The texture of the milk was excellent- perfect temperature and velvety, but I could hardly taste any coffee which made me sad. I'll give it another try some other time as maybe it was just a bad cup. The people who work here seem friendly and happy to be there.

located across the road from Sg General Hospital (Outram Park, I go here with colleagues. coffee is good, ambiance is young and they even conduct barista classes. prices are starbucks level but place has character. note: they are closed weekday evenings and have limited hrs on weekends

I have been visiting this place regularly in the last few years and it's amazing how the consistency and quality of the coffee has been maintained. Most refreshing coffee in Singapore at the cost of bragging I must say I do know my coffees. A must go to place even if it can be a little out of the way

I have to give special praise to Cedric, Phil and the team for once again taking great care of my aging Isomac. As well as making and roasting great coffee Highlander offer a coffee machine repair service and I must say that they've had mine in for servicing and repairs regularly since 2013. Polite, knowledgeable and efficient. It's all I want. Great service. Thanks.
