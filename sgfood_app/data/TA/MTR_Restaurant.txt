We have been going to MTR every week since it opened. We were never disappointed with food taste and quality. Try their masala dosa, vada and brewed coffee. With opening of adjacent wing, the waiting times have reduced significantly.
5
Do visit this authentic south indian restaurant to savour karnataka cuisine... Must try are masala dosa, crispy vada, akki rotti and rava idly
5
Great authentic food from Karnataka! Super tasty and fresh. Service is quick and good. Place is clean and always packed.
5
One of the best places to have authentic South Indian food. The food is always fresh and hot and the service always top notch.

Went for dinner with family (one baby also). Though we went close to closing time, they seated us very courteously. We ordered onion tomato uttapam, poori with potato curry (sagu as they call it), chapati, idli and set dosa. The sagu was watery (probably because of closing time) but quite tasty. Utappam was the best. Avoid set dosa. Better to order masala dosa with sagu. Good service and ambience. Baby was seated comfortably in a high chair. A nice eating place for Indians, especially from south India. Overall, a good experienc
5
One of the best place for amazing food...I have never had such an amazing dosa...The dosa is yummy and finger licking...I had the bisseballe bath which was very tasty.My daughter is very fond of eating dosa so I took her there with me and along with it I ordered the Ragi dosa which was too good..The quality and hygiene is very well taken care of at MTR.It is located at Serangoon road in Little India and very close to Kitchener Rd and Jalan Besar...I would suggest this is the best joint if someone is fond of south Indian food
5
The all-vegetarian variety is wide with dishes distinctive from one another with specific and delicious tastes, the service is prompt but not rushed, ordering is easy (it you're not certain about a dish, there is a full menu of pictures and descriptions). Grilling pancakes and frying other dishes is done with impeccable subtlety. Easy to locate, very near Ferrar Park MTR station. Every day they feature special dishes, so not everything is available all the time, but many choices remain. Closed Monday but other days serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Excellent value in every respect. The two of us ate well, including coffee, lassie, and four dishes, not to mention two desserts, for $S32, or about $US25

Though I had been to Singapore a few times and stayed in One Farrer Hotel, close to Little India, this was my first visit to MTR restaurant. Though I had visited MTR restaurants in Bangalore (including the original one opposite Lalbagh), and familiar with their obsession to quality/cleanliness, only on visiting this restaurant I came to know about the history of MTR and the key reasons for Rava Idli origination and packaging of ready made mixes, as part of their staple offering. There are detailed boards in the restaurant giving their history and the key events shaping the various business events of MTR. It would be worthwhile for any connoisseur to know these details to appreciate them.While entering the restaurant, you are welcomed by a queue, which is for making the upfront payment on choosing the menu and collecting the token (signboard), for the service at your chosen table. Though you can order any other item, from the table also, if would be preferable and efficient, if you can order at the entry stage only, to avoid delays. I had gone on a Tuesday, so it had on the day's special - Akki Roti and Madhur vada, 2 of my favourites, which I happily ordered. Both were original in taste, as if you are tasting them in Mysore/Bangalore. The filter coffee given there is out of the world, in terms of taste, and one of the best I have had in a long time. The crowd also is upmarket, compared to other south indian restaurants in Little India, as I had seen a Jewish family (with caps on their heads), a british group etc., and the sophistication of the service and the attire of the staff was good. The service is quite fast, compared to the milling crowd, which was their first day in the week. They are closed on Mondays. The rates charged are very reasonable for the quality of their food and the quantity they offer. It is also quite friendly from another standpoint, as from the car you can directly come in. I saw a wheelchair enabled descent from a family, who could come without any issue for food. Though I had in the outer hall my food on both the days I visited, I understand there is an inner hall as well. This is just opposite the Srinivasa Perumal temple, so it is easy to identify. Has everyday specialities, so can enquire and go

It’s rare that I would willingly choose to go to a vegetarian restaurant that didn’t serve alcohol for dinner, but the reviews were so good I thought we couldn’t stay in Little India and not visit. MTR didn’t disappoint, the food was very fresh, plentiful and full of flavour. It’s busy, so you may have to wait a bit, but it’s worth it
5
Wish they had more tables! You need to wait in a queue and breathe over others eating but its worth it! Just time yourself and avoid peak hours if your mission is to get a taste of authentic south Indian food. I love it that they stick to their time tested menu, don't unnecessarily experiment (no paneer dosas here) and have a proud heritage to lean on
5
MTR is a go-to place for excellent tasting, authentic south indian vegetarian food. The quality of the food has been consistently very good ; the service is also good. With the new space that has been added recently, it has been greatly enhanced.
5
Best restaurant to visit for south indian vegetarian food.
Cost is reasonable and service is also good.
They never compromise with taste it always tastes awesome.
5
Best Place for South Indian Food, must try Sagu Masala dosa, Rava Idli, Mangalore buns, Chandrahara and the list goes on.
Worth the money and staffs are polite
4
The King of South Indian Food was here too .. the food was awesome .. the ambiance is neat and so is the service ... Nice place to have your south Indian food ..
5
Excellent food out of Indian feeling like home. I have visit many other Indian restaurant in Singapore but i love this restaurant because of the mouth-watering food, excellent hospitality and cleanliness. Very convenient location adjacent to City Square Mall, Mustafa, and Little India. We tried almost everything on the menu during our last few visits and everything was delicious. Worth the wait if you see a line ........ a must try Masala Dosa and Bisibele Bath
5
The biggest issue was lack of place on peak hours but luckily that has been answered by larger space. The food is great and now they some new inclusions in the menu such as buns, mini idilli thove, onion pudi rava masala dosa. The staff are very courteous despite the rush. Always trying to serve with a smile. Surely safe place to eat and rest assured to keep your digestive tract in good order. One of the most hygienic Indian restaurant in Singapore serving good food with reasonable price tag.
5
MTR never fails to disappoint me when it comes to quick service and the quality of food. The staffs are always friendly and attentive. Every dish is to be savoured and relished. my favourite is their rasam vada, meals and filter coffee. would love to see them evolving in SG. Thanks MT
5
Very nice staff, the best part is now they have increased the sitting area. One can get seated and order at ease. Extremely child friendly. My 3 year old now passes smile to the staff lol. Coming to the food you can keep ordering and keep trying, every preparation is unique. Even after satisfying you cannot resist the temptation of ordering more
5
I am dining in this restaurant since it’s inception , my view is quality, quantity, taste hasn’t changed and of great standards. Staff are very friendly and helpful. They always welcome with smile. All items are my favourites, however the best is Rava Podi dosa which is better made than any restaurant in Singapore. I strongly recommend this restaurant for people who are looking for good, tasty food with unique items
1
My entire family have been patronising MTR since our Bangalore days in 1970s and 80s and hence were excited with it's launch in Singapore. Food quality and cleanliness is good but within months you could see the size of akki rotti, rava idle etc getting smaller by the day (wish I had taken photos to prove this statement). Even my daughter who would go there every tues for akki rotti stopped doing so, and now refuses even a take away from there. Why?A simple reason of charging her $2 for about 5 ml extra ghee when she asked for extra ghee. Their claim is "the ghee is from India"! Is MTR aware that many restaurants serve ghee from India and of excellent quality too, at no extra charge. Extra 'podi' at MTR will cost you $3. Ridiculous isnt it? You can get an entire bottle for that price. Again a lot of restaurants place Podi and pickle FOC on each table. Imagine if Italian cuisine starts charging for chillie flakes and parmesan cheese !Recently they have started a 'fine dining' section and as a result, the non- fine dining section pays the price for this. What was possible in the past now isn't. The operations manager must rethink his strategies. One must experience it to understand what I wish to share! best is to leave this suspense for you to find out and experience it too.In short, MTR lost 10 regular customers who have now vouched not to step into MTR, Singapore ever again 
5
We tried different dishes we have never eaten before and all was tasty. Really tasty veggie Indian food, fantastic value for money, good service. Highly recommended for all of the people who wants to try south Indian vegetarian food.
5
authentic udupi style restaurant ...clean ambience...feel home away home....Must Try Rava Idli , Vada, Bisi bele Bath, white Uppit , Pudi Dosa
5
A humble exterior hides the best South Indian cuisine I have tasted. Simply outstanding vegetarian food served by friendly and helpful staff. If I return to Singapore I will be go back
5
The food has always been excellent whenever we visit here.
It's a bit crowded during the evening, but with them extending next door it's better these days.
4
Very hygienic restaurant. The food in delicious and tasty. All made in ghee. The dosa was crunchy and masala was fresh. Polliogree rice were very nice and spicy must try. Coffee was okay. Must visit.
5
We visited this small, busy restaurant on two occasions during our holiday in Singapore. It brought back memories of the best vegetarian food we'd enjoyed in southern India: the complexity of the dishes, the fragrance, and the unique flavours. I really can't recommend this restaurant more highly.Our first meal was Sunday brunch - the restaurant was full and there was a queue. While waiting, we checked the menu and worked out our brunch menu as well as the dishes we'd order for dinner on a later occasion. Both meals were outstanding, and inexpensive.We'll definitely return when we're in Singapore again
3
I was asked by the manager to leave a review so here it is. I didn't think the food was up to much. May have just ordered the wrong thing but I didn't like it. I was looking forward to the usual South Indian food but got some dishes I wasn't familiar with and didn't enjoy.I think this place only has such a high rating as everyone is asked to leave a rating. There are plenty of other Indian and South Indian places just aroung the corner in the bustling streets, I am sure they are equally as good or better.Would I come back, no
5
We had this place recommended to us by friends and it was just fantastic. The place was so clean and pristine. The staff were very welcoming and gave us excellent recommendations from the menu. We haven’t eaten a lot of this style of Indian so the help was appreciated. The food came out in 5min hot and fresh and delicious. Everything was so flavoursome and made my mouth water. And the sweet lassi and mango lassi were excellent accompaniments to the meal. 10/10 would return there again and everyone who comes to Singapore should check it out at least once.
4
A bit dicey if you come in near the closing time as they close at 9.30 pm and stop accepting customers about 9 pm. We have visited twice in the last two months. On the first occasion, we were well in time and could get good wholesome food, tasty and delicious. The next time, we went in just before 9 pm, but got a bit of an indifferent experience, where the food was not upto the mark. The puffed puris were flat and when we asked for a replacement, were told that the dough had finished. So, you have been warned. Regarding food quality otherwise, it is quite acceptable, but I found that Murrugan restaurant just opposite Mustafa serves equally good if not better fare
5
We came to MTR for breakfast with a local friend who comes weekly and it exceeded our expectations. The pongal, vada, and dosas we ordered were spectacularly prepared. The dosa was probably the best dosa I’ve ever had, thick but crispy. And the prices are very affordable. Beyond that it was one of the cleanest fast food places I’ve been to. I’d highly recommend a visit.
4
The meals are delicious
You should try different beverages.
There is some queue but waiting time is very low.
The staff is very nice.
5
We are from the U.K. visiting Singapore and this place is a must if you like Indian food. We were staying in Little India and went here due to TA reviews and nothing matches it as we ate in a few local places during our stay. This is the best! The restaurant is full of locals so this is always a good sign. The staff are very welcoming and it is a very clean place - much cleaner than a number of others around here. The food is delicious and the waiter recommended various items to us. The quality of the food was excellent and very tasty. They do not serve alcohol but the lassi and other drinks were delicious. We had lots of food and the bill was excellent value for money.We would recommend to anyone.
3
We went to this restaurant because of its very high ranking on TripAdvisor. The visit was a bit disappointing. The food itself was certainly above average among the many South Indian restaurants in Singapore. The service needed to be improved:1. We felt very rushed while ordering the food. We were asked to queue at the cashier to order first before getting a table to sit down. The staff was impatient and wanted to get over with us quickly.2. Unsurprisingly the staff at the cashier made a mistake with our order and it took a very long time for the right thing to come.I wouldn't recommend this restaurant
5
Our family is southern Indian, born and raised, and we all agreed that this was one of the best South Indian meals we had ever had! Including different restaurants in south India and the famous MTR at Bangalore. Every dish was cooked to perfection with ghee and was simply delicious. We tried the pudi dosas (rava masala and masala), madhur vada, rava idli, mini-meal, khara bhath, kesari bhath, carrot halwa, badam halwa, and chandrahara. The informative plaques in the dining area are worth reading and accurately describe the great ethos of this restaurant. Service was prompt and friendly. Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for quality vegetarian food
4
Every time we visit Singapore we try to come eat as the quality and cleanliness is so good. Sadly this time we could only squeeze in a late breakfast of sorts having already enjoyed Appams elsewhere. ; )We were lucky enough to try two of their ‘signature’ dishes - Chow Chow Bhath for 6 S$Khara Bhath. A South Indian dish made by cooking dry roasted Semolina along with vegetables and grated coconut with Ghee. All topped with sliced tomato and served with chutney.Kesari Bhath. A sweet made from semolina,vermicelli,ghee,cashew nuts and raisins. Sprinkled with raisins. My wife had a sweet, hot milky almond drink that she loved. My coffee was fine but nothing special. Service was very friendly and polite as it always is.Note that some special dishes are only served on a certain day. Their website doesn’t appear to list this but you may be able to find some online. For instance Thursday and Sunday’s Neer Dosa served with jaggery, coconut and coconut chutney would be worthwhile tracking down
5
We came here on recommendation of friends. There was a long line on a Saturday for lunch, but the line moves pretty quickly. Ordered at the counter and then were promptly seated. Food came out very quickly and was piping hot. Flavors were amazing. Clean place and good for tourist and locals alike
5
My wife and I had an amazing dinner at MTR restaurant. As others have noted, MTR is very clean and the food is delicious. Next time we are in Singapore, MTR will definitely be at the top of our list of places to go for dinner.
5
Having come across MTR while strolling through Little India, I was a little skeptical because none of us are vegetarians but we stopped in anyway. When we had difficulty deciding what to order, the kind gentleman at the desk suggested several dishes for us all to share. Following his advice made all four of us very happy. I'd highly recommend MTR Restaurant
5
If you like South Indian vegetarian food - this is a place not to be missed in Singapore. And if you haven't tasted South Indian food its definitely worth trying. The food is authentic and really delicious. The podi dosa is to die for! We tried the pulliogare, bisibele bhath and the dahi vada. All delicious! The service was prompt and polite. The restaurant is simple and clean and almost always full! The good news is they have just expanded .. means shorter wait times :-
5
For the brief 20-30 mins that you’ll spend here, the place will transport you back to South India. The food tasted exactly like it does in Bangalore, the utensils and everything is the same. Good to visit if you’re craving Indian (which I was after a 2 week gap of no Indian food). Prepared to stand in a queue to first place your order and then find a table.
5
A very good South Indian restaurant in the heart of Little India, a prominent Indian locality in Singapore. It serves excellent south Indian food and is one of the best vegetarian restaurants in the area.
4
Food was super and the portions were bigger than I expected. Even if you’re not a vegetarian you won’t leave here hungry. If you’re longing for Indian food I’d definitely recommend this place.
4
Interesting place in the middle of Little India that looks more like a cantina than a restaurant. Cheap prices and vegetarian savory food. 4 out of 5. Definitely. Worth to visit.
5
I am eating in this place almost every Thursday with family , friends , solo. It’s almost like to do thing for me on Thursday. Highlights are best crispy Rava dosa , rava idly , Podi dosa and what not. I love this place 😀
5
For authentic south Indian cuisine look nowhere else ! Very polite & courteous staff and management !
3
We ordered Thosai; masala Thosai n Poori. The food were not too bad, but have eaten similar things elsewhere, which taste better n bigger portion
5
MTR is a special place for people from India and, especially, South India. There are several restaurants in Singapore that serve South Indian "snacky" fare but only one that combines excellent food with great authenticity and exceptional service. No element of the food seems like "they didn't get this quite right"; they get every element of their fare right all the time. I have been a hugely loyal patron of this restaurant and am an unabashed fan
5
This was our favourite Indian restaurant in all of Singapore. Neither of us are vegetarians but we left this restaurant feeling happy and full. You order and pay when you first enter. An older man behind the main desk that day was very helpful and provided some terrific recommendations. The food tasted very authentic and there was a mix of diners. There was a line out the door but we got seated pretty quickly
5
This is easy to find. Serangoon is a main street in Little India. There is a subway stop nearby with a name like Ferrar. We walked from a different subway stop at #1 to #438, so we saw a lot of Little India. It is vegetarian, and it all tasted good. They cut some of our dishes into thirds to make it easy for the three of us. They gave us good service. Our meal of six dishes cost SG$29 including 7% tax
5
I enjoy this Mavalli Tiffin Rooms (MTR) so much that I bring my friends here (especially if they enjoy Vegetarian food) whenever I'm in the neighbourhood to show them a side of Indian cuisine they have never known. It's a small room so be warned of long queues on weekday mealtimes/weekends - it'll be wise to visit off peak hours so you can take your time, order fewer dishes and top up as you go along if you're still hungry. Check out their specialities: Rava Idli, Bisibele Bhath, Kharabhath ... and many more items seldom seen in Indian menus. The prices might appear a little steep but believe me, everything tastes as good as it looks
4
Was good nothing crazy. Nothing out of the ordinary. Would recommend to go back again. Good prices tasted good.
5
The best thing I ever had in Sinagpore is that just amazing
Good vegetarian food and it's totally worth the money. The taste is authentic South Indian
5
Being a Bangalorean, this was the first place I visited after moving to Singapore. I regularly go here whenever I have cravings for Bangalore style food. The ambience reminds me of home. Will definitely keep coming back.
4
One of the oldest restaurants in Karnataka opened a branch in Singapore. The taste is awesome and quality has been kept intact.
5
Bad an excellent Indian Meal here. Very suitable and recommendable for vegetarians. Will return soon.
4
This is a place for most of the Indian Food lovers .. but every time i used to pay for the dosa i was like :: damn i can buy 5 dosas in India .. and seriously i mean it .. Its cheap as per Singapore ,, the food is decent quality and they have lots and lots of varieties .. i prefer dosa and nothing else ..
5
MTR has been our favorite go to place for some lip smacking dosa, idli, poori sagu, filter coffee and much more.Have been visiting it since past 3 years and the consistency of taste is unbelievable.The staff is courteous and attentive.To many more visits and to many more amazing south indian fare
5
The food is so amazing but it is so cramped I have no clue why they do not expand to a bigger place where they can be a bit more organised. Their puliogare, vangi bath, masala dosa and rava idlis are my favourite and a must try
5
What a delightful surprise to find this vegetarian Indian restaurant on Serangoon Road! This place has the most delicious plain dosa I’ve ever had in my life. It’s crisp on the outside & slightly thicker than a paper dosa & has a minty paste in the middle that is sublime. Even my mum, who doesn’t usually like mint flavoured food was completely a fan of this dosa. We will definitely be back to try some of their other items on offer
4
Went for a weekday lunch. Food is still good. Pity they have removed normal Thalis during weekdays - have only mini Thali as was looking forward to pen. Email need up ordering alternative. Service still prompt unless you order Dosa which take a long time. Prices very reasonable though expensive compared to other cheap places in Serangoon - difference worth the cleanliness etc.
5
Try once. you will remember the food, again and again, One of the best restaurants in Singapore. You may see the regular item but tastes you magnificent.
5 out of 5.
5
It’s good a few new stuff have been added on the menu. Thove idilli - healthy n great. As usual friendly staff n easy on your pocket.
5
Love the masala dosa, Khara bath and the coffee. Definitely the best breakfast place .. never disappointed in the last 10 occasions...
4
This is a small restaurant that was very busy when we visited. There were quite a lot of people waiting for seats and so it was a pleasant surprise that, having ordered, we were shown to a table within a few minutes. The food comes as it is prepared and everything looked good. Our dishes were very tasty. The restaurant is very clean, the service is good. And it is very good value for money
4
We went to MTR in little India during our visit to Singapore... to all those who have already been to MTR in India I am sure you will go with a expectation. MTR Singapore does not disappoint you though cannot match Bengaluru. Rice items are better than the tiffins. Reasonably priced but very very cramped seating arrangement.If you are in Singapore and must eat Indian then I will recommend MTR over others.
5
I am a huge fan of this place..so much so that I visit this place at least thrice a week. The food quality, staff service is unmatchable. Do try their signature bisi bele bath.i bet you won't regret your decision to have this dish. I only got to say one thing. If you are in Singapore DO PAY A VISIT !!
3
I went to MTR after a few months as I was visiting family in India over the summer but was shocked to see how average the food has become. The dosa wasn't well done, it wasn't crispy and was unnecessarily thick. To add, the sambar was also not as good as earlier. Now I'm in the hunt for a good south Indian eatery again :
5
Located in the heart of Singapore's bustling Little India district, this restuarant has certainly earned the Trip Advisor accolades displayed in its front window. The entire dining experience ran incredibly smoothly and our dinner was served at record speeds after we placed our order and paid at the front counter. Everything was delicious and the portions were good value for money, while the staff were friendly and prompt with their table service. Boasting great service and numerous dishes bursting with flavour, one visit was enough to see why this charming restuarant is a favourite among both tourists and locals alike!
4
They deserve their claim of being no.1 Indian veg restaurant in Singapore as they did serve very good vegetarian dishes. We specially liked their Set Dosa and Thali lunch.Place is neat and clean but again a very unusual practice of place order and pay first on the counter and then sit inside and have your meal delivered, you can add more items later and then again pay for the same separately. No idea why they follow such model but the food quality and quantity is adequate. Little expensive as compared to other south Indian restaurants in the vicinity
5
I've stayed in Bangalore for almost 4 years and I am a big fan of MTR Bangalore. When I visited Singapore and came to know about MTR Singapore, I cannot resist myself going there. And my decision was good!Dosa, idli, pongal, tea and cofee - It reminded me of my old Bangalore days of finger-licking authentic dosa
3
Come in. Place your order at the door and sit down. Very high turnover traffic during lunch time. Classic Indian vegetarian food - very simple. So it all depends if you like the food. A lot of carbo
2
Been for lunch waited one hour. Had special meals yes lots of different items other than that the taste and quality is the same if not poorer than regular South Indian restaurants. Worth one visit for the name.
5
Very authentic food, you must try Masala dosa or position masala dosa and the famous MTR bissibili bath(make sure you go slightly earlier)
3
Have been coming to MTR for the last 2 years. It was so good earlier that I am surprised with the quality now. Ordered Rava Idli and Masala Dosa. Idli was fine, but Dosa's Sambhar was powdery, as if from a sambhar mix. It had no vegetables in it and had a darker colour. the Dosa batter was also thicker than usual, the finesse from the past was lacking.
4
Went here for lunch today the set menu is $8 and it's delicious You place your order when you walk in and the food comes quickly It's a franchise but they certainly know how to do it lots of locals love this place close to one farrer hotel Highly recommend this eating place They also educate you with a run down of dishes on a screen with ingredients and details of each food item great idea when your not familiar with the menu and the food
4
The food is great (no surprises there). The rates are reasonable. The ambience is welcoming. With the same place expansion planned, it is expected that wait time would reduce further. What do you really write about an iconic brand like MTR. It will always be there in your preferences and you would not be disappointed. The vehicle can be parked either outside on the road or in the Mandir parking across the road. Enjo
4
I found some interesting items on the menu e.g Ragi dosas, wheat flour dosas..and the food we ordered hit all the right spots.It’s a small restaurant so go there early to beat the lunch and dinner rush or be prepared to wait. But service is fast and efficient. I would definitely visit again
5
ok i am surprised why some people have given this place a poor review. food here is authentic south indian and amazingly well made. the pudi dosa is a must try.the other dishes also were pretty well made and were infact better than the south indian places in mumbai.all in all a must try. we had 2 meals over here and couldnt have enough.will definately recommend
5
Whilst walking around Little India and after reading previous reviews decided on MTR. Got there and didn’t realise it was vegetarian, we all sat for a moment and thought do we stay or go as I really felt like Masala and Butter chicken, decided to stay. Ordered about 7 different dishes had no idea on some of them, OMG what an awesome lunch the food was amazing & the flavours and staff absolutely lovely in helping us.
4
I have been to MTR Bangalore and was looking for a change from the standard bhavans that you get in Singapore. So had to go to MTR Singapore.Very authentic food. Amazing sambar. Like the dosas, ponggal, bishibela bhat etc. Have tried quite a few dishes and visit it frequently
5
Really tasty veggie Indian food, fantastic value for money, good service- I would definitely recommend.
5
Wow.... Amazed with the authentic taste and quality of the food served...
Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for the food to be served on the table... But it is worth the wait...
Highly recommended in Singapore
5
We could happily eat this food every day. We only wanted one course each with a soft drink and the bill came to less than 2 coffees at our hotel round the corner. Delicious.
4
We had no real idea what the dishes would be like so went with the specials of the day and we were not disappointed.
Food was excellent.
This is not about ambience and relaxed atmosphere
It is good food served quickly and good value.
5
Had a simple vegetarian lunch but the quality of the food was excellent the service was great and the prices were reasonable. The place was also very clean. Definitely a must visit if you like Indian food
5
We were a family of 7 and stayed in a new hotel very close to Farrer Park MRT. Out of all the restaurants in that area (which includes Little India and Farrer Park), we were 100% satisfied only with this restaurant. The place was very near to access, the food was extremely hygienic and tasty and the service the very very prompt. All the staff members were very friendly and courteous.I highly recommend this restaurant to whomsoever visiting Singapore
5
We were staying in Little India and decided to dine here the final night of our time in Singapore and it was sensational.Busy at 7pm ipwhen we arrived and we were guided what would be suitable for our four kids who are not too adventurous when it comes to eating.The flavors were superb and everything we were recommended were a hit with the kids and us. I come to Singapore regularly and this is definitely a “do again”place to eat
4
Inspired by Channel 5 TV food hunt show, I followed the trail to this vegatarian restaurant for breakfast the next morning.Ordered the same masala dosa and filtered coffee as the host. The dosa is large and thick but crispy with filling of my favourite spiced potatoes. Dosa is a pancake made from platter or rice and black lentils glazed with ghee. The dish is seved with 2 types of sauces and I prefer the green veggie sauce over the other spicy sauce which may over mask the already spicy fillings.The coffee is unique, by topping with a thick layer of steamed foam that somehow adds volume to the coffee taste. I enjoyed it although I am not really a kopi-o drinker.This is the best time to visit Serangoon Road as the roads are decorated for the Deepavali festival
4
Went to MTR for breakfast. Loved it!I have spent quite a bit of time in South India and MTR did not disappoint. Great masala dosa and great filter coffee. It is lively and noisy and lot's of families there with kids. Order as you go in and grab a table. Get there early for breakfast as it's quite busy.
5
This is an authentic place based on my friends who live in Singapore. The only challenge is that it gets very packed at mealtimes (12 - 2 ) during lunch especially on weekends. I went there on my last trip to Singapore and the food is amazing but the chaos is something to take a deep breath for. Still worth it, must go
5
Had a great lunch with my colleagues. The service is fast, food is great, place is clean!
The place gets busy during lunch times - good thin my friend called 10mins before arriving and table was reserved for us.
4
Fabulous restaurant. Authentic Karnataka taste. My Favourite item is Uddin Vada and it is so crispy and fresh.
5
It's the best South Indian cuisine restaurant in Singapore. Must must eat Tamarind rice and Podi Masala dosa. Clean Hygienic restaurant
4
Had the waiter select a few dishes for us including breads.
Food was really good and service was friendly and efficient. All meals are priced well and the place is full of locals which is a great sign.
5
It's a paradise for south indian food lovers. I love their pudi masala dosa the most. The ingredients are absolutely fresh and one can make out from the aroma.Restraunt is located near the Farrer park mrt station. 100 mtrs walk.Seating capacity is on the lower side with respect to the amount of crowds it pulls.The filter coffee here is fab.

Small, but hospitable restaurant in Singapore's Little India. I've visited its branches in Dubai & Bangalore; however, nothing like the one in Singapore. Generally crowded in the evenings; so they take orders & give you a token number as soon as you enter. By the time you get a table to sit (its a first-come-first-basis), your food is ready to be served
4
Decided to visit MTR after reading so much. Overall the food is great. Its superb, tasty. Different. It does not disappoint . BUT,,why the BUT.It lack on the experience part. for me as an Indian whose used to eating lots of south indian food, there are certain expectations that add to exp. for eg : I do not like a restaurant putting messages like "extra sambhar, chutney 'etc will be charged extra. Thats stingy attitude. also your portion of these condiments are so small that they are barely sufficient. and these are sides, how much would a customer really east extra. aldo part of the experience is about getting the food served with the "podi" with ghee. That an expectation from MTR as brand. It adds to experience. for that too, charge etc.Well you are charging good amount, serving great food, need to make it a great experience. Or maybe just not interested because there is no dearth of customers.so will I go there again, yeah sure, the food is good, hands down. so for that yes. but very frequently, probably no
4
Great Indian food but very dry. No saucy curries. We enjoyed what we had and it is obviously popular as it was packed! Heavy turnover of people as well. I was looking forward to a saucy vegetable curry but ended up with a lot of dry food. All was really tasty. Probably my fault as I didn't know what to expect. Order on entry then find a table to sit down. Free water with tin cups and jugs.
5
We visited here last Saturday morning as a group of 10.The staff made us feel welcome and seated all of us immediately. The food was excellent and of very high quality. I could tell the ingredients were very good. It's so nice to go to a restaurant that cares about the quality of their food.We will be back. Thank yo

Visited for the first time and ordered a Masala Dosa (must have had 100's of these over the years), was thinking how different can it be - was totally surprised and blown away, the masala dosa was super crisp from outside but soft from inside, with a tangy chutney coating inside which gave it a completely different flavor. Waiting to go again. Only downside is that you are asked to order before you sit and with a line waiting behind you need to be fast (out goes multiple courses), I guess that's the only way they can make most of a small space they operate out off
4
The food in MTR 1924 in Singapore is good compared to other similar restaurants in that area. The taste of Original place in Bangalore is not comparable.Lot of improvement is required.
5
Ok a lazy afternoon one of the best things is a lovely South Indian meal and a chilled mango lassi from MTR.
5
Good food, fast service, overall great experience ! Very pleasant experience, highly recommended for South Indian food

So much crowd in the restaurant and wanted to try only to be utterly disappointed. Had lunch, every little thing except the payasam was spicy and in the mood to finish fast such spicy food, I finally forgot the payasam also. Instead of curd they give curd rice and the portion is so little even the Prasadam from temples are much more, wonder they charge $8 and absolutely no value for money when one can get better meals in nearby Ananda Bhavan or Lakshmi Narayana restaurants. This is the first and will be my last visit to MTR, but their business is thriving with so much tourists and mostly also North Indian crowd, wonder how they eat such spicy food in so much volumes of people. I would have given one star but for the neatness of the place and food
5
After walking down the streets of Little India for about 30 mins, finally I found this famous and most popular hub for the best South Indian food in Singapore and all my walking was fruitful. The restaurant is worth a visit if u are in singapore and when u are craving to get the taste of South India. They serve the most fresh food and the entire working team is very cordial. Had a Vada and Dosa which were tasty. The way they have carried on the business since its initial days is really inspiring.
5
Wanted to go back to my bengaluru bachelor days for a nice breakie! Had nice rava idli and pudi uppit! Even after so many decades, this joint of MTR brings memories back of its 1st joint @lalbagh road...great place for variety of vegetarian options Karnataka style. Bisi bele baath, dosas and filter coffee must haves other than rava idlis. Very filling and always great quality and consistency in preparation.
4
Went on a Saturday morning for breakfast had to wait long to be seated. Excellent South Indian food .Efficient seating system.Good ambience ,clean Had Idli ,Vada and poori. Well balanced spices.South India filter coffee was excellent. has maintained the excellent standard since my last visit about 18 months ago . Overall as good as any South Indian vegetarian restaurant in Indi
5
This review comes rather late, I have been there multiple times during my stay in Singapore. It is simply the best Vegetarian Restaurant in Singapore. Every dish of there's is super delicious and the service is quick. If you are looking for veg food in Singapore, look no further, MTR is the place to go
5
Everything we ate here was top notch! So much flavour and great value for money. Really clean restaurant as well which doesn't come by easily in little India. Great service to top it off. Not surprised they have gained such excellent reviews.You won't be disappointed!
5
Was looking for a nice, reasonably priced Indian restaurant, and was blown away by how good this place was. In a relative expensive city, this place offers amazing quality food for really low prices. Service was very good, food was excellent - would recommend it to anyone looking for good Indian food, regardless of your budget
4
Had a very nice vegetarian dinner, love the flavors and the choice of food. Especially the curry plates. Will come back to have some more soon.
5
Very popular for locals and that says a lot!!! We tried different dishes we have never eaten before and all was very very tasty. We like indian foot a lot. Friendly staff helped to select. Everyone who is around should go for it!!!
5
Excellent food if you like south indian traditional food.Must try kara bath & Akki rotti. Most of all excellent food quality.
5
very popular with indian expats which probably says a lot about the food here. food is consistently good and place is clean.
4
It's a very popular place so expect it to be crowded. We were a group of 6 and ordered various dishes like Masala Dosa, Poori, Kara bath, Neer Dosa and coffee. The food was excellent and service was good.
5
Very nice south Indian breakfast. Fast and attentive service and good quality of food. Also reasonably priced.
5
Had eaten at their main restaurant in Banglore in 1977. Visited their Singapore branch. Had teh best south indian food. Excellent choices on the menu. They have everyday specials and over the weekend. Very clean compared to other restaurants offering similar menu. Unfortunately closed on Monday
4
I wasn't wanting for vegetarian but was very happy I sought out MTR is Little India. Authentic curries and breads stuffed with all good things, such as potato and onion. Popular with the locals too, so you know you are into a good thing. Do try it! If it's veggie curry in a hurry you're after, you won't be disappointed.
5
Located opposite an Indian temple on Serangoon road, is one of the TOP places for traditional vegetarian food.The tastes are unlike of the other more popular southern Indian cuisines restaurants in the vicinity.I have found the restaurant always crowded but the food quality is impeccable. A must visit
5
We were visiting Singapore from Canada and my wife and I were in the mood for Indian food for breakfast. We chose this place in Little India because of the reviews and were not disappointed. Very inexpensive (relative to everything else in Singapore) and quite different from what we have in Toronto. Will definitely be back as there were many choices for breakfast and we couldn't try them all! The filtered coffee is also a must try
3
I wont overstate it but had comparable taste with some other veg restaurants. Nothing special. Weekends are crowded
4
Quality is excellent like MTR in Bangalore. But serving sizes are small and, being Singapore, it is overpriced. Also, a small outlet and generally crowded at meal times, especially weekends. Expect to wait outside. Not a great place for a long catch up with friends.
5
Have a vegetarian 14 year old who chose this restaurant based on reviews - food was amazing , even for the rest of the family who balk without meat. Highly recommended !
5
The food of this restaurant reminds me of the hotel back in Bangalore. They have really good food at good prices . The people at the restaurant are very nice and friendly as well.
5
... and the art of eating with 2 spoons. They have unique items on the menu that you don't find in other Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. All well made, fresh and taste good. A little on the spicy side.
4
Had heard a lot about MTR from friends and found my first experience interesting! As expected for a meals/tiffin joint the place was set up modestly. The service quick and efficient and geared to make it quick in and out for customers!The place is functional and not a place to go to for ambience or for a relaxed setting.What makes up for everything is the genuinely good food. I personally had limited myself to tiffin items and they were great. Genuine south India food and not some adapted or modified menu to suit all!
4
Taste wise it's the best you can get, just like the original MTR from Bangalore. The place is clean and well kept even after 3 years of opening. We visit this place almost every month. Service is quick Slightly costlier than the other South Indian restaurants around, but its completely worth it. Masala dosa, idli, onion uttapam, onion rava dosa are few of my favourites followed by nice filter coffee. Avoid the gulab jamun , it's aweful Only thing is that they are short of space and place is overcrowded, almost, always (which may be a good problem to have)Overall, very goo
4
Had rava idli , onion Uttapa , chow chow bhath , sp thali , Chandrahar All was good Accompaniments: sambhar , chutneys all were pasty powder like dint go well so left it Good for vegetarians Need to place order and pay at counter before proceeding to seat which is Not self explanatory Service is okPrice averageWould visit again
5
Came here for dinner with both of my parents, who were a little conflicted over the full-vegetarian menu. Needless to say, it was some of the best Indian food we have ever had (& we have had lots!!). Quick service and very cheap - the three of us spent around $35 in total. Friendly service and lovely atmosphere. Highly recommend!
5
Mavalli Tiffin Room as it is otherwise known provides authentic south Indian delicacies in a totally affordable range. Those who are not from India should know that, the four corners of the country North-South-East-West has completely different cuisines, different in taste, seasoning, plating in every possible way. Me being an East Indian found the curd rice, bisebele bhath, dahi vada and poori dosa mouth watering! Not to forget the filter coffee which is typical of South India. Loved their budget mini meals and definitely looking forward to visit again
4
Authentic Taste.. Nice Variety... Special Menu everyday, service is fast, Restaurant is clean, and at prominent location in little india...
4
The food is awesome...very tasty and authentic. Service is fast. The restaurant is always crowded as it's very popular with both locals and tourists.
4
Had thosai pulliagroe and idli. All awesome. Big q to start but moved reasonably fast. Dishes were incredibly consistent and delicious. Also had bru coffee which was as expected. Only problem was that the coffees took 25 mins!!
5
Its an amazing place for south Indian breakfast, highly recommended for all of the people who wants to try south Indian food and who is far from home. Its one of my favorite place and they never disappoint me.
5
By far the best South Indian food in Singapore...food quality and service was excellent. Kids enjoyed the food.
5
Small restaurant very short walk from MRT station at farrier park. Very good food and very quick service and cheap with most meals aroun $ 5.00 If you had to wait it would not be long as turnover is fast. Our night was early and quiet with mainly local families eating which is always a good sign. You do have to pay before you eat and If anything being westners we over ordered the amount of food as it was hard to judge the size of plates. If I had the time in Singapore I would go back as so much I wanted to try.and I will reorder if wanting more
4
One has to stand in Q and place the order at the entrance (including payment) before going to the table. So we had to review the menu standing in a group to place our first order - quite a challenge if you are in a large group. Surprisingly, the second round of orders can be placed from your table and the bill paid on your way out. It would be great if they could take the orders at the table like a normal restaurant.The dosa was ok while the idly wada was good. Avoid pongal as they don't know how to make it. Overall, nice place to drop in for breakfast. The nice part is that it is on the main road and just adjacent to the bust stop
5
The restaurant was visited on two occasions and we even tried for a third time but the line of guests in waiting stretched to the pavement. There is a good reason for this. As newbies to Indian vegetarian food we were well advised by the employees. The dishes arrived quickly and were just delicious. The signature dish ”Masala dosa” is especially recommended. Food like this could ease the transformation to a vegetarian. In addition, the meal came with an acceptable price
5
I visited this place on 27th June 2017 with my husband for breakfast. We had ordered rava idli, Onion rava dosa, vada sambhar, ragi dosa and filter coffee. Rava dosa n ragi dosa were crisp and made in ghee. Rava idli with sagu was yummy. The medu vada was crisp and the sambhar just perfect. The filter coffee was just right.The breakfast made my day. A complete vegetarian south Indian delight to my palate.The restaurant was clean and ambience so much better than the other restraunts in little India.The soothing carnatic music played in the background. Courteous service.The best part was they accepted master travel card..which made it easier for tourist me to payWould recommend this place to all...
5
Heard a lot about this place and it didn't disappoint -- was blown away by the variety of idly, thosai, vada, and bhaths (cooked rice)... I loved the thosai - really fresh and crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Best to come with a group so that you can share and try more dishes. The price is also very reasonable - expect to spend less than $15 per head including beverages and side dishes. Service was prompt and brisk as many people were waiting for tables! We were in a huge group of 18 and the boss/manager of the place was nevertheless very accommodating
5
There's not much to add beyond the other reviews, but it really is excellent South Indian food! The vadais, especially, are just as they should be.
5
Phenomenal service, the staff couldn't be nicer. I ordered an onion rava masala dosa, and it was beyond excellent. Authentic Vegetarian South Indian Cuisine at its finest!
4
The food is good but have in mind it is a vegetarian restaurant. The waiters are really nice and they recommend different plates depending on what you like.
5
when a place is packed with locals then you know that you should try, the service was quick, the food is great and the staff are helpful
5
Went for a lunch after strolling in around Little India - Mustafa Market. Perfect exact MTR authentic tastes. Quick service and prompt refills. Must visit if you fancy South Indian Cuisine.
4
We were staying around the corner from this restaurant. I think we were the only tourists eating there. The food was delicious and the service was great. Next time I'm back in Singapore I will be going to MTR to eat again.
5
We went with our friends for lunch, and the queue says it all why it's the best place to have some south indian delicacies. We ordered multiple food items from menu marked as special for the day and everything was awesome in taste. Tip: try their MTR Special Thali and Kesaribath as desert. Will go back again and will surely recommend to who are looking for best south indian food.
5
We go to MTR before our normal Mustafa vists and usually for breakfast. It opens at 8:30 but few people are always waiting before by 8:25am for it to open. It gets packed very quickly too! Everything we try each time is always hot and yummy
5
Best dosas in Singapore. They use ghee and organic rice for batter. The preparation is done on light flame which makes the dosas crispy from outside and soft inside. I am already a fan of this Kannada style preparation. Attention to details is amazing and the service is really good
5
We were very excited to stumble across this restaurant in Little India. It is definitely popular with the locals so you may need to queue, but it's worth it. The chutneys were full of flavour and the lassi had that perfect combination of salt and sweet and cold that you need for a humid day in Singapore.
5
Stumbled across this little eatery and was totally intrigued. Super friendly and efficient staff, amazing food in terms of texture and flavour.... Will definitely go back to try other items. Really good!!!
5
Delicious South Indian Food at MTR. Better than In India. Space is less and so crowed. All dishes are food and worth trying. I enjoyed the food
5
Crowded but service is excellent .. you get table within 5 minutes. Specially Thali in lunch is awesome on Sunday..
4
Great vegetarian food at MTR. Went several times and enjoyed. However, took our (visiting) grandchildren along one time, and the kids found it difficult as they do have a limited menu compared to some of the other restaurants in Little India.
5
The same taste which we get in Bangalore but with more cleanliness and more friendly staff.. An amazing dosa and idli awaited In Singapore for all the South Indian foodies. A perfect place for a getaway and still feel at home..
4
and it was. Came on a Friday night. Restaurant was packed with families, friends, co-workers out on a Friday night dinner.....Constant stream of diners made us feel good about our dinner choice. Did I mention this is my first Indian vegetarian restaurant visit ? Menu has pictures for the uninitiated (like us). We had mango lassi (but of course), khali dosa (rice and lentil pancakes), veg pulav and button idly sambar. Very delicious...didn't miss the meat at all :) Place is clean; service very friendly and efficient
4
I am not usually drawn to fast food places that have huge banners shouting 'authentic' etc. The overwhelming desire to have a good Masala Dosa got me.. we were greeted warmly and offered a table fairly quickly, given the need to queue up for a table .. if you see a long queue of locals at a food outlet in Singapore.. join it!The Masala Dosas were fresh and tasty, staff including their friendly cleaning lady approached us to ask if were were enjoying our meal .. it is this type of caring hospitality that makes a difference .. well worth dropping by
4
Excellent restaurant with a wide variety of vegetarian items of the Udupi- Karnataka Style. Masale Dose, Idli- Vade Sambar, Curd Vade, Lunch with the Tomato Saaru are all great! The Badam halva is a nice desert. The only two reasons I rate them 4 is1. The place is limited and hence gets crowded quickly - leading to ~20mins of wait time2. It is towards the other end of the Serangoon Road near Mustafa Center Still it is a place I'd visit every time I go to Singapor
5
The MTR Restaurant on Serangoon Rd. is the best place for South Indian staple food like dosa and idli. The service is extremely accommodating and impeccably efficient. We brought our family of 8 and the staff there was happy to take care of us all. Not to mention the food is delicious.
5
I stepped into this restaurant and was surprised to see the line up. Luckily people were seated pretty fast. Our meal was delicious and the staff was very friendly. Highly recommend this place. You may want to come a little early or after the lunch crowd
5
The food its great and fresh. The service is efficient and the food is definitely worth the price !!
4
Though it was a quick meal but managed to try a couple of dishes and loved the authentic taste of Idli, dosa and sambhar. I will go back to try out other dishes.
5
Superb food excellent quality try their signature dishes even thali is really filling and good don't miss out filter coffee set meals lemon rice etc it's like having food in sophisticated india
5
Every item on the menu tastes amazing especially the Dosas. If you are visiting MTR SG for the first time, don't forget to try Pudi Masala Dosa. I feel the MTR is Singapore is better than the ones in Bangalore sometimes.. ;)
5
The brand carries the name. A authentic South Indian tasty food. Heritage of Karnataka in Singapore.
5
Nice clean and tasty food. Had thali for lunch along with South Indian filter coffee. All dishes well balance, poories were light and flaky made from whole wheat.
5
MTR offers very good South Indian Tiffins.Must try dishes are Bisibelabath & Rava Dosa.
Special South Indian thali is also very nice.
5
MTR lives upto its reputation as one of the top veg options for indian travellers. The bisibele bath is my top pick there. Crowded at peak times but worth the wait.All the dishes are excellent. Closed on mondays.
5
Simply love the food here...Medu vada, rava idli, poori saagu, kaali dosa, plain dosa (different from the typical plain dosas you get at other South Indian restaurants). Have tried most of the dishes and many more yet to be tried.. even their tea and coffee have amazing flavors and is very refreshing..it's always served hot after your meals are completed, unless you specify you want to have it along with your meal..Weekend mornings are a bit crowded but it's worth the wait..Service is quick and efficient..A good breakfast is always a great start for the day!
4
Of singapore restaurants. True the food here is different from your run of the mill dosa or dosai (as we say in Singapore) place. The menu is not extensive but they serve quality stuff. Everything is freshly made and tastes good . The choice really is between a few types of dosas some vada versions and a few rice dishes. The service is great and the place is clean and hygenic. Certainly one of the better South Indian restaurants but top 10 is singapore?? No way!
5
Went with family for a lunch on a Saturday . Ravi dosa, pudi dosa without masala n filter coffee were excellent. Not to be missed. 12 noon is good time to get table. Beyond that first come first serve.
4
Has authentic south Indian cuisine. No change in taste as compared to MTR outlets bangalore. One point less for not so good tea.
4
I'm not the biggest fan of vegetarian but even I found the food here delicious. Just be aware that you need to order and pay at the counter and the front rather than order from a waiter. Prices very reasonable.
5
Excellent taste .. genuine south Indian restaurant ... A bit crowded in the evening due to small space but worth the wait ... Try their recommended items... Originality presented well.. a must try ..
5
We had a lunch here and it was fabulous. It's vegetarian but as a meat lover I wasn't disappointed at all. Everything was tasty and full of flavors. The setting is rather basic but the taste of the food was not.
5
Stayed 7 nights in Little India and we went here for 5 of those mornings for breakfast. The food was yummy. If you want traditional South Indian food, give it a try. My boys are hooked, and I will be back again.
Thanks MTR 😃
5
Outstanding vegetarian Indian cuisine. The space is bare and no frills but it's all in the taste! Very good flavors and excellent speed of service
5
My family & I have been to MTR on multiple occasions & have only been delighted by the fabulous food at MTR. The service is very quick, the food quality excellent & the attendants are courteous. It is a place to grab a quick & yummy bite so not a place when you want a fine dining experience but definitely one that you would like to go to delight your taste buds. For anyone who even remotely likes south indian food, this place is a must try!
5
We went here based on the tripadvisor reviews and we weren't disappointed. It was extremely busy and the ordering system was a bit confusing. Not sure if we were supposed to line up and order or whether it was table service. There seemed to be a bit of both happening. In any case, we were looked after by a lovely gentleman and the meal arrived quickly and was absolutely delicious! It was also great value for money. I was dreaming about this meal for days afterwards and only wished we had more time in Singapore so that we could've gone back again
5
If you are looking for authentic South Indian food, then no need to look beyond MTR. It's as authentic as it gets. The taste, the ambience, the ingredients - all excellent. My favourite is the plain dosa, rava idli, bisi belle rice - pretty much everything on the menu is worth coming again and again. The services is courteous and prompt. It's a busy place, so be prepared to wait - but they are efficient, so you wont have to wait long - and the wait will be well worth it
5
The food is awesome at MTR. Specially their rava idly and podi dosa. Coffee is good and so is the badam milk shake.
Beware of over crowding and Long queues during peak hours.
4
Almost all South Indian tiffin items are available. Except their 'pongal' everything tastes good. Especially the aromatic coffee. The waiters can behave pleasantly to the customers. The way they serve can be a little polite and pleasant.
5
Small place, but clean & efficient service. Probably the best southindian tiffin joint in Singapore. We also tried the place next door but it was average at best.
This place is much better than even then lots of south indian eats in Mumbai.
5
Amazing Indian food. Wonderful flavours, generous helpings. You truly can't go wrong here.
As a western person I really like the dosa masala and bisibele bhath.
But the set meal is a steal at 12 dollars, as you get a bit of everything!
4
We visited this restaurant in April 2017 and found the quality exactly in line with the original MTR restaurant in Bangalore. The authenticity of cuisine, presentation and the taste were outstanding. Doing this in Singapore speaks volumes about the processes implemented by the hotel chain. Only improvement can be to add more space to make the place bigger to ensure easy availability of tables to guests. Keep it up !
5
With a legacy as long as MTR has since 1924 and the culinary advances that have been incorporated over the years by its founders, it is no surprise that the outlet in SG serves up a plethora of South Indian vegetarian delicacies at a quality that is hard to beat. The age old saying of 'You get what you pay for', is so true at MTR. Every dish is freshly prepared and the quality and cleanliness of this outlet is commendable. Having created a tradition of eating my weekly 'rava dosa' on Saturday evenings with my dear friend Ravi, it was only fair to bring the family into the fold. And that is exactly what happened this past weekend. The results are always outstanding and predictable. MTR is a great place to savour one's South Indian vegetarian delicacies and I highly recommend it over many other options available in Singapore. Enjoy this culinary journey! You won't be disappointed
5
Located opposite to Sri Perumal Temple, This is the most authentic South Indian food available in Singapore. Most Indian Restaurants offer Indian like Food, but MTR matches the same taste, quality and service of the MTR Restaurants in India. The service is great and quick, you get some very very good food here. Always ensure you keep some time for waiting as it is always full. You must try the vada, masala dosa, meals etc here
5
Good food and good service. A must try is the Ragi Dosa, Pudi Dosa and the Rava Idli. Of course, the filter coffee is a must try too. The staff is friendly and attentive. Do take the time to read the history of MTR restaurant as well as the story behind some of their signature dishes.Overall, a super culinary experience
5
We just absolutely love this place.. we bring our 10 year old daughter here and hope that we can bring our grand kids someday as well :). Building memories.. The food is amazing and payasam is to die for. Every time we visit this place, we wonder why we didn't come earlier. The staff are lovely- very attentive and the place is always super clean.
5
We were there on a Sunday and there were lots of people and a long queue but surprisingly we got a table immediately.We tried the weekend Menu and a few other dishes all of which came with surprising tastes and sometimes quite spicy but still good for our taste. We really liked it and price was very good. Also strongly recommendable to try the Lassies.
5
MTR is in little india . Food was good . They have an system of pay and go sit - they serve you ... liked the food . Coffee was not upto the bengaluru MTR flavour ... packed during weekends ...
5
MTR is a must visit during a visit to Serangoon road . The authentic South ka khana is delight especially the Ravi Idli and the masala dosa. Very pocket friendly + clean ambience + fast service . Must visit in little India
5
If you haven't been to MTR then you are missing the best vegetarian Indian food in Singapore. Go there and order the sambar idly and the dosai. Go now!
4
The crowds award this restaurant with their attendance in an area loaded with Indian restaurants. IT is southern Indian food and great.
4
Most delicious South Indian food in its authentic form served hot. The Masala Dosa and milked coffee are very enjoyable.
5
I’ve been several times to MTR. Clean, Hygienic, prompt service and variety to offer. I’ve had most of their items in the menu. Taste is very authentic. Last time I had Vanghi Bhatt, a typical Maharashtrian /Karnataka. Gravy was mixed in the rice adequately with oil and other spices added in the exact proportion you would expect. My stomach was almost full, but the taste was lingering in my mouth. We ordered Khara Bhat. The Manager asked us to wait for sometime, as they were just preparing. We’ve to wait for 5 minutes, but the food they served after 5 minutes was just divine. My colleague and I still talk about this in our office.All the products were fresh and the dishes had the warmth of home-made food. The chefs takes great care in selecting the best quality ingredients. The restaurant also caters for all such as South Indians and North Indians. If you are not a resident of Singapore and craving for a good food, visit MTR once. It is close to Mustafa
5
Reached the restaurant 9:40pm, while according to google update the restaurant closes at 9:30pm. We took a chance and was completely worth it. The Dosas were light and tasty. The sambar was authentic and is not to be missed. Despite the restaurant being crowded the service was quick.
1
The place is crowded and super-expensive with very little choice of food. The taste is just average.We ordered Rava dosa, Rava Indli and set dosa. Average price is about 5-6 sgd per dish which is way more expensive compared to what you find in other Indian restaurants. MTR singapore is definitely not the place you should chose for having good and authentic Indian food. The service is also poor. We wanted to have little extra sambar which the waiter refused to serve. I would not recommend this place to any visitor/ tourist coming to Singapore. Singapore is a food heaven and I am sure you will find good and delicious Indian food at other food court/ restaurants in Little India or any other area
3
We decided to try this out because of the great reviews it gets, seriously cannot understand why it is so high up there. Are they getting their friends to give good reviews???? This place is expensive and the food is nothing to be amazed about. I read so many reviews about how good the Mango Lassi was, it was sweet beyond belief, I had to water it down several times just to drink it. After this experience I am very suspicious of any place that charges more for their meals in Singapore, just go for the cheap places they are generally awesome and if they are not your pocket don't care anyway!
5
We went in for break fast and was amazed to get such a tasty south Indian style breakfast delicacies in Singapore. Definitely a must try. Don't be put off by the size of the restaurant seen from street view. Get in and place your order to experience it
4
The service here is really quick and the food is prepared well, tried the curd rice it was impeccable
4
Ghee dosa and sambar vada were good. Idly was ok. Gulab jamun is amazing! Quick service and reasonable prices.
5
All food items tasted very good.. if you are looking at authentic Indian food, this is the best place you can come to in LITTLE INDIA at Singapore. Just get down at perumal koil stop in little india, cross the road and reach this restaurant..
1
Good food . But the manager is worst person . He orders ppl where to sit . Always aim to send ppl out . Because of him can't enjoy food .

Very popular kannada style restaurant in Little India. High standards of hygiene evident in the kitchen staff. Great food at reasonable price. Ordering is a bit chaotic and can be streamlined better. Electronic order execution is pretty impressive.
5
Afer spending six months in Singapore, this fast became our favourite South Indian place! But make sure it´s open before you stop by!

I brought mum to MTR for lunch today, at the entrance of MTR, we were warmly welcomed by a very pleasant aunty even though she was busy with her cleaning work. It was our first time there and we were lost in what to order, a young waiter politely helped us with very good recommendation on food and drink, we enjoyed everything. He even came back to check with us if all was fine, impressive services. Shall certainly come back to MTR soon to try other delicious items.

I alongwith my Wife and Daugther were on our maiden visit to the beautiful city of Singapore. Being pure Vegitarians we scouted for a good restaurant, luckily found MTR on Serangoon Road in Li'l India. Liked the place, it is hygenic, clean and tidy. Food is very tasty and delicious especially dosas' and rice items. This Hotel, we can say, has successfully created a Niche for Udupi Taste in a far away place like Singapore. I am all admiration for this young team on their business adventure in a strange place, that too for Pure Vegitarian South Indian Food. We, all three of us, myWife, my daughter including, enjoyed our stay in S'pore, undoubtedly enhancedby our fine dining at MTR which made our stay more delightful.KrishnaPrasadBangalore.sumedhamicro@gmail.co

We visited MTR following the recommendation of South Indian colleagues in Singapore. The food was excellent and the service quick and attentive. Everything that the owners recommended to us was delicious and the prices super reasonable. Highly recommend to visitors and locals for an authentic South Indian food experience
5
We've visited a fair number of Indian restaurants during our Singapore visit. Some of them were good - in the sense that the food was tasty enough, and others were just plain bad. This is by far the only restaurant that authentically delivers the same taste that you get at the Bangalore MTR restaurant. We discovered this almost accidentally, and towards the end of our trip, and we just couldn't believe how authentic all the dishes were. And as for the taste, who could ever find fault in MTR's recipes? And to top this all, the staff is just first class. Very polite and very efficient.In short, if you want authentic Souh Indian food in Singapore, definitely visit this
5
Go for thali if you want to try different dishes. Dosa and idli were good. The dosa is made with organic red rice hence the dark color. But healthy for sure.
Clean small place with a huge line. Order first and then be seated.
5
Lovely masala dosa! Came on a recommendation and not disappointed! Great staff who found a disabled traveller a space easily. Should be TripAdvisor recommended as it was fab !! Big menu and full of locals.
4
Bustling modern restaurant serving traditional Indian vegetarian delicacies. All very freshly prepared. V clean and friendly. Has high throughput, so not a place to linger over/after your meal
4
Menu wasn't overly helpful unless you know a lot about Indian food. However going back and forth and ordering food seemed to sit OK with them. All tasty and spicy and the carrot halva was especially yummy. All in 30 SGD with 2 soft drinks.
5
Our favourite restaurant from Bangalore and astonishingly close in taste in singapore too. Deserves its place in the TOP restaurants of singapore. The Long queues are justified. Mr Rao the friendly manager is always trying to make your visit memorable. The staff is very good too!
5
A nice and crowded restaurant that is very clean with simple and authentic dishes. I think everything has been already mentioned on this top restaurant. I will insist on two:- the service is outstanding: clean, rapid and waiters really pay attention.- good choise for familly: you will find plain dosa and some other unspicy dishes likely to please and educate your kids
5
My father and I went here for lunch today (based off TA Reviews) and it was amazing! My dad is vegetarian so MTR checked that off the list and the food was delicious. We explored Little India first and then popped in for a bite to eat. The Masala Dosa, Bisibele Bhath and Honey Lemon water were all great! Definitely check it out if you're in the area
5
We go to MTR Singapore at least once every 4-6 weeks! Their Palin Dosa, Rava Idli and Almond Halwa are simply superb and highly recommended! In our opinion, their South Indian food is a 100 times better than what we used to eat in Bombay earlier. And to wash it all down you just need their authentic filter coffee! Very economical and their hygiene is top notch! At peak hours on weekends, it can be difficult to get a table and wait time can be longer. But their service is pretty quick and table turnovers are very fast. Highly recommend!
5
Went on a whim and was really pleased I did. Straight in, pleasant staff, busy with locals, no frills - good menu with pictures. The waiter helped me chose a couple dishes. Both really tasty. Good for a small group so you can sample each other's food.
5
We visited based on TripAdvisor reviews but a queue outside almost put us off. Fortunately a Balinese couple of Indian origin said the wait would not be too long, and best of all they recommended three dishes for the two of us: Bisibele Bhath, Masala Dosa and Rava Idli. They were all exquisite and with a mango lassi the cost was just S$22. Remarkable value and half what we paid for very average food at a street cafe in Chinatown
4
My first visit here and I was mighty pleased. Reminded me of earlier days in its original outlet at Lalbaug in Bangalore ( now Bengaluru).
Great wholesome fare, prompt and efficient service with a smile
4
We went to a few other South Indian restaurants before trying MTR - must say MTR is the best. Very clean place. Authentic food. The restaurant gets crowded at peak hours and is a little small. Service is excellent.
5
The waiter helped us making a good choice of different tastes for us beginners of indian food. They also recommended something not spicy for the children.
The food came on the table really fast.
The food was good and the mangolassi was delicious.
5
Had special meals thali awesome taste and sufficient enough for lunch. Dosa and coffee was OK. Need to first pay and then food will be served fast.
5
Value for money, friendly service and extremely delicious vegetarian food. What more can I ask for :)
5
Excellent food, very pleasant service, great value. We had the special meal, a tray full of treats for $11. Carrot desert was also delicious!!
4
The food quality is excellent, its freshly prepared with minimal spices. Set dosa, masala dosa and bisbillah bhath is a must try. It can certainly challenge any other south Indian restaurant in the town for its taste, service and value. Even the thali is good but i guess its too much for an individual to finish. At times it gets really crowded with waiting time almost over 30 mins.....I think it's time they should consider leasing out a bigger place, automate ordering system and make some arrangements for the folks waiting for their turn
4
We frequent here atleast once a month being bangaloreans. There aren't many places that give you the authentic taste of BLR in Singapore. Everything is freshly prepared and served. My best picks are Set Dosa (You won't get anywhere in SG), Badam Halwa (too pricey but worth a lick), filter coffee and Ravi Idli..A sumptuous meal for two with a coffee should not cost more than 30
4
MTR is no doubt one of the best South Indian restaurants. I have also eaten at MTR Bangalore and taste in Singapore is almost similar. I would obviously rate Bangalore one as the best. Its slightly pricey compared to other south Indian restaurants in Singapore and serving portions are also small.My personal favourite is the Masala Dosa as it is crispier and thicker one which you don't get anywhere in Singapore
5
First time coming here after rave reviews about this place. Have always known this place for its snacks but eating here was a different experience by itself. The food was fast, hot and great! Tasted very yummy. My family always arranges plenty of gatherings and are constantly looking for good catering places. This one is def the TOP 3 on the list of caterers now! I will def come back again!
5
Great place if you fancy eating authentic Bangalore dosa's. Fresh food clean place great service. Caring and friendly staff. Must try their dosas Rava idli khara bhath!! Absolutely love the taste of everything I have ordered and eaten there!!
4
Very good Indian Food. Love the tastes. Visited with my family. All the food is delicious. Would always go back.
5
Easily the best Indian restaurant in Singapore. The only one that comes close to replicating the taste of the original restaurant in India.
4
Beautiful Indian flavours, some hot and others not so hot. Plenty of cooling accompaniments and drinks. Although the restaurant was full when we visited, the service was prompt and staff monitored our needs well. Loved the Indian dishes I had not tried before.
5
We visit this hotel in Dec 2016 we were a group of 3 family with kids. The service is great . The owner is a nice gentlemen . The food is also delicious. Try gajar halwa ,shera , and set dosa
Rates are also reasonable
5
I would rate this as the best South Indian eatery in Singapore. Restaurant is absolutely clean, have the best of the support staff. Ask for suggestions if you don't know what to order.The place as expected is mostly crowded, expect 20-30 mins waiting during Peak hours
5
Honestly.. I have been to a lot of Indian restaurents in singapore. But for me any day the taste and quality of food at MTR is same as that you get in Bangalore.PRO:1) Good Variety on menu,  2)Very clean and Hygenic. 3)Authentic & quality food.Cons: 1)Small place- need to que for your turn. 2) A bit expensive compared to other indian places at little india
5
We were searching for the best indian arround singapour and foud this little eatery! Was an extraordinary surprise. This is not the average indian sustenance : nam + curry and so forth .. its indian from an other district. Their sustenance is quite recently yummy and not costly at all :) higly suggested
5
This restaurant i a must visit place if you like south Indian food. The taste and quality of the food, cleanliness, service are all awesome. its d best restaurant in little India. they are super busy on the weekends, so expect some waiting time. I usually do not write reviews, but this place deserved 5 stars and a special mention
5
While in Singapore we were searching for a good restaurant serving Indian vegetarian food and came across MTR which serves real good South Indian cuisines. While you may have to wait for a while, the wait is worth every second. Although we normally take North Indian food at home but MTR offers real good South Indian preparation and made us feel at home. It was such a delight that, we were drawn there for a couple for meals for 2-3 days
5
Fresh produce and well cooked. Pls try the podi dosa for that adds spice to your tongue. Pls try the uppit on Sunday.
4
Warm welcome. Proper guidance of menu choices . Excellent & authentic South Indian food . Specially pineapple sheera was good
5
The best south Indian delicacies I had in Singapore. In my short stay at Singapore, I had visited twice. I have recommended some of my friends to visit this place.
5
Amazing food. Easily the best South Indian food in Singapore. Very friendly staff. A place to visit again and again!
5
For those who love thosai or who have not like thosai before...
I have yet to taste a better Thosai Masala😂
Besides Thosai they have a few varieties, they are equally yummy!
I am always having difficulty making a decision what to fill my tummy...
4
Excellent Podi Thosai. All items looked appetising. Decent service. Variety of authentic south Indian food amid a nice ambience. A must come back.
5
Easily one of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore. Flavours are great, actually it so yummy. The restaurant was absolutely bursting at the seams when we went. The service though is quick and excellent and we had a super tasty and very reasonably priced vegetarian dinner
3
Food is average, but no complaints about the quality or price. The ambience and the way they operate is something else. First the noise levels are too high, very unpleasant to eat in peace and enjoy the food. The other part, for some reason MTR decided to make this a pre pay for the food which is very inefficient and inconvenient. The place is so small and the cashier sits at the entrance. If there are three people behind you, you have to stand outside or block someone inside the restaurant. Unless you are very familiar with the menu, you will take more time to order as you have to decide all you want to eat at the cash counter it self. To make things more difficult, the menu changes everyday. If you want to add or delete any item to your order once you seat yourself, it becomes very complicated. MTR is such a popular and old organisation, one would think they mastered the operations. May be they need to learn few things on how their Udipi restaurants operate in India (very swift and efficient during rush hours). They should rethink on pre payment process and let the customer order once they are seated from the menu so that they do not feel rushed
4
The restaurant is extremely popular and there is a perpetual rush. People queue up for a while - however, it moves quite fast.Food is reminiscent of MTR in Bangalore - hence, apart from the taste, it brngs back a touch of nostalgia.The price however is on the higher, at least in comparison to its Bangalore counterpart.All in all, worth visiting
5
The Resturant was established in 1924 as Mavalli Tiffin Rooms near lal bagh in bangalore all time crowded due to the reputation of using finest raw materials and excellent taste.The Singapore is a off shoot of the same management and established in Singapore.The taste is very good and nothing to find fault with any of the items.Coffee is the finest to be mentioned and pure Indian filter coffee not to be missed.Bisi bele bath is the one item i eat often
5
Awesome Idli wada ..well served .Delicious than Indian MTR .loved the ambiance . And the staff are so humble .
5
The Rava idli, Bissibelle bath is a must have... even the Dosas are very good. The service is quick but be prepared to wait for 10-20 mins if going during peak hours on Sundays or Public Holidays
4
went here after recommendation by a friend and i have to say we really loved the food as well as the quantity served.
Pretty fast service, not too expensive either.
3
hmm.. I am not too sure, the taste differs for all who eats.. I am concern on the service and quality of the food.. question is.. is it worth waiting too long to get a seat and try out the food..
5
We really enjoyed eating at MTR. It is super clean and the food here is delicious. Try the rava idli and dosa
5
Authentic south Indian food only next best to mum's cooking.
All the other reviews speak for themselves.
4
Indian ex-pat friends of friends told us about this vegetarian place. Everything I tried was very good. We had a couple different dosas, and both hit the spot.
4
The restaurant was full even though it was way past lunchtime but they have a ordering cum seating system that seems to work well. As we are not familiar with South Indian cuisine, the gentleman at the cashier where the orders are taken patiently made recommendations. When we finished ordering, a table had been cleared and the food arrived fairly quickly. Seeing that we were unfamiliar with the many different sauces, another gentleman came to explain and diligently did that with each new dish. We had the special set for the day which came with a starter and a main for only S$12. Plus a few smaller dishes. We are unable to assess how genuine the food is but all the dishes recommended were quite delicious. The meal for 4 cost us under S$50. The restaurant has been open since 1924 so it must be one of the oldest restaurants in Singapore.
5
We visited this restaurant just down the street from our hotel after reading the solid reviews on Trip Advisor. We were very happy. The dosas were delicious as was a spiced vegetable rice dish. The service was very friendly, helpful and efficient. It's not a fine dining restaurant to linger in, but the constant stream of customers is testimony to the quality. Highly recommend!
5
This is the best south Indian food you can get in Singapore. We were very excited to know that they opened in Singapore and make it a point to visit at least twice a month. The dosas and meals are just incredible... The taste is very authentic. Highly recommended for anyone looking for authentic Karnataka style cuisine
5
Authentic Indian, That too specifically Mangalorean Vegeterian Food served with smile here. Visit and enjoy the food.
5
One of the best South Indian restaurants in Singapore! The food is indeed very good and a great service. You may have to wait for quite sometime to find place to sit - that goes to show how popular is this place!
5
If I could only eat more... :). It was fantastic and the staff is super friendly and attentive. Be prepared to eat with your (right) hand though! You'll get two spoons, bit it's even more yummy if you eat the Indian way. I'd love to taste everything on the menu please. It's vegetarian heaven
5
I've been here numerous times and this place never disappoints. I don't know what they put in the dosa, but it is very yummy and addictive - the masala in the dosa is unique, mouth-watering and be warned that the more you eat it, the more you want more. I've tried other things and they are all delicious, but i am a creature of habit and always end up ordering the masal dosa. Apart from the food, the restaurant is well maintained, the restrooms are very clean. Staff are very friendly and always checking if the guests enjoy the food. I imagined that with the amount of people and their orders, the kitchen would be hectic. but when I once managed to peek into the kitchen and was pleasantly surprised by how well organised the kitchen staff were. Food is more pricey than what you may find in other stalls/restaurants in the area. But for food of this standard in and airconditioned place, it is definitely well worth it.
4
Great food at a reasonable price . Glad I read earlier reviews on this place as its by far the best of its type I have found since arriving in Singapore 8 months ago .We enjoyed dosai and curd vardais .Unlike some other restaurants nearby the washrooms are also in good conditionHighly recommended 
5
This is a genuine little family run Indian eatery. Everything on their menu is okay. Regardless of the possibility that you need to sit tight for 20 minutes to get a table, it merits holding up. We requested sustenance while holding up so when we got the table, our nourishment arrived. I will surely do a reversal to MTR when I visit Singapore once more
5
MTR was the best dining experience I had in Singapore. The food is excellent quality, fresh and totally delicious. Dishes are subtly spiced with a note of fresh ghee and careful use of seasoning. We liked the akki roti, puris and vadai most of all, other standouts were pongal and rava idli that had skilled layers of mustard seed and curry leaf flavour. Dosai are a different style to Komala Vilas and arguably not quite as good, arguably. Coffee is fresh and you can taste the roast. Service is friendly and efficient, the premeses are spotless, comfortable and well managed. MTR1924 is my new favourite South Indian restaurant, you'll love it
4
The place was crowded - evidence of its popularity. All the items were cooked well, in ghee no doubt, but there was something undefinable missing. The sada dosa, for instance, was a bit too thick. I was pleasantly surprised by the godhi (wheat) dosa. It was tasty, with a fair sprinkling of chopped green chillies and coriander leaves. While location no doubt is the key, the management should look for larger accommodation. The cramped space is a deterrent for frequent visits.
5
I wasn't too sure about the different types of South Indian food, only know general ones like thosai and prata. The waiter was extremely helpful in making us decide the various dishes to try out as it was the first time for the Japanese students trying out Indian food. The taste of the food was somewhat to their liking and they enjoyed the new experience there. A must go for a hearty meal that doesn't make you feel bloated afterwards
5
I've found most Indian restaurants in Singapore underwhelming - either in taste or authenticity. This one is definitely not! It derives its name from the famous restaurant in Bangalore and the options available are simple & authentic at fantastic prices. Other than the usual Dosa & Idli options, you also have the Meal option which is many things (Dosa, Rice, veggies, Papad, Indian dessert) on one plate. You order and pay first and then proceed to take your seat which goes with the ethos of the restuarant - fast and efficient. Lunch times can be pretty busy so choosing your timeslot helps. Overall, a place I wouldn't mind to keep visiting
4
If you are craving for indian food in singapore....by chance....then hop in.....you should taste their rava idly and other south indian delicacies in pure karnataka style......after a good dharshan from the perumal temple opposite....get in here...and fill your palate with a lip smacking indian food....
5
This was may second visit to Singapore and maintained very well and authentic Udupi Lunch Meal was good.
Recommended to all South Indian Food eaters
5
A genuine South Indian food experience. Amazing to see the grand old taste is still maintained and served without any compromise.
4
Most of the menu has pretty much retained its authentic Mavalli Tiffen Room, Banglore taste. I have always felt comfortable with the quality of the food. I love the taste and the place is clean.
5
It's a famous and popular pure authentic South Indian Vegetarian Restaurant in Singapore and here one can enjoy Masala Dosa, Rava Idlii, MTR Set Meal and Pure Filter Coffee really the food is very tasty and yummy one must visit this place for Pure Vegetarian South Indian Food.
2
Very dissapointed saw in the Trpadvisor #6 went to MTR with family with full hope. At the end the food is expensive one thing its ok. Just an average taste tekka market is better.. The food served after 45min and the dring was served after we food anothr 30 min... no worth waiting. V poor. Tripadvisor must reate correctly next time...
5
Firstly, The food here is absolutely delicious. Thankfully, we went in a big group so we could try lots of different dishes - each one was wonderful. The manager kept providing recommendations and none of them dissapointed. Not just the manager but the staff was extremely courteous - it felt that each one of them was there to make sure you had the best experience possible. This is a must go place - again and agai
4
I must confess I wanted to try this restaurant for quite some time. Why? 1 - Wanted to try it because... It was highly recommended 2- couldn't because.... Each time it was full. Today finally could mainly due to a colleague recommendation to go slightly earlier. Yes.... You guessed it.... Only 15 minutes since we arrived the restaurant was full. Did not disappointed and met expectations. Good food and kind service. I will go back for sure. See you soo
4
We ate Podi Masala Uttapam , Tayiru vadai ,the kesaribath and uppuma ...all were awesome. The coffee was strong and good....My 1st visit as i seldom frequent veg joints but and i will return. The Manager...Mr.Srini was friendly and he suggested a few dishes , which was all excellent. He also gave us to try Bisele.(some dhal rice mixture with spices) ,kinda good...heard its their best seller...good marketing tactic.I loved the podi masala uttapam. My take the price is reasonable.Good job Mr. Srini & MT
3
This is a famous restaurant in Bangalore, India. Usually we tamil people don't like the taste of Karnataka sambar which is sweet. Hence we did not like the taste of most of the items on their menu. we prefer Komalas over this restaurant. Also service is very poor. People who serves doesn't look pleasant. Not sure how this restaurant is rated top in Singapore
5
Excellent, authentic and tasty food. Very hygenic. It is so good that very often there are no tables available, expect a short/medium waiting period. Due to the demand be ready to share a table with strangers. Highly recommended.
4
Excellent vegetarian food. Simple and clean ambience. Must try is rave idly and masala dosa. Absolutely the best in Singapore, similar to the original MTR in Bangalore.
The lunch options can be made better.
5
If you are looking for the most authenticated South Indian Veg food in Singapore, you are at right place! I visit this place almost every week end to ensure I don't miss the food which is as delicious as Bengaluru MTR.While the sambar & rasam served in set meal are slightly spicy for others(non Indians), the quality & authenticity are not compromised. You never get the dosa, idli & uddina vada of this quality anywhere else in Singapore. Over all it has reasonable pricing, hygiene and taste. Worth visiting if you are in Singapor
5
The quality of the food is excellent, and the smell of ghee pervades your senses. The menu is limited with varieties of Dosas, Idli, Vada and the must try Bisi bele bath, but your appetite will be sated with these dishes. Since it is so popular be prepared to wait in the queue for a bit
4
This is a modest restaurant serving fantastic dosai and rice varieties at a reasonable price. This is NOT your place if you want to have prata or briyani. It can get pretty crowded on weekends so please be prepared to wait for a seat if you're planning to visit during peak hours. You will have to share your table with fellow diners too. I ordered karabath, a breakfast item made using somelina and vegetables, podi Masala dosai and Masala tea. Karabath was pretty nice but the show stealer was the Masala dosai. The potatoes were well-cooked, subtly spiced and the portion was neither small nor huge. The dosai was crispy, thin and buttery. The Masala tea was good too.Overall, this is your place if you're a fan of Masala dosai or you want to try out other Indian breakfast options other than pratas
5
MTR is our favorite restaurant in Singapore for authentic top quality tiffins. We have been going there so many times and yet the quality is simply superb. It is no wonder that during peak hours queues stretch out of the restaurant.Not only is their food and choice top notch the ambience and setup is very nice.Warning: when the place is packed with people it can get noisy so best to avoid these rush hours.Go during off peak hours like early lunch or early dinner. Then with the back drop of the Perumal temple you can really enjoy their excellent snacks
4
MTR chose Singapore as their first stop outside of India for expansion according to an Indian friend of mine. And rightly so!! The first thing that hits you the moment you step in is your nostrils....unmistakable aroma of great food!!! The place is clean as well, I must add (though the last time I was there was some time back)
4
We were looking for the best indian arround singapour and foud this little restaurant! Was a great surprise. This is not the typical indian food : nam + curry etc .. its indian from an other region. Their food is just yummy and not expensive at all :) higly recommended
5
I am amazed that they are a full service restaurant that manages the kind of volume despite being well outside the touristy region of Little India. The food is amazing, and very unique. As much as I love the comfortable uniformity of vegetarian south Indian in Singapore, this restaurant brings a whole new angle by offering authentic Udupi cuisine that are flavorful and memorable. Special thanks to the wait staff who were so attentive and helpful during our dinner
5
Had been to MTR Singapore to explore the south Indian food. Felt as if I was at my home state Karnataka entire staff and the atmosphere was like that majority of them speaking in Kannada. Needless to mention about the taste of dosa and authentic coffee. Had superb Karnataka style dosa and coffee .
5
Food tastes very fresh and good. Like the Dosas and the Rava Idli very much. The ambience is clean. The place is quite busy so may take some time to get your seat but worth the wait :)
5
Excellent place for nice hearty and simple breakfast with smiling service and pleasant ambience. Best South Indian food in South East Asia. Mr. Rao the manager there does excellent work of explaining dishes and serves at most care along with his crew.
5
Best south indian resturant with awesome taste , nice dosas , there podi dosas awesome ,sambar ,chutneys all amazing
5
This place serves very good south indian food with great taste.Its located in Little india and easily accessible to people.
5
Never eaten anything as delicious- anywhere! And that's saying quite a lot- being a vegetarian and a South Indian / udipi cuisine fan. The food overall is fantastic!
5
Love the quality of food and their service! They even give good advice when you are spoilt w too good of choices. Love that you can taste the ghee on all their thosai dish. Always come back for more..
5
Very Good indian restaurant! Very nice and polite staff! the Food is fantastic! Great varieties and and the taste is like what you expect from an indian food. We Also loved the enterior! We want to come back again! Highly recommended!
5
The people of the MTR know how to make you smile.The food is very good and the staff is always nice and serving.The variety of different dishes on the menu is optimal, just right.I ordered a Dosa and a Masala Chai, both just perfectly hot, spicy and delicious.From my heart I can recommend the MTR.Pricing is middle class, but the cleanliness and the atmosphere together with the extraordinary food definitely pay off!!!I walked more than 1.8km to reach this gem!Cheers,Floria
5
This was my second visit to the restaurant. Aptly placed outside the Farrer park MRT and the temple, the restaurant offers sumptuous south indian meal. Though the prices are on a bit higher side, the taste was awesome. We enjoyed the masala dosa and pudi dosa with coffee
3
This restaurant is listed in the top 10 in Singapore as seen by trip advisor. Let that sink in for a moment ....Singapore has some of the finest dining and for anything to make it to top 10 - it has to be good right ? Well we went to MTR with high expectations. The process is quite different to other restaurant in the area - you place the order to the cashier , pay and he gives you a card with a number on it . You now need to scout around the room to find a vacant seat - good luck if you come here with a big group - we had to wait 10 or so mins to find a seat. I ordered a masala dosai and my wife a chappti set, we also ordered mango lassis. My dosai was ok - overdone at parts the condiments were okay - not bad but not great . My wife didn't enjoy the chappati set - stating it wasn't duly cooked and the accompaniments weren't all that good . The lassi however was great - very nice .All in all - considering the high ranking it has received , the wait you have to endure and the average taste - I just cant recommend this place. For our palate - we still prefer ananda bhavan on serangoon rd(at the start of serangoon rd
5
I visited MTR few days back during my trip to Singapore with Family and thoroughly enjoyed the food un MTR. The quality and taste is top notch and better than many restaurants in India and the service is fast and very good.
5
MTR Singapore is 1 of the goto places if you want quick and good service, clean and reasonably priced food. The food is Authentic and fresly made. The service is fast, efficient and friendly at the same time. I would definitely visit again.
5
Had our first breakfast in Singapore!! That's after pretty long journey from bangalore. Same taste,quality and feel....Good service and friendly staff.
4
Excellent food, reminds me of Bangalore. Nostalgic. Vada is crispy, Sambar has typical Bangalore taste. Dosa mad of ghee.
Crowded and they need more space.
5
I would recommend a meal at MTR for anyone visiting or living in Singapore. Great food, tastes like home made, excellent service, friendly staff and very clean.
5
Do you want to have south indian food? Then go to MTR, you get the best south indian food in Singapore. The dosas are amazing, they have a wide variety of food options with a special menu almost everyday. The staff are friendly and service is very good. They also have the best filter coffee and Mango milkshake. Overall I would say you never get bored of the food over there
4
Really love the food served here, especially the Rava Idli and Masala Dosa. Service is quick and efficient, prices reasonable. For Indian-food lovers, this restaurant is a must-try. I came back several times, and always got the same delicious taste and satisfaction, so the cooking is really consistent. But take note of their operating hours, they open 8:30 AM till 3:00PM, close from 3:00 PM till 5:30 Pm, then open again from 5:30 Pm till 9:30 PM
5
One of the best place to have food in Singapore. Fresh, more than a value for money. The quality of food is great, service is superb and flexible with the menu options. Plenty of varieties to try over there. I wish they will open their food chain in Sydney

We visit this place for breakfast and of all the udipi joints, we relish the medu wadas the most as they are piping hot and fresh, unlike the ones at Ananda Bhavan. The bisi bele bhaat, the puliogare preparations, all the stuff actually is very tasty and authentic. Not the cheapest in udipi, but the quality more than makes up for the very slightly more cost. And anyways South Indian food is cheap compared to any North Indian restauran

I was introduced to MTR by a good colleague from India whom wanted for me to taste the real south India cuisine. Well this place was where I become opposed with Indian food. The restaurant décor did nothing for me, it is uninteresting and to the unversed, the space is constraint with limited seats, and becomes enclosed. However the food is flawless, the taste prominence on quality of ingredients and it is avaricious. The service it’s prompt and the staff are attentive well trained, they provide excellent and attentive service from the moment you are seated down.I'm definitely a returning customer
4
Been there by chance..
Not sure what to expect, the food was very good.. but don't expect a trendy place .. quality food at affordable price is what you get./
4
The service is quick and good price.Authentic Indian food.The masala dosai was excellent. I liked mango lassy.
3
I like the food but due to the space constraint the service is not good and the owner does not respect the customers
4
Food is delicious for Indian Bangalore vegetarian meal in a local atmosphere. The service is quick and reasonable prices. Queue is little too much for week end lunch
5
Even better than Gokul and Komala Villas - which is already quite a feat. Fairly priced as well. Highly recommended.
5
Had a delicious brunch at MTR restaurant. Service is super fast with meals coming out within minutes. A very popular place and it's easy to see why. The chilled almond drink was a standout.
5
Weekday lunches at MTR, with a selection of Bise bile bhaat, masala dosa, vada, and buttermilk is a sheer culinary delight.While the menu is simple, the food is fresh and homely. And the personalised service is TOP class. Weekday menus seem a little more ample and generally a better experience than weekends.I wish they would work a bit harder on the ambience - and while the authentic touches are nice, aspects like tightly spaced tables and noisy fans could be better. Nonetheless, an outstanding experience
5
This is a real small family run Indian restaurant. Everything on their menu is really good. Even if you have to wait for 20 minutes to get a table, it's worth waiting.We ordered food while waiting so as soon as we got the table, our food arrived. I will certainly go back to MTR when I visit Singapore again
3
We had dinner on one day here. The food was good overall, but turned out spicier than we would have liked. The kids had a problem with that. The bisibele bath was not very authentic. The honey-lemon juice was excellent though!A packed place with limited seats, becomes a bit claustrophobic. Would recommend this place for good south indian stuff, but kids might find it spicy
5
Went in already knowing about the legendary original establishment in Bangalore. Came out absolutely blown away - the Singapore branch is fully the equal of the original, which is high praise indeed. Singapore is well served for high quality Southern Indian food, there are multiple fine eateries in the genre.But MTR is simply the best, and that is truly saying something. Every single item on the menu that I have tried over this and several subsequent visits is top notch, so it is consistent excellence, not just a couple of signature dishes. That said, the 'sambar' and the bisi bele bhaath are 2 items which many good restaurants notoriously fail to get just right, and are usually inferior to what one would be served in many good homes. MTR do both superbly. Apart from those, the rava idli, the entire range of dosas, and of course the terrific filter coffee are all outstanding. The badam milk is also gret for those with a sweet tooth.All in all, really not much more that one can say. Not sure MTR needs any further introduction or boosting, but here you are
5
Visited last week with my friend... Place is overflowing on weekdays at lunchtime - a testament to the quality & service. Food is delicious & some of their dishes cannot be found anywhere else in Singapore !!
5
Food was very good and fresh. Staff was also very efficient. Definitely recommended as a nice place for the whole family
5
We recently stumbled upon this via Burpple. As locals, we have now been back weekly as this is our new favourite breakfast spot. The masala dosai and pudi masala dosai are incredible. And the mango lassis are to die for. You won't want to share!
5
Good clean relaxed environment. Excellent friendly service, giving advice on menu choices, alternatives to menu offered, just go with it everything is good quality and a symphony of spices and flavours, nothing too spicy.
4
This was a lovely place for South Indian food in Singapore. The place is crowded with people and the owners are mostly into making quick turnover. This ruins your experience a little.Food wise, everything is lovely. Food is fresh and well prepared. Good value for money
4
Authentic South Indian food. Came here with Indian colleagues so they do the ordering & I just eat. Everything is good, but the food is quite spicy even I asked for less spicy option. I was perspiring so much only after 5 minutes even the place is air conditioned! The staffs here are very friendly & one of them was observant enough to turn the fan towards me.This is a busy place, be here early if you want to get a place
5
MTR should be made as one of the top tourist attractions of Singapore. The food is truly divine for the veg lovers. Coming from Chennai to Singapore as a tourist, We never expected such a high quality & delicious food in Singapore. The must-try items are masala dosa, bisibela, puliogare, badam halwa, set dosai and rava idli. The restaurant is an exact replica of Bangalore Lalbagh MTR in terms of taste & quality. But with due respect to Lalbagh MTR which is their main branch, MTR Singapore is much better in terms of service and ambience as well. Special mention of Mr.Srinivasa Rao who made our visit pleasant everytime
4
Do visit this place for South Indian delicacies . Small place and lots of rush . There is a waiting list always . Idli with a small "katori " of ghee is must . Rasam Vada and toooo good . Nice place in singapore for South Indian food better than any alternate .
5
This hole-in=-the-wall Indian/ restaurant always has a waiting line, and for good reasons. It's Southern Indian cuisine - Karajan - is made to order and excellent. We were the only two non-Indian diners when we visited. Everything is vegetarian (except for a lot of ghee!), but we saw nothing green! Almost the entire menu consists of one kind or another of grain. They didn't have the only bean dish we saw on the menu. So - be prepared for something different and nothing light! AND - an entire meal for two cost under $30. No alcohol
5
We have been going very often to MTR since the time they opened in Singapore and I must say they have been very consistent in providing great quality and delicious vegetarian dishes based on Karnataka cuisine.We have tried different breakfast options like dosas, upmas etc, lunch options like special meals and dinner options too and all of them have been delicious and true to the cuisine. Point to note is that the meals did not come with the same run of the mill curries each time we had, there was variation in the dishes.What stands out here is a honest effort to serve the customer
4
Good atmosphere and the locals seem to come here for authentic types of food. It was cheap and recommend it for a quick bite.
5
We go often to this restaurant as it has the best service and the quality of food is excellent. They serve the food in a very authentic Mangalorean style which makes us feel like homely food. I would surely recommend.
5
Best south Indian food you can have in Singapore.... if you are from Karnataka you will feel home .... friendly staff quality food and best taste ....
5
Great for the seasoned South Indian food hunter because it is as good as it gets and the best way to introduce South Indian food virgins is the MTR.
Always the go to if in Singapore.
5
It's a place where we go quite often and we have always been impressed with the quality of food and hospitality. Everyone is so warm and they take care of the people so well. Food is just exellent .
5
Though bit expensive when compared to other Indian restaurants that serve similar food, if you are looking for authentic Karnataka (India) food, this is the place you should visit. You may feel the space is bit cramped but food makes you forget all that shortcomings.
4
I went to the restaurant with my 2 buddies. They were hungry for food and all were fine when we started ordering food. The waiter was friendly and polite. We found the food up to standard. Taste wise perfect.
5
Very authentic mainly South Indian Vegetarian tiffin. Its as good and as tasty as in the original MTR at Bangalore. A 40+ years taste ....wow still the same n classic.This outlets plus is its Hygiene n very friendly staff.If they can change the seating system to "seat first n take order on the table" will be better for new n many who are not regulars. (They do accommodate when not a big queue at the ordering stage).Keep it up******
5
I am not vegetarian, and never plan to be. But if I had to be, then MTR would make it almost enjoyable. We weren't sure what to order so let the waiter suggest: the food was so full of flavors and textures that I'd go back in a heartbeat. And a full meal for 2 including drinks for $20 ... now that deserves 5 stars!
4
Hiked up Serangoon Rd, in the searing midday sun, having got off the MRT one stop too early. It was worth the hike to this quaint little vegetarian Indian restaurant with a neighbourhood vibe. The staff were great and were happy to guide us through the menu, suggesting some dishes for the fussy kids. Alas the kids ate nothing but rice and roti, but the parents thoroughly enjoyed the array of dishes offered. I'm still running off the sugar buzz from the mango lassi.
5
Must visit for hygienic , tasty and authentic udupi veg . Mr Rao and Satish along will pamper you with the homely food.
5
Good here is really tasty and the prices are great too. I ordered the Masala Dosa for around 6 SGD - so tasty and they even adjusted the level of spiceyness for me. Great spot for a bite after visiting the temples along Serangoon Road.
5
We are regulars at MTR and have been following a 'Sunday breakfast at MTR' schedule for months now. Delicious food, Fast and friendly service and the best Podi Dosa in Singapore has made it our top choice.
5
Best south indian food in Singapore !! there's always queue but things move fast. $25-30 per couple max
5
Three of us went to MTR for Lunch, had Sambar Vada, wangi Bath and Podi Dosa. The taste was awesome and the host manager also customized the dosa to make it more crispy and intensify it with lot of podi...the outcome was a super hot dosa. Made my day
3
I have been going to this restaurant since it opened. The quality of the food and service was great at first! Being a weekly customer I noticed some sort of attitude in the manager this week when I went. We had ordered food and coffee. We finished our food but were in a hurry so I asked the staff for a take away glass so I could carry my coffee. My manager came back with a very stubborn face and said "You must let me know if you need this coffee for take away. I charge extra for takeaway glasses". I was very shocked with his behavior because he sees me so often but if he is developing that money minded attitude because of the growing popularity there is no way he is going to succeed. It was not that I had planned to carry the coffee with me but because of an urgent issue I wanted to leave quickly. I am surprised with this sort of behavior and this is exactly when I know this restaurant is going to be closed down soon. HORRIBLE ATTITUD
5
1) The food is really nice and the preparation is fresh. It is definitely one of the better places in town that offer good South Indian cuisine.2) The staff is really nice and helpful and the service levels are quite high. Your food is generally on your table within a few minutes after you are seated. You gotta be there to see how fast they serve you.All n all - we have had great dining experiences so far
5
The Singapore MTR is a piece of Vegetarian culinary heaven. This restaurant is a part of the MTR chain that has been in a Bangalore since 1924 serving the South Indian (Karnataka style) cuisine. The Singapore MTR maintains the MTR tradition and serves some of the favorites in its most authentic form. The 'Pudi Masala Dosa' (which is a variant of Masala Dosa) with ground chili powder sprinkled on the dosa along with the onion-potato dry curry, is a spicy treat that ignites taste buds. Desserts like 'Gulab Jamun' , and the MTR special dessert 'Chandrahara' are also served.
5
Light, tasty, reasonably priced, almost didn't want to review this so as to keep the secret to myself! Have the wonderfully crisp vadai, masala dosai (which i normally dislike as it's always soggy) amazing sambar and super crisp rava dosai. Also their most famous dish, the ravva iddly is unmissable. NB go for the tiffin timings, as these dishes are only available then i.e. 830 to 1130 am and 530 - 930pm. great for vegans and those on gluten free diets too
5
Had dinner and breakfast with my family at the MTR on several occasions after I came across it on tripadvisor. I like the convenience of dining there as food is served very quickly and service prompt. The menu is also varied enough to remain interesting for us and the kids
4
Value for money and nice service and good family restaurant. This is conveniently located in Serangoon road in Little India, Singapore
5
This is a must-go for south-Indian tiffin lovers.. Don't miss their Rava Idli, Podi Masala Dosai, Karabaath & Buttermilk... Out of the world !!!
4
we stopped by to have an indian tea and a breakfast which were ok.The place is very crowded and tiny. I guess it is so popular because of the low prices.
5
overall experience good, all Indian food available and nice test, nice service, budget cost wise, really good
4
Whenever we are in farrer park area , we make it a point to eat at MTR restaurant.we have tried many restaurants in that area but nothing comes close to the taste of its dishes.also a plus point is the cleanliness of the place.definetly worth visiting always and if one is visiting farrer park area
5
This restaurant serves South Indian vegetarian food that is is of the Kannada style. There is emphasis on quality of ingredients and good service. Prices are a little on the higher side compared to other Indian restaurants in the Little India area. I have no problems with the prices though, given that the quality is consistently good and service is prompt and attentive with well trained staff. Be prepared to order a few items as one order will not be sufficient for a meal for one person. With drinks, expect to pay about $25 for two persons
4
I have been here several times and thought I should write a short review.MTR serves fresh and very good food.. I had the Masala Dosa, Plain Dosa and Uddin Vada. Dosas have a very nice ghee fragrance. They serve excellent Masala tea too.Place is clean and service is good
5
We went to this place based on the positive reviews of other users and we were not disappointed.The staff were helpful and the locals took us through the menu and made some recommendations that were perfect. Some of the dishes we had included the Ragi Dosa, Bisbele Bhath and the Udin Vada. This place is a pretty special find. Great value and on the list of places to see again.
5
I was brought here by a colleague from south India who thought this was the right place to introduce me to good cuisine in little India (and indeed Singapore). He was dead right.The decor is frankly a little drab and to the uninitiated (me) the menu options looked uninspiring, but the food is flawless. The substance is there. All the rest is just the frilly bits anyway (but of course, service was friendly and prompt). Now this place is a recommendation of mine
3
I was surprised to see the prices of items. We do have a lot of vegetarian restaurants in Singapore at affordable prices. This restaurant charges too high for such a small quantity of food. Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner it's the same story. For each and everything you have to go the counter to order so you pay first and eat later. I can eat at other restaurants at a nominal price
4
Good place for Indian vegetarian food. Very similar to their parent restaurant in Bangalore. A must try if you are for vegetarian food.
5
Atmosphere is usually crowded but when some one wants to enjoy good authentic food then who cares about the crowd in the restaurant. CAN WAIT PATIENTLY TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF WAITING.
3
While not the same as the original MTR in Bangalore, it is nice to have another option for dosa, idli, vada and filter coffee. The Rava Idli is my favorite!
4
The south indian is famous for its karabath and ghee dosa. Crowded on weekends - may need to queue up. The place is a bit cramped.
5
Long queues suggest that it's a restaurant much in demand. The food is very authentic. They have a very helpful Pictoral menu for people not familiar with south Indian food
4
Mavalli Tiffin Room is best known for "Rave Idly". Roti is also good. "Chandra Hara" sweet, which is prepared especially on Thursday's is very delicious.
4
If you are South Indian food lover, this one is one of the restaurant in Singapore.
Try Bisibili bhaat here. Superb karnataka style veg food. Even I liked Aloo bonda, mysore masala dosa and many more dishes. Filter coffee not that good, but ok.
5
Not a great fan of Veg Food....but must admit this place served the best MASALA DOSA and CHAIII!! I guess I can shift to being a Veg if food is provided by MTR... ;) besides food the service is also excellent and friendly staff!!! Thanks guys and keep up the great job
5
This place has the best south Indian food in Singapore. It's not a fine done place and expect rush on weekends and peak hours. But the movement of people is fast and you are sure to get a table within 10 min. The food is fresh and yummy. I especially love the podi dosa and the rava onion dos
5
Whenever my family is in doubt of where to eat, we always pick MTR!! MTR has the best food and service and the restaurant is also bustling with energy and people! The food is absolutely fantastic and everybody in the restaurant in always smiling which makes me feel great as a costumer. It is also the best place if you want to eat something which is not too expensive. I'm from India so I can safely say that this is some of the best Indian food I've ever had
5
I like the diversity of dishes, the simplicity of the place, the affordable prices 5-10$, ...
For sure not a place for a romantic dinner, rather a great cantine, simple, good, filling.
To try: dosa
4
Not bad for authentic kannada food. coffee not so good. flavored rice is okay. Price a bit on the higher side for quantity
5
Great place to enjoy Indian vegetarian food. Food is heat and the ordering And delivery is really fast and efficient. Across between sit down dining and quick service. Everything seems to be priced at $5. Very clean and new, as well.
4
wanted something of my taste... walked into this restaurent randomly.. was not disapointed. was ok for a moderate taste person like me
5
Place to have authentic South Indian food in little India area of Singapore.
Ordered special thali which is more then enough for a individual in terms of quantity.
Cleanliness if impeccable.
5
Best restaurant for south Indian food.... specially their wada and idly are awesome. ... not to forget meals
4
Good Kannada fare : neat, clean, fast service and crowded! The Rava Idli and the Podi Masala Dosa are great. Loved the chutney's but personally found the sambhar not up to rest of the food.
4
MTR is a popular South Indian restaurant from the silicon valley of Indian city called Bangalore. In 1990s, they use to serve lunch and dinner in silver plates and glass. Their authentic taste of south Indian food is exquisite and delicious. Now open in Singapore in Little India (opp to Perumal Temple) now you can taste the Bangalore food in Singapore which some what take away your home sickness. Pamper yourself with tasty pudi masala dosa, bisi bele bath, masala dosa with jaggery sweet sambhar & end your dining with a hot filter coffee
5
I have been to MTR innumerable times, have never been disappointed once.The service is quick- the place clean.I recommend to try all their dishes atleast once but bear in mind that they heavy on Ghee. :-)My favourites as Khara Bhath, Rava Idly, Avalakki Bhath and plain dosa!
2
Visited for dinner with a friend at his recommendation. Not the best place to go for dinner. It was like a fast food place with quick service. Food was with Indian and authentic but served like a low class cafeteria. Will not go there again, sorry
5
Good and tasty food that came fairly quickly, opposite a temple too, works out nicely, staff are also nice, went with the whole family, worth going to
5
The best Indian food we ever had. The masala dosa (signature dish) with spicy potatoe is delicious. Even I can't eat too spicy it was really nice. My boyfriend had tomatoe rice which was scrumptious! It's worth a visit.
5
This small restaurant completes urge of stomach & soul. This place is always packed and your might need to wait for delicious and economical delicacies.
4
Offers excellent south indian food .Typical mysore choices are mouth watering. . Choice place for Indians as well locals. Filter coffee to tpp up dosas vadas and other snacks a must.
5
Food is great, service is nice and more over they keep the quality everytime the same. Though have to wait for a long time to get a seat however its worth waiting.
3
Average food and pricey for the quality. Very complicated system of ordering. You have to order at the cashier before being seated. It looks very crowded and there is no privacy. Overrated for the quality of food
5
Arguably the best economical veggie food in town. Amazing food, great quality and reasonable prices. Have been here numerous times and will do many more times as well
4
Superb taste and authentic Bangalore style.. Better than in Bangalore. I recmond to all and must visit if you visit Serangoon road..
4
Tasty South Indian food, served with passion. The atmosphere is that of a typical South Indian restaurant. A little pricey but the quality of the food is superb. A must visit restaurant in Serangoon Road. Don't miss it!
4
If you want authentic South Indian fare, MTR is the place to go. Yummy bisibelabath, Super creamy Pongal, a differently sweet curd vada - all with the Karnataka twist. The place gets very crowded on weekends and getting a place to sit may be difficult. They should move into a bigger place
4
Excellent food. Akki roti, bhath, pudina rice were excellent. Idli was good but nothing can beat Murgan idli. Dosa was average.
5
If you are from Bangalore, this restaurant will hit the spot. Very fresh food in a friendly and local atmosphere.
5
The food here is authentic ,fresh & tasty , being a south Indian myself I can vouch for it . Sunday lunch is the best .
5
Perfect South Indian food. Same taste of MTR Bangalore. Must try this if you like South Indian very hygiene food. Coffee is also very good and at par with MTR Bangalore
5
You cannot go wrong with MTR. Reasonably prized 20 dollars for 2 people. Must visit. The Idlis are delicious. Can get crowded on the weekend. Ample space .
3
It's too expensive for people travelling on a budget. Food was Ok but the portions were small. Also the place was bit over-crowded.
5
This place has many small additional touches - such as a more comprehensive menu, and older ways of serving than others. So the overall experience is enhanced. But if this is your first experience with South Indian food, the nuances might be lost and any other restaurant is equally good (most have great basic fare anyways). The negative is that it has to be a speedy meal - the place is for "eating" (gosh who would think that restaurants are for THAT!!!) - one cannot have luxurious lunches with friends reminiscing over old times - as there are always other people waiting for a seat. The food is also priced at the "just a meal" experience rather than the "rent space to chat with friends" price. Overall a great place EVEN for South Indian food connoisseurs
5
Best vegetarian Indian food in SIngapore. Food is delicious. The menu is not at all pricey, and I always end up ordering not just one but few items just for myself. Surprisingly, I never felt heavy after eating also. Bisibelebath is a must order.. Other Karnataka specialities like neer dosa, rava dosa, rava idly, Akki roti are all great also.. Things to Note:1. Few special items are only on specific times... like Sunday lunch or Saturday lunch..2. Queue is little too much for weekend lunch, so going early would help you beat the crowd
5
MTR is located near Kitchener Road and is opposite a Hindu temple. There's limited parking and one option is to park at the nearby mall, City Square Mall, and walk over. MTR is usually crowded in the evenings and especially when the nearby temple services are on. Notwithstanding, the turnover is fast and one can usually get a table after a 10-minute wait. The menu at MTR is interesting. They have regular items that are available daily and specials that are only available on certain days. The food is so good that I've found myself planning my return on different days just to try the different specials available on each of those days. I would recommend the Mango Lassi - nice sweet and cool drink to temper that spicy meal. You can also consider having the Marsala tea, which is great at the end of a meal
4
Truth-be-told, I don't eat much Indian food in Singapore, but a recent trip to MTR1924 has changed my perspective. An spotlessly clean Indian chain restaurant, the restaurant is a 3-5 min walk from the Farrer Park MRT.The signature Dosas are great, hearty with a kind of cheeziness that really sticks to your stomach. The service was excellent and the staff was more than willing to offer friendly suggestions to the uninitiated
4
Indian goodness that is worth every dollar you've worked hard for... just always try to be in the company that you love.... they give the food and just enjoy your peers with the promise of a filled satisfied tummy!
5
Restaurant is located in the little india not far from metro station. Kindly personal help you to choose meal. Inside you will feel like in 5 stars restaurant but prices are much lower. Everything what i ate was delicious and tasty.
5
Sumptuous and authentic food served here. Enjoyed the food with my family. I recommend every body to try this healthy restaruant that has tested food ingredients for better hygiene and taste. Overall this restaurant is absolutely amazing!
5
Excellent food and hospitality. All family members from 10 yr old to 84 yr old enjoyed the food that was prepared meticulously and served with warmth and love. Hope to see MTR in Sydney too!!
5
WOW. Such wonderful food. I had the Bisibele Bhath and Kharabhath. Both perfect. Something about the food here that warms your heart and makes you feel at home. Will be back many times for sure.
5
We had a great time at MTR while visiting Singapore. We were starving for some good indian food after a stint in Thailand for many days. Kids were looking forward as well and we ended up at MTR. The food reminded us of India MTR and taste was very similar as well. Enjoyed it so much we came back to Lunch again in a few days..The manager took care of us so well, Believe his name was Rajesh. Recommed highl
5
This is by far the best South Indian restaurant in Singapore and the food can be best described as culinary magic . The dosas are thick yet crisp and taste divine . Definitely a must visit place if you are crazing for authentic South Indian cuisine in the heart of Singapore .
4
The food at this restaurant is very much suitable for people who want to eat Karnataka ( India) delicacies. The place is located on Serangoon Road , close to MRT. The place is always crowded and has waiting period in peak hours. But the premises is a far cry from it's Bangalore outlets in terms of ambience and taste
5
Originally came here after seeing the high ratings at TripAdvisor, and as soon as we tried the food we understood why.It was my first time trying Idli and Masala Dosa, and I fell in love with them right away. They made your foods right after you order them, so everything was fresh from the stove. The taste made me wish that all vegetarian foods are as delicious!We loved our first visit so much that we ended up going there 2 more times. We usually dined there before their day break, so it was not too crowded though there were always other customers
5
This is my second time I have eaten at MTR, would be more often but it is often crowded when I show up. Got in quickly this week and ordered an assortment of the $5 items. As always, just amazing! Service is outstanding and good quality is the best
5
Lovely nestled in a part of Little India is this place serving exactly the same taste as in Bangalore.was thrilled.But only regret went a bit late so some items were not available.
4
But on the famous South Indian model MTR offers quality South Indian food at reasonable prices though a tad more than ethnic Singapore Indian restaurants
Items to try include Neer Thosai Kanchipuram and Rava idli and filter coffee
4
MTR serves fantastic Tamil vegetarian food prepared with fresh ingredients. The food quality is superb and one of the best in Singapore.
The restaurant is very easy to get to on Serangoon Road. Service was prompt even on a busy Sunday evening.
Definitely recommended!
5
Despite the busy lunch hour, Mr Rao went thru the menu to recommend the dishes as we were not familiar with the Indian vegetarian dishes... Not only the dishes were fantastic, the service too!
5
This serves without doubt the best South Indian food in Singapore. The crowd is a issue on the weekends but the food is worth the wait.
4
I visited MTR along with family after my visit to perumal temple.
It is quite busy place. We waited about 20 mins to get table.
Food is amazing.
real authentic Tamil flavor.
worth visiting with family.
cost is abit high but worth of taste.
5
MTR is a place where you get sumptous and authentic south-indian food. Like to visit this place again and again. There is no better place than this. Once you go to MTR you will forget the other restaurants offering this food. It is the best place to visit and has the flavour of India.
5
So, I'm hanging wth my dear cousins for breakfast this morning. Already an awesome start to the day! My cousin suggests we go to MTR instead of the usual American breakfast. He says we won't be disappointed. We get there at 10am. There's a queue, but to my pleasant surprise manager and staff are cheerful and efficient. In less than 10 min, we place or orders and get our table. Restaurant is so clean. You can clearly see service and cleanliness is top priority. Food comes, shortly... Piping hot. We got carried away with the orders.... We ordered Rava idli, vada, poori, dosa, coffee and masala tea. OMG, first bite of EVERYTHING and I'm in heaven. You see, I'm a true blue Singaporean. Food is part of our culture and we're proud to say so. But to me, comfort food is crucial. The dosas here are beyond delicious. Perfectly done. Nice crisp on the outside and delightfully soft inside. Best I've ever had. We say... "So shiok!".... translated "Yummy x100". Thrilled that I found my comfort food spot. Very reasonably priced and wonderful food. Will be back here with many family and friends, for sure!!
5
I eat here once or twice per week. The food quality is excellent and very healthy. Prices are very reasonable at about $10 to $15 per head including a drink. The feel of the restaurant is welcoming, casual and homely. Staff are very polite and friendly and service is good
5
We went thr on Saturday as expected the place was full. We managed to find two seats and the food kept coming. Everything we tried was excellent. The dosas were crisp and delicious. If you are in Singapore and craving south Indian food you must visit mt
4
Manager of restaurant helped 3 of us order at a very busy lunch hour.
Food was delicious, well prepared and reasonably priced. Service good.
This will definitely be on my must go to list, every time I return to Singapore.
5
The first thing you will notice in this place is cleanliness.
The next thing is the food taste.
Finally its economical.
What else do we need ??
Note :- Its a south Indian cuisine based restaurant.
5
Enjoyed the dosa - authentic Bangalore style. Apparently they get the ingredients from india, to be able to create the experience.
5
If you want to try authentic South Indian food, MTR is the place to visit. Tiffin, dosa and idlis, many delicious Indian dishes to try. The staff is friendly and takes personal care of customers.
5
Delicious & reasonable food. I am a regular visitor to this place . I have never been disappointed . Staff is very courteous & takes personal care of customers.

I cherish this place..my companions brought me here and I have returned commonly from that point onward. I am not a vegan, but rather i adore veggie lover sustenance. What's more, the nourishment here is damn great if just i recall what i ate.
5
We came here because we're going to go to mustafa to get some groceries. The dosa here is a must. Ask for extra chutney if you fancy them. The lassi are really good too!

A work colleague from Singapore took me to Little India to this terrific little restaurant, MTR. Personally, I really like Indian food but am uncertain what to order. My colleague took over and ordered Masala Dosa, Bisibele Bhath, Akki Roti and Uddin Vada. Of course I had to write these down and take photos as I would never remember what we had. Everything was very good. The owner/manager was very helpful in seating us and answering our questions. The service was also very prompt and courteous. We came for a business lunch and I would highly recommend this for lunch or dinner.I will return, maybe next time with my wife for dinner
5
Try their Neer Dosai. Amazing!! If you have a sweet tooth, try Chandrahara, again an amazing treat. Must visit place but tends to get busy during 7.30 pm to 9 pm. Only glitch, their best items are served only on select days of the week. Perhaps, my definition of best
5
1) The Service at MTR was 8 star. All servers were very courteous. 2) Food was simply awesome. Made to our specifications. Made fresh & delivered within a reasonable time despite the crowds. 3) Atmosphere was decent. A bit noisy though given the crowd. 4) I liked every thing. Maybe the space could be more. They could use an hand-dryer instead of paper napkins. That will save us the trees
5
This MTR outlet, like all it's branches, is reminiscent of tiffin centres in India where food is dished out fast and delicious at affordable prices. Be prepared to wait in line for a long time if you visit on a weekend!

Horrible Pongal: Watery, over spicy and no ghee glowing in it!
Sambar tasted like tomato soup.
below expectation.
5
Whenever i miss home cooked food from my mother in Chennai. This is where i go for authentic South Indian Food. Superb!
5
The same MTR Quality & Taste as you get in Bengaluru, felt @ home after having yummy food @ MTR Singapore
5
We had a stunning time in MTR. It's very well located, close to the Farrer Park MRT station. The selection of South Indian dosas, idlis and other dishes is unmatchable. Staff is extremely courteous. However, the honey lemonade was a bit disappointing. overall, an awesome experience
4
We came here because of the reviews and the lack of reliably vegetarian food in the main eating areas. We were not disappointed! The guy behind the counter made some suggestions, we followed a couple and made a couple decisions ourselves. Everything was delicious, it came out quickly and we were so happy!
4
Awesome amazing experience.lovely food. Ordered sambhar vada, veg bonda, mini meals. That's a lovely combination and each dish did have unique taste.Cleanliness - 4/5Food - 4/5Ambience - 3/5Overall - 4/5Will definitely return again.Tip - if u would like to toast most of the dishes but don't have much appetite, do try their meals combinations. They do cover most of the day's specials
5
This place, hands down, serves the best south Indian food in Singapore. The food quiality is consistent and high. Service is exceptional and prices reasonable.If you are craving South Indian food in Singapore look no further. A must visit for every south Indian food fan! Waiting for my next meal..
5
This is undoubtedly the best restaurant to have Indian food in Singapore. The quality, service and hygiene is unmatched. The best feature of this place is that everyone is treated with hospitality and friendliness irrespective of their nationality. This is a family run restaurant with a rich tradition. The 3 family members who manage the restaurant are very simple,down-to-earth and provide outstanding service to customers just like any other employee in the restaurant which is remarkable. It's very difficult to select which is the best order as each one of them is excellent. The only point to note is that Veg Pulao, Vangi Bhath and Butter Milk are hotter and spicier than it should actually be. I hope this point is taken note of and chilli content is reduced to make these 3 items taste better.The price is slightly higher than other Indian restaurants. However, it's worth paying since it's better in all respects than the other Indian restaurants in the whole of Singapore. In summary, it's a big thumbs up to MTR. Highly recommended
4
Authentic menu and maintaining the traditional taste of South Indian tiffin.Clean and tidy ambience. Don't miss Rawa Idli.However, too small for the large crowd i attracts (specially on weekends). be prepared to be standing in a queue. Unpleasant experience when customers waiting are next to the table.A bit expensive considering the total experience
4
MTR is exceedingly popular in Singapore. There are huge queues of people waiting patiently to dine. Their dosas are different and tasty. Their special South Indian meal is to die for. Service is good too. Value for money.
5
the food is great if you love south indian food. nice spice levels for south indians. been there multiple times and it was great each time. Nice masala dosa if you love dosa.
5
Amazing Indian food. We went back the next night because the food is just so incredible- and so cheap! Definitely a must.
4
Very neat and clean restaurant with authentic food
Not bad service
I loved the Andhra dosa there and the chutneys .
Sambhar could be a bit more hotter though
4
My grand daughter and me went in the evening for dinner and we both loved the food, specially the Vada, the Idli and the set Dosa. The set Dosa consists of 3 pieces of soft and thick pan cake like Dosas, which were different from the Dosa that I'm used to. However they were soft and quite enjoyable. Round it off with a cup of steaming South Indian filter coffee and you are set
4
Location - It is situated on sera goon road which is about 10 mins walk from MustafaFood - is nice and served hot. Their Pudi Masala dosa is amazing and must try. Even their idlis are goodAmbience - It's a simple eatery with ordinary seatingIf you are wanting South Indian food, or even otherwise you should eat out here once . A small caveat though, on weekend there is lot of waiting so reach earl
4
as a bengalurian first of all i felt very happy to be in mtr and have few words with owner in kannada. is simply owesome and delicious food for veggie lovers in singapore, little bit pricey but worth to taste .weekends little bit crowded overall nice visitin
3
This is your normal dosa joint with the same menu and taste you have at your regular place wherever that might be so don't go in thinking you are going to have your taste buds changed. However given the cult following, clean environment and "some indication" of enhanced quality MTR charges a small amount extra than everyone else. Overall the value is still great (this was the cheapest meal we had in Sing by far and we all left full) but there are equally good places around without the uplift is what I mean and they are all nearby within little India such as Ganga Woodlands etc. Food service etc are all much as you expect at a Dosa Joint. but NB they dont put the prices on the menu and you have to order before they seat you! attached picture
5
If you want a quick South Indian meal to spice up your Sunday this small restaurant on Serangoon Road is the perfect place for a delicious idli and ragi dosa. You can go there with a big group or just with a friend it will never let you down. Enjoy
5
I had visited this restaurant purely based on the reviews. I am from chennai and hence i had certain apprehensions in trying out the food at MTR. All these were broken once i tasted their food.Excellent food and quick service. I liked their Masala Dosa and Rava Idli very much.The other thing about MTR is that they are keen to provide variety to their customers by having their daily special items in the menu. I would just like to give a suggestion to them to increase their space a little more to avoid the huge crowds especially in the weekends
4
Good south indian karnataka style food. Very clean with mouthwatering presentation. They have more traditional healthy dosa varieties too but didn't get a chance to try. The place can get crowded in the evening especially on weekends.
4
Another visit, this time for breakfast and another satisfactory experience.
Pongal. Rava idli and dosa all were good . Service was efficient and they immediately provide you your choice of chutneys and sambar.
Definitely stays on "keep visiting" list
5
Eating dosas and idlis there is the best thing one could do. The place looks really small, and there was a long queue when we went there. But, we got our seating very quickly, and the food is excellent.
4
We had breakfast on 8 May 16 at this nice, little restaurant in Serangoon Road. Coming from Bangalore, the home of MTR, we had to find out if this measured up to the high standards of the parent back home. We were gratified to see that they passed the test with flying colours!! We had Puri and set dosas and of course, the trademark MTR filtered coffee. Absolutely not disappointed with the service and the quality of food. Highly recommended for South Indian Vegetarian fare
4
Originating in Bangalore (India) the Mavalli Tiffin Room a.k.a. MTR, continues to serve delicious kannadiga and South Indian food across the Bay of Bengal. You can get top quality South Asian meals for a very affordable price. This is a no-frills dining place, so you order at the counter and are given a number card which you take with you to a table of you choosing (It is often very crowded so sharing tables with fellow patrons is not unusual). The restaurant is very clean and they would promptly clean a table for you which just got vacated. The food service is also swift. Their famous Bisibele Bhath is the star of the menu, but I personally like their Ragi Dosa, Bonda Soup and Rave Idly as well - vegetarian, light, medium-spicy and very satisfying. Do have a cup of Filter Coffee or Masala Tea to finish off the meal. Expect to see long queues outside the restaurant on weekends and public holidays, but since the service is quick one may not need to wait as much. This place is surely worth more than all the pennies you'll spend here
4
This long established restaurant specialises in South India (vegetarian) food. We liked their masala dosa especially. All the dishes were full of flavour and not salty or fatty. The place was spotless, and the staff were all very well presented and very helpful in explaining the dishes.The restaurant is easy to access from Farrer Park subway station (exit H)
5
Rather proud of this restaurant, since they come from my hometown.The dosas, bisi bele bhaath (lentils and rice mixed with spices) and everything else is great. They have thoughtfully kept tissue dispensers on each table. The place itself is so crowded at lunch time, people wait in queues to place their order and pay. If only the managers could welcome their customers with so much as a smile, it would be nice. Some of the waiters smile though! Was surprised how clean their washrooms were. I hope they stay that well maintained every day. Also hope they expand their restaurant area very soon, people queue up outside in the summer sun
4
Nice place, easy to get to (getting a cab from there not too easy, maybe ask them to call one for you), friendly staffâ€“very helpful selecting dishes. Be aware that this is South Indian restaurant (vegetarian) so no Chicken Tikka Makhanwala, etc. That being said, the porridge dishes were excellent (Bisibele Bhath, Kesaribhath, etc.). If eating for dinner, come early. I ordered for a family of five and as I waited the line filled up and out the door (all Indian). They know what they're doing! Enjoy
5
We got there fairly early on a Wednesday night and there were plenty of tables available. The staff was helpful, and its very nice to have a TV screen on the wall showing each dish and describing it in detail. The menu is also thorough and easy to read. You can check on their daily specials online. We had three different kinds of dosa, each of which was delicious. The masala dosa was easily the best I've ever eaten, and I don't know what they do to the potato filling to make it so delicious, but it was really good. The idli left me a little cold, but I don't really like idli anyway. We had an onion uthapam which was quite delicious, with a great contrast between the crispy outside in the soft partially cooked sweet onions inside. Lemon rice was also a winner.The coffee is also well worth trying. I would go here again every week if I was staying in Singapore longer
5
I always thought vegetarian food is boring. Time and time again I've been proven right! Till this time. Had the lunch set- flavoured rice, mini masala dosai, 5 vegetarian dishes all cooked in different ways. 2 poori so much more! The mango lassi is to die for
4
A very good Indian restaurant, much better than some of the ones present in that locality.
The restaurant is usually crowded, so reach the place early evening to avoid waiting for seats.
5
The best part about this restaurant is its food and hospitality.. Plus genuinely priced... Would recommend it to everyone
4
Excellent food .had Idly ,masala dosa and filter coffee. The quality of food was just like back home in India
5
Very nice place, the staff is very courteous, the food is delicious and inexpensive, we had the special thali which was filling delicious and reasonably priced in the special thali it came with a mini masala dosa, the place is a little small and very popular so finding a place during peak hours might be difficult and you might have to wait for a while but trust me its worth i
5
Sunday morning at 8.15 am, the restaurant is not open and no customers outside... 8.40 am, the restaurant ha been open for 10 minutes and there is not a vacant seat to be found... and the rush carries on till they close.MTR offers an uncompromising variety of pure vegetarian food from Bangalore and Mysore.. a taste that brings back so many memories... a combination of flavours that explode in your mouth.The best way to start a Sunda
5
While our short visit of Singapore we were searching for a South Indian Restaurant which was easily located near our hotel.It was about 3 pm when their time was to close down but manager has instructed to take our order and served immediately the tasty items
5
Speedy service. The best Vada I have ever eaten and a delicious masala dosa. Huge, fluffy, crispy, delicious. Just like or even better than what I have had in India and at home-cooked South Indian meals. As the only non-Indian diner at the time, the staff and even other customers jumped in to make sure I knew what everything was and what foods to combine. Incredibly friendly place and easy to find - well-labeled on Serangoon Road. Impossible to miss it
4
When you enter the restaurant, it's a total feast to your senses. It's very clean and well maintained, you are always greeted with a smile. The smell of traditional authentic South Indian food is Devine , but it's not just the smell , the sizzle of the fresh masala dosa and onion rava dosa , the aroma of crispy fresh vada when it mixes with sambar , the smell of masala tea or a filter coffee, the super softness of the idli , it's a happy environment to see people happy as they treat themselves to a well deserved meal . The food is amazing and best of all it's always fresh ,one thing is for certain, there's no compromise on quality. It's a must try for locals and visitors!Enjoy , V
5
most of the food with potatoes are great, such as the masala dosa the fried potato balls with curry or dippings are good too. Do try their filtered coffee or lassi too, sometimes the lassi sells out too quickly, especially the mango lassi. Remember to not try the butter milk unless you are in for some serious mind blowing palate in your mouth. The staff are really friendly and attentive, very hygenic in how they handle and serve food as well. Overall I and my friends spent $43 for 4 pax as we order additional potato balls and masala dosa
5
We finally found the comfort place to enjoy our dosa, vadai, idli when we crave for them in Singapore. MTR is air-conditioned, hygenic, provides great service with a smile. The food is so delicious that I am looking forward to my next visit. They taste authentic like the ones served in India. They are generous to provide extra servings of their delicious sambhar and chutney whenever requested. Once you enter, please browse the menu, queue to give your order at the counter, upon payment you will be assigned a number and your table. The turnover is fast and the food arrives soon so please do not be turned off by the long queue you see at the door. They also serve complimentary water along with the food. Their menu is comprehensive but please note that not all the items are served daily. You may have to return on a weekday to eat those items
4
Very crowded during weekends. Food is good but pricy which seems to be normal for Indian vegetarian restaurants in Singapore.
4
MTR has managed to keep the same taste as in Bangalore. My favorite is Set Dosai and Chow Chow Bath.
5
Being a south India this is my go to place when I miss home food and don't wanna cook. I like MTR here better than the Bangalore one.
5
Bessibeli Bhaat and Rawa Idly is a must try ! Limited food choices but quality and taste is excellent.
5
I make sure to visit MTR during my trip to Bangaluru often. They joy of taste is a very special ingredient in their cooking. There oldest restaurant is busy all the time and people Q for their seats that may even take an hour or more sometimes. This is the 1st time in Singapore, I visited with my family on call by my brother-In-Law. Till I reach their, I didn't know that we are dinning at MTR. It was a real surprise by my BIL, and really enjoyed the food
4
MTR is clean & has good food. But I would be skeptical awarding it the best vegetarian restaurant in SG. It has authentic south Indian food, which is offered by very few 'clean' places here. But still, I do not appreciate the hype or the queues during the weekend
5
After a good Darshan @ the Srinivasa Perumal Temple near Farrer Park station, we had a lovely satisfying dinner @ MTR which is just bang opposite to the temple . We have been regular to the MTR and once again the food was delicious. If you love the Bangalore sambhar and dishes , then this is the place to visit as the sambhar is deliciously different from other south indian sambhar .Family members Visited : 5 We had ordered and shared few items and so you will see a range of items mentioned in this review .Rava iddlies ( which were bit on the costly side but still gives immense pleasure ) Rava dosai ( relatively smaller size from other hotels but crisp ) Veg bonda ( crispy hot huge ones ) Neer Dosa ( sunday special item which was delicate and well made and went well with the coconut scraped sweet side dish , along with the sagu and chutney ) .The poori was okay nothing great about it The bisebela bath was hot and spicy and was wonderful to have with the ghee and raitha Curd vada's were relatively more sweeter Tea was okay could have been better as i make better tea that what was served :) Overall food was great and portions were good . Service was prompt and fast . Extra's ( chutney / sambhar ) asked were given quickly and promptly Hotel opening hours in the evening was 5:30 pm only and so if you go around 6:30 pm it was just nice post which it was more crowded till 7:30 pm Overall a good dinner if you love south indian food CheersKarthi
5
I would give MTR a 5 star rating as the food is excellent, the service is great and above all the place is kept super clean!! Go here to experience Bangalore style food. The thali is sumptuous and always reminds me of a feast cooked on festivals or at kannadiga weddings :) As a family we go here regularly and to date have never had an occasion when we have had poor service or bad food!
5
This is not the first time I have been here - which tells how good the place is. The Masala Dosa is just awesome - makes me wonder how they manage to consistently pull off the exact same taste every time. We had our all time favorite Poori Saagu, set dosa and Kaara Bath. The poori sagu is quite unique here in that the poori is made from real whole wheat flour, instead of maida, and sans the dripping cheap oil they fry the pooris elsewhere. Saturdays are particularly crowded and we ended up realizing that the food was particularly appetizing that I needed one more Podi Masala Dosa. Although I had to wait for about 15 min, owing to the crowd, it was worth every second of the wait
4
I went to the place for having good food and thats what I got. The dishes I tried - Bisibelibath, rawa idli, pudi dosa - all good. The ambiance of the place is not upscale but that was the expectation I went with. The prices were also nominal. So, go to this place for good food. If you are looking for a quite romantic place, then find some place else as this place is going to be crowded because of good food they offer at nominal prices
4
The only Bangalorean restaurant in Little India, with delicious specialties you won't find anywhere else. Their idli is to die for.
5
Visited this restaurant with family.
As my family aware of this chain of restaurants, glad been there,
Tried every dish , very high standard of taste and preparation .
Will visit again MTR
5
Visited many times in recent past, it's one of the best Indian Vegetarian Restaurants around the area in Singapore. Highly recommended for family and friends.
4
This is a good Indian restaurant in Indian area.The food is good and tasty. The service is good.The prices similar to other ones.
5
Have been eating here today. And I liked that the restaurant was crowded with only local indian people. The food was amazing. Different than all the other indian restaurants I have visited during my travels through SEA there is only south indian food. Not always paneer or aloo gobi, naan etc. And they have only vegetarian dishes. Perfect. Go there if you want to try sth. different
5
Being South Indian, I always had a bone to pick with what was passed off as Udipi fare in Singapore. Until my lunch today at MTR. This is one restaurant that lives up to the reputation of its flagship at Bangalore. The ambience is clean but no-frills; the staff courteous and at hand; but the food is - Great!Being my first time, I tasted a few dishes - the Podi Masala Dosa, Set Dosa, Kurma, Sambhar and the Kesari baat were all terrific. The filter coffee was alright - get a better brew at home! But that was just a minor blemish in an otherwise perfect mealCan see myself being a regular there - when I am in the vicinity and feel like a quick dose of homely comfor
5
After visiting, Sri Srinivasa Perumal temple at Singapore,on the morning of 12th February 2016 we were badly in need of breakfast. To our surprise we could find MTR Restaurant opposite to the temple at Serangoon Road. We immediately rushed in. All the south Indian tiffins were available and we ordered whatever we want. Dosa was yummy. In Bengaluru we had visited MTR many times. What quality of food prevails at Bengaluru the same quality is being maintained here also. The restaurant is very neat and clean. Above all the service is good. The filter coffee was excellent. In fact we did not have filter coffee for the past two days since our arrival at Singapore. This coffee re freshened us and made our day. Very tasty food on par with MTR of Bengaluru. The price is al.so very reasonable. thanks MTR.Singapore.
5
This is a branch of the Venerable MTR restaurant of Bangalore, and there is no difference in the quality, of the food they serve here even their filter coffee (as against the nescafe instant coffee) tastes exactly like the one you get in Bangalore! A word of warning to the uninitiated, coffee in India comes mixed with a lot of milk! If you want black coffee, you better inquire first before you order.I do love going there from breakfast, if you go early enough its easy to walk right in and find a table. That said the turnover is pretty good so even a wait wont be longer than 10-15 odd minutes during rush hour.Their vada (like a savoury fried lentil doughnut) sambar set is always crisp, freshly made and never fails to please. Same for their dosas. You may not get the range of food which in available in similar restaurants, but I'll take MTR any day, simply for the quality of food
5
Wow. If you're reading this, just stop now and go. We may fly back to Singapore just go go here.Still here? I'll make this short so you can get to MTR faster. The staff is awesome, the place is filled with locals, and the food was absolutely incredible. And it's cheap. What more do you need?Go. Seriously it's that good
5
I've been long since converted to the idea that meat doesn't add anything to curry so was very excited about checking this place out.Went to South India last month and this was as good as anything I had there. It was quite busy (the restaurant, not India), but not with tourists but we quickly got a table. Had the uncomfortable special treatment of table service as we were clearly tourists, but that being said the chap who served us gave us some good recommendations. He also really wasn't keen on me ordering the poori, which I really wanted, not sure why, but I eventually gave in. Ordered about 5 dishes between 2 of us and it was just the right amount. The dosa's were definitely the best bit. (Even better than the incredibly low price).If you like Indian this is a must. If you don't and you are still reading, hopefully I've convinced you
2
Not sure why this restaurant gets so much praise. The food was only average, prices are not indicated in the menu, which should always set an alarm for any savvy traveler... Definitely better places to eat in Singapore.
5
The best place in town for an authentic South Indian food! Fresh and tasty! Set Dosa is my favourite!
4
MTR is Very Good South Indian Food, an ordinary Udupi sort eatery/taste. Masala Dosa significant other must attempt this spot. All that much suggested. Huzayf
5
Crisp fixings, they serve diverse dishes ordinary. dinner crisply make upon request. I can eat this each feast. They are close on Monday, do note their opening hours as well. Eat well, we just have one body.
5
A great local restaurant out of the main hub of Little India but still on the main drag. The food was delicious and the service excellent. Clean food, healthy eating...
5
Food all very nice .. Prices or very responsible and it's very good South Indian veg food .. Service also quit good but can improve the service better for rich people ..
5
We are regular at this place which is bang opposite Perumala Temple. Excellent veg food. Not oily and very easy on stomach. Clean and very courteous staff. All the items are very tasty (we have tried almost all of them). Real value for money
4
The taste of all the food brings back the memories of local restaurants in Bangalore. The crispy, ghee-fried dosa and the chutney. The slightly grainy texture but soft idlis ( typical of idlis in Karnataka) with piping hot and crispy vada both to be dunked in the typical- slightly sweetish/spicy sambar . The famous chow-chow bath -combination of the savory upma and sweet sheera ) yum! .The signature Rava idli with ghee and potato sago tempered with hing to give sagoo distinctive flavor and not forget the set dosa, rava dosa ,pongal etcFinally a hot-strong filter coffee to end the meal
5
Every time, we've been to MTR, we have had the best of experience: seating is good, the restaurant is clean and spick & span, the toilets are superbly clean, hygienic, look well taken care of - surprising for an Indian outfit!The food - and we have tried out all the different dishes of the different days in the week - is freshly made & hot, you can smell the pure ghee in the dosas and how delectably is the ghee served, in a little miniature stainless steel bowl. Long, long time ago - probably, in the 80's - I used to go to the original MTR in Bangalore, had to stand in the queue early in the morning and I remember the delicious, pure Udipi style food,freshly made, served piping hot. I am happy to say that the same taste, same hot & delicious food now comes to our veryown Singapore with the MTR at Serangoon Road. What is more, the managers & the staff are a smiling, well-serving lot. Could we find anything to complaint: NOTHING! God bless MTR and God bless its staff
4
Visited for lunch last Saturday and enjoyed the typical S Indian cuisine they serve. The restaurant is very simple but clean and it's more of a no fuss kind of place. They serve food which is typical of the state of Karnataka in Southern India. We had the weekend set lunch which is a whole meal in itself with curries, rice & bread. Very tasty. Also known for its dosas , idli etc. the Bisi Bele rice is fabulous. A must try Of course the restaurant is a pure vegetarian one.
5
Very good vegetarian restaurant with authentic indian food. The only drawback was having drunk a large cup of coffe with milk at the end of the meal, when I was dreaming with an expresso!
5
MTr is a famous restaurant in the south of India And now in Singapore. almost every item on their menu has an authentic flavor. Vegetarian fate. Don't miss their neer dosa :)
5
Must go for their Bisibhele Bhat n Ragi Dosa 😋😋
Neat n clean, ambience could be better with more spaces.
3
portions are really small. service is not customer oriented. food quality is good. it was a bit crowded during the weekends.
5
Great South Indian (Karnataka) food. Enjoyed the yummy Masala dosa and Rava Idli. Don't miss their bisi Bela bath with ghee
4
Tasty vegetarian food in a clean environment. Service ok, due to labor shortage.
Not crowded. Bit expensive.
5
This restaurant was amazing. They have all vegetarian, authentic South Indian food with a lot of variety. Every dish we tried was very good, our favourite one being Pudi Masala Dosa. This restaurant is located very near to one MRT. We used to have our food almost daily here during our stay
5
We love vegetarian south Indian cooking and MTR has excellent chefs. Every dish we tried was delicious. OK it is not a fancy place, but the staff are friendly and help you choose. The Marsala Dhosa was the best ever. Also you will not believe how little you have to pay
3
The hotel serves south Indian and North Indian dishes too. If you are a Karnataka person you will enjoy the cuisine like Rava Dosa, Rava Idli , Ragi Dosa etc. It is located on Serangoon road,close to Mustafa Shopping Mall. Be careful there is heavy rush at peak hours and you may having waiting time running into 10/15 minutes.
4
This restaurant is a branch of a small chain from Bangalore in India. Food served is typical vegetarian of Bangalore with slight concession to Singaporean taste, such as the chutnies served with the dosais.Quality is excellent as is the service. Ambience is that of a cafe indulged in the serious business of eating. It is not a place you would chose for a business lunch or romantic dinner - I think they close rather early.Excellent food, excellent service. Steer clear of the coffee and tea though. Unless you're into the typical Indian versions of those drinks - tea or coffee flavoured boiled milk with the optional addition of spice
5
I am big fan of MTR Bangalore and it was really good to find the same quality and taste as Bangalore MTR in Singapore.
4
Service was Good and food was tasty. Perfect source for Indian food and Ambience was hygienic and food was serviced hot and quick and the token number to be carried with you to table was a new.
5
Superb place, amazing food, great pricing, friendly owners, a new dish everyday. Overall a brilliant experience
4
One of the finest veg good place.. next to mustafa center. We tried the veg briyani and it was amazing.. the rava dosa was another dish which we liked. the taste of sambhar was very good.
they charged us for podi chutney..which was unfair
3
Wanted to visit MTR after great reviews and the history of serving delicious South Indian food. The place is very neat and clean, but can be quite crowded on weekends. We tried the dosa and bisibella rice which were good. The idli and sambhar was just o
5
Was lucky enough to decide to stop at this place for a early dinner. Being a vegetarian place that is highly ranked over here, I had high expectations for this joint and it did not disappoint.The dosas were thick but crispy and the chutney went well with it. In fact we ordered another. The Rava dosa was lighter and was crispy and so was the Poori with Potato.Price was also not too bad for Singapore. Definitely worth a repeat visit an we will oblige when we are in the area
5
All vegetarian, at a reasonable price (compared to other places in Singapore, which is a utterly expensive place!), very tasty food and very clean space (probably the cleanest toilet I've been, since arriving in SE asia..!).Overall a great place with high standard service. Definitely recommend!
5
We heard this place being highly recommended on the radio by a local Celebrity Chef and we were not disappointed. It is a very well known South Indian pure vegetarian chain of restaurants that has ventured overseas and retains its very high standards for quality food and snacks. Service was very courteous and standards of hygiene seemingly very high for such restaurants. A well put together illustrated menu is very useful in describing the offerings for those who are not so familiar with South Indian foods

We visited MTR twice, once on a quiet weekday morning, and once on a crowded Saturday at lunchtime. The Saturday was crowded, understandably, but the line was orderly and we got a table as soon as we placed our order. Ordering and payment is done at the counter, before seating, so it's a good idea to check the menu online. Service both times was excellent. We've tried the dosas, wada, idlis, bisi bele baath. All good. Coffee is excellent. Mango lassi is great, but a bit filling after a snack or meal. We've not tried the thalis but they looked interesting, on the other tables. Have to go on a fairly empty stomach to do justice I guess.
5
We ate there several times (breakfast, but it's not like a typical Western breakfast).Helpful and courteous staff (foreign visitors seem to be given extra help, explaining the menu and suggesting things to try). The filter coffee was good but not great, the mango lassi and all food items were great
5
Great south indian food with amazing service. Been there countless of times and always had an awesome experience
5
Fantastic food , good ambience and great service. The quality of the food is 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼Love going here. If you love South Indian food, you should visit MTR!!
5
Delicious, simple, Southern Indian, vegetarian food, with excellent, friendly, helpful service. I recommend this place highly. 10/10.
4
This restaurant was recommended by Indians friends, it was a pleasant surprise, classic south Indian cuisine, very well prepare. Need to mention the very helpful and patient service. They took time to explain dishes.
We will be back soon
4
Very friendly and well priced with some quality authentic dishes including kharabhath and Kesaribhath (savoury/sweet semolina) and beautiful dosa & chutney.
Excellent picture menu with set daily specials and helpful staff.
A short walk from Farrer Park MRT station on the NE line.

Good Hygenic South Indian
food with prompt service.
A delight for Vegetarians!!!
The Quality of food served also good and nice overall experience for a meal...
5
This restaurant deserves the accolades. It's something a bit different in Singapore which either features world class food at astronomical prices or fairly average food at prices higher than those found around Asia. MTR has tradition and authenticity, bags of it. It's a simple cafe style layout and the service is quick. The servers help you out with your choices and being a southern Indian restaurant the dishes are slightly different to your usual Indian restaurant. I visited twice in the space of 3 days and if you follow advice from the staff on what to order you can't go wrong. The cost is very reasonable, especially by Singapore standards. I would always head here when in Singapore
5
I've eaten Dosa all over southern India and London's south Indian restaurants and MTR's is on another level. Even their lassi is better than I've had anywhere else. This is the best place I ate in Singapore, well above either Marina Bay Sands or the hawkers markets
5
This is the best of all south Indian restaurants in Singapore. I stayed in Singapore for a week and tried many restaurants near Little India, MTR is the best and event he second best is very distant. Went there many times during my stay, for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Get very crowded and long waiting during peak lunch hour. Of course, it is worth the wait. It is clean and hygienic too.Recommended: Masala Dosa, Rava Idly, South Indian Coffee, Bisi bele bathAll the waiters and the cashier are very courteous and friendly
4
Food: 9/10 excellent! Very unfamiliar looking sort of menu. Most items Ive never heard of before. We went with a popular dish called Masala Dosa and its a must try. Food here is also cheapService: 8/10 service was friendly. They lacked a little energy and enthusiasm. We got there 5mins before they opened and they allowed us in and seated us which was niceAmbience: 9/10 quite a clean restaurant and modern looking.
5
This is very Hygenic and Authentic South Indian Food. I eat here and feel like home food. Highly Recommended
5
Discover the dosa and more for the first time. It is like a crepe. Delicious. The place is busy with locals.
It's clean and well run. It is a bit small but worth the wait. Be patient.
5
What amazing food! The Masala Dosa is a house specialty and it is little wonder why. Especially recommended for those travelling cheap but still should be visited by others as well.
5
The food is fresh. Service is excellent. A good value for money. A must visit. if you like south indian food this place Very much recommended,
Friendly Staff.... Perfect Location.....Good Ambiance makes it a pleasent typical indian restaurant.
4
We spent a very tasty moment,and were friendly helped in our choice ,the mango and milk drink hwas delicious
Nice location close to the subway
Quite affordable and original
5
What a find!!! A great place with lovely staff and the most delicious food. I am a lover of South Indian food and I have high standards for it. But this place exceeded those standards by far. It was lovely. Their idli was to die for and their dosa was great too. The staff helped to explain menus and were happy to bring extras. The place was clean and tidy and was welcoming. I also loved the coconut chutney. Definite place to visit if you're in Singapore.
5
Excellent food with fine quality and good taste.Food standard was well maintained similar to the MTR restaurant in Bangalore.We enjoyed all the items(Masala Dosa,Chow Chow bath,Rava Idli,Bisibele bath & the hot beverages like tea & coffee) that we ordered with perfect service.Economic and good choice for the people looking out for the Indian food in Singapore
5
What I don't know about Indian cuisine could fill libraries. But I do know what tastes good and satisfies my palette. I needed the picture menu to order, but I wasn't deterred. Ordered 4 dishes and the Tuesday "special" + coffee for S$17. The chutney, mint, and curry sauces were outstanding, food was made to order and delivered hot, service was scary efficient; and even though it's vegetarian food, this carnosaur will be back again! Kudos to MTR
5
Enjoyed the food very much and the ambiance was very good. The restaurent management was very accommodating and offered to hold the shopping bags for us. Very good tasty food and will recommend for all tourists. It is also opposite the Sri Venkateswara temple in Little India and behind the city mall
5
It's our third time there and we just love it ! We wanted to try something different but our European mouth was not used to, and the waiter offered us an other choice of dish on the menu even after eaten it !! What a GREAT service ! The rest of the food was delicious and tasty as always..We will come back, for sure !
4
MTR is Very Good South Indian Food, a typical Udupi type restaurant/taste. Masala Dosa lover must try this place. Very much recommended. Huzayf
5
Great authentic food...reminds me of the place I grew up in Bangalore. Bisibele Baath tastes perfect...nice dosas and coffee too!
5
This restaurant is always busy and with good reason. The food is excellent and fresh and the service is quick and friendly.
Also its very good value for money.
A must visit if you're vegetarian, and even if you're not.
4
That hot food.. Quick servings.... Friendly Staff.... Perfect Location..... Makes up to the best restaurant... The food was amazing. Best place to try South Indian. Only problem is long waiting queues .
5
A local friend introduced me to MTR on my first visit. I've been here 3 times now and the food is always fresh and delicious.
You will regret it if you don't try the Rava Idli
5
They served some amazing food, with great service! The food came to us very quicku and it was fresh and hot! Would love to visit it again!
5
Delicious South Indian food. I had the snacks...the Khara bath, masala dosa and neer dosa and everyone of them was yummy.I grew up frequenting their timeless restaurant in Bangalore and am thrilled they have a restaurant in SingaporeI am looking forward to visiting again and trying out the meals 
5
Best Indian food in singapore. No question about it. I had amazing Bonda Soup, Dosa & filter coffee. Learnt that MTR founder Yajnanarayana Maiya travelled Europe in 1951 to study food & restaurant scene there. Impressed by the hygiene, quality & visual appeal of the foods there, he implemented all these qualities in his new restaurant called Mavalli Tiffin Room (MTR) in Bangalore, south India. He also invented Rava Idli and the unquestionable King of South Indian sweet, Chandrahara. A must visit to every singapore tourist.
5
Let me tell you guys I am not too fond of south indian food and for me south indian food will be last on my to do list but trust me you wont regret having south indian dishes here. Quality of the food is awesome and it remind me of true authentic taste of south indian food especially idlis and dosas
5
I visit singapore often and on every visit I often visit MTR near city square mall in little india. I have visited MTR in banglore and can say for sure away from home you get the same taste .An idli Vada and coffee cost 2 dollars each other snacks for around 5 dollars and south Indian thali around 10 dollars. I highly recommend this place for all lovers of south Indian food.but on weekends early birds get breakfast and lunch others have to wait.It is closed on Mondays and between 3 and 5 pm 
5
Fresh ingredients, they serve different dishes everyday. meal freshly make upon order. I can eat this every meal. They are close on Monday, do note their opening hours too. Eat well, we only have one body 🙏🏼
4
Great food in the heart of Little India.
Very clean, and very inexpensive. We shared a dosa and a meal and we had loads
4
A rather small restaurant with great vegetarian food. The prices are reasonable.
Been coming for a while. Always good. Will keep coming as long as I'm in Singapore.
5
It was great food and embience very good service and facilities to experience nice food and beverages to have
5
We have lunch 2 days ago and were very satisfied with the foods. We had Bisibele Bhath, Rava Idly, a Vada and 2 Masala Tea. The staff were polite and the restaurant is clean and neat. Will definitely visit again.
4
After prayers at a temple opp to MTR, we four adults and two kids went to the restaurant. We ordered Set-Dosa, Masala Dosa, Poori Sagu, Payasam. All these were very good. Idli was so so. It worked out to S$12/person. Recommend this restaurant even to non-Indians who wish to try Indian snacks
5
We have breakfast here every Saturday or Sunday. The restaurant is always full and can get quite noisy. As it the quality is always excellent this restaurant now ranks as one of Singapore's best. However please keep in mind that this place serves South Indian (Karnataka!) style veg-food that is not meant as a fine-dining or something one would choose for an evening out. Food is typically quickly consumed after a temple or on the way to somewhere. MTR is an institution in Bangalore where the food originates from. For foodies who are familiar with masala dosas and idli-vadai it may be nice to know that the sambhar you are served here differs from the Tamil style variety in that a small bit of jaggery is used.
5
Mouth watering starts when u view the menu card pictures. Rava Idli is their signature dish. I ordered Masala dosa which was good but the bonda soup was salty! Filter coffee was excellent. It is a bit inconvenient to pay first and order at the counter before you can have a seat. if you are alone it is fine but with family it is quite inconvenient. Hope they can sort this out as there is lack of space at the entrance. it can get very crowded on weekends
5
This restaurant has great reviews on tripadvisor and deservedly so. we ate here twice and you order at the counter and the food is usually ready within 10 minutes, there are a number of tables here, but turn around is very quick even when the restaurant is busy, we were lucky to get seated immediately both times, but having seen people wait for a table- the waiting time is only ever about 10 minutes or less.The staff are very helpful and can recommend dishes, the menu is quite small but the set meals and mini menu meals offer great value with a number of small dishes of a variety of curries, indian bread and rice and a dessert. the lassi was great and i would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes indian food, although i am not a vegetarian, i was very happy with the quality and flavours of the food here
3
MTR Restaurant requires customers to queue up at the Entrance before the Order/Payment Counter. You will need to pickup a Menu Card from the Counter & decide your Choice of fare while you & your party are on their feet. At the counter you will have to wait till a Table is free & thereafter you can walk in & be seated. The Food is nothing spectacular to write home about. Overall, only diehard MTR Fans would consider a Repeat visit
5
Set dosa, rava idli, and coffee are must try. Food was amazing and service was quick. we loved the place.
5
The place is very close to Farrer Road MRT. It makes it easy to go there and have awesome food. I really liked Pudi Masala Dosa. I highly recommend all visiting singapore to visit this place. Best Veg food overall.
4
I Ordered Idli Dosa and It was Amazing with South Indian Touch ! Fast delivery, Superb Taste, Full Hygiene, 100% Satisfaction. Recommended Restaurant.
5
We loved the food at MRT restaurant! Really tasty and fresh! The stuff was very friendly and explained all the different dishes to us. The prices are totally fine. Definitely would recommend the restaurant.
5
Quality of food was fantastic and service level was excellent. Staff were very friendly and helpful.
4
Vegetarian restaurant with nice tasty dishes.
We had the pooris and were satisfied with the quick service and tasty food.
Accommodating of guests using MasterCard too, which was good.
5
Excellent authentic sumptuous food. Have been going to the Bangalore main premises regularly over the last 40 years.The Singapore branch does not exactly provide the same 100% Bangalore taste but I would still give it 5 stars rating as it is really good food at a reasonable price in a very clean and hygienic environment.The Kharabhat was spectacular and the plain dosa was also very tasty. Tried the Badam Halwa, it was very good.We went there 2 times during this trip to Singapore as we found the taste so much to our liking.Please check their timings before you go as this place closes fairly early as compared to other nearby Indian restaurants
4
Clearly the best and the cleanest South Indian tiffin place in Singapore. Very friendly and decent manager/cashier, much cleaner than any othe the other messy Indian places in Little India, clean staff, very good quality food and service. Its a simple, clean air-conditioned place. Better than many similar places in India, by far
5
Traditional southern Indian food. Beautifully seasoned. This is not your typical European curry, so be warned. Mildly spiced, delicious food. Really clean, cool and tidy. Service was excellent.We had the masala dosa, veg Sosa, onion uptipam and they all disappeared very quickly.Shame there isn't this sort of Indian food where I live in Wales. For three of us including drinks and puddings only $54/Â£2
5
The problem with living in parts of Europe is that we simply do not get good south Indian breakfasts. While we do make up on every trip back home to India and also try our best at home in Switzerland, we do miss a good masala dosa or a well made bisi bele bath. So during our recent holiday to Singapore, my husband, daughter and I made it a point to visit MTR a couple of days for breakfasts. The place is easy to locate in Little India and very clean and has all the favourite dishes, most available right through the day.During our two breakfasts we tried the masala dosa, rice and rava idly, vada, chow-chow bath and bisi bele bath and they were all spot on. The service was prompt and very efficient and we felt very welcome. Reminded us of the great dishes we love so much and miss so much. Thanks MTR
5
The menu was an illustrated book (which for a non Indian is not a detail) and the food excellent.
I was surprised by the price which was incredibly cheap: I had two big dishes for 12 S$!
5
Great choice of Dosas and south indian specialties (Bangalore). Good friendly service - but the place is very popular and is always busy
5
Fantastic Food- had a great time with my family here for dinner the other night. Excellent Coffee and Dosa. Very nice and friendly service also!
4
Very good to know the Indian culture , despite being in Singapore.
Recommend! The rava idli is very good!!!
5
We visited MTR because we are always on the lookout for a great culinary experience and we were not disappointed! The service is attentive and efficient. Cleanliness is also highly visible. The tastes are to die for. I wish I lived near an MTR restaurant.
2
I went here for dinner one night. The restaurant is VERY clean. They pride themselves on that and I even poked in the kitchen to see. The place definitely upholds high standards. The waiter was very nice and helpful in suggesting what to order. Now, I have never had southern Indian food, so this may be my problem, but the entire menu is full of grainy heavy foods. We ordered the Rava Idli, Masala Dosa, and the Bonda Soup. We were told those were the most popular. Everything tasted the exact same... a ball of bread with no flavor. Maybe I have no tastebuds though. Apparently everyone else on here likes this place. Maybe check out the menu before you head down here. For a country that is known for having fantastic food, I wouldn't waste my time here
5
Very nice vegetarian Indian food. Basic settings but very nice staff. Unique and somehow unusual. I'm impressed by seeing the love for desi ghee in their food. The dishes are served very quickly so if there are no tables available I'll recommend you all waiting as it is worth waiting for and trust me it won't take long
5
Amazing meals .. We had been to New Zealand , where we couldn't find vegetarian food and finally wen we landed here in Singapore. We rushed to mtr and the food that we gulped had there for two had filled the gap of thirteen days of our starving. The taste was much much better than what we even have in bangalore. South Indian meals especially. The waiters were very good in terms to serving quick and we were more than happy cuz it was like home food away from home. Thank you so much for serving us there.
5
An excellent place to have breakfast, lunch or dinner. I have by now tasted a fair bit of the menu and find most items excellent. The Pongal is different from other restaurants but fairly nice. The neer dosa and Podi dosa are excellent and must taste. The rava idli is very good (served with potato curry and ghee ) ... I can go on but would let you figure some out for yourselves .. What I find excellent is that last 2 times I noticed that waiters after handling used plates are always either washing their hands or using a disinfectant . The cooks always have their heads covered. Gives you faith in level of cleanliness.
4
Menu was clear and had everyting in english which helped a lot to know what dishes include. Place was full and we had to wait for table for some time but we ordered foods while waiting and when we got table we almost instantly got food which was nice to
4
Simple and tasty breakfast with great filter coffee. The service is excellent, the areas are kept very clean and I will always go back for more!
4
Super food with consistent quality every time you visit, with efficient and considerate service. Cooked in desi ghee, the South Indian food is as good as you'd get anywhere! Don't miss.
5
You order and pay when you enter the restaurant. You may have to wait, but it's totally worth it.
Tasty food, friendly atmosphere and nice staff.
4
Had dinner on 24th night. Had to wait for quite some time but worth the wait. Food was served quite fast n it was tasty. But sambar was watery n not good. May be the karnataka recipe. Definitely worth visiting
4
The food is really good authentic south Indian taste, friendly staffs, although busy but very clean and good service ,keep up the good work!!!

Our favourite place to have south Indian food in Singapore. Very clean. food is very tasty and service excellent and instant. Very reasonable price. love the plain dosa and bisibele bhat here. would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for good south indian food in Singapore
4
Wow, MTR Restaurant does not only serve great tasting food, but the value is amazing. I have to say if we'd not used TripAdvisor rush to recommend and find it we may just have walked past and not noticed it. The place seems very popular with the locals residents which is always a good sign. We were very lucky to get a seat as quickly as we did as the place was full when we arrived. I'm not a vegetarian, in fact I normally try to avoid that sort of food but if they opened up one in the UK near me I could easily become one
5
Fantastic vegetarian Indian food. Basic settings but very nice staff. Unique and somehow unusual Indian specialties are included in the menu. You can have a mini menu which contains several different dishes. It looks quite small in the picture in the menu but in reality it is quite filling and the price is great. The flavours of the dishes are exquisite. We got there early but in was getting busy quickly as it seems to be very popular. The dishes are served very quickly so if there are no tables available I recommend waiting as it is well worth it and it won't take long
4
As is the case with many of these god places in litre india, the MTR is also a very nice joint. As one can expect, it was crowded on a Saturday evening , avoidable unless u don't have another leisurely day. The mini meals,coffee , khara bath are worth mentioning. I didn't give a 5 because the sitting area is really small and the coupon system is a bit irritating i.e u pay first and then allot a seat and u eat. .
5
I have been to Singapore quite a few times but this is the first time i had food at MTR in little india. Had meals for lunch.The food quality was excellent. quatintity was sumptuous too.good amibiance. clean utencils, hot and tasty food. if you are a south Indian pure veg type.... MTR is a must visit. they have other tiffin verities too for breakfast and evening snacks.... certainly one of the best places that i have had food in singapore
4
I visit this restaurant quite often. Very clean environment. Tasty food. Good ambience. Very friendly staff. Not to miss when in Singapore
5
Excellent service too. Just keep in mind that some of the staff don't speak English fluently, but despite this you will always feel well looked after.
5
The food is excellent. Very tasty & authentic South-Indian cuisine is served. The owner personally meets & greets all guests & is highly concerned about the satisfaction of his customers. There may be some waiting to get a table on weekends, but once seated, the food is quickly served. Must visit
5
I lived in bangalore for 8 years and didn't go to MTR even once. I moved to sing 4 years back and must have gone to the MTR here atleast fifty times. It has ended up becoming one of our stock places for a Saturday lunch or dinner. We normally reach around closing time and that helps us avoid the mad queues that have also become a norm here. The food is yum. Service is brisk. You pay when you order and then pay at the end for the additional stuff you order (believe me there will be lots). I particularly recommend the Mysore masala dosa and the bisi bele baath. Also the coffee at the end. Bliss.
4
This was my first visit to this restaurant and my first visit to a karnataka restaurant in 8 years.The restaurant is a little difficult to find because it is at the other end of Serangoon road. I started walking from Little India and wasn't aware that it is a very long walk. For those of you who haven't been here before, if you are walking from little india, it is after Mustafa's mall and next to the MRT station. Once inside the restaurant, we were greeted nicely by the manager. I told him that it is my first visit to mtr restaurant and he gave me the menu and asked me if I needed any help choosing the food. The food is absolutely fantastic and was worth the long walk to the restaurant. The taste is very authentic karnataka. The staff and the manager are very friendly and the prices are reasonable too. If you are in Singapore then you should definitely plan a visit to this place
5
Recently visited, its most authentic food i find in singapore. For vegetarian its a real paradise. MTR serves good south Indian food. Dosa ,bisbilee bhat , Rava IDLI are some of trademark of MTR. Overall good food experience.What I like about MTR is that the quality is consistent and the service is very friendly. We can even here kannada songs outside the country i.e., in MTR Singapor
4
I read reviews from other visitors and was very excited to have besilbele bhath. It was long time since i had one, to my surprise it was on the OK side. on the other side, we had ordered pudi dosa and onion rava dosa which was very good. Pongal was nice as well. almond milk is must try at this place. other thing to note is most items we tasted were cooked in ghee so had nice taste coz of it
5
The name is just enough for me to have visited this place. I was initially skeptical if the taste would match Bengaluru standards, but to my pleasant surprise it was better on some delicacies.You haven't had south india special if you haven't tried it here. Will come back soon..
5
We were recommended to try the vegetarian food at MTR by Indian expatriate friends living in Singapore. The place was packed (on a Saturday) even though it was rather late for lunch (2pm) The waiter was very helpful as we had no clue of what to order. We decided to try their set menu. The food was yummy and wholesome. The prices is very reasonable for the amount of food we got. A worthwhile detour. I am sure we will be back for more whenever we are in eh neighbourhood
5
First thing that attracts you to this place is the name itself .. MTR. People who have experienced the yummy food in the Bengaluru MTR will not find any difference in the taste and the aroma. The chutney and the Sambhar are as good as the original MTR taste at Bengaluru. The price looks little more but worth every dollar for a real taste of MTR. Just remember if you are a filter Coffee lover, ask them to make it Strong when you order the coffee
3
Good delicious Food but very expensive for Indian Foods and very less quantity. Getting tables on weekends is extremely long.
4
MTR serves good south Indian food. They have their special desserts also. Dosa ,bisbilee bhat , Rava IDLI are some of trademark of MTR. Overall good food experience
5
Outstanding South Indian food. Great value. Try the specials of the day for variety and something different. Recommend Podi dosa, Dangi vada and bad am milk.
5
Amazing masala dosa and rava idli (I seriously recommend the masala dosa, simply yummi...) Good price, the best indian vegetarian food I've tried as far.
5
Food was excellent as ever. Must try the millet dosa which has an unusual nutty flavour. The mini idli and dosa were also good. What I like about MTR is that the quality is consistent and the service is very friendly. Go there for great vegetarian South Indian food - not for the ambience.
5
Recently visited, its most authentic food i find in singapore. For vegetarian its a real paradise. Great value of my money. Its little expensive than other south indian vegetarian restaurant but its worth to visit again. 2person meal cost about S$30/- but still its worth to visit again. Service is quiet prompt
5
The taste is authentic. The prices are beyond reasonable (a filling meal for two, including beverages will cost around $20). And the service is prompt.After multiple visits, I've yet to order something that did not taste great. Must haves would be - Bisibelebath, pudi dose, set dose and badam milk.Slightly generous in the use of oil, but that's not much of a deal-breaker for me
5
This s really a great value for mo ey restaurant. For the price we pay we found it amazing. The staff is so so friendly and the food selection s huge we can t eat all it s just too much. We really like it and ll come back everytime we go back to this city
5
I had heard great things about this place. I was in Mustafa Center and decided to swing by for a quick bite. We ordered Masala Dosa and another item (which was basically two servings of fried bread of maida with very similar taste to samosa with sauces). Now this was my first experience of eating a dosa so i have a no reference point to compare it. But on its own, i loved the bread of masala dosa. The filling of spicy potato could use more "masala" to my pakistani taste but it was good. I specifically loved the bread as it was very soft from inside. I also tried the Masala Tea and i loved it. It was fantastic
3
I've been wanting to try MTR food for the longest time. I went on a weekday evening about 30mins before closing. The cashier did tell us what was available. I took masala dosa and my partner took the masala podi dosa. We tried the sambar vadai too. Drinks were badham milk & masala tea. All I can say is I've tasted better masala dosa & sambar vadai!It was quite average..nothing out of the ordinary. But the podi masala dosa was tasty. The waiter forgot about the drinks until reminded. Prices are steeper than other Indian vegetarian stores like Komalas or Anandha bhavan.Overall, I would rate it as average, but would try again on another day when it's not nearing closing
5
This place is one of the best south indian eating joints and serves authentic namma ooru cuisine. You will not be disappointed if you are nostalgic about the food from bangalore / mysuru. Go and give it a try……..
4
We have been wanting to have good South Indian food & so dropped by the simple but popular MYR. We Really good Dosas, Utthappam & Vadas. Simple, fresh and authentic flavours. Will come back for more
4
Finally i find a Good spot that serves great Indian and especially South Indian food. I missed the great dosa from chennai and the spices and tastes of South India! Happy to have found it! Will be coming back for sure!
5
Great food ..tasty ,hygienic at a very good price .This place offers the best South Indian food in Singapore.
4
Best vegetarian place in Singapore. Must try are all their signature dishes - dosa leading the pack of all. Don't forget to complete your meal with a fresh filter coffee - affordable prices and very clean makes it a pleasant dining experience.
4
I went to the restaurant for lunch . It was awesome to be there . It reminded me of a restaurant in chennai . In another words it made me feel as if I was not in Singapore but in Chennai . The dosa and idili and rasam are must haves surely over there . But the restaurant closes for lunch at 2: 45 pm and again reopens late . Be sure to be there on tim
5
Got a whiff about MTR pretty late even though I have been here for 15+ years but better late than never. Really traditional South Indian food and the best of the lot is their masala dosa which is cooked to perfection. It also has a great rava idli which also seems to be a healthy option for the conscious ones. The ambience reeks of a full fledged desi feeling and it definitely makes you feel like a home away from home. A definite breakfast repeat option for me and my spouse. Love it. Keep it up guy
4
As a bona fide meat lover, it is difficult to imagine how a vegetarian restaurant could have a such a powerful hold over my imagination and my appetite.The dosa served here may be simple dishes, but it is executed with full-on flavour and unreservedly satisfying. In the spirit of full disclosure, I am not a frequent consumer of the dish, preferring the local and humble versions of Prata but this has opened my mouth to a whole new world of tastiness. A bonus is that the owners seem to have a preoccupation with cleanliness and tables were fastidiously wiped.An experience for both locals and tourists
4
Given the expectations set by the price tag, MTR lived up to those related to the quality and taste. We had a Rava Dosa, a Rava Idli, a Set Meal, Buttermilk and a Badam Milk for my kid. The food was excellent. I was charged for a chilled Badam Milk because I hadn't clarified I wanted the Hot version, but the server thankfully clarified and redid my bill and returned back the difference. The staff were very patient as well given we took a while to finish our meal as my wife and myself took turns making sure my kid was also fed.The one downside was that I had to ask for rice to be served for my set meal after waiting a while where typically the servers notice you're ready to be served rice and prompt you. One star taken away for the cumbersome ordering process where you order ahead and then take your seats. We probably ordered too much because of that. Also found it odd that this process was waived for a few guests selectively

We hunted this place down on the strength of its reviews, and were not disappointed. Despite several negative comments we had seen about the service, we were invited to bypass the 'place your order at the till' process and given good advice on what to order... one lunch special (thali), one idli and a dosa massala.The food started being served very quickly, and nothing disappointed. There were lots of great flavours, and though we would probably give the fried breads a miss next time round, this was a great inexpensive way to find out a bit more about southern indian cuisine and have a good lunch too.Just one thing to note — no alcohol
4
We've never been to a vegetarian Indian restaurant before, but it was a nice experience. The food came along promptly. It was hot and very fresh and tasty. The only problem was the lack of alcoholic beverages.
5
We had the best ever south indian food in Singapore, delicious food and at fordable price. right in front of Sri Venkatenshwara temple.
5
The best South indian food you can eat in Singapore. Authentic taste and very customer friendly staff. Would recommend to all south indian food lovers. My favorite is rava masala dosa and filter coffee
4
My second visit, was just as good as the first. The wait wasn't too Long surprisingly and the location works very well for MRT Travellers. You're sure to love the food too :)
5
Awesome food ,excellent service and super polite staff. i loved that. Keep it up guys , see you soon

Whenever I go to an Indian restaurant ... I always look for an excellent service and quality food when I pay a high price. This place has quality and good vegetarian food but simply lacks a good customer service. The prices they quote on their menu is high so I would expect quality and good food.. but if the restaurant lacks customer service then it cannot compensate on the price you pay for food. You can always get good food anywhere.. what stays with you when u recommend someone is service. We had a bad experience recently when we had visited the restaurant. We were 5 of us and When in queue for ordering food, as soon as we saw empty seat.. 3 of my friends went to book the seat .. in the mean while we were ordering the food and asked for 3 bisibele bhaat. The person at the counter thought how can 2 people eat 3 bisibele bhaat? So he looked astonished and asked again.. as if he was checking on how 2 people can eat 3 bisibele bhaat. He dint need an explanation on why we want 3 because it's the customers choice on how much they want to eat. My friend informed that we have others sitting at the table and hence we ordered 3 .. we dint owe any explanation but had to.. anyways he then curtly asked why 3 bisibele bhaat and not try other bhaats like khara bhaat or curd rice etc.. it's none of his business on why we would want something 3 plates and not other options.. you can suggest nicely on other options u have but his Curt reply had an attitude which would put off any customer.. So while the food tastes good.. their customer service needs some real revamp because they forget that poor customer service can lead to a severe damage to their business... there are much better servicing and great Indian and south Indian food restaurants which are less pricey.. sad to experience an Indian food joint not managing customer service .. in Indian culture.. guest is treated like a 'God' hope the pull up their socks soon and act soo

I thought I could never find vegetarian food in Singapore as authentic as what we had in India. MTR brings back memories of the awesome vegetarian food found in middle tier and hole in the wall restaurants all over the country. The spices are so unique and deeply flavourful. We love every single dish and is now officially our favourite family restaurant.
4
I have been to their Bangalore outlet many items and hence was very excited when I heard the news of SIngapore branch. Food as usual is good. it's bit expensive. So if you only care about the quality and taste of the food, this is a must visit place for vegetarians.Try Khara bath, Bisbelle bath and other authentic karnataka food
3
I came in expecting amazing food and was underwhelmed. The food was a bit on the mild side and the entire process of getting food is a bit challenging as well.The good news is that it is very reasonable cost wise and the staff is delightful
5
They use better flour for their dosai. Crispy on the outside. I always go for masala dosai when i eat here. Must visit for authentic Indian vegetarian food. Gets crowded on weekends and evening times. best to go earlier about 5.30 to 6pm or 11.30 to noon
5
One of my favorite restaurants. Almost as good as the original MTR in my home town Bangalore.
Don't miss the Dosas...I prefer the plain dosa but all the variations are super. Probably the best filter coffee in Singapore. Great Vedas and Idlis.
Great service too...
5
MTR known for its authentic south indian dishes with a touch of Karnataka flavors is a delight for anyone who appreciates good indian food. Very authentic taste and great service. Simply love the food
4
Food was really very tasty, good quality ,i must say, Price was very norminal , restuarant looked like a fastfood shop, could make it more exclusive ,because the food is really. Good
5
I have visited MTR thrice last week and must say the quality is consistent and taste is finger licking good 😀 highly recommend for both locals and tourists. Don't forget to try pudi masala dosa and kesribath- they are simply outstanding
5
Perfect for Vegetarians... We went for a lunch time dosa and it was speedy service and tasted delicious! Nice little place in busy little India.
5
Authentic good south indian here. We tried several dishes and all were fresh and good. they take an order as soon as you enter, as no one takes an order on the table. they just serve on the table. for fresh orders as well one must go back and oder at the receptio
3
Have been there a few times on Sunday. Limited Menu. BisiBele Bhath is outstanding, but the other dishes are pedestrian. The fast food format of ordering/paying first and then look for table is not very attractive. Limited space. For a Sunday south Indian tiffin meal there are many other more attractive option
4
MTR has exceptionally high standards of quality and service and has become the GOTO place for a nice veg meal. The only drawback is that they often run out of the most popular dishes like puliogire or bisi bele bhat. Having said that it's a must try, dishes to go for are the bisi bele bhat, puliogire, bonda soup and the madur vada...do note not all of these are made everyday, but when available they are fresh and mouth watering
5
It was true to its expectation, delicious authentic south indian food. The restaurant in opposite the temple, in a not so crowded area of Little India, hence a good location too. Do not get intimidated by the waiting queue, their service and turn-around time is quite fast, and its worth the wait :
5
MTR Restaurant in Little India has been operating for over a year now in Singapore and it has already found a large fan following. MTR , Bangalore has been my favourite South Indian restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised to find the same delicious fare at their Singapore outlet. Rava Idli is my favourite. We had Ragi Dosa, Masala Dosa & Bisse Belle Bath and they were served with two types of chutneys & ghee. The filter coffee was awesome ! The service is efficient. On a weekend there could be a wait time of 30 to 45 mins.
4
Taste of Tradition, first time at this place, just loved the frames on the walls with all food information & also the taste was nice with all different flavours needed in an traditional South Indian Cuisine.
Will visit again to taste more dishes.
5
It was a pleasant experience dining at MTR. The food tasted divine. possibly one of the best vegetarian restaurant in this part. the ambiance was good and the price was quire reasonable. we had masala dosas the chutney and sambar were very good.
5
Nice Indian food with good and quick service makes this place really great. We had dosas which were good and tasty. Also had a mango lassi which was also really good.
5
I have dined at MTR multiple times and the taste and quality has always been great.
They serve a decent variety of dosas and rice dishes. Do try the neer dosa with coconut jaggery or the all time classic masala dosa.
4
We had our last breakfast in Singapore here. The service was great as well as the food. Give the things you don't know a try.
4
Close to Farrer Park MTR station, this Indian vegetarian restaurant is excellent value for money and serves amazing masala dosas. The service and cleanliness are excellent. While the menu is limited, there are daily offers on what is already very inexpensive food. Highly recommended.
5
I will rate the taste of the food excellent! fresh and delicious! the best pongal in singapore! the service is fast and i find the restaurant clean.
4
Visited last night with the intention of going somewhere else. Very pleased we did not. Starting with the lovely staff, from the manager down, who took trouble to go through the menu, explain what things are and make some recommendations to the zippy service and very clean environment it is a very welcoming experience. Food is southern Indian. Tiffin style dishes so lots of semolina based things. All come out in sensible portions, a bit staggered so as not to overwhelm. We probably had too much so did not get to dessert but that warrants a return trip. Also to try some of the daily dishes and other things we missed. Look forward to it.
3
An ardent lover of South Indian food, a Scottish friend of mine and I have scoured the little INDIA restaurants for the best idlis and dosas. Hailing from Chennaix a neighbour of Bangalore, from where MTR heralds, I was very excited to go and done at this place.So after our usual 12 kms walk, we went there to satiate our hungry souls. I was shocked to see the price of one piece idli was $3! And the price of a plate of pongal was $5. To top that, the taste was so average. The idlis were soft, but the chutneys and sambar were really so so. I will never go back!And Murugan idli or sarvanaas Bhavan , 3-4 mins away from this place still ranks at #1&#2 position
5
I've travelled quite a bit, including 6 weeks in India north and south, yet MTR blew me away. Incredible variety and an amazing introduction into the wonders of vegetarian Indian food, I cannot recommend this unbelievably cheap and fantastic restaurant enough. A must go for vegetarians and foodies with a taste for Indian.
4
Overall solid good South Indian food. However, not so impressed with the more typical dosa order - but on the other hand a lot of great South Indian dishes different from normal dosa-idli. Very good service also.
5
Food quality and taste was just amazing: a typical Bangalore style!
Ambience was good.
Felt like I was in classic "MTR Lalbagh road,Bangalore"!!!
5
MTR has a great reputation in India and itsbSingapore restaurant is fantastic too... clean & hygienic, air conditioned, with mouth watering food & efficent service at a reasonable price. Can't miss this!
5
The famous MTR of Bangalore keeps its high reputation intact in Singapore as well. Very good food, absolutely authentic South Indian - Kannadiga - and fresh. Quick service, the Set Thali was excellent, the Dosas and Vadas great. Happy to be there.
5
The service was great. It was first my colleagues and I went to the restaurant. It was also my first time to try authentic Indian cuisine. My colleague brought us there cuz decent Tripadvisor review. It turns out the review is quite true. Since we were seemed a bit lost while ordering, I believe the store owner found us lost and began introduce us the dishes there and helped us ordered. The food was delicious and more than I anticipated. I didn't expect I will like the food. The food is quite similar to Tex-Mexican food I had back in the states. Overall is great! 5 stars. Tk
5
For anyone craving South Indian in Singapore, MTR is the place! With its fabulous location and Super food it's a real steal considering the price for a meal for 2 being just about S$ 20 at the most. The Idlis were yum and the dosa was also great. It's busy at times, especially during the week-end so avoid the rush hours
5
While Little India @ Singapore provides a lot of choices for the south india vegetarian palate, MTR is the only choice for authentic south indian. For the Rava Idli served at MTR, we dont mind going in as many times! A little cramped for space at peak times, it definitely is a preferred joint
5
One of the oldest establishments of Indian restaurants, this place surely knows how to make fresh vegetarian Indian.Had their mini meal which is a combination of small dishes in a set platter. Great for one person wanting to try abit of everything. What's great was the food was flavourful but not too rich that it'll make you feel uncomfortable.All my Indian friends have always asked me to try this place and I finally understand why!14 per person, and this includes a mango lassi (yogurt drink) which was very tasty and thick!I'll definitely be back here again
5
If you ever had Indian Dosai - and you want to try a different yet authentic take on it - visit this place. Food is outstanding - and the consistency is amazing. I eat here every once in a while and the quality of ingredients (they use ghee) is pretty good. Highly recommended
5
This is a fantastic vegetarian eat out. The food is very tasty and they have very unique dishes that are not available in other vegetarian Indian restaurants. This is far by the best Indian vegetarian restaurant that I have eaten in Singapore. Value for money, though a little on the upside for a quick food setup. Crowded as always and the service can be improved. You have to pay before you eat! This is not a place for fine dining, but a good place for people who are starved for good South Indian stuff in Singapore
5
One of Our Fav. food joints in Singapore for South Indian Food.. The Idli with the Ghee and Sambar is one of the Tastiest one can have. the Dosa's are thick but Crisp.. Impeccable Taste and Good Value for Money!
5
Awesome south Indian restaurant in Singapore. Its really surprising to see such a homely restaurant. We enjoyed a lot...
5
Awesomely welcomed! Very good food, it was a new experience as it was a local restaurant in Little India. The waiter advised us what we should eat.
5
We went there during lunch time on working day and it was not that crowded. The food is excellent; authentic south Indian vegetarian treat!
5
I visited this restaurant with my wife for dinner on Friday evening. We really liked the food. Enjoyed a lot. The restaurant was over crowded. The staff was very nice and provided good service. The food was really awesome. We visit this restaurant frequently.
3
Had been to this renowned restaurant.food is good and the crowd is overwhelming.have enjoyed many a meal out here and the food is very tasty.quantity is fairly good.the set meals are very economical.the only thing i did NOT like is that one has to pay first before sitting downto eat.Now for a first timer or otherwise,how does one know how much he will consume.I beg to differ and not like this practice
5
Be sure to reach early to avoid rush. One must taste bisibelle bath and filter coffee. Bisibelle bath is slightly spicy but not too hot. Their sambhar is very good as well. Don't hesitate to experiment as preparations are authentic and not too spicy, so definitely whatever you order it will be tasteful. Ingredients are authentic and fresh. Staff is friendly helpful and clean.. Have fu
5
We've been eating here about once a week since discovering this restaurant at the eastern end of Little India - the daily specials mean lots of variety at both lunch and dinner. The Rava Idly are stuffed with fresh herbs and nuts, great variety of dosas and just yummy Bisibele Bhath - Thali available at lunchtimes. Efficient service although it can get busy which means queuing up to order, but well worth the wait
4
This unassuming, simple Indian vegetarian restaurant is located at the northern end of Little India and is mostly full (with Indians). It is, though, worth the wait and extremely good value. The lunch menu is more extensive than the dinner menu and, despite the crowd, all the dishes are freshly prepared and quickly served (you can reckon to be in and out in half an hour). The waiters will help with explanations and presentation of the 'signature' dishes and are uniformly courteous. Viator Colonia
4
We have been to MTR several times, and most recently a few days ago. Although the restaurant had some initial teething problems when it first opened, the management seems to have sorted them out. Food was delicious, service was pretty quick and the queue was not too long, despite being a Saturday evening. Note that this is not a fancy restaurant - one comes here for the food and not the ambience (rava idlis, bisibele etc)
3
Visited this place for dinner on Friday evening, and it was over crowded, restaurant staff were not able to manage this.
To me food was average, I did not find anything special
5
Food served is very excellent we get ver good hospitality. We feel that
We are in India every one visiting singapore must taste the food so that we can rber singapore for ever
5
Clean & simple, friendly service. Best South Indian vegetarian option available in Singapore. We love it for breakfast, lunch and dinner!
2
This vegetarian restaurant close to Little India is too crowded and too small. Food is nothing special and all the options in the set menu are quite the same taste. The semolina cake is useless, mango lassy is good but extremly overpriced, the menu with the pictures doesn't show the prices (very unfair)
5
We were looking for an atm when we came past this restaurant and saw a big que outside so we thought it must be nice food and we were definitely not disappointed! We asked them to recommend us what's nice so we got a nice range of very tasty food. I still don't really know what it was but it was superb. They were super quick with serving the food and everyone was very friendly, especially the other guests on our table. We wanted to come back the next day but they are closed on Monday. So we went back again on Tuesday but had not checked the opening times that closely before and came just after three when they did their two hour lunch break. But I will go there again whenever I will have a day or two in Singapore! :
4
Finally made it to this much ballyhooed highly-rated south Indian restaurants in the Little India district. Slightly further down Serangoon Road, almost where Little India quarter ends - so easy to miss this one. However, the restaurant serves up very decent south Indian cuisine, with good service. The decor is better than most restaurants of its ilk and it certainly appears brighter and cleaner than similar restaurants. Tried both the masala dosa as well as the rava masala dosa. Both were good, and the crepe was thicker in true authentic south Indian style. Having said that, I kind of prefer the less-authentic thinner, crispier north Indian version of the dosa - and for my money, the Raj restaurant does a better job of it (it also has a more varied menu with several more choices). Still worth trying this place at least once
5
Typical South Indian Rava Dosa, unaltered for South East Asian tongues. The variety of spices used, tickled each and every single taste buds of mine. The real taste of Tamil Nadu. You can experience it yourself at MTR 1924 which is located along Serangoon road infront of Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple
5
MTR is a no-frills restaurant that concentrates on providing homely South-Indian food with fresh and quality ingredients. I am a great fan of most of their menu, so I have a tough time choosing what to eat everytime I visit. This is a must-visit for all fans of South-Indian vegetarian food. You'll have to return multiple times to try out all that you'd want to try
5
Just loved the food! Definitely a recommended place to hv your south indian meal.The ambience was good, staff well organised, service efficient and food great.Initially when I read reviews stating - 'this place has better dosas than india' I thought people might just be exaggerating - but after my visit share the same view
5
This restaurant is right by the Fahrer Park MRT station (Mustafa's exit) and well worth a visit. It is mostly filled with locals and can get rather filled at busy times, but the quality of the food is such that I would brave any line or crowded condition
5
Great Indian vegetarian food with plenty of choices and at a good price.
We liked the food so much we came here twice on our 4 day holiday.
Must try the masala dosa and the deserts are small but yummy
4
great taste but overpriced. loved the bisibela bath and podi dosai. delicious food, will go again for sure.
5
Visited numerous times during our two week stay in Singapore
Had lunch, breakfast, dinner.
Tried various dishes and the best of them was Neer Dosa
A must visit for Indian food
5
I really loved the food here. The food here is definitely worth a visit and the mango lassi here is amazing!
4
Good restaurant to have the south Indian food. Neat, clean, hygienic. The food is very tasty. Good value for the money. A standard hotel.
5
The amazing flavors, high quality and consistency of the food served at this casual, well-priced and no-frills restaurant makes it for me, easily, the best South Indian restaurant in Singapore (and better than any south Indian restaurant in the north or west of India)!
4
Good judge of a place is when there are lots of locals around. This place is right across from the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple and there seemed to be steady stream of people coming through. I went on a Sunday and ordered the Set Dosa. It was very good value for money at $5 and filled me up, but wasn't an incredible taste or anything. I think it might have been better to order what others have recommended in future. I'm afraid I can't comment on the authenticity but many other people here have, so I assume it tastes true to form
5
We ate lunch at MTR and loved every bite. All the Dishes we ate especially the Dosas were delicious. Better Dosas than what the have eaten in India. The place is very value for money. We had lunch for 2 in 20 Singapore dollars. The service is friendly quick and efficient. The place is quite popular so you might need to wait for a bit but their churn rate is very quick. A definite must do if in the mood for South Indian food.
5
It was a happy take off to start, as the food was one of the factor which enlighten my every day work . I was there with my friends for breakfast where in we had masala dosa & poori. This food refreshed our memory & bought us back the perfect southindian taste which u never get in singapore. Hardly i have seen chefs with masks covering their mouth during food preparation which i happened to see here & this adds up value to the food. Great food , value for money. Will drop by again for a vegetarian meal.
5
This stuff is addictive! I end up visiting at least once a week to enjoy rava idli, medu vada and filter coffee. Sort of reminds one of Vaishali restaurant back in Pune. Highly recommended for bisibeli bath!!! Note that it's closed in the early evening from 3-5
5
Bets vegetarian food in a very clean restaurant. Everything is freshly prepared in pure ghee/ butter and they have a good variety of dishes.Good service
5
Great taste. Friendly service, mini meals a must try. Located in the central area of little india belt. For south indian mouth watery dishes a must visit place.
4
We tried the Dosas and Vadas at this place and the taste was good.It is near the city square mall and right opposite the Temple on Serangoon Road.
5
This is the place to go if you love South-Indian meals. If you do not know the, go here to get to know them. Broad palette of dishes, all excellent. Our favorite Indian restaurant in S'pore. Plave may be quite busy with many locals......
5
My father in law and I visited this restaurant and the biggest compliment I can pay is we are both meat eaters and would turn vegetarian tomorrow if we ate here all the time. The restaurant is easy to find once you get off at the Circle Line Farrer road mrt station.One of the meals we enjoyed was the Masala Dosa. It was splendid and if time permits we will visit again before the end of the trip
5
Haha..The title sounds like a super hungry types..but yess I have never regret going MTR. .whatever I have ordered comes with a new taste and yess they serve super hot and super fresh food..to name a few..I always take there rice idli plain dosa curd rice and the 12$ thai is just amazing. .and ya..not to ever miss there $4 badam halwa. .It comes in a very small cup. .but trust me that is enuf to go gaga on that yummy ghee loaded halwa. 
3
Dropped in on the basis of the reviews but cannot understand what the fuss is all about. As we visited during lunch hour, there was a queue out of the door. Finally got seated after 10 minutes. The ordering must be done at the counter prior to being allocated a seat. We ordered masala dosai, idli and masala tea. The masala dosai was good, but a bit too oily, probably due to a lavish spread of ghee, which no doubt enhanced the taste. The idli was good, nothing to complain about. The masala tea was a poor imitation, not enough masala. The prices are on the high side. There are any number of vegetarian restaurants in the neighbourhood that will will be comparable if not better and at a lower price. Looking around the restaurant noted that there were a good number of Caucasians, obviously drawn, like me, by the upbeat reviews.
4
MTR was one of our favorite joints in Bengaluru and when it opend up in Singapore we were really thrilled. It is one of our favorite places to have good south indian food in Singapore now. Specially breakfast. the quality is maintained well.. it tastes exactly same as we had in MTR Bengaluru. Service is good. Some times waiting time is long. One must try sambhar wadai, rava idli and khara bhat there
5
For vegetarians ,like us,this hotel,is dream come true in place other than home to crave for!in particular we, Bangaloreans ,love have very heavy lunch @ MTR ,even skiping breakfast or having light munch to do full justice to delicious food served here.we went two times in our short visit of 10 days. All those who visit Venkateswara temple ,just opposite this hotel move straight to this place and then head towards Mustafa for shopping ,what a fun
4
We decided to visit for breakfast based on TA reviews.15 min walk in the heat was a beast but we were rewarded with a clean and AC restaurant, no queue and a cold divine drink!We had masala dosa and rava idly. Both were amazing.Full of flavour and not too heavy to start the day.We will definitely return
4
One of the best vegetarian food you can get in Singapore. The restaurant is very clean, in fact I can't remember a cleaner kitchen (yes, you can see the kitchen). Very nice and helpful waiters. Overall a very nice experience..
5
Absolutely my favorite place for dosas! Their dosas melt in the mouth thanks to the use of a nice quantity of ghee:) The service is excellent too. They are able to manage crowds well due to quick service. Love this place!
5
Best Karnataka Authentic Restaurent. Bisibillai bath, Set dosa at their best. In FARRER park, once u done with your shopping try here. Dont miss Ravva Idly here.
5
Well the taste is great so u wouldn't mind spending extra bucks. ..The location is pretty close to City Square which makes it convenient for travellers like us..
3
authentic south indian food.. it has avg ambience and decent food.. Nothing very great about it..can be tried once..but not to be repeated for me
5
Authentic tastes in all the food we ordered. Quick service and the meals were fresh, warm and tasty. Excellent service by wait staff. Food matches what the menu describes which is a huge bonus for first time South Indian food tasters who may not always know what to expect. A huge relief to find the masala doses prepared well and not too crispy or thin. Definitely returning to try more off the menu!
4
If you are looking for a good South Indian restaurant in Singapore this is the place to go. It doesn't hurt your pocket and the food is very good. The restaurant is very well maintained and service is equally good. I have been there twice already in my two visits to Singapore! Won't mind going there again
3
If you're looking to have true South Indian dish with great service, then this is the place to be.The food was averaged pricing , and delicious as well.Staff were prompt, but expected to be called if u want anything! When asked for extra serving, a little hesitant!Overall it's an okay place to have good vegetarian food
4
MTR is very popular in Bangalore, which is the capital city of the South Indian state of Karnataka. Their branch in Singapore is very close to the original taste. The dosas are melt-in-your-mouth yummy. You can also opt for a lot of other authentic Karnataka fare from the menu - bisi bele bhat, khara bhat, rava idli, rava dosa to name a few, and you will not be disappointed. Don't forget to taste the filter coffee
5
I have been a fan of MTR Bangalore since childhood. Was skeptical if the singapore branch can live up to the original quality and taste. They do actually !All the chefs are trained in Bangalore and every item on the menu is a masterpiece. I was in Singapore for a 2 week Business visit and I had most of my meals here in MTR making me feel at home. Masala Dosa her is the best offered in South India - unlike the saravana bhavan which expanded worldwide earlier, but MTR's dosa craftsmanship is at a different level and nobody can match it. Also, bisibelebath here is the most authentic and closest to my mom's bisibelebath. Everywhere else I've had it in the world is just sambar rice.Although I'd like them to sort out the queue management and strange token system. I remember coming here in Feb '15 and now in June '15 the crowds are larger and the queues longer. They will soon run out of space here with the growing popularity
5
Food quality is very good and more importantly consistent at all times. Despite restaurant being crowded almost all times service quality doesn't drop and cheerful staff is always there to help. Must visit place for South Indian veg food.
4
As someone who has moved to Singapore from Bangalore, i can vouch that they manage to (almost) recreate the taste of original MTR. They offer the popular choices in a neat environment and service of the friendly staff is always brisk
4
Perfect in food and service !
Breakfast which became brunch and then extended lunch . Authentic South Indian food in singapore
4
Visited this restaurant couple of times.. they only serve Indian vegetarian food.. It's really authentic and value for money.. The Price is very reasonable and taste of the food is too good..
4
Great place - a bit crowded but not too much of waiting time.
A bit more expensive compared to its other Little India counterparts - but you don't get this kind of Rava Idly,
4
I enjoy South Indian food and wanted to make the most of being in Singapore. Finding MTR was a lucky choice. Easy to find opposite Srinivasan Perumal Temple on Serangoon Road ( take 65 bus from Orchard Road). The staff were very helpful at suggesting some of the food we didn't recognise. The place was busy but they found us seats, and the service was fast and efficient even though all the food was all freshly prepared to order.I can recommend the Butter Milk (spiced), the masala dose and especially the onion utappam, which was delicious. The total bill was less than S$35 for more food than we could finish. Give it a try - you won't be disappointed
5
MTR - the name itself evokes nostalgia of the main establishment in Bangalore. The Singapore establishment is perhaps the best Pure Vegetarian South Indian restaurant in all of Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand put together. I visited them on a Sunday morning for breakfast and was not disappointed. The trademark Rava Idli served with Potato Sagu and Chutney was delicious. I have a liking for the Karnataka style sambar and had to ask for it as it is not served by default with the Rava Idly. The Uddina Vada (Urad dal vada) was hot, crisp and finger-licking delicious so were the ragi dosas. The filter coffee was hot and a [perfect way to wash down the delicious meal. Next time will try the Bisi Bele Bath and the Avalakki Bath, they looked tempting. P.S. your rava idly will come with a tiny serving of clarified butter (ghee). I recommend you pour it on your rava idli and make the best of your visit. The dieting can begin tomorrow. The biggest plus point of MTR is the service - everything is served hot. Nothing prepared and stored, every dish is freshly made
5
MTR Forever! Best food in Singapore so far! We really discovered MTR by God’s will and wish. When we moved to Singapore, little did we know that we are going to be put to a survival test and made to realise how much food, the basic need, matters! Singapore is a very fast place and has various multi cuisine destinations, but when it comes to eating every single meal out with the family for 45 days, it proved to be an ordeal! Luckily one day when we visited Lord Srinivasa Perumal’s temple on Serangoon Road, we happened to notice a restaurant while crossing the road. The letters MTR captured my attention and immediately the trip advisor page flashed the photograph in my mind. I crossed the road with enthusiasm and eagerness and my husband led us to the glass doors with the sign Open! Thank God it was not a Monday!The picture on the trip advisor made it look bigger but I was a bit disappointed to note that the shop was smaller and crowded and din’t like the idea of standing in queue with the children and to order our food, pay and then find a table. But it was anyway a new experience. The kids were quite boisterous and attracted the attention of the proprietor who immediately showed us a table while my husband stood in queue to place the order. We ordered Dosas and Chappathi and coffee and it was there within minutes. It was pretty noisy and the background music was hardly audible above the decibel levels so we really were not willing to come again. Felt like we were being rushed by our conscience since there was a bustling queue and the tables aren't many! Little did I realise then, that it is the food that is attracting the crowd here and it doesn't matter if you don’t get to hang over the food for an hour!It went to prove that it is not the ambience alone that matters and pulls people to eateries but the food! This lesson, we learnt here. The food quality was more than good. It was authentic. It had the right ingredients and mostly cooked in ghee and was priced in a moderate way (value for money) and above all it didn’t harm our system. Different from the routine, Kara bath, Avalakki bath, Bisebela bath and many more dishes await, to stimulate your taste buds.Next day I left the boys in the room and explored the MRT from Somerset to Farrer park and bought both lunch and dinner and with the fragrant aroma, wafting from the sealed microwave friendly packs, made my way to the hotel room and we ate the food until Breakfast time the next day!It has become a ritual from then on and my elder son still insists on only eating there and no where else. We are glad to have tried and tested every dish on their menu and the staff make us feel welcome with their warm smiles. They even remember to give my son, a cup of potato curry which he is fond of even if he orders a dish that is usually not accompanied by this. And when once he lost a toy which rolled under someone else’s table they retrieved it and gave it to him when we visited them again nearly three weeks later!We love MTR and always recommend to our friends who visit Singapore on a vacation. Don’t go without tasting their food! This is not a promo for them, coz I hardly know them beyond their warm smiles and understanding glances. We owe a heart felt thanks now that we are settled and for taking care of all of us during the hard times when we were on the look out for a house. Thanks to the management and their friendly staff and the wonderful cooks whom we can hardly see in all the steam and under the masks! Our best wishes for your steady progress and further forays in the hospitality world

An MTR joint without a beeline queue to get a seat is unimaginable. Be it Singapore or Bangalore...The Exec Meal was quite refreshing with an amazing mini masala dosai to start with along with a 0.10 ml of ghee in an unique tiny cup with an amazing chutney..and then follows the main course meal. The main meal was average but the starter was out of the world. Good place for veggie especially in that stretch of Serangoon road where there is none for a good few hundred metres...I thought MTR brand was sold off few years ago. More than the taste, its the hurry burry ambience that is the highlight. in my view its expensive
4
Servers are patient and helpful (can recommend dishes if you have no idea what to order). Food is well-spiced but not blindly so. Very carb-heavy. The lazy (but delicious) way out would be to go with friends who know what they're doing, so they can just order a bunch of dishes. I really liked this spiced yoghurt drink which I never got the name of. The restaurant is really brightly lit. A lot of foot traffic so you can't spend hours there, though the staff never rushed us
5
I never expected that I will get such a real taste of India in Singapore. I was really overwhelmed by the quality and taste I got. I literally forgot for a few moments that I am out of India.
3
Disliked
Food had a strong and overbearing taste of MTR masala mix
Sambar and Rasam disappointing
Waiter goofed up order and kept us waiting for long
Liked
Dosai - was crisp and tasty
Reasonably priced
4
MTR totally lived up to its reputation! Everything was great and fresh tasting. The Neer Dosa was clearly the hit of the day for us. Also, don't forget to order the Rava Idly - another fav of our group and repeatedly ordered through our meal.
3
Most of the food here is good, but on the expensive side. I did not like their veg pulav. Stick with some of the south indian dishes. Raita stinks with too much onion in it.
4
I wanna try the Indian food and looking at so many reviews before coming here. The food is good and not so expensive if compare with others around.
The staff were so nice and friendly. Recommended.
5
Mouth watering South Indian dishes were served. Service was also good. Location of the restuarant is good and easily accessible.
4
Overall many items that we have tried over the past few months have been tasty, so you should have a decent tasting experience most times. Their Rava Idli, Puli Ogre and Khara bhat are good when served fresh and hot. Their billing method (pay before you sit) was annoying at first, but once we visited again and again they allow us to sit and keep ordering and pay at the end, so that's ok. Prices are a bit steep considering so many other options near Little India. And yes, the queue is too long during peak hours, so you need to plan and go earlier
4
Great place to eat South Indian Vegeterian food in Singapore. Located in Serangoon Road.Place is always busy as the number of seating is less. I had to wail for more than 15 minutes to be seated but the wait was worth as the food was delicious
5
MTR is a huge institution in Bangalore, and it's great to have a clone here in Singapore. You can eat for less, but I usually end up spending about S$10-12 a head when I go. So be aware that you can get "South Indian" food for less--for example at Komala's, a few hundred metres away. For those who don't know, MTR's origins are in Karnataka state while many other South Indian outlets are from Tamil Nadu state. Of course Little India also has good Andhra and Kerala joints--Spice Junction on Racecourse Road and Prema's near Little India Arcade are good for Kerala food.What sets MTR apart is some specialties. You won't get some things like Ragi Dosa anywhere else in Singapore, and I'm not sure Rava Idly is easy to get either. They use different ingredients compared to most other eating places. Staff are friendly and the family who run the place seem to be on quite hands-on. My son usually asks for an extra chutney or two, and they don't have a problem with adding those, with a smile.The place is clean and neat. It does get a bit crowded--nice problem for them to have.In terms of negatives, I would say that the food seems a bit different from the "original" MTR where I went twice when I worked in Bangalore, many years ago. But I might be imagining it:) In any case, even back in 2002, it was hard to get to the original restaurant and even harder to get place, for those who lived in Bangalore. So I'm okay with a small difference. I have been there quite often since I heard about it, and I plan to stay a regular
4
There just can't be a better vegetarian place for food clean and hygienic in Singapore. Got to know of MTR Singapore through the ad on the itinerary of my tickets booked to Singapore, decided that it was a must visit place for sure while being there, and MTR, not only lived upto the expectations but just superseded with its cute looks and cleanliness, just can't think of any other vegetarian place to eat now in Singapore, after tasting it here. The set meal, the bisebelebath, and dosas yummy as usual, but getting the same taste overseas just revitalized my taste buds. Go ahead and enjoy the food out there all you foodies in SG is my biggest shout to all of you
5
Very good food. We had buttermilk, Upma, dosa and chapatti set and all of them were delectable. And the service is also quite fast and courteous
4
Nice authentic food.have lots of different specials and other items not usually found in other south indian restaurants in Singapore..good service..
5
This Bangalore based restaurant recreates the same authentic south Indian food experience in Singapore.
Good south Indian filter coffee!
Extremely courteous staff.
5
Another good addition of South Indian restaurants in Singapore. This one 90 years old chain from Bangalore. Amazing food, good quality, excellent service. MUST TRY..
5
Best place to eat authentic South Indian food in Singapore. Service is fantastic and the daily specials definitely have to be tried.
5
Me and my wife visited twice in two days , loved everything about the place . Taste, ambiance,quality,quantity and the hygiene all were up to the mark . Seemed like we are back in India thank you for a wonderful meal .
3
We visited the place last year after hearing lots of reviews from our friends. We found the place quite expensive. The experience of having the food served and then bill arriving was taken away as we stood in a queue to pay the money first. The food was average as compared to many other authentic south Indian restaurants in the area
5
Want to have the south indian food that we crave to eat in singapore, with taste and quality from back home (bangalore), MTR Singapore is my answer. Please eat here to experience the excellent taste, quality, cleanliness and service at a price which is beyond reasonable. I loved eating at MTR
5
Several times experienced MTR tasteful food and hospitality in Bangalore. Last week I had been to MTR Singapore in Little India. Standardising food taste isn't that difficult like McDonald but Hospitality is something unique. It is not just words like enjoy your food with mechanical smile makes you happy by serving affection out of heart that only be experienced
4
Have always wanted to take my wife to a tiffin South Indian meal experience as I have had in Bangalore. So when I heard about MTR, I said to her that we must try that. I have never had the meL at MTR restaurants in Bangalore, but judging from the taste, flavour and service; I am convinced that this is as authentic as the South Indian cuisine as could be. Our favourite is Neer Dosa, kind of pan cake with coconut chutney available only on Sundays. We also love their Bisibele Bhath, a rice dish made with lentils, vegetables, curry leaves and tamarind pulp. Both are delicious. You should also try their set meal menu served only after 11.30 AM. Delicious
5
We were looking for a south Indian breakfast in Singapore, and MTR was the best decision we took. Ended up going twice. The Honeylemon drink is very very good. Every item on the breakfast menu is very very good!
4
Swift service, once you pass the long queue. Very good good at competitive prices. Only South Indian food but that is more authentic than most in SGP. Recommended.
5
It's a small tiffin room which serves authentic South Indian food.
Best part is it is super hygienic and right in the center of city.
4
very neat and clean ambience.... good quality food.. little pricey but worth it... will go again on a weekday
5
The food was outrageously delicious. The restaurant staff was very helpful, and frankly, the customers were all Indians, which is a testament of how authentic and delicious the food is!
5
Excellent veg food in Singapore. We had a lunch and food taste same as in Bangalore MTR. Located in little India. Easily accessible. Value for money
5
Visited a few Indian Restaurants in Singapore and nothing comes close to this. It was authentic Karnataka food and in all fairness with lot of care. I took a special meal and it had a Masala Dosa with bisibele bath followed by a proper meal. Taste was good and fast and nice service Will definitely recommend this on your visit to Singapore
4
My Indian friends wanted to give me a taste of Indian fast traditional food in Singapore. They took me to MTR opposite an Indian temple in littleIndia .it has tables for about 50 people and is a clean efficient eatery . I could try several hot items traditional but served so quickly. Loved the variety of dosas and the sweet rice pudding
5
Best thing about this place is the attitude of the staff. They are most humble and family like I have ever found in any restaurant in India or Singapore. Food quality is good, ambiance is very nice and price is ok for everything else you get with good food :
5
Visited MTR after many years away from south India. The meal took me back to my childhood. But forget all that. Coming straight to facts, MTR is a genuine south Indian restaurant, that is usually packed with the local Indian crowd, families, children, couples etc... Tasty food in clean but simple premises, at reasonable prices
5
Great food great price, best South Indian food I've tasted, the place was pleasingly busy but got served really quick. Food tasted great - I recommend the masala Dosa, nicest I've had
5
Very good please keep up and serve ghee with all Dhosas as at Lalbaug and knead to make thick chatni please very delicious food and almost same aroma loved to dine there visited 4 times just to dine all the way from So Sofitel
5
Good tasty food, can enjoy with family. Good ambience and value for money. Neat n clean good n fast service as well.........
5
Only surviving thing was MTR as we were veg, so all the food service was through MTR, a good south Indian Veg hotel. Awesome taste they retain same taste as in Bangalore, good service, feels home food. Must visit if you are veg.
4
Great South Indian food, good service, great experience. Good choice of different dishes. And good healthy options.
5
Delicious food and very good service. Highly recommended restaurant from Karnataka. I and my friends are big fan of MTR.
4
After a nice movie in city square mall we landed up in MTR for our Dinner...Such a yummy mouth watering food it was..I can still taste the badam halwa in my mouth.. Akki roti,Podi Dosa,Masala Upma,yummmmmmy..Food Excellent quality,Service is Very Good,Ambience is Average,Friendly for Kids..We just checked whether they provide catering for Parties,they said they have not started yet,but is in their next to do list...So soon we can have MTR catered food in parties as well
5
I have been to MTR in Bangalore many times and have been amazed by the consistant good quality of snacks and other items. When MTR opened up here I was very excited and I am thrilled to say that they have maintained equally good standards of quality and hygiene.Best food. Great quality and consistency . good hygiene and hospitable staffWHAT MORE CAN ONE WAN
5
@TheKuoKnowsAway from the hustle and bustle of Little Indian's main shopping area is a haven for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food lovers, alike.Mavalli Tiffin Room - better known as MTR - has such a vast selection of tasty dishes that is probably exciting enough to turn hard-core carnivours into lifelong fans of vegetarian food.The Masala Dosa is paradise on a plate. Crispy and brown on the outside, with just enough filling to sate and appetising enough to ask to look at the dessert menu when you finish.This is where MTR's semolina pudding comes into its own. Aromatic and buttery, sweet and full of flavour, it is the perfect way to end a delightful meal that is neither a burden on the wallet nor heavy on the stomach.If you at a loss as to what to order, then just ask. The waiting staff are both knowledgeable and helpful. The manager is always on hand to offer his advice too. Yes, I have been more than once. And I will be going again.
5
...I asked our waiter if I could speak to the manager. Immediately, he was at our table. "Is everything alright?" the manager said worriedly. "Amazing," I replied, "but you must taste this..." I offered him a piece of puri which had a dab of badam halwa on it."The combination of textures and flavors is fantastic."With that a new dessert was born, but one that is not yet on the menu. The dish is named "sayuri" after its beautiful and charming inventor. To enjoy a 'sayuri', order puri and badam halwa. Dip a piece of puri into the badam halwa or, with a spoon, put a bit of badam halwa on the puri. The taste? Indescribably good.The puri is like a warm croissant and the badam halwa is somewhat like kaya, but not as sweet and with a more complex combination of flavors, including almond and saffron.A sayuri and a coffee are a perfect way to end your meal. (Small matter: in the menu, the badam halwa has been beautifully photographed in a glass bowl. But it arrived at our table in a plastic "take-away" container...not a great presentation and the planet has way too much plastic already. I strongly suggest MTR thinks of a way to present the bafam halwa in a manner which is more pleasing to the eye and gives the dish the presentation it deserves.
5
Authentic south Karnataka cuisine, the best masala dose in city, the other items on menu are incredibly tasty too. They'd pudi masala during Ugadi which was quite exceptional.
5
This is the best place for Authentic South Indian Vegetarian Food in Singapore. The food is fresh, restaurant is clean and service is very good.
4
Fantastic South Indian delicacies, served with affection and with the highest hygienic Standards. A MUST TRY.
4
The food is pretty amazing. It's a must go restaurant but the problem is very less space and too much crowd during weekends
5
Dont miss this restaurant if you pass by perumal temple, little India or Farrer park. Delicious food served with care. I just loved eating all the items in the menu. Never miss anything as everything is just super awesome !!
5
Most clean and hygienic Indian food, tastea yummy, a must go in singapore. I have been eating here for almost 2 years, absolutely consistent in quality.
5
A great fan of the original MTR in Bangalorewas super exicited when it opened it opened in SingaporeLovely food as good as the original But the exceptional part is the restaurant manager who puts his heart and soul into this restaurant and you can see it in the food and service.He is like a superman running from the kitchen to the counter to the tables .He is truly the one who makes this restaurant what it isThe rava idli,set dosai are too die for the Vadai excellent.A small tip for the vadai go in the morning at about 845 ,you will get them straight of the fryer ,Yummmmmmyyyy.Now to the disappointing part ,I went to Dubai recently and was pleasantly surprised to Find MTR opened there too,Tried it .Probably the worst food I have ever eaten.Square flat hard cold Idlis ???????In MTR? I was shocked .the chutney was sour as if stalethe Vadai my favourite was reheated on a pan.making it oily and hard on one side and spongy on the other ,YUckI think MTR looses all the goodwill it had after i visited the Dubai outletThe Dubai outlet is a Shame to thier good nameI think they need to hire someone like the Singapore manager over there or just shut it as sure I am never visiting thier Dubai outle
4
MTR restaurant provides excellent array of cuisine for lunch, tiffin and dinner. Seats are limited so long queues form up. The customer service is very good. The food is excellent taste. Prices are a little pricey but affordable for the occasional visitor. Thee is no savouries counter. There is only one branch in the Little India sector which is located in the south of Singapore
1
Seeing all the glowing reviews and craving for indian food decided to give it a try! The restaurant was easy to find. It is a small & charming place. Staff were friendly. We ordered rava idli, masala dosa, curd rice and couple more dishes to share. Service was quick & dishes arrived quick. The food is like many other restaurants in little India and they are way more cheaper! Don't understand the over hype of this place! Just walk down little India and you can find much more affordable choices!
4
Having done takeaways from MTR a week or so ago, we finally decided to pay the place a visit. Food quality was exceptional, the variety on the menu is lacking compared to other places that they will be compared to in the area - that said, what was available was exceptionally good. The ambience is rustic for lack of a better word - it has retained an old city/time feel to the place which may/may not appeal to people depending on their taste. The one other thing I liked about the place is the ease of parking with the temple car park bang opposite the restaurant making it very convenient - something that is difficult to say about a lot of other similar places in the area
5
Kannadigas will never miss Bisibelebath, rava dosa, masala dosa and maddur vada when they are in Singapore.
MTR offers great tasting food at reasonable prices.
4
Food is superbly delicious. The place and kitchen is very clean. Thought the menu selections looked great - I personally love restaurants and cafes that have a few items that are all excellent, rather than pages and pages of jumbled cuisines and dishes.
5
All my trips at MTR , have been really great !! the food is made with love and utmost care and is really very good to taste !! At Singapore , having such great taste food is a bliss !!! must visit ... great staff & great food !!! awesome place ,... thumbs u
5
Staying in a hotel 10 mins from Singapore's Little India and we had a VERY tasty lunch at this place today with masala dhosa and uttapham to eat, both very good and a mango lassi drink that hit the spot on a hot steamy day. Very highly recommended
5
This is indeed great Indian vegetarian food.Even my wife and children who normally don't fancy Indian food relish the food at MTR. The crispy vadai and the tasty bisibele bath are a must try. As for their coffee, nothing beats it - I've nearly stopped drinking at Starbucks and Coffee Bean after being addicted to the MTR coffee.In terms of cleanliness, I think they beat other similar restaurants hands down. Their waiters are courteous and always wear a warm smile - something very rare in most restaurants. Serving time is just right too. The ambience is very conducive for families too. So don''t think twice - just give MTR a try and I'm sure it won't be for once only
5
A short walking distance away from the crowd of Syed Alwi Road, opposite Perumal Swamy Temple on Serangoon Road, near exit H of Farrer Park MRT station is where this small restaurant is located. Very neat, clean and pleasant atmosphere topped with excellent service. Menu: I highly appreciate the fact that the spread on their menu is limited. Most other restaurants in Little India serve a mix of south Indian, north Indian, Indo-Chinese and anything that can be called Indian. But MTR sticks to the tradition and serves only what they are best at! So expect to find only the typical and traditional stuff (no North Indian, no Indo-Chinese, no chaat). My husband and I love South Indian and we always stuck to the Tamil based restaurants. At MTR, were pleasantly surprised by the change in flavors of basic dishes like coconut chutney and rasam and sambar. The Karnataka flavors truly pleased our palate. We really enjoyed the tangy and spicy flavors of Sambar vada, Bisi-bhele bath, the Masala dosa and of course Rawa Idly was classic ! The weekend special meals is my favorite - a wholesome south Indian meal. To wrap up this feast with their curd rice and lime pickle is heavenly! I need to still go back there to taste the other tempting dishes on their Menu 
2
When I first saw MTR I was super excited and stepped in and ordered quite a few items thinking that it would be as good as what it used to taste during my childhood days in Bangalore, but turned out to be disappointing. Even the coffee did not live up to its original standard. But Rava Idli saved my day, there is lot of room for improvement
4
Have been to this restaurant more than a couple of times just to eat the Rava Iddli which is a speciality and tastes very good. Also other items like Bisabhalla Bath, Tamarind Rice - eating them brings back memories of how these dishes used to taste when we ate them in our younger years. The ambience is nice, service is good and the wait for food is not too long though this can do with some improvement
3
We visited MTR sometime back when we had been to the temple in that road. Seeing the brand name MTR, we poked in to try there. But in my opinion, the food is little expensive than the average price. The quality is okay, not so good as the Indian version. The service is good. When we ordered few items, later sometime they checked in the kitchen and politely told us to select other food, as the speciifc was already over by then.Overall, they could reduce the price a little bit and increase the quality little bit
4
We had delicious food here.Ambiance is nice and is having comfortable space. Food taste is pretty good. It serves pure south indian food in different variety.Menu: South Indian, limited north indian itemsSpecial Item: Podi Masala DosaPricing: averageService : good.Location is good. Inside city area. Nearby Little India Area. Nearby Train Station: Ferrer Par
4
One of the finest vegetarian stuff I eaten with my family at Singipore
where it is difficult to get a pure 100% vegetatian restra without egg and meat.
3
The food is very good here no question, but it is a little bit on the expensive side. Also they do not accept credit cards. The service used to be good, getting a little average or below when I visited them last time.
5
I love eating here and come regularly especially for the masala dosa. It's so delicious , well priced and also the restaurant is clean. Food comes quickly and service is super efficient. A definite must for South Indian Cuisine!
2
The food is not value for money. For the price that they charge, the quantity is very little and the food is on the sweeter side, which is not to my liking. I have not had sweet South Indian food!! This place is just hyped up. There are better options nearby
5
We have eaten here a couple of times for lunch at the weekend. It is a no frills restaurant but clean and welcoming. The place is always busy and that must be because the food is so good! Neither my husband or I are vegetarian but the food here is so delicious and flavoursome that we will keep coming back. The owner is incredibly friendly and always helps advise us on what to have from the menu as we are not familiar with a lot of the dishes. I recommend this place, it's really good value and the masala dosa is fantastic
4
We stepped out of the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Singapore, and right opposite we saw the MTR restaurant. As my wife is a pure vegetarian, it was an immediate choice. After seeing the hawker centres with there abundance of meat dishes, she was searching for a good vegetarian restaurant and one where we get Indian food. MTR restaurant has excellent food and service. The taste is similar to any other MTR. Having tasted the food regularly at the flagship restaurant at Bangalore, the taste at the MTR at Singapore is not too different. Thanks MTR for bringing back memorie
5
The only place where in Singapore where we get delicious south indian breakfast and meals with appropriate hygiene. This food reminds me the olden days in Bengaluru everytime i visit this place. Needless to say they are YUMMY ! On a Saturday and Sunday Morning it feels like you are in Bengaluru sipping the morning filter coffee with people chatting in Kannada in the background !
4
location - opposite a Hindu temple along the street else if you get lest in Little India, everyone knows the resto anyway.... just ask! :)premise - cleaner than the one in Bangalore and no smell from the open kitchen cooking.staff - friendly and fastfood - nice! a tad too salty for our liking but still good vegetarian foodcrowd - everyone and anyone, this resto is an open arm to guestsverdict - good. but of course when compared to the Bangalore store, the price is easily 5 times more. Portion are same however
3
We were one among the few when we entered. Not sure why Dosa took too much time, other dishes came at reasonable time. If you have tried Karnataka food before and you like try entering inside. My family did not like it as they were expecting Tamil Nadu type dishes. Pongal is completely a different dish here. Rava Idli is worth the tr
5
The only place where in Singapore where you get dosas, Idlli, vada and all the good eating stuff exactly as in Bengaluru ! Needless to say they are YUMMY ! On a Saturday and Sunday Morning it feels like you are in Bengaluru sipping the morning filter coffee with people chatting in Kannada in the background !!
4
I wanted the typical Bangalore breakfast, and was fully satisfied with its service, quality and wide variety of breakfast dishes and we feel the we are in Bangalore.
Very clean and service is fast and the place is maintained neatly.
Must try when in singapore
5
Good choice of very tasty food and snacks. Fast and efficient service. Very clean compared to similar places in Little India.
4
Good south Indian foods, more Mysoru style.
Crowded on weekends, book before or be prepared to wait.
Had rice thali and masala dosas, went with friend family. had special orders for child too.
5
Always feel welcome, always best service and always the most hygienic and clean India restaurant. Food is delicious and nutritious and quality the best in Singapore.
5
On arrival the man behind the till helped us with our food order. I think he may have been the owner. He was really knowledgable and helped us order the right amount of food, I really respect that he didn't get us to try and over order. We sat down and the waiting staff were so attentive. The food was absolutely delicious and came with wonderfully paired sauces and chutneys. My favourite was the Ragi Dosa it was amazing. We ended up with 3 dishes to share between the 2 of us, 2 drinks and my husband had a desert and the totally was $30. A lovely friendly restaurant where the staff make you want to come back again
5
I went there, because I read many good reviews about this place. I wasn't disappointed at all! The owner helped me choose the food, it was cheap, served very fast and it was delicious! I totally recommend this place. Mind that the place is quite small and due to its popularity might be hard to find a place to sit, you might need to wait quite a time before getting a seat.
5
We used to live in South India (Chennai) and our kids really miss Dosa. They were so happy to have perfect, golden and crisp dosa here. I also really enjoyed their bisibelle bath. Thank you for a great experience. We only stayed 3 days, but ate here on two of them
5
First time at MTR restaurant and the food jus exploded beautifully in our mouth. We had rava dosa which was simply yummy, rava idli was soft and melted in our mouth. dhal rice was out superb. my Friends and I had a very satisfying lunch. Thanks to MT
5
It was the best vegetarian South Indian food I had in Singapore. The food was tasty with fresh aromatic spices and ingredients. The ambience was good and the service was excellent. Surprisingly, the prices were less and the food was better than other restaurants where I had a chance to eat similar kind of food.Would recommend it
5
I came here with my family. We had spent a week in Singapore and only found this place the last day we were here. The food was AMAZING!! It was very clean. Mr Srinivas Rao was very patient and explained all the dishes and made some fantastic recommendations. I would definitely come back on my next visit to Singapore. Trust me, you will have no regrets!
5
I went to MTR yesterday lunchtime with my friends.
As always this place is very popular, however the service of the staff and quality of the food are excellent. Highly recommended ;)
5
Perfect introduction to an authentic India breakfast with my parents. Great service with a smile. I'll be back soon for sure.
5
Our second visit to MTR was just as good as our first. The bisibele bhath, avalakki bhath and rava masala dosa were all incredibly fresh and delicious and teamed well with the mango lassi. We are looking forward to eating there again.
5
My taste buds are still craving for those wonderful dosas. I stayed for 7 days and had food at MTR for almost all the meals. Starting from breakfast to dinner. The Pudi Masala Dosa was one of its kind and a unique dosa .
4
The old established MTR in Bangalore now has a prodigy in Little India,Singapore.Neat, compact, efficient, reasonably priced,it boasts of the same goodies as its older cousin in Bangalore and does a great job with its preparations. I tried the iconic favourite, the Beli Besli Bhat and was just the right quantity and very good.Leaves very little in comparison for the competitors who now will need to work harder!Well done MTR
5
MTR is an awesome restaurant that serves vegetarian Indian food in little India. Although I am not a big fan of vegetarian food, I can definitely classify this meal as one of the best. The service is perfect, the staff extremely nice and the place super clean. It is also very affordable (Count about 5 SGD for one dish, you need 3 to 4 dishes for 2 persons), which is not easy to find in Singapore.Definitely recommended
4
One of the finest South Indian food I had in Singapore. Had the special set meal that comes with dosa, bisi bele bath and thali. I could not believe I had this much food for my lunch.At the end of my meal, I wanted to eat more :) A must visit place for everyone who enjoys South Indian vegetarian food :) Am looking forward to visit MTR again 
5
Well , having lived in oz Land for couple of years and being served the regular curry in hurry by all Indian restaurants all over ... This was a refreshing change on my taste buds me and my wife ordered idly , masala dosa , set dosa and sambar vada.Each dish had the same succinct ethereal taste the dish had to embody ..It was not hot spicy or whatever ....it was just right ... Well for those of you who enjoy music.. The right South Indian classical music (ragas) were playing in the background ... It was not overpowering ..We had a lovely date with a table for two at this restaurant...In summary if you are searching for food which touches your soul .. You know the relation of the food should be between you and the brain and it should say yummoooo.. Do you know what I mean ? Then this is the place for yo

I was reading the Singapore best restaurants list in Tripadvisor when I saw this ranked as 2nd in the list. I honestly think that would be heavily biased.Last year I stayed in Little India and spend a lunch here. Sadly, I did not quite enjoy it. Of course MTR 1924 was a far more clean establishment than the usual South Indian vegetarian eating house you may find at the corner of streets, but taste-wise, I was underwhelmed. I ordered vegetarian thali, and everything was so salty, lacking balance. Price-wise it was very affordable though.Will have to visit again to see if it was only bad luck

being a regular visitor to singpore, make it a point to visit MTR every time i am here .Great food and great ambience.service is quick and friendly.Many of my singaporean friends have become regulaot visitors now.The serice, the quality , the hygeine and ambience is well maintained over the past years,I would strongly recommend mtr to any one with a liking for indian vegetarian foo
5
I recommend this place for those who loves vegetarian food like me, try the best Dosa like Masala Dosa, Rava Masala Dosa, Set Dosa and variety of Rice dishes.quick service. Restaurant is kept very clean and neat.
5
Best experience !! Great food & great ambience....simply loved it. Excellent service and very very friendly staff. Felt so much at home....Almost everything is super quick and super tasty....what I missed in Bangalore I got in Singapore.....just go for it....Bisibelebath remains their best !!!
4
Great friendly place for vegetarian tiffin. Excellent yogurt rice and chai.
They have daily specials so there is always something refreshing

Went with my 5 yr old daughter. And here is what she had to say. :-)
"I like the white dosas and the button idly. Ummmmm. What else?
I want to eat the idlies and polities everyday. I looooove the gulab jamuns"
5
It honestly took me back to Bangalore! Fabulous food! They've toned it down to a bit to Singapore palates, but still awesome! Must visit place..
5
Excellent food and consistent Quality.... Service is very good. Each dish has its own flavour profile unlike other restaurants where they tend to be very similar. The Lunch set meal is a great value.
Must Try and must keep visiting again and again !!
5
Ate here several times, mostly breakfast - Rava Idli, Masala Dosa, and buttermilk. Very clean, and staff very helpful. Thanks Rao !
5
this is my favorite South Indian breakfast place! The idlis melt in your mouth and the bisebele bhath is absolutely delicious. The dosas are different and outstanding in their own way. All in all this is simple and irressitable food and I keep going back for more
5
Came here for lunch and had our order taken and found a seat. Was like no other curry we'd ever had in our life. We chose one of the set menus. Had no idea what we really had but it was amazing! I wanted another portion and couldn't believe on how good value it was and that it was vegetarian
4
You cannot find a better place in Singapore if you are fond of south indian food... i am a Sindhi but i love south Indian food... Me and my wife visited this place and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner... Perfect Perfect Perfect place for any meal...
5
Was I singapore for 4 days & went almost 2 times a day at mtr .
Guys this place serves superb South Indian fare.
Bisibelle bhat, khara bhat , idli , dosas etc. badam halva & g jamuns r superb. Keep it up
5
We regularly go to MTR as me and my husband are in love with the food at MTR. By far the best place for South Indian cuisine in Singapore...
4
It was late and we were searching for an Indian restaurant for dinner when we dropped in to this restaurant. The value for money is good and the food is not outstanding but definitely good.
4
6 of us went there for brunch. Had South indian "tiffin"....idlis, dosa , vada etc. taste and service was good. Located centrally. Total was 53 sing dollars. It was a Sunday but managed to get a table for 6 as we were there by 11am.
5
Great, fresh and outstanding quality !! Fantastic service - a must go place for great South Indian Food in Singapore!!!
5
We have been impressed with the fare ditched out at MTR. Staff are courteous, food is simple yet delicious, extremely hygienic and they politely warn you if you over order. Just avoid on Sundays as the queues can test your patience
3
When in little India, do as the Romans! Great breakfast choices very fast service and clean.
Had dosa for breakfast topped off with a steam cup of masala tea.
5
Come eat here ... you will enjoy the tastiest vegetarian meal south of Chennai, delicious and plentiful - if you spend more than $15.00 a head inc drinks you have ordered too much. Can I suggest for lunch for two - order the Set Meal (Thali) with a Rava Idly , a plain Dosa and a Bisbele Bhath., ample food for two and definitely get an Indian filtered coffee each - thank me later I know you will .....TBel
4
This place looks like any bust South Indian vegetarian place from outside. Inside is nice and clean compared to some of theatre places locally. The food was excellent and service was quick and efficient. The prices were surprisingly low and very affordable- unusual for Singapore. I highly recommend this place for decent vegetarian food in Singapore right in the Little India
5
firstly this review is written after my visit to MTR every single day ; during my 30 days stay at singapore. i literally eat every meal from here even if it means take a parcel to home or office. So expressing my honest opinion here.the key points to note are -1. it's neat and clean and the management keeps it tidy all the time2. the taste is very good and they maintain the standards of mtr3. it's closest to ferrer park mrt and its opposite to srinivas perumal temple.it breaks my heart to write anything bad about this place - but i am forced to express my opinion - 1. it is closed on mondays2. there is only 1 branch in singaporei hope the management takes these feedback constructivelyNeedless to say that the staff is so cooperative and friendly. The manager is the best, he is always smiling and keeps a lively environment even when hundreds flock into the restaurent during public holidays and weekends. Management definatly need to note this point.i see just not indians flocking this place, but also a lot foriegners and even local citizens just to have a masala dosa or chai or the best coffee. Its just truley awesome place and i will cherish it for a long tim
5
Food plays a vital role when we are on holidays, especially with small kids as they are very picky. At MTR in Singapore we had the best food, ambience, time and hospitality. Thanks to all the guys. Keep up the spirit!!!
5
Neatness & great taste, characteristics of MTR is well kept. Friendly staff. Definite visit whenever we are in little India. Best option for Veg South Indian.
5
Traditional indian food, good standard of hygiene, my fav vegetarian restaurant In Little India. It can be crowded In The evening so come early to reserve your seats! There are special meals every day of the week! Try idlis ! Great taste & service & cleanliness
5
A stone's throw away from City Square Mall, This is a good place for authentic south Indian food - by which I mean good Karnataka (India) Food - not to be confused with Chennai/Tamil Nadu. There is a subtle difference in flavour n preparations for the well travelled tourist. You'll know when you have the sambar here!MTR is a popular joint in India (mainly South) and known for its good quality food, which is healthy and nutritious at the right price - ie. does not burn a hole in pocket. MTR has good standards of maintaining hygiene and its good to see the same level in this Singapore joint.A meal for two at under $20 - go for their set meals or ask for Mr Rao (Manager) for recommendations. Regular or Masala Tea is a must-have for Tea Lovers. The filter coffee is genuine coffee imported from MTR maintained farms in India!! The Interiors are plain and simple, table and chairs. Comfy enough. Aircon and brightly lit. This is a genuine vegetarian joint, so meat eaters look somewhere else! Great place for breakfast lunch tea-time & dinner. This is not fine-dining, but a decent joint for good food n reasonable price (I'd say cheaper than most joints which suffer in quantity/quality of food vs price)

We all know about Singaporeâ€¦and we are also ever appreciative about the sense or order there, the cleanliness, the civic sense of Singaporeans, the tourist attractions and the courtesy and fine behavior of the people. When it comes to starting your day in Singapore...especially Breakfast, I would never like to miss the mouth watering South Indian tiffin items served by MTR Restaurant on Serangoon Road. Visitors, please look out for MTR Restaurant and enjoy your breakfast. Madhavan KunnathChennai (Mob : +91 9962200769

MTR Singapore is a boon for all South Indian Vegetarian foodlovers. Ideally located on Serangoon Road ( Little India) exactly opposite Sri Srinivasa Perumal temple, the restaurant serves authentic MTR cuisines in a very clean and hygienic manner. Staff are extremely courteous and try to accommodate the requirements of overflowing patrons on weekends. I believe this is one of the very few restaurants where food is served fresh and not retained beyond a few hours. Prices are reasonable and it is definitely value for money- in terms of taste, service, cleanliness, location and authenticity. Please note that the restaurant is closed on Mondays and open from 8.30 am to 3pm and again from 5.30 pm to 10pm on all other days
4
Top stuff. Taste of Bangalore in Singapore. No frills, busy place. I crave for Bangalore dosas and vadas and this almost always hits the right spot. The masala dosa, vada, rav aidly, rava dosa are all excellent. There's specials everyday so lots to try on repeat visits. Occasionally erratic, but its mostly our go-to place for this food. Always recommended
4
We were in Singapore on a holiday from the US and were thrilled to discover MTR. The food was excellent and it felt like we were eating in Bangalore. Thoroughly enjoyed the masala dosas, poori-sagu, bisi belle bhath. In fact, we liked it so much that we went back the next day for more. I strongly recommend this place
5
MTR to me is an exponent of South Indian vegetarian food. I am not vegetarian but this food makes me want to become 100% veg. But mtr is not just about great south Indian food, it's about great food, period. No nonsense just a passion for producing the best every day. If only more restaurants were like that. I will miss the dosa, the besibele bath, the poor and chapati, the amazing sambhar & gravy's. My only regret is I won't be in Singapore long enough to eat more items off the menu. Mtr makes me happy
5
This place serves some great South Indian dishes made in bengaluru style. While the taste is near authentic and the staff is very friendly I found the pricing to be on the higher side. A single piece of Rava Idli is priced at $4. Despite this MTR is one of my favourite restaurant here in Singapore. You my definitely try the Poori Sagu, Kara Bath, Kesari Bath & thali
5
Really really fantastic food, extremely affordable and lovely service. Wish we were in Singapore for longer so that we could go again.
5
Authentic south indian food with the fresh ingredients. Very reasonably priced. Def recommended for south indian food lovers.
5
This evening I have tried the best Indian food in Singapore!
No doubt that I will come back more times.
Cheap and tasteful food.
4
MTR knows the taste of south India, the south Indian food here is awesome. Must try are the rava idli and masala dosa. V.good food and excellent service.
4
this resto plus the one in front of it are good hawkers to go to. inidan and muslim and thai food combined. clean and helpful staff. i believe they have the same owners
5
Wow, 300 reviews can be wrong. Amazing food super fresh. You order and pay as you enter, but it goes fast. Very clean place too, atypical for little India. Would eat here again, and again, and again, and I am not vegetarian.
5
We took the risk of vacationing in Singapore with a 4 year old fussy eater. First 1 day my son did not have any food. Every place we went put him off either due to the smell or the ambience.We then found MTR and he loved the food. For 7 days we had every meal at MTR. Excellent food, excellent service and reasonably priced. We did not miss the MTR at Bangalore. Thanks MTR for making our stay at singapore a present one.
5
Had lunch here. Very flavoursome authentic South Indian food. Have had food in South India and this compares very favourably. Very clean restaurant as evidenced by their A rating and very helpful and attentive staff especially Mr Rao (hope I have the right spelling) who took the time to explain the various dishes and make recommendations. We'll visit again and strongly recommend this restaurant
4
We had a wonderful meal!Delicious food and very friendly staff. We weren't sure what to order but the manager helped us to put together a selection of signature dishes from the menu. The recommendations were excellent and exactly the right amount for two. A great way to start a epicurious adventure through Singapore
4
In Singapore there are no shortage of Indian restaurants and in Little India it can be hard to choose from all the options available. However MTR Restaurant of providing a very consistent experience in a nice clean, friendly environment.This is a strictly vegetarian restaurant with no alcohol served so options are quite simple and economical. A dish of Masala dosa was perfectly spiced with the dosa component constructed with a nice wholemeal type of flour, quite different from my previous experiences. There are many set meals and daily specials available so it's nice to try something different each time
5
Had recently visited MTR original tiffin rooms in Bangalore. Food here is just as good - the secret is that they import the ingredients from Bangalore!!
4
MTR in Bangalore is unique restaurant,track record of over fifty years..famous for dosa ,idli.if you want all that at good price head to this restaurant in Singapore you will not be disappointed..good value for money,very clean..have a heartybangalore dosa..you will love it
4
I always wanted to eat at MTR Bangalore but never got the opportunity. When I was in Singapore in June 2013, I managed to do so.
Very good South Indian food made with ghee. Hence, tends to be tasty but a bit rich.
4
This place is a very southern indian which does great food. The dosas were absoluitely great and they were very reasonably priced. This is plainly one for any visit to singapore.
3
The food quality was good. We had Raggi dosa, bisibilla bath and meals. All were average, not great.
5
Really good authentic south indian food at a ridiculously cheap price. If you just want to eat loads and spend barely anything this is definitely the place.
5
We have been looking for Vegetarian restaurant in Singapore on trip advisor. The person on the counter not only welcomed us but help to choose the South Indian food also. We ordered verity of food, and everything's beyond goodness. Pure southern test and prices were very reasonable. Entire staff was very attentive. Great service and great food. 5star to the restaurant. Keep it up
5
MTR is a complete restaurant for people who value good food cooked the old fashioned way. The menu is simple and the focus is on excellence. The staff is polite and efficient. The food is delectable and tasty Would recommend the following dishes- rawa idli- bissebile bhaat- plain dosa. This is very different from anywhere else- curd riceThe coffee is the best way to round off a perfect meal. Will come again and agai
4
While the ambiance leaves much be desired - and this is a common complaint for most Indian restaurants, specially the southern food variety - the food and flavour can't be faulted. The staff also do their best to be accommodating. This is what draws me back to the restaurant quite often. Their dosas are not the typical Udipi restaurant style (don't ask for modern distortions like "prepare" dosa and so on!) but they are excellent and the chutneys and sambas are not diluted. Want something more substantial? Try the South Indian Meal - a set Thali (a large stainless steel plate) loaded with variety and delicious flavour
5
We're not vegetarians or of Indian background, but we found Serangoon Street's MTR in Little India to be a unique and fantastic experience. The humble, southern Indian vegetarian restaurant provided food that was delicious, inexpensive and served by a friendly, smiley, waiter who was very helpful in explaining dishes we were unfamiliar with. We'd definitely return to MTR the next time in Singapore
3
Liked: the atmosphere and popularity with local Indians.
Liked: cheap (about 5 dollars pp!!), very clean and cheerful.
Liked: tasty.
Disliked: lack of fresh veg choices. The menu is highly carb-based: bread, bread, bread, rice, rice, rice.
5
We ate for five days in various Indian restaurants in India, but none stood up to the quality, cleanliness, and taste of food at MTR!!! The prices were affordable too.
5
If you want to eat good South-Indian food then this is the place to go in Singapore. You can check it out and you will definitely be satisfied with the food and experience.
4
MTR is a good old famous restaurant in Bangalore, India.
I happened to search for Mustafa 24 hours shopping centre, incidentally I found this restaurant
and had a veg dinner.
I was fascinated to see MTR at Singapore. The food was good......authentic South Indian !!
5
The best South Indian authentic food, the taste will take you back home.
One thing I would like to highlight is the hygiene at the resto is ***** star, I am very pleased and impressed.
Please open MTR in Australia.
5
Clean and Well maintained. MRT food always good in quality. I visited many restaurants in little india but this made me to feel having real south indian food. Located exactly opposite to perumal temple is a nice landmark.
5
After a few hours visiting the temples of Little India, I saw this restaurant across the street. It appealed to me as it is a vegetarian only restaurant, so I crossed over. Very good decision. We were made very welcome by extremely friendly staff and the food choices were extensive. Great value for money and we were also allowed to try things before we ordered and were given extras at no charge. Definitely recommend this place
4
MTR Bangalore as well and surprised to see same in little india Singapore . The quality, taste, Service, Humbleness of each employee is same as what I what you will get in Bangalore.By this time, I had visited other Veg restaurants in same area (as this place is known for Indian things), I concluded this is the place where I continue to come unless finishes all variety of the Veg food they offer.Cleanliness Excellent (They always set benchmark to others)Taste Excellent (This is what I say as original Vegetarian South food)Service Excellent (All employee greet with smile and very humble)Price - Don't know if we get cheaper with such qualityVERY TASTY FOOD Served Hot with smell of freshness, with a gentle smile on face.
4
MTR food is asusal got amazing taste. I love Bisibele Bath a lot and MTR delivered and exceeded my expectation on the taste. Suppliers was talking in Kannada and I felt that I am in Bangalore. Kannadigas Please visit and others for taste and enjoy the food
5
Visited MTR on several occasions during our Singapore visit and thoroughly enjoyed the food every time. It was authentic and consistently very good. Every dish (esp. try bisibele bath and curd vada) was delicious and had a home cooked taste. The location is clean and has a pleasant ambience. It is the best South Indian restaurant in Singapore and a definite must go
5
The south indian food that they have here is one of the best in Singapore. Definitely need to go here to try the dishes. Also try the lassi and dosas.
4
Thanks Tripadvisor for leading us to this restaurant! Wonderful food and good service. The masala dosa and bissibela bath is to die for.
5
If you have tasted South Indian food and not been to an MTR, you really havent!
The Masala Dosa is something else. Rava Idly is to die for. Must visit again
5
On my recent trip I visited MTR Singapore which opened about 18 months ago. A huge welcome to an area of mediocre deteriorating restaurants on Serangoon road. Excellent coffee, great food and very clean. Will go back again. Welcome to Singapore, MTR! I am a huge fan of MTR in Bengaluru and they have done a good job emulating it in Singapore
5
We had a fantastic set meal today at the MTR. The food was very fresh and quick to arrive. The menu is different every day and the service was excellent. The cashier was more than happy to give us an extra bowl of one of the sauces which we found particularly delicious. The masala tea and payasam where particularly delicious. It was such a pleasure to enjoy a wonderful vegetarian meal in the heart of little indi
4
Loved the food which was reasonably priced and plentiful. We had the set meal, a masala dosa and the idly with two soft drinks for about $25, highly recommend all of the food and that was enough for 2. Only reason it's not a 5 is because they seemed to be closing and we felt a little like we were being rushed out though the waiter did take time to explain what the dishes were which was helpful
5
This restaurant changes the stereotype of south indian restaurants in Singapore being very basic and stall like. I went there for breakfast with a business colleague. The dish choices are excellent, very well presented and served, has a bit of restaurant history on the walls, service is warm and efficient (can't say i have found both together in a lot of places). My favourite dishes are the Rava idli, Utthappam & Khara baath
5
We really liked our lunch in this restaurant. The restaurant was full and we were the only non Indian there. Despite having some issues with the spice, the food was really nice. Thanks to TripAdvisor for taking us to this restaurant in the Little India in Singapore
2
As i went for takeaway... I had an unpleasant encounter with the cashier... When i ordered my food for takeaway, he got my order wrong and when i changed it later on... There was more confusion, so what i kind of didnt like was that he didnt say sorry for anything, nor did he smile during service
5
Stumped with real treat of vegetarian food in Singapore! Must order Idly, Set Dosa, Masala Dosa, Wada with Sambar real soft inside, served hot on table accompanied with various choice of unlimited chutney,sambar very tasty with minimal chillies! Best part is these authentic dishes without oil dripping out. Very personalised efficient service. Visit on 8th November'14 with family to remember for long time.
5
Excellent and inexpensive south indian restaurant (I believe the only one in Singapore), clean environment, speedy service. The Masala Dosa is my favorite!
4
Good Indian vegetarian food, excellent masala dosa.
Staff pushy when you order, and rated number 5 because they give you a tripadvisor biz card and ask you to review (good ploy!)
But no complaints. Other veg indian restaurants nearby worth a look too.
4
Very clean restaurant and friendly staffs. Enjoyed the food very much. Prices are very reasonable. Worth the try. Will go there again to eat.
4
We had dinner at this place. We tasted various delicacies of kanada dishes. There are some interesting writeups on the origin of some of the recipes.
5
Fantastic experience! Ordered the chow chow bath, bisibelebath, dahi vada, masala dosa and the rava dosa!! Everything was wonderful!
The service was amazing as well! Very welcoming staff!
Will definitely come back .. often!

While roaming around Liitle India in Singapore, I found this place. I have been to MTR Bangalore as well and surprised to see same in Singapore.

4
Good:-Appeared on local TV, adds credit to their reputation overnight.-Appeals to the healthy crowd who want to abstain from eating meat.Bad:-Not pleasing for first timers like me who are new to the cuisine.-Does not have a pleasing ambience to sustain a long meal, this place is meant for a quick meal
5
Had gone to MTR after reading reviews, and it was worth the extra walk from Mustafa Centre. Organised system of ordering. Very good and helpful manager who helped us customise the food according to our daughter's needs. Hot and yummy food was served.We came back again for dinner after shopping at Mustafa's... since the experience for lunch was too good. There is rush towards evening and little bit waiting is there. The staff is very courteous and this made us go back again for dinner another night for dinner at MTR's during our week long stay in Singapore.Highly recommended for South Indian Food and some Hot / Cold Badam Milk...Cheers

We found out about this restaurant through Tripadvisor and made our way there on a busy Sunday just before Deepavali - call us crazy. We arrived about 1pm and were lucky to get a table right away. This restaurant is very busy so be prepared to wait. You stand at a counter to order and pay, they give you a number and then you wait for a table. Because it is so popular it is very lively and noisy so don't expect an intimate meal. We ordered the set meal which came in two stages - the first was a dhosa which was tasty, but, I felt, small; however, when the rest of the meal came, it was so generous in portion that I could not finish my meal. My husband had a mango lassi which was good enough to warrant a second one.I think the food was authentic South Indian flavours. My husband enjoyed his meal very much. I felt that the meal was just ok. I have to mention that I had digestive discomfort for a day afterwards which may or may not be related - nothing severe but symptoms nonetheless.The staff were friendly but extremely busy and we had to pay attention that we received our complete order.All in all, an interesting experience in Little India but not one I am certain I would repeat
5
Excellent food with the authentic taste of MTR. Very close to the actual MTR back in Bangalore. Highly recommended for Bangloreans who miss the Masala dosa and Vada from back home. For others, please visit MTR to experience what food in Bangalore tastes like :DPS : Do not forget to try the Gulam Jamoon (feel the kapur/camphor aroma in it) and Chandra-Haar; very unique tastes which will always linger in your mouth
5
In Singapore, I was flown back to Bengaluru just with the taste of MTR food. The Pongal , Bisibelebath and Masala Dosa were out of the world. Look for no other place if you want to have South Indian food in Singapore
4
Really good food. Quick and friendly service. Food was fresh. Great price. I'll come here again - well worth it.
4
We went late ard 10pm and they were closing. I am not a big fan of Karnataka food though. The taste and quality was very good and close to what you get in B'lore. 5-10$ per person.
5
We really enjoyed our meal here. Very friendly owner who explained the menu to us. Very tasty food. Reasonably priced and very clean environment. Only negative is that is closed on Mondays.
5
I joined my family who was travelling from India to Singapore for a vacation from United States. I was reminded back to Bangalore MTR with the authenticity and taste of the food. The manager of the restaurant was greeting everyone personally and making sure the customers are being taken care of. The Sambar, Rasam, Puri and Payasa had the same taste that I cherished in Bangalore. To end my meal, I ordered a cup of coffee... It was the best filter coffee. I would recommend this place to any one who is looking to have South Indian food in Singapore
5
I was most intrigued to visit this restaurant since it was on no. 5 of Trip Advisers review of almost 7200 restaurants in singapore.Sevice is very fast. Start with either a idli or vada, a dosa and filter coffee or those with a sweet tooth, a gulab jamun is recommended. It is closed on Mondays and closed between 3.30 to 5.30 pm. Sunday afternoon is really crowded. Absolute value for money
4
I read on TripAdvisor that this restaurant has a good reputation not only for locals but also for tourists. I checked the map and found that MTR is located in a walking distance from the hostel I stayed. So I decided to give it a go. I arrived at around 11 am so there were many available seats. I was greeted by a fine old man, I suspected he was one of the owners of the restaurant or at least the caretaker. He must notice that I was a tourist and not really understand Indian dishes. He said to me that I better try a meal package called meal-poori because with it I could try many options of the restaurant. I said yes to him. It turned out that the meal was delicious. I liked almost everything on it except the coconut yoghurt (if I correctly understood). The service was efficient. People come and go constantly showing how popular this palace is. The music I heard is like classic Indian songs, I loved it because they sound proper for the restaurant and do not disturb your concentration while eating ( I hate loud music in restaurant). On the walls you can see information on the special dishes and the history of the MTR. There are station for washing hands because you are expected to use hands for eating at Indian restaurants. Fresh water is available for free on every table. Very nice! It is located opposite Perumal Temple, near farreer Park MRT station
5
This week was my second visit in two months when I come to Singapore from Sydney. Both times the food was par excellence. The place is very clean, service very courteous and with minimal decorations. The set dosa was just divine as is other items we tried. The vada was done to perfection. The Mysore masala was not crispy, may be it is done like that. This Tuesday at lunch time there were only two servers and the manager was serving and clearing the plates. It shows that customer service is much more than dignity of labour. Keep up the good work and you will be appreciated much more
5
We ate here on our last night in Singapore. It was bustling and busy with lots of locals who obviously frequent the restaurant. The staff were fantastic, very helpful with recommendations on what to eat, service was quick and it was excellent value for money. We ate a number of dishes: Dosas, lentils, potatoes - it was all hot and delicious. We highly recommend it
5
Good SouthIndian food , Liked it for the Food , not spicey at all and cleanliness .felt assured that if we eat there will not fall ill . Service, Aircon etc all was very good .People managing it are friendly -so basically no complaints 
5
Just had dinner here following the good reviews on TA and, boy, this place is good -the number of people attending this restaurant speaks by itself.. Try the masala dosa with a mango lassi, you won't regret it! :-)
3
Hotel is closer to serangoon road, one can enjoy karnataka food for a change. Prices are little bit higher side
4
This is a must visit. Nice food, very clean place and nice satisfaction to the taste buds.
PS: Its a South Indian Cuisine place.
5
Look no further if anyone is looking for authentic indian vegetarian breakfast/lunch/dinner.
The quality of food is excellent. We tried Rava idly, Ragi dosa, Masala Dosa etc. This should be part of your food trail. Don't miss it.
5
We stopped by at 4 PM on Saturday and saw the sign said they closed at 3 PM and would reopen at 5:30 PM. A Gentleman came out and apologized but sad to come back at 5:00 PM so we did. A friend recommended masala dosa, so we ordered two, bisibele bhath, and kharabhath. The masala dosa was quite good, crunchy on one side, chewy on tho other, stuffed with well seasoned potatoes and served with two sauces. Bisibeli bhath is a rice and vegetable stew served with yogurt sauce, ghee, and crackers which I forget the name of. My favorite was kharabhath. It is a highly seasoned, savory, cake of semolina, stuffed with curry leaves and garnished with tomato. The service was excellent. Our server answered all of our questions, and repeated himself when we could not understand. The restaurant was completely full at 5:30 PM on Saturday. This could be every Saturday, or just Saturdays during Deepavali. I like that the food was served at just the right intervals, each dish coming out as we finished the previous.The prices are not on the menu, this is very strange to me. Compared to places nearby, MTR is more expensive. I cannot compare the quality of food or service as I have not eaten in any of these other restaurants, but I can say that the ambiance in MTR is better, and I had no problem with the prices.Overall this was a great experience, but remember, I am American and likely wouldn't know the difference between good, authentic Indian food and the typical fare served in Indian restaurants in America, though I have it on good authority (Indian friend) that MTR is the real deal and quite good

The taste of food in this restaurant is very good no doubt.. It's a great place to have Karnataka food in Singapore.. Now coming to the negatives.. It can get really crowded! The food is really very very expensive compared to other places though they claim they use the best ingredients, still I feel it is over priced. The worst thing is about the special meals that is served here.. Priced at 12$ I was really expecting something amazing.. It turned out to be a miniature version of a thali.. Idli sized dosa! N just a few spoons of rice was served.. I mean just a few spoons!! Mixed feelings about this restaurant. Though will never have the "special" meals here again

This was a great value vegetarian indian restaurant which served great tasting food. We ordered the set lunch menu - $8 each - our combined food bill was less than a bottle of water at the restaurant we went to the night before :). This was a really tasty selection of little dishes with curries, desserts, nibbles, rice and chapati. Overall great value, tasty and served with a smile by the friendly staff. We didn't go until the last day of our visit, but if we had gone earlier in our holiday we would have eaten there more than once

Went here to eat masala dosa with great expectations.Nothing was wrong with it as such. It was fresh, clean etc.However, the taste was very average. Also, the amount of "masala" aka "potato" inside was not enough. Also the quantity of sambhar in first instance was very less. However, it was filled up again without a problem.Also, had "curd rice". Pretty average as well.The person sitting on the counter is however super nice, super friendly and had excellent attitude.Its closed on Mondays!Hope this helps you make a decision?If this review was helpful, please click on the "yes, the review was helpful" tab

Recently on a trip to Singapore visited MTR four times, because this is the best place for a vegetarian south indian meal. Had breakfast , brunch, lunch and evening coffee with snacks. So tried lot of preprations and found them very good. A thali meal cost 8 Singapore dollars(served only at lunch time) while an idly or cup of lovely strong filter coffee cost 2 Singapore dollars most of the snacks are priced between 2 to 6 singapore dollars One has to first place an order and pay you are given a number to display on your table and the food is served which is very good specially when there is rush.The place is neat and clean staff very courteous,When I visit Singapore again I am sure this is one place I would like to have most of my meals.The restaurant is close to the City Square Mall and if travelling by mrt one should get down at Farrer Park and follow the exit which takes you to city square mall and MTR is just a five min walk from the Mall. It opens at 8.30 am and it is closed for a break for 2 hrs at 3.30pm . Monday is an off day for the restaurant. If going on a week end reach early to avoid rush
5
Not my first visit, but now all the kinks have been ironed out. The food is superb, service prompt, and coffee excellent. Even the prices seem to have been toned down a bit, so it's great value for money whether you are having their meals at $8/- or dosas/puris etc. Haven't ventured into their dessert menu , afraid that I will go the whole hog.Parking is a bit of a problem as the parallel parking spots in that block are rarely available,but you can park on Racecourse Road behind the temple (opposite MTR) and then walk through to Serangoon Road. Remember they are closed on Mondays
5
A really nice surprise. Staff was ready to help the newbies of indian veg food that we were. Food is tasty. Price is very low for singapore. Good alternative to food court (and not much more expensive).
5
Excellent food at a great price. Seriously recommend going here its worth the effort. Our waiter helped us choose our meals and explained the restaurant specialities, and recipe origins. Cannot wait to go back!
5
I am from south India & was happy to see this decades old authentic South India restaurant being opened in Singapore, been there many times especially to have those great Keasri and Gulab Jamoons , love them . i suggest all to try their variety of dishes after which you will feel like cooked at home dishes
4
I love South Indian food (I'm Indian) and udupi food (dosas, vadas and idlis) are my favorite breakfast. MTR has the best South Indian vegetarian food anywhere. I've been to the original MTR in Bangalore a few times and anyone who has been there knows it's an icon.The place in Singapore is smaller and by Singapore standards is quite simple and down to earth. I go to MTR at least 2-3 times a month for breakfast (so that's a lot of times since they opened). The food and service here is excellent and the quality is very consistent and simply cannot be compared with the other South Indian places like Saravana bhavan, ananda bhavan or komalas. My favorite breakfast is a vada and dosa followed by strong coffee. The kids love the idlis and kesari Bhath. All are must try's. The puris are quite good too and they do have several other items on the menu I have not tried. Frankly I didn't want to post about MTR because I wanted it to be my little secret, otherwise I would have to wait for an hour to be seated like in Bangalore.If you like South Indian food,this is a must try. The only place that has better South Indian food is MTR in Bangalore. (Incidentally, I am non vegetarian, and I have been around the world, so this is a global comparison). The only thing I will say for MTR to be better is if they increase their variety and open earlier.
5
Went with two friends and ordered about six dishes so we could try different things. All were excellent - very fresh ingredients, remarkable flavor, and everything served quickly. Hard to pick a favorite, but definitely try the masala dosa and get the chandrahara for dessert. A perfect place for vegetarians (although meat-eaters won't miss anything here). Service was attentive and friendly. I can't wait to go again
4
First visit when visiting family living/working in SGP. Manager/owner was very helpful in recommending some good dishes to try - very different to UK style Indian - but obviously very authentic and tasty too! Service was quick and friendly. Would definitely recommend the Chandaharra dessert :-)
5
We went for lunch. Class A for cleanliness and it has a nice, bustling ambience. You can tell that the food is made from the freshest ingredients. The set meal offers a good selection of different types of curries/sauces. Good portions and great value for money. The masala tea was a little too milky (not the best I've had) but I would go back again for the set meal
5
We've been coming to MTR in singapore almost every alternate Sunday :) and we always leave feeling so satisfied. Their food is the best and it reminds us of Bangalore weekends. Service is also really good - their manager always checks if everything is okay and if we need anything. Highly recommended.
5
A must try in Singapore!!We know the original taste of MTR from India .. And after our many visits to the Singapore branch since it opened we can easily vouch that the same amazing taste, simplicity and love with which it's made in the original Bangalore restaurant has been replicated here in Singapore. The worlds best ghee dosas and rava idlis by far in my opinion.. don't forget to look out for the daily specials!
5
Quality Indian food MTR at Singapore stands tall. I have eaten at a number of places across Singapore and MTR beats them all. Thanks to their quick service too and clean environment. Reading the 60 year history of MTR on the wall was also quite revealing
4
MTR Restaurant served excellent, tasty vegetarian Indian food and the service was attentive. A simple restaurant with its history on its walls. Very enjoyable.
5
... I didn't miss it here at all. Make sure to get the Mango Lassi and the dish that lets you choose from a wide selection of authentic Indian foods, you won't regret it :)
4
The food served here is authentic south Indian vegetarian food. Service is extremely good. Opposite to Vaikunta Nathan perumal temple near career park MRT.
5
First time in mtr. order masala dosa and bisdele bath.
The bath taste good and the masala taste awesome.
Will come again for sure
5
The food and service is really wonderful. Real taste of south indian dishes. Specially rava idly and bisibela bath. Strongly recommend you to taste the food.
4
Lovely place, we had lunch here and like it so much. Highly recommended. We will be back soon . Thank you very much.!!!!!!!
5
Superb food and always maintaining the standard. Very heavy food! Great coffee and dosa. Must visit for South Indian. Good staff.. Very courteous.
5
South-Indian food in it's best avatar; that is MTR restaurant for you! The restaurant is already very well-known in Bangalore for mouth-watering masala dosas, rava idlies, poori-saagu etc. and for lesser known dishes like akki-roti, ragi-dosa etc. When MTR restaurant opened in Singapore, it was the best news for my husband and I. After suffering through many half-cooked dosas, overly spicy sambars and runny chutneys in other south-indian restaurants in Little India, MTR was a wish come true! The food, the service and the cleanliness of the place are impressive. In spite of the number of people visiting the place, especially on weekends, the place is always spotlessly clean, the dishes are piping hot and the staff are always friendly. Its a must visit place for anyone who can't get enough of south-indian delicacies. Bisibele bath, masala dosa, and chow-chow bath, akki rotis and chandrahaara are must-try dishes
5
Went there because of the great reviews and weren't disappointed! We had no clue what to order so we got the recommendations from the manager. It was awesome! We had plenty of Indian food on our trip so far but this was the best and way different to what we had tried. Great new experience! Yummy!
4
After a long time, I decided to go to my favorite restaurant in Singapore. I was confused which one to order as I liked almost all the items. So, this time I ordered the MTR special meal (SGD 12). It was a two course meal. Initially it was a starter with small dosai & bisibelabath and then followed by a complete meal. I must say I was impressed with the taste and the quality of the food. I will be going again next week to taste it again :
5
MTR SIngapore is able to retain MTR Bangalore taste. For Non Bangaloreans,, MTR is best south Indian fast food in Bangalore.
5
Had a superb trip in Singapore, all because of Yummy, healthy, delicious meal at MTR Singapore, superb service, superior quality, 100% same taste as MTR, Bangalore. I am back to Bang and still miss visiting MTR, all Meals used to be undoubtedly in MTR
5
I liked their Neer Dosa & Rava idli very much. Coconut chutney was good too. After the meals, Masala Tea made it complete
5
I found out about MTR Restaurant through Trip Advisor but was sceptical that it was the "best" vegetarian food in Singapore. I'm a vegetarian myself but had been left wanting after two weeks in Vietnam. As a Briton, Indian food provides a strange comfort. MTR Restaurant delivered on all fronts.Upon entering the restaurant, it was obvious this place was popular with locals with Indian ancestry - always a good sign of quality! The cash-register attendant noticed that we (myself and a friend) were perhaps a little out of our depth and had a staff member help us through the menu and make some recommendations, which we were more than happy to go along with.I can safely say that this meal ranks amongst the best vegetarian meals I've ever tasted. I was full (a real feat if you knew anything about my appetite) after having tried a number of foods that I'd never heard of, let alone tried.And the prices were incredibly reasonable for the quantity and quality of food served! Only S$24 to stuff two guests to the brim!The only complaint: the tea took a while to arrive (long after the food had arrived). Given the excellent service with respect to food choice, this is easily something to be forgiven
5
Been there while on transit in Singapore. The food is delicious the service is excellent I was eating 5 minutes after ordering and is also quite cheap. Excellent value for money. Highly recommen
3
they ran out of options from the menu at 8.30pm...so we were not able to eat a particular type of dosa..appam/iyyiappam..do not know the correct name...had to wait for about 20 minutes before we were being served...though the food was decent..especially if you are a vegetarian in singapore .
5
One of our favorite resaturants in Singapore. The place is bright & very well lit up & ambience is refreshing. We usually have akki rotti, bisibelebath, rava idli or dosas. The taste is authentic like the original MTR at Bangalore. The staff is courteous & friendly. Keep it up
5
Every corner in Little India has a South Indian restaurant but if you are looking for fresh, delicious South Indian food, head to MTR. Not only will the dosas soothe your soul, but you will also be able to read this 90 year old restaurant's fascinating history on huge posters on the walls. Old photographs of the original MTR in Bangalore add to the charm of this simple, unassuming restaurant.The dosas (crepes), idlis (rice flour dumplings) and vadas ( doughnut like fritters) excellent. So is the pongal and the bisibele bhat (both rice preparations). I tried the white uppit ( savory semolina) for the first time, which looks like upma but has a rather distinct flavor. The sambar and the chutneys are delicious. The buttermilk was mild and soothing.They also serve special items like neer dosa and akki roti that are not commonly available in other restaurants.I was not very impressed with the special meal thali, not because it lacked in number of items or freshness, but few of the items match the standards MTR sets with their dosas and snacks. The the rasam and daal were too dilute, Even the fried beetroot ,the chhole and the dessert left much to be desired. BUT please don't let my disappointment with the thali detract you from visiting this restaurant. I, for one, will definitely visit again but I would just stick with the individual dishes rather than the thali.Even though MTR is inevitably crowded, ordering is systematic and we didn't have to wait too long for a table. Service is quick and waiters are very responsive. MTR maintains high standards of hygiene. Prices are very reasonable. We ordered 2 individual dishes, 1special meal, 1 buttermilk and 2 filter coffees and paid about SGD 30.I would strongly recommend MTR for South Indian vegetarian cuisine. Along with great food, you can also experience a slice of culinary history of Bangalore.

I visited the restaurant on a Tuesday afternoon and had a most enjoyable time learning about the history and cuisine of this restaurant. Manager Rao was knowledgeable and recommended 3 specialities, the Malasa Dosa, Rava Idly and Bisbele Bhath. First the food...Rava Idly is a steamed semolina cake made from a mix of yoghurt, mustard seeds,cashew nuts, coriander and curry leaves. It tasted elegant with hints of the spices and herbs coming through the almost cake-like sponge. The warm potato sagu and chutney were tasty accompaniments. Apparently, this was provided in place of rice when the latter was scarce during the emergency in India decades ago. I was served the Bisibele Bhath next, This had the texture of well-cooked risotto flavoured with mild spices and bits of carrot and long bean. Accompanied by Raitha...a yoghurt based accompaniment with finely chopped onions. Finally, I was presented with the Masala Dosa whose batter was nicely flavoured with black lentils and a fragrant spiced potato filling. The amount of food could have easily fed two adults and totalled only $15...quite a steal considering the quality of cooking and ingredients. One tip, go early for lunch at about 12 noon and you will be assured of seating. The place rapidly filled up once past 12 30pm. This restaurant provides a nice change to fiery and spicy curries I'm used to as the tastes here are more subtle and gentle on the palate. I look forward to returning with South Indian friends who can truly appreciate and critique the overall experience
5
When we arrived, I thought I might be at the wrong place because it seemed odd that the #6 ranked restaurant (at the time at least) on TripAdvisor in all of Singapore would require diners to order at the door like a McDonald's. We checked again and realized that we were in the right place.We asked the greeter at the counter if we could take a menu and sit down to review it for a few minutes and he readily agreed. We perused the menu and drank some water served to us in a stainless steel pitcher. A few minutes later, a guy who seemed like one of the proprietors came to our table and asked if we had any questions. We asked for recommendation and he order the Masala Dosa and Akki Roti for us (we didn't need to go tot he front of the restaurant to do this) while we ordered Badam Milk and Mango Lassi to drink. Our order came quickly and was quite hot, served with three different sauces that were all just outstanding--we finished each with our spoons. As I said in the title, the food was simple, extremely fresh and well-prepared, not overspiced and tasted just right.Our "waiter" came by a little later and asked if we wanted to order anything else and again we went with his recommendations: Nisibele Bhath served with Raitha (yogurt type sauce) and Alu Bonda with coconut and mint chutney. The first of these was the highlight of the meal for me, especially when eaten with the yogurt sauce--nicely spiced lentils and rice in an excellent sauce.We arrived there at 6:30 on a Saturday evening and were surprised to be able to be seated so quickly. The restaurant quickly filled after our arrival, though, and we were the only non-South Asians/Indians in the restaurant (by my informal, inexpert visual survey). It just looked like locals all dining at their favorite place. The restaurant was extremely clean (4-star toilet!!! ;-)) and clearly well kept. For a restaurant that is 90 years old, clearly regularly updated, this one does not show its age--except in its maintenance of quality. When I want to go Veg Indian in Singapore, I can't imagine going anywhere else
4
Going to MTR is like going back in time :) While the Singapore branch is more modern than its original presence in Bangalore, the fond memories from what used to be home once comes back quite quickly. Friendly staff and helpful patron is always a great add-on to the consistent quality of the traditional menu! Loved it (yet again) and will be back oftenâ€
4
Had akki rotti on Tuesday 12-Aug evening, after a long time. They were superb. Good to see authentic Karnataka food in Singapore. Great taste and very good staff. Keep it up. Tumba chennagide
4
Had lunch with friends great food especially the dosas so why not 5 star service not to the mark like food I believe soon it will get better.All the best to your business
5
I am proud to be a Kannadiga to write a review for the typical Karnataka Hotel which is located in middle of many other South Indian Restaurants at Singapore. Ambiance is awesome. The aroma of freshly cooked eatables + filter coffee. Neatly maintained. It all starts with a nice smile from the staff, who lend their ears patiently and provide the good food. The history of MTR on the walls, provides a feel on how they have evolved and became masters in Karnataka. Rava Idli is the billion dollar bet. If you are a Chutney lover, better do not leave anything within the cup. The place reminds my home. Home food... Namma thindi, Namma Jan
5
Authentic south indian food. Not just dosas and idlis but, much more. Yumm!!! Food and beverages, Super quick service, Nice and clean ambience, Reasonably priced. Would definitely visit again. Highly recommended
5
You can find a lot of Tamil restaurants in Singapore, but MTR is the only authentic Bangalore based restaurant. Serves great food from Karnataka. Very helpful staff, reasonably priced, clean environment.Always visit MTR every time I am in Singapore. Reminds me of Bangalore :-
5
Visited for supper and was received by the counter staff. Nice selection of south indian dishes with karnataka touch. Absolutely fabulous food!
5
We visited this place on 23 July 2014. Ordered 1 Poori plate, Bisibele Bhath, Masala Dosa, Curd (for our son) and total bill came to $17. Food is delicious and staff is friendly. They are happy to help you if you have any question regarding the dishes. Menu is limited which is good as they have not entered into race to serve large number of dishes while compromising on quality.The best thing about this restaurant is their focus on cleanliness in the restaurant and the kitchen
5
It was a wonderful treat for me. The staff are attentive and proactive in introducing the dishes to us and which sauce should go with which dish. Dishes were served in a timely manner and all so yummy
4
Oh this place is best value for your money. Service is excellent for that money. You know not 5 Star but for the bill you pay it is above average. Try the darker Bangalore masala dosa which you can't find in other places. All chutneys are yumm you can just eat them alone! Some of the specials are not available everyday but must try anything on menu that day. Avoid peak hours it could get pretty crowded. The kitchen looks hygienic and well cleaned
4
It's probably the best south Indian quick snacks you'll ever have in Singapore. It's best to go for breakfast for Idli/Dosa/Upma etc (till ~11AM). MTR (Mavalli Tiffin Rooms) has a cult following in Bangalore, India and even lay the claim for the invention of the 'Rava Idli'
5
This is a great place to eat to experience southern Indian food. Its A vegetarian restaurant with great food and coffee. We ate the Masala Dosa, Onion Utappam, Poori Saagu, Ravi Idly and Rice Pongal. We shared between three and were full. We followed up with a cup of coffee each and quoting my dad "the best coffee I've had in Singapore". Great value at $30 for the lot. The staff are very good and were happy to stop and describe the dishes as well as help us choose some. They were very attentive and made sure we were enjoying all the dishes. I Will definitely be taking all our visitors there for a meal
5
We found this on Tripadvisor and rushed off to be completely impressed by this find at the northern end of Serangoon Rd. We parked at City Square Mall and walked the 100 metres up the road. When We arrived the place was full and we were greeted by the cashier who gave us a quick highlights of the menu and helped us place our order within minutes of having walked in the door. After a short wait we were seated and our food arrived quickly after. The food is not presented on anything particularly flash plates, and the decor wasn't overly noticeable, but the food was great, flavoursome and portions were good. Really not important in light of the quality of the food.We had the recommended thosai, idili, and rice. All great and filled us both with the single serve of these three orders. Cost us $25 for the three meals and 2 mango lassies. Recommended, and just as good as anything twice the price. Polite service and smiles
5
If you've eaten at MTR in India, you'll know the experience is amazing but getting to eat the yummm food of MTR in Singapore just doubles the flavor. If you're there on the weekend do try their Special Thali, it gives you a little of everything
5
For all you Dosa lovers, this is indeed the best place in Singapore. MTR is world famous for its delicious Kannada dishes and quality of food and this Singapore strives at its best to keep up the same standard. Some of the ingredients are flown down from Bangalore to maintain the authenticity. All the dosas varieties is very good, neer dosa is also to be found here. Also everyday has a different rice variety to be tasted. In terms of desserts and sweets, do try the Chandrahaara which is modeled after French desserts. Overall surely a must try for Karnataka dishes
5
Best Vegetarian restaurant in Singapore.. I have tasted in many restaurants but never felt like at home... But MTR made me feel like home both in Quality and hospitality... Must visit place for all the foodies... U can't stop ur appetite with one dish.. Last but not the least, Best value for money in Singapore and it will never make u feel regret... :
5
Love MTR. Being a Bangalorean, I am very happy that we have MTR here in Spore. Superb bisi bele bath, plan dosa, rava idly and Chandrahara sweet. Every time we come here we don't miss eating Chandrahara. Overall a brilliant place to get good Karnataka delicacies. I recommend this place for all, ESP vegetarians.
5
We had a wonderful South Indian meal at this restaurant. The service was extremely kind, friendly and helpful. Food came quickly and tasted delicious. It was a great take on South Indian food - they do some of their own 'health-concious' versions of classic South Indian cuisine, including using red and brown rice flour for the dosas. Best dosa I have had anywhere in the world. Would definitely go back
5
Having known how to cook authentic Indian food for many years I found MTR food as true authentic, extremely tasty and well cooked. Service quality was also one of the highest. Variety of South food fishes that MTR offers is also quite rare. There are many other South Indian restaurants in Singapore but its difficult to beat MTR. Moreover, their food is not heavy in oils and spices which makes it easy for anyone to eat it. Food is also very cheap with a very high quality which makes it even more valuable. Tourists must visit at least once and try great food
5
Visiting the restaurant with my daughter who is vegetarian. The manager was very nice and explained the different dishes. Got excellent food and service! Highly recommended
4
Great quality, price and service. Been here twice. First time was year back. Recently, I had take away of masala dosa, idly, upma. Simply the best Masala dosa I had and chutney of rawa idly damn good !!!. Having grown up on different tastes and texture of south Indian food as made in west of India, so my tastes of dishes like dosa, upma, idly are tuned mostly to those of south Indian restaurants in west of India and they are among the best esp in Mumbai, Pune. Had various opportunities to travel pan India and taste regional food. The Masala Dosa at MTR, Singapore is UP there. Among the best I had. I 'd like to bring my brother when in town ( a connoisseur of Dosa and Utappa) and hear from him on this. Keep up the quality. Also like the orderly way the person at cashier takes the order and provides sitting. Ambiance good, wish it be larger. Nice Staff. Thank you. Recommend to all
5
A great place for a quick lunch or a bite to et with friend. Service with a smile, very efficient, extremely clean and yummy food
5
Vegetarian food is unbeatable, just don't expect a french style restaurant with cosy lighting... Instead a clear and clean indian family style restaurant with beautiful energ
5
Got no words to describe this place ! Clean Price - affordable South Indian thali less than 10 sgdOther dishes range between 4-7 sgdBisibelebath, masala dosa best available . Very easily one of the best south indian restaurantsA delight for veg! My only complain is some times their service isn't upto the mark . I guess this could be because they are always so full. Overall a great place !

Food : 10/10Quality : 10/10Service: 9/10Location: 9/10Taste: 10/10 ( Compared with Main Mavalli Kitchen, Bangalore)Please continue to remain Quality Conscious
5
The famous tiffin place from Bangalore, MTR is now in Singapore. They managed to bring in the same quality to Singapore and the food is awesome. Its different from the Tamil style of veg, but it has its own flavors and taste originating in Kannada cuisine. Worth a trip ! Discover the secret food that powered the IT revolution in India and the world
5
We had dinner here based on Trip Advisor reviews. We ordered the Rava Idly, Uddina Vada, Bisibele Bhath, Masala Dosa and a Mango Lassi. All great, but we really enjoyed the Dosa! Great service. Our bill came out to $22 for all of the above mentioned items. The restaurant is very clean and has some nice photos with English writing about the families background on them. Overall, we really enjoyed the experience
5
We went there for a lunch on a Sunday. We had to wait for 15 minutes and reception was courteous as he helped us order our food in advance.We ate bisibela bhath, special thali, rava idli, kesari bhath as well. We felt while special thali is good, ordering a la carte was a better choice.Food quantity is OK, taste is simply great with top quality spices and nice smell ghee. It's a bit small place and gets crowded easily but we went there for food only.Strongly recommended if you love South Indian food
5
Great authentic South Indian fare.Even better than the one in Bangalore.Excellent personal service .Don't miss it if you like South Indian foodi
5
There are lots of indian vegetarian restaurants in Singapore. Recently I had occasion to have lunch at MTR, Singapore. I tried the Karnataka favorite Bisi Bela Bath. It was very authentic and the taste was very similar to what I used to have in Mysore. The ambience and service were also very good. I plan to visit every week to have my favorite Bisi Bela Bat
4
MTR specialized to serve southern Indian dishes. We went for dinner and all the 4 dishes we ordered are fantastic!!!The Mango Lassi is very nice too~~~ They only serve set meal for lunch... my family wanna try them sometimes soon!!! The staff over there are friendly and helpful... help us take photos and asking about our comments on their dishes~~ it was a really enjoyable dinner!If you are looking for delicious Indian food you definitely have to visit MTR

The finest place to have delicious south indian food in singapore !!!!!!pricey >>>> Yes , but its worth it.Good ambience, food tastes the finest , service good !!!!

Being a true-blue Bangalorean - MTR is something akin to a slice of Life ...Tasty with some surprises thrown in, and where 'quality-taste' comes in small packages! I first discovered MTR a couple of months ago and have since then made it my weekly haunt post my Music class. Strategically located a few metres away from City Square Mall and the MRT Exit, MTR Restaurant in Singapore is a small restaurant with a simple menu that pays homage to its Bangalore branches. Having sampled their Rava Dosa, Masala Dosa, Rava Idly, Akki roti and the good ol' Filter coffee - I highly recommend their Masala Dosas and Akki Roti (Tuesday special) to first-timers. This taste is truly special and incomparable to other Dosas available in the Little India/Farrer Park region. For this, one must be prepared to pay a dollar more and wait a few minutes longer for the food is freshly prepared minus that stale taste of stored food. The Filter coffee is a tad better than other South Indian restaurants, but still cannot be compared to what is available in Bangalore. Rather, the Baadami haalu (Almond milk) is one of their rarer specialities. Remarkably clean and with good service that is constantly improving in both speed and efficiency - I recommend MTR to be a must-visit for South Indian Veg food. Had it been a cheaper dosa, I would make it my staple food, but in hindsight I have realised that the very tasty and freshly-prepared dosa is 6 dollars well-spent once a week, one doesn't get tired of the taste like other places - and if you are a Vegetarian in Singapore like me , I have realised that I am willing to pay a premium for freshly-prepared food any day
5
I never wanted to go to this restaurant because I had heard from my friends that this place was very pricy ! My husband is a big fan of this restaurant but I never accompany him to this place ..My in-laws had come to visit us and my hubby insisted we go for dinner here .After I had the food here - All I could say was "It the definitely worth the money ' And to add to it the manager\cashier and the waiters were so nice and humble - Their service definitely won my heart !! Thank you so much !! With lots of good wishes Ranjan and Deep

good indian food @ singapore little india, the taste was very good especially idli voda and dosa was very goo
4
MTR since my last visit very soon after they opened, has definitely made changes, employed a strong service staff and smoothed out all operational kinks. For those from India but not from South FYI all dosas are not alike nor are all sambars! So while MTR serves "South Indian" food, it is Bangalore style and a dosa from MTR tastes very different from one next door at Lukshmi Narasimhan or down the road from Komalas. The quality, hygiene and standards maintained at MTR are impeccable and I on and off crave that style of food and drop by for it. However only occasionally as the items are priced much higher than other restaurants that sell similar style food and an MTR dosa costs twice as much as a Komalas dosa! To top it off, in the city that taught me "tapau" in the first week of being here, MTR charges 10% for packing food to take away. When asked I was told it was because they used proper boxes and not plastic bags! I find this charge exorbitant and will not do take away from here again.I will continue to have the occasional meal to enjoy the taste of their wonderful food
5
Best veggie food with the taste of home food away from home.. I would love to visit this place every day !!! :-

Unfortunately even though there are a lot of south Indian restaurants in Singapore, the taste doesn't come close to what we get in India. But MTR from my home city has brought the same taste to my adopted country. Everything from chow chow bath to masala dosai to poori is brilliant...yeah!!
5
We absolutely love this restaurant...consistent service and authentic taste -- must try - rava idli, plain dosa n curd rice

The staff are the best, they give an excellent service EVERY time, that is never seen anywhere before in Singapore :)This is my 4th visit in two months..I love this place - best indian a Veg. food experience in town

At the onset, I'll be honest: 1/ I didn't even know that MTR existed in Singapore until last night! 2/ I've never written a review beforeMy friend was leaving for Oxford for further studies in a few days, and he asked if we could meet up one last time before he flew off. And then he dropped the bomb: let's go to MTR.I'd been to MTR Lalbagh (Bangalore) exactly once 5 years ago, and it was a gastronomical delight. Coupled with the fact that I went with a local friend of mine, the experience was amazing. I can vividly remember the waiter mentally noting down orders for 20 people at a go and then appearing with the delicacies after a while.Cut to the present: I was standing in front of MTR, and we walked in and placed the orders. Order: there was no waiter to take the order at the tables: I presume to cut operating costs. That has a huge disadvantage, which you'll realize in a while. So we ordered rava idlis (semolina steamed cakes), masala dosas (rice pancakes with potato filling) and filter coffee, MTR style: all at the billing counter. We were given a placard with a number; which was for the waiter to deliver the food from the kitchen to the tables.To the table: Since there were two of us, we wanted to sit in a small table. The eatery has about 50 seating places, with long 10-seater tables in the centre flanked by 4-seaters at the sides. There was one 4-seater table available, but after a futile wait for a few minutes, we didn't notice anybody cleaning it. We were about to grab a 10-seater, but the Floor Manager told us to wait and in a minute, somebody came and cleaned the tables.Food: the rava idlis arrived almost instantaneously, with the customary small bowl of clear heated ghee at the side, with thick coconut chutney and steaming pallya (potato curry) in small serving bowls. The ghee was dutifully poured on the idli, and I took the first hesitant spoonful. I felt like I'd been yanked back in history to the same MTR in Bangalore: it tasted exactly the same. The fresh coconut chutney was fresh and consistent (not with the usual watery 'discharge' that you get in other eateries) and the pallya was hot and tangy; just perfect!The dosas had arrived, in the meanwhile. Time for the spoon test: which is, picking up the spoon, cutting the dosa at the edge and instantly realizing that the crust was perfect: brown on the outside and just done on the inside. The potato filling was perfect, as was the sweet sambar and the same coconut chutney. The cook has been successful in recreating the magic.Finally, the filter coffee. A bit too milky for my friend's taste, but I didn't find it too bad.Now, the faux pas. We wanted another cup of coffee, so we asked the waiter if he could get us another cup of coffee each. He nodded and ten minutes passed, the coffee didn't arrive. I got up and paid for two coffees at the counter, and the coffee arrived in 5 mins. There should be a provision for guests to be able to append items to the order later. Imagine if one were to eat with his hand: s/he would have to get up, wash hands, grab the wallet, walk over to the counter, pay for the items. It complicates even further if the guest is alone: the waiter might clear the half-finished food, because there was nobody at the table.All in all, it was a great experience. The floor manager was nice, amicable and requested me to write a review, and here it is. The price is very reasonable, considering the location of the restaurant and the fact that the quality of the food is very good. The hearsay is that it's the first MTR eatery out of India, but I don't have anything to prove it. The menu and the price of the food can be found at its online site: http://www.mavallitiffinrooms.com/singapore/. This is a bonus, because you know what's on offer and the budget.All in all, we spent SGD 28 for two masala dosa, two rava idlis and 4 filter coffees. Pretty much the same price at all the other eateries nearby (foreign outlets of established Indian eateries), but the taste was perfectly recreated. The floor manager runs a tight ship, kudos to him

Do not go by the brand. There are far better South Indian restaurants in Singapore (Raj, Anand Bhavan). Also, there are limited items on the menu and prices are on the higher side
4
Food is superbly delicious. The place and kitchen is very clean. On weekends one has to wait for tables. They need to expand to a bigger place. This standard of food needs very nice ambience
4
I searched various places in singapore to hav south Indian food and one fine day i found this and had my breakfast and lunch.. Really tasty and my family enjoyed a lot, cost is also average
4
Jet-lagged and wanting something close to my hotel in Lavender, I stumbled upon the reviews on this place: MTR.In New Zealand, the supermarkets are stacked with these beautiful little $2 packet-curries made by a company called MTR - so what was this? A chance to eat at an actual MTR outlet? Their Singapore HQ?!Unlikely, but it made me Barry Chuckle, nonetheless.Arriving at The MTR Head Office, I was greeted in a friendly manner and shown to a table. While friendly, the staff were slightly fussy, with a rushed feel to their demeanour. I also felt that they were trying to determine my order for me - I'll decide myself, thanks.When delivered, the food was of a great standard, and for a very good price, too.I would pop by here again for a quick feast - about $25 for a couple of meals and a desert
5
The dosas both masala & rawa were excellent, the best part is that the accompanying sambar for each dish be it the dosas or the vada or rawa idli was distinct! And each of them were pretty good particularly the accompaniment to rava dosa which was similar to avial, the good old sambar was pretty good as well.The vada was excellent, the rawa idli & filter coffee were good.Overall a very good addition to Singapore's Indian Food scen
5
Absolutely yummy and authentic MTR food. Being from Bangalore, I have missed the dosas from there until now.We love their service, which is warm and also quick. We return week after week and cant fault it
5
The gentleman at the front counter is very friendly and all chefs wear face masks when preparing food. They are meticulous and the presentation of the food is worthy of a 5 star rating. Keep up the great work. We notice your diligence
5
Those who are from Bangalore will probably know the famous MTR restaurants there. This one is perfectly similar in terms of taste and quality. The dosa's and idli/vada's are probably the best you will find in Singapore. Highly recommend this place
5
Food was excellent - high quality, freshly made and quickly served. We went as a group of 8. They quickly arranged tables close by even though the restaurant was busy and crowded and served food in a very short time. Our group had 4 children and the waiters were very patient with the noisy kids. All in - it was a great experience!
5
Amazing South Indian food, always freshly prepared and great taste. True value for money.... food tastes the same as MTR chain of restaurants in Bangalore. Friendly staff and good service attitude
5
Love the food, quick and efficient service. Possibly the best South Indian tiffin I've had outside of my grandmother's place. Would happily return daily if I could. Yum!
4
Had tried this only once which is a better experience. Clean ambience and good food are provided at a nominal price. Pay before eat system feels a bit awkward because if you want to have some more food again then it's a bit irritating...
5
Go there for south indian food like dosa', idli's vada.They serve best possible dosa in town.try their afternoon buffet
4
Cheap, simple, tasty food sans the frills- friendly gentleman manning the front desk; highly recommended
3
I seriously don't know how this restaurant has made to No 8 spot. Madras Woodlands on Upper Dickson Road can beat it on any criteria.I hate places where one has to first pay and then is served (like a takeaway place with seats). The owner was owner/manager was quite rude when I approached him a and complained about the food.I am a foodie and can eat and enjoy virtually any kind of food..... But this place wasn't quite my type. The restaurant called 'Lakshmi Narasimhan' which stood there before this MTR opened was fan. Food there was superb and service excellent. But MTR isn't really living up to the reputation. So if you wang a good south Indian meal there are much better places including Komalas, Anand Bhawan,Madras Woodlands etc.....don't waste your time here
5
We came here due to the reviews on trip advisor and it lived up to its expectations and more! The staff were really helpful, they organised for a selection of food for us to share, explained all the dishes and which order to eat them in. All the food was delicious and really authentic tasting, we didn't even miss meat! Very clean restaurant and very good value for money : )
4
A much needed change for the South Indian palette. Crispy dosa, vadas and yummy bisibele bath...love the place
4
We had very good service and a lovely lunch here. Highly recommend the Marsala. We had fun trying a range of different dishes and our waiter was helpful ensuring they could be shared easily. The set menu looked great value for money too
5
Recently visited MTR restaurant at Kitchener road in Singapore, food served felt like authentic home cooked and the service was excellent, with absolutely no waiting time. Thanks to hardworking servers made us feel at home, despite their manager asking them not to talk to customers.If you are visiting Singapore make sure to visit this restaurant. It's worth it!
5
This place is awesome for south indian vegetarian food.Their rava idly is very good, so is their puliyogre.
4
MTR is a south-indian restaurant with roots from 1924. It is the best south indian I've had in Singapore so far and lives up to its expectation of being 'authentic'.I've tried their masala dosai, rice idlies, bisebile bhat, khara bhat and mango lassi and I give a thumbs up to everything!Next time I'm in Little India, I know where to go for south-indian food! :-
5
Must visit restaurant. Enjoyed the business below Bhatt and he khava Bhatt. Topped off with stimulating coffee. And this, coming from a Kannadiga. :)
5
Must visit if you like vegetarian Karnataka cuisine. Excellent value for money. Personalized service. Great taste. The one thing I missed from home (Bangalore
4
Enjoyed my dosas here with my friend.Dosa were good no complain but was little expensive.Would recommend if you don't mind paying little more.Thank you for the good standard dosas
4
I went there for a birthday celebration and we didn't book a table beforehand. The place seems quite popularly as it was already crowded when we arrived (Saturday lunch time). Nevertheless the service was really helpful and they managed to pull together tables and add on extra chairs for our group of eight people. And despite the fact that it was packed the food arrived very quickly and it was really pleasant! The only thing I wouldn't recommend it for is probably a romantic date ;
5
Went to this restaurant three times in one week. Great food, and it is the only place I found in Little India that was clean (and really clean, not fake clean, at that). Highly recommended.
5
Masala dosa is unique and massive. Great service and the staff is very courteous. Highlights of the place - MUST TRYBisi belle bathKhara bathRava idlyRagi dosaOnion Rava dosa Poori SaaguAkki rot

I like MTR because all the food items are very tasty and delicious , I like it so much that I always force my parents to take me to MTR. I wish I can visit MTR everyday --From Asha P2 Student in Singapor

Let me explain my title...When I arrived here last night, around 8pm, there was a small queue of people. The restaurant itself is rather small & it was almost full. I stood in line and ordered my food & drink at the counter, as instructed. The owner ushered me to a table where another women was sitting (& insisted that I sit there) he then moved me again as the said women had friends joining her. After 10 minutes, I had to ask for my drink- which was bought straight away. After a further 5 mins the food arrived.The food was excellent.... very diverse & distinctive taste of good quality flavours. As soon as one plate was cleared the waiter took it... then the owner sat a man at the table with me. Luckily he was a local who gave me lots of tips! Then, no sooner had I took my last bite, the waiter took the plate! Now, I'm not sure if this is cultural way of dining, or perhaps it was because they were busy- but I feel it ruined the meal a little. As title says- wish I had more time to enjoy it
3
Excellent food. No doubt on that. But cost wise, it is on higher side. So once a while it is OK. But there so many other eateries that you can explore and serve good food.
5
After so many recommendations at tripadvisor I've tried it for myself and i have to say, it was very good. I've ordered several dishes (with the help of the cashier) and every dish was fantastic, even for a non-vegetarian.
5
one of the things we always liked in singapore was lack of karnataka style authentic food. with MTR opening, we are hooked onto this place for good. Excellent food, looks so fresh, clean and tasty, that we end up going there every single time. Not to mention the friendly owner, who has good acumen towards customer service. Way to go MTR:))
4
Finally I get Bangalore food in Singapore! Oh how I have waited for this day! A decent place to have the famous Bangalore style benne masal dose and the sweet sambar! The masala dosa & the bisi bele bhaat are my personal favorites and I will willingly go through pain to gain them. Not that there is much pain in getting this in Singapore now with MTR having opened. But it is inherent in the nature of MTR to be slightly painful to customers. So the good points first: 1. As expected, the food is Bangalore-style. I do not find the quality diminished from its transition from Bangalore to Singapore (some people do). 2. People not familiar with Bangalore cuisine or MTR, please do not go expecting Tamil style dosa, do not expect endless dosa varieties, or tamil-style sambar, We in Bangalore do our sambar sweet and cinnamon scented and that's how we like it. 3. Do not expect too much variety in the menu either. They have a set menu of what they do, and that's all they do. And they do it decently. 4. The service is middling, but then I am not looking for fancy service here.Fair points: 1. It is conveniently located in Farrer Park, opp the Perumal Temple. Easy for people to find and visit when on a trip to that part of the city.2. It's usually not bursting at the seams with people, one almost always gets a table when you walk in. (My experience!)Bad points: (Beg your indulgence on my ranting...)1. The seating/paying system is entirely asinine! So on some days, you can sit down, order and pay when you leave. On some other days, you order and pay first, and then find a place to sit. Now paying up and then finding a place to sit is not an alien concept to Singaporeans, we know how to do that. But that is usually done in food courts. To walk into a restaurant and having to pay before you get your food, is strange. However, if that's the way you want it MTR, then that's fine with us, but you need to mention it and facilitate it.When you enter, there is no sign telling you whether you need to order first, or find a place to sit first. The cashier, who is the first person you see as you walk in, studiously avoids eye-contact with you, to subtly let you know that he is not involved in dealing with you at this point. Next, there is no host or hostess to seat you or brief you. No signs to tell you to take a seat as you please, or wait to be seated, or to order before you take a seat. No one hands you a menu upfront so you know the protocol.Now if I didn't know better, I'd say these people were running a restaurant for the first time (which, being a Bangalorean, I know is not true). And being from Bangalore, I understand where their scatter-brained attitude to seating and ordering come from a two reasons: A. MTR is an old and extremely popular restaurant in Bangalore. They have long lines of people waiting to get in everyday. And they expected the same response here, which clearly would have eliminated any idea of being seated first. So they don't know how to deal with customers who have not stood in line to get inside, but walk right in and finding the place half-empty, sit down and ask for a menu to start ordering. B. They have a fixed menu that most Bangaloreans know. But non-Bangaloreans don't know their menu. And MTR expects you to know it without seeing a menu card. All the cashier will do is tell you whether the item is available, over, or not made today.MTR was so disorganized in the opening weeks, and the fact that most things on the menu are time-bound, and most other things are proudly declared to be "over" (sounds like bad restaurant planning to me rather than any attestation of how much in demand their food is) that the crowds completely leave this place alone. Which is a pity because the Bangalore style masal dose (with benne/white butter), rava idli, chow-chow bhaat, bisi-bele bhaat all are excellent. The coffee is legendary too.2. Another bone I have to pick with MTR is, they displaced the MUCH better and more versatile optioned vegetarian restaurant Sri Lakshmi Naarashimhan

Like many other reviews mentioned here about this restaurant. It's really a must place to visit for south indian food.I went to this restaurant couple of times in March. We found the food taste really good and the hygiene level is awesome.I tried dosa,idly,poori set,vada and finished with filter coffee.Eveything was gd.Yes it is a bit pricey compared to other south indian restaurant but for the quality and cleanliness,no harm paying that amount.A Must place to visit to get the best of south indian food. I will be going again to try the set meals
5
Had a hearty food with family trying 9 different items including Set Dosa. I certainly rate this restaurant high for Hygiene and food authenticity. I have tried Anand Bhavan and Saravana Bhavan near Seragoon area. MTR is in different league. Please keep up MTR team. Spread your service with delivery to homes.
5
I've love the MTR restaurant at Bangalore and have been visiting it for the past 20yrs. The MTR restaurant in Singapore is excellent and authentic. I am not a big fan of the South Indian restaurants in Singapore as they cater to a different kind of palate. If you want the true tastes of Bengaluru do visit MTR and you will not be disappointed. I would urge the management to try and open another outlet preferably in the west. Jurong east would be an ideal location.JB
5
MTR has the best masala dosai I have had in Singapore. The small pot of ghee that accompanies it is the perfect finish to a mouthwatering dosai, accompanied with chutney that complements it. The rice dishes are also very flavoursome. my only grievance is that the serving size is a little small, and one dish isn't enough to satiate, if you're hungry. But that's just as well, you can get to try two of their dishes in one visit
2
If you want to pay your bill before the food is served, this is THE restaurant to visit in Singapore. For me a total rip off, with a smallish masala dosa costing as much as SGD 6.00 and the Upama tasting like anything but Upama!! the quality of food can be best described as 'fair'. I will not ever go here again
5
Mtr is my fav joint in singapore and mecca for Bangaloreans.. its worth every dollar spent ..masala dosa melts inside you..thanks to the pure ghee... so does hot besibele bath..idli and rava idli with ghee makes u feel at home..so does the staff of mtr .. be it ever smiling Rao or humble Mr bhat at the Cash... All in all this places pull you again and again .. Hope to see u in raffles soon
5
Stayed in singapore for one week with family and this was the place we used to have the breakfast, all the dishes in menu are excellent especially bisibelebath, rava idly, uddin vada and masala dosa
5
absolutely lip smacking choice of snacks and sweets. This is the best vegetarian restaurant in singapore
4
MTR is the place for vegetarian food lovers, especially for those who love South Indian food varieties. I have been to this restaurant few times and I feel the taste remains the same every time I eat. There is no doubt that price is quite expensive, but it is worth the money. A single piece of idly will cost you S$ 2 :)My choice of food would be masala dosa, rava idly and filter coffee
4
A simple yet nice clean eating place on Serangoon Road. It serves only vegetarian food which is not only delicious but also light on the pocket. Service is quick and good. For a vegetarian meal it is a must in Singapore. I tried Mint Rice and Masala Dosa with some spicy pickles. It was toothsome
5
A restaurant that I wouldn't normally visit in a location that I wouldn't normally go to and food that I wouldn't normally try. Proving that Indian food is varied, simple and delicious, this is a must-visit for when you are in Singapore. I'll leave the 'foodie review' type comments to the experts, but suffice to say that you cannot go wrong. Price is super-reasonable, quantities are spot on (and if you're hungry.... get another dish), service is what it should be in that you catch the waiter's eye, ask for food and it arrives...(personally I don't want waiters leaning over me every 2 seconds asking me if everything is ok). I left comfortably full with wallet intact and an experience of top-class food that I hadn't tried before. Try it
5
You cannot find better food than MTR in Singapore. From the time I first visited, I am going to MTR twice every week. If only they had multiple outlets in Singapore, I would have been more frequent that twice a week. Vanghi Bath, Curd Vada and Masala Dosa my favourites in MTR. #mustry #best foo
5
Thoroughly impressed with the taste of the food, the quality of the ingredients used and the service extended. If you want to try authentic South Indian food, head to MTR. Highly recommended! And oh, don't forget to get a filter coffee. It beats Starbucks any day!
4
I've been to MTR multiple times and my experience here has always been excellent. The service is quick and efficient, and the food is hot and fresh, which is not all that common in South Indian restaurants in Singapore. The food is really authentic, whether it is the sambhar vada, bisibella bath, or the dosa. It's very similar to the food you get in Bangalore. I'd highly recommend eating here
4
MTR is from my home country, Home state, Home town and finally from same native celestial coastal district of Karnataka. I was excited when I heard MTR outlest is going to come in SIngapore. Rawa idly is awesome. Hygenically prepared foods as per MTR recipes and healthy vegetarian diet. The staffs are very good giving warm happy smile and the resuarant is situated opposite to the Perumal Temple, gives a kind of peace and self satisfaction while every bit of food being chewed. A celestial experience.....I further recommend to MTR Management also encourage diversity, employ female waitress and give personalised attention and explain the dishes to the non-indian visitors. Also another recommendation would be to display the Yakshagana Puppets or Classical photoes of the coastal Yakshagana dance drama which also enhances the interior ambience of the MTR and also promotes a bit of native culture along with native food, after all business has to serve back to soceity. (As the founder is from the native place where celestial Yakshagana art is born) So customers can enjoy the celestial food and see few photoes of Yaksha dances on the vedio screen while deriving senual celestial pleasure to the taste buds and to eyes...........Thanks, very Best, Halady Shashikantha Acharya, Singapor

One of the best places in Singapore to feel the taste of south India! The authenticity of the food and atmosphere delivers right to Bangalore, where the original restaurant is located. Nowhere else you can taste typical Bangalore Masala Dosa made from organic rice by professional chefs under highly demanding conditions! Also, I had an amazing opportunity to get to know the owner of this restaurant. I was fascinated by the process of making the food, the requirements for the staff and even highly secured recipes of their specialities! So you can be sure you won't have the same dishes anywhere else except Bangalore. Traveling from my home Lithuania, I tried a number of restaurants around South-east Asia and Singapore in particular, however I haven't seen such a great staff and the level of cleaness and quality. Hope you will enjoy being there as well as I did
4
This is the cleanest place i have ever seen. It hand down serves the best south indian food in the town. Can try anything and everything but will highly recommend - Bisbelle Bath, Rawa Idli, coffee/
5
Generally vegetarian meals do not gel with my preferred taste but when I visited MTR Singapore, my impression changed.
MTR Singapore serves outstanding vegetarian food.
Kudos to them!!!
Jerome
5
Went there ~8pm after visiting Mustafas nearby. Surprised at how fresh everything was. Masala Dosa was excellent, and thought I'd order the idli after reading about it on the wall. Amazingly good! http://instagram.com/p/lr0OqcNYoO/
5
Clean, hygienic, authentic food, great dosa. Attentive and helpful service. Very good value for money, simply one of the great family restaurants
5
Best south Indian food. Reminds me of the MTR in Bangalore. Service is great. My favorite are rava idli, bonds soup and dosa. Recommended anytime.
5
I have been to this restaurant a few times since it opened a year or more ago and have never been disappointed. Everything that I have tasted in the menu has been of consistently good quality. The dosas, rava idli, bisibele bath, khara bath, bonda and other dishes specific to MTR have all been fresh and very tasty.My doctor friends from the US and UK were equally impressed with the food and we ended up tasting many dishes at the recommendation of the Manager at the counter. Everyone was happy at the end of tasting at least 10 different dishes! And the coffee was fantastic. Two of us had two cups each!Please maintain the good quality of food and service and I am sure MTR Singapore will continue to be the best vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. Fantastic Food! Try it
5
I was always craving for Badam Halwa and Bisibele Bath of Bangalore style. One of my friends adviced me to drop in to MTR. I finally did with my husband. We both enjoyed every dish to the core. We really felt for a while that, we are back to our super delicious taste of Mysore-bangalore. Thank you MTR..You can expect our visit every often..:
5
We had the opportunity to have breakfast at the MTR restaurant at Serangnoon Road in Singapore and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the hospitality. We have had food in other restaurants in Serangoon Road in the last 3 days and found MTR to be the best true to their name and tradition. I will strongly recommend MTR to those who wants to have a tasty food away from India
4
So happy to be introduced to MTR, which is now in Singapore, where I more often visit. A friend clued me in as this was this favorite family resto back in India. Authentic food, made fresh, in a clean family resto environment --- and so affordable! We had the Kesaribhath (yum!) and although the rava idli and dosa was good, my favorite was the poori! Cap it off with South Indian coffee...I will definitely be back
5
I am from Karnataka and have been visiting this restaurant weekly for more than six months now. This is the most authentic Karnataka cuisine I have had in Singapore. They get all the ingredients from India, and have maintained consistency in taste and quality.I strongly recommend this to connoisseurs of Indian food
5
I would like to recommend MTR for their best service and Quality of the food. I am big fan of their Rasam Vada and Coffee which part of my meal even though I visit them daily.
5
Authentic Bangalore (South Indian) Taste you will never get anywhere else in Singapore. Now I don't miss Bangalore food any more
5
There is an authentic taste to every bite that you have here. The food is slightly pricey to make it a regular eating destination, but once a week has become a norm for me.
5
Excellent taste! Though highly priced, the taste makes it worth having a light meal at MTR! Their highlights are rava idli and bisibela bath - I totally recommend them.
4
Taste of food is excellent and mouth watering... But $5 per Dosa makes it most expensive Dosa in Singapore....must try food would be their Rava Idli, Bidibella bath, bonda Soup and Filter Coffee...
4
Being from Bangalore MTR ensures that we do not miss Bangalore food!!!!
The dishes are good. Coffee disappoints as it was not upto the mark.
They need to expand so that there will be less crowd and food will reach our table faster.
5
MTR serves authentic South Indian vegetarian food. Every item served in the restaurant is tasty and I would recomend that you try each one of them every time you visit. The food is light hence, does not cause much concern even if you are not very big fan of Indian food. Also as a foreigner I would recommend this place as the food is not very spicy unlike many other Indian restaurants. The key aspect about the food in MTR is the freshness of the food and despite having visited this places multiple times they have maintained the quality. The owners take personal care to ensure that the guests needs are well looked after. The price for the items served are slightly on the higher side as compared to other Indian restaurants serving similar kind of food however, not too very high.Some of the must try dishes are:- Bisi bele bath- Kara bath- Bagala Bath (Curd Rice)- Poori Sagoo- Onioin Uthapam- Sambar Vada................Do not miss any opportunity that you may have to visit this place
5
I am a South Indian and from Bangalore . I would have to admit MTR Singapore is best in the world. I have visited many South Indian restaurant in the world. This is the best so far. Bisi bele bath is very good. I have been regular there since last 2 days trying everything on the menu, expect to complete by end of next week
5
Had food in this restaurant on 5th of this month with three of my friends. The taste of the food is awesome. Clean restaurant with professional staff and price is little bit expensive but still food comes first. Overall I would love to visit this place for food if I go to Mustafa Center. I have suggested my friends to try in this restaurant as well… we done MTR….you guys are good. God bless you all.
1
While the food might be of good quality the pathetic service on two occassions forces me to write this review. The latest incident took place about 10 days ago when I visited MTR for dinner. When my food (Rava Dosa) did not arrive for more than 15 minutes I checked with the person serving me as to what happened to my order.He said that the kitchen is busy and the food will be served in "2 minutes". The 2 minutes stretched to another 15 minutes. When even after 30 minutes my food was nowhere to be seen I reached break-point. I demanded a refund and left the place deciding never to come back again.No doubt the place is clean and food is good. But for the premium price we pay for the food a certain standard of service is expected. The unapologetic nature of the staff only made matters worse.My suggestion - visit this place only if you have few hours to spare and when you are not terribly hungry
4
MTR is one of my favorite Indian restaurant in Singapore and have been there many times,in fact a regular visitor. Service is excellent, staff very polite and eager to please, rapid service.Food is simply delicious in particular Rava Idli, Bisibele Bhaath.....
5
Good quality, fast service and yummy food.. Worth a visit.. Try the rava idly, puligare and set dosa..
5
Been to quite a few south india restaurants in little india but this one is undoubtedly the best. The food is really fresh, cleanliness and service is top class. Love their Masla Dosa and Rava Dosa.
5
Even though there are other restaurants that provide this menu, the unique
taste provided by MTR pulls me to this restaurant.
i have been there several times and never felt any compromise in taste and quality.
May be pricey but worth it.

Try the Rava idly for sure, an authentic Karnataka based idlies. High level of cleanliness maintained.

I visited Singapore from Beijing and was pleasantly surprised to find a new MTR here. This is the first MTR to open outside India. I am from Bangalore which is the home town of MTR and have lived in many countries. This restaurant is a topper when it comes to authentic South Indian food. Even in Singapore where there are many Indian restaurants it is very easy to pick this as the best. I ate rava idli, bisi bele bath (my childhood favourite), dosa and gulab jamun. The quality of the ingredients is top class as even the chutneys accompanying the dishes could be relished on their own. This requires some serious effort. Kudos to the management team! I am now looking forward to my next trip to Singapore as MTR will surely be the highlight of my trip again

Kudos to MTR for replicating the taste of the food i grew up having in MTR LalBagh , Bangalore .Whenever i want to savor tasty authentic South Indian food ,especially Rawa Idlis , in a clean and nice ambience with excellent service , MTR is the place i go to.Well done and keep up the good work

I had one of their Bhath [Rice] dishes with Brindjal. I found it very bland. Asked for a side dish of chili which is served in most restaurants in Singapore, but the Manager informed me that they do not provide chili side dishes. Alternatively some chutney or curry gravy would have been welcome, but was not offered. I ordered a masala tea which most Indian restaurants in Singapore serve. They said they serve only Teh Tarik the local version of milk tea
5
The best Bangalore-style South Indian breakfast in Little India or indeed Singapore. I've had idlis, masala dosas and their filter coffee. I found it as authentic as their Bangalore branch and very well priced, we paid about $15 for breakfast for 2. Service is quite good - staff is warm and friendly
5
One of the highlights on a trip home to Bangalore used to be breakfast at MTR. We're so delighted that the same food is now available right here in Singapore! Simply the best dosas, bisibele bhath and rava idli (an MTR invention, and continues to set the standard) in the world, accompanied by wonderful sambhar and chutney and washed down with their signature filter coffee. The same impeccable quality, cleanliness and service that is the MTR hallmark. A slice of Heaven in Little India
4
Glad that MTR is opened in SG :) Food is superb which is in accordance to MTR standard. Little pricy but worth it.
5
I've been in Singapore for 7 years , however i've never had such a good Idly, Vada, Bisibelebath anywhere around. I had been to MTR in Bangalore a few years before. I'm so happy that they maintain the quality of food, this included with the pure ghee makes my breakfast /lunch/dinner just too satisfied. The staff is very hospitable. I recommend all those who are craving for south Indian food to visit MTR
4
I have never seen tables being cleaned up so well prior to serving dishes! They use a mixture of soap & water ensuring a crystal clear table. The service was worth mentioning with waiters coming to your table in anticipation. Special mention to the manager, Mr Rao who ensured that all our gastro needs were taken care of promptly! Signature dishes like Bisebela Bath, Plain Dosai & Chow Chow Bath were delicious except that certain other dishes like Puris & Chapathis need to have more side dish varieties. Overall was an experience of service with a smile indeed ... however dishes are definitely priced on the higher side compared to Komala Vilas, Madras Woodlands etc in Singapore
5
Great food and lives up to the MTR name. All the dishes recommended by the staff were fantastic. Service was very quick. Environment is basic but clean. We had an incident where we spilled a cup of coffee accidentally. We were moved to another table and were provided with another cup of coffee and the staff refused to let us pay for the replacement coffee. I will be certainly rank this as my favorite places for South Indian vegetarian food
5
I have been having food regularly at MTR since they first opened in Singapore . Their food is excellent quality and value for money . Its a unique menu must try their masala dosa , akhi roti ,sevigai bath, rava idli and the afternoon lunch . Recommended must try at least once then you will visit again and again
4
We eat out pretty often and are at a loss for home cooked food. This restaurant serves that purposes. Suitable for working individuals who often eat out, they have specials everyday- so it's not the same fare. The service is clean, stands out amidst other Indian restaurants. The food is simple, yummy and not so spicy. The coffee is starbucks quality at a fraction of the price! Not suitable if you want ambience but a must if you want a tasty homestyle meal
5
MTR has preserved its original taste and simple settings. At first I thought they were a way bit highly priced than similar restaurants in Singapore. But over weeks and months (You may by now know that I frequent there often), I have realized the quality and consistency is their key feature. Off late am visiting MTR with friends from different cultures and the feedback I get is very consistent and good.This is one of the best places for well cooked meals. Their Thali comes with a lot of freshly and rightly cooked vegetables, retaining the taste and color of the veggies. undoubtedly the Masala Dosa and Coffee have a signature of their own. AKKI ROTI (Rice Roti) is fabulous, even the thought is mouthwatering now, however its selectively available on Tuesdays (Or wed) only.I would look forward for MTR to introduce some more authentic Karnataka dishes into their portfolio. For now, keep the good work and look forward to more delicious times
5
Unfortunately I visited 8 months too late....why???.....because I heard that this is not the original Bangalore MTR....I learnt my mistake of believing in hearsay...The Food is absolutely awesome & ambiance as humble as possible. Missing South Indian Food....If u cant go to Bangalore MTR....Then must visi
5
It was my first time i tried indian cuisine. And i was amazed! I loved the dishes that they advised me. Everything was delicious! I had two their signature dishes and i was already fool after first one. The portions were too big as for me. Good food! Nice people! Friendly atmosphere!
5
I was introduced to this place by my friend and loving it since and started bringing my family & friends there too.The restaurant is located at the main road of Singapore famous "Little India". So, finding the place is pretty easy. Upon entering the restaurant, first thing you need to do is to order the food at the counter near the entrance and make the payment. You will soon find out the price is very reasonable for the quality of the food you are getting. Masala Dosa and Rava Idli are must-try items. Top it off with coffee or tea if you like. Free drinking water is provided.The restaurant is air-conditioned and decorations are simple. Service is always good. There was an incidence when the food produced for my friend were below quality. When we provide the feedback, the food was immediately taken away and a new replacement was in place within few minutes. They always cooked the food upon order to keep it fresh. Further to our surprise, our following order of coffee and tea was waived-off as a gesture of goodwill.Highly recommended to try out this authentic South Indian Vegetarian Restaurant and you will soon find this a gem to recommend to your family and friends too
1
First time to MTR, after trying all other near by restaurant have been there, just ordered 1 Masala Dosai, it was black in color (Extremely roasted), not at all nice, but masala was ok. Size is the smallest ever dosa I had. I do not recommend this place until unless you want to eat for the name MTR
5
The food is very tasty and their signature dishes like the vangi bath and besi bela bath are just yummy!. Anyone who goes here to eat will definitely come back for more. Though the food is a little bit pricy, the quality just stands for it. The atmosphere gives a great Indian Home feel located just opp the temple @ Serangoon road
4
Second visit and coming back for more! Healthy, nutritional and tasty! May be pricey for some but save some $ and enjoy its authenticity with the whole family and friends
5
This is one of the authentic South Indian Vegetarian restaurants in Singapore. I had pretty much sampled most of the items in the menu here. They are as always very tasty and the customer service is very good. The ambience is good and only thing is the place is small. The prices for some of the items are on the higher side - like one Rava idli for SGD4. Only complaint is that they do not serve meals for dinner
5
There are many restaurants in singapore, many imitate food from their original places, but not as accurate and as authentic as MTR!MTR is the best in Bangalore, India, and it exactly tastes the same in Singapore. The place is a little cramped and a little chaotic with the number of people trying to cramp in, but it does not bother you even a little bit once the food gets to your hands, you would forget everything around while you enjoy your food.Every item is prepared fresh and hot, tastes wonderful. Forget the artificial smiles and forced service of big named restaurants, this place has a small little charm packed in a small place.I never missed any Indian food anywhere around the world, this place helps the cause by giving me what I love in Singapore!I will be back! and back... and back
4
Since it got opened last year we are a regular visitor. We just love the variety, quality and taste of food
5
The food is amazing, the restaurant is clean and the staff is extremely friendly. Everytime we're home sick, we head straight to MTR and we get our dose of Bangalore
4
We really liked the food. We would like to have a little more variety in the Sunday menu. My wife wanted rawa dosa which was not available. Of course we will come back.
4
I am huge fan of mtr in Singapore. Being an vegetarian, this is the place I regularly visit. My preferred dish selection is Masala dosa+ poori + filter coffee , sometimes, supplemented with sambar vada. Even though there are plenty of restaurants that provide this menu, the unique taste provided by mtr pulls me to this restaurant. i have been there several times and never felt any compromise in taste and quality. Being at a walkable distance of 5 mins from farrer park mrt is an additional advantage. The only concern is it gets very crowded during the weekends, especially, during the breakfast/lunch/dinner and hence, we had to change our plans at the last minute
5
Always a delightful culinary experience - excellent repast prepared per authentic recipes using original ingredients, very high hygiene standards and a pleasant ambience; excellent value for money. We visit the establishment often with family and friends for brunch. Favourites - signature Rava Idlie, Masala Dosa, robust Decoction (filter coffee). Other preferred dishes - Kesar halwa, Poorie Sago, Bisi Bele bhath. The South Indian meal offers a combination of several menu items. Must try the aromatic Rasam for a great aperitif - we enjoy it as a soup. The manager is most courteous and helpful with menu suggestions.- Capt Lal
5
This Restaurant at first place highly clean and neat. Really feel south indian taste. First restaurant I could see in singapore where we get nice food and good service.

MTR gives you, first, a feeling of authenticity to the South Indian Food with subtle variations in the preparation and serving. The range of food is predictable but they provide a consistent quality that you expect of MTR. The service staff were courteous, pleasant and the speed of delivery was amazing. We ordered in the counter, went to the table and we had our first meal waiting for us. Tables were clean and so were the other facilities
5
Its our friday hangout place in Singapore. Always reminds me of home when eating food here. Top quality ingredients, safe, clean and healthy. All my friends in office and around Singapore simply love eating here. There are other good south Indian restaurants in Singapore but in taste MTR beats them hands down. Must try:- Masala Dosa- Khara baath- Bisi Bele baath- Rava idli- Akki rotti- filter coffe
5
Authentic fresh and light southern vegetarian Indian food. Fantastic tea and coffee to top it all off after a great meal
2
In Little India I looked forward to eating a typical South Indian meal at MTR. However I was very disappointed the food quality was poor, the service was basic and the toilet facilities were very poor. In fact if I had seen the toilet before the meal, I would have skipped the restaurant.The only positive feature was a "tripadvisor" business card at the entrance which asked for client feedback
5
The rava idli, masala dosa is a must try so is the bisibele bhaath and akki roti. Food tastes great and also pretty authentic. Everyone who likes and savoura south indian food, must check it out !! Plan to on weekdays aa on weekends sometimes you might end up waiting upto 20 minutes
3
Good Veg south Indian Food. Bisibele Bhath is very nice and a must try!!!Service is bad as you have to order food on payment counter and then catch a table. Note that its bit crowded on weekends.Little expensive compared to other south Indian restaurants in Singapore
5
There are several people who South Indian food. If you are searching for one MTR is the right place. The food there just reminds me of the yummy food my grand mom makes in Bangalore( south India). The dosa is served with typical South Indian chutney and sambar and a small bowl with ghee ( clarified butter/ melted butter). The coffee is just wonderful . They serve mouthwatering dishes. If you ever want to eat a typical South Indian food then you've got to come her
5
I have just eaten a mouth wateringly good and spicy Spicy (bit not too spicy!) Indian Vegetarian meal at the spotlessly clean "MTR Restaurant" in Serangoon Road, opposite the ornate " Sri Vadapathira Kaliamman" Hindu Temple. For a modest 6 Dollars I demolished an outstandingly tasty and satisfactorily brittle "Masala Dosa" pancake, with its tangy spiced potato stuffing and accompanied by a spiced tomato curry dip and a chutney dip. That was swiftly followed by 4 Dollar "Poori Sagu", two fried unleavened bread pancakes, which arrived as hot inflated balls but swiftly collapsed on the plate, with its two taste bud teasing dips. Feeling in a glutinous mood, I finished off with a scrummy four dollar pudding of "Baddam Halva", a gelatinous concoction of clarified butter, evaporated milk, with crushed almonds and saffron. Sheer culinary heaven and served by charming waiters in very clean, air conditioned comfort. The only tragedy about this no frills but excellent restaurant, is that it is closed on mondays !Andrew Bruce, Dumfries, Scotland, U.K

I regularly visit Perumal temple on every saturday and after darshan i visit this restaurant for breakfast. One thing to keep in mind when coming here, You will pay 50 cents to 1$ more than what you pay in other restaurants but that extra amount is for the best taste and quality together. Tasty food , best quality, Clean ambiance ... nice place to go with family :
5
MTR takes pride in its hygiene standards, and rightly so. This place has good food, and the overall experience is amplified by the ambience which is significantly better than any other similar restaurants in the area.
Also, they have some innovative dishes
5
The food in MTR is very good. It tastes exactly like the dosas I used to have in the MTR in Bangalore. The staff are very friendly and nice.
5
Excellent food during each and every visit. Made with love, served with care and eaten with relish. A must try. You will be back for more.
5
We are a big fan of indian food, but never ate south indian food. It was really tasty!! The manager was very friendly and gave us good advice.
5
The tiffin items are very good and delicious. Service is good. Good place for an south indian veg eaters!
5
MTR has the first restaurant outside India. It's quality, service and cleanliness is like ORIGINAL in Bangalore(near Lal bagh.) Its the only South-Indian vegetarian restaurant where Iddly, Dosa and Bisibella is authentic. I am told they are planning to open in DUBAI, USA and other cities of the world. It's WORTH the visit. It's true vegetarian dining. I have been there many times and hope to be there -every time I visit Singapore
5
MTR Is my all time favorite restaurants actually i stay in hubli but when ever is go to bangalore i will never miss going to MTR for tiffen...so while going to singapore i had tiffen in MTR & was telling to my friend about MTR but when we reached SIngapore & came to know about MTR in singapore we were proud & happy that there is MTR In Singapore so took my friend there the tasty was awesome of all the foods same taste as in Bangalore....i stayed in singapore for 4 days daily i would have lunch In MTR...Thanks To MTR for having u r restaurant in singapore..
5
MTR is one of my all time favorite restaurants , having grown up in Bangalore - where the first MTR restaurant started and is still the place to go to if one wants the best ' rave idli ' ( steamed dumpling made of semolina ) , masala dosa ( crispy lentil crepe with spicy potato filling ) and authentic South Indian filter coffee ! The MTR restaurant here also maintains the same standards and the food is simply superb . The staff is always courteous and the service is super efficient ! I always come back happy and satisfied - feels good to have a great meal without having to spend a bomb ! I would totally recommend this place to anybody looking for healthy, tasty vegetarian Indian food
4
Dosa craving and finding a clean indian restaurant in Little India is a bit of a task- but MTR scores and surpasses. A wonderful family run restaurant, attentive service and good food. The idli vadas were excellent. The dosas were ok but the sambar fell a bit short. I'm North Indian so maybe my palette expected a little more spice and tang. Loved how the story of the restaurant was told on the walls. Overall warm ambience and good to satisfy a South Indian meal craving
4
I love food down there, but last two days continuously the gentleman (short fair guy) at the counter shouting with his staffs. Very very annoying and don't feel like going back even though I like the food
5
no matter the food was little expensive if we compare other south indian restaurant,but the taste was mind blowing ,bissibalebath was top of the world ,i would recommend all travelers who like typical south indian food ,this is the palce
5
Really glad that MTR is now in Singapore..wonderful food and good service! The masala dosa and bissibela bath is to die for!
5
simple, subtle, neat, easy on the pocket and most importantly brilliant food. The gentleman at the cash was extremely helpful in recommending dishes. One of my best restaurant experiences.
5
Its like a home away from home. The rava idli, bisi bele bath and the khara bath are to die for! Anyone lookin for authentic Karnataka food - look no further
5
We were in Little India and looking for a meal. Thanks Tripadvisor for leading us to this restaurant! As we live in Singapore we have eaten a lot of Indian food but no Southern Indian food yet. The manager came over to help us with our decision. No regrets! A mix of spicy, sweet, savoury and earthy flavours as you hardly ever find in another kind of cuisine. We loved the history of the dishes artfully displayed on the wall. It is clean, with the normal Indian tube ligthts lighting up your plate full of yumminess. I would say when your in the area .... GO
5
Great location and excellent food. MTR invented the rava dli decades ago and even today make the best that I've tasted. Everything comes with a some pure ghee (clarified butter) in a small cup, which enhances the taste. I would strongly recommend visiting MTR, the pride of Bangalore in India. The lunch thali is a great option as well. The restricted opening hours are a bit of a downer compared to other similar places like Saravana Bhavan. Prices are slightly on the higher side but the quality is evident. If you like South Indian food, this is a must go
4
MTR is an ideal combination of tasty food and excellent value for money. The staff is very friendly and eager to go out of the way in serving the customer. This is a restaurant with "Heart" and human element. Hygiene standards are very good. I have been going there ever since it started operating in Singapore and a regular visitor
4
The quality of food was good, but a bit on pricier side. Also the quantity may be less compared to other Indian restaurants.After giving orders to the waiter, you must pay first at the cashier counter and then only food will be served. If you decide to order additional dishes, you need to again pay for it at cashier counter.A Kannadiga friend of mine forewarned not to have coffee here as it is not up to the mark, so didn't try. Don't take my word for it, would be glad to hear feedback from others.Curd vada was very good. Greatest plus point is location. It is located right opposite Perumal temple on Serangoon road
5
Went to MTR yesterday. Amazing value for money. The food is fresh, not oily or overspiced. Service is excellent (but we went at 2:50 pm just when the restaurant was about to close. Staff was friendly, and there were not too many patrons at that time. Perhaps the best value for money in Singapor
4
I visited MTR twice this week while on a visit to Singapore. First was at 08.30 on Wednesday and then at 10.30 on Saturday. The food is fabulous. Perhaps the best South Indian that I have had anywhere in the world. But the service suffered on Saturday when it was crowded. They actually forgot to bring us the Dosa!But the best food ever.
4
It's needless to comment on the awesomeness of the food here....however I couldn't appreciate their rigid menu which is day wise and also the South Indian meal spread can be improved....
5
The food is fantastic and not too rich! This is so unlike yhe usual Indian Fare u get around Serangoon Rd.
Slight caution tho: traffic (cars + pple) on weekends and eve of Public Holidays around that area can be a huge nightmare!
4
Very very testy food, you feel like eating home cocked food. Value for money and compete satisfaction.
4
We frequent this restaurant usually once a month on a Sunday to get our dosa fix. Clearly this place has the best dosa in town. I don't usually state anything as 'best' but having tried a lot of dosas in Singapore and abroad, I feel I can say it is the best. The restaurant is very clean and the kitchen is visible from the restaurant. Kitchen staff also wear masks whilst preparing the food. We have tried the masala dosa and the plain dosa here. It's always crispy and a little thicker then dosas I have tried elsewhere. Definitely worth a visit
3
it was a saturday dinner. the queue was long and you have to lineup to order & pay first to collect the token and get seated. if you forgot anything or want to order some more have to come to the cashier with the token and just add-on.if token not there you may likely to be stopped by few to question you as the place may be full. the "bisibelabath" dish is tasty but very chilli hot for me. their dosa verities are bit burnt on one side unlike other indian dosa but the best of all i had is gula jamun though quite big in size it tastes really very nice
5
There are restaurants where people go to be seen, restaurants where people go just for the ambience and the style, restaurants where people think expense is directly proportional to quality. And hearing about a restaurant called Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, I would normally become a veritable "food racist" and completely dismiss a place with a name like that.But I'd be wrong!!! MTR is a tiny little piece of culinary heaven, placed in the heart of Little India in Singapore. It seems to be a very run-of-the-mill typical Indian restaurant, with people scrambling between tables and talking loud enough for the priest in the nearby temple to hear the menu and today's gossip. Then your senses take over and the first thing you notice is the cleanliness. Spotless! You order at the counter and take a seat and are hoping for a south-Indian meal that tastes like, well, any other south-Indian meal. While waiting for the food (which doesn't take more than 5 minutes to reach your table), you get a view of the kitchen where the entire staff is dressed in clean uniforms, with hair caps, gloves and surgeon's masks.Then you take the first bite and you feel like a cartoon character, your eyes just popped out of your head and your tongue started wagging and your heart pounded in your chest and your tummy made a loud gurgling sound saying "do that again, do that again!!!" And you realise that you just had a bite of pure south-Indian cuisine, the likes of which you "knew" never existed, that's made in "desi ghee", that makes your taste buds do somersaults, that makes you stop talking and start hogging and that confuses you about what to eat because you want to try everything on that menu if only you had enough space. Once you're done, you sit back and relax and breathe a sigh, not of relief but of disappointment. There's so much more you want to sample and members of the family that runs MTR will be standing nearby to tempt you with a tiny bit more, to squeeze into that already exploding tummy, in the most polite and humble way which adds to the whole experience of the place. But wait, it's not over yet, you still have to be bombarded with a bill that defies logic in a place like Singapore. Yours truly has already asked the ever-smiling elderly gentleman at the counter if he was sure he hadn't made a mistake and that I only had to pay that little.Considering that I've never been a fan of south-Indian food and that we live about 15 kilometres away, my wife and I have been to MTR 4 times in a month. For all culinary experts and other hungry souls, MTR is not just a restaurant, its an EXPERIENCE.It truly is that elusive "Diamond in the Rough"!!
4
MTR should engage some one to manage customers at the entrance. They need not devote so much space for the cash table. They need to add more eating tables & serve faster. All we can now see it is complacency of being an MTR. Food is over rated, taste is not consistent (on some occasions it's really good) and for additional orders customer has to go back to join the line( some times you relish a dish and want more). They can use a automated line management system using SMS or like a bank
5
Always lived in Bangalore, i remember my grandfather used to take us as kids to MTR, loved the food. Went to Singapore in October, first time for me, had to try out the food at MTR, it was really nice to get authentic MTR food in Singapore, loved the ambience and spotlessly clean.The food was amazing, tried a little of everything, Bisi bele bhath was out of the world and so was everything else. The coffee at the end of my meal was the perfect end to a delicious meal at MTR
5
Its my first time at this restaurant. The place is clean, food is good. I tried the masala dosa and its really good. I also tried the lunch set meal consisting of poori, rice and different types of curries, including sweet payasum. I like it because its not oily, unlike many other indian restaurants. The service was fast as well
4
After walking as tourists through Little India we decide to go into this restaurant. It is very clean and this will be our first contact with Indian food. The recepction was very warm and they suggested us with some specialities. We enjoy all of them. Spicy but not too much, it was a very tasty dinner. Thus I havent been in India I imagine that the food there should be something similar to this. I will repeat this place if i come back to Little Indi
5
Spotlessly clean giving it a pristine outlook. Bodes well for a gastronomic delight and efficient and quick service.
If you are looking for southern Indian meals to satiate your appetite, then this is the place.
Akshobh.
5
After spending some time in India and eating a lot of local food, I was impressed to find this little taste of India, just the way I remember it! It's not a flash restaurant but it's very true to its heritage.
5
This my first visit to this restaurant. first feeling the place is neat and clean(no doubt this is a small restaurant). Then the food(Masala Dosa) is so yummy and the coffee(filter coffee) is great.. The prices are reasonable. . I will come often. Cheers!!
4
Just loved the dosa and rava idly here.... And of course not to forget the wonderful coffee :-) a must visit place for all foodies & Indians!!!
4
Having food in MTR is a part of your lifestyle if u hail from Bangalore. Then living in NZ and Australia meant that we could enjoy this food only on our trips back to Bangalore. After relocating to Singapore recently, one of the best things that happened on a visit to little India was MTR which is so close to the Farrer park MRT station. We've been going there so frequently that we get a known nod, a "you again" smile from the staff :-) . The ambience is great, the food is good and very affordable, the restaurant is convenient to get to and the taste takes me back to my childhood memories. Wha more can one ask for
5
When MTR Restaurant was established a few months ago it replaced an earlier all-vegetarian south Indian restaurant that had been a bit of regular weekend haunt of ours, not least for the Sunday buffet. But their closure meant the complete refurbishment of the shop and a wholly new establishment. MTR is a long-established restaurant from Karnataka; the food is fresh, with well-balanced flavours, and well priced.On entry, one chooses from the menu at the front desk and pays, which makes it all pretty easy. The clientele is almost completely Indian - indeed, I'm usually the only non-Indian so at times my eating style is observed with some interest but not intrusively.The kitchen is spotless; the kitchen staff are all in uniforms and wear face masks; the front of house staff are courteous and helpful. Around the walls are large framed stories of the restaurant as well as a few awards from The Times of India.I can't speak for the authenticity of the food, though other reviewers have; but after a few years of living in this area, I can say that MTR is an easy choice, typically for lunch
5
When I heard MTR had started in Singapore, I was not having any great expectation about the place, since the one branch which they had opened couple of years back in JP Nagar, Bangalore was to say the least was just about average. But since we had been to Perumal Temple couple of weeks back, thought of just giving it a try as its just across the road from the temple. Went there in the evening time with my wife just to have Bangalore's version of Kharabath, but ended up having Kharabath, White Uppit (recommendation from the hotel cashier), masala dosa, neer dosa, dahi vada and cup of filter coffee. Each and every item was simply mindblowing and was so tasty and we were actually feeling extremely light even after having all the above items :) I loved the Bangalore style chutneys :) The price is slightly on the higher side, but seriously the food is value for money and the place is extremely clean and staffs are extremely cordial and well mannered. I am planning to have Set Meal today at MTR and I am saving myself to try out my favourite Bisibele bath for Deepavali weekend. I am really glad MTR is in Singapore and wishing them all the success :
5
My husband and I were grinning much before we sat down - supremely glad that MTR had finally walked into Singapore!! We weren't disappointed one bit. The masala dosa, bisi bele bath and pongal were straight out of MTR's kitchens in Bangalore - authentic, simple and brilliant. My husband isn't even Indian and he wouldn't stop ravishing about the food. Go when you are hungry and try the bisi bele bath, khara bath and sambar vada. And if you are a Bangalorean, you will love the fact that they all speak Kannada!!!
5
Quality food and service with a smile- two reasons for me to go to this restaurant regularly. The set meal is simply delicious, with a good variety of dishes and in the right quantities. With reference to previous reviews, might I add that MTR has a decent menu now, and it is definitely a must-visit place for anyone craving for authentic South Indian food
5
What amazing meals I have had at MTR both times I have been with friends and family! Lovely, healthy, low fat foods cooked to sheer delightful perfection. I love it that the ghee comes on the side so you have the option to add it to your meal. It is wonderful
4
Loved to visit mtr, very happy that namma MTR is now in Namma Singapore... we(Singanndigas) are pleased to have this resto here..
5
Great Lunch set at very cheaper price, Food is Simple but very Authentic Taste. The various types of Bathare also amazing.
4
The Dosas, the bisibelebath, chandrahara, vada .. some of the mouth watering delicacies of The MTR..now in Singapore. The service is very very good with kannada speaking staff. Our must weekly visit. Thnk u MTR for coming close to where we live.
5
You will find many South Indian restaurants in Little India Singapore...but this one is very special. Food is exactly what you would have in Bangalore. Don't miss the Khara bhath (spicy upma) ...the dosas are absolutely super...slightly thicker than the ones you get in other restaurants, cooked in desi ghee.Service is good. Order at the cashier as you enter....food arrives on your table swiftly and with a smile
5
I haven't eaten a lot of Indian food in my life, so i can't judge the authenticity. But tastewise, i can only say "Amazing"! It was the best food I had since I got to Asia 3 weeks ago
5
The food is absolutely mind-blowing which has no comparison with other restaurants offering south-indian food in singapore, as it is way above them. Its food is close to the South India flavour. We look forward to eating there everytime. It is also a pleasant reminder for my father who used to visit MTR Bangalore during his childhood days. Its also good to see the place always crowded. I will definitely recommend my friends and relatives to go to this place

I ended up eating in MTR Restaurant Singapore on a Saturday evening by pure luck, and was more than happy when I exited - can't wait to go back already!Anyone who has eaten at MTR Bangalore knows how long you need to wait in the queue (which is well forgotten once you are digging into your food) - however, I was lucky to get in early at 5.30 pm, which is when it opens up for the evening. Great thing that I did, because the entire restaurant was filled within five minutes. You will only be doing yourself a favour if you show up early!I ordered Masala Dosa (S$6.00 per plate) which completely swept me off my feet. It is complete value for money and simply transported me back to Bangalore. The dosa is thick (unlike many other Indian restaurants which make it wafer-thin) and the hint of mint chutney along with the sumptuous masala inside render it an instant-hit. I have no words to describe the chutney and sambhar that come with it, it is perhaps the best I have tasted in a long time.Next, I tried Bisibele Bhaat (S$5.00) - arrived in its full glory, complete with ghee in a tiny 'battlu' on top. This was the highlight of the meal, and the onion raita and mini-papad accompanying it added a great twist to the already fantastic dish. It's served piping hot and this is the go-to dish if you want a guaranteed taste of Karnataka!Last, ended with dessert. It was 'Saturday Special', 'Chandrahara', for S$5.00. I got my Dad to explain the meaning and read it about it on their beautiful and equally informative boards on the walls. This Indianized French pastry is worth a try, and will definitely appeal more to those with a sweet tooth. I must also stress on the great service and the friendly manager who oversaw everything. You place the order for the food yourself at the counter, unlike most other restaurants where you order at your table - whilst this concept is familiar to me, what I loved was the system in which it was carried out. You are assigned a number which is placed on your table, and remains there until you finish your meal - extremely efficient and innovative. Also found the boards used o feature the 'specials' interesting - you write on it and it glows! One of the best restaurants I've eaten at in a long time, and perhaps one of the first I definitely want to go back to. Thumbs up Namma MTR! :

Authentic Bangalore food in Singapore! Was long awaited. I agree with other comments that the quality of food is far better than any other South Indian restaurant in Singapore currently. It is a pleasant reminder of my visits to MTR in Bangalore. The only feedback I have is, when the place is crowded I see a drop in the levels of service and confusion among staff. I am assuming these are initial glitches that shall be overcome as the team matures

1. Authentic karnataka food with awesome taste, 2. Not much waiting time though its crowded during the weekends,3. And did not find it expensive at all. People expecting a luxurious fine dining will be a bit sad, but those who have been to the original bangalore MTR will know what to expect in that regard.All in all , its a restaurant worth visiting once and I will surely visit again

I am very much impressed by this high class restaurant serving excellent food. It is different and far better than many Indian restaurants in Singapore. Yesterday I had Poori Sagu and coffee and was delighted by the high standard of the cleanliness and the brilliant taste of coffee and poori. My best wishes to the management of MTR in Singapore

Being a Bangalorean in Singapore, this place is a heaven. Four generations of my family have dined and are dining at MTR. This place means much more than food, although food is the best part according to me. The food is delicious and it tastes almost the same as what it does in Bangalore. Most Indian restaurants in Singapore have had a very bad track record and MTR is a welcome change. I love it so much that I dine at MTR at least 4-5 times a week and I've been there twice a day for the past week, even though my office space is in the CBD. By a fair margin, this is the best Indian restaurant in Singapore. I had tears of joy when I had my first bite at MTR Singapore; the same old taste.My personal favorite dishes are Idli, Chow Chow Bath, & Gulab Jamun. Their lunch set meals are quite good as well. I'd love it if once a week (Saturday or Sunday) they have the same style of food serving as they do in their Bangalore Lalbagh branch for lunch; have a massive lunch meal where you are served nearly unlimited portions in a large sitting area.The staff are generally friendly and very nice. The lady & gentlemen at the cashier are very friendly and greet you with a smile every time.A lot of feedback is that the prices are expensive. I don't find the prices expensive, and when you consider the hidden ++ charges (service charge & GST) which most Singapore restaurants charge, the pricing is on par with similar restaurants; although there isn't any comparable restaurant when it comes to quality.I wish they opened up more branches in Singapore and soon.Keep up the good job and I'll visit you at least 4 times a week

South India's authentic restaurant in serangoon road singapore. During my visit to singapore i visited MTR .... I had dose ,Rava idli and coffee for breakfast.. Taste the same as Bangalore MTR, felt for a moment i am in Bangalore MTR If you want to experience the traditional south indian tiffin items, try out MTR when you are in Singapore. The best item served here is hot masala dosas, Rava idli and MTR coffee .. ....... You really feel at home. ... Especially When you are away from home. ...Yummmy food ...great experience..

Good South Indian food but the prices are somewhat higher than the other South Indian Restaurants in the vicinity. Rava Idly was good (it is not readily available in other restaurants) but the vada though fresh and crisp, was a bit too oily. The place is clean and clutter free and easy to locate and is just a 5-7 mins walk from Farrer Park MRT

Excellent food was offered but the choices were limited. It was like Apple doing its best to provide one good tasty meal. The food was quite on the expensive side but the taste was marvellous. We wouldn't be frequenting this place like others in Little India but we would definitely visit this place when we have a craving for Bisibela bath and other Karnatak food. A must visit place if you like this style of food

We had an evening snack and were overall satisfied with the food. The panels on the walls have a bit of background about the founder and establishment and these are done quite tastefully. A digital screen also shows the dishes on offer with a brief description. It is priced a bit higher than other places nearby but only marginally

I had the opportunity of visiting MTR in little India last month and still can't stop yearning for the food. Loved the crisp dose doused in ghee and the hot coffee went with it beautifully. Seeing the crowd, I was a bit deterred, but it was well-worth taking the risk. Loved the old Bangalore ambience, the smiling owner who went from table to table enquiring about our experience, all this transported me back to India. Super-delicious food especially the sweet.... just added to the whole Indian experience. A must visit for anyone looking to experience India in Singapore

First it was so surprising to get a table at mtr which we did'nt get at Bangalore for several times.Restaurant is attractive with traditional pictures of original mavalli tiffin room.coffee brewing&other displays are attractive to enjoy .menus are coming with ingradients&very nice pictures in led displays.Coming to the taste we were there for our lunch.pooris were nic e&fluffy but the sago is slightly salty .white channa was so plain&the quantity also very less.sambar&rasam were just right with their original mtr powders. Dessert on that particular day was saffron sweet rice which was good.rice quantity also less,but they had given curd rice in the thali itself which made some justice.Overall the quality was average to our expectations

The workflow is very disorganized.. Need to pay first before ordering.. Cannot jump queue for second order..The pricing is too high for comparable quality restaurant ...

I was quite apprehensive about the quality of food as most of the Singapore branch of famous Indian restaurants have been disappointing. MTR proved to be a pleasant exception. The dosa is just like what you get in Bangalore - crisp but at the same time soft. All the other Bangalore specialities are also very authentic - Khara bath, raw idly etc. They have even managed to get the old Banaglore culture - slow and un-enterprising !!! While the food is great, I was a bit disappointed by the ambience. I wish they had made the restaurant slightly more upmarket. In summary definitely worth a visit

MTR is one of the famous restaurant in South India. It is famous for dosas, rava idly, rava upma,etc,etc... I was very happy to know that MTR is opened in Singapore and i already visited there for 3 times in a month. Food tastes really good and you can have a south Indian meal in just 8$. If you are thinking to visit a temple in morning and planning to have break fast outside you can go to this place which is opposite to Srinivasa Perumal temple. You can try dosa,vada,idly which is really good and don't forget to have a fresh coffee tastes wonderful. So i must say those who are missing Bengaluru style of foods u should visit here

Wow..... Had a wonderful breakfast in this restaurant. Food was so delicious for its price. Price is too costly for us when compared to other restaurants, but the taste and the quality of the food is very good . Could make the restaurant more spacious and more waiters needed. Only two of them are there to serve us which will not be enough

Recently went for lunch to this newly opened restaurant in Little India, as a group of 6. It was incredibly busy at the time, but organisation setup is really odd - you queue up at the cashier to order and pay for your meal and then move to an available table, where your meal arrives when ready. This suggests orders were electronically transmitted to the kitchen - makes you wonder why they cant just have tablets or ipads handed out to guests at the tables directly. If you want to order any further items, you go back to the cashier, but can hop the queue! The food was excellent and fresh - its a limited menu, but the dosas, idlis, bisi bele and curd rice were all delicious - and the pineapple sheer at the end was terrific too. Service is also patchy, they missed our coffee orderand it seemed hard to get attention. So go there for the excellent food, but dont expect anything else

Visited twice, once in their first week, and again 3 weeks later. On our first visit, we had the idli and dosa, both good but some suspicion as to whether the ingredients are fresh or whether pre-packaged MTR ready-to-eat food is being purveyed. This is perhaps a lingering suspicion dating back to the time when MTR had a cafe on Orchard Road ( in what is now the Concorde Hotel building)----it closed because they used pre-packaged reheated food, obviously you don't go to a restaurant for this.. On our second visit, we had the South Indian meal which was very good

MTR Singapore got good South Indian food for good price ! Try 'Bisibelebath' (Sambar - Rice OR Indian Curry mixed Rice) is a very good option, they serve with ghee. Great to try Rava Idly. Try typical South Indian Coffee.Masala Dosa is not great option here. There are other South Indian restaurants (like Raj) for this, though 
3
The location is perfect, right opposite to the Srinivasa perumal temple, the masala dosa is mini sized, there is no tea available although the menu card has tea included in it, though they claim to be closed between 3 pm and 5 pm the restaurant is open only after 5.30 pm, very less space more waiting time, looks like the sambhar and chutney's are measured and suppled, ambience ok. But most importantly the service is VERY VERY POOR. Got to recruit more people to ensure good ande uninterrupted service and they are closed by 9 pm. That is the time when the entire Singapore is out for dinner. Overall needs to be organised better.ASH
