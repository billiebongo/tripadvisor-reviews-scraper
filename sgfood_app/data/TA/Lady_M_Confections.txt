My wife and I popped in for a quick treat, and were thrilled with our selections. Lots of different options for different preferences of sweetness. We shared the layered crepe cake, and the chocolate vanilla checkered cakes. Coffee were ver good and smooth!

It was a wonderful first time experience enjoying the delicious and beautiful cakes. The cakes are unique, beautifully design and are of good quality. The staff members were friendly and helpful!

...and I loved it. Highly recommend to anyone with at least somewhat of a sweet tooth! Favourite so far is the original Mille crepe cake.

Really lives up to the hype of its Mille Crepe
Recommend its original rather than green tea flavored layer cake.
Price could be justified and ascribed to the laborious task of preparing and baking the confectionery

位於景點魚尾獅旁邊，可邊品嘗美食邊欣賞海景風光。
點了Signature Mille Crepes, Green Tea Mille Crepe與CHEKERS~ 其中，喜歡Green Tea Mille Crepe多於Signature ，因為Signature實在有點太甜~ 非常推薦大家來嘗嘗這瘋迷紐約的千層派喔!!

Great location, but completely overpriced. Two drinks and one piece of delicious cake will set you back 25.3 S$. Considering it is more or less self service and your sitting on IKEA like furniture this price strategy seems to be wrong.

The original Millie crepe cake was just too awesome! It taste like joy and happiness. Between the crepe were fresh cream. Along with a coffee or tea became Perfect combination!

Their cakes are ok...but nothing special and certainly don't warrant the queue ...
I prefer cakes from Japan as they use Japanese milk and cream, light and tasty.

Better late than never. lolActually came here back in summer(June) of 2015 when visiting the Merlion near Marina baysand. We stopped and had some cake and watch the world go by for 20min or so. Not a bad place to sit and relax after a long day touring
3
We were visiting the Merlion Park when we spotted Lady M, a cafe nearby. I remember my friends telling me that their cakes are amazingly good and are actually crepes. Needless to say, the cakes were very delicious but we feel that the price is not justifiable and most importantly, the air-conditioner was down on a hot evening and there was only an electric fan to be shared in the cafe

Met a friend at this location for afternoon tea, Had a beautiful mango desert. All the items are just gorgeous to look and and taste amazing. Will go back without hesitation
4
the cafe was cozy and has a great view of the Singapore river as well as the Merlion! I cannot understand why there are always a crowd outside the cafe even though they have no intentions of dining in the cafe though!

Love the thousand layers cake, it's always decilious. No doubt. The location is just right next to lion mermaid. 大愛它們的千層蛋糕，一直保持到它們的高水準，價格偏高，但絕對值得一試，位置在濱海灣魚尾獅旁邊，十分方便，適合稍作休息

Signature Crepe is still the best! Indulge yourself with unforgettable classic signature mille crepé with Merlion night cityscape. Frothy, light and delicious! Yum!

We did the touristy thing at Merlion and wanted a drink (not alcohol). Most other places were full and we are not Starbucks fans so we skipped it. Stopped in here for a iced coffee and a Coke. Iced coffee was warm, tasteless. Asked for ice which then turned it into a watered down drink. Was not finished and we moved on and out

Great view and location. Scrumptious cakes. However, client service was mediocre at best. Staff looked too serious and did not respond properly when we requested for some other stuff such as milk and sugar. No smile whatsoever. Not even a word to acknowledge our asks. Might not be true but appeared condescending to us.
4
Been here for more than 3 times, cakes esp the crepes is absolutely delicious, my fav combination is to couple a pot of mint tea with it. It is as crowded as usual and maybe when we visited it was quite late so every staff looks tired with stiff face.
5
It was a wet miserable evening in Singapore. My eyes popped when I saw the wonderful display of delicious gateau in the spotlessly clean and inviting coffee shop.Service was fast and efficient - no pressure to buy - large range of coffees served at your table by a uniformed waitress! She even took a photograph of me (at my request) with my cake and coffee !!4 visits in 8 days in Singapore sums up this wonderful venu

From my countless visits to and take aways from Lady M, these what I, sassy eater, find worth to try....The Signature Mille Crepes, I could taste the slightly chewy texture of the crepe, and the melting-delicately-inside-your-mouth cream, and the hint of caramel. The Chocolate Mille Crepes is equally gorgeous.The Checkers, it was a very visually-intriguing good cake chequered with vanilla and cocoa sponge, coated with the intense yet smooth ganache chocolate.The Mushroom Soup, it was said that the Shimeji, Button and Shiitake mushroom are aged for two days, which I devoured in every spoonful I took. I could taste its intensely flavoured, bursting with beautifully earthy flavour.So do me a favour, visit UrbanOutEaters to know more about this lovely venue, and do yourself a favour, enjoy these delightful cakes

Went in a big group, thus able to try out more cakes. Top three that I like was the signature mille crepes, green tea mille crepes and Gateau au Chocolat (chocolate lover will like this). The strawberry shortcake was good too. The checkers, red velvet and Arc-en-Ciel was average.Something need improvement will be the service
5
I visited Lady M ONE Fullerton with my friends who strongly recommended it me. We tried its Signature Mille Crêpes and Green Tea Mille Crêpes and both of them are excellent! I will definitely visit it again with my family!
5
The taste of mille crepes fully complies with their high reputations. Both original and green tea flavors are highly recommended. The only thing need to be improved is the sizes of chairs and tables.
3
They serve very nice cakes and excellent mille crepes. However, please be prepared to wait as they always seems shorthanded and the place is small. Not suitable for big groups.
4
nice to get a slice w tea for a break after walk.
highly recommend their signature cake.
no fancy setup, it's basic and self-served.

Lady M is one of the most delicious delicacy shop in Singapore, we love the cakes so much so even have to pay a premium price (around SGD 11+) for a cake, we would visit occasionally. This particular shop located right next to Merlion, so you get to see the view of Marina Bay area which is magnificent
5
After a long walk from Esplanade to see the famous Merlion, worry no more because Lady M will give you a rush of sugar and everything delicious after that tiresome parade. Their signature Mille Cake is to die for!!! Delicately made with layers of crepe and cream. Paired with my perfect cup of chamomile tea made my night! You might also try their Green Tea Mille Crepe and their cake of the month
5
I came to this place as a recommendation from my cousin for world's best mille crepe. And I admit that cake was heavenly! It is not too sweet, but the layers of crepes are so thin that it feels soft like tissues sandwiched between layers of lightly sweetened cream. It is a little pricey for a single cake, but the taste was memorable. I would definitely come back
5
Lady M cakes are comparable to the cakes that we have savoured at Sapporo Sweets Cafe in Hokkaido! Check out the pics of the cakes! Faves are the Signature Mille Crepe (20 ?! yes 20 ! :) handmade paper thin layers of crepe stacked with layers of light pastry cream and Checkers which live up to its name of checkered vanilla and chocolate sponge cake covered by chocolate ganache. The customer-oriented team at Lady M make good recommendations. The whole experience at Lady M @ One Fullerton will have us revisiting :)

Ive visited Lady M countless times. Been to their outlet at Marina Square(apparently closed down months ago) ,Fullerton as well as Orchard Central. Once i step into the cafe,ill look for my Chocolate Checkered Cake( i believe so) or anything that has Chocolate. Would recommend to guest that prefer teatime with a view to head down at Fullerton while those that are nearby town area to head down to Orchard Central. Well queue might be long,service might be lil slow however if your pretty much patience and understanding,you will definitely make a return for some of the cakes.Cool. Perfect place for catch up session,mini discussion,dating and also some coffee tea. Great job team. However remember to smile more. Be patience. And keep the service better each day.

Ordered 3 different crepe cake. Chocolate, matcha green tea and original. The original crepe cakeis the best out of the 3 flavours that I ordered. Coffee's not that bad but it was warm when it got to my table (not sure if its supposed to be warm or it was on the counter for too long)Enjoyed the cakes but during my visit, one of the workers (a guy, probably the manager) was talking to one of the waitress with an angry/furious look over and over again. Not the kind of scenery that i'd like to see in a cafe. Overall, its a really nice cafe with good cakes.
