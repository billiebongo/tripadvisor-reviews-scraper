Booked in here for dinner although it was a Tuesday night there was only a couple of people in the restaurant. The service was excellent. The highlight was the BlackPepper crab closely followed by the Chilli crab which can sometimes be done too sweet. This one had a nice tartness to the sauce. The wine list was very limited and unavailable wines were crossed off the list as they presumably ran out of stock but what they did have complimented the meal very well.This restaurant is located inside the Asia square food complex on level 1.

I searched the internet to find a fine shark fin restaurant, and I got recommendations for TAO. It is on the second floor of Asian tower. The manager-like attendant welcomed me and gave me a very good advice for ordering. Just fit my requirement and not too much! Well-done! The shark fin was good and particularly tasty to mix it with lukewarm rice! The cool grass water was also tasty. The fish skin fried by egg yolk was a bit too dry and thick for me. The dessert was also good. In summary, the quality of meals they served parallels the price, 90 SS for one person. For a shark fin lover, you can try this one

This is my first time eating in this restaurant, actually this also the first time we eat in this area. Located in the building beside Westin Hotel. After having a morning meeting in Westin then we try to find a food for lunch. Luckily there is a food court next to the hotel. Since my boss looking for seafood restaurant then we decide to try this one. We order like 5 item including prawns n crab and every food we order was very tasty n delicious. Iâ€™m personally highly recommended this restaurant

TAO Seafood Asia located at #02-10 Asia Square Tower 2, Tao Seafood Asia is a stylishly furnished Chinese restaurant with tastefully ambience, that's found a home on the second floor of Asia Square Tower 2. Provides a very comfortable dining environment with private VIP rooms catered for private events. It is a distinctive but good up-market Chinese restaurant Good service, tasty consistent food, with some trace of Thai cuisine combination of Teochew and Singapore origins dishes. What we really love about the exquisite mouthwatering Chinese cuisine is the usage of fresh, premium ingredients. Some of The food that we ordered such as Superior Abalone with Crab Meat over Rice, Crisp Fish Skin with Salted egg sauce, Stir Fried Fish Maw with Prawns, White pepper crab with Glass Noodles, were all tasty and well presented. The price tags are definitely high, especially for the wine, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. Lastly, thumbs up to the service Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon. Awesome!!

I like this place because they presented Chinese seafood dishes in a very nice and unique way.
Food are also tasty and seafood are very fresh.

The Atmosphere was excellent for our Valentines' Day Dinner. The Staffs were very friendly and attentive. Quality of the food was very good too. We love the place and the food very much.

Came here for new year lunch. Their Yu Sheng had abalone which was nice. Their fish maw soup was thick and full of ingredients. Their set menu had so much food! Chicken was a bit dry. All in all - I really enjoyed the lunch.

Good and pleasant service. Food is tasty and quite unique. Perhaps portions can increase a little. Cosy place and nice ambience.

We got a treat from friend for lunch. The food tasted fabulous even though we got it delivered to our office. I'm sure it tastes better when served in the restaurant. I'll be bringing my family there soon.

Decent Chinese dishes and very fresh seafood at reasonable prices in a nice setting. Although the restaurant is small, private rooms are available, making this a good choice for business meals or family gatherings.

It was our first visit but was impressed by the attentive service (served everyone plain water when she noticed that we finished our drinks). They also changed our plates often. Chilli crab was good - spicy enough which is not targetted at tourists, and the 3-types of egg with spinach was one of the best we've had.

Well. All people love Singapore's chilli crabs, but not all crabs' restaurants are worthy a try.TAO has authentically taste of this national dish and the premium quality of all ingredients. Recommended by a local gourmet 18 months ago, TAO for me is still the best compared to those well established and overpriced.By the way, no rush here, very reasonable price, excellent service. What else

The restaurant provides delivery now for a minimum order. Ordered the crabs and the restaurant's famous shark fins and the plain FUN mushroom and also the abalone rice bowl.The restaurant only uses fresh ingredients and that is one of the main selling points. The broth is nice and they actually gave 4 abalones for which you pay around 20+ is a steal, with fresh crab meat and vegetables. For a fuss free without having to get everyone to go out, it is a nice dine in option

Small restaurant so do call to make reservations. The fish maw soup, deep fried salmon skin, fried bee Hoon are fantastic.... Didn't manage to try other food despite patronising the restaurant many times because had always enjoyed the same few dishes.Quite pricey but good quality. Staff are friendly.

Good selection of dishes for Chinese New Year dinner with business colleagues service was excellent and the food choices quite varied. Shark fin soup not to my liking

I had lunch at Tao and it was fairly average. The selection is good but the food lacked taste. The service was good. The prices were OK.
4
Beautiful pepper crab was the star dish. Sweet and peppery and just plain delicious. We also had tofu and pork belly claypot. Again a perfect accompaniment. The service was adequate without being overpowering. A good restaurant without being perfect.

Went on a Sunday. Food was quite good. Serving was reasonable. Sundays are good for family lunch at the restaurant as it is quite quiet.

Had dinner here twice recently. You can't go wrong with their crab dishes, the crabs they use are fresh and very meaty - the quality is on par with the best crab places in Singapore. Portion sizes are on the small side but prices are fairly ok, considering the location (and it's nice and quiet at dinner time). We also had a bottle of their cheapest red wine one time, and it was surprisingly very pleasant. Service is a bit underwhelming though

This restaurant in the Food Garden in the Asia Square complex was our choice for dinner tonight. The food served to us was just fine, but it was the other elements that detracted from our rating. Perhaps it's a cultural thing, but while we listened to American music, we didn't have other standard features that we expected at a nicer quality restaurant. We had no napkins, we were served one person's entrÃ©e and didn't see that of the second person's until probably 10 mins. later. We had thought to have some soup, and when we asked, we were told that they offered 3 kinds but only one was on the menu. Worst of all, the published offering was a shark fin soup. We realize that the use of shark fin for food IS a cultural preference in some places, but object to this practice as a particularly environmentally unfriendly behavior.Finally, as we clearly had concluded our meal, no one approached us to see if we cared for any dessert or coffee or just our check. The hovering that we felt when we first were seated was replaced by what, indifference?Can't recommend this restaurant, but if you go, the food will probably be fine

As its name suggests, the seafood dishes at Tao are pretty good, even if not unique. Limited meat selection. Hunan-Si chuan eaters would love their fierce green chili sauce. Good for big office parties, as the restaurant is small enough that you can hire the whole venue, prices are relatively reasonable, and service is good

i visited TAO on a weekend, which was good, its less chaotic and staffs were attentive. it was early reunion for my family as we're going to be all over places come 2016, TAO is a good choice and did not disappoint. there are some items thats not listed on the menu so do ask their staff for recommendation. we had sharksfin, cod, prawn glass noodles, kailan, crispy rossted chicken, claypot beancurd, fried rice, yam paste, osmantus cake. sharksfin was pretty good i must say and the other 2 that stood out to my liking was the crispy roasted chicken and fried rice. a good choice for chinese family dining.

It was our first time trying out in this restaurant as one of our extended family members chose this restaurant for her birthday banquet. Dinner was started about 1 hour later than we planned, as most of the guests were late, including ourselves, due to the traffic jam on Friday evenings. I think we had the set menu. The cold food platter was good. The portion of shark's fin was really too big, and we were almost half full after having it. The fin could have been even more tender, probably if cooked over a longer period of time. My husband commented that could tell that the abalone probably came from tinned ones. However, that is understandable too. The fish was good. For the lobsters noodles, I could not comment on the lobsters, as I am allergic to it, so did not take any of it. Took the noodles, which I think is yi mian (in mandarin); I find it okay. Then we had the desserts. The mini dessert, a jelly came in red dates; and also on li (I think it is Teochew kind of dessert), and also a portion of birthday cakes. The desserts are not too sweet though. The birthday shao tao was served before we had the first dish. I think that maybe it should be the other way round; as otherwise after we had it, we are already a bit full. Seemed this place is good to go for dinner, as it is really quiet in the evenings. The only feedback I would give is that this restaurant uses too much msg in their cooking, so my husband and my mouth really thirsty after we arrived back home. And the waitress who served beer to my husband accidentally landed his cup on my right elbow. Luckily, nothing broken; just the peeling off of skin in that area

We went yesterday for lunch. The Sweet and sour pork done differently from the normal one I usually had. The dragon fruit really go well with it. Chicken corn soup was very nice. The seafood fried rice and steam rice were ok. The presentations of food here is very good.Price for 3 dishes and 2 soups with none alcohol drink was $128 which suitable for the quality we had got.
