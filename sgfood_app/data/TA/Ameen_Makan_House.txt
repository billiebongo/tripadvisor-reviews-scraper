I like the fried beehoon and the chinese chicken fried rice. It has a variety of menus from Indian foods, Chinese foods, Malay foods and Thai foods.

Visited this place several times. Service is good. Food is good. And these people are really nice. Cost is average. But affordable for students.

On the whole a worthwhile alternative to its famous neighbour: - A rather large selection from Thai, Indian and Western favourites, e.g. guayteaw, tandoor, pasta, etc.- Generally good quality cooking, worth repeat visits.- Prompt, pleasant service.- Great place to dine with familyy and friends.- Opens daily till late.- Just a short walk from Beauty World MRT station

We went twice to this makan place. Once was in Jan, for our dad's birthday and the other is just 2 days back. One of the staff who found out it was our dad's birthday, gave him a birthday brownie with ice cream. Such a sweet gesture for him to do that. We've been coming to this place for a few times now. Their naan, thai style maggie is yummy. Overall their food is good and value for money. Worth a try. It is also near the Beauty World Downtown line.

This restaurant is a little hard to find, even though it is located just outside the National University of Singapore campus. All I can say is, it is better to enter the address on Google Maps and follow the directions.But for a not-so-easy-to-find place like this, the journey was worth it. It looks like any other small shophouse serving Indian food, but there is a reason why NUS students crave the food from this place so much. For our dinner, we ordered Obama (fried rice with beef), plain naan and garlic naan with butter curry, avocado milkshake and dates milkshake. The food was not too dry and was really tasty. The milkshakes were great too, especially the dates milkshake, which tasted really refreshing and unique!Do drop by this shophouse for a satisfying dinner! It will be worth it

We have eaten here a few times in the past years. I recall it was pretty good, but we ordered from here for delivery last night and I was super impressed. The food was extremely good and the delivery was quick. We even had a Thai noodle dish that was also excellent. French fries for kids was a bit under cooked and

A popular place for the NUS students, this ordinary local eating house serves no ordinary food. The Tandoori chicken is by far one of the best around, moist and tender. Also must try are the Palak Paneer, Naan bread, Butter Chicken and the Mutton Briyani rice. A cup of Teh Tarik will be a perfect combination if the curry and spices proved a little too much. With most dishes reasonably priced between S$5 to S$7, it is a great place for dining out with family or friends
