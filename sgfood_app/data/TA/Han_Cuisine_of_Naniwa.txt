It was my first time to have a osaka kushikatu.
Chef arakawa is full of passion and many years experience. He told me that HAN is the no.1 best kushikatus restaurant in singapore.
Food was excellent and outstanding taste.
I do strongly suggest !!

If you yearn for an authentic experience of true Japanese cuisine, you must try out out Han Cuisine of Naniwa. Best to go for the 7 stick lunch course or 10 stick dinner course to be served on the discernment of the Master Chef.Truly not to be missed if you want to have an authentic experience of Japan cuisine here in Singapor

So this is a little off the beaten track which is great because there is good parking. There is the sound of water as one enters the restaurant so immediately one feels calm after a busy day. The chef has cooked for the emperor before he came to Singapore many years ago. The place is different because the sort of food is different. There is sashimi, sushi and Kushikatu. The kushikatu is very interesting because it is something like tempura but less oily and the sauce is different. So its like a different combination. The mustard is a little spicy and very delicious. So if you want to try something different this is the place to come.

Came here for lunch: we were both most impressed. I had the Wagyu Hamburg steak lunch set ($28++) and supplemented it with 3 sticks of kushikatsu ($18++) whilst my wife had the Okasa Sushi Morikomi Bento ($65++). All up including taxes and service charges the bill came to about $130. Miso soup was particularly good here

The Japanese samurai chef served super wonderful kushikatsu. Every stick is dedicate taste and you will truly enjoy it. Great ambience but could be quiet. Suitable for business dinner or special occasion for the date if you think about the price. Wish to go there again. You will never disappoint.

I googled through a long list of Japanese restaurants before finally deciding on Han for my partner's birthday dinner. Certainly no regrets. Service was perfect from the time we stepped into the restaurant. I had the Sashimi/Kushikatsu 7 sticks/Sushi Omakase course while my partner had the Kushikatsu 10 sticks/Sushi Omakase course. We also added in a Udon thinking that his meal might not be filling enough but it was cancelled by the Japanese head chef as he told us we would be too full and suggest we re-order later if we still needed it.We were blown away from the time the appetiser was served. Every course was also explained in detail to us by the waitress (eg. this is oyster in soy sauce, this is black bean in sweet sauce etc). We definitely couldn't get enough of the Kushikatsu. We had never tasted such light and airy batter and it was not at all oily. It was also a joy seeing the chefs preparing the food. The chefs would also recommend the sauce to go with each Kushikatsu that was served to us.Sashimi was very fresh, sushi was fantastic. There was nothing to complain about.We will be back to Han for sure, but only for special occasions like birthdays or anniversaries since the Omakase price is definitely not within the cheap range

This is a Japanese restaurant own by a Japanese man. They have a set lunch so you dont have to choose much, they will arrange for you, the selling points is the tempura, they will cook in front of you and pass to you one by one wooden sticks. Its really yummy. For the price is not cheap, around 180 Singapore dollars per head. I wont go there oven cos I think is expensive for me.But I also hink is a good place for couples, very quiet. Bring your girlfriend or boyfriend to try
