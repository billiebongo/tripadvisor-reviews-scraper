While the selection of options is large, I wasn't impressed with the portion size. You should opt for salad and soup if you want to be full.

This is a great place for healthy food. You have everything you need from salads to grains or juices as well as wraps. You can choose my tips of ingredients and their sauces are amazing.

Very expensive salad, nothing less than$10. But taste really good and the portion is satisfying as a meal. Although they can give more than 1 tiny breadstick as a topping.

We got there by accident, but were surprised that they offer such a tasty salad and even more that there are pretty good vegetarian and vegan options. Prices are a bit higher than average, but worth it to try.Service could be a bit more customer-friendly. Don't just go to the table and mention that the food is ready to pick up, but bring it as well :

At more than 10++ per salad bowl / wrap it is a bit pricey (which other good salad place is less expensive?). And add a drink or a yoghurt cup, gets more expensive!!Very few vegetarian options but the Habibi and the Summer fling, both especially in a spinach wrap, are consistently good. Portions are truly filling. Staff are quite courteous and will go out of their way to find a place for you - the place gets really crowded just before 12 noon on weekdays and remains so till about 1 pm. Good healthy salad / wrap at this place is worth a try

Waited almost 30 minutes for shop to be opened.Ordered two premium items and only got one.Lousy Quality Control. Other items chosen also given only one or two pieces.Feedback to Adrien/Katherine and got reproached for doing so by their CSO.No respect for loyal customer. Felt cheated.CH outlet seemingly only keen on profit margin and not quality.Eating Wide Awake took on a very negative meaning today.Just be careful the next time you are here or in any of other outlets. Not the first time and am sure there will be more to come.That is what happens when you expand too fast and lose control of the quality of food and staff

The Good:1. They have indoor and outdoor seating.2. Fast service.3. Standard salad stop menu.4. Good for a quick bite during busy lunch hours in this area.The Not-so-good:1. The Chihuahua salad I tried was rather blah, and not warm even though it's supposed to be a warm salad. It's funny I was served a cold salad given that there was no one else in the queue and hardly any other customers at the time I made the order.2. Seating is limited

Love this place!! Fresh ingredients, so many topping options, and lots of hommade dressings to choose from!!You can also build your own salad or wrap. I ordered the 'Iron Man' salad and loved it so much i went back and got it in wrap form to go for later! I am a vegetarian, so i definitely value a good salad!!

My teenage kids love sad stop and its our daily sunday dinner. The ingredients are fresh and I love their creative salads snd wraps. I do find the salt in the tomato soup on the higher side but other than that think its a great value for money . My kids eat the greek salad wrap with chicken and I love making my own salads so I do not get bored
