A delicious, affordable snack for anytime, anywhere! It's great if your looking for something to satisfy your hunger before going into the MRT.

The bun generally are ok, some special one will taste better. This is not my first choice of the bun but it is near the exit to the MRT so will always pass by. Promotional price of the bread will attract me most of the time

Mugiya is one of the best bakeries ever... not sure if it's only in Singapore but I wish they were everywhere, they have all kind of amazing bread and pastries and their level of hygiene is top (just what you expect from a Japanese standard) my two favourites are the Cranberry and cream cheese ben and the seaweed bread...I highly recommend if you are around City Square Mall in Singapore to experience it and don't forget a takeaway for the trip :
