7pm on a weekday is quiet. Good for dating. Too bad level 6 is having a wedding. The view is much better.

service was good, for was decent and reasonably priced :) we both had pastas which generous portions of both the pasta and ingredients were given!
4
Excellent food and service! Waiters were very attentive and patient in explaining the dishes! Love the quality of food
5
Had a really wonderful dinner at Aura! Julian’s service is wonderful! Do look for him. The lobster spaghetti is fabulous. Wonderful service crew, food and ambiance.
4
Great service and thoughtful crew. Price of food was ok the costly side but quality of food was there.
5
Been to this restaurant many tines mostly for lunch. Their service and food quality have been very consistent. I ordered a pasta last time and it was great taste and cooked perfectly to al dente!
4
The ambiance and furnishing of the restaurant was beautiful especially in light of the restaurant being in a symbolic place
5
Went for a date night while on holiday in Singapore. The service was amazing, led by our waiter Julian, who couldn’t have done more for our table. The food and wine was great and portion sizes were very generous. Julian and his colleague organised the perfect spot on the rooftop for a perfect private surprise proposal at the end of the night. We couldn’t have been any happier with how they went above and beyond for us with no notice. Thank you so much!

Spent a good few hours here, watching electric storms, spotting buildings and mostly drinking. The nibbles list is short and not great for vegetarians - I had the fried mushrooms with some sort of sauce and bruschetta, which were about all that was suitable. Both were just 'OK'. Not particularly tasty but they filled a hole. But it's the view that you go here for. 180 degrees of some of Singapore's most iconic buildings stretch out before you. Add to that comfortable seats and a cool breeze and you're set. The service is not fast. And the toilets are downstairs. I imagine that the lift would sort that out if you had mobility issues, but it's something to consider

What a wonderful place to have lunch with friends as we did or family or loved ones it has so much to offer - they have a set lunch menu which was fabulous $35 ++ or alacarte both amazing and fantastic value - we were served by a gentlemen called Saket nothing was too much trouble x
5
Big thanks to Julian for making our dinner such a wonderful one! We went on 26 January for dinner as it was our anniversary and the service was great!
4
Grey place to take your date. Beef was very good. The seafood soup was a bit cold but the taste was good.
1
They didn't have our reservation. Then they gave us a menu that was limited because of New Years Eve but no one told us. the selection was of 4 items take it or leave it.
3
The restaurant was good but too expensive
Although tasty the portion were really too small. The tortellini had only 6 pieces for 35 sgd! Otherwise service was excellent
4
The restaurant is nice with a great view. It is an intalian restaurant so the food does not disapoint. I was there for Christmas and had their Christmas menu that included several startups, 1 main and dessert.

Aura has a great locale being at the National Gallery which is a historically significant building in Singapore’s history- it was the Old Supreme Court before refurbishment. Yet, for the prices, we felt the ambience, service and food quality and portions were.. underwhelming. For instance, we’d ordered wines by the glass, the initial impression we got from our waiter was that we were ‘cheap’ by asking for a glass of red from the house pour list. Had a list of more expensive full bottles and half bottles being recommended to us. And, when the glass of wine came, no doubt their glasses seem large, but it just felt a little sad to see it filled to less than a quarter of the wine glass. Tried the Chilean sea bass and pork chop, both were tiny in portions. Perhaps for the prices charged, like their wines, they could have just been a little more generous? I believe this won’t be the only guest giving this feedback. Hazelnut chocolate tart was good but quite small for the $18 price tag (excluding taxes)
5
Lunch for 2 persons. Had the weekday set lunch at SGD 35 each and 2 glasses of wine. The 3-course meal was outstanding, from appetizer to entree to dessert. The restaurant ambiance was classy yet comfortable. It was an almost full house for lunch, despite it having a hard to reach location - top floor of National Gallery. They threw in a feww birthday cake for my wife too. Nice personal touch, thank yo
2
We were a group of three for a 74th birthday. The appetisers were tasty but very small. The wait between appetisers and main course was over 30minutes and the restaurant was only a little over half full. No apology was offered. The lamb rack main consisted of one piece of lamb and therefore should be called a small lamb cutlet. For almost $50 this was a rip off! The octopus salad had a few pieces of rocket, but again no substance for the cost. For the price, we were disappointed and would not go back, nor would we recommend it to others.
4
Overall very nice ambiance. On the top of the National Gallery. Go there in the evening and enjoy the night view of Singapore skyline. Food is generally good but portions are not big. It’s pricey for the quality and portion size. The Kagaoshima wagyu beef was excellent. Paired with a nice glass of Barolo.
4
My partner had heard great things about this place, so we had to give it a go. Making a booking was easy enough, though more signage at the venue itself would have helped. The service was great from the get go. Friendly, welcoming and helpful. He helped us choose a great wine to go with our meal. The ambiance was good. The music choice was a little odd but it eventually fades into the background. The food overall was fantastic. We would definitely recommend the tartare. It’s not a place you can go every week but great place for a date night
5
We went to lunch. Exceeded our expectations. Service was excellent. Will certainly go again. Higjtlt recommended. They change their menu monthly.
5
We decided to come here as we haven't been since it opened, it was a great choice!! The food was fantastic, view was amazing and the service staff were super attentive. Perfect choice for our once-a-week date night!!
4
Apart from poor service by the odd waitress who wasnt helpful when asking for recommendations, we quite enjoyed the meal here. Coursed brunch for 48 was super worth it
3
Good ambience for a first time visit & service staff were accomodating, attentive & friendly. overall Could improve more on the quality of food.
3
We had heard much about Aura, so decided to try. We went for dinner.As a general comment, the food and presentation were very good, but the portions were very small and the prices disproportionate. Service was on the whole friendly, if lacking in warmth, and ended on a low note when the server - presumably disappointed that we did not order dessert - plonked the bill on the table and left. The restaurant was not crowded then, so it was difficult to see what could be so pressing that basic courtesy to a paying customer went out the window
4
We were seated on the 5th floor because there was apparently meant to be a wedding on the skylounge floor on 6th floor (when we went upstairs after our meal, there was no event!). It was disappointing that the 5th floor restaurant doesn't have a view. We had the set lunch, the food was exquisite and the service was efficient and friendly
5
Celebrated a friend’s birthday at the Sky Lounge and i must say that it is the BEST rooftop bar I’ve been, in Singapore. The view was just stunning. We had so much fun especially with the great service - the staff were so friendly and nice! Will def come back here again

Myself and my partner had dinner at Aura on a Thursday evening after work. As soon as we walked in we were absolutely freezing, no table in the restaurant is safe from the constant blow of arctic air coming from the overhead air conditioning. I would recommend diners take a jacket. Food: Average, small portions. The food was very nice but nothing special, you can get similar food from just about any mid priced restaurant in Singapore. Service:The service we received was pleasant and on the whole good, however, we sat with empty glasses waiting for a top up from the wine bottle the waiter removed from our table on two occasions. Price:Overpriced. There were bread plates on the table which suggests that bread is offered, it was, however we were then charged at the end of the meal for it. Overall the experience was fine but a little disappointing
2
I decided to try Aura after a recommendation from a colleague who said it was a great experience all round.When we arrived we were immediately hit by a shock of cold air. I understand that a restaurant needs to keep their premises cool in Singapore, but the whole restaurant was freezing. We spoke to another patron at the restaurant who mentioned that she had brought a shawl especially to go to Aura as it was so cold inside.Furthermore, there wasn't much of an ambience at Aura at all.We were very much looking forward to the food but were disappointed. Having tried a number of very, very good Italian restaurants in Singapore (Senso, Burlamacco, La Strada, Osteria Mozza, No Menu and even Da Paolo) we were excited to try yet another excellent sounding Italian restaurant.The service was a little slow, but not terrible. The wine list was excellent and very reasonable, though we often had to wait in order for our glasses to be topped up. Initially, we were disappointed to be given only one small piece of bread each (normally a highlight at an Italian place). We were later surprised to find we had been charged 8 dollars for two tiny pieces of bread.When our mains arrived (Italian Seabass + Chilean Seabass) I was very disappointed to find that my fish was visibly overcooked. It was very dry and the dish was very disappointing in general. However, my partners dish was excellent.We finished with a Tiramisu, which was also very nice.Overall it wasn't a bad restaurant experience- but when you are paying 50 dollars for a main meal, you would expect a level of quality and of service that we just didn't receive.I wouldn't recommend Aura, rather No Menu or Senso are much better options for a similar pric

Had first a drink at the sky lounge and then dinner in the restaurant. Very nice location, good drinks with a wonderful view facing the cricket club. Very nice design ambience in the restaurant. Good italian food and wine list. Worth a visit during one of my next stays
5
Nice place hidden within the gallery. Great service throughout and staff were very friendly! Food was great and we enjoyed our dinner there.
4
Visited Aura because of chope vouchers. I was pleasantly surprised by the service and quality of food. Will visit again. Lunch set was worth it and the ambience was nice and quiet with other diners seated at alternate tables
4
Went during weekday for their lunch set. Taste is good, though the portion is rather little for the Main course (especially for the Lamb dish)
3
It was a nice location and had nice decor. Worth a visit. The food was ok for a nice restaurant and the service was ok.
5
we had the fixed lunch here and I have to say it was excellent. The wine list is amazing and the food was very high quality. The service was attentive and friendly. Our waiter explained that small children are allowed in at week-ends hence the atmosphere was a little more boisterous than it might be at other times but it was at no point overbearing. I'd be very happy to go bac

I made a reservation through Chope as my friend flew all the way from Canada so I decided to give her a small treat. I saw this promotion featured on chope while making the booking that for $100 worth, you get $10 dollars off so i bought two. Being heavily pregnant, the staff was very helpful and attentive and the food lived up to expectation, nothing to shout about and our night night was ended off with very good dessert. The restaurant was quiet at first, thereafter towards the end of the night when it got packed, it was really noisy and we had to raise our voices above the others to get our bill. When I called for the bill and paid using my credit card together with the chope vouchers ( which took them 20 minutes to come back to me) because the whole restaurant was packed, this waiter came over and rudely said: 'Your vouchers couldnt work. Read out the voucher code for me.'1) He could have just asked nicely to see the voucher codes on my phone (not violating any PDPA) instead of demanding it rudely like that. And I would also have happily read it out, if he had said his 'please' and 'thank you'. 2) There was nothing wrong with the voucher codes because another waiter approached him after I read it out to him and whispered something, he returned me my phone without a word of apology or any explanation and left the table. Hence, I have always been against compulsory service charge because why would I pay this restaurant $20 of service charge and get this treatment? Even children have better manners. I always tip the waiters in private if they are attentive and friendly but will definitely not give any for this waiter.

I took a small group of business colleagues to this restaurant after Pre dinner drinks at Smoke and Mirrors. The initial impression was great, service was good to start, but as the evening progressed the table of gentleman near us completely dominated the restaurant with there outbursts of shouting and laughter. The table of ten plus men overwhelmingly ruined our professional dialogue and made the evening very difficult to communicate with people even sitting next to each other. It would have been appreciated if the staff could have suggested that perhaps the volume of their table was a little out of place for the restaurant.The food on the other hand was reasonably presented and tasted nice but not out of the expected for this price range. I had the pasta which was on special which was creamy and had a nice handmade fettuccine. Nice combinations and a balanced menu offering. The best stand out to me was the quality of the service ware and the glaze on the plates. Didn’t have desert so can’t comment on deserts.
5
Had a very pleasant Sunday lunch at Aura with family. Loved the generous portioned starters (5 large plates for 3 of us), we were already full after that! Good quality, nice variety of starters.Mains were OK, although I don't care much about the duck. Fish seemed nice.As for desserts, I loved the tiramisu! Rounded off with latte.Service was pleasant despite a full house for restaurant week. Atmosphere was elegant yet relaxed , beautiful surroundings. Great value for $48 set.
5
Thank you to the great service staff at Aura for a lovely dining experience whilst celebrating my husband's birthday. It was so refreshing, and dare I say rare here in SG, to experience genuinely friendly and efficient customer service. Yogi (forgive for misspelling) was a wonderful waiter that night despite him being run off his feet in a pretty much full house. The food was excellent and the wine Yogi recommended went down a treat! Thanks for a enjoyable experience. We will definitely be back again for more celebrations and to bring family and friends.
4
I must say the complimentary warm bread was surprisingly delicious - we all had seconds!Good pastas, generous portions. The only thing was that my mum noticed a little piece of crab shell in her spanner crab pasta (thankfully it was just one piece). I guess it's proof that fresh crab meat was used.............?The iberico pork exceeded my expectations with its great texture and flavour. Dessert was decent, though if I were to go back I might go for the appetizers instead of dessert
5
Good place for celebration.
But We ordered mocktail and foods. The mocktail was not serve. We reminded the waiter twice but still not serve until we check our bill and realise drink order was not taken.
5
Enjoyed the food and the service was great. The staff were always looking our needs, but yet were never intrusive.
5
It's a wonderful experience overall. Had some wine at the outdoor seating before dinner facing a beautiful view. The food was exceptionally well executed. Ambience good quiet enough for conversation. Will definitely be back again.
5
Pricey but everything from service to ambience to food was perfect! Pastas are done al dente and some are handmade. Absolutely delicious! Especially loved the spanner crab fettuccine.
5
Nothing goes wrong if you follow the Michelin Guide. Aura sets the atmosphere just right and gives you a world-class contemporary experience.
Dishes we like: Hokkaido Scallops with Porcini and Beetroot, Smoked Duck with Foie Gras and Young Spinach.
5
ideal spot for a birthday lunch. great service & dining atmosphere accompanied with a quality menu. Lunch set was totally worth the value.
3
The service & food at Aura was good. The view at the roof top bar was stunning but the manager’s EQ & service was horrendous. She is rude , probably having a bad day, still I felt we shouldnt be treated that way on our anniversary celebration.
5
Just had our wedding lunch at Aura, and it turned out just the way we wanted. Blessed by good weather, the view from Sky Lounge was beautiful (we booked both floors). Even though we had close to 200 guests, the consistency of the quality of food was remarkable. Staff were friendly and professional. Price per pax was very reasonable too. I would definitely recommend this venue for corporate events, private functions, and even simply when you are in the mood for some Italian fine dining.
5
We brought our overseas guests for brunch on a weekend and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Beautiful place to dine at, fantastic view of the city, extensive menu and wine selection, and definitely worth a visit. Our service staff was attentive but not intrusive, he gave his recommendations on what to order as well as suggestions on what to do around the area. Overall it was a wonderful experience and we’ll definitely be back to try the dinner menu
3
This is a great place to eat if one wants good views of the Singapore skyline. The upstairs bar area provides an excellent photographic opportunity. The restaurant food was sadly a little disappointing, with very small albeit pricy portions. I received the incorrect dish as my main meal
5
I've been here twice and can't wait to go again. Great view, excellent service and food. Good for both business and personal events.
4
Great ambience, yummy complimentary bread (wish it was free flow), and of course great pastas! The service was fabulous.
Drinks were a hit and miss.
4
Special thanks to Mr Saket whom had made our dining at Aura unforgettable. But there are a couple of staffs were not as friendly
3
This place has a nice location... Averagely appointed. Extensive Wine List.
Average Food. Beef was great.
Service Excellent.
Cuttlery was poor, wines are super expensive.
Not recommended to visit.

We had a lovely evening dining at Aura. The food portions could be larger but the quality of the ingredients was good. Great service too!
4
The national kitchen was not available for lunch, so we headed for this other restaurant in the museum. Nice place, very attentive staff, pretty good food. A bit noisy, but on the whole a positive experience
4
Came here end Aug 2017 for dinner with Friend. Restaurant is beautiful, classy and with great ambience.We ordered the Grilled octopus as side, mains Fettuccine with crab & Pappardelle with oxtail and mushrooms and Chocolate&Hazelnut tart with Whisky cream for desserts. The grilled octopus was yummy cooked to perfection, nicely cooked juicy and succulent. Pastas were great as well. But I'm more impressed with the chocolate with hazelnut tart + whisky cream, blown away with all the combinations coming together and tasting great. Prices are slightly deep, spent around SGD $65 per pax, total 2 pax.

Service:I recommended this place to my office for a business dinner based on the review. Unfortunately some staff behaviour ruined the whole experience. The waiter staff came and offered that he will get something to share for the table and repeated that statement, despite the fact that each of us ordered appetisers, mains and desserts so there was no need for additional food. The waiter acted that they were doing a favor by bringing extra main and sides and then charged without our consent.I have been to other michelins' in other countries and this is by far the strangest experience. I also went to a Michelin restaurants in HK a week after this and wanted to test if this was the norm, and the waiter also offered few additions but never charged them as we never order them in the first place. Back to Aura, I quickly sent an email to rectify. The service staff who responded to my email were so polite and promptly investigated and apologised for the mistake. But when it went to the more senior staff to get the refund processed to my surprise although he started by apologising and admitting that it was a mistake, he followed up with blaming the guests. He should learned on how to respond to customer from his service staff who responded professionally. Btw we spent more than $1,300 at this restaurant. Location:Location is good as this restaurant location is inside National gallery with easy access by taxi and any other public transportFood:I was expecting better food for a Michelin stared restaurant. It's not bad at all, but it's nothing stand out from the food we ordered. You can go to any fine dining in singapore and you would have the same food experience.Price:Cheaper than any other Michelin star restaurants. Now I know why they are cheaper than other Michelin.Summary In summary, if you don't mind with ok food (it's not bad but nothing stand out) and want a convenient place to have fine dining dinner at a Michelin stared restaurant, the least you could do is please check your bill carefully. For me personally, I would rather try other restaurants even without Michelin status and I am sure I would have better dining experience

We were served by a older Malay waiter when we arrived. He was so rude after knowing that we were new to fine dining and need some recommendations and suggestion. In the end he asked another waiter to serve us, who is a very kind Indian guy. He explain to us some of the wine knowledge and always check us out during the dinner.
4
We had a faculty dinner for 72.The confit egg with mushroom and black truffle was a nice entree.The ricciolini pasta with lobster was nice to look at and tasty to eat.The black cod was fresh and served with a nice caciucco sauce.Enjoyed the chocolate and hazelnut tarte too
5
Great place for significant event like anniversary and wide variety of wines. The ambiance was excellent and definitely will visit again in future.
4
3 course meal with tea/coffee at $35 ++ in a nice setting restaurant, which is centrally located. Thumbs up.
5
Love the ambience of the restaurant & the food, especially the pasta that was in the set lunch :P
Head up to the Sky Lounge for coffee and desserts and be awarded with a nice view of Singapore's skyline :)
5
went to aura restaurant with a friend visiting singapore. we are impressed by the staff attentiveness. food wise- slightly expensive but is all worth eat. worth a try to eat the home -made pasta. its heavenly!
5
We enjoyed the ambience great service from the staffs and of cause the gourmet which is one of the best in town.
4
I was there in a group for a dinner function. The set menu was nice, small portions nicely presented, but still enough to fill you up. Started with Hokkaido scallop, a bit fishy. Mushrooms with confit eggs was much better, spicy pasta was ok, mains of beef was nicely medium and delicious, dessert was chocolate based. The night time view of the Singapore skyline was a good back-drop. Overall a nice meal.
4
We were quite a big group, so we ordered a few pastas and mains to share. The portions are quite large, in particular the pastas. But they all tasted delicious, especially the pork cheek pasta. The chocolate dessert was really rich too, so we were stuffed at the end of the meal
3
Service staff could have been more attentive such as topping up water (we did ordered 2 bottles of wine). Restaurant ambience is posh but once again staff attentiveness can do better. Food is so so for the price, pasta dishes are very salty, infact starter is much better. If going for the view only them i suggest to skip the restaurant & go straight to Aura sky lounge for coffee or drinks.
3
Was here for a business lunch & went with the a la carte menu as the dishes were more interesting than the set lunch offerings that day. Had the octopus appetiser & crab/salmon roe pasta, both which were flavourful. The restaurant's decor was nice & impressive enough for a business lunch. However, the noise level in the packed restaurant made it a bit difficult to have a deep conversation. Overall, an enjoyable lunch but there are better Italian restaurants at the same price point, with a more quiet ambiance for business lunch meetings
3
Had the set dinner, nothing to shout for at this price point (98+, supplement for some options). Not suitable for intimate conversations as resturant is very noisy. Intervals between courses are not well planned, had to wait long for some dishes (took almost 2 hours for 4 course meal). Service is explimentary though, attentive without being intrusive despite the full house. Note, wine prices are high (expect to pay at least 30 per glass
3
Don't think I will visit again. Not impressed by the food. Good but over-priced wines. The lounge was nice but the restaurant was noisy. Couldn't hear myself sometimes.
4
Pleasant environment and very attentive staff. Food is delish and pace of serving is just right. Extra bonus when the staff prepared a spot with a view for after dinner drink.
4
We were there for the set lunch menu. They graciously substituted dishes since we were vegetarian.
However the actual set menu would be far superior to the put together vegetarian menu for us.
The service was excellent and the ambience good. Do try
2
Location not so bad,service very slow and messy ,Food very basic nothing special
Not worth a visit
For the location I expected something more
3
Food other than the appetizers were good. S$48 per person for the set lunch was almost a steal, i.e. if you do not opt to top-up $22 for the sirloin. Service was not as expected for a restaurant of such setting. The staff could definitely do with some training or re-training. We were seated near the bar and could literally hear everything the staff talked about including some personal stuff!
3
Nice place to dine if you’re here for a National Gallery event. Food’s decent but, rather pricey. The tortelli was pretty good but did not live up to its menu description. The hazelnut tart on the other hand was excellent. My only other beef and source of amusement was with the bread basket which was huge but contained only 1 piece of bread.
4
The national Gallery is a must visit , and besides the National Gallery and the exhibitions , several rooftop bars and restaurants make this a must visit in Singapore. Aura offers a great bar and a really good restaurant with plenty of great choices , food is really good , Italian inspired , plenty and very reasonable price , great wine selection , and super service - highly recommended 
4
The location was definitely the reason I went back again to catch up with friends. Dinner and dessert weren't my favorite but drinks and bar snacks were good to catch up with friends and enjoy the view of Marina Bay Sands. This place would be great if you enjoy view
4
You can visit the Gallery during the afternoon then end your day with a dinner at Aura, and perhaps a drink. Its a brief walk to public transportation so you can walk some calories off and also do some window shopping and stroll on the way
2
The food is really not worth a second visit. For a fine dining restaurant, the standards are quite poor. Had the set dinner at $98. The appetizers were not too bad but the uni and ikura was a little fishy. The worse was the main course where the duck was chewy and the fois gras was tasteless. Was over cooked the first time, sent it back and when it returned it was slightly less overcooked; but very bland. You will also notice that the crockery are not worthy of a fine dining restaurant. Not refined. Will not recommend
4
I was there for a dinner with colleagues. The food was delicious and a fast service. The location is very nice as it is on the top floor of a museum.
4
Great food served by helpful and friendly waiters/waitresses. Romantic place for couple as AURA is located at National Gallery with great exhibitions and perfect city view all day and night. Beautiful citylights at night, especially.
2
A great place for drinks overlooking Singapore's skyline and Marina Bay. Located at the top of the beautiful National Gallery. We found the food very rich. The heavy use of truffle oil meant you couldn't taste the other flavours of the dishes. Only a dash is needed otherwise it spoils the dish. My fiancÃ© enjoyed the fish, but not much choice for veggies like I. Skipped dessert as all too rich. Had to go for a long walk afterwards
3
We were there for lunch over the weekend and ordered their set meals and an extra portion of pasta. The food was underwhelming and the wait time between starters and mains being served was long . Service was friendly, the restaurant was at three quarter capacity and and a plus point for those with kids is they allowed children in during the weekend. Given the competitive market for set lunches, there are better restaurants for the same price point with better innovation and quality of food. We will be back to the National Gallery, but unfortunately, not to Aura.
4
I brought my boyfriend to Aura for his birthday dinner and definitely, it did not disappoint. The ambience was amazing and their service was on point that night. We ordered a few appetisers and mains to share. For appetizers, highly recommend the Grilled Octopus with Crispy Egg and Corn and Scallops Crudo with Truffle and Smoked Quail Eggs. For mains, I loved the Spagetti with Crab and Porcini! For desserts, we got the chocolate banana cake. After dinner we headed up to the 6th floor for some drinks at the bar and we were really lucky that night as there was fireworks!!! I would definitely recommend Aura for any special occasions! (Full review - link in bio

We visited this restaurant for the first time on Father's Day dinner, not so much for Father's Day but for a special family event. We got seated on the Sky Lounge floor.Atmosphere: Semi-formal. There is a nice view of the Marina Bay Sands and at certain times, one can enjoy the light show.Service: Somewhat underwhelming - the waiter acted quite flippantly and did not seem very attentive. The servers served the wrong dishes to us a number of times.Food quality: My pasta was very nice while my youngest felt her pasta was ordinary. My wife's steak was not bad. Another daughter's cod fish was not nice but her ravioli was good. Overall: mix - 2.5/5Prices: Expensive.Would I return to this restaurant? Unlikely as the food was not exceptional for the prices. Nor is the atmosphere. For a Michelin starred restaurant, we left unimpressed
4
Referring to the Aura Sky Lounge (and not the restaurant) located at the rooftop of the National Gallery.Cozy tables al fresco, a delectable cheese platter, grappa, cocktails and wine make for a truly happy hour (or hours!) after work or just before dinner.The panoramic view is priceless
4
Located at the 5th floor of singapore national gallery . It is an Italian restaurant and the waiter Alvin was fantastic , he recommended a good wines for the dinner as well as the must eat food . It turns out well! We have slow cooked octopus , burrata cheese with truffle oil, pasta with special mushroom of the season with white truffle , grilled lemon sole fish is out of the world but pork Chop can further improved but is tender and juicy. They have sky lounge assess to view the whole Padang and marina in your door step .. do catch a drink and enjoy the view 
3
Been here many times for business lunches. Used to enjoy the business lunch set. But my recent meal turned out to be average with the seabass not as delicious as before. The fish did not taste that fresh. My guest ordered the pasta which looked delicious though.
5
We made booking for dinner at Aura Restaurant (5th floor of the Singapore National Museum) but decided to enjoy the Singapore sunset and skyline by having dinner at the bar on the rooftop 6th floor. Our request was accommodated by the very friendly staff serviced by Ana. We ordered three appetizers to share and were pleased with the presentation amd tastes especially the grilled octopus and truffle burrata. We also discovered happy hour is 5-8pm except for Friday and Saturday evenings. We recommend the views of Singapore Skyline and sunset; and of course the seabass dinners were very well prepared.
5
Outstanding, perfect view from window tables and terrace, plus great Italian menu. Excellent Foie Gras, Buratta, linguine with asparagus.
4
Everything was good except fo the air conditioning. The air seemed stuffy. The condition was better after an hour when they increase the wind speed.
4
Great Ambience and Friendly Staff. Food was also reasonably price and taste great. Only thing is that probably they should open slightly later till around 11pm .
5
Loved this place! We craved fresh vegetables and Aura has a whole buffet of salads at a reasonable price. Delicious little dessert treats at the end were a pleasant surprise. Enjoyed the views.
4
We had the Mother's Day special menu. Was delicious. We had wine by the glass as bottles start quite pricey. Great experience overall. Mom was happy!
4
The food very good and well presented . Good selection of wine .
The waiter gave good service and my family enjoyed the meal.
But I find that the air condition wasn't cold enough.
4
Located on 5 th floor of National Gallery this Italian fusion style is good. Food is enough on your plate with nice and original taste.Nice for lunch , atmosphere casual chic, it can permit you to go on the terrasse to appreciate the view on the marina bays
5
A very nice interior design. The view is on the inside courtyard of the national gallery. Don't expect a view on the pandang / singapore landscape. The booth sitting are very cosy.Great service. Nice presentation. Proportion are right sizes. Not too small not too big. Must try : the truffle filled burrata. Good wine selection. Special price on Perrier jouet champagne. I would have expect higher quality of desert/pÃ¢tisserie. It's is good, but nothing surprising.

The ambience is great, good for a date. Service is good although I had to keep waving to get the waiters attention. The food... had some hits and misses. - The burrata was ok, the cheese itself was good but I didn't like the sauce pairing, the truffle had a mustard like kick which was annoying. - The Fettuccine pasta was good, interesting usage of prosecco although couldn't really taste it- Didn't enjoy the sea bream, both the fish and vegetables were way too salty- Mont Blanc was very bland, didn't have enough matcha or chestnut taste and the texture wasn't memorable either- Baked Cheese cake was great with a nice lemon kick and pleasant combination texture to the palat

Knowing the chefs reputation and reading reviews we had high expectations but left completely uninspired and for sure, not on our list of repeats.The food was only fair/good and nothing approached great. There are no lack of choices for excellent Italian food in Singapore. The noise level was unbearably loud. For our table of 8 was impossible to hear the other end of the table and all of us commented how the low ceiling was providing a terrible noise level.Larger tables are expectedly more difficult and as frequent business's diners we expect as much. But, the service was down right bad, not due to their pleasant nature, there just wasn't enough staff. Dessert took 30 mins from order to delivery (nothing backed!) with our coffees being consumed 20 mins before dessert. We flagged them down to take orders, clear plates, chase down the bill. After paying we never saw anyone all the way out the door. Enjoy bar upstairs and the great view, but there are far better Italians in Singapore to enjoy

Aura has an amazing view of Singapore for Prosecco and chats with friends. It also has a really classy restaurant space for dinner and drinks. Our wine was served ice cold and the food was delicious. The service was also impressive.

The appetiser of octopus was very good. The service was commendable as they went out to get a non sweet dessert for my Friend to celebrate his birthday instasd of a cake 😊

Excellent food and service, really enjoyed our visit to Aura, good menu and good selection of wine too. Staff were very attentive, We would go back for sure
3
Service and view was really good, but probably a place to enjoy the desserts (had baileys hazelnut cake which was good) and drinks, rather than the mains which tasted so-so
4
Start with a cocktail at the rooftop bar and enjoy the amazing skyline and then finish with a wonderful dinner at the restaurant . Food is really great , good selection and plenty on the plate , really a recommendable place for a night out 
5
We went to Aura for lunch on a day it was raining, so the overall ambiance was amazing given that the full length glass windows made everything seem softer and nicer. The food was tasty and beautifully presented. Service was excellent, very attentive, always ready with suggestions. We will definitely visit again.

A good place to chill in semi formal/casual wear (no slippers please) with an "atas/high class" feel and price tag. The restaurant is on 2 floors, and I recommend calling to reserve the top floor as the views are better. You can sip wine and take in the sights of Marina Bay in the outer deck, and the staff can usher you in for the meal proper inside once food is ready.There were fireworks that evening we went but 3-4 service crew were standing on the outer deck blocking the view. Maybe they should not stand in an area meant for customers to enjoy the view? They were standing as a group so the view was really lost. But the service was good and polite overall, so we do thank them for that. The pastas were good. Skip the sliders appetisers. They serve free still water so don't have to take the sparkling water offered unless you like sparkling water Check your bill. We had one extra item that was later removed.

My Husband chose this restaurant to celebrate my birthday and our wedding anniversary and he struck gold!!! We decided to have a drink on the rooftop bar beforehand. We arrived into the restaurant. The staff were polite and welcoming and showed us to our table. Our Waiter was equally friendly and chatted easily to us about the menu and the recommendations of the day. The food was sublime. Absolutely delicious! At the end the Waiter came across with a beautiful dessert/cake with a candle in! Highly, highly recommend this amazing restaurant. Thank you to the staff for making my birthday and our anniversary extra special

The bar located at 6th flr of National Gallery Singapore. I visited Aura last two weeks and was sitting inside as its drizzling. The view from where I sat was great, with the light music background, its really relaxing. The bar was quite quiet when I visited. I just love the ambience and the cocktail. I'll try the outdoor seat on my next visit
3
Booked for lunch and loved the location and views. Sadly the food was just ok. It could be SO much better. The presentation of the dishes was of a high standard, but mostly lacked substance, and on the bland side. We hoped this would be a highlight lunch, but instead left feeling slightly disappointed. So we headed out to enjoy the views again
5
We visited this restaurant as a large group of about 50 people. The food was laid out beautifully and the combination were excellent. We enjoyed a wonderful evening at this restaurant.
1
Pushy and extremely aggressive waiters. Was shocked by how bad the service was despite the high end nature of the establishment. Food is nothing to write home about. Average at best. Avoid this place for the service alone!
1
Overpriced, low quality and loud.
Absolutely place to avoid. I sent back 2 dishes and I found them on the bill.
Horrible
5
This restaurant is a wonderful destination spot that serves tasty, inventive and nicely plated food in a wonderful ambiance. The service also matches the culinary fare.
5
The asparagus pesto accompanying the sinful burratina, tiramisu, pasta and grilled vegetables were all out of the world. The service was great but I think they need to reduce the preparation time as the wait on the table is prolonged. Lovely open space and the wine list is extensive. The venue is lovely and the ambiance is great too. View from the open deck is amazing. Worth a meal

We came here for a rehearsal dinner for a wedding . Aura is located on the top level of the National Gallery , with indoor and outdoor area. The view of the marina bay , sands casino , art performing centre , cricket grounds all outstanding , especially at dusk . The party took over the the indoor lounge completely with 80 people , a set menu with wine pairing . We were surprised the service was very good and server very attentive ( I had food allergy and they provided another dish ) Salad , followed by two pasta , a main dish ( chicken a bit dry ) a Decent for banquet food. . We planned to return to try theca la carte men

Lovely elelgant dinner venue; Prem who served us was excellent. Appetitsers were fantastic: loved the grilled octopus - the crispy egg was a nice surprise! My partner had the beef sirloin and was singing praises. My tagliolini was a slight disappointment as the scampi was 2 miserable limpy deshelled shrimps, though the pasta was ok. Was expecting more attention on the scampi. Only like the cream on the strawberry shortcake. Will think twice about visiting again, maybe will stick to chef's recommendations to be safe.
1
LOCATION Hard to find. Anonymous and so noisy borderline intolerant. Cheap looking materials and overly pretentious SERVICEOk yet anonymous again. Can't say much about itFOODPoor quality and presentation. The carpaccio was good and yet the steak poor by any standard. No taste, not properly cooked - I asked MR to R and got it M. Moreover the prices don't reflect either service or experience. I don't recommend it and will never go backCIA

It is unbelievable how things can change in three days, but this is what happened. Had a decent experience on Monday when my wife had lunch with Caucasians- she had a decent vegetarian set lunch with a pasta made in pesto sauce as a changed option. So she took her Indian friends for a treat there today(Thursday). Served by an absolutely rude Indian server who didn't know what a pesto sauce is, her entire experience was pathetic. He refused to deviate from the menu, when pushed, he still came back with a pasta in tomato sauce, and was just downright insolent- he was implying she didn't know what a pesto sauce is! Overall experience and food was pathetic. She actually asked for the server to be changed- another one came along and went and still got a pasta that was with some other sauce-but not pesto. Did get the feeling that this overall treatment was reserved for the three of them because they were not caucasians
3
The lunchtime salad bar is decent, but no one dish is outstanding. The hazelnut feuillete is not bad, but overpriced at 18SGD++. Three members of the waitstaff attended to us at separate occasions, and one did not seem trained at all. He came to our table asking for orders for drinks, and when we asked for warm water to begin the meal with, he smugly told us to walk to the counter to have out fill WITHOUT checking if the dispenser had hot/warm water. Located at the 6F of the National Gallery, the best part of the meal experience is the panoramic view of the Marina Bay skyline. This restaurant is part of the Il Lido group, and service in the restaurant in Sentosa is much better, so I truly hope that management pays a bit more attention to this outlet. I would like to see this place do better
2
Overpriced overrated food. I guess you pay for the location and view. But if you're having lunch... neither of these make up for the poor value-for-money when you dine here.
5
Hubby and I were there for dinner. Ambience, food and service were excellent!! Wide variety of food and wine. We were spoilt with choices 💑
3
We had dinner with a large group of friends. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Food quality was fine but a bit expensive for the portion size. The portion size for the pasta was decent but the sea bass was quite small.
4
We were impressed with the restaurant ambience & deco, the fine touches & cosy lighting made the dining experience great. Service was excellent, the food was good but I find some dishes too salty for me
5
Fantastic dining experience! Good food, great wine, excellent service and lovely ambience! Will definitely come back again!

One of my favourite spots in Singapore, Aura is a gem of a place with one of the best views in the city (set back from the Marina Bay area) The National Gallery is a wonderful setting and I'd highly recommend a visit to see the exhibitions either before or after lunch too. In the evening the rooftop often gets hired out for private events - but as a relaxed lunch option then Aura is wonderful - food is on the pricer side but the lunch set menu is very reasonable. Booking essential
2
We been to Aura for our Corporate event last year and it was really good. We make another visit on 13 March and was utterly disappointed. We are not being treated well and only 1 service staff to take care of a group of more than 26 pax. We were not communicated that the corkage is S$50++ and worst still, the wine serve is S$150++ per bottle. We have given instructions that need to be very careful of the spending and yet everything was not communicated. Shock of our life. We are not being serve with a smile. We deserve to be serve well and not there to see the unfriendly face. I think is seriously not worth the money and we will not go there anymore. A real disappointment
4
A little disappointed with the noise level at aura, perhaps there was a couple of gatherings going on that day. I wont recommend couples who want to have a nice and romantic dinner to go there anymore. Food was pretty good apart from some flavours that didnt turn up too well, for example we had the burrata cheese but the sauce was a tad too musky for our liking. Foie gras was done pretty well though. The waiter, Sakit was amazing too. Kudos to him for recommending a nice bottle of pinot grigio which went fantastically well with our dishes. If food and ambience couldn't match up to the slightly extravagant price, the service he provided was the saving grace
5
Whenever you have a chance to drop by, make it Aura for a Singpore Sling. The view across the training ground with MBS and the new skyline in front of you is breathtaking. Be sure to stroll through the National Museum -with a great new and modern annex before!
4
On the 5th floor of the national gallery, with a bar area that affords fantastic views of the MBS and bay, the restaurant is a great place to just have a drink or enjoy dinner-Service is friendly, the food with good portions and tastes good - appetisers are large portions and actually would be enough . but they are a touch pricey.Menu is a but limited in variation which is what stopped me upping form a 4 to a 5.... but is good enoug
4
Veg pasta was excellent. Seafood was average. Bread was actually very good and we had
Few rounds of that

Good place to chill out. Favourite Place although on the pricey side. Service is generally acceptable.
3
Slightly pricey but everything was good. Service was very very good. Food was okay. some dishes were very good, some were ok. Decor and ambience is very very good.

We used the eatsingapore book to get us here. We ordered duck and lamb and both were exquisite as well as the burrata appetizer. Good quick service and nice atmosphere.
1
Dined at Aura for the first and the last time! The food was utterly bland and lacks complexity in the taste. The presentation was a tad disappointing, despite charging such high prices. The bread came air dried and seemingly not fresh. We had to ask for another helping to be sent over. Pork chop main course was served cold and after one bite, we sent it back. Instead of cooking a fresh portion, they reheated the food, drizzled some dark colour sauce and served us. Appalled by the fact that this was done, we asked for the manager. His attitude was even worst as he said as a matter of fact that they reheat food and serve to customers in such situation. He was not apologetic at all when we asked if this is the practice of the restaurant of such supposed standard to reheat food and serve to customers when food was first served cold. He thought by removing the item off the bill entitles him to be rude to customers by saying in an indifferent manner that " I've taken it off the bill"! That's really besides the point. I was even more flabbergasted later when I discovered from his name card that he was the GM, and not just the manager. No wonder the Restaurant has such poor standards as the GM himself lacks basic customer service skills, actually condoning cold food to be reheated and duly served!It's such a shame to house such a restaurant in the National Gallery of Singapore

Aura is located at the top floors of National Gallery, offering a fantastic view over Marina Bay from the bar. So you can really enjoy while having your drinks there. However staff could largely improve their attention to customers, more smiles, a few "thank you",... would be appreciated.Then we had dinner there (but no view), and it was more disappointing.Despite promising menu, and dishes being nicely presented, the food is average - I went for salmon tartare which was really salty, and then a Chilean sea bass which was tasteless and really watery (coming out from the freezer...?). Besides the wine list is absolutely PROHIBITIVE ! Offering a standard wine at 200$ the bottle is clearly exaggerated, so you better stay on tap water, unless you really don't care about it.Service at the restaurant was really good (far better than the bar)
4
Aura placed in beautiful decor setting, table layout of 5th level National Gallary. Staff is friendly and attentive. The menu is diverse and sounds exciting, however either bit rich/overwhelming (i.e. foie gras and bone marrow without any brioche to balance) or a bit bland (as tasty as the wagyu sounds..).
4
We had the weekend brunch at $48 price earnings ratio pax. This came with 5 different staters! There was 2 pastas, 1 with crab meat and the other mushrooms, calamari with a tomato sauce dip, bruschetta with tuna topping and burratta cheese with rocket salad and Parma ham. The 2 pastas were OK. The standout from the starters was the Burrata cheese dish. For the mains, I had the Kalimantan wagyu which was good but it's actually not equivalent to Japanese wagyu as there marbling was very little. This was a $22 supplement. The dessert was the Apple crumble. The mains and the dessert were excellent.
5
I usually do not write restaurant reviews, even when I have had a good experience, but this was an experience to remember, so I shall make an exception. Aura is located at the top of the National Gallery. Needless to say, the view is incredible, and would itself make for a memorable visit. It has to be seen to be believed. The interior of the restaurant itself was classy but cosy. Food: We ordered the set lunch, which costs $48++. We were given bread and olive oil to start, followed by an array of delectable sharing appetisers, which complemented each other well. For the mains, we had a choice of snapper, duck or sirloin steak. This was followed by dessert (either tiramisu or apple crumble) and coffee or tea. We thought that the food was better than what we had expected given the price, and the helpings were generous.Service: With a great location and excellent food at a reasonable price, one could be forgiven for expecting the staff at Aura to be somewhat snooty. Aura has a prescribed child policy, and I feared that they would be hostile towards us for sullying their restaurant by bringing a 22-month-old child with us. As it turned out, this impression could not be further from reality, and in spite of our humble trappings and the presence of a child, we were treated as if we were members of the ruling oligarchy. The staff who attended to us were professional, attentive, warm, and friendly, and a waiter who attended to us even befriended the child. When he overheard our conversation that one of us was about to celebrate a birthday, he served her Auraâ€™s signature dessert, Baileys & Hazelnut Feuillantine, an absolutely heavenly dessert that is highly recommended. Aura should also be complimented for the professional way they handled my reservation. I had sent them an email about a particular date I wanted to make a booking for, then used Chope to make a booking for a different date. In spite of the confusion this engendered, shortly after making the booking, I received a helpful call from one of their staff who spoke perfect English, and at once dispelled all the confusion that I had caused.In view of the above, I was surprised that the restaurant was only half full. On this occasion, I did not order any wine from their very extensive, but I shall absolutely have to go back again and do so

It's been almost a month since we decided to celebrate the NY Countdown party at Aura Sky Lounge and I shudder whenever I thought about at how terrible an experience it was. Despite having a reserved table and paying a healthy sum, there were No party packs , lousy customer service and what countdown? the DJ/MC whoever he was must have in the loo during the crack of midnight. Just to pay for the view from a higher point was a terrible mistake. Will not recommend nor will I ever attend their so called parties
4
Perfect place to have a great view of Singapore fusion of old and new skyline - MBS, the CBD area and greeted by the grand Padang space in front. Pretty romantic too!
1
Came here for dinner with my bf. It's bad food for a high price. Don't bother. I would not recommend.
5
I've been a regular st Aura for the last 12 months. It has always been a pleasure, with consistent food quality, good service & wide wines selection
5
Went there for a drink with friends. Really nice atmosphere and absolutely beauful view on Marina Bay Sands.
You can relax and enjoy the view.

Visited the National Gallery over the weekends. Beautiful awesome place. The sky lounge is beautiful. Had dinner in the lounge and food is excellent. The Scallop Crudo is beautifully carved. And also the Chilean sea bass. My wife is also happy with her Crab Spaghetti. It was a Friday and the place was packed. Everyone is scuttering around. I would say service is compromised as all the staffs are busy. Despite of several waves and trying eye contact with anyone, I couldn't get any attention. I tried to wave to the few mangers who has been standing at the counter (for the last few hours) talking, but to no avail. And finally, when I caught one of their attention, they diverted me to another female staff who is busy at that moment. Well....I managed to get my water top up in an hour.Anyhow, I guess management should set good example for staffs to work as a team. But nonetheless, kudos to the awesome food that we will definitely return. Probably we will get more attention if we sit at the alfresco
4
The was the second time at the newly renovated supreme court, but the first at Aura. First of all, the views at the bars upstairs, both Smoke and Mirrors and the other one, are worth the visit already. However, the restaurant is good as well, excellent Tuna tartare as starter, followed by a perfect pasta; a dente and well spiced and well filled. The wine list is extensive, but really lack some reasonably priced alternatives. The Nerodavola we selected was real good though. This not a real casual place and the service is great and somewhat formal. Enjoyed it really
4
For $48 or $98 with free flow Prossecco and 3 courses you would assume that the food would be mass-produced nonsense. However, the 4 starters were all excellent (and you get all of them, we didn't have to choose), and it's worth the extra $12 for the black cod. The portions are all generously sized. Outside of the Freeflow menu the wine is over priced and unappealing, and the pours are not particularly generous. The service really wasn't great either, but we may have just been unlucky with one newish/forgetful guy. All said though, excellent value if you stick to the set menu.
5
Booked a table for $500 that includes a bottle of Dom Perignon. Great view of Singapore skyline and fireworks which was the highlight of the night.Had 2 bottles of wine before opening the bubbly for countdown @$125/bottle. Service was top-notch. Not the cheapest place, but it's worth every penny
3
The rooftop area is very nice. The restaurant is Ok, rather on the more expansive side. Food choice at lunch is Ok, but not great. If you do want any changes do not expect the staff to be understanding, as when you tell them that you can not eat something they do not give you a choice for the alternative, just bring you something else and surprise, if you can or do not like it, they are not happy but leave it on your table.... Won't come back
1
We spent a very pleasant morning at the Singapore Gallery, and having reviewed the restaurants available in the gallery, decided that Aura would be the choice for lunch. We were ushered to a table that had no settings, however having read other reports of Aura, found that this was ok. The ordering process was fairly smooth. My wife's glass of water took more than 10 minutes to arrive and my Diet Coke was closer to 20. We were presented with bread and olive oil fairly quickly. When my meal, which was a simple pasta dish, eventually arrived, more than 30 minutes after ordering, it wasn't as ordered. The waiter was apologetic and after conferring with his colleagues, asked me to wait a further 10 minutes. My wife's meal that required no cooking had yet to materialise. For what purports to be a high quality restaurant charging premium prices, this isn't good enough.Needless to say, we didn't stay
4
Attended a wedding anniversary luncheon and fall in love with the awesome view! The sky lounge is on the 6th floor. When you step out of the lift, you are enthralled by St Andrew Cathedral, Westin Hotel, the Padang and Esplanade to your left. Right in the center is the panoramic view of Marina Bay Sands and the CBD district peppered with OUB and OCBC building sprawling the skyline to your right. The view is breathtaking. I can visualize myself having drinks in the patio and drinking in the view in the evenings! The restaurant is beautiful and cozy inside. The food and drinks were good but not fantastic. They have a wide selection of juice and wines. I had vegetarian food and was not impressed by it. My spouse had beef as his main and he was not impressed either but that could be just us and our expectations. The only and most disturbing issue was the staff attitude during the ceremony. They were talking very loudly in the local dialect with complete disregard to the ongoing ceremony. I thought that the Manager would caution them to quieten down but that didn't happen. It was distracting, very insensitive and totally unprofessional for a fine dining restaurant. I am not too sure if it was the behavior of the wait staff or management as they were all gathered at the bar counter/area. Having said that, they were most attentive and professional during the luncheon. They were very prompt and quick in the serving.Overall, it is a good venue for couples, family and friends gathering though too noisy for couples on romantic dates. I am giving it a 3-star rating as the food standard and staff attitude definitely needs improvement
1
We actually didn't really get to sample Aura's food or drinks since we came from the other side of town to enjoy the view but even though there was a row of empty tables of 2 and a bunch of tables under plastic sheeting for 4 on the deck, we got refused as a party of 3 by one of the surliest waitresses ever. I guess that's why the restaurant is half empty on a Friday night.
4
1st time at the restaurant. Was a little apprehensive before the visit due to the mixed reviews. But I am glad to have made the trip for the weekday lunch set.Bright cheery setting, hearty portions, food was above average, service was acceptable, staff were polite, waiter served us was prompt, constantly checked on us. I think service can go a notch up if staff were warmer. The meal was value for money at $32++. And this is at the posh National Gallery.Will be back. Recommend the set lunch
3
Tried the Grilled Octopus with Crispy Egg and Corn, Pappardelle with Oxtail and Mushrooms and Tagliatelle with Pork Cheek, Kale and Pancetta. Found the taste to be average though the ingredients were fresh. The restaurant was very crowded even on a weekday evening and very noisy and loud, not sure if this is because the ceiling is not high...however the waiter did allow us to have our dessert at the Sky Lounge and the view was great! The dessert, Baileys & Hazelnut Feuillantine was really good! Overall I wished it could be better as the expectations was high.
2
Heard a lot about the view and the atmosphere and of course what attracts there is that it's a roof of a national gallery. When arrived with the friend for drinks - full of people, extremely noisy, waiters are not attentive as they're super busy.Food is average. View - if you look at the horizon - is good, but right next to the gallery there is a sports field and when they have a game on - projectors are directed pretty much at the terrace - not a comfortable feeling.I wouldn't come there again to repeat this experience. Seems they use their location as the only advantage..
5
It was a first time for us to this restaurant which was for my birthday dinner with my fiance and i loved every bit of it! The attentiveness of the service staff, the smiles, the food that came right away and also the portions plus taste! There is not a single negative feedback that i could give. Even the house pour wine and price was just right! This is a must go for anyone who wants good food, nice ambience and really good service
4
I went to Aura with couple of my friends on a weekday and it was quite crowded. Thankfully, we had made a reservations.It is quite a fancy, posh looking place.I loved the food! Special mention to the burrata cheese, the burrata stuffed ravioli and crab porcini pasta. Absolutely delicious! The service was quite prompt as well. However, it was quite evident that person serving our table was slightly miffed at us for not ordering a lot of dishes and for being confused. Also, for such a fancy, fine dining place, we had to ask them to change our plates after we were done with the appetizers. Same goes for the cutlery. That was a bit disappointing.Also, the air conditioning ducts are placed just on top of the tables and it is quite freezing inside. As a result, the food gets cold pretty quick. Do remember to carry a shawl and to finish eating as soon as the food is served!I will of course go again just for the food and to try out other dishes on the menu
2
The appetizers are fantastic. The pasta is good. we ordered a medium well lamb and it came out rare. Sent it back and it came back medium. Manager was rude about it. our server was polite and gave us a free dessert. red meat craving not satisfied. Would have been nice to have been given one of their booths considering we were 4 pax instead of being seated in between couples
5
Took my wife for her Birthday Dinner together with our children. We were greeted by Alvin who was our excellent host and overall great entertainer for the evening. Started upstairs for a cocktail and great views and then proceeded to the Restaurant for dinner. Great Food, great wine and overall first class experience. Highly recommended
3
This has been a good addition to the dining options near the Padang area of Singapore. Ambience is decent and service is good. But if you get carried away and leave it to the waiter to arrange dishes etc for you, you may in for a severe Bill shock.....Cocktails are average. Smoking is strictly not permitted anywhere in the building
1
Service levels could be further improved on many aspects. Unethical and dishonest to swop a champagne without informing reasons for so doing it. F&B outlets in National Gallery are aplenty, such as Violet Oon or Yan, part with your money wisely.

One of the best trained and most courteous staff I've encountered in the city
Good snacks and drinks menu
AMAZING views
Great for corporate parties

Oh dear, oh dear. Singapore service meets wanna-be high-end establishment.  First up, let me say the food at Aura was very good. Two of us had Sunday lunch there and ordered two pasta dishes (burrata and spinach ravioli and crab spaghetti) plus mini burgers and all three were really lovely. The burgers in particular were excellent and good value for the quality and quantity of the ingredients. Also, the venue is above average. It's on the fifth and sixth floors of the National Gallery and you get excellent views of the city either side. There's plenty of space between tables, too.  But then we come to the service.  The staff are pleasant but just not very efficient. Here's what happened. We walked in (without reservation) and were greeted by a smiling, if slightly stressed-looking, waiter. He showed us the menu. It looks good and we see plenty of empty tables. Very promising.  We chose a table for two by the window. There was no cutlery on the table, nor indeed on any of the other tables unoccupied (about half the tables were empty). You would think that a place that serves premium food would at least have all the tables nicely appointed with cutlery, napkins, condiments and glasses. It just looks so much more professional. Anyway, not a biggie. We quickly ordered food and drinks. The drinks came and were heaped together on the table -- not laid to the right of each person as you would expect in a high-end establishment. The waiter disappears, then returns with forks and spoons a few minutes later from a plastic basket. He leaves. Then returns with olive oil, then again with the bread, then again with side plates, then again with the food. Another waiter brings the napkins. Why it took six visits to set up our table is beyond me.  Overall, the service was a bit chaotic. It's like some of the staff have been plucked right out of a Chinese restaurant -- workman-like service but no grace and no appreciation of five-star service that is supposed to match the five-star food and ambiance.  Aura staff need to be trained properly. Failure to do so hurts this restaurant's image
5
We had our dinner at first level of Aura. Their people service us promptly and I had a well cooked sea bass. The ambience was fantastic. Going to the bar on the second level, the view so amazing and romantic. Totally immersed in the great moment with the orange warm light all over. It's a great place to date! Cheers
4
2 visits within the week because it was worth going back for the truffle pasta. Done aromatically with fresh shrimps with scent of the truffle waffling to your nose when the waiter sets it on your table. another must try is from the dessert selection. Baileys & Hazelnut Feuillantine & Amedei Chocolate & Banana Cake. I had the set lunch earlier & tried the Duck Confit which came out a little too dry for my liking. Otherwise taste-wise it passed my test

In case you are wondering why there are such different reviews here, there are 2 venues: The Sky Lounge on L6 and the Italian Restaurant on L5.The Sky Lounge has some of the best views in Singapore, but is expensive and can be hard to get in. Book ahead.The Italian Restaurant, with the amazing Alvin to take care of you, is wonderful in all respects except no views. And is not deserved of the low Tripadvisor rating, which I think come from the Sky Lounge reviews.From the website:Aura's 90-seater Italian Restaurant and sprawling 200-seater rooftop Sky Lounge overlooking a panoramic view of all of Singapore's iconic landmarks, Aura is the ideal venue for private events. From chic cocktail receptions to elegant sit-down dinners, Aura offers a variety of menu choices and customised packages.My ratings are for the restaurant
2
Every time I come here there is an event on at the sky lounge so Saturday brunch doesn't happen. No one ever knows what is going on and you call in advance to check and they fail to tell you it's closed for an event. When you do go the waiters are useless and never know which menu is the menu of the day. Soulless and dull. Never busy for a reason. Badly managed. Shame because it's a great locatio
3
Aura is situated on the 5th floor of the grand and imposing National Gallery. We had dinner there recently on a Saturday night. It was full house so there was a constant buzz of conversation. What we did not expect though was to have to put up with a few screaming chiplaying tag or crawling under the table in the restaurant

We visited Aura on Saturday night with another couple. Apparently we'd hoped to go the the upstairs restaurant but it was closed for a private function. It made no difference...we had a fantastic night. The restaurant itself is in the National Gallery building. It's a very stylish, cosy affair with excellent lighting and mood. It's prices are reasonable for a Michelin started venue but you'd have to be prepared to spend money. In my view, there were two amazing things about my visit to Aura. The first is the menu; it's one of those rare menus that, although extensive, I struggled to choose. I wanted to try everything on it!! The starters are creative and original, the pastas are full of unusual ingredients and the mains are...well....wonderful!!We tried the "scallops crudo with truffles and quails egg", the "burrata with tomato and olives" and the "grilled octopus with crispy egg and corn". All super delicious although the scallops topped the vote at our table. We shared two pastas between the four of us (who says you can't share in a five star restaurant?) and the two we chose were sensational! The "tagliatelle with pork cheek, kale and pancetta" and (my favourite) the "linguini with clams and bottarga (fish roe)", with a smack of pepper and the creaminess of the roe!Our mains were the "duck with foie gras" (Super rich and earthy), the "pork chop Milanese" and the scallops....all wonderful! We complemented all three courses with a couple of bottles of a delicious Barbera. The second amazing part of our experience was our host Alvin, who has been with the restaurant for many years and is passionate about making sure that you know as much as you want to about your meal, that you are choosing a well balanced menu and that the wine makes sense. That kind of involvement isn't for everyone, I get it, but for me it was a stand out and turned a great night into one of the best service experiences I think I've ever had. Thank you Alvin. Aura...my new favourite restaurant in Singapore!

We went to Aura Sky Lounge as part of a large group business dinner. The staff was exceptionally courteous and efficient and, even with the large number of attendees (~50), the chef and prep team kept the menu creative and with excellent meal presentation. Each of the main courses were enjoyable and the multiple servings kept flowing. The views from the restaurant and bar are alone worth the visit.

Our son took us there for pre dinner drinks.
Lovely views from the bar area and we found the service quite good.
I did find the prices extremely high-$140 SD for a bottle of champagne-but was assured by our son ,this is Singapore!

I like most of the pasta there and the chocolate banana cake ... Nice place for weekend brunch too. Easy parking too...

This is a restaurant on the top (Sixth) floor of the National Gallery of Singapore. You have two good restaurants to choose from with outdoor seating also available. They serve great food and the chef will make a great vegetarian meal too

Got to start with a drink on the upper floor with a stunning view!
Food and service OK
Good wine selection
Atmosphere fine

We had dinner after a team event.Food is Italian inspired and good - without being anything out of the ordinary. However portions are small and though service is good and friendly it takes way too much time between the dishes. This is not a gourmet place and can therefore not take the liberty of slow serving and tiny portions.Anyway, it was a good evening and both wine and food was enjoyed. If you want to dine ag a great location - go, but no need to go out of the way for the food
2
But that's about it. Food is not bad, just average and the gap up to the premium price paid cannot be justified by the view. The service was unorganised with more than half an hours waiting between starter and main. Some good and sweet personalities among the waitresses but it seemed like they could really need a qualified manager to organise their work. The restaurant was half full on a Friday night and my guess is that it will close within a years time
5
I walked around Singapore after living here for 3 years, enjoying the sites for the last time. Walked up the gorgeous national gallery and stopped in the fancy restaurant Aura for lunch. Was underdressed since I was riding a rental bike around, but they let me in. Yummy lunch buffet with amazing 180 degree view of the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands
2
Went there for dinner on a Friday night. It was quite early when we got there and only table was occupied. Even then, it took quite a while for us to get seated. The service felt rushed. The moment we sat down, the wait staff immediately asked us what we wanted to drink even though we did not even have a chance to look at the drinks menu. However, after we placed our orders, it became difficult to get the attention of the staff who appeared to be more interested in having small talk among themselves or tapping away on their phones

Aura, a swanky concept by Il Lido group, a renowned F&B group focused on delivering quality dining experience. Located in the newly minted National Gallery Singapore, Aura occupied 2 two storey. The 5th floor focus on delivering Italian contemporary dining experience, while the 6th floor will be Sky Lounge, a place where you can chill out with the view of Singapore landmark. This time around we visited the Italian contemporary dining. The décor of the restaurant is classy and elegant. Once you entered the restaurant you can see the combination of dark wood tables with orange leather chairs, and the bar in the background with extensive bottle of wines range on display. Marble are used as divider in some part of the seating area. Dinner tonight was a special gathering with fellow foodies, definitely there are a lot of food going around. First to arrive after we place our order is the Focaccia with olive bits. The warm focaccia has a nice crisp texture on the crust, with soft internal part of the bread. The olive bits on top really does wander to enhance the flavour of the bread. There is some olive with balsamic vinegar on the side to dip your bread with if needed. Starters was shared by the group. Burrata Cheese with Cherry Tomatoes & Black Olives ($26). One of my all time favourite entrée. The cherry tomatoes provide the sweetness, arugula salad for a touch of bitterness. The creamy burrata cheese topped with bits of black olives with olive oil dressing really binds this dish together. Delicate and yet full of flavours. Parma Ham with Musk Melon ($26). This dish is presented like a flower bouquet on a plate. The arugula salads and ham as the base, while the thinly sliced musk melon was rolled like a flower.The parma ham is addictive like always, moist and slightly salty. The pale colour melon did not really contribute much in terms of flavour as it only has a subtle sweetness to it. It was easily overpowered by the parma ham, you will not miss it if it's not there. I still prefer my parma ham with bright orange rock melon. Grilled Octopus with Crispy Egg and Corn ($28). One of the smaller serving appetizer. The well grilled octopus and corn made a good combination texture and flavour. Springy & succulent with sweet & crunchy. The creaminess from the egg yolk and mash potatoes added the wow factor to the already yummy dish. A must try starter here, though I wish the portion is slightly bigger. Scallops Crudo with Truffle and Smoked Quail Eggs ($28). This looks more like a Japanese carpaccio dish instead of Italian. The scallops is served au natural, using citrus and vinegar dressing enhance the natural sweetness of the scallops. The salmon roe added the mini burst of brainy saltiness, while the truffle oil added to the aroma of the dish. It looks rustic and complicated, but the ingredients just speak for itself. Yummy. The most recommend dishes in Aura are their pasta range. The service staff will clearly highlighted this to you and featured heavily on their special menu. With that, I decided to try their Whole Wheat Tagliatelle With Duck & Foie Gras ($32). From the first bite, you can taste the difference between fresh pasta and dried pasta. The flat and thick later of pasta has a natural soft springiness to it. The tagliatelle did well to absorb the bold, robust and rich duck gravy and made gorgeous pairing with the smooth and velvety cubed foie gras. Yum Yum, it is indeed a must try dish. I also sample Tagliolini with Scampi and Avruga Caviar ($38) from a fellow foodies. Tagliolini is thinly cut and springy pasta commonly used for a lighter type of sauce. In this dish, scampi and caviar are used together combine with the richness from the butter. Watch out for the touch of shredded chilli, in which give a nice twist to the dish. For sweet ending of the meal, we had Tiramisu ($15) and Bailey's & Hazelnut Feuillentine ($15). Unlike the traditional Tiramisu, I personally like the new touch to it. Light and creamy cream, with sponge cake base in between. The taste of coffee liquor, chocolate are nicely balanced, topped off with crunchy chocolate balls. Love it. Meanwhile Bailey's & Hazelnut Feuillentine deliver a rich chocolate ending to the meal. It really taste like a Nutella dessert. I realised the Bailey's actually almost non-existent in this dessert. It can do with a couple more berries on the side, to counter the richness in this desserts. From the service point of view, the service staff was great. He was entertaining me with list of today's special while I was waiting for the rest of the guest to come. He was friendly, accommodating, not intrusive, know the food menu inside out. Wine recommendation was handled by the sommelier, which was very knowledgable and professional throughout the entire process. Overall, Aura is definitely a place to try for Italian Contemporary dining experience. I personally recommended the Scallops Crudo, Grilled Octopus, the Pastas and Tiramisu. It will create a dent on the wallet, but definitely worth the experience. Looking forward to the next visit in their Sky Lounge. Saluti!! Cheers!

Upon arrival, no service for menu and couldn't get anyone for water. My friend had to go up to the counter and request for service which was received with cold shrug from staff, when there were 5 of them standing around chatting. Ordered set dinner, selection of 1 of 2 appetizer, side and main, with dessert and ended with coffee at $88++. Food was tasty, tenderloin wasn't the best cut and tad salty. Rest was good & pretty presentation. I probably go back for drinks and sit outdoors for the stunning Singapore skyline.
4
Fine Italian cuisine with an interesting menu and very good and fast service. Prices are reasonable and their set lunch is good and affordable. In the evening, having a drink on the terrace overlooking Padang is a great option.
3
i was looking forward to try a new Italian place at National Gallery I've heard so much about. Unfortunately the experience was rather disappointing. We decided to go for a la carte instead of set in order to try the real Aura. Neither starters (we shared a few) nor pastas impressed us. The ambiance was so-so as there is no view from the restaurant and the only window was totally wet due to condensation. Overall unfortunately Aura is not the place I would ever come back
5
This is at the top floor of the National Gallery Singapore. It is best to visit around sun setting time. You can enjoy an amazing view of the island front. If you have time, stay till late and you get to enjoy a light show put up by Marina Bay Sands
3
We had decided to eat here last minute, it was hard to find due to the closer of some roads for the granprix. We first went to the Aura Skyline thinking we had booked there, i wish we would have just asked for a table in this restaurant as the views were amazing. The food was OK nothing special good price, but the ambiance was flat. Really no one else in there so you order and eat straight away. Only good thing, they were OK with us taking our bottle of wine to the skyline bar. My husband thought the portions were on the small side, He ate half mine! some times the atmosphere counts for a lot.
4
It was my first time at Aura National Gallery. Was there before for some work trip and events, but never to dine there. Aura is pleasantly located at level 5 of National Gallery, home of the local law heritage as well as home to some of the established and renown restaurants in Singapore. The 3 course set lunch is affordable and value for money, a place to impress your business partner or client both with the ambience as well as their cuisine. I had their Scallops Crudo with Truffle and Smoked Quail Eggs to start, followed by Chilean Seabass with Chanterelles and Confit Tomatoes and Baileys & Hazelnut Feuillantine to end. I must say there was a little something to impress me in each of the dishes and am looking forward to being back already
4
I went there for dinner and instead a good place to hang out. However the restaurant consider slightly high end so things will be more expensive. My dining experience overall is very good. Good food overall including Desserts. They have homemade pasta and that is quite delicious. There is also a very nice bar at level 6 which faced the great view. A prefect place for drinking.
4
Just moved to Singapore and very eager to try different Restaurants, Aura was on top of the list to try out. Especially since we where looking for a romantic evening out and wanted to opt for Italian food. First we went to the bar with a picture perfect view of the Marina bay part of the city. We saw the laser show from the marina bay sands hotel building and that was cool while sipping a cocktail. However my Mojito was not the best.. it was ok.Then we went to the dining room. The food was excellent!!! and timing for it to come to the table as well. Having said that the dining room is modern classic. It could be just a dining room anywhere in the world. It definitely is lacking a WOW factor. Where ever you sit, the aircon is blowing on you, so much that we moved to one of the two tables in the middle without it. That was a good move..As much as we enjoyed the food we will not go back to the restaurant because of the ambience. We both decided we would not go there to celebrate something.For us it is a tick on the bucket list.Go there for the view of the bar and then good italian food
3
Went in for dinner with friends. Was recommended and thought if giving it a try. Was very noisy and busy. Dimly lit but had a nice arrangement and feel in the restaurant. 2 of us ordered pasta with crab meat. We hv tasted better. Was a bit over done in all honesty. Spouse said his steak was avearage. The other friend had pasta with clams. He too said pasta was over cooked. Cant say we will go back because we have had better else where

Took my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner. I was expecting great things considering all the rave reviews and hype around Aura. I've never been more wrong in my life. Made a reservation at 8pm, wanted to get a table at the sky lounge for the view. I was late by 20mins and the manner by which I was approached made me feel like I showed up late for class. The experience was mainly tarnished by what I assumed was the manager of the restaurant. Local Singaporean lady in high heels. She told me that they usually cancel reservations after 30mins (it was 8.20pm), said the outside seating was full due to late reservations (the place was empty), and spoke like I had just interrupted her alone time of starring at the view.She was extremely curt and non-hospitable. Never asked us how our food was or smiled even once. To give her the benefit of the doubt, I thought ok maybe that's just her character. Not long after, I see her ushering a more mature looking customer would appear to have deeper pockets then me. Miraculously, I observed a more friendly, hospitable side of her and all of a sudden she's giving service with a smile. Wow. The only saving grace was the poor (russian?) waitress who was covering the outdoor seating. I also don't understand why there was only one server covering the outdoors and 4 servers indoors when 90% of the customers were seated outdoors. The servers indoors were standing around pretending to look busy.She made the whole experience bearable. I wanted to cut a birthday cake there but because of the lady in high heels and the lack of service, I took my cake somewhere else.I'll also be having my drinks only at smoke and mirrors if I ever go to NG. Shame.View 10/10Service 2/10Local lady in high heels -1/1

We have been to Aura a couple of times at night for drinks. Ambience is lovely, and so are the drinks and the service. The most amazing thing about the place is the spectacular view of the Singapore skyline. Nice place to chill out for after dinner drink
4
The food and service here is nothing to rave about however its a nice place to chill out with friends on the outdoor deck that offers unfettered views of Singapore's CBD skyline and across the Padang to the Marina Bay Sands hotel district.
5
Wonderful and helpful staff in a beautiful setting - food was fabulous, in particular the pasta. A must try!
3
This place has a great view and would be great during dinner. During F1, this would be THE place to be.
Food is just average.
5
A must if you like skylines!!!My sister (14) and I went to the national gallery and decided everyone should look at art in their own pace and that we would meet eachother at the rooftop bar after like three hours. When we bought the tickets they had mentioned the bar.After three hours I was exhausted. I hadn't realized the bar had such a great view!!! It was the best surprise!!!It wasn't crowded so that was even better.Here's the best part: you can see both skylines and in the middle the marina bay, it's the perfect view and i can imagine not too many people/tourists know about it... The drinks are a bit more expensive, but the view is worth it.I felt a little out of place because i was in my "exploring the city clothes", which are very casual and laid back - wasn't too much of a problem, they let me sit down ;-) To feel a bit more comfortable, maybe don't dress like me. ;-PI think the view and the atmosphere is nicer than in the ce la vie bar in the marina bay sands hotel, but that's just my taste
4
I had dinner with friends last night at the Aura. Food was just excellent with a lot of attention to the details. Fantastic seating area with modern fusion design. The staff is really looking after customers with tailored made service! Good value for money. To make that restaurant perfect I would advise them two things:1. The pan fried foie gras should be served with some bread or at least the portion should not be thick as it was2. The service is slow so you need to ask to get things rather than them anticipating what you need.I would recommend this restaurant
5
We had our dinner at first level of Aura. Their people service us promptly and I had a well cooked sea bass. The ambience was fantastic. Going to the bar on the second level, the view so amazing and romantic. Totally immersed in the great moment with the orange warm light all over. It's a great place to date! Cheers
2
We found a nice UOB promotion. A 50% discount on a 4-course dinner. After we were seated, we were presented with the a-la-carte menu. Upon our question about the 4-course deal, we were presented with a set dinner menu. We decided to order that.The service was hasty, cold (same as the temperature of te restaurant) with no personal touch. The food was mediocre. Trying to be topnotch but failed to impress.The biggest shock of the evening was the bill. No UOB discount! Reason given. We did not request for it! According to the manager, we should have mentioned it during our booking. How do we supposed to know?Shockingly the manager did not have a discussion! A 10% discount was finally given.Will never return
4
I organised a corporate dinner function recently. Ambience: If you are up at the skylounge or open decks, you will not be disappointed as you will be greeted by Singapore's wonderful cityscape. Down in the restaurant on the 5th floor, the setting is fine dining/ classy with the tables just spaced out enough that you do not feel that the restaurant is crowded.Service: Service is excellent by the Restaurant manager and waiting staff. Prompt and courteous.Food: I'll be objective here. Aura is not one of those Michelin star restaurants out there, but it stages itself well in Singapore's landscape of fine dining restaurants. Not one of the best, but decent. Detail/ creative plating, quality of the ingredients and the cook of the dish all fare decently. Couple that with the prices they charge, i'd say they remain competitive
4
Great new place in Singapore. Absolutely amazing views of the Padang and city skyline (better than from Marina Bay Sands and from here you can enjoy looking at Marina Bay Sands). Great place for a drink, watching the sun go down and on into the evening. Snacky food ok, but in my opinion, really the place for light food and drinks
4
The place offers great view of Singapore architectural landscapes. Nice terrace outside with great lighting. It's a good place for hangout after work and to have special occassion or celebration. The food plating looked very pretty, however taste just okay. The white fish I had taste good, although the chicken my colleague had was raw and need to be returned to their kitchen. The baileys chocolate cake was okay, taste good, but not that special. The services was good, very friendly and sensitive to the clients needs
3
Business dinner, nice location no view in the restaurant....sparse menu priced quite high for the quality of the food which was quite average, The wine list was over priced. Would not go back again
5
Half day tour to Singapore National Gallery followed with light and healthy buffet lunch at Aura Salad Bar ... With panoramic view ofMarina Bay Sand. Unforgettable.
5
It was a perfect choice for the birthday celebration. The view from the balcony was spectacular, the food was excellent and the service was faultless (Thank you, Paulo!).Though we were very tempted to go with the set dinner, we ordered dinner from the a la carte menu. To start with, the oysters from Normandy was recommended with the other starter being the grilled octopus, both were well received and delish! For the main course, we ordered the Porkchop Milanese and the Sirloin with grilled marrow salad which were truly outstanding dishes.Though we were both very full after the mains, we could not stop ourselves from finishing off the complimentary Birthday hazelnut gateau and the chocolate and banana cake. A very sweet gesture by the Management and brought to our table by a singing waitress!Their wine list is pretty adequate and the happy hour selection gives great value! All in all, a perfect meal
2
It was really a disappointment when I attended a dinner in April with over 100 pax at AURA. Contrary to all the hypes, the food quality of the main dishes was dismal. The seabass was dry and salted unevenly and so was the roast duck breast - dry and tough. Guests around me all had bad experience but they were too polite to feedback. If not for the company and the live band which was brought in separately, it would have been a very bad experience for all
5
I went to the Sky Lounge primarily to enjoy the view from atop the National Gallery. While there, I found the salad bar buffet, with a great selection of some 8 different vegetarian salads. Some of the staff were more friendly than others, but altogether a wonderful experience, having a delicious lunch, while enjoying the wide open view
5
I had my wedding solomization at Aura. The team behind this restaurant is truly phenomenal. They have organised quite a few weddings since they opened earlier this year, so they are very competent. All our needs were taken care of, including adapting the menu to suit the dietary needs of our guests, some of which had very specific and deviated from the standard menu.The menu itself is truly amazing, a lot of a la carte items were on the set menu, which is great. The food was literally perfection, with lots of attention given to flavours and presentation.The head waiter and his team were awesome. They didn't leave us wanting for anything and we did't have to ask for anything - this is what high-end service is. They even helped us carry our wedding pressents downstairs straight to our taxi. We and our guests had such a great time there that we didn't leave until 6pm - three hours after their lunch service ended. They didn't complain or try to push us out. Lastly, you get one of the best views in Singapore. What's not to like? I really can't understand some of the negative reviews on here. Well done team Aura, my husband and I can't wait to come back
4
Great cool bar Resto combination where the view is just fantastic , it's the same view of Sing CBD and MBS but different. Service , food and drinks all good and you won't be disappointed at all . In the old Supreme Court building which they have made into a national gallery !. Enjoy i

It has been a while since I have been out on a fancy meal with a gorgeous friend. We decided to splash it up to celebrate decades of friendship. So I picked Aura as I had not been to the place. Most of my friends were raving about the awesome view from the bar with a stunning vista of Singapore. The service began with a good recommendation from our Slovakian's waitress who was chatty, friendly and was able to sort logistics of our moving from bar to restaurant. The restaurant does get noisy as it's popular with couples or large groups of business folks entertaining guests. We decided to do a share of starters. Tuna Tartare with Avocado and Grilled Zucchini and Foie Gras with Caramelised Apple and Duck Jus. I know. I know. Foie Gras. Bad.. not protecting the environment and the poor geese. Well, look, I succumbed to by basic instincts. I am sure I will pay the price for it. For mains I had Spring Lamb Chopswith Eggplant and Fresh Herb Salad. I will tell you. The lamp was absolutely fantastic. It was perfect, the right texture and the meat was just perfect to bite into. A must do dish in my opinion. We had a good wine to go along with the dinner. Finally for dessert, the helpful server recommended, Amedei Chocolate & Banana Cake. As I am not a big fan of chocolates, my date was definitely into it and she went to town on it. I had a bite and nearly hit the roof as it was definitely worth that one bit
5
Looking to do brunch? Want somewhere with spectacular views of Singapore? Aura is the place to go. The Italian themed buffet had a large range of seafood, charcuterie and cheeses along with some pasta and meat dishes. All the food was amazing, the service excellent and the view spectacular
5
I went to Aura with a bunch of colleagues for lunch. The ambience is lovely, all muted shades and dim lights. I picked the set lunch menu at SGD38. A lovely soup, pasta, dessert and coffee. All served with great attention to details and courteous service. The portions were just right, not too little, not too much. I highly recommend Aura
4
We had a beautiful meal, the appetisers were outstanding. Staff were professional and passionate. Really enjoyable and highly recommend it.
2
Food was good, but the restaurant is way to congested, and the personel is trying to be funny, but better don't. Overall chaotic, there are better places
2
In several occasions I have eaten at Aura. Though the location and ambience is exquisite, the food is less than OK and the service is definitely not OK especially when you are in a big group. The menu sounds promising and delicious, but the food is bland. Don't expect too much looking at the atmosphere
4
I love this restaurant. Wonderful friendly service, great view at the rooftop, delicious food, and good value for money. I love the restaurant's ambiance and it's great for a romantic night out or just to hang out with friends. It is less crowded at lunch so it's good as a quiet lunch venue

Hello, I am writing in regards to my dinner experience for 6 people on Saturday 18th of June. I had made a reservation for my friends from overseas and myself to celebrate a birthday, and was hoping to show them a great dining experience in Singapore, however it was truly awful. I have never been so embarrassed as a Singaporean to take my friends to such a rude restaurant. The male waitstaff in particular was exceptionally insolent, and claimed a bottle of wine will ONLY serve 5 people, and ‘forgot’ to serve the last person. Now, I know in practice restaurants do not serve a “standard drink” and usually pour more, it would have been much appreciated if he had split the bottle between 6 and then graciously offered the menu to order another bottle if requested. Instead he joked that we should be careful that he does not “double charge” the second bottle instead. What I feel is a truly inappropriate comment to make. Other comments I have on the service: • simply dumping dishes down on the table haphazardly is not a mark of an “elegant” restaurant,• ‘forgetting’ the bread after pouring the olive oil and balsamic vinegar and ungraciously dumping it on the table when requested• not refilling our wineglasses when there was at least half a bottle of wine on the serving table until requested (I had an empty wineglass for all of my main course)• not refilling water until requestedI believe if the restaurant is short on staff at least leave the wine bottle on the table – we as guests are more than happy to pour for ourselves if staff are overwhelmed. However I do not feel that this was the case as I noticed many times during the night the staff taking time to check their phones. I would like to however commend the back of house staff and chefs as the food served was truly delicious, however I will never return and make sure to never recommend this establishment to anyone. Definitely stay away, this was the worst “world class contemporary dining experience” that I have ever encountered
1
I went to aura, I ordered drinks and the waiter taking my drinks had no personality and made my night, (what could have been all night into a one drink event). When I asked for the check the server had an attitude like I was bothering her. Overall the bar/restaurant has so sort of hospitality..
3
We were here for dinner to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. Had to make a prior reservation and the place was quickly packed. The main crowd were businessmen and foreigners. Food pricing for the appetizer, main course and dessert was around 20-30, 40-60 and 20-30 respectively. Wine selection was pretty extensive and were mostly from the luxurious range. The pasta wasn't as good compared with the mains. Would recommend trying the foie gras or the lamb which were both definitely much better than the steak. Appetisers were good, and can be shared if in a Group. Quality of food wasn't that great for the price though, although the presentation set it slightly apart.Service was pretty strange. Waiter told many weird jokes throughout the dinner. And it was strange that the waiter couldn't recognise a margarita. Instead, giving us a manhattan drink instead, and insisting that was the way a margarita was made at this restaurant. A letdown was perhaps for dessert, the waiter was so insistent for my girl friend to get the tiramisu cake rather than other deserts, so that they could charge for it, while using it as a make-do birthday cake. Overall, would feel that this place is slightly snobbish and biased towards the high society or people dressed in suits. If you're intending to get good service, better signal your intention to leave a big tip earlier

We organised a farewell party for a friend yesterday and had the weekend lunch at Aura. Apart from the delicious menu, we received attentive service from Push and he really makes a difference whenever I get a chance to dine there. We were a group of 16 and everyone was impressed by the service. The $98 prosecco free flow with food is one of the best deal in town too
4
Went there yesterday for business dinner and had the strongly recommended Sea Urchin Pasta. Rich yet not overbearing, quite impressed with the fusion between italian pasta and uni sashimi. Will definitely go back and have it again. Also had the burrata cheese for appetizer. Fresh and reasonably priced. The home made bread that was served was warm and soft. Very nice.Service was also attentive.They have a wide selection of wine
2
The potential is amazing, with great views, sadly this pretentious restaurant fails to deliver on a great many counts. Firstly the waiters spend their time on their phones connecting to the kitchen, which gives the appearance that they are more concerned with their SMS action than they are the guests. We had to wait more than 45 minutes between our first and main course being served. We were cheekily told this is because the food is cooked fresh. At these prices it is a requirement that this food is cooked fresh.Menu is limited. I started with beef wagyu carpaccio which was tasteless. My pasta when it arrived was overcooked but ok. My partners shrimp pasta was disgusting. he bravely ate his way through half and regretted it later as he spent the rest of the night throwing up.The manager came to the table to see us after I had said the experience was average. He was rather indignant rather than apologetic, but sent free grappa to the table.Too Little too late. In a competitive environment like Singapore you cannot insult your guests with such mediocre service and food. Unless of course you don't care and your main market is tourists who in any case will not return.Speaking with friends they have commented that their experience was underwhelming too. Don't bother going here, there are thousands of better establishments to chose from in this city
4
Food is not half bad , nice decor that lifts one's spirits , kudos to the friendly & eager-to-please service , convenient location. Sky lounge a bonus to a great romantic night out. Might get a little noisy when big groups are present.
3
This is a great place to have a drink with the views out over the cricket club and the city. But unfortunately there aren't any fans outside, and so if you arrive before 7pm you should expect to get very hot and sweaty quite quickly. Service is efficient and friendly but it's just too hot to enjoy it properly

I flew from Bangkok for the day to have lunch with two friends. I had not seen the newly completed revival of the historic government buildings in Singapore coupled with galleries and public gathering facilities. Apart from enjoying the architecture, we had a wonderful meal at Aura. My host is well known to the chef and most of the staff. We sat down and he gave a few guidelines and the chef then took it over. The guidelines were one no meat and two meat. There you have it. The food was creative, delicate and wonderful . We had a crab pasta that was revolutionary. The setting, the camaraderie and the food made it a most wonderful experience. Well worth a day trip from Bangkok for lunch

Fabulous decor and design with great bar upstairs with fantastic view of Padang and Marina Bay. Renovated National Gallery is worth a look.This restaurant fits in with the typical high end dining syndrome in Singapore. 'Artisanal' food at inflated prices. Food to be admired on arrival but disappointing in the eating. Style over substance. Average wine at same inflated prices with no imagination in the selection.On ordering waiter (who was very attentive and personable) I asked if he thought I had enough food. Response was pork chop was actually six chops (was one small chop in six pieces) and i didn't need a pasta.Asked which French white would he recommend, was recommended a Sancerre as 'good drinking'. Good drinking? That's the way my Mother describes wine.It was all ok but after spending a few hundred bucks for 2 people was disappointed

We went here for lunch and were lucky to get a seat without a reservation as the place was packed. The staff was extremely friendly to move around some furniture for our stroller with sleeping baby. Aura has a really good ambiance and although the main crowd were businessmen and expat wives no-one would feel out of place here.Now the disappointing part... The quality of the food really didn't match the standard of the rest of the establishment. The food is not bad but just very average and uninspiring.

We only tried the Roof top for lunch. They have a 21 dollars buffet ex desserts ex drinks consisting in fifteen choices of Mediterranean / Italian type of salads . Not bad, not great either , just average tasting frankly. Service is friendly but everything looks a bit " on the cheap " . I would not take a client there for sure, but it's a good place for its amazing views ! I think that this us a good deal for tourists . Pay 21 bucks for the buffet and enjoy the view !

This is a new restaurant in the recently opened National Gallery Museum. We went there for Sunday lunch and had the fix price lunch menu. The starter was shared amongst the entire table including the fantastic Tofie in pesto sauce and the crab pasta. This was followed the black cod with artichoke in uni sauce. This a a great combination brought out the sea freshness of the delicate cod. After the lunch we went upstairs to its roof top bar. Unfortunately that was closed but we managed to take some pictures of the iconic Marina Bay cityscape. A very delightful visit

While visiting the new gallery we stumbled upon this Italian restaurant on the roof top of the gallery for lunch. This is a high end Italian restaurant. Staff were friendly and accommodating even though we did not have a reservation. They were very busy. They have a good menu of Italian specialties and some with a twist.
4
We went to Aura at around 5pm on a somewhat gloomy day. However, it was worth a visit during our short, two day trip to Singapore to get a view of the various kinds of architecture in the area. We also enjoyed a very overpriced drink whilst seated outside and the sliders were delicious! As it was relatively early, it wasnâ€™t too busy and our waitress was wonderful! We will be back next time to explore more of the Gallery and to catch the sunset from here

It is highly popular but I doubt it will continue to be if they do not pay more attention to the quality of food and service.We had early dinner and it wasn't packed but the service wasn't attentive enough. The waiter seemed lost, never made eye contact or smile. We waited for a while for the wine list after seating and it became clear that he wasn't aware that we were waiting.. So we had to ask. And when our drinks have finished we had to "catch" the waiter again and waited again for a while, we didn't even receive our wine at the same time. Same thing for water, for the next course, for everything it seems.. we had to catch, ask and inform the waiter every time.Food- olive oil and vinegar on the table are of poor quality. Having a reputation as an Italian restaurant I would imagine it is more than necessary to have nice quality Italian evoo, green, fruity, early harvest, bitter, or anything with some character. The same for vinegar, I would think they provide nice quality balsamico with certain density - Octopus with eggs.. Hmm doesn't taste well together - Oxtail / mushroom pappardelle was so so, not something you will expect from reputable Italian establishment - Grass fed sirloin and bone marrow were under seasoned, salad on the side was dead looking. Not fresh enough, no taste of vinaigrette - Lamb rack was the only plate we enjoyed but the same with salad on the side. I thought they are doing salad bar buffet for lunch everyday, I would assume that having freshest salad will be their priority?- Dessert was disaster. I think the choux are frozen ready to serve and for the tiramisu I would expect something more from a famous Italian restaurant. No one informed that we could opt to have desserts and drinks on the rooftop after dinnerWe paid nearly SGD300 and were not satisfied with the dinner, I would have expected better quality food and more attentive service

We went for drinks on the balcony the view is stunning it is absolutely worth it just for that. However did find difficulty in tasting the gin in my G&T had to go for a double second time around but the view....

Made reservation here two weeks ago. Good menu offered, had scallops, white asparagus with Parma ham, uni with pasta and Wagyu beef. Good service by serving staff. Recommend to future visits
4
Came here many times both on 5th floor and 6th floor to wow my out of town guests. The food is not great, but you come here for the ambience and views. If they improve on the food standards then this place will have potential to be a truly 5-stars establishment given its unique location.
4
When you call for reservations, request to be seated at the top floor/deck as that is where you have a great view of Marina Bay Sands. The food was great and served all in a very timely manner. We enjoyed the Scallops Crudo with Truffle and Smoked Quail Eggs and Whole Wheat Tagliatelle with Duck & Foie Gras -- I would definitely recommend these two dishes to anyone that visits aura.

This restaurant has a spectacular view of the Marina Bay! Aura has 2 floors, the top being a more chill out restaurant while the lower floor is more refined. The upper floors serves Italian cuisine and turns into a rooftop bar in the evenings. I love the pasta they serve here, it’s really a masterclass in refined dining
2
My husband and I tried making reservations at Aura several times but it was always booked. Finally, we got a table early in the evening and anticipated a wonderful experience. My husband chose 3-courses and I had 2. Unfortunately, of the 5 total dishes, neither of us liked any of them. The most disappointing dish was the Ragu. It tasted as if they added sugar to it. It was too sweet. We ended up adding salt & pepper to all of our dishes in hopes of changing the flavour. It was an expensive meal and we left disappointed

My sentiments regarding restaurants or cafes located in popular tourist spots around the world come as a mixed bag, or shall I say, usually hit and miss.Aura, a very mod Italian restaurant by the affable restaurateur Beppi di Vito, strikes the right chord in an already saturated Italian restaurant market in Singapore. He does things right.With a menu to salivate to, and an impeccable wine book, Aura simply has to be on your list of things to do while dipping into the best of Southeast Asian art at the National Gallery of Singapore. My Cured Veal was perfect with the Tuna Sauce & Capers to start; then for my main was the Spaghetti with Scallops and Asparagus - al dente, the scallops bouncy and juicy with green perfectly cooked asparagus. I had a Coffee & Chocolate Cake to end the meal, and I was ready to start off bouncing around the art all over again after my espresso dopio!For lunch, munch or dinner, please don't forget to go upstairs to the Sky Lounge above that has the best views, bar none, of The Padang, fronted by Moshe Safdie’s Marina Bay Sands. All bearing silent witness to the new and powerful skyline of Singapore.Make sure you book ahead to ensure a good table or one with views at the Sky Lounge. You’ll be glad you did! Tell Beppi I sent you....

Celebrated a birthday here with family and a few cocktails. The view at night is incredible and the music makes for a laid-back ambience. The staff are friendly, drinks menu mainly consists of classics but the food is very lacking - heavily overpriced for its worth
1
Company event and we reserved an area for dinner and drinks for a small group 14. 1). The Assistant Manager who attended to us highly recommended pasta linguine to me when I wanted to make another choice. He was boasting about his recommendation and the clams were very special from europe etc etc and convinced me that I shouldn't choose what I choose. I should "trust him" as he is the Manager here. So I took his recommendation. He promised by saying, "if it is not tasty, I will not charge you for it." Yeah right. Look at the picture. (and no they didnt refund or change to another dish for me when I tasted it) A full plate of noodles and small tiny clams and the taste was not at all up to standard. It farrrrrr from Italian standards. I can cook Italian food myself as I like Italian food alot and when you come to such a restaurant, you expect basic italian standards. The food was no good. Two of my colleagues tried mine. They gave me disapproving looks and said, "that guy was trying so hard to convince you probably because they were trying to clear their stocks - unsold clams. This is not even good."I had three bites and feedbacked that the food was no good. Instead of asking me to change to another dish, the waiter just cleared the dish for me which obviously was still in full plate. I told the Asst Manager it was no good, he told me linguine taste like this. Err. hello? Do you think this is my first time having this dish and know nothing about Italian food? Oh. TIPS....2) The same guy (Assistant Manager) came to me in the middle of dinner and told me that in US everyone tip. So I should tip too when I come to such a place. I was taken aback and told him I carry no cash. I told him I will tip on card when paying. He then asked to tip in CASH and only CASH! He want hard cash not via card payment despite I told him I carry no cash. He said the tip will be split with another waiter and I should tip...He looked at my boss, and requested that I go to my boss to collect CASH of 200. Or ask those who has the cash.This is unbelievable. My boss and his wife were there and my colleagues saw what happened and started to help me out. When he saw that my colleagues were beginning to ask questions.He tone down his voice and said he would see what he can do to let me tip him. Okay. That is what he did. Upon leaving, he made sure I tip him on my credit card pointed at the recipt where I should tip (which initially he insisted on just cash).BEST PART. He told me I "owned" him a good review on trip advisor! And I have to include his name when complimenting! Yeah. Shocking. I paid for this bad experience bad food and now I own him?Wow. What a place.I called and went to the restaurant "twice" to find the owner as I wanted to feedback how wrong this is. But I was either told that he is not in or someone else (Senior)Op. Manager will be attending to me. The Op Manager seems reluctant to let me meet him in person when I was trying to fix an appointment with him for feedback. This explains why I am only writing now when it happens in late Jan. I wanted to tell the owner face to face.I was thinking perhaps they are function like this together, soliciting tips from customers without the owner's knowledge hence I didn't want to deal with any of them!Overall, Terrible service. Very unprofessional. Reminds me of those people at Sim lim square who over sells with their aggresive sales tactics.Yes place was romantic beautiful. Beef pieces feedback was okay. Their vegetarian food was very bad. Vegetarian, do not have high expectations. Overall food rating: Not up to Italians food standard. Scallops so so. Alot of presentation but really lacks of real skill! Real food good talian taste

WOW! This new venue along the Padang is simply amazing - the renovation and transformation of these two historical buildings simply just sets the tone and lifts the bar for restaurant and bar scenes in the region - and on top of this amazing setting is Aura situated. The destination deserves to get the main credit here because its one of those settings that regardless of what you experience - you will be back. That said, and with all respect to Aura - they have a very nice restaurant with a contemporary Italian menu - nice drink packages with various versions of free flow combinations.The area of improvements are staff attentiveness. For some reasons the management of this establishment allows all staff to carry around their smartphone - which most of them found much more interesting than their paying patrons - which was more than enjoying - simply distracting. Will be back - but they have to improve staff attitude to survive once the fame of the destinations settles

we had brunch in a group of 8 and there was free flow champagne for 128++, we definitely had our fair share of drinks. the food however was a bit of let down, limited choice and the execution was mediocre at best.
2
Went during a weekday for lunch, the restaurant was packed. The setting is good but a little noisy. Disappointed with the food and the coffee served was lukewarm. After we feedback about the coffee, they waived it off. Would not return for its food again.
3
I had dinner here with a girlfriend on Saturday night. The restaurant was very busy and we couldn't get a reservation - only called on Saturday afternoon though - but they managed to squeeze us in at 8.30pm. It's a nice place for 2 ladies to catch up and the bar serves good cocktails at about $20 each.I was very disappointed with the food. I had the Burrata Cheese with Cherry Tomatoes & Black Olives to start - it was not tasty and it was not seasoned (i.e. with olive oil, salt and pepper). I understand that the restaurant may have done this deliberately so that dinners could season to taste but salt and pepper should be provided on the table without us having to ask. For mains I had the Tagliatelle with Duck & Foie Gras - the duck was minced (which was a little strange) and even having 3 pieces of foie gras with the serving couldn't elevate the unimpressive flavour of the dish. I wouldn't order either dish again. For dessert I had the Baileys & Hazelnut Feuillantine which was very delicious and something I would order again. It doesn't taste too alcoholic and the tartness of the raspberry coulis goes well with the feuillantine.Overall an alright experience. Good ambience, nice bar for before / after dinner cocktails but the food is average, unoriginal and lacks flavour
5
Contrary to other reviewers, I personally find that the pricing offered by Aura for the drinks very reasonable and affordable. The cocktails are going at 14- 18 SGD a glass and some bottles ( like prosecco ) is only 60 SGD. What's more, on weekdays they have promotion Happy Hour from 5-8pm. I would think for the view and ambience, it was rather worth it. Their staff are also very attentive and will automatically serve us ice water when we finished our drinks.Unfortunately, I did not managed to get a taste of the food and finger food
4
Nice cosy Italian place, beautiful decor but the mood is casual and relaxed. Welcoming for all. Food was great. Ordered beef, lamb and pork mains...all well done. The starters were also great. Price is OK....not too over the top. Only thing is perhaps they have a bit of manpower shortage but overall they try. Was my bday (they didnt ask me anything though despite my indication in the reservation)...anyway went up to the sky lounge for dessert and drinks. Wonderful atmosphere! Nice city skyline and lights.the service at the lounge is good. this place is nice for special occasions.
4
This isn't your typical Sunday buffet brunch. Instead, they serve you with a variety of shared starters which for us included two pastas (which were outstanding), crab bruschetta, tomato and mozzarella bruschetta, charcuterie plate, squid and a few other dishes. You then chose a main course (all of which were nice, but very small servings) and a dessert. With the free flow house Prosecco, it's a lovely afternoon with friends. Service was a bit hit and miss. Head upstairs to the rooftop bar afterwards and take in the views of Singapore as you sip on a digestive after indulging in brunch
3
I was here on a Saturday with some friends. The food was delicious and well presented, and the interior of the restaurant was beautifully designed - an overall pleasant place for a weekend lunch. The octopus and burrata appetizers were tasty, and so were the smoked duck with foie gras and the tagliatelle mains. While the service at Aura was not by any means fantastic, it was not for want of trying and harsher comments directed at the staff by other TripAdvisor patrons sound, in my opinion, exaggerated. However, I do think management should be aware that if Aura is pricing themselves at the higher end of the spectrum, patrons should be entitled to expect a little more polish from their overall experience
3
Went with friends to celebrate a birthday. The food was good all around but nothing special and certainly not for the price point. They probably pay a lot for the location so they have to recover it. Starters included burrata cheese, bruschetta, scallops, etc. The pasta mains were quite heavy and creamy. My lamb chops were average. Second visit here and probably my last.
3
The restaurant was surprisingly packed on a Sunday night! Went for dinner with a friend and the setting was perfect. Servers were attentive without being annoying. Whilst the food wasn't totally fantastic, it wasn't too bad either. Would definitely come back when I am looking for a quiet and intimate place to wine and dine at
3
The view from the balcony at Aura is really special, but the drinks and bar snacks we ordered left a lot to be desired... Admittedly it was busy when we were there, getting a servers attention was hard. I would go back and give it another go.
2
Very rich food and it seemed every dish came with cream dressing. The decor is nice. Clearly a court favourite for lawyers lunching between hearings. I wouldn't seek it out
3
The view is great here, while the restaurant itself the food is only average. There are much better italian restaurants out there. For the view, can just go to the sky lounge for drinks and small bites and skip the restarurant.
4
I had a dinner there with friends, great view during the blue hour. You can see half the Singapore Skyline. Nice food (small portions) and a cool interior design make this restaurant a great place for a romantic dinner.
3
The photo shows the view from the deck on level six and it is indeed stunning and well worth a visit. The restaurant however is located on level five and has no views at all which was a disappointment.  We had to wait for another couple of a good twenty minutes and were offered water on arrival but not a drinks menu and it was not easy to catch the waiter's eye during that time. Our meal was good, not exceptional but good and the presentation was above average. We went up-stairs for dessert so as to enjoy the view and again found it was impossible to catch the waiter's attention. Overall, I feel the waiting staff let the restaurant down and with so much competition, we will be trying a different venue next time rather than returning
2
For a pricy restaurant, the food is really average. The portions are very small, and even though they made an effort to serve original dishes, the taste is not here. The room downstairs is also very noisy. I would definitely recommend to go for a drink and enjoy the amazing view, but definitely not for dinner
4
It's in a beautiful location on the 5th of the newly opened National Gallery which is a beautifully restored building. The chef is from the very popular Il Lido in Sentosa. The scallop tartare with sea urchin and salmon, grilled octopus with crispy egg and corn and Piemontese beef sirloin were superb but my personal favourite was the tagliolini with scampi and avruga caviar. Weather permitting, ask to have your coffee and desserts upstairs where the view is even more spectacular. Aura has a more casual diner on the upper floor that is definitely worth a visit. As expected, the tiramisu is delicious. Service was very attentive and knowledgeable which enhanced the meal.My one complaint would be the resonance in the restaurant- We had to literally be shouting to be heard.
3
Our evening cocktail was spoiled by a huge thunderstorm and we had to rush for cover, but not before we had snapped the great view. I think this might take over from my normal cocktail spot at the top of Marina Bay Sands! But for food the MBS restaurant (used to be Ku De Ta, now can't remember what its called) is much better. There were four of us so we shared starters - carpaccio of tuna, foie gras, and scallops, which were all good. My fish - red snapper - came on a grey mush and really didn't taste of much; my husband's fish, the cod was better, Ok he said; our friends seem satisfied with their pasta dishes. But overall I was underwhelmed for the price. Seems a bit fussy for good Italian good, trying to be high dining when not quite pulling it off. But 1 will be back for drinks
2
Went along for drinks with friends - fantastic view of the Cricket Club and Marina Bay but the evening spolit by poor service. Took ages to get served, drinks order wrong, no apology - the staff were generally disinterested and we left after one drink. Such a shame as the owners have obviously spent a great deal of money on this refurbishment and roof top bars are really on trend in Singapore at the moment but I don;t think we'll be back anytime soon.
3
Ate here with friends for lunch in Jan, my friend is very good at picking out great places for lunch/new places to try. The set lunch menu was excellent value with a decent selection, I particularly enjoyed the prosciutto salad starter as the ingredients were very generous, given that we all know the cost of Mediterranean produce here! Nice pasta linguine for main and for the price impressed that dessert and coffee are included too. Service a complete let down and a real shame. Not acceptable at all and there's no excuses, even if Singapore has a reputation for bad service, it needs to stop, I'm not sure why people put up with it. All we wanted to do was pay separately, could have swallowed and accepted a very gracious 'no' with any kind of apologetic response but anyone would think we'd asked to take home the china! Then, after being begrudgingly told 'yes', upon signing, my friend had the pen slung down at her. Disgraceful. The looks we were given were shocking! Maybe a 'silly' bunch of girls choosing the set lunch menu are not wanted but each 'silly girl' enjoys rather expensive meals too, shame for them that when my husband asked if we should go there for dinner I told him no way, we spent our $600 elsewhere that night, where the service is great.
5
Have been twice now and found the restaurant to have a pleasing ambience, good service, and good food both times. Weekday lunch included a set of Italian salads while our holiday (Chinese New Year) meal was their brunch. The food was well prepared with good quality ingredients. The view to the Padang, Marina Bay Sands, and the Esplanade is quite nice. They have outdoor seating but in the daytime it is in the sun and uncomfortably hot. Oh, the house wine is quite reasonably priced at $11 SGD. a good deal for Singapore
3
Lovely cafe with jazz, and a great view on Singapore. Brilliant way to get a pause in your visit of gallery. We only had drinks so no comment available on food.
Pity some of the staff have so much (misplaced?) attitude.
3
Following a busy Chinese New Year's Day we visited the new National Gallery of Singapore and had a lovely light lunch at Aura the restaurant on level 5.Firstly, the views over the Padang and the city skyline, Marina Bay and the cruise line marina were really nice. The food with a little Mediterranean flavour was served pretty quick, with the food served hot and the ingredients were fresh.While the wine list was not exhaustive there was still a range to choose from and I noticed a number of tables were celebrating with champagne.The food was tasty and I would go back again.We had a lovely time at the Gallery, and I could easily see this becoming a 'must do' for tourists.The Gallery itself is really wonderful and a great addition for Singapore. The restoration work on the City Hall and Supreme Court buildings is a highlight. I really enjoyed the paintings in the Supreme Court more.A great way to spend a Sunday afternoon

We were recently invited to lunch at the newly opened AURA Italian Restaurant at Singapore’s National Gallery, and we have to say… the ambience, service and food blew us away! Normally whenever we are in Singapore (which is often), we stay away from European establishments (Italian, French etc) and target local eateries and restaurants to entertain or just simply to dine. When we were invited to AURA, we were a bit sceptical as we have been to many Italian restaurants around the globe and wasn’t up for it, however, the scepticism soon diminished when we were greeted by a friendly face at the door and it got better. We were looked after (and very well too) by Alvin who was an amazing character and a very professional operator. He could have suggested everything on the menu and more, and we would have just ordered based on his recommendations. We selected the Geisen Sav Blanc but Alvin suggested a Californian Chenin Blanc which we agreed to, all in all making humorous comments in between with professional ease. If you dig Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris, then Chenin Blanc will suit your palate nicely… For entrée we ordered the grilled octopus, salad crudo and green salad with apple and truffle, all 3 entrees were magnificent, well balanced taste! For mains we had the seabass with artichokes, cod with basil and tomatoes and scallops with cheese and beetroot… again, magnificently presented and thoroughly enjoyable! Service by Alvin by this time went up another notch and he was “gently touting” the well composed desserts on offer, and yes, we could (again) have ordered everything based on Alvin’s recommendations. We ended up with a special dessert as it was the host’s birthday. Alvin offered Limon cello which is an all-time favourite Italian liquor of ours especially after a very nice, delicious, most appetising, good Italian spread and in Singapore of all places!! Service level is 5 out of 5, Food is 5 out of 5 and Ambience 5 out of 5. If it was dinner the ambience would have been 6 out of 5.Will definitely be back when next in Singapore. It appears that other service staff were also as poised yet bloody professional to the teeth, but we gather that is because they have been trained and supervised by Alvin before being “let loose”. Excellent management Team !

After a night at Aura for dinner and drinks I felt satisfied, happy and overall the night was great. First of all the view from the tables in the second floor dining area is amazing overlooking the marina bay and the skyline of CBD. Although the view is great, I have to highlight the food at this place. We tried some of the appetizers and the pasta for main course. The tuna tartar and grilled octopus starters were good, however the pasta dishes were the stars of the show. The Oxtail Pappardelle and the Burrata raviolli were just amazing, the taste gave me goosebumps! Given all the above, I have however chosen to give the restaurant 4 out of a possible 5 due to the following small issues: Given The price level of the place you can expect a lot. The waiter that we had was very kind and followed up on everything however some of the other staff that we experienced were apparently not very happy with their job looking miserable and not service minded at all. The only issue with our waiter was the lack of wine knowledge, which you should expect in a place like this. The starters were good, but could not defend their price tag. Overall a great experience, but 4 out of 5 due to some minor issues which can easily be fixed 
1
We stopped by Aura for brunch excited to dine at the new restaurant in The Singapore National Gallery (being the big foodies that we are). Oh boy were we disappointed - we weren't given a menu until 15 minutes later, half of our starters came 45 minutes after ordering and then the mains (we had scallop and steak) were luke warm (obviously had been sitting there for a while before it was brought out to us). The other half of our starters then came after our mains with no apology. I understand restaurants get very busy but this is probably the worst service we've ever experienced in Singapore
4
I had dinner here with friends and it was a special location with great ambience at the old Supreme Court building. The food is similar to Il Lido's usual Italian offerings - I would recommend the fish, scallops and homemade pasta, but the burrata appetiser could have been better (the cherry tomatoes were amazing though). Didn't get the chance to try dessert but would love to come back to do so. I would also like to commend Operations Manager Jody Adler for his excellent service and hospitality that evening
3
Restaurant - food quality was not consistent. One was good, another just merely satisfactory. Restaurant was very full & the noise level was high and both of us were straining to hear each other. We ended our meal without dessert to head to the sky lounge upstairs. Sky lounge - you can choose to sit indoors w the air-conditioning on a hot day or sit outside to enjoy the breeze at night , with a gorgeous view of the skyline. Music in the background, unblocked view before us, we enjoyed our dessert & drinks in peace. Completely different atmosphere.Art Gallery is a must. So recommend you hit the art gallery, then head up to Aura Sky lounge, you can skip the restaurant.
3
Aura and its Sky Lounge take pride of place on the fifth and sixth levels respectively of the historic old City Hall and Supreme Court Buildings that now make up the stunning new National Gallery Singapore.  Do start with a cocktail at the Sky Lounge - mine was a good gin martini (around $20) - to enjoy the 180-degree view across the Padang to the Esplanade Theatres by the Bay, the laser light show from Singapore's latest icon, the Marina Bay Sands, and beyond.  My friend and I had some excellent Italian bread before our cod with basil orbotto and cherry tomatoes ($38), its skin served separately as a crispy garnish; and lamb chops ($48), Australian, nicely pink but quite a bit gamier than they should have been. Portions being on the small side, there was plenty of room for a mango and coconut trifle. Service is pleasant and efficient, as you'd expect. Do go - if only for pre-dinner drinks
3
A group of us from the office decided to hot foot it over to Aura from Raffles Place for lunch. It was on the whole very enjoyable - the standard of food was good, the dining room benefited from natural light and an understated elegance. The only slight let down was the service (more on that later).What we ate - the starters of wagyu beef carpaccio and tuna tartare were delicious as was the linguini with clams and trofie with pesto and prawns. The only let down was the grilled octopus which was overdone. The profiteroles we had for desert were were nicely presented (side note - please could restaurants in Singapore move away from molten chocolate cakes as standard desert fare).Having read some of the other reviews, it would appear that the restaurant suffers from highly inconsistent service. A shame as the food is generally well executed and the place has a nice buzz that is great for a business lunch or a meet up with friends.In our case, the main courses were served before we had finished our starters. The waiter attempted a feeble excuse of wanting these dishes out to avoid a back log of orders. This is a huge misstep for a restaurant claiming to be at the top end. If we had clients with us, we would all be making mental notes not to return any time soon. For this reason, Aura falls short of a very good rating.

Situated near the heart of Singapore. The place offers a lovely view of Esplanade, Marina Bay, Singapore Flyer and town district. The food was great and staffs were nice. You have the option to take the indoor seats which is AC or you can dine outside for a lovely view. Best to go there before sunset
3
Went for dinner with friends. Cod was ok, seabream, ok too; in short not fantastic. It's the view that's pulling in the crowd.
3
Nice restaurant with good food, placing this restaurant in the National Gallery is a bit strange as it attracts a lot of people which do not match with the style of the restaurant. Restaurant wants to be chique but it's more like a brasserie
3
Menu looks quite exciting, however the food is fairly average for a restaurant of this standard. Ate the scallops to start followed by the sea bream. Good but not outstanding. However, the location and interior design is excellent. Service extremely slow at lunch.
2
Was invited for a luncheon where the entire 6th floor was booked out for a private event for lunch. I was much looking forward to this as Aura had been so well written up and reservations seemed difficult to get as of now. The view from the 6th floor was pretty amazing and other than the pain (this was my fault as it was not easy to locate given it was my 1st time there) in getting to the restaurant, it was definitely a fantastic start to the lunch. Lunch consisted of the below:1. Hokkaido Scallops Crudo with Truffle 2. Sunchoke Cream with Porcini Mushrooms3. Trofie Pasta with Scampi4. Black Cod with Saffron & Seasonal Veg5. Amedel Chocolate & Banana CakeService:Expectations were high. And rightly so. But given we were all seated in long tables (and there must have been 5 long tables). Please tell me how a restaurant like Aura with so many wait staff around (and trust me there were enough) could possibly miss serving Course 1 to two persons at my table. Course was served to the right and left of me. But missed me and another person seated quite a distance away. About 5 minutes into the course, someone else at the table highlighted this and my course was served. At this point, I highlighted the other missing course. Course 1 was mediocre. The "greens" were not green. The scallops were limp (not firm and read not fresh). I tried hard but could not finish the scallops. 2. Sunchoke cream with Porcini MushroomOk. Not too bad. Something interesting.3. Trofie Pasta with ScampiAs per other reviews on Aura. This dish was pretty good. Scampi was nice :) Pasta was nice too! One dish that I felt made the mark.4. Black Cod with Saffron & Seasonal VegSeasonal Veg meant 2 'flowers' of Broccoli and 1 Asparagus sliced into half. The sauce and veg on this was really very nice. Mash was pretty yummy too. But I would pass on the same dry looking greens (or whites) that came with this dish (and was also the same tired whites/ "greens" that came with the Scallops. What really disappointed me was the Cod. I love Cod. But to be able to NOT finish the cod was a sad state of affair. The skin should be better crisped. And the Cod was plain tasteless. I went half and stopped.5. Amedel Chocolate & Banana CakeI am not a desert fan. But this really did hit the mark. Well done to your Pastry Chef! Yummy.I like to say part of the disappointing experience was because the restaurant was new. But it is NOT so new anymore. I wanted to say it could have been because it was a catered lunch, but that is no excuse for any restaurant.Overall a really really disappointing experience and I am definitely very unlikely to want to try 5th floor (which was my plan for dinner with friend in the near future)

The visit to national gallery was wonderful and the view from Aura sky lounge was splendid. Overall experience marred by the poor standard of customer service, even from the assistant Manager Chin himself. Our order of just simply a cheese platter took forever to come, on repeated reminders it finally came way after my husband had finished his drink. No apology was given for the delay, instead Chin flatly told us it took only 18mins according to their order chit. It was definitely not the case, was more than half an hour. We requested for a complimentary drink on the house for the delay, was flatly rejected without even an offer of a glass of water to go with the cheese platter. Had expected a higher standard of service recovery from an assistant manager. It was obvious he couldn't care less about customer satisfaction, all he wanted to do was just get on with his task.Hope Aura would invest more into its staff to level up to the good views and nice ambience. Disappointed

I have been lucky enough to eat at some brilliant restaurants in my travels. And to be honest Singapore when I visit is about the hawker food. But last night I was astonished by the food at Aura given I had read some less than great reviews.We arrived very late (10pm) but the staff were happy to seat us and the food that came shortly thereafter was nothing short of superb. Foie Gras was divine, wagyu carpaccio also exceptional. The mains we shared were of the highest standard especially the oxtail pasta, as good as anything I have eaten in Italy.My highest compliments also to the wait staff led by the brilliantly upbeat Alvin. Maybe during a serious business dinner too much of a talker but with a relaxed table of people he was as big a highlight as the food.I'm not sure why this restaurant gets mixed reviews - maybe during busier periods it struggles to provide the care you want. But on our visit everything was exceptional. In a sea of sameness Aura stands for something very different

We had the brunch set with free flow of prosecco. Good value. The food was really great and the waiter was really attentive. After knowing that I don't take ham, he sent out additional dish of the Foie gras. Was delicious. Great Service and good food
4
The set lunch is great value, only $32 for 3 course plus tea & coffee. The food was good, but I expected it to be great considering the beautiful venue and fine dining feel. The service was great until we asked if we could split the bill, they said we couldn't, so we asked if seperate invoices would be okay - they allowed us to do this, but it was very obvious they weren't happy about it and it showed. We left on a low note which was disappointing as we had such a lovely time

After waiting for several weeks to try the much talked about salad bar at Aura, I was left highly disappointed. Yes, there were about 6-7 salads to choose from, but by no means were they substantial enough to count as a meal. There was a frittata (consists of egg) and God knows how long it had been sitting out for, so it was wreaking a foul stench. Definitely not fresh. And salads must be served fresh or you might as well eat take out from your local cafe. Why spend 21 dollars per person for mediocre "food." The other salads were all vegetarian (there you go, maybe that's the only positive - vegetarians are welcome here), and did not taste any better than cut up vegetables with salt, pepper and lemon. So much more could have been done with this salad bar: quinoa salad, wild rice salad, tuna nicoise, caesar, caprese. I could go on. I suggest Aura should look into Qantas' Business Lounge's fare. Their lounge in Sydney offered THE best salads, that were fresh and actually tasted good. Of the 7 salads, I found only 2 that were remotely palatable; and now how much pumpkin, peppers, and zucchini is one expected to eat to validate the set price?!! If you want to pay 21 dollars for the view, go ahead, but do eat elsewhere

If you are visiting the National gallery and you are looking for somewhere to eat and rest the tired legs this is the place. A great menu with delicious food, great friendly staff and service and a very good wine list to join all the above. Do not miss out but make a booking it can get quite full
4
nice place on the 6th floor of the national gallery
great for quiet evening out in the city away from the crowd
6th floor serves only drinks while the 5th serves food & drinks

Awesome views, great ambience, good food - what more could one want. Go visit it if you get a chance..

So the view is what you come here for. One side has peninsula shopping centre so in the face. The other wise if the beautiful esplanade, marina bay sands and the Ferris wheel - very nice. Food was a bit disappointing. The burrata starter was lovely. The fish dish very disappointing. It must have been the flattest snapper ever - noteworthy in its flattest. So a bit dry.

We had the foie gras with apple and the Parma ham with melon for starters which were excellent. My linguine with clams was good too, but my friend's pesto trofie with prawn was a little too salty.We had tiramisu (average - and there's a saying that you should judge an Italian restaurant by the tiramisu) and baileys feuillante (this was very good).The restaurant was full, and extremely noisy probably due to the low ceiling and the number of people there. Might be a good idea to have lesser tables and place them further apart? I came out with a bad headache due to the noise and we couldn't hear what each other said and had to raise our voices to communicate.Service was average, they were probably short of staff. The waiter who handed us the menu did not inform us about the existence of the value for money 4-course set dinner so we ended up ordering ala carte which cost about 20-30% more even though we had similar food to the set. We were also presented with the wrong bill and luckily my friend noted the errors before we made our payment.

We were exploring the new museum and happened upon Aura on a weekday at lunchtime. They offer an Italian food salad bar at a fixed price along with juices and wine (extra). There were a dozen salads including a frittata. You don't find this sort of menu very often. Everything we tried was reasonably flavorful, not delicious, but pretty good. The atmosphere is pleasant and the view of The Esplanade, Marina Bay, etc. is remarkable. Haven't tried the dinner but we will

We had brunch at Aura and it was one of the best brunch I have ever had in Singapore. $48++ per person is definitely worth the money. Food was fantastic, yummy and well presented . It was a fine-dinning brunch. We really had a very enjoyable time there. Highly recommended. The art gallery itself and the building, a former Supreme Court and city hall are worthy a visit. Singaporean and PR are free entry. Foreigners $20

A medium sized 90 seat ('vibrant destination') ristorante with 200 seat ('Sprawling') sky lounge at the converted National Gallery ('grandest iconic location'). We went for lunch and overall it was a very pleasant experience from restauranteur Beppe de Vito of &Sons, Il Lido and Southbridge 'fame'. In the pasta section, we enjoyed the spaghetti with crab and porcini (A),very much al dente and just enough crab and the mushrooms to infuse the pasta with good tastes from the sea and the woods. Liguini with clams and bottarga was a B - a bit bland and the clams a bit tasteless. Mu companion didn't finish it. They are not at the highest point of Il Lido at its peak but ramping up nicely. Will return another day to try their $18 salad bar at the sky lounge

Aura sky lounge had the worst service with no attempt at service recovery at all for New Year's Eve. They gave our pre-paid table away to a walk in group even knowing that we were patronizing your restaurant downstairs and only your restaurant manager who wasn't even responsible for the sky lounge said sorry. The lounge manager barely cared and the owner Bepe didn't even bother to do anything about it when informed and shown proof of payment and reservation. The restaurant staff tried to do something about it but the manager just did not seem bothered. In fact it was the sky lounge manager that gave our table away in spite of staff telling him it was already reserved. Nothing was done for a very long time in spite of repeated requests for a table or even a refund. yes we were willing to walk away and put the incident behind but you wouldn't even consider. Ad hoc seating was only put together after half and hour and it was worse off seating than our original tables. And on top of that, no attempts of apologies or of trying to make things right at all. Food was only so-so. I won't be going back again If I could give this a zero rating, I would

A dozen of us spent NYE at Aura. The food was decent enough- we had the set menu and the scallop carpaccio was fresh whilst the pasta was perfectly al dente and flavorful. The steak was a little dry but balanced by the juicy sliver of foie gras. Service was acceptable but not exceptional. We had made our NYE booking a month ago and also reserved a table on the outdoor terrace to watch the fireworks. When we adjourned to our reserved table at 1130pm (we had paid in full Sgd1,000 for each table of 4) to find out that they had given our table to a walk-in customer. Another group of people nearby also suffered the same fate. This is extremely annoying and unprofessional. I won't be coming back to Aura
5
Not a well known location but one of the best views on the city and skyline from the rooftop of the National Gallery, over two floors. Elegant and modern decor downstairs, with another upstairs section with views and a sizeable outdoor area with a bar. Clearly suitable for private events and parties. Service is good and well staffed, many waiters are Italian which adds to the character of the restaurants. Food is western with a creative and sophisticated touch, so better for a more formal dinner. Good choice of wines. In-line expensive to most fancy restaurants in Singapore
4
A nice place to chill over drinks and catch up with friends or family.
The view is fantastic. I am sure the night view wld be stunning
Was here for drinks.

Fab food, service and view. Food was very fresh and well prepared. service was exceptional. Look for Alvin.

LOVED the aura sky lounge experience. Wonderful view, cocktails and attentive staff.Went into the restaurant for dinner. Decent food and floor staff were fantastic, but felt that the Managerial staff in suits were rather snooty. No repeat of our orders, no smiles or pleasantries even though we said thank you a few times, as guests. Just unnecessarily stand-offish attitude.
4
We went for Sunday lunch and the S$48 menu, a great choice. The anti pasta and pasta were a meal in themselves; calimari, parma ham with melon, a selection crostini with burata and crab, plus two pasta with prawns and a duck ragu - all excellent.The main course options are beef, cod or scallops. We both went for the beef, a small portion beautifully cooked. A couple of dessert options left us feeling pleasantly full. For drinks you can either go for the S$98 option including free flow prosecco, or do as we did a choose wine by the glass.The meal was finished by having coffee on the upstairs balcony with great views over The Padang towards MBS. Service throughout was attentive and of course the surroundings in the National Gallery add to the ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed it and are returning soon with friends

After the waitress put down three places of pasta on our table she came back to take those food away and brought it to another table because they arrived before us...:/ we haven't touched the food but it was very embarrassing moment for the restaurant. The Xmas menu was very average - you pay for the view that's it..

We had dinner here on a Wednesday night and it was packed. The restaurant is on the fifth floor of the new national gallery and doesn't have much of a view at night, but if you go to the bar upstairs the view is fabulous. I had the linguine with clams and bottarga - the pasta was al dente and the clams plump and juicy. The red snapper was also excellent although the serving was a tad small. Desserts of mango and coconut trifle and molten chocolate were not especially memorable. Most of the wine is expensive although the house wine is reasonable. The Restaurant is classy and lively and may be too noisy for some people but that's the way Italian eateries are meant to be.
4
Beautiful setting on the upper floors of the National Gallery - The restaurant is on the 5th floor and the cafe on the roof top on the 6th floor. The views are spectacular esp at night. Food is authentic Italian. The pasta with white truffles was my favourite. The cod was very nicely done with a crisp outer layer but soft juicy meat within. The highlight of the meal was the profiteroles in 3 different flavours - Definitely must try! Service is attentive and prompt. However the restaurant is very noisy so hard to have a good conversation there. Sitting al fresco upstairs on the roof top is much better and we did that for our post-dinner drinks.
3
We went for a business lunch. Whilst things started off well, it was apparent that they had a few teething problems. Firstly we got oil and no bread. Also whilst the entrees came quickly, once the restaurant filled up the main meals were slower. Finally the restaurant was quite noisy and the music made it even noisier which wasn't so good for a work lunch. On the other hand the set lunch price at S$32 wasn't bad. Whilst a great lunch venue and has potential, I wouldn't come for a work lunch as its too noisy and more of a tourist or tai tai lunch venue.

We had a post cinema spontaneous supper. Initial impressions we promising, iconic setting, great views, and a well laid out smart looking modern restaurant. We had the house pinot grigio, it was fine. The food was mixed. fro starters the scallops with truffle and quails eggs were delicious- a really exciting and tasty dish. It was generous with truffle and scallops. Well done! The foie gras was also very good- a generous and perfectly cooked example. The grilled octopus was was fine. For main courses we had the crab pasta. it was OK. The spaghetti itself was very good, and had been made in a brass pasta press giving it the rough texture to hold the sauce well, and it was cooked to perfection by my friends standards. The crab sauce was a bit too like Hienz tomato soup with tinned crab- this is being a little harsh but it did not taste of flakes of delicious fresh crab mixed with a homemade tomato, olive oil and onion classic Italian sauce. It was a generous portion and not bad. The linguine a la vongole should be a great dish that tastes of the sea- ozone, and fresh atlantic breezes. The layout was pretty but it was too salty- this was from two friends who both like salt. The service was effusive and pretty good, (one of our waiters was a little smelly) and after we had ordered a waiter recommended other things to us- slightly annoying, especially when he recommended I try the burnt wheat Burnt Wheat Orecchiette with Asparagus and Guanciale. I Was expecting a fun dish with a delicious smokey home made orecchiette and generous slices of guanciale scattered with asparagus tops. Instead I got a grey pasta on a grey dish with a sprinkling of fried guanciale bits and some sliced asparagus. In truth, it showed thought and effort but the sum of the whole was not greater than the parts. The asparagus was well cooked and the sauce spicy with peperoncini- which I loved but it ddi not really do it for me. Overall would I go back, yes, but not in a huge hurry. It was a good experience but i think the chef needs a little tweaking for my palate

Western food in Singapore is often equated to Italian food, hence the term Italian seems a little stretched at times. This is a fairly new restaurant inside the national gallery offering Islian food . I understand the lunch menu is different, so my comments are based on a dinner experience. The pasta, wonderful. Home made. Tasty and great combinations.so here we have a winner. The appetizers can be a bit of a hit and miss. A classic and fashionable dish, Burrata with cherry tomatoes is very tasty, albeit the Burrata resembles more of a mozzarella in texture, with little creaminess .perhaps it was too aged. But the rest of the dish was tasty. Main courses are good, pork and fish. But I would stick to pasta

Amazing experience ! Being vegetarian , they made us most delicious pasta . Service was best thing , Alvin who served us made our evening a memorable one ! Chill up at bar and admire the beautiful skyline of singapore !

We decide to go for drinks with friends, the view was very beautiful from the bar area.
The cocktails were ok and the food was nice but the service needs a bit touch up.

Dinner last night at the newly-opened Italian restaurant located in the National Gallery of Singapore was truly sub-par. We came here because we are huge fans of Chef Beppe de Vito and his il Lido Restaurant. We came with high expectations but were sorely let down by:(1) Quality of Food served and (2) the wait staff. The restaurant opened at 6.30pm. Even if you were 3 minutes early, they WILL NOT let you in. The Malay girl manning the counter was soo rude & confrontational, we wondered if it was a good idea to place her there. All 3 of us felt that her attitude was like a spoilt brat and she was condescending! Secondly, the bald headed waiter who served us was too talkative, intrusive and nosey. We had to remind him many times to bring us water and replenish our olive oil (he would talk away than serve us the most basic stuffs!). All 3 of us felt very uncomfortable by his non-stop chatter & attitude. You really don't expect to find such wait staff working in a fine Italian restaurant. Thirdly, the food served was sub-par. Total bill for Dinner for 3 pax amounted to way over $400. Was it worth it? Nope. We chose the 4-course Set Dinner costing $80++ per pax and the food didn't "wow" us. In fact we all felt that the pasta served at the inexpensive Pastamania chain of restaurants were better! - The Burrata with Cheese and Tomatoes was soft. Terrible.- The Tagliolini and Spaghetti with Crab Meat and Porcini(2 different types of pasta) were bland and... Please take a look at the pics posted. I'll let you guys decide. But please DON'T order these pasta! The Foie Gras was OK. The Hokkaido Scallops was a tad undercook. Just average tasting.The dessert - Hazelnut Coulant was beyond terrible! The ice cream on 3 of our plates had already melted by the time it arrived at our table. The "pudding" was so dry, even a chiffon cake was more moist! This was the 2nd worst Italian restaurant we have been to in Singapore in terms of Food, Classiness.The worst Italian restaurant in terms of quality of food and classiness is Procacci. Rating for Food: 2 stars (out of 5)Rating for Service: 2 starsRating for Attitude of Staff: 1 starAmbience of Restaurant: 3 starsWe could not go to the Aura Sky lounge for drinks because it was closed for a private event.Will we return? Definitely NO. We'll stick to il Lido!! Footnote:I doubt the restaurant will have repeat customers if they don't do something quickly and RE-TRAIN the staff. The staff at Aura need to learn the basics of how to serve a customer well in a classy restaurant environment like how the il Lido team behaves! And the Aura wait staff incl that Malay girl at the door need to learn to be humble and polite

we all had the set lunch n everyone found the food very average n I thought the Pasta was over done n the lamb not so good. the dessert was the best course! the choc dessert will be the only reason I will return. service was average but the place is very noisy and u can't hear ur lunch conversation very well.

I took my wife to Aura, as curious to check out the recently opened National Gallery, and it's stunning architectureTo our disappointment, we found the restaurant uncomfortably noisy compounded by low ceilings. Food was disappointing: the octopus starter rather tasteless, and the recommended crab and porcini pasta bland. Thankfully, service was brisk and friendly. Unimpressed!

I am giving it 3 stars for the fact that it is a relatively new restaurant. (If not it would have just been 2 stars) Here's our experience and the areas for improvement:(Date: 29.11.15, Time: 1900hrs)1. We had drinks at the sky lounge before dinner and was excited to chill with the awesome view. Prices of the drinks were reasonable but i was incredibly annoyed when i wanted to order calamaris and they told me it was sold out. I then ordered fries and it was sold out as well! I mean these are really basic bar food and if you are expecting a weekend crowd, please stock it up! Its frozen anyway! I then asked what was available and went with the tomato bruschetta. It was $16 and the portions were pathetic, do not order the snacks at the bar, its a ripped off. The saving grace was the cocktails were good and it was value for money. 2. The bar's USP is the view that it has, we were seated outside and our view were the butts of many other people which was terribly annoying. I understand that the deck is open for people to enjoy and they would have to walk by our table or perhaps take a picture. That is perfectly fine and acceptable because it is for everyone.What i really hate is the fact that many people could just stand right in front of our table with their butts facing us for the whole time we were there and the wait staff said nothing. If you are telling people the view is your USP, then please make sure the non-patrons do not take that away from the patrons.3. We then proceeded to dinner and the first thing that hit me was how low the ceiling was. It really didn't help that the restaurant was 80% full and it was noisy as hell. It was hard to have a decent conversation with my partner. Service was really slow despite having about 5 staff on the ground with about 70 pax to serve. It is not acceptable. From what i see, staff were just running around without proper job allocation and the staff lack initiative. E.g. Our water was finished and we had to ask for a refill on several occasions. This is so basic, i feel embarrassed that i have to ask them several times for water. 4. One of my pet peeve is that the staff DO NOT have name tag on! i am not trying to shame anyone but i really wanted to compliment the Malay gentlemen who served our table. Although not the most efficient as he was running around a lot, he did provided us with good service and was very warm. There was another Indian Gentlemen who complimented me for what i was wearing, and i appreciate that, but i would really hope he paid more attention to the service than what i was wearing. 5. Food was a hit and miss, with potential to be really good. We had the Scallops Crudo with Truffle and Smoked Quail Eggs for appetizers and it was the best dish! I would recommend it as the scallops were very fresh and well seasoned, leaving a very sweet after taste. We then have the Spaghetti with Crab and Porcini. It was very nice and the crab were generous, i was however hoping to have more Porcini. It could use a bit more flavouring but that is a personal preference. Overall, this dish is also worth trying. The 1st main was Black Cod Baked in Cartoccio. I was quite surprised that it was baked in "Plastic" and the presentation was horrible. It didn't feel good to be eating the fish our of the plastic and i was expecting it to be cooked in perhaps tinfoil or perhaps parchment paper. Cod was fresh and tasted good. On a personal level, i also wish it could be more flavorful. I wouldn't order this again as i have tasted much better cod in other places. The 2nd Main was the Smoked Duck with Foie Gras, Endive and Orange. The Foie Gras was good, the duck was too gamey to be enjoyed. Although portion was huge and well worth the price, we couldn't finish it due to the taste and smell of game. The Malay waiter who provided good service noticed it and came over to ask if everything was ok. He offered a change of dish after the feedback but we were too full so we declined. For a glass of wine, a cocktail, one appetizer, one pasta, and 2 mains and tea; we paid close to $200. With the price, there are a lot of other options around the area that we can choose from. Overall, Aura has many places to improve on from the Food to the Service. It has potential and i hope it will be able to attract the crowds

Service is wanting. Food is decent. To be honest we are spoilt for choice in terms of good restaurants in Singapore. Its ironic how the new staffs were making a positive difference... cant say for the rest. Disappointed, was really having a good time initially. any saving grace to it is that they have a lounge with a nice view and food was decent
2
This is a truly iconic building which has been beautifully restored and deserves an outstanding restaurant and bar - sadly the team at both Auro and the Lounge upstairs fall well short of the mark. The restaurant itself is not the most spectacular I have ever seen but it was busy so had some atmosphere - menu is limited but that is fine so long as the quality is there and it is all available - unbelievably 2 out of the 8 main course were unavailable (a Friend went along last week and had the same experience). The food we had was fine but the service very slow - frankly there are much better Italians in town After our meal we went upstairs to the lounge - the location is spectacular but the place was deserted - how can that be on a Saturday night - when we asked for one last drink it was clear that the bar staff had already sett their sights on going home. Reluctantly they served us one more drink I hope one day that someone makes a great success of his venue but on the evidence of last night it won't be this tea
3
The 4-course meal was worth the trip and price. The Foie Gras bolognese was rich and pasta well made. Hokkaido scallops for starters and grilled cod for mains didn't disappoint. But maybe was the price tag that made it tasty. The service was inconsistent and were kept waiting almost half hour for our mains cause they forgot. The space on the floor is great for private parties with an amazing view of MBS skyline
2
Foie gras was tasty but duck was tough. Place is rowdy after 7.45pm when a huge party group entered last night, who seem pal with restaurant management. Table conversations are difficult to hear. Attitude of some staff is discriminating in silencing guest and humiliating. The saving grace is service with sincerity by Suraj
