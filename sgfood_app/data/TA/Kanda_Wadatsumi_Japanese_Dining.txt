Loved the refined food selection with items in season. The sushi was very good and presentation very pleasing

We had sashimi, beef on a ceramic plate and the sea bream rice was delicious. One pot is sufficient for 4 pax

Visited twice. The omakase here is good value. Service here is good and warm. The fish here is fresh too.

Quality food and desserts. Chef prepared an additional dessert as a birthday surprise for our friend.

Me and my wife celebrated our wedding anniversary there. The restaurant staff was attentive and nice and the service was good.
The omakasen menu is good. To top it up, they gave us a small anniversary tokens at the end of our dinner. Nice gesture!

Food is of good quality, but money wise not of good value. We spent about 100 per capita, and I was still a bit hungry...Service is a bit problematic. We stayed for a bit longer chatting after we finished all the food, and the waitress stopped coming to fill water. I had to go out to ask for water several times. Another incident is that when we were about to pay, one of my colleagues asked whether they offer any discount for certain brand of credit card (as many other larger restaurants would do), and another colleague was joking that it is CNY maybe there would be some. And the waitress just replied, "but we are a Japanese restaurant" and left. I wonder whether she had managed to find the worst answer in such tight time frame.Maybe that's why it was quite empty on a Friday night..

Eye catching map of Japanese fisheries and a pride fish sign at the entrance. Very friendly staff. We went for the omakase and were not disappointed. I also had the recommended Takusake to go with the dishes. Perfect. Carefully prepared inviting dishes served with care. Relaxing atmosphere. Recommended

 excellent food that was just mind blowing. We ordered ala carte dinner and the sea bream claypot rice as a stand or. It was just a fish head on rice and looked unimpressive when served but when i took a mouth it was really booomz! Take note it's a huge portion though and we had to takeaway half home. Sesame tofu was very unusual and i loved it as it combines two of my favourites. Sashimi was amazingly fresh and hit the spot. I highly recommend this place which gives much better value compared to pricy places like shinji, ki sho etc. Which just overwhelms with expensive ingredients. Kanda just gives good food cooked well

One thing that you will not do is leave hungry from Kanda Wadatsumi after their Omakase Grand menu. Seven courses of raw, pickled, simmered, fried and grilled dishes treated with finesse. What I like most is the fact that all ingredients are treated with respect and if you enjoy food for it's natural taste, then this is the place for you. The eighth course - dessert - on the night that I dined there was their black sesame pudding. It was a standout. At $120, the price of the omakase menu may not appear to be too different from other Japanese restaurants in Singapore but the freshness of the ingredients and the generous servings make this place great value.

Won't mind the food. Saw many ordered something claypot. Looks yummy too. Love food presentation. Very short handed though...
5
Excellent, fresh seafood imported from Japan. Definitely the most value-for-money omakase I've had in Singapore.
The fuss-free dining environment and hospitable staff also made our stay very comfortable.
I highly recommend this place!

Had an excellent lunch. Great quality, super fresh. Had the sushi set lunch, and walked out super stuffed. Will come back again for sure!

I had fresh sashimi including uni and I would want to come back to try the omakase one day! Good ambience as well
3
I had bara chirashi and Uni was replaced as it was unavailable.. sesame ice cream was really good though!

This is set among the row of food restaurants in Tras Street. There is selection of set and ala carte menu. We enjoyed the fresh seafood from Nagasaki and had two separate orders of hot pot (unagi and prawn). Good service and there is one for one corkage free for sakes.

This is the joint to patronise. It offers genuine Japanese food in quiet ambience. Service is good. Portions are also good enough for small eaters wanting to taste a variety of such fare. We had bara chiroshi, Wagyu beef, fish, gama tofu, tempura vegetables, not forgetting its desserts! The set meals come with rice, salad, 2 side dishes and miso soup. It was a good satisfying meal for our group of 5! Worth a visit
5
There were 3 of us: 2 had the sushi Omakase (so good and fish super fresh), 1 had the S$60 omakase much better value as it gave her a taste of wagyu and some of their signature dish. We enjoyed it would come back again when we have another celebration
4
The cubed sashimi Chirashi bowl with generous enough portion of Unni was rather delicious as the fish was delivered on that Tuesday. The even enjoyed the just-right portion of rice - cooked almost to perfection. My only wish - if only the sashimi cubes were just a little more. This S$32 set is well worth the quality of experience we had. Unfortunately I do not think the ala carte 3 kind sashimi is worth the value. Worth checking out if you are around Chinatown or financial district area. It's only a 5-7 mins walk from Telok Ayer/Amoy street. PS: Poor uninformed waitress had to run to and fro to find out what the 6-piece and 3-piece sashimi they were offering.
4
The greetings given upon entering the restaurant , followed by the intimate setting and the Japanese chefs that were visible through the kitchen brought out the ambience really well !
5
Kanda Wadatsumi is the showcase restaurant in Singapore by the fishermen's association of Japan. As u can imagine, the seafood served is fresh and of highest quality. Even better, the nicely prepared food is offered at reasonable price in the context of Singapore.
5
Great food,great service! Will definitely go again and again...
Sashimi very fresh, wagu beef are tasty too.
4
Their authentic Japanese cuisine and staff who are fluent in Japanese tend to make one forget that you are not dining in Japan!

Overall experience was good but was not wowed. I like the sushi rice. Will go back again to check out other food.

We sort of stumbled upon this place while walking along tras st and it was a lovely surprise. The food was great and we had our 1st try of nodoguro sashimi, which was unforgettable!

We booked this restaurant for my wife's birthday on June the 4th. I specifically informed them that we will be celebrating my wife's birthday and they said they will do something for her. We arrived at 7:30pm. The menu even stated that, if told beforehand, they will give her some thing for her birthday. We were full of anticipation.....but it was not to be! The food came and went (the meal took more than 2 hrs ) and the bill came without any mention of the birthday treat. They were also very short-handed. (which probably contributed to their mess). We were too shy to ask for it so just paid and went off ( ~10:45pm). At 11:30+pm , when I was about to go to bed, they called my phone to apologize that they have forgotten to give us the birthday treat and offered to give us a free omakase if we go back to dine. But my wife did not feel that it was worth it. The omakase we ordered did not meet our expectations at all. At $120 it was not the cheapest omakase in town. My dinner cost me over $500 and I feel that it wasn't money well spent at all. I've eaten at omakases costing over $300 per head and came out feeling good that I have had a good meal...but sorry to say I did not feel that way this time. I'm most disappointed and will probably not venture into this restaurant again...:( There are so many japanese restaurants in town....I'm afraid they don't really have a 2nd chance to redeem themselves if they screw up on first impression. Their service staff were good though but not enough to make up for the disappointment we had to endure

Ambience + interior of the restaurant = sushi bar / table sittingService = friendly Food = Bara chirashi (cube raw fish and tamago) don set lunch (2 ways of eating: original taste, with sesame sauce and with bonito soup) & Unagi (eel from Japan) don set lunch comes with salad and bonito soup The salad dressing is a little bit salty, the serving size is maybe too little for big eater. You can taste the freshness and sweetness of the sashimi, the combination of the rice and sashimi is so delicious and overall experience is like eating Japanese food in Japan. The Unagi don is average. Just that the Unagi is too little. ($32++ per set for both

My wife and I have a very nice Omakase lunch on a lazy afternoon. Tucked just behind the busy Tanjong Pagar Road, this unassuming restaurant has great choice of food and lots of characters. There are also a few Japanese customers enjoying, so it must be as original as it gets. Very attentive chef and servicing staffs, introducing each course with proudly. Appetizer and salads are fabulously prepared. With this main course, Bara Chirashi Don, wonderfully fresh, especially loving the uni or sea urchin which is not over-powering but just simple smooth texture that you want to order an uni sushi immediately.Will be back to try something different soon

Was a spot-on recommendation from a Japanese colleague. Simple but exquisite menu, sourced directly from Japan. Their "standard" sushi and sashimi sets and omakase were completed with generous and fresh chef-selection of fish. Selection was NOT the run of the mill usual suspects but included ootoro (was a fabulous surprise) and other quality and seasonal but uncommon fish. Restaurant atmosphere is casual, but the service was attentive and cheery
