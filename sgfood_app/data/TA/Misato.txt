The food at this place is good. Mostly individual portions with great presentation and attractive prices. The cha soba is very good and is highly recommended. The service, however, needs improvements

I went to Misato with my Friend yesterday (4th Mar 18) at 5:45pm, location is easy to reach and their foods was not bad. Their Pancake was good for sharing, but the brownie sauce on top was too much and it will bring us one step back (please do adjust the portion of the sauce, if can) and I was really madly in love with their MISATO OYAKUDON!! � the chicken and egg in the seasonal broth over the Japanese rice OMG!! I’m surely will be back just for this DON. Their desserts are about green tea and black sesame which is good as Japanese dessert, but the taste and combinations just so so, not thing special or excellent.. I have much expectation on their dessert actually.. But..! Food presentation was excellent, no big contrast in reality and in menu (Well done Misato Chefs ). Foods may takes a little big longer of time to serve, it may due to the Chef insist putting their afford on food presentation, and Misato aren’t fast-food restaurant, so I do understand but I can’t imagine how they work on peak hours.Only 2 staff on the floor, the two ladies , their service was not bad. They will tell you what’s the daily special and popular item on the menu, explained the way to enjoy the food, they know their product well and they do check back our satisfaction of food which I’m surprised because this act really rarely found in this kind of restaurant, good job !!Anyway, I do really enjoyed my lovely Sunday dinner in your restaurant but I hope you can improve their attention on customer, your number of staff and speed on preparing foods. Thankyou!! Lovely!!

So glad we visited their new location in Orchard Centrepoint. Their old place already surprised with excellent quality Japanese food but the new one topped it with a brighter designed interior and new even better table ware. Quality and friendly service is as good as it ever was and I won't miss coming back on my next trip to Singapore

Restaurant so Japanese ambience. Everything is ultra japanese. From serviettes, chopstick holder to food. In the quest we were served starter with their japanese tea, it exudes the aroma of roasted green tea. Food presentation needless to comment, are real than fine dining. Service is impecable inspite of crowds which gradually filling the restaurant. Thank you to the chef and staff making our dinner so special Jack Tan and famil

The food was good and service was great as well. Love how the gyoza is done, very unique. However, the gyoza came really late, it only arrived after we finished our main courses. The quality of the food and service made up for it. And their food items are really affordable. Will be back again

I had the Katsu Chicken Curry which was excellent. The spicy curry sauce has carrots and potatoes. It was served separately in a small pitcher and there was good bit of it. The chicken was underneath a bed of rice. It was crispy and nice and hot. Great for dipping in the sauce. The platter also include a couple pickled veggies (I really liked the onions) and some cabbage. I really liked the food and for the price it was extremely good and the quantity was generous. I also had a carrot and ginger juice that was fresh and had a nice ginger bite. I'll be back when I'm near the Cathy/Dhoby Ghaut
