Fresh seafood cooked in Chinese style. Not so fancy place but clean. A little slow to serve during dinner time. Shrimp with black bean sauce is wonderful. No parking though.

The location has been updated (pending review) to The Grandstand at Turf City.The location is easily accessible by car and free shuttle bus services from Clementi MRT Station.The venue is huge as they took the whole 3rd floor of the Grandstand. They have function and private rooms for reservation/hire.Food was excellent and of exquisite taste as well as excellent quality. Dim sum was great and the quality was excellent.The uniqueness is the wonton noodle and the wonton is huge compared to most other places. Great place for families to bond over an excellent meal that does not blow a hole in the wallet

Seafood of fish and la la well prepared and good.Suckling pig was also good but forgot the crepe.Noodles and the vegetables was also good. Not oily and just right.Service appears to be short staffed. Cashier and another came to help out after I notified.Helps when staff do not deny their SHORTCOMING and make amends and help out. Brav
