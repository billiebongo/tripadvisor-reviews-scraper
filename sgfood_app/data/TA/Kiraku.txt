Food serving was very fast. Service was good too. Unfortunately, the place smell a little bit funky - just a little.

Kiraku has never dissappoint us whenever we bring our clients/guests for lunch. Great food, nice ambience!

I had a craving for sashimi and had it amply gratified at Kiraku. From the decor to the service and the food, everything was understated but good. I had an enjoyable time. Will definitely be back.

A depressing lunch! Forgot my order.... love it when you’re hungry and they forget half your meal! Not going back her

Though a bit pricey, the restaurant serves good Japanese food and set menus for Lunch.Interior is also good so when you enter the restaurant, you can feel this one is a bit high class Japanese restaurant. And the servers are all very pleasant and kind but the food serving takes so long. I went with my customers but only my dish did not show up so others had to wait till I get mine. Hope you can speed up on this

Kiraku Located at #B1-01, 55 Market Street. At KIRAKU it offers acceptable Japanese cuisine in Singapore at a reasonably price, serving a tantalizing collection of dishes that are suitable for casual dining and group gatherings. It presents a good selection of fresh spread of vegetables, seafood and many more, the sushi platter, and the Shabu Shabu hot pot really stands out, but there is something for everyone on the menu. On the whole a must try for all Japanese food lovers, It gave me another view point of having Japanese’s dining in a sophisticatedly way. The Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. Overall, So Satisfied, We Couldn't Ask For More

Shocking experience... had extra serving of plastic in their cucumber salad. The manager wasn’t apologetic at the onset and tried to dismiss the case with “I will give you a a 10% discount”. I had lost my appetite given their lack of care and hygiene standard! Unbelievable! I have no intentions of ever returning to this restaurant again!

Food was good. Service was great. Customer arrived late and added order much later. His order was expedited so food was served with ours. We ordered beer which turned out to be not available. Waitress replaced our order with another beer which was more expensive automatically.

This is my second visit to Kiraku. I popped in for a quiet sashimi lunch about a year ago, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and freshness of the sashimi. When my daughter suggested dinner here last night, based on recommendations from her colleagues, I was looking forward to trying it again.Most people know Singapore is not the most economical place to have a drink, and many venues are stingy, bordering on downright criminal, serving a quarter thimbleful in a wineglass and charging $15 for the privilege.Not so this place, we didn’t even know it was happy hour until they told us that we were entitled to an extra drink at no additional charge, and they actually filled the glasses up.We had the sushi platter, the soft shell crab roll, pumpkin salad and prawn tempura. Everything was beautifully fresh and nicely presented, the service was great and the overall price was reasonable, about $140 for two.A good, reliable, safe place to pop into for Japanese

As shown by the drinks list, this restaurant aspires to be higher-end than it is. With increasing competition, it is just a me-too Japanese eatery in the CBD. The food is not bad, but nothing to write home about or remember, and ingredients are not necessarily the best

My regular lunch haunt. Great place to meet friends for chat.
Lots of choices at reasonable prices. Easy to book and service was good.

I like this Japanese restaurant. I have dinner with my family. My favorite dish is Premium Dinner Set (S$78)
5
The menu selection is wide. The food was good, Sashimi was fresh and service was attentive. Serving was prompt. Would come again.

Bento sets are ~$40/pax not the most outstanding value in town but decent considering the quality. Good for business lunch. Nothing wow but nothing bad either.
4
Was my first visit and was pleasantly surprised by the food quality and service. Will definitely visit again. We had the black pepper beef and salmon teriyaki bento sets.
2
The restaurant was dark and the food was cold (probably prepared since the morning). Not worth the price.
5
The Executive lunch set was quite filling although it was a bit on the pricey side. Yuzu hot tea was nice but not fantastic so you can give that a pass.

We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday. It was a convenient location for all of us since it's located in the CBD. They gave us a private room which we totally enjoyed, chatting and laughing loudly! We ordered the premium set, kani set and also the shabu shabu, both wagyu beef and pork. The food was great, we enjoyed every dish. The service was excellent, especially Nareenth who was so attentive and helpful. The other 2 ladies who served us we're very nice and helpful too. We will definitely be back again!

Went there for lunch on 7 April 2017. Was recommend to take the premium set lunch. The sashimi quality is so...so. The sushi is good but very small. Not worth the price paid for. The dessert is cheese cake. It is so "rubbery". Informed the waitress about it but her attitude is so nonchalant
3
Lunch time service was slow. Waited for at least 40mins before food came. After waiting for so long, they forgot 1 order and failed to inform it wasn't available from the start. Service recovery was prompt and proceeded to waive for that affected meal. Wont consider returning if your remaining day is packed.
