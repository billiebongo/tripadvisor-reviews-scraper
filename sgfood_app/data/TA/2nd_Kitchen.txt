We had our breakfast here as part of the hotel package of Hotel Value Thompson. Food is passable but food presentation was poor..and it just seems less clean than the hawker style food outlets

A lot of food choices and the service is great. The prices are average and a great convenience since it is really close

Foods served are nice and delicious: ranging from vegetables combinations to chili prawns and crabs and other meat delicacies, etc. Excellent value for money really! We did not have to pay service fee and tax as some other restaurants charge the amount together with the bill; thus, no shocking extras! The place is clean and the staff are friendly and accommodating

They are closing end of month for renovations and revamping style food is sold. We had steamed peanuts served with a tiny bit of juice, be hoon in a pot with clam wine sauce ( my favorite) , calamari coated in salted duck egg n deep fried, giant prawns with chili crab sauce (had better every where....needed starch to thicken sauce) and chicken wings coated in chili paste then deep fried to perfection. Fried pork in sauce was nice too.

We went to this restaurant because our friend stay at Value Hotel and we would like having dinner there. This restaurant is just downstair of the Value Hotel. They served Chinese and Western Food here and the Seafood was tasteful. You can order Beer to spend and enjoy the time because we were fully enjoy here. Maybe will visit here to taste another menu. Its fully enjoyable

Breakfast area was adjacent to the roads. Weather was really warm at this month of May and makes it really uncomfortable eating. Breakfast choices were ordinary and sometimes bland. Scrambled egg was soaked in juice and no saltiness at all. I ate their as part of the free breakfast buffet offered by Value Hotel Thomson. Better eat elsewhere
