Was shopping at Wisma Atria and visited by chance. I ordered Wagyu beef and it came with sprouts, rice and soup. They said the wagyu was from japan and it tasted delicious.The soup was good too. Nothing spectacular though.

The food was oily and smothered in a pepper sauce. We didn't know about the pepper sauce otherwise would have ordered our items without sauce. You get a bowl of soup, rice and oily mixed veggies with your set. We couldn't really taste the premium steak set, steak set and chicken set because of the pepper sauce

One of my favorite teppanyaki restaurant is Heiniu Teppanyaki in 313 Somerset Shopping mall. Price is reasonable and food is superb. Always eat beef set which come with beef , vegetable , rice and soup combo. Request to add more chili as I had if you can tolerate famous Chili Padi. Highly recommended

~has an hour to kill in the east coast so decided to drop by Heniu Teppanyaki at Parkway Parade, this was 2016Nov so things may have changed somewhat~located inside the food court area, their grills were smaller and there were fewer seats than the normal sized outlets~no nonsense efficient service and effectively cooking, while not the normal dining expectation, this is how they do it~ordered my simple deluxe set with sliced pork for $13.90 as I usually did and it tasted exactly like all the other outlets I've been too, simply delicious :

Went on a high recommendation from a family friend , really loved the food They make it fresh right in front of u.Chef are well trained to cook but must say they don't smile at all.We ordered fried rice with veggies -- it was excellent , even repeated the fried rice Not at all expensive as per Singapore standardsMenu is small but they do customise your kind of food I along with my wife and kids allloved the food here Will definitely go here again and I recommend everyone to try this place

We all enjoyed our meals at Heiniu Teppanyaki, after a long day walking around the shops it was nice to sit in the air-conditioning and enjoy an easy casual meal and this is just the place. Very helpful hostess to help with our menu choices and wonderful lime juice drinks. Lovely pepper flavour to the meals we had and they ask if you want chilli added and to what level of heat, which was also thoughtful for some of us 'westerners'!! Well worth coming here especially if you have a family or a larger group as it's reasonably priced

I went for the best dish they have. S$49 for 2. Included each 1 scallop, 1 prawn, a plate of steak, vegetable. But only 1 salmon steak about 80gm shared between us. Volume is there. Taste wise very deplorable. The balance is not there. The salmon came with a sauce that overpowers the salmon. The best to describe the scallop is "char char" like eating wood and drown in a sauce that is not compatible in my opinion. Prawn is ok. Steak cut in all different sizes so some were under, some ok, and, some overcooked. Not too great buddy

The basic value meal set costs just $9 and comes with meat dish of your choice, followed by stir fried vegetables, rice and miso soup. Great for dining alone too at the counter seats.
