It’s a cute little cafe with ice cream, cakes, coffee, and wraps and stuff if you want to stop by for lunch.
The decor is quirky and hip. A nice alternative to just going to a generic Starbucks!

We came here for dessert after dinner at the hawkers market up the road. I had red velvet waffles and my wife had lava choc cake. Both come served with ice cream of your choice.
Enjoyed both, nice service. Cost just over S$21

Nice cafe with good coffee and ice cream. I just had a few moments stop there but the interior is cooky and the people who work there are friendly. Definitely way better than going to a chain!

Stopped by after a long walk for gelato. Had the new york cheese cake and a lychee, lime sorbet. Decided to enjoy it indoors as the cafe was very quiet and nice. Enjoyed the gelato thoroughly. Ambiance of the cafe and interior deco was very quaint. Nice stopover.

Went twice. On my first visit, great evening ice cream and wifi.Second time, the wifi didn't work, and I'm afraid as a solo traveler keeping up to date, that's important to me. Nice friendly service, and assuming the wifi does work normally, I loved it here

Pretty nice . Coffee is pretty good, and so are the waffles and ice cream. Ambience is nice on a Saturday afternoon when it's not too crowded. A place I won t mind spending the afternoon reading in . Give a try ! Car park can be a hassle ... part across the road at the public car park and take a stroll

I have visited this cafe a few times after lunch just for coffee/tea and desserts. We have tried their coffee and tea and I am happy to know that they offer free refills for my teapot! This little gesture made me return to the cafe again as again as I usually drink tea pretty quickly while my partner enjoy his coffee at a slower pace. We have tried their waffles and ice cream and it was very yummy too. Will be back again

I come here regularly to have their gelato. Their durian flavor is my all time favorite. It's dense, soft, gooey and really feels like I'm eating the real thing. The coconut flavor and sabai sabai (thai milk tea) come in a close second place. Their chocolava cakes are also delicious, especially when they're freshly pulled out of the oven.The decor is quirky, but that's par for course for most such cafes. The wifi works well, the seating is comforting, the staff is nice and if I had to pick a reason to complain, it's that credit card payments are only accepted for invoices above $20, and all items require pre-payment, so if you eventually end up having enough to exceed $20, you probably still couldn't end up paying via credit card

The service was good, staff were friendly. Try their waffles and ice cream. We had red velvet waffle and salted caramel ice cream – they went very well together. The ice cream was yum. The place is adorned with old fashioned decoration – very, very nice. It’s a good place to unwind with some coffee/tea and dessert

Ambience is nice and that's about it. We sat down and had to head again to the counter to order something, then wait to pick it up - I don't mind the self service in the busy place but here the waiters were busy with Facebook. Coffee is fine and the passion fruit ice cream was good, but do you seriously need to charge 1SGD for the cone? This seems ridiculous.
