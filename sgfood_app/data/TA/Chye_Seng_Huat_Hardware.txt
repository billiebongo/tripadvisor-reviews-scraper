Vintage shophouse fitted out into a restaurant while retaining it’s old charm. Food was alright. Seems like they’ve updated the menu recently - good move.
Had the carbonara and the serving was huge
5
One of the best espresso coffee in Singapore. Started by the Papa palmetto group (one of the guys who started the coffee movement in Singapore). They have their own Roastery just by the cafe. The Synesso espresso machine delivers every time I visit.
5
We were lucky to have discovered this spot just diagonally opposite the hotel we stayed . Even if you are far away from Tyrwhitt road , please don’t miss out on this hipster joint.
5
First time trying the crab meatballs here, which is surprisingly nice and better than how it looks :p
4
The epitome of hipster. Very crowded even on a weekday afternoon. Cool ambience, good coffee, meh food.
4
Great coffee but dessert need improvement. The ambiance is really good for gathering. Crowded during meal times.
4
Went there for coffee with friends after we finished dinner. Nice vibe. Hot and cold beverages and crafted beer and wines available. The owners did up the place nicely and retained the feeling of this old new place. A pity that cannot have a smoke with whatever you're having in the outdoor area. Nonetheless, can take a few strides outside to smoke
5
Make your way to this neighborhood when visiting. While you will probably be tempted to follow the busloads of tourists into the herbal medicine places across the street, take some time inside this former hardware store to taste some great, locally roasted coffee. We were there on a Sunday morning, along with children, grandparents, and even the shop's cycling group....tremendous fun. Even for just a quick cup in the courtyard, this is worth the trip
5
The outside seating area can accommodate a large group of friends, couples, and even solo hangouts. I loved what the owners did with the place, the outside area is spacious - good for someone claustrophobic like me! it's somewhere you can chill for a couple of hours on a sunny Sunday.Best part? They serve beer here.A good range of desserts provided, I highly recommend the lemon tart - even the people working there say the same (trust me, I asked them!
4
I liked the vibe of this neighborhood cafe, a large central serving area with bar seats, regular tables on the sides and tall couple tables near one wall. They have seating outside as well. Coffee was good, slightly acidic. Brunch options were rather limited, but the French Toast I had was flavourful. Overall its a good option to try out
5
One of the best coffees in SE Asia
Not preoccupied with fashion for light roasting
Very cool hipster joint
5
First time visiting and was quite amazed by what they've done with this old hardware store. Great take on classic singaporean cakes / "kueh". Good for both a coffee or a nice afternoon beer! Good range of beers both bottled and on tap.
5
It's a great place to just chill out/hang out with friends. They have a very pretty outdoor seating area too. The coffee, food and service was really good too. I would highly recommend you to drop by this cafe if you're ever in singapore.
5
Touted as a hipster cafe, I did not expect it to blow me away with the exceptional coffee. We tried the cold brew (white) and the Javanero Pasundan Hand Brew. The tasting notes were not just for show. At the risk of sounding pretentious, I must say the juicy plum and cloves flavour were distinctly present in the undertones of the coffee. Definitely a must try and something we'll come back for.
4
We went for a coffee here and it was spot on. My espresso was just right and my friend enjoyed her latte. Their selection of cakes definitely looks great. We did not eat here, so can't say much about the food. Place is well designed. It's not very spacious, so when it's packed, it can be a bit uncomfortable
4
This chic cafe/roaster is a far cry from its roots as a hardware origins. A destination for coffee afficiandos & tourists, it serves great coffee (as to be expected) in cool industrial surroundingsSeating is less comfortable, & the curry puffs disappointing Make sure you explore the eclectic surrounding area, which includes a Tibetan templ
4
I've went for a coffee, ended up having cake with lemonade. Some of the table are excruciatingly small, however are enough to provide room for a comfortable conversation. Visited during the afternoon, it was a bit loud, but no loud enough to smother the conversation. No one kicked us out after spending 2 hs talking.Do not expect a quick Kopi on the go here. They take it seriously (and it does not come cheap). Some of the waiters seem much more proficient than others.Unexpected experience. Good quality
5
This place is so nice - small but very cozy. We passed by the shop and looked through the window - and thank god for that! Please visit this place and do you self a favor: order the Bircher Muesli and the Almond Crossaint. Wow. Simply wow. And I'm from Denmark where I have muesli every day - but this was so good. They also serve dinner, but we haven't tried that.. but I can only recommend this place for breakfast and nice coffee!
3
Overly salty salmon belly skewer plus a cup of acidic expresso, do I need to say more. It is not that bad to the extend of inedible but i would prefer to take the money elsewhere. There are different types of beer being sold at the courtyard too, different counter from the coffee. Beside the coffee shop, there is a shop selling all coffee related item
4
Drinking coffee has taken a new level of artistry. A previous hardware store is transformed to a cosy bespoke coffee joint. Beans are roasted on-site and then brewed delicately. Amazed by the length that coffee connoisseurs go to savour the best flavours. Would be good to have more vegetarians items on the menu
5
great vibe, super service, really good cappuccino but the true surprise came from the innovative Cold Brew nitro on tap...
5
The über-hip coffee shop not only serves outstanding brew, but also delicious sweets to go with. Coffee-nerds on the next level. The warm Banana bred with espresso butter is to die for…
5
Incredible coffee, delicious almond croissants, adorable décor, lovely staff and awesome (and London-based) beer selection in the evenings. The downside is it isn't open on Mondays so we had to go hunt for breakfast elsewhere!
1
Ordered over the counter and the service is unbearable! Worst attitude of a person taking order and not helpful at all. Never expected that from a well known F&B. Will never visit again to get such treatment again.
4
Not oxymoronic - but how hipster and stagey does a coffee shop need to be to make top 10 in Singapore? Okay, this is the Yogi Berra thing that this is a restaurant where nobody goes anymore because it's too crowded, but so it is. For the kind of people who like this kind of thing, this is the kind of thing they would like. All that said, it's a nice small coffee place that does okay coffee at actually good prices. The nitro sucks, but that is not their fault; it always does, at least to me. But objectively, it is good at what it is designed to be, and that then leads to a very good rating
5
Very good place for brunch, coffee, afternoon tea, orBreakfast. I love the courtyard. Coffee food dessert, all taste great. The location is great, a lot of hipster cafes to touch down if that one is full. Would be nice if more 4-6P table inside however. Some times service can be a bit slow.
4
Really like the building ambience, stays old like they were before. Inside is very cozy. Ordered coffees and food, coffee was great(we ordered picollo, cappuccino and the manual brew), food just standard. There's also a coffee equipment shop behind the coffee shop, and also the beer shop beside i
5
Ahhh such a cool spot! I visited for brunch and a coffee and the food was some of the best I've had in a really long time. There's tons of different coffee choices – I went for a nitro cold brew, which was good. Really nice atmosphere. No wifi though. Make sure you pop into the shop next door – I bought some delicious beans and had such a great chat with the guy working there, John, who was so friendly and helpful
4
Tried this because it has a good review so I gave it a try for my lunch. The food and coffee are very good although it's kinda pricey. It was very packed, not sure just because it's famous or because it was Coldplay weekend of which many tourists in the area. From the outside you won't notice that this place is actually a cafe, but once you go in, the ambience is very cozy and nice.

I have been a supporter of this place for sometime ever since they started. Always like the hand brew coffee which is how coffee should be appreciated. Recently decided to have brunch at CSH again, unfortunately disappointed. Hand brew as always live up to expectation but the coffee is not hot enough. Had the papa breakfast, it was a bad choice - mushrooms was cold, hashbrown tasted like those you buy off the supermarket and microwave, scrambled eggs were ordinary, and worst the sausage is so hard (probably deep freezed and microwave too). Had the laksa linguine, fusion idea is good but lacks character. In every great laksa, the taupok must be soak with laksa and you savour the laksa juice when you take a bite at it. But i got a crispy taupok instead. CSH business has grown since they first started, it is always crowded but i will bring their food, service and quality a notch down after today's experience. I may revisit it in the future, hopefully they remember the traits that bring them success in the past and not swayed by profits at the expense of quality, value and service
4
Love the interior of this café. It was cozy and cool. I had tried their Goji tart with caramel sauce and love it so much.
4
Blueberry tofu cold cheese cake tasted great; the cheese cake wasn't too heavy. The mexi wings were something to die for. I bought the regular size and it could serve up to 5-7 people.
4
I like the interior design! The toufu cheesecake is nice too! I was here in a rush. Hence, didn't have the opportunity to try their food and coffee. But will definitely be back!
5
2nd visit for their coffee , coffee is nice as always but we ordered the blueberry tofu cheese cake it was unexpectedly very nice. Strongly recommend to try their tofu cheesecake and the environment is nice too.
5
I was there on the weekend and it was crowded. I had americano with some bakery and it was really good. Stop bu if you have time!
5
Great place for catching up with friends and have gourmet coffee.
Hope to try the hand brew coffee next time.
5
My wife and I were staying near by Chye Seng Huat Hardware and were in search of a cup of coffee and found so much more.We wish we had more time in Singapore to retur to CSHH for a meal or event.We had a pastry with our coffee, which was very good however the coffee was great. We forget how good coffee can taste, thank you.The building and decor was great as well.Thank yo
4
In their Courtyard there's a little counter with 4 beer taps and a well stocked fridge open in the evenings. It's called 'The Beer Stall'.All imported craft beer and cider - nothing local. I had a Stone Brewing pint for $15. Lots of USA and NZ bottles in the fridge from $12 up.If you are homesick for a favourite beer and are prepared to pay for it this is worth a look. Lovely outdoor setting to enjoy an expensive beer.
5
This place is the meeting point of the heritage walk in the area and it's great. I've never been to this part of singapore and it used to be part of a series of hardware shops. Now there are hotels and cafes in these old warehouses. Chye Seng Huat has established a place for its artisanal coffee and they even have a few roasting machines on site. They also have a testing room for different flavors of coffee. In the evenings they serve craft beer in their courtyard. Ultimately it's a great place to try something different from the run of the mill franchise shops. Personally I thought the food/coffee was not as memorable as the history of the place itself. This place has heart
3
Pricey brunch with average food. Staff is not bad but it feels like a factory. Expect long queue to order since you cannot order from your table. Foods look good tho if you want insta friendly pictures. I would not recommend this brunch given the many other better brunch places in the are
5
My first visit after being here 5 years ago. Still as great as I remember. Great coffee, great staff and now great beer too. What more could you ask for. Definitely worth a visit. Close walk from Lavender MRT
5
I had the laksa with sous vide egg ...twice.
The milo pudding was excellent
The coffee goes without saying ...excellent
The people are friendly
the ambience was great
4
The coffee is really good and there are variety of pastries for you to choose. The cafe itself is very unique but it's quite crowded so I stayed there only for 20 minutes or so.
4
An unique place for friends and family to gather for chill out, birthday or just to have breakfast....

Came here with my fiancée after we ate nearby, here's the breakdown:Ambience: 4.5/5Cleanliness: 3.5/5Customer Service: 4/5Quality of Food: 4/5Value for Money: 4/5Our Orders:Bundaberg Root Beer: 3.5/5Nutella Banana Friands: 4/5Matcha Red Bean Friands: 4/5The Good: Quaint, refurbished outlet that's sleek, classy, with a lovely ambience, and quite a few stops for beer & coffee lovers. The Bad: We thought the cleanliness for the toilet can be better, otherwise the entire place is really lovely!Bottom Line: We will definitely come back again, have yet to explore the full range of the menu, but we totally love the ambience, recommend for Singaporeans who want a quick escape from all the hustle and bustle of the city!
4
To be honest I don't think I would be able to find this cute coffee shop without my friend bringing me there. Absolutely in love with the decoration and the vintage looking menu. The latte was amazing.A luvly place to spend an afternoon with friends :
2
I have been coming here on and off for a few years now, and a lot more lately as I am based in Singapore for a few months. Today really made me realise how much further this place needs to go in order to be a great cafe/restaurant. As normal, we ordered coffee and were told "wait here for the coffee". We ordered breakfast and when they brought out breakfast for my friend, were told "you can get the cutlery inside". So, the girl walked past the cutlery on the way to deliver our meals knowing that we didn't have any, and then told us we had to go inside and get it ourselves. I told the girl that there should be table service, and she replied that they cannot. Being the good friend I walked in and got the cutlery, only for the girl I had just spoken to, to make fun of me to her peers for asking about table service. Here's a hint, don't make fun of the customers when they're standing directly behind you listening to what you're saying. To top it off, there were 3 staff standing behind the counter not doing anything, as well as the girl who delivered the food. It is obvious to me that somebody has made a stupid rule that there is no table service, or the staff are unwilling to provide a decent service. If they could pick up the customer service as well as be friendly, this place would be a lot better
5
This place will always be in my heart. Cosy, beautiful minimalistic design, bar style café, delicious brunch menus (substantial portions), and most importantly, serves great coffee. Anyone who ask me where to find great coffee anywhere in SG, I would say CSHH. Being a third wave coffee lover, CSHH has a unique setting, keeping external old school while the interior clean chic. Love the small showroom behind the café (with see-through glass) where you are able to buy your accessories and coffee beans straight from CSHH. Knowledgeable and friendly team, it makes you reorder your coffee without realising you might be overdosed! Effect of good coffee that is

Memories of Jacqi from Uk alone in Singapore ,we stayed at Fisher BNB and decided to cross over the road to Chye Seng Huat to enjoy our Count down2016. Reception was very warm people are all in the mood and the live band was just excellent it was not overcrowded withdecent young working adults and some foreigners. We had a great time. You may want to try it out Count down 2017 at Chye Seng Huat for a change. You know what so good, its just across Road
3
Perhaps i had expectations after hearing how good it was. To be honest, cooked food was average, and definitely over priced. Service was fast, but not friendly. Poor choice of words when a server can tell me "Go take yourself'" It could have just been it is self service or you can help yourself over at that corner. Anyway, i would usually return to a place because of the service, more than the food. If you were to visit, you can consider the drinks/coffee and desserts which is value for money and good in quality
4
Nice and cozy interior they offer variety drink food and snack. At the first time came here little bit confius from outside just like old building without any sign a cafe inside. Overall great place good service and good taste, pricey but worthy.
5
A wonderfully whimsical set up which boasts a choice coffee and dessert carte du jour.
Siphoned coffee was truly tantalising! It's clear to see why this idiosyncratic enterprise is as beloved as it is!
5
This hardware shop cook good food and great coffee! Price is a bit expensive but definitely worth it.
I have tried their Salmon Doburi and Ice Latte, love it so much !
Definitely will be back.
5
Dropped by this café for coffee and dessert after lunch at Char Restaurant nearby. The coffee was very good. The place is pretty rustic. Enjoyable.
5
Love the consistency of the coffee and great value breakfast. Will always come back when I realize singapore coffee is not that good.
5
This place has excellent coffee, trust me I'm a coffee enthusiast :) Multiple layers of aroma and flavor in a simple long black. Food is hearty and delicious. Couldn't stop eating the sambal mayo with fries and chicken wings.If you're in the area, make a stop, you won't be disappointed
4
Visited the cafe on a sunny afternoon.Love the breakfast offerings - the portion done just right & fresh & full of flavors.The place is comfortable & bustling with patrons having good conversations.The coffee is very high standard.Especially love the Nuts & Bolts roasting variety.All in all - will come back again
4
We went there because of the good reviews and our hotel was only across the street. It looks not inviting from the outside and I would never have noticed it, the entrance is on the side behind a wall. I had a selection of their pastries (sweet and savoury), they were great! Especially the Nutella banana ones and the curry puffs were to die for! The Coffee was a bit overpriced I think. My boyfriend had one of their warm dishes and was not so happy with it, I guess you better stick to Coffee and pastries at a coffee shop ;) but he had a good gluten free brownie
5
My hubby and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of coffee and the varieties of cakes and local snacks too which includes 'soon kueh' (steam turnip) and 'ang ku kueh' was simply spoilt of choices. I absolutely love the black forrest cake and this is a choice not to missed, especially if you are a black forrest fan! Do enjoy the fries although personally I think it could be better with crinkle cut fries instead. Overall, I feel it is a wonderful place to relax and chill every day! :
4
Know this place from one of Indonesia blogger, not one of the place in the commercial area, bit hiding around hostel and food court nearby. Ordered their long black and at first sip, i got hooked, not sure if it's single origin or their house blend, it was bitter but leave a sour taste at the end without leaving the bad taste in your mouth. It's one of the great coffee i tried, even compare to Australia, i found this better. The food took sometimes to serve, taste is OK, a bit pricey, i didn't try their sweets and cakes. Stroll away from Lavender MRT station, walk toward horne road and just go straight to the end, turn right and 100 meter on the right you'll find the place. Recommended for their coffe.
5
Interior of the cafe is antique outside & very modern inside. Atmosphere of cafe is just perfect with coffee bar & cool light. Especially the latte was just perfect! Miss their coffee already
4
We went there almost every morning while we were in Singapore because our hotel was nearby. The pastries were delicious as well as their coffee. And the old hardware shop with modern decoration was cool. Would definitely drop by again in our next trip there.
4
Would not have guessed that this little chic place serves good breakfast. Had the usual breakfast coupled with the eggs and sausages. Much like ones we have in Australia but cheaper.
4
Great place to have breakfast and coffee. Constantly good quality and friendly service but on the pricey side. Very nice atmosphere to enjoy time. I love their outdoor seating space.
4
Relaxing ans hip environment. Good vibe, service was great at a reaonable price.
Two of us had ang ku kueh, daily brew and a lemonade for less than $10
5
My cousin told me about this coffee shop and we went here with uber. At first, we thought that we were lost because it was not located on the main street. And from outside the building looked like an old apartment. But, when i went inside, i was in love with the vibe and the ambience of this coffee shop. i went there around 3 or 4 pm and it was really crowded and it was really hard to find a seat. I ordered the flat white coffee and it was great! Too bad the kitchen was already closed because I would like to try the food. Overall, it's one of the best coffee shop i've visited in Singapore
5
I make it a point to bring all my guests to Singapore to this humble hardware shop turned coffee haunt. The cold brew here is so damn awesome & on point, I'm yet to find a place that does it better. I hear their food isn't too bad too but I'm yet to try it. I wonder where to start on their menu. All I want is more cold brew! Good lord I do! Come here & leave with memories. You'll be back - Like Arnie!
3
We returned to this breakfast/brunch place after about 2 years and were a little disappointed to see that they had changed their menu. The old menu was way lot better than the current one. We did not have a bad time or anything but it's just that we had way better food here before. The current menu isn't terrible but it isn't anything to brag about either. In fact probably a bit pricey for what it is
5
Heard about this cafe for the longest time and we finally got to visit here. It was actually an old hardware store turned into a coffee place. Tried their nitro coffee and it was so good! The coffee isn't powering yet refreshing. And it was poured as "draft" into a small pint. It is like cold brewed coffee but the caffeine content is way stronger. It is a nice place to chill with friends.
4
Great place, a little small and quite crowded on a weekend. There are seats outside of the cafe but due to the cement area it can be very hot in the afternoon. Should try the special brew...that's the real appreciation of the fragrance and taste of coffee
4
Was there for a Barista Training by Papa Palheta. A Unique Coffee Place housing coffee boutique, a cafe and a roasters. Nice bar concept. Great Ambience & a good cup of cappucino never goes wrong.
4
Found this place through lonely planet, listed as one of the best coffee places in Singapore.The attention to detail and pride in their finished article is outstanding, the first batch did not meet their expectations and was thrown away - don't see that in Costa or StarbucksAtmosphere is great and coffee fab sin$ 6 is maybe a tad steep hence only 4 star
5
I think they are serving best coffee in Singapore (coffee beans roasted by Papa Paletha). Cold brew (7 SGD) is highly recommended, although Latte (6 SGD) is not very good enough (I tried the cold one, maybe the hot one is better).Not got any chance to try their daily brew/manual brew but I think i would try it on another visit. You also can buy Papa Paletha beans behind the coffee shop, they have a room sells coffee beans.Dont judge the coffee shop from the outside (hardware shop), actually its very cozy inside. I think they should make a bigger space because the coffee shop is very famous and crowded
5
After moved to Singapore for working long term, seeking for good coffee shop is the first thing I would like to do. It's really important to me because my day can't start without a good coffee. CSHH is the fist one in my list that I want to try. Review for restaurants in Singapore is a mixed so it's better to trust yourself first and let give anyone a chance.The design is the first impression. When entered the shop, I was surprised by the open, lively and friendly atmosphere behind the door. The coffee bar looks really nice. I often sit around the bar and wait for my hand brew coffee to be done.Outside of the bar is a garden, but I don't recommend to sit there in a hot summer day :)) but anyway it's good place to chill in the night with some fresh and craft beers.Staffs are really nice, young friendly. I would love to see people do hand brew coffee and thanks CSHH for always serving hand brew coffee even it's crowded of people. You know some coffee shop here they will no serve hand brew coffee during weekend or holiday and sometime it made me disappointed a little bit..Food and desserts are quite ok. I come here just for coffee and beer so I will not talk much about the food.Let's talk about coffee. The first thing that I tried was hand brew dripping coffee. Coffee beans are blended in three different tastes: light, balance and bold and the bean would be changed after few months. I can't tell more detail about the taste but overall it is the one of best I have ever tried in Singapore. I love light and balance taste. Coffee will be served with a piece of paper contains the information of the taste, the farm, the bean and also the cropping time. It's interesting because you will know more about what you're drinking.Beside of hand brew coffee, the black cold brew is also nice. Its taste is light, sweet, subtle, not much acidic and very easy to drink with ice. Most of my Vietnamese friends love and enjoy this cold brew from CSHH.Not only coffee, the beer garden here is also a gem that you should try also. Craftsmanship beers are really good and it will take you a lot of time to visit and try all the menu :)) I recommend to drink the classic IPA and the Hazelnut beer. They are my most favourite ones.Nothing is perfect, my taste may not like yours also, but until now it's the best place for me to enjoy coffee in every single day, to chill and drink beer with friends in a Friday night.
4
I was actually seeking out Chye Seng Huat Hardware as a friend told me they have great coffee, and I nearly missed it, as it is very white and unassuming from the outside, but as soon as you step inside the architecture and ambiance is catching. It's open, with a lot of dark metal and rustic details. The latte was delicious, although a bit small, and upon reviewing their menu I was pleasantly surprised to see more than a handful of my hometown Founder's artisanal beers on the menu. They have chill music and a hip crowd. Worth a visit if you like coffee, cafes, and beer gardens. The deserts looked tasty and they appear to have a breakfast, lunch and dinner menu.
5
I am a serious coffee drinker and get truly angry and cranky with bad coffee. It has been a long search for good coffee in Singapore. Friends have recommended and have failed in directing me to good coffee. Anyhow, it was pure coincidence that I stopped by this really cool (hardware-store conversion) cafe. I went in to have a peek at the interesting architecture after yoga (see my review of Yoga in Common... amazing yoga place around the corner) and tasted the best coffee in Singapore. The beans were beautifully roasted, not burnt. The flavour was strong but had no bitter after-taste. The milk was frothy. And the temperature was lovely and hot! The salmon rosti wasn't bad either
4
Stumbled upon this place on the way to my hotel. The coffee is pricey but damn does it taste good and I'm from Melbourne! I went back for more the next day. Friends tried the drip coffee and said it was the best they had in Singapore. Plenty of space if you go before 9.30am however it does get quite busy. They have a shop outback to purchase coffee beans. Plenty of shaded area out doors or you can sit inside on the coffee bar if you need aircon. The place looks and feels like it can be in a laneway in Melbourne. Highly recommend
5
I accidentally found this coffee shop during my way back to hostel. The staff are very friendly and nice. Thanks a male staff who comes to talk with me. Even though the price is quite high, it's worth to pay indeed. I have iced chocolate, it's tasty. I personally highly recommend this place. The staff told me you can see smell coffee as they do coffee roasted.
5
This places makes the most invogirating cold brew coffee that I have ever had in my life. I make sure to take all my out of town visitors here. It's a bit challenging to spot while walking on the street but armed with GPS and a can-do attitude, little is impossible. I've not tried the food here but if their coffee is anything to go by, I'm sure you'll have a damn satisfying meal here.
5
We visited here after reading great reviews. Coffee lives up to expectations. Service was great. Prices were reasonably high, but we have come to expect that in the more western dining cafes/restaurants. We had a flat white and a cold brew, both 10/10/ Lavender (the area this cafÃ© is in) is quite nice too and worth a wander
5
Great coffee. Nuff said.
But I have to write more... Atmosphere, check. Good food, check. Interior design, check. Highly recommend.
5
It's very near to our hotel in Tyrwhitt Road.I'm very in love with their Huat breakfast.The toast and ham is just amazing!Their mocha is so good too!A must drink.Like!
3
Went for coffee and dessert. Coffee is super strong, which is good for me. But my date found it was too powerful for her.
Desserts are ok.
Overall, a solid place but warning: it gets really noisy when crowded.
5
At last we found some great coffee in Singapore. Friendley staff and good atmosphere. Located in a beautiful transformed old hardware store. A litte bit expensive, but its worth it! Excellent coffee!
4
I've bought takeaway coffee several times here and today I managed to get a table with friends and we dined in. Their coffee have always been good for me, but today my cappucino was barely hot, almost lukewarm, which was disappointing. As there was a line at the cashier, I decided not to change. Coffee taste was not compromised but I do like to have a hot cup of coffee. The earl grey cheese cake, sticky fig pudding with vanilla ice cream and pork burger were very good though! That made up for the lukewarm coffee today. Overall, I would definitely revisit, but would have returned a lukewarm coffee in future.
3
Being from Melbourne, this is the kind of place I was hoping for from the outset. The place has good coffee and a really nice environment to sit and enjoy it. The food is just a little too hipster. Larger steaks of ham are a little too much for some people and with a very limited actual hot breakfast menu, there was little else to choose from. Grab a coffee on your way to work ( as long as you don't mind paying 5.5$ for it, a touch of a rip off but got the sense thats the general price in Singapore.
4
I've been to a number of Hipster Cafe joints and was mostly disappointed by 'nice decor, meh food', but Chye Seng Huat is definitely NOT one of those places!My friend and I went on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm, the place was packed but the vibe was great! The place was rather noisy so you do have to yell a bit to communicate but else, the atmosphere is relaxed, chill and the place smells of awesome coffee which is always good.We ordered a hot chocolate, a quiche, and a sticky date pudding. The hot chocolate was pleasant, bit on the sweet side, but still, pretty good.The sticky date pudding was a winner! Comes with honeycomb bits, extra gooey toffee sauce and soft pudding that goes well with everything. Really knock out stuff.Value wise, it's not a cheap place but the food is quite good, the atmosphere is great and it's a fun treat in industrial Lavender area. Sure it's Hipster, but it's proper Hipster and even if you're not a fan of Hipster, you'll enjoy this place a lot
4
Dropped by CSHH for a short tea break, loved the rustic restoration of an old hardware shop, which creates comfortable ambiance of the coffee shop. Guests can choose to sit at the patio outside or inside with bench and table seating. I ordered a cup of espresso with milk plus almond croissant. Coffee was fragrant and well balanced with milk maintaining an unique flavor. The almond crust of the croissant was crunchy but not too sweet, definitely goes well with the coffee. Passed by CSHH again in the evening where a private event was held, with live music, the venue indeed is a great idea for private gathering
4
Don’t let the name fool you, this ain’t just any hardware store. It’s one chic coffee bar, taking the name Chye Seng Huat Hardware from an actual hardware store that occupied this very space. The cafe serves amazing breakfast to start the day, and the bar is open if you want to end the day on a more chilled note

Always wanted to pop by this place but could not find it. This time around it was just opposite the hotel I stayed. Cake is okay and espresso base coffee is decent but not memorable one. Hand brewed coffee here is definitely not for me. It would be better if the girl who came to clear the table has had asked properly. Nothing to shout about other than just the ambiance.
4
This place like no other in singapore offers a cup of decent coffee and serves it in an adequate premises. I would give full score if the staff wasnt this slowed down and didnt forget an item from my order.
4
Interesting name for a cafe but the place is constantly crowded! Food is not bad and cakes are nice too! Hard to find seats as well as parking space though!

Good coffee. The Huat breakfast is pretty standard, not unique, the thick toast that came with it was kind of hard. Staff were friendly and smiley, good atmosphere. The mushroom breakfast was tasty. Chocolate cake was soft and moist.
4
Went to Chye Seng Huat for lunch on a Friday. Pasta is tasty, hot latte taste good. Just a little issue, 6 of us had to sit at the bar like counter as there's little indoor seats and was full. The chairs a little bit too high.Overall the ambience n the meal is enjoyable.was informed that they change menu every 4months, we will be back to try the new menu
4
A cozy and nice place to lay back, relax and enjoy a cup of coffee. You can witness the barista how to perform a cup of coffee such as hand brew if you happen to sit at the counter table. They also sell roast their own speciality coffee bean and coffee accessories. Coffee drink was good.Highly recommended for a visit ☺
4
You might just drive pass this coffee joint if you don't pay close attention thinking it's closed. We enjoyed our latte and some dessert. Nothing out of the ordinary for the grub, but the place has a pleasant ambience. Great effort in restoring the place and add a charm to the neighborhood.

I met a friend here for brunch. The outside held so much potential, but sadly an interior designer has obviously been told to replicate a look and failed.Chairs are dreadfully uncomfortable.The coffee is lukewarm, the taste is there, but the heat isn't, so it defeats the object. I heard it was because they didn't want to scald customers lips. Hmm. Now, I LOVE eggs benedict, and when I saw it on the extra menu, I immediately ordered it. When it came, at first glance it looked great, two eggs, muffin, home-made hollandaise..but wait, what was this? A 1cm think slice of some reformed ham or something. Not good at all. Spam?! Anyway, go and sit outside, then you can admire the period architecture, and peer into the roasters. Then again, there are no waitresses and waiters, you have to queue at the till to order and get a flag for your seat.I won't be going again. Common Man is much better and although busy with ex-pats, has excellent coffee...and perfect eggs benedict

We were lucky enough to be staying across the street from CSHH. The place itself is very hip and has a dope vibe. I felt like I was back in SF or Brooklyn with the cool,minimalist industrial atmosphere. Cold brew is one a kind and the lattes are perfection! One of the guys working there was so nice he gave us an espresso for free to taste AND their nitro coldbrew which blew my mind. This is def worth your time and a visit. The coffee game in Singapore is strong just like the coffee itself. Very impressed with this place!!!
4
Came here for an early lunch today. This place takes its coffee very seriously and there are a range of interesting options to try. The espresso plus milk option seems to be the closest to a cappuccino and was quite decent. Food isn't cheap but is quite tasty. The smoked salmon rosti being especially noteworthy.
5
I came to find CSHH because of their cold brew and it was indeed amazing! Just what I needed after a long day of walking around. Around noon it was quite busy, but afterwards it calmed down and was a really enjoyable place to hang out. There are even seats outside, but it is so hot, that my cool coffee would be lukewarm in a matter of minutes. Maybe in the evenings.The place/street is too far away from the center, which means it will not be easy to find if you are old school like me with a paper map, but if you have wifi access and tablet/smartphone, or ask people (this is what I did and ended up going those 4 locals I asked to have coffee together) for directions, then you will also be able to enjoy some really decent cold brew ^-
5
Great coffee, great setting, lovely staff! This cafe is a few minutes walk from Jalan Besar and about a 7 minute walk from Lavender station. A real find, even if the area is a bit odd. Worth the visit though - good food as well.
4
hiding behind a non-descriptive shopfront hides a gem. CSHH offers a good varieties of coffee for caffeine addicts. they too served pretty good meals to go along with the drinks.
the second floor holds Papa Palheta, where they offer coffee brewing courses.
3
Heard so much about this cafe, thought i give it a try when i was in Sg. hard to find but coffee is really good
5
Architecturally aesthetic and minimalistic. Awesome environment for chit-chat or a casual business discussion. A perfect dating place if there isn't a crowd.
3
Cute place in a quiet part of the neighborhood. Coffee was decent but i was a little annoyed that the girl taking my coffee order found it necessary to highlight that a 3oz white is a very "strong" dose, and that my filter coffee is served on its own without sugar or milk- the obvious need not be highlighted in such a "matter-of-fact" manner. The banana bread was tasty and wait staff were friendly and attentive. I liked that one of the barista's explained the flavor profile and origins of my filter coffee and came back for feedback after i finished. Plus!
3
Decided to check out this place after so bored with coffee bean /Starbucks. The ambience was quite hip, deco was industrial feel but the foods are definitely overpriced. Drinks prices are almost equivalent to other cafes but not the food.It's the X generation hangout place
3
Today after lunch, we wandering around looking for coffee in the area and found this one. The decorations indoor and outdoor looks very nice. The music wasn't too loud. Those were the only two nice things about here. We decided to try ;2 Flat White (Espresso with milk). It wasn't hot as its supposed to be. In fact, it was lukewarm and almost cold. The barista clearly doesn't know how to estimate right temperature which hot water needed to heat up to 94 Celsius. Oh my.. you guys didn't know that? 1 Butter duo with chocolate cake wasn't cook properly. It was still wet and jelly as you could see in the pictures. It reminds me of my first batch of practice in baking few years ago. I didn't bake the cake on the right temperature and timing wasn't set right. My first failure cake that went to the bin looks exactly just like the one I got today. When your bake batch came out not right which you can see by your own eyes. You shouldn't served it to customer. Bake a new proper one.. Cake Flour very cheap here. We paid 16$ for lukewarm coffees and failure bake of cake. It was kinda wasted. This is the first coffee shop that I have to wait to order and pay at the counter and then standing to wait for my coffees to bring it to my table. At least you should give us a number stand and those many staffs could bring it over when it's ready. We are not so impressed with overall and definitely wouldn't be return.
4
This is a one stop coffee shop. They sell coffee beans, coffee machines, grinders and everything involving coffee. The coffee is nice but it is not cheap. My wish is that they should also include a soy option for their lattes. WillI return, the answer is yes.
5
I found a place where coffee taste so good due to the interior and the environment of the shop. There is a air con seating areas as well as a outdoor seating area. Not forgetting there is also a backyard bench for u to relax on a afternoon with a book alone or catching up with friends. Located just behind Lofi Inn Hostel, Pillow talk hostel
4
The interior of Chye Seng Huat cafe is good, and have nice ambiance. Good for couple or friends. Side tables were a little too small, kind of awkward when 2 normal size men sitting facing each other when eating. The legs of the men actually touched if they did not slant side way.The coffee I've tried was regular size of espresso + milk. Good coffee but it didnt leave any memorable taste after the drink was finished. However, will go there again to try on the food
4
Is always crowded...but worth trying...had coffee n earl grey cheese cake which was reasonable in price n great taste..
Saw some main course served n looks yummy. ...
Nice place to laze n gossips with friends. ..
5
we ate there a few times - excellent food - very cheap.
there was about 6 places to choose, the best one was the sea food .
4
Serve very nice coffee. Great place for hang out but bear in mind the the place can be very crowded during the weekends.
5
Best coffee I had in Singapore. It has a good body and depth, acidity just nice. They also serve these baby friands which are pretty good too. Totally recommend it if you pass by Jalan Besar.

This place takes its hipster credentials really seriously. Housed in what used to be a small old hardware workshop, it's been repurposed as a lifestyle cafe and retail outpost in the middle of an old part of Singapore.There are few places like this with such a nondescript entrance and neighborhood that you'd think its cult following must be on to something. I always leave the place slightly unimpressed. The coffee is decent but I feel that it's overhyped. The baristas do take great pains but I much prefer another smaller independent coffee place called Assembly on Evans Road near the Botanics. If I have to trek for my next cuppa, I'll be headed there.They don't even have soy in this place or any other lactose free alternative to fresh milk which really limits your options if you're lactose intolerant. The food and cakes available are even more unimpressive than the coffee. The furniture is all pretty make shift and uncomfortable to be honest.Come here if you're a victim of the hype and want to see what all the chatter is about. But measure your expectations first. It's not bad but it ain't all what it's made out to be either
4
Interesting name and concept to have a hardware store turned into a coffee place. The old school decor inside gave the place a nice ambiance. The design outside is nice too, i particularly like the giant ants art installation. I sat outside to have my cup of coffee, but got stung by a mosquito multiple times
4
Celebrated my Bday here and been a regular at this place for years now. Simply love the ambience (the nuts and bolts create a rusty look), the food is delicious (but be prepared to pay a little more than usual) and the coffee just makes my day
5
Recommended by my aunt for lunch. Was surprised to find such a well designed and comfortable place. It seems like they toast their own beans and various brewing methods. Food was good too. Am very intrigued on how they make the pork burger so juicy. Definitely coming back again to try other stuffs tho food menu seems a bit limited.
4
This cafe is located some distance away on the opposite side of the ICA building at Lavender MRT station. Walk alongside Jalan Besar stadium on Horne road then turn right into Tyrwhitt road.The lighting in the cafe is dim giving it a very cosy atmosphere, with jazz music playing in the background adding a lazy and relaxing vibe. I ordered cold brew for $7 which is just coffee and sugar in a bottle with a glass of ice. Normally I prefer milk with my coffee, but the mild taste exclude the tinge of bitterness you would expect drinking it without milk.I left soon after as the cafe closes at 7pm. Friendly staff saying goodbye to the customers beside the door was a nice touch to complete my evening
4
I love this place more and more everytime I visit it. Unfortunately, not very often as it is a little inaccessible for me, as I do not drive. The people here are coffee connoisseurs. You HAVE TO try any coffee related drinks here. The coffee is award winning, and after tasting it, you'd understand why. They even have an Annex, a special room where you can get acquainted with all sorts of coffee beans and method of preparation. You'd pass it while passing by the toilet. Check it out then! The food is great too. I had salmon with pancakes and they were yummy. It is filling and the portion is big. The cakes are creatively named. I saw one named "othello"- it was half chocolate pound and half butter cake. Very quirky and humorous of them! The prices are fine and they are of quality. It definitely complements the coffee. I like this place most for the layout of the cafe and the wonderful, cosy ambience of it. You can just spend a lazy weekday here, sipping coffee and surfing the Internet. The staff and servers running this place are also very friendly and helpful. We've got a great team here <3 There's so much more nice things to say about this cafe, but I suppose my most important sentence would have to be: Come here to experience it yourself
3
Wouldn't be known of this so called "hardware shop cum cafe restaurant" that offer fine coffee and western delicacies.
5
This part of town is definitely Singapore’s next hotspot! Cool cafes hidden in between hardware shops and old-school food options at various streets, this is where you hang out with the cool kids.
5
i like there concept hence the name Hardware. Interior is cool and they have good coffees and tempting sweets. Upstairs also pretty awesome. You will like it. You have to walk bit from Lavender MRT station but its worth.
4
Just love the coffee beans here and they serve very fragrant coffee. Had visited so many cafes around the city, however I'll always prefer CSHH. Ambience wise really nice and lively. Been visiting it almost very week for the past 1 year plus i guess, it has became part of my habitual lifestyle
4
I have been to this place a few times and i love it here! The place is really nice, quite (when its not rush hour) and did I mention the coffee is much much better than other places! I went to a lot of other places that serve 'coffee' which taste nothing but milk. So i'm really glad finally found a good decent coffee in Singapore. The service was amazing, everyone is so fast and attentive which is one of the reason why I always come back. The food was good, they change the menu sometimes, I have tried a few different menu and they are not bad. Overall it is a good place to have brunch and good cuppa coffe
4
Heard a lot about the place and decided to try it out. Loved the environment of the small but cozy interior. for a large group of 7 it was a tad difficult to grab a spot and we asked one of the male waiter to help us find a spot but all he did was say this place is 'free seating' concept and didn't bother with us. however, we were later served by a friendly girl waiter.Food wise, I just had a typical big breakfast (sausages, scrambled eggs, hams) and hot chocolate. only drawback was the hot chocolate not being warm at all. Still it is a great place for friend meets and small talks in its huddled corners
2
Pros - cool location, hipster design Cons - coffee is tiny! Very tiny! Food is seriously mediocre. Queues for order and have to collect ownSo many good cafes in SG and csh is differentiating itself as a disappointment. Go round the corner to Bravery if you are in Japan besar or go to Rangoon road for so many more quality choices.

My friend saw a review from Ladyironchef’s blog about Chye Seng Huat Hardware and we decided to go there. The place was quite near with our hostel at Lavender Street, so we can go there by foot.At the front, you’ll see a signage and a broken white gate. The outdoor seating area was huge with small ants’ figures on their wall. The wooden table and chairs were nice. Design-wise, this place was good for a shot for Instagram. Go inside to order some coffee and have a cooler ambiance with dim light and strong scent of coffee. The Chye Seng Huat Hardware coffee shop was only at the lower ground, which I found that they have 2nd and 3rd floor for another tenant.We went up and see an art & craft workshop named General Company. You’ll find porcelain plates, wooden case, leather wallet and bags made by paper. Cool stuffs! Make sure you go to check it on their 2nd floor. I didn't order anything, but I explore the spot and enjoy the scent of their roasted coffee
3
My first visit to CCSH, I had latte which was great. So impressed we ordered a second cup. Ordered strawberry cheese cake which was a strawberry cake (muffin textured) with cream cheese icing over. The cake was just alright.Our 2nd visit, we ordered latte take-out. The taste was disappointingly. Coffee tasted flat and there wasn't the creaminess of the milk. One sip was all I could take :( Will think twice before heading over in future
4
I have been trying out different brunch places week after week and was looking for something with an edge. This place certainly did not disappoint - I found the concept of maintaining the original hardware store exterior very charming. There's some witty deco going on with mention of 'Kopi Annan' residing in the backyard :PDefinitely not for people that are looking to wind down in peace & quiet. The place is crowded on the weekends and very noisy. Seats are not comfortable and designed for you to leave soon after you finish your coffee/meal. I really loved the chicken stew I had, it was something different from the usual brunch and went great with tabasco (I'm addicted to tabasco. Heard this was a privately owned; the family must be swimming in money). Reminded me of Chicken soup for the soul. I'm no coffee connoisseur so can't comment much on that but my companion who's super picky with coffee approved. 
3
Yes, the coffee is good, but I think there are other cafes with equally good coffee. I would prefer cafes that are quiet and quaint. This place is too crowded and noisy for my liking.
5
CSHH is the coolest coffee shop in the city. Serving their own awesome Papa Palheta coffee, ice cold beer and a few interesting food choices, this was one of my favorite places to hang out in SG.
5
Made a bee-line to Chye Seng Huat Hardware after a long morning walking around Little India. Great coffee, yummy snacks. No need to eat in and deal with the crowds. Grab and go look at some amazing architecture in the neighborhood.
3
Unique place where owners converted a hardware shop into a coffee museum. Huge coffee roasting machines and other equipments can be seen opposite the cafe. Coffee was above average and desserts were average.
4
We have been here twice now and as residents in Singapore we would put this in our top three coffee establishments in this small city. The bean variety is good with the house blend nice and strong. The brewing methods they have on offer are what you would expect from a decent cafe.They have a roasting room and workshop on the grounds with a small shop for coffee connoisseurs to which sells all kinds of barristers gadgets and also offers courses on the subject
4
A former Hardware store turned into a great coffee shop. Just around the corner from Little India and across the street from a lovely Tibetan Temple. Meeting friends for Sunday brunch the place was packed. You order at the counter and take a number. We all ordered one of the set breakfasts and mine was yummy. Coffee was excellent and my friends have done the coffee tastings there which is in a separate room
4
A good friend brought me here for brunch. What a great example of adaptive reuse! An old hardware store turned hip eatery. Food was fantastic (western cuisine). Decor was very cool with bric-a-brac from another era. Upstairs is a cool store that sold designed in Singapore goods with a sprinkling of foreign made items. A little off the beaten path but definitely a worth a visit.
4
Place is crowded but it seems to be dispersing as I arrived late evening at 6-ish. Shame that the hot food kitchen closed at 5pm everyday or else I would love to fill my empty tummy with some savoury. Pastry and cakes selection seem dull and doesn't look attractive. But the coffee definitely make up for it. Famous for their cold brew and special hand brew. Ask for recommendations from their lovely and friendly crew. Will definitely be back, I hope
3
Went to this place after hearing good reviews about the coffee. Ordered the Huat breakfast (Toast, eggs, ham, sausages, tomato, mashed potatoes) and expresso with milk. As others have mentioned, you order your food and drinks at the cashier and you have to wait for your coffee and they give you a number for your food. Created quite a queue at the counter as there was not a different area for collection of your coffee. Not sure why they couldn't just deliver your coffee since they have already given you a number for your food..The coffee was ok, but got cold very fast...the breakfast set ordered was good. Atmosphere was ok, but difficult to find space inside the cafÃ© as it got really crowded and some spaces were quite cramp. Overall not a bad experience, but limited choices
3
This was our second visit and I suddenly remembered what had annoyed us on our first visit. Okay I don't mind queuing up to order food and coffee. However you have to then stand and wait for the coffee, you receive it and take it to your table (which is too small and the wooden seats uncomfortable). For $5.50 the coffee is a rip off when you see how small the cups are. So it takes us only a few gulps and we finish our coffee before the food even arrives. My husband wanted another coffee with his meal so seeing my meal was not really a hot meal, I go and queue up. The queue moves very slowly so before I even get to order, my husband appears as he has finished his meal, so he queues while I go and eat. By the time my husband returns, I have finished my meal. Ridiculous, we couldn't even eat together, just to get a second coffee!The menu is unusual with very limited breakfast choice. I had seared tuna which was beautiful but it came on a bed of lettuce and a poached egg.....it's not what I wanted for breakfast but there is very little egg choices. On a positive note, the staff are very nice, and the coffee was creamy and hot, shame about the size though.
4
Super good coffee and excellent food. Place a bit crowded but overall atmosphere was relax. A good place to chillax with friends
4
Interesting coffee place in Singapore. The facade of a hardware store and the name would make people wonder what's inside. They have excellent brunch menu and their coffee is quite good.
5
A really nice place, although a bit off the regular destination for tourist / visitor. But if you love coffee, you definitely need to go.
5
The best craft coffee bar in Singapore, loved everything about this place, a workshop and a designer homeware and gift shop upstairs, hours of fun. Closed Mondays though.
4
Love the coffee and chocolate bar. Nice décor. Friendly staff. They helped us with places to eat/visit. Sat by the bar to watch them prepare the coffee.
5
The coffee here is very, very good especially the latte and cold brew. We are picky coffe-holics and were very impressed.
4
We stayed at a hostel on Tyrwhitt Street and stumbled across an unassuming hardware store. To our surprise, the hardware store had been transformed into a coffee shop. The coffee shop was beautifully decorated and furnished: there was a lovely sitting area outside with gorgeous plants and cacti (for when it is not so hot!), and an air-conditioned interior artfully decorated to maintain the integrity of the hardware store the premise probably once housed.The coffee was delicious, although slightly on the expensive side ($7.00 for an iced latte). Although we were pleased with our drinks, I was a little disappointed to find that they did not carry different types of milk (such as soy) and sweetener (such as honey or agave). For such a specialist coffee place, you would expect them to want to cater to different dietary requirements
5
We were lucky enough to stay at a hotel nearby. So instead of being bummed out by a mediocre breakfast at the hotel we ventured into the city to find a place to start the day at. We went straight past it for the first days, being missled by the unassuming exterior. Of course there are other joints offering a wider range of coffee and nosh, the people at CSHH seemingly dont want to compete with them. What sets them apart is the cool, yet totally relaxed atmosphere, and their obvious dedication to both product and customers. Awesome place
4
"Chye Seng Huat Hardware".. don't let the facade of a hardware store & the name of the shop deceive you. The front entrance is closed with shutters but when you proceed to enter from the side, it is a coffee house. It is a fine place to hang out. I had the butter croissant (my favourite comfort food!).. it is one of the best I've tasted so far.My friend had the Almond Croissant.. a little bit too sweet to my liking.The ambience is just right for family/friends to hang out
4
I bring some of my friends here because of 3 reasons: 1. Coffee is great, 2. Food is good and 3. the Ambience is unique. When I first saw this place it really didn't look anything like a coffee shop. However the moment I stepped in I realized that this is a really great place for coffee
5
Seems like any other typical hardware store on the road but do not be misled! Food and beverages are top-notch
5
Love the taste and presentation :) Also, the location and how it does not look like a coffee shop fr the outside :)
5
My casual brunch spot during my visit to SG. Good coffee and brunch that never fail to impress me. Recommended to reach earlier for the indoor seating.
3
If ya near by, this place serves a decent cuppa. Origins are from Melbourne and they are known to be the one of the better coffee joints in Singapore but there are a lot of good joints and these days in Singapore! We are blessed!
4
after taking kok kee wanton mee @ lavendar food square on 17.9.2014, we decided to walk over to chye seng huat hardware at tyrwhitt road for our cuppa. the cafe CSHH coffee bar was located on the ground floor of a building with the name chye seng huat hardware and a cool shophouse facade.the interior was a nice chill-out ambience. at 430pm there were quite many customers but not full & we sat at a corner wall with a ledge & tall stools & a wall mirror so you could see the whole cafe when sat facing the mirror.the coffee flavour was good & the frothed milk was velvety smooth & combined well with the coffee.i had 2 really great cuppas during my recent stay in london – one was at monmouth cafe in covent gardens on 22.8.2014, and the other when we stopped for a cuppa at melrose & morgan during our walk along regent’s canal to primrose hill on 24.8.2014.a nice coffee makes all the difference. for me, CSHH cafe bar’s flat white falls into that good cuppa category
4
Was recommended by a friend for good coffee here. An interesting and trendy atmosphere, fitting for serious coffee drinkers. Service was typically singaporean - awkward and "unexpressive" so I cant blame them. Coffee blend was really good, I had one from Tanzania and South America, nutty but not bitter. Unfortunately, barista has trouble understanding a long mac, we come to a compromise that its a long black with some milk on top
5
I lived in Singapore for 4 years and this place had the best coffee during that entire time.....a coming from Melbourne I have high expectations.Always served up excellent coffee and I went daily as I lived only 5 minutes away at City Square. Frustratingly busy on the weekends, but at least you know you will be happy.I only ate there a couple of times and it was nothing special, but the pastries are good. Here it is all about the coffee and it is done wel
4
This coffee house is hidden in a small courtyard, with no clear indication but a hardware board. Once inside, the smell of the coffee is the first thing that impresses you. The decoration is modern and rather industrial, which is very interesting.But, as said, the most pleasant aspect of my visits (twice) was the coffee; the guys there know their stuff, like real baristas.The food choice varies from croissants or muffins to herb omelettes with tomatos and is delicious.Price is reasonable and the terrace is quiet
4
This hidden cafe 15 minutes away from lavender mrt is a must visit for baristas and coffee lovers. They have their own roaster and the coffee is amazing. Have a sip of their cold brew on a hot day and just chill out. Like guiness? Then order a glass of their tap coffee they call nitro black matter
2
This is a very cool place, no doubt about it, love the music and the bar set up. The menu doesn't really offer much, and if you don't really drink coffee, it doesn't offer you much alternatives. I ordered the Spring Onion Cakes, but instead of scrambled eggs, I asked for Poached Eggs (I always find chefs over cook scrambled eggs in Singapore), but I was told that would cost $4 extra. You are kidding me right. Outrageous cheek that is. I am a chef, and how they think that is acceptable is beyond me. Yep, and the scrambled eggs were over cooked... shame
4
Nice decor that looks vintage. I couldnt find the entrance door got to look hard enough...food wise was average but will recommend for ambience
3
Love the decor but coffee we had were normal and not enough space to sit. Would recommend guys who love atmosphere to try.
3
Had thought of going there for breakfast since it was not too far from the hotel I was staying at in the area and it was the only one open at 9 a.m. The place was mispinned on Google Maps (it's on the opposite side), but found it anyway. The logical front door doesn't work so you have to go around the side for entry. Didn't stay to eat (there wasn't anything I wanted at the time), only took some pictures and left
3
located near the heart of jalan besar stadium, don't be fooled by the warehouse exterior look which actually houses a rather hip coffee joint indoors coffee is meticulously prepared by the barista though the pastries/coffee selections are rather limited. The cheesecake I tried is called goat's cheesecake which tastes a bit different from conventional cheesecake. Perhaps can check out the pasta or waffles which might be a better dea
3
A quaint little joint : very creatively set-up...a coffee joint, set-u in an old hardware store, with much of the hardware still around and lending a unique atmosphere and ambiance to the place. There's a young, yuppie feel here : the wait staff are young and spirited, and many of the clients are young, not overly-trendy executives. The only problem is you have to get here early, cos they shut early each day (I think around 7 or 7.30pm)

Chye Seng Huat Hardware Cafe is a very interesting concept, for a hardware store to branch out into the cafe business, but hey, everyone's heading there so it was inevitable that I have to be there too. One could choose to sit outdoors (mind you, outdoor seating is full if one comes on a weekend!).Or one could head inside and sit amongst the cosy interior with its wooden bar counter, round wooden stools and surrounded by many hardware items on display (mounted on walls and decorating the countertops).*Edgar and I snagged a tiny table in the crowded cafe and took a "gold-plated" menu with us. Frankly, the table was too small and the chairs were not really comfortable. Plus the cafe was crowded so it was not really an ideal place for chilling out for long, long hours (*Edgar was nearly butt to butt with the person sitting behind him at the table next to us!).We both tried their famous Cold Brewed Coffee (SGD$7.00), served in bottles that resembled cough medicine bottles. Being adventurous, I tried to drink without the milk and sugar syrup at first, but the taste was kind of bitter, with a strong sour aftertaste. I guess this is what "pure-ness" is all about, but to me it was an acquired taste that needed getting used to. In the end we both emptied all the milk and sugar syrup into the coffee to make it sweeter and more likeable.I had the Ham & Cheese French Toast (SGD$15.00) which tasted good. The french toast slices were crispy around the edges, and the sweet flavor of butter with beaten egg was easily detected. Combined with melted cheese, tender ham, sweet tomato slices and sprigs of rocket salad, this made for a good and satisfying meal.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/06/brunch-at-chye-seng-huat-hardware-cafe.htm

The coffee here is robust and strong and a good kicker to keep ya engine running for the day.Had their big breakfast set and its pretty average but at least the portions fit the price. Would come back for the coffee but not food.A nice chillout place with friends and colleagues if you are in the Jalan Besar area
4
Nice open concept where you can see the baristas at work. This place was packed on a Friday afternoon. No sign of a crowd from the exterior until we stepped in. Tried the hand drip karatu estate brew. Full body with a sweet aftertaste. The carrot cake though small, was moist and nice. This place sells coffee accessories and runs workshops too
5
Went there with my hubby. Love the concept & that they are still maintaining the shop's name.we ordered cold brew coffee. Not to my liking. Shld have just ordered an espresso with milk. Staffs are all very friendly & helpful. Nice place to chill with friends and families.
4
on first look, it looks like an old shop house/warehouse. Behind those heavy metal gates, its actually a gem! pretty crowded on a public holiday around 4pm. old school tables on the alfresco site and i love the raw modernistic indoor look. Have to try the raspberry cheesecake! its delectable! love the base crust of it! the espresso+milk (latte?) was smooth and aromatic especially with the fine brown sugar added. saw on the menu they actually serves all day breakfast, french toast etcoverall: a cool place for a bite and chat

Excellent place for its environment and coffee. Only downside is how packed it can get in the weekends. Still, fantastic place with nice music too! I personally loved the live jazz band and the use of the space outdoor.

A cozy cafe with a very ordinary facade. Food was ok price was reasonable. On crowded day you can't really sit down for long. People will be standing beside you waiting for you to finish eating.

A strange place for a great cafe, but I guess that's part of the attraction. Tucked away in a street of clan houses and (Former) light industrial, this place still retains the facade (literally) of its former incarnation as a hardware shop.Coffee is brewed on site and is excellent. The sweet treats are mostly delicious (avoid the brownies though) and the philly cheesesteak sandwich, while it has little in common with what's sld in Philadelphia, is delicious

After visiting and finding it closed on a Monday, this time, on a Saturday, the place was buzzing. Bar top tables are packed close together. You can sit at the bar too but the most comfortable are the seats that put you at the right height for a meal. Food is good though we only tried breakfast. And so is the coffee. The decor gives you something to look at and there are newspapers for those who don't their company interesting

Get to know about this cafe from my colleagues. I brought my gf there and she love this place! my gf ordered blinis with smoked salmon while I had the tuna melt sandwich! the smoked salmon was not very salty and it goes really well with the blinis! furthermore, being a tuna lover, i love the tuna melts sandwich! highly recommended

We were not very hungry. We wanted a light something and coffee. Saw some excellent salads and open sandwiches being served. The place was teeming full. Meantime, we bought some house blend and another espresso coffee for home in the Annex A. They sell coffee machines and fresh beans or will grind for you and pack in vacuum sealed bags.We were just lucky to get two seats inside. Turnaround is fast. Being a weekend it was very busy. You have to order at the counter, they serve at your table. The wait for food was 30 minutes. So we had some excellent fig baclava, shared a cookie and espresso. It was a treat. Place has been retained like a hardware store - entrance and front, is not at all of a cafe. It is at the corner of Lavender and Jln Besar.Great passing experience. Will go again if in the area for coffee and cakes & pastries. Physical space is tight. Find a corner for yourself and just switch off from the buzz in the midst of the din

I went in by what looked like the back gate of a shop to a very very crowded late afternoon crowd. I think this place is crowded no matter what time of the day.There was no cafe mocha, flat white, latte in the menu. Know your coffee before you order! I didn't know so simply tried the brew of the day and cold coffee. It was interesting comparing the two as different brewing methods brought out such contrasting textures to beans!Loved the food! Had fish and cake. Its hard to imagine a coffee place serving good food. Fish tended to the salty side but I liked the taste. Desserts are MUST

A rather unremarkable exterior, reminiscent of an old-time shophouse that is closed, the entrance is actually on the gate to the left of the closed doors marking 'Chye Seng Huat Hardware'.Without any prior knowledge of this cafe, one might overlook it as an old closed down shophouse. But upon entering, the 'chill' atmosphere and rather simple decor relaxes the customer immediately. The selection of coffee is impeccable as well. You can have a choice of 4 different roasts/brews, dripped for you on the spot to enjoy within about 10 minutes. Or you could go for a nice latte or regular americano which is carefully prepared. Breakfast/brunch is great here. Great choices aplenty. I had a chicken wrap, which was surprisingly appropriate even for breakfast. Quaint, relaxing, but somewhat pricey. But it's definitely worth it for a good coffee experience.They have coffee tasting sessions on some days, along with classes for coffee preparation. Just check the website out for all these!Highly recommend this place to anyone. One of the best cafes I've been to

Located in an old largely commercial part of town and completely nondescript-looking from the outside, once you enter its premises, a really hip place where coffee is taken seriously. This means everything from serving all kinds of beans and blends, various brew types, to even Barista classes and Latte Art Workshops. The roasting and blending is done on the premises in a separate viewable room, where you can see the antique (but upgraded internally) German roasting machines at work. Food (pastries, all day breakfast type) is also offerred and is also tasty and worth trying

From the outside, it looks as if this is just another hardward store but once you get in, you will be greeted by a relaxed vibe, cool deco and a fairly young crowd enjoying good coffee. The coffee here is not all that great but they sure do put a lot of effort into making it. Not a bad place to spend an afternoon

The signage said Chye Seng Huat Hardware but it is a very quaint and interesting coffee shop.Initially, I thought it was a traditional coffee shop or kopi tiam as we local called them. This is a modern westernized coffee shop with baristas, serving expresso based coffee, four kinds of hot tea, light food and pastries. There are two serving areas, one is an indoor air conditioned area where a big oval shape coffee station and cashiers are.The other sitting area is outdoor in the old courtyard which would be a perfect place to gather a few friends for coffee and chit chats from late evenings and into the night.I will visit this place again as to me, it is quaint and a great place to relax with a nice cup of coffee, people watch and do nothing

The signboard will make you think that you're entering a hardware shop, but in reality, you'll see a long line of people queuing up for coffee.The cafe's nice, service decent (you can't really mess up a self service outlet), and the food's great. It has an interesting ambience, and the coffee's pretty good. When it gets crowded though, the atmosphere just goes out the window. Also, go upstairs to visit a shop which sells quirky bags, locally published books, and miscellaneous items such as iPad casings

If you love your coffee, chances are you'll love those from Papa Palheta. And Papa Palheta is what they serve here. It's the BEST in Singapore and the folks behind the counter know how to brew it just right. As I saw nearly everyone ordering food, I did too. But what a mistake it was. Talk about over-priced and under-whelming eggs and sausages... the turnaround for the pastries wasn't very quick so I avoided ordering any of them. Having said that about the F&B, I do love the deco though the high chairs aren't the most comfortable. The high tables are also TINY and we had a bit of trouble trying to fit all the F&B on our wee little table. Unfortunately, there aren't very many "normal" table and chairs... if you're looking for a comfy and soothing to place to chill-out, this isn't the place. The acoustics are harsh inside and when it's crowded, it ends up being very noisy. Outside, well, it's Singapore, so that means it's hot and humid. If that's your thing, then you'll be fine.What's good about the place (after you find it, that is), is that there's a roasting room there and a separate coffee-tasting room. In fact, you can even go on their coffee tour. I didn't sign up for that so can't give any feedback on it... Overall, is it worth hunting this place down? I'd say, if you're in the neighbourhood and love Papa Palheta's coffee, then yes. At least once, just to experience it

On account of a recommendation, I decided to try this quirky little cafe off Lavender Street. This cafe is distinguishable by its iron gates, with outdoor and indoor seats. I loved the ambience, which gave off a very casual feel, no rush, no fuss! You place your food and drink orders at the counter, pay up and carry your drinks to the table. If food is expected, they will be brought to your table by the wait staff, otherwise there is nothing much in the way of service to speak of. I was just a little annoyed that the kitchen closes at 5pm, which in my opinion is a tad too early. I also hope that the hot beverages will eventually be served in larger cups. The seared Dory fillet was tasteful, but the slices could be thicker, considering its price. But nonetheless, this is a lovely little quiet place that has found its niche with the coffee-joint crowd

After hearing about CSHH from friends, we decided to check it out yesterday afternoon. Its one of those places where you kinda have to know its there or walking by, you'd probably miss it. It's kept its original exterior and signage - hell they even kept the name. If you have a problem remembering names, good luck. Once inside, its got a nice, easy vibe with the right amount of quirky. Ordered a latte and a friend had a dry cappucino with a pain au chocolat and a teacake. Coffees were good but I expected them to be much better with them being a coffee roaster etc. Pastries were just ok, a little dry. The barista who served us was very knowledgeable and chatted to us as we sat at the bar. He certainly knew his stuff and remade the capuccino when my friend mentioned his wasn't up to scratch. Decent, engaging service is a bit of a rarity in Singapore, so a plus point here. Price wise it was reasonable as cafes go. I think its a good neighbourhoody place but unless I was already in the area or close to it, not sure I'd make the trip there just for the coffee. It ain't all that

Food and coffee too ordinary - looks like they are just to cash in on the cafe bandwagon. The sandwich seems to be made with the gardenia bread - what i would whip up at home for a simple meal. It is way too crowded for my liking. We had to share a tabl

I took a friend from out of town here over the weekend and we were impressed. Once you enter its quite modest external facade, you are immediately immersed in a sea of activity and buzz. The expresso and house coffee (Nuts and Bolts) are both wonderful - strong but smooth with intricate latte art by the skilled baristas. There is a nice selection of desserts (didn't try the other menu items) to go with coffee. However, we were told there are no decaffeinated options...not a big deal for us though. There is a separate Annex where you can buy whole beans, get info on classes, and where there is limited seating (maybe 5 people at a small bar) for a cup of your choice

I waited about half an hour in the queue...realising that it could take another half atleast to have the food on the table, i decided to leave. I came here to sample their famous coffee while having sunday breakfast. Maybe better luck next time. Attention management - if you know you're busy, do something about it!!! You'll lose customers in the long term...

CSHH is a fantastic little cafe by the people behind Papa Palheta. It's speakeasy entrance in a quiet street lined with hardware stores makes it entirely possible that you walk around in circles the first time you visit. Once inside though, you're greeted by the industrial-chic decor and it'll only be moments before you're cradling that perfect cup of joe. I tend to take my coffee with milk and CSHH does one of the best flat whites around town. Gourmet coffee options also available. I particularly liked the indoor seating around a U-shaped bar and the wall full of coffee-related accessories. There's a great snack menu available too. If you're looking for a new independent coffee haunt a little off the beaten track, you could do far worse. Highly recommended

Before I talk about the coffee, let me say a few words about the ambience. This coffee shop (come restaurant) is in an "engineering" district of Singapore. The place has retained the name of the hardware store, and the decor is in keeping with its history. The building is an interesting mix of "old Singapore" and modern coffee shop. Very pleasing to the eye. There is both inside and outside seating.Now to the coffee. This place is dead serious about its coffee. They have one area where coffee beans are roasted (on a commercial scale). The barristers are highly knowledgable. Indeed they even hold classes about coffee and making coffee. And all of this is reflected in the quality of the coffee they serve. First class. You will not get better in Singapore (and I speak from experience, I have tried all of the best). The crockery, rather amusingly, carries a reference to Singapore's obsession with Nespresso capsules (apologies for mentioning these ghastly things): "capsules are dead". Quite right. Though I think might also say "Starbucks is dead" because the coffee at Starbucks is pretty similar to nespresso....But it doesn't end there. They dont have a big menu (to me, always a good sign) but the food they do serve is also very good indeed. Do a few things, but do them right, is obviously their approach. I had the palma ham on foccacia, it was excellent.The staff are polite, helpful, well trained, and, unlike some places, seem to use what God placed between their ears. It's busy and chaotic, but the staff get things sorted quickly.Fantastic coffee + great food soon gets around. This place is quite large, but gets very crowded. Arrive early to secure a table!VERY HIGHLY recommended
