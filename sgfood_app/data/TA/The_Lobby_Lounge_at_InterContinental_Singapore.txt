Exceeded my expectations. Gourmet Collection members get a 25% discount. This comes down to approx $35 pax. Great value! The food is also delicious, both the savoury and sweet snacks. And there is a wide selection of teas to choose from. I am coming again!
4
The Citrus Afternoon tea is good with free flow of scone. The place is quiet and good for afternoon tea. Will go again when they change the afternoon tea menu next quarter.
5
Excellent food and service. Atmosphere is good for families and friends. Will definitely come back again.
2
Average high tea cakes and drinks experience. Need more improvement on their live music entertainment and hospitality.
4
Enjoyable Three Tier Classic Afternoon Tea with Peranakan Heritage Menu. The hotel lobby lounge with high ceiling while there were two musician playing amazing piano and saxophone during the dine in experience was really awesome. Great atmosphere, location, food quality and service personnel.
5
Beautiful place to take a coffee or a tea, part of the 5 stars Intercontinental hotel on Bugis Junction

We tried the festive high tea menu and we must say that we were pleasantly surprised. Despite other similar high teas offered by other notable hotels being of the buffet kind, this set was more than enough for our stomachs. The savoury pastries were excellent and our only regret was that it was over soon after we started on them. The sweets were also an exciting experience popping each bite size treat into our mouths. Overall it was great value with a credit card promotion and we will definitely be back agai
2
It took forever to get the attention of the servers to place the order which itself took too long to arrive. Add to that the taste was average. The restaurant is huge and looks grand but all that pales when it comes to food and service

We went for the Christmas high tea on a Tuesday afternoon so it wasn't crowded. Ambience was quite nice, with live music and a beautiful Christmas tree in the background.They have a decent selection of (TWG) teas though not all were available. There was an acceptable amount of food for the price (esp with the 15% discount for Citibank credit cards) - more sweets than savouries which was a pity as we both preferred the savouries. All in all, a pleasant experience
1
Waited at the entrance of the Lobby lounge with my luggage for a good 8-9 minutes while eyeballing the waitresses casually hanging out at the back so I decided to walk up to the waitress at the back, with my luggage, asking for a table and an order of latte ... very interesting experience for me
5
The High Tea was delicious and beautiful with a wide range of teas and coffees. The service was excellent, especially our waitress Joey.
5
It's a good option for a night cap or just an informal meeting. Good selection of wine and cocktails. They had some entertainers in the evening, but you can choose a quieter place if you so choose.
4
High tea savories food was great and unique just the scones were to the dry side. We went for a friend birthday celebration and ambience was nice.
4
Large bright area with lots of comfortable seating options
Great choice of drinks and food, also does high teas and other events
Very modern in a colonial style
Is popular and service can be slow sometimes
Staff overall are good
2
There were no staff at the reception entrance area to attend to us despite standing there for nearly 10 min carrying my baby. I had to finally walked into the drinks area to ask for my reservation and ask for a seat. Selection of daily cake, only 1 choice , and it’s way too sweet for red velvet cake. Cold chocolate is sooo bland despite for a $10 drink . Definitely not a standard for a premium hotel.But on the side note , staff is friendly . But will not go back again. There’s better places and other hotels for cakes and tea
5
We visited the Lobby Lounge for the Straits Heritage Afternoon Tea and enjoyed it a lot. All the items were well thought out with the Singaporean/Malaysian theme and we liked having a good balance of savoury and sweet. We also appreciated having two choices of tea as well
5
We enjoyed the three-tier afternoon tea set on a Friday very much. The fusion Peranakan-inspired items were delicious and interesting. Our favourites included the chilli crab sandwich, lemon scones, chendol jelly and seafood satay.The atmosphere was relaxing and staff were always attentive and helpful. A great place to spend quality time with my best friend and one of the best high tea places in Singapore
4
we went for the $78++ for 2 pax promotion on a saturday noon. the atmosphere was good, very cosy with simple live band music.something to add on, the service was tip top.overall satisfied except for the menu variety which we felt can be improved on
4
Had high tea here last weekend. Beautiful setting and great service. The food was plenty on the 3 tier tray along with separate scones and satays. A very nice combination of Singaporean and Western treats which kept our family guessing as to the different tastes. A lovely afternoon accompanied by coffees, the creamiest hot chocolate ever and TWG teas
5
everything and every food wwas perfect, service was superb! crews/staffs are very nice and easy to get a long with
4
We enjoyed the light jazz singer with great voice and white wine. Will be back again. Servicecwas good. Ambience relaxing not too noisy or rowdy.
4
Work related semi formal meeting. Coffee was great. Service was decent. Presentation was excellent. Intimate setting and everyone had their own privacy as well.
4
Went for a hi-tea at the Lobby Lounge. Nice set of hi tea items served. You can also have a hot/cold coffee and tea. Nice warm scones were served. The staff were friendly and accommodating when we requested to swap some items. The ambience was nice and there was a live guitarist providing music that enhanced the soothing environment.
5
The food and service was good. Perfect ambience for a relaxing meal. Enjoyed the dining experience there
4
Had the high-tea @ $78++ for 2, on a weekday.Always enjoyed high-tea at the Intercontinental Singapore. The space is wide and comfortable, and the ambience is serene.Food wise is often a hit-and-miss. This period happens to be a Peranakan-Asia theme so coconut, banana, kaya, otah etc would feature in most of the items. Lemon and Milo scones were offered. They were ok at best. Savoury: Otah tartlets were good; chillicrab sandwiches were dry.Desserts: The mini-cakes were creative and featured flavours that were familiar. The most disappointing however was a terribly made ang-ku-kueh with a thick and tough skin. If Peranakan was the theme, then the kueh have got to be perfect.Slow service has always been an issue at the Lounge, but when you do get their attention, they are friendly and obliging
4
Ambience was lovely. They had a mini jazz band that came up at intervals. Would have prefer pure music without singing though. Seats were comfy. Overall had an enjoyable time
5
this is a classic large room with high ceiling and plush furnishing.It is very comfortable and peaceful. You can purchase coffee or a drink or have formal tea during tea time.This lounge will remind you of the elegant lounges in the classic beautiful hotels throughout Europe

I made a phone booking on tuesday the 11th (3 days before) mentioning my family (my 2 kids, my husband and I) will celebrate my husband's birthday on friday the 14th of july. I asked if it was possible to get 3 afternoon tea sets because my 4 year old son doesn't eat much, and the lady on the phone told me that we could order 2 sets for the adults and the children could order from the kids menu, I felt that providing 3 sets instead of 2 or 4 was causing troubles. But after I insisted on 3 sets, she agreed. Most importantly I asked if it was possible to get a candle for my husband, she replied that she would request for a slice of cake. Today we arrived at 2.45pm (with my kids excited about the surprise candle) and at 4.15pm when we where about to leave, I went to settle the billand ask about the candle...they had no idea what I was talking about!The lady in charge asked me for the name of the person I spoke to on the phone ...which I don't know!I wasn't after a free fancy cake, just request for a small gesture of putting a candle on any of the small dessert part of the tea set....apparently it was asking to much!It's a shame because the ambience of the lounge is great and the food was good but not sure we will go back, or at least not when celebrating a birthday
4
This place has lots of choices for an evening (pre-dinner) snack and drink. We were here for two days (Sat and Sun) and there was live performance both times. Certainly sets a great atmosphere that is both relaxing and entertaining. The staff were great and attentive yet not intrusive. Great place. Worth stopping by
4
i would recommend this place for a nice and quiet afternoon tea session with your girlfriends. I went on a weekday and I found the place cosy and relaxing. Food was mostly good, the presentation was near excellent.
5
Excellent ambiance, food and service!! Love the live music too!! Nice place to chill to spend the afternoon.
5
I was a regular of this place years ago when I was living in Singapore, but visited the Lobby Lounge for the first time since their big Reno. The ambiance hasn't changed too much but te live entertainment brings up the place alive. The drinks were not necessarily spectacular but the service was attentive and we were Day in a large booth behind the singer, so it was both entertaining and quiet enough for our group (7 ppl) to have a conversation. Will come back for high tea next time :
1
Dropped in for tea on a weekday afternoon. There was only one table occupied in the large lounge. Waited a while for someone to lead me to my seat. No one. Oh, a distance away was a waitress/bartender at the bar. And there was a waiter/supervisor making a two minute appearance at the end of the lounge. I approached the waitress/bartender for a simple question. In very simple English. She couldn't understand and went inside the kitchen area to find a supervisor. The supervisor came, answered my question and leaves! without showing me to my seat.Oh fine, I really needed to sit down to have a quiet tea time so I took a seat on my own. Perused the menu and the pricings are bordering on the ridiculous but hey, I was willing to pay if it was good.But I waited for another ten minutes and nobody was interested. The waiter/supervisor at the distance was more interested in chatting with a customer at the far end. The female supervisor disappeared. The waitress/bartender could not leave the bar. For such a large space, they had no one else around.I got up from my seat and left, after trying so hard to catch some attention.What a waste of my time
5
The ambience is really good, so comfortable and relaxing. The high tea is really delicious too. Best service ever
5
This is a physically beautiful lounge with good drinks, snacks, and sweets along with excellent service. Nice music. All in all, lovely
3
Had a family high tea at The Hotel Intercontinental Singapore. Food was average and the service is poor. The staffs are not attentive enough. Need to improve
4
Each piece is like a piece of art more than a dessert. I love the scones! Chef used very clever use of flowers in the desserts! Nice setting as well.
5
Quaint is the word I would use to describe this perfectly appointed Classic lobby with live Piano music and great seating. Suits the ambiance of the IC perfectly
5
Went for the Heritage Afternoon tea set on Sunday with the hubby. The Spring menu created by Chef Ben Goh did not disappoint us. Loved the savouries especially the duck rilletes with pickled lotus root and chrysanthemum. Hubby preferred the pan-seared prawn with gooseberries and thai chilli sauce though I did not really taste much chilli sauce. As for the sweets and pastries, what can I say except I was stuffed with the lovely lavender-blackcurrant tarte to the raspberry-rose choux pastry and jasmine scones which was delish with strawberry jam, violette-orange marmalade and clotted cream. Was disappointed that the lemon scones turned out to be an ordinary raisin scone though. The sweet ending to the meal was the crepe with berry compote and hibiscus-peach sorbet. The 4-pc jazz quartet lent a charming atmosphere to the whole lobby playing familiar classics and golden oldies that one can sing along or tap your toes to. The wait staff were also commendable and attentive when they needed to be. My thanks to Amy Hong who checked on us frequently to ensure that we had everything we needed including topping up the hot water in the teapot for my TWG Emperor's White Garden tea
3
This is the explanation given to us when we celebrated a birthday there in a group of 26 people - booked in advance and high- tea ordered for all.20 guests received their sets more than 90 minutes after arrival. The promised 'free-flow' of scones came in batches of once 20pc, thereafter 4pc , followed by a half-cooked batch. The crepe was served when the first guests were leaving. Really embarrassing. That said, the food served on the three-tiered stands (each stand for 2 persons) really looks pretty and tastes great. There is a variety of sweet and savoury pairs of items e.g. dainty tarts decorated with edible flowers, quiche and tiny sandwiches . A menu is given to select various teas or coffee.Service crew is friendly and helpful.
4
The ladies were very attentive and noticed that mummy was feeling warm. Offered a cold drink since there is nothing much they could do to their Aircon
5
Comfortable seating with live music, enhansing the drinks and snacks experience. Gather a group of your close friends and enjoy the moment.
5
The service was attentive and food was good. Told them that we are celebrating our anniversary and they gave us a complimentary cake!
3
An ok lounge area mainly filled with Yuppy Singapore people rather than hotel guests
Wanting to be seen
5
Passed by while staying at the Intercontinental. Live music and cocktails in a beautiful setting, what more could you ask for?
5
Very nice way to have a cuppa a chat and a feed in the afternoon they have high tea and live music and the service is excellent. Well worth a visit.
5
the three tiers were delicious and were deceptively minute bites - we were stuffed by the end! also 4 drinks are included in the afternoon tea set: the singapore heritage tea is highly recommendedthe piano player was also a bonus and was very talented, adding to the great relaxed atmospher
4
we had a relaxing weekend high tea here, without being hassled to leave after finishing (a rarity in Sg!) food was not bad too!,they came to offer us extra servings of those yummy scones. too bad the waiters and waitresses seemed lacking in knowledge of the menu. nevertheless a pretty good option for tea. will recommend i
5
Beautiful lounge and friendly staffs. Especially little girl name "Audrey" greeted with big smile and help us with direction. Very great service. Well trained. Most friendly accommodating. They know true value of customer service. Thumbs up. I will definitely back to this hotel again and will recommend this hotel with full confidence.
5
The Lobby Lounge is located around the corner from the front desk lobby giving it an "Oh what's this" when discovered by guests. The 2 story high ceilings lit by large, beautiful chandeliers allow light to pervade throughout the space and complement the natural light coming in through the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the reception courtyard. Soft music playing in the background adds to the ambience throughout the day when live music is not being performed. It's a great place to just gather your thoughts....or as I am this morning, catching up on my TA reviews following a wonderful visit to Singapore
4
Excellent atmosphere and I enjoyed the live music by the pianist. Had their Royal Heritage Afternoon Tea which was not too bad but it was slightly pricey.
4
This is a great lobby bar and the atmosphere is great. There are booths setup on the size and very comfortable sofas. Live music in the evenings - fantastic vibe.
4
Large room with high ceilings and lots of natural light. You can orders drinks or cakes. In the morning they will offer free croissants which is a nice touch
The staff are excellent with great service
Comfortable seating and nice atmosphere
5
Quiet but grand heritage settings, excellent and friendly service. Live music was performed there as well
5
The lounge was comfortable, especially after a whole morning of sight seeing. Wide selection of pastries and cakes, they were amazing. While we were there, we enjoyed the pianist performance too.
5
Best place to relax after work! Thank you Linda and Amy for the friendly and kind hospitality. They're the reason for me and my friends always prefer to chill here. 👍🏻
5
Had coffee at the Lobby Lounge. It was such a peaceful space... perfect to take a short break and reflect. Chairs are so comfortable, i almost did not want to leave. Coffee comes with complementary croissants. Worth a visit.
5
Last week we had high tea for the first time at the Lobby Lounge, and we discovered that we had been missing a great experience. They had special Easter high tea with creative pastries, and we enjoyed the music of the piano and two violins playing semi classical music. The room appears both historic and grand with enormous pillars spaced close together as if it was built before the days of steel and reinforced concrete. We were charmed by the attention of Ms. Joanne in Guest Relations and by the care of our server, Ms. Sophia, who was adept at eliciting from us exactly what taste of tea would please us the most. We recommend the high tea at the Lobby Lounge as a delightful and refreshing afternoon experience
4
We ordered the Heritage High Tea and I wish there were more savoury items offered though the sweets were quite delish. Two drinks are offered with the tea. We ordered the Earl Grey and a latte later. Both drinks were well made with enough tea leaves in the pot and the latte came in a huge glass. The lobby is a nice respite from the busy area in which it is situated. However, we did wish it was a little cooler. The air-conditioning was hardly felt and by the time we had the hot tea, most of us were pespiring.
4
This is the first time I choose to have my high tea session in intercontinental hotel after I was recommended by a Friend of mine. The serve two selections of high tea sets, and also free flow for the coffee. I like their tea selection and I enjoy the time with my Friend during the tea session. Nice ambience and at the same time with someone playing a nice piano music... fantastic! The staffs there also provide a very good customer service to the guest too. I will definitely go back again if there is a chance.
5
Best place to sit and relax and dine with highest standards of world class continental food with outclass service.
5
We used this in the evening instead of the Exec Lounge because we had young children but it was still a wonderfull experience with the same standard of care and service
5
You get light soothing music. Not noisy or overly pack. The drinks are not pricey. Staffs leave you a lone unless when call for them
5
Really well appointed luxury , take your time have a cup of tea and read a book , if you have time make it the full afternoon tea
5
Great service and variety of drink menu staff were just wonderful could not do enough for you I highly recommend this little Santuary
5
Great atmosphere and fab service, Good place to have a quiet drink. Staff are very welcoming and friendl
5
A beautifully decorated hotel lounge bar, with a peaceful and calm atmosphere, excellent staff, and a perfect Long Island Iced Tea
4
The name itself is a misnomer, the lobby is actually further apart by the corner. Me and the girls had tea here and were impressed with the tea set, however service can be bit slow if they get really busy during the weekend.There is live music but its those elevator music so it won't disturb your conversation.Definitely one of the better place to yum-cha in Singapore
5
Afternoon tea at the Lobby lounge was a truly delightful experience. Cosy setting, quiet music, attentive yet unobtrusive service made a perfect setting for a tête-à-tête . Delicious pastries that were so pretty we almost couldn't bear to eat them! Good balance of sweets and savouries, and a generous supply of yummy scones that we wished we could make room for more! The Christmas special was one indulgence we relished
5
If you're fortunate enough to be in town, make sure you stop by the Lobby Lounge at the InterContinental during the evening time. There is a beautiful Kenyan singer who is classy, sultry and extremely pleasant to listen to. Along with her wonderful pianist, they play everything from Nat King Cole's LOVE to Cindy Lauper's Time After Time. I'm not sure how long she will be in town, but she is not to be missed
5
Called in here for afternoon tea, a fantastic place, colonial style decor with a pianist and violinists playing in the background made for a very relaxing atmosphere.
The sandwiches and cakes were first class.
5
We never actually sat in it as used club room. But went past it everyday often sat on the mezzanine and listened to music piano and sometimes violin. It looks very comfortable and appealing
5
Had the chance to experience afternoon tea at the Lobby lounge of the InterContinental Singapore. Elegant setting, wide selection of specialty teas, and amazing cakes & sandwiches. We enjoyed our tea accompanied by a classical quartet. What a treat!
4
Nice lobby for Hotel serving afternoon tea for club guests. Good prompt staff. Plenty of comfy chairs
4
The staff servicing our table was very efficient & pleasant. Nice ambient. Good for a leisure drink or catch up with friends as well as conducive for business meeting.
5
This is one of my favorite hotels in Singapore, so naturally it's one of my favorite lobby bars too. The hotel is lovely and the lobby is majestic. A good mix of old and new, but everything is classy.
1
The scones are stodgy and come with a strange pinkish concoction that one presumes is supposed to be jam. They were among the WORST scones in the world (we have stayed in Intercontinentals in London, Osaka, Mauritius, Bali, as well as other hotels of comparable standing). There is an indifferent selection of savouries and sweet pastries (one serving only, unlike some other luxury hotels in Singapore and abroad). At SGD78 per couple plus tax and service, the high tea is enormously overpriced. For that sum one can get a high tea buffet at other hotels. Emphatically NOT recommended
4
I stayed in Inter- Continental hotel, so Lobby Lounge was the closest restaurant to the lift. huge space, very nice interior and authentic atmosphere, comfortable old stile armchairs, friendly staff. It is a great place to have a cup of coffee or to manage friendly business meeting. They have grand piano, so evening time there is life music
5
I stayed at The Lobby Lounge quite a few times. It lovely in the afternoon to enjoy a nice cup of coffee, cakes and listed to the fabulous live music being played. As with all other staff in the hotel, the staff at the Lobby Lounge are wonderful.
5
This hotel has exceptional staff who really enjoy their job. Nothing is too much trouble and the Hotel is pristine in all aspects. Spacious, bright and airy welcoming lobby with sofas, armchairs, among some eye catching artifacts. The rooms are a good size with very comfortable beds. The breakfast caters for all tastes and yummy. The Intercontinental Singapore made me sad to say goodbye because it was that good. Singapore is an awesome place for business or leisure with so much variety with fantastic architecture, casino, culture and of course its history
5
The service is excellent and the facilities great for relaxing and
pass a nice time with friends. There is piano music every afternoon & evenings
5
Go for the Music, the Service and the Friendly Staff. This centrally located hotel has a beautiful lounge. Time your visit for the afternoon for the classical music or the singer in the evening. Suitable equally for business or social meetings.
5
Enjoyed using the lobby lounge, however allow plenty of time as service can be slow. Waited over 30 mins for my drink. I was in no hurry so this didn't bother me but this could be a problem for those on a time frame
4
From all IC hotels I stayed in in SEA region, IC SG's Lobby Lounge is the best. Its grand looking furniture and chandeliers make it a best meeting place with friends to chat, and to have some F&B.
5
a beautiful lounge with polite and professional service providing quality whilst lovely live music washes away the days heat and stress - what more could one want?
5
The lobby is nice and comfortable and a great way to relax with friends. If you come at night, the live entertainment is a wonderful touch
4
This is my 2nd visit to this lounge. I went to this lounge after 6 pm, for late snack and alcoholic coffee.This place is crowded because there are many people going there for drinks.I had a piece of cake ( large piece ) , fruit platter and a glass of royal coffee (coffee with brandy)Do you know how much is the alcoholic coffee in this lounge? $14.I am impressed with the price because all 5 star hotel put alcoholic coffee at higher price. Royal coffee tended to be more expensive because brandy is more expensive.It was served in a medium sized glass. (standard glass for cafe latte).I am glad that I have chosen this place over TCC cafe which is located in same area.In TCC cafe, lrish Coffee is priced higher than the one offered at this lounge.and cake at TCC cafe is smaller. Overall, it is a wonderful lounge with extensive menu for snacks, desserts and drinks.It also served good afternoon tea sets
5
I went to this place at 3 pm today.I had a high tea . Now, there are 2 high tea sets available.One is for Royal Afternoon Tea which come with a teapot with 3 tier tray with pastries,sandwiches, and desserts. One is called Un-afternoon tea set ,very creative and unusual name. It came with 3 tier tray and a cup of coffee of your choice, (regular coffee, cuppucino, latte..)I pick Royal Afternoon tea with hot tea and one cold mocktail.The service is very good. I was given extra sandwiches by one lounge staff, I did not request for them.I gladly accept them.I was playing games on tablet when lounge staff came and poured tea for me and then replenished tea .After eating, I felt so full that I skipped dinner.The meal is not too sweet .I will be back again for other set . (Un afternoon tea with a cup of coffee.
2
Under staffed - a few ladies were serving and they missed serving one of the tea and it was difficult to get their attention. I had to walk over to the desk and asked for my tea twice. When we ran out of tea, it would be an effort to get someone attention to add water. The scones were the best and the rest of pastry/snacks were really not worth paying top dollars for. We got a discount so we ended up paying about $40 each but we felt the money would have been spent more wisely ordering tea and a la cart cakes and pastry somewhere else. Ambience was good, food is not impressive and service was a BIG let down.
5
One of the nicest high teas in Singapore. Super fresh, tasty, lovely presented and served with such grace. Intercontinental delivers as always. They also have a coffee option, in case you don't want tea. Live music with famous musical highlight. Reasonable price for Singapore. Highly recommended, way better value than other hotels we visited for high tea. I particularly like the fact that it wasn't freezing cold in The Lobby, good distance between tables (which is perfect for conversation), top service.
4
Quiet good service and excellent layout. Filled with a lot of budding Singapore wannabes.needing to be seen.
5
Rest your weary feet here with their sumptuous afternoon tea. I personally had wine with my sandwiches but whatever you have you will leave revived. Great pianist with violins make the mood complete. Beautiful chandeliers and comfortable seats. An oasis
5
We went just for a glass of champagne and we're very happy with the place, atmosphere, service and champagne of course.
5
It was so nice to just sit and relax at the lobby munching on some snacks and listening to the entertainment! The place was so clean and organised. Well done to all the staff at the Intercontinental.
5
Lots of space and comfortable seating arrangements. Lovely live music in the afternoons. Daily newspapers available. The Victoria Bar with its pub-like atmosphere is just off the Lobby Lounge. A nice place for drinks and light snacks.
5
Best coffee I had whilst in Singapore. very comfortable. Lovely live music . Relaxing place especially on a rainy afternoon.
5
Beautiful Lobby Lounge: elegant and classy atmosphere. Afternoon tea is superb with very large choice and attentive staff. Well worth a visit!
4
We stopped here for an early snack and drinks before going to the Gardens By The Bay evening light show and we returned to enjoy casual dinner (appetizers) and drinks after the show. The atmosphere is elegant and comfortable. They have a good selection of wine and appetizers to enjoy. Plus they had a singer and piano act for a portion of the evening. A perfect way to relax after being outside running around all day.
5
We thoroughly enjoyed a most delightful Afternoon Tea in the Lobby Lounge today. As my wife is a vegetarian we booked ahead and discussed possible options with the staff, they could not have been more accommodating. When our tea arrived the chef had very thoughtfully substituted some of the standard items with excellent vegetarian alternatives allowing my wife to fully enjoy the experience. We are not Singapore residents so cannot comment on the service elsewhere in the city but we were greatly impressed by this experience and would not hesitate to recommend the Lobby Lounge to anyone wanting to enjoy Afternoon Tea in a beautiful setting. Thanks to all of the lounge staff, including the pianist, for making our final afternoon in Singapore so enjoyable
2
We were excited to try high tea here, partly because of the refurbished lobby area. While we enjoyed the overall ambience, this was the only blemish to our otherwise perfect stay at InterContinental. The area was only half packed, but service was slow. We did a face-to-face reservation the day before, but our baby chair still took a long while to arrive. We were quite confused to be served our tea before our welcome cocktails. While we appreciate the waitress taking time to explain each dessert/ snack, the scones took a long time to arrive (we had to ask), and the crepes never made it (we only remembered the day after). Not sure if the music was meant to appeal to the older crowd with some cheesy "classics", but I thought the music could be classier (maybe Jazz?). The service made the food forgettable and experience disappointing
5
Excellent hotel lobby bar. Elegant setting. Quiet, discreet layout with comfortable chairs. Great service from friendly and efficient staff. Wide range of drinks and light bites on the menu. Recommended.
4
The lounge is a really nice place to sit and have a drink with friends or colleagues. However, the pricing is really expensive and not even remotely in line with other venues within proximity to the hotel.
3
As with the rest of the hotel, the lounge is renovated from its original colonial building and design. The super high ceiling, piano/harp adds to the ambience. Good for a tea session with friends
4
Cozy and relaxing, best place for having discussion, friends get together. Smiling faces all around to welcoming you, giving you kind of warm and comfy atmosphere to enjoy your drink there.
4
The Lobby Lounge is for more a light meal, but we still had a Pizza and a large rice dish which were both very good, if a bit expensive
5
Loved the space here and the interiors, the chandeliers and the setting was very beautiful, had breakfast every morning here and I loved it.
5
Really cool old world English feel about this place. Loved the service & the Club Lounge is so worth the extra $. Very close to shopping & transport. Great high teas & snacks. Quality all the way.
3
The lobby lounge is very pleasant but quite expensive. There are other bars close by that offer better value for money but it is a convenient meeting place
4
This is a great place to have drinks, high tea and just hang out. It has a very relaxed vibe and comfortable seating. Both times we were there they had live music which kicked it up another notch. The crowd is a mix of international and local. They have a great gin selection and the cocktails especially The Red Shamrock were yummy. The service was excellent and the staff was very attentive and helpful, even getting us a taste of one of the items on the high tea menu we were wondering about! Loved spending our time there
5
Currently under renovation the hotel is an iconic landmark in Singapore and easily rivals Raffels,new decor and a thorough make over is long overdue to restore this beauty to its original glamour,the lobby lounge is a calm retreat for afternoon tea and cocktails,a romantic venue for a tryst and more
5
I love just sitting in here chilling, the afternoon tea is amazing and also the Sunday brunch is great, nice service
5
This is an amazing hotel that I really recommend if this is you're budget or choose a meal from one of your choice and budget, but the walk around the hotel lobby is something simply beatdown and do enjoy
3
This is a beautiful lounge at the Intercontinental Hotel with a lot of old historic charm. The food here is limited, very expensive and nothing special. If you are staying at the hotel you can have breakfast here. That apart, I would give it a miss
1
Don't make the mistake going here during the weekend to drink a cappuccino, it's hard to get a seat in the lobby bar. You are lucky when you have a chance to get the attention of the waiter. Waited 20min and when the cappuccino's arrived they are not warm at all and one could clearly see that the foam has been standing for a longer time. Tried to get another waitress to the table for the next 3min without success. When one arrived we asked why the long standing cappuccino was served in the first place. The very young girl looked at us clearly didn't understand, we decided to leave our coffees for what it was pay and leave. F&B manager should pay more attention to what is going on on a busy Sunday morning. On another note: I asked for a WiFi code on arrival but was refused as walk in guest, strange
5
The InterContinental is an outstanding hotel as is, with its Peranakan Heritage decor it feels like you have stepped back in time. In saying that it still as the utmost modern and luxurious feel while dining with the huge chandeliers and classic wooden furniture. After a busy day walking around the city all we felt like eating was a regular club sandwich, the waitress was extremely friendly, polite and understood that I wanted a vegetarian version of the classic meal. Never have I ever appreciated such a basic sandwich before! It was truly satisfying.

Lobby Lounge at Intercontinental is an interesting laid back place which resembles more like one of the ancient palaces. You can drop by here and sit on one of the couches while waiting for someone to arrive or drop by into the malay street or dip into some exciting cuisine at the olive tree restaurant

This is a beautiful, large relaxing space which is very tastefully decorated (as is the entire hotel in fact) to eat breakfast, grab an afternoon coffee, conduct some business or just chill out. The foyer is perfect for a great cool break from the humidity outside and to refresh before 'attacking' the local sights again.

Friendly staff who genuinely seem like nothing is too much trouble. The seats are comfortable and nicely spaced apart in clusters so you can have a private conversation with business associates. You sit under a soaring ceiling with lovely decor. The one thing to be careful of is time. It can pass quickly when you're enjoying a nice drink in great surrounds

Ordered a Royal Hazelnut cake which has a rich and creamy hazelnut taste and crispy cake base! It is not too sweet and yet the chocolates pieces that complement the cake made up for it!!!The mocktail Shirley Temple was well concocted and was less sweet as compared to those I drank before elsewhere

The lobby lounge is highly atmospheric and aims to recreate the ambience of a colonial era Peranakan mansion. A strict door policy means that it is not overwhelmed with non-paying guests trying to use the wifi. There is a reasonable a la carte menu - enough for a light lunch or grazing food while having a business meeting, but it isn't exactly cheap. Unless I am meeting someone and need the peace and quiet for a meeting I'll go outside to one of the eateries in the mall

The lounge area is spacious but the feel is Brown. Very few people using it during our 4 day stay. Could do with better lighting and maybe some live music to liven the place up.
Staff very pleasant.

I was amazed by how friendly and helpfull of the staff at the Lobby Lounge. The coffee and cake there also not bad either. Very convenient place to have coffee and snacks.

Very grand and spacious lobby with pianist - the perfect location for afternoon tea, relaxed business meetings or a get together with family and friends. Attentive service and reasonably priced.

Now with the hotel entrance from Bugis Junction only open for hotel guests make it a hassle as have to tell the hotel staff so that they will open the door for entrance. Tried the Peranakan high tea at $38++ per pax. Small variety only 8 items and most of the items nothing much to shout out.No staffs were around when we stepped in so we just got a seat ourselves. Perhaps it was a weekday so there were not mant people in the lounge. Only thing I liked was the display of the high tea items.With this price, there are other hotel high tea more worthy of going than this

A great hotel lobby lounge.  Love their cappuccino, lively music, and watching people.  A great mix of old and new.  Right off the Bug is street mall.  Go in the back door, just tell the doormen your going to the lobby coffee shop and they will let you in.

My partner and I had peranakan afternoon tea here and it had its pros and cons. I've had afternoon tea in around 20 hotels around the world and this was fairly average. The lobby itself is large and majestic, the presentation of the afternoon tea in a miniature bookcase is very unique and certainly photogenic, however the serving is very small and heavy on the desserts. Since you're missing the scones segment you will leave feeling hungry. Considering this, I found the price to be a little on the high side

This is an ideal place to relax after a stressful day. The lounge has a lovely atmosphere and has a wide array of drinks and light snacks on offer.
Ideal for pre-dinner or post dinner drinks
4
Ambience was fantastic, Food was great, but drinks were very expensive. Food was priced right. Seating was limited. A nice place for couples, but better options for families close by.

+ Convenient
- Service not the best we've had at this hotel.
- Very loud music (several occasions). More 'disco' than 'hotel lobby'.
5
A very comfortable lounge with occasional light entertainment (piano/singer) Very pleasant atmosphere although the coffee was fairly expensive but that's not to detract from the quality
4
The ambience is really special and the service good. The perfect friend to meet friends and colleagues.
5
best coffee in town and a huge variety of western and local snacks. Fits the bill at any time of day
5
Staff at the lounge was attentive. The canapes were varied and appealed to both young and old. The cocktail and wine selection is appealing
3
Served beverages fine, but took over 40 minutes (after multiple chasing) to serve the food. I had a flight to catch so requested them to hurry up, and they confused things further by suggesting to pack the food for me to take away (I was with friends and their 2 little girls). They were apologetic and did not charge for the food, which was kind of the staf
4
I decided to try out the afternoon tea here and was not disappointed. The surroundings were lovely, staff obliging ( although not very attentive) and food was tasty. It cost 44$ (38$ + tax and service) and consisted of tiny open sandwiches, a small savoury tart, and a variety of sweet pastries plus 2 scones. I hadn't eaten lunch so I finished the lot:-) . Other places give refills but it didn't matter as that was enough for me. I chose Jasmine tea and they gave me another pot when asked. There are newspapers to read and free Wifi

They have a great happy hour (check the times) and some great bar food... There are high top tables as well as sofa's and of course there is plenty of room at the bar. There are actually two rooms to the bar the first room you come to from in the hotel is a little quieter than in the bar area itself.... They have live music a couple times a week
