Food was good. Mushroom soup, clam chowder was great. Their garlic bread was even better. Soulfish was tasteless but upon adding salt tasted much better. Fish and chips were nice !

Went there with my family and the fish and chips stood out. Very nice batter and good sized portion. The staff was also very pleasant and attentive.

Its a family owned cafe and the owners were too enthusiastic on talking to us that its a little irritating. Food is so so only.

2nd visit here and food is decent. Fish n chips are quite delish. Mushroom soup is da bomb. Keeps us coming back for more. Waffles can be chosen made medium rare, well done etc. So I can get it crispy and fluffy the way I want it

Came for dinner one evening not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the good food and service. It's a tiny family-run cafe that clearly takes pride in what they do. We had the salted egg pasta - which was absolutely scrumptious - the fish & chips and duck confit which were also done well

Have anticipated that this will be a small outfit and food might not be up to mark but still hope that it will be unexpected! But alas! Not a place that will warrant a second visit! The food is not fantastic and I could get cheaper and tastier fare at coffeeshops or hawker centres but the drawback is no aircon at those places. The Good Thyme's Fish & Chips ordered with Bravas Sauce consists of slimmy, soggy dory fish of the cheap quality and unspectacular Bravas Sauce. The Chicken Chop with Brown Sauce is passable but the 2 Chicken Cutlets, one with Aioli Dip and one with Tar Tar Sauce were too oily. The tomato soup and mushroom soup were passable only as I have tasted much better ones elsewhere. The only service staff available is enough to serve us as there were only 3 tables occupied at lunch time (12.45pm). The aircon interior is inaccessible by wheelchair as there is an entrance kerb about 5" high but if you don't mind the heat, there are a few tables outside the restaurant that is wheelchair friendly.
