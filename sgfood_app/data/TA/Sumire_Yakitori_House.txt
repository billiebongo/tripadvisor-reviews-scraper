Had the lunch set here and is good. Service is faster than the previous time I were here. Hopefully got more choice of lunch menu.
4
Restaurant is just a stone throw from the MRT, so getting there should not post any problem. Staff are friendly. Food were above average.
4
Excellent, food was good. Ambience excellent, staff was very nice and friendly too. Value for money, and the environment wad good.
4
Although i change 2 times of my booking timing, i still get a table promptly.
When the table is full of plates , they adjust the table accordingly.
4
still as good hence the return with my friends to enjoy a dinner with good and atmosphere to catch up with each other
5
Sashimi is very fresh and the bbq is awesome. Beer is also reasonable. It is a good place for gathering and business discussion.
5
Spent more than we planned but really enjoyed the food despite the slightly higher cost compared to other restaurants. Great service, excellent atmosphere, great food, perfect night. Loved the sushi especially.
5
Nice food and drinks suitable for small group gathering! Good range of alcohol and very nice highball!
4
Went for lunch and the set menu had quite a few reasonably priced items. Service was also good, staff were friendly.
4
We visited the Sumire Yakitori house after my sonâ€™s class in Bugis area. We are aware that this Japanese outfit is famous for its skewer offerings. We ordered a few items, including unagi don and salmon sashimi. Unfortunately the chicken thigh Yakitori that we ordered ran out. What stands out among the items that we ordered was the grilled corn skewer. It looks like a normal corn on a cob. However, according to my son, this is the best corn he has ever tried in his life. Costs SGD2.90 per stick
4
Went on a weekends and order their lunch set. Lunch set had a generous serving and it was really affordable.
4
Food quality was good and services are fine too. Variation of lunch set are suitable for office crowds.
4
Atmosphere of the restaurant is good. Service not too bad, waitress is friendly. Food was served abit slow.
5
Second time here, food and service is still as good, very friendly service staff who is very attentive, food are served promptly and tastes delicious!
5
The food is great! Service is excellent. Went there with a large group of 8 and they had no problem accommodating us.
5
Go for the lunch set. It is good value for $. Kids menu is quite nice too. This restaurant used to be less crowded but it is a must for me to make reservation these days.
4
I went for lunch. The set lunch menu’s are good value but could do with more choice. Service is good but not exceptional.
4
Nice food and portion. Skewers are feeshly prepared and served. Set lunch is nice, price is reasonable.
3
The food was only lukewarm when served. probably was left for a while after cooking before serving. Furthermore, it was a little too salty too. Average.
4
Had some sushi here and it was really good! The service was friendly and great! Would definitely recommend!
5
very efficient quick to serve restaurant which serves authentic Japanese food, well prepared and helpful friendly staff in a nice environment
4
Our first visit to Sumire Yakitori. It offers variety of set meals at very reasonable and affordable price. We will definitely patronize Sumire again.
3
Ordered a platter that varies of sticks, but turned out lack of flavour and colour tone due to not char enough. Needed to ask for sauce, but only came after asking for third time. Might want to consider other options for similar products.
5
The food is worth the value spent, just that the waiter are tooo busy. Need to wait quite awhile if you have ad hoc request
4
They had revise thier menu. there are now now chooses available.
I had the yuzu highball but it taste more yuzu then whiskey
4
One of our family's favorite go to venue for dinner. Menu items always pleased the young & old with its variety of options.
3
@TheKuoKnowsYou can be forgiven for thinking that Sumire specialises in bento boxes. It certainly has more boxes than Father Christmas.But it does do them well. It also manages to get them from kitchen to table in double-quick time. Mine arrived within five minutes of ordering..........Admittedly it was only raw fish on rice. But even the options that needed some cooking turned up quickly.Sumire also does a lot of things on skewers. Anything that can be threaded on a wooden stick is pierced and grilled. Grilled avocado anyone.I like Sumire. It is unpretentious. It is honest and it is welcoming. It also has a loyalty card. Points means prizes
4
We had an enjoyable family dinner. Service staff attended to us once we sat down with cabbage appetizer. Good variety of sake and shochu. Yakitori taste great although slighter pricier than regular yakitori restaurants. The service staff were efficient and friendly. Only thing is that we were placed at the table right at the exit which was quite annoying as customers were going out of that door to access the washrooms. Every time the door opens, we can smell the outside smoke and gush of wind kept coming in. I will ask for another table the next time. Not sure if I can indicate the preference on Chope app. Other than that, everything was good and will definitely go back
3
Other than the Salmon Sashimi, most of the dishes are salty. Dasien Tori Gyoza was super salty. I have never tasted Japanese food of that salt level. Waiter said that it is supposed to be very salty. We did not finish it. Perhaps I am a mountain turtle.Cabbage was great. Salmon was fresh.Personal opinion on the experience:- Food: 2/5- Environment: 4.5/
3
Thought that the place was not crowded but turned out that most of the tables were under reservation. In the end we decided on the counter seats with a great view of the staffs grilling the sticks. Although we were sitting right in front of the grilling section, it was not smoky. While looking through the menu, we were served a complimentary side dish which was lightly dressed cabbage.Volcano Roll ($9.90++/ 4pcs)Sushi roll with avocado, crabmeat, and cucumber on top with spicy salmon, flying fish roe and homemade spicy mayonnaise sauceFelt the roll itself was rather bland without the mayonnaise sauce. The avocado, crab meat and salmon could barely be tasted.Bakudan Korokke ($8.90++)Homemade Egg Potato CroquetteIt looked like a deep fried ball when served. Cut it opened, one would be able to see the molten lava egg yolk flowing out smooothlng from inside. Potato salad enclosed the egg. Interesting dish by itself. No wonder it was recommended by the staff. Tsukune ($4.90++)Big Chicken Meatball with CheeseThe meatball were so juicy and crunchy that my partner thought we were having pork meatballs and could not believe that its chicken.Enoki Bacon ($3.90++)Bacon & Golden Mushroom with Garlic Soy SauceThe stick looked rather dry but it was juicy and crunchy.Eringi ($3.90++)Oyster Mushroom in Garlic ButterI like that the mushroom was lightly seasoned which one could still taste the actual flavour of the mushroom.We down the meal with green tea ($1++/ pax), which was refillable
4
Yummy yummy skewer food and tasty soup base... good services ! Nice environment for chit chat and gathering
5
Happy hour beers and family, business crowds enjoying good food. It's the place to be anytime of e day/week.
3
The yakitori is just average with plentiful of salt scattered on it and the chawanmushi is plain with tiny scraps of mushroom .. mediocre. However, the ambience is good for friends to gather.
4
The food was nice and fresh and there was a large variety to choose from.
The lunch set is more than enough to fill you up and is economically priced.
The service is quick and polite as you would expect.
They cater well for children
4
Lunch sets were reasonably priced and offered good variety. Service was prompt and efficient. Restaurant was let down by less-than-fresh Salmon Sashimi on our visit, the texture was off- either due to temperature or quality. The chawanmushi was served piping hot and was fantastic.
4
Had the yakitori set, which was value for money. (approx $14 for 5 assorted sticks) Ordering was also a breeze with the self ordering system using an ipad. The service staff were also prompt in refilling our teas :)
4
Nice ambience. A place where friends can gather and catch-up with one another. Good food, nice wine. I simply love the plum wine!
4
Sumire Yakitori House serves consistently good food. Lately, I've been going there with different groups of friends for gatherings, and each time, they have praised the food for being good. I would recommend the Bakkudan - always a crowd pleaser! I didn't really like the Unagi sushi though, mainly because of the cream cheese inside. I didn't think it matched the taste of the Unagi. For Unagi lovers, just go for the Unagi don.. U will be happier with it.
5
I had the Salad set lunch and added on Salmon Sashimi for $3. The total was about $13 - really reasonable and value for money since I had a great shredded chicken salad, aburi salmon sushi, chawanmushi and miso soup. The food was also fresh - something I look out for when trying out Japanese restaurants with set meals
4
It's so easy to order. Waiter gives you an ipad, you select the items you want from the menu, and next thing you know, your food arrives! You can ask for the bill via the ipad as well. It's really convenient. The first time I came, they had a Ladies Night promo (1 free drink) - I was so delighted! I came with a friend, so it was the perfect night for us. We both had a yummy umeshu, and ordered an array of yakitori dishes as well as sushi. Everything we had was pretty good, but I think my favorite was the chicken meatballs. Try the Sumire Moriawase, its a sampler of several different yakitory. The grilled avocado was interesting! The second time I went was with my husband, and I had the chicken ramen. It was pretty good! I haven't been back for a while, but definitely will visit again soon :
5
Lunch set is quite a bargain, starting from 9.9 dollar. The portion is quite big and food is very nice. I have been there twice for lunch set.
2
Standard drop!!!!! Food portion become smaller compared to last time and price increase!!! Definitely will not return again!!!
4
Nice atmosphere, awesome staff, nice food. The staff are polite, quick and full of smiles. There is seriously nothing i can pick on.
5
If you are looking for affordable Japanese food that will still make you go oishiiiii, sumire yakitori should be your choice.
5
Really good food! Value is a little on the high side but the service is immaculate!
Will come back again for the food and service.
4
This was my 2nd time dining at Sumire. The yakitori is reasonably price and tasty. Service is also very prompt. Noted a few tables of Japanese diners on both my visits.
4
The croquette was amazing. Open it up to find an onsen egg inside! The rest of the yakitori was good. Wide variety of choice. I like to be able to select only salt seasoning, other than the teriyaki sauce. Happy hour on Tues is 1 for 1 highball. Good value. I would have prefer the grilled squid to be plain though, other than in teriyaki sauce
5
Visited Sumire Yakitori with my wife on a Saturday night. It is just round the corner from the Intercontinental hotel. We were greeted with an 'irrashaimase' and were seated. A menu and tablet were brought over for us to place our order. We placed our order for everything we wanted but the food came quickly and close together so I'd recommend staggering it. We had a selection of yakitori - pork belly (oddly bland), beef (chewy) and chicken (tasty) - blow torched mackerel (excellent), chicken karaage (excellent), gyoza with the sweet sauce (excellent) and a dinner set of eel on rice, pork with eggs and mushrooms, miso soup, salad and pickles (overall good). For dessert I had the tofu cheesecake (interesting flavour) and my wife the matcha ice cream (flavour could have been stronger). I had a calpis to drink and my wife some fresh guava juice. Service was attentive. A service charge and tax charge are added to the bill. We spend $108. Overall a 5* rating given we really enjoyed most of the elements. We would return.
3
We requested for a quiet corner and were disappointed at the table given for the 6 of us.It was near the glass exit door. Every time the door opened we experienced a gust of hot air running thru the table.The chicken yakitori stick was bad... very dry and overdone.
3
Had dinner here. You place your orders with an iPad. Food was average, nothing really stood out except for the tskune. The place was rather noisy so we left after finishing our food instead of chatting over drinks. Had to constantly request for refills for our drinks.
4
Service from the staffs was good. The food and portion were ok. It's a pity we did not get to try the seasonal Sakura pudding.
5
Fav hangout for dinner for yummy yakitori. It's other dishes are also good. The sumire salad, meatballs, and beer!
3
There are better izakaya or jap family restaurants around. And the ordering system doesnt work with the tablet hanging all the time, and wro g food being brought to the table.
5
Comfort food at reasonable price and excellent service staff. Am regular here. Food is good and atmosphere as well
4
A wonderful place tucked at the corner next to Intercontinental Hotel. Quiet and calm amongst the hustle and bustle Bugis Junction mall. Food selection is wide. Quality is fantastic. Ambience is wonderful, be it for the family or business.
4
booked using chope and reservation was confirmed immediately. the service is good as usual, especially today as my child spilled a bowl of sauce onto the chair and floor, the servers quickly helped to clear the mess and also replaced the sauce without us asking. the food is great, especially the meatballs and chicken thigh skewers. were very disappointed on the chicken wings as they were not fresh chicken, have the frozen chicken taste... another sad point-they have stopped issuing the loyalty card-this will make me not to return so frequent as no potential discount in future.
4
Went on a Saturday late afternoon, the place was not very packed, hence the service is very fast and excellent. Tried the skewers, saba fish, popular croquette, udon and bento set. I will have to say that I will visit the place again! The food is so delicious
4
Another nice Japanese restuarant we frequented often. The young Japanese engineer first time to Singapore thinks the taste is very close to what he tasted in Japan. Yakitori is nice and reasonable price. I espescially like tawa (chicken skin in salt). Surprisingly this Sunday not crowded and we could get a table.High ball is nice and went well with yakitori.Enjoy!
2
If not for the Groupon 50% discount I would not dine here. The food is very average and it's expensive fr the poor quality.The free cabbage was a novelty. The chicken yakitori was extreamly dry and could not be eaten properly.My waitress was rude and was a little too quick to clear my plates.It seems like there are constantly discount codes floating online for this restaurant. So might be a good idea to search it up online first before visiting. But for the price and quality of food I would still think twice. Not recommended at all
4
First time trying this with my friends. It serves great grilled skewers. We ordered chicken thigh and garlic butter mushroom skewers. As for main course, we shared some chicken set. Lastly, the goyza was not bad too! As a starter, they also serve raw cabbage with a special sauce but the cabbage seemed too raw for me..
4
We had a quick early dinner here with the kids.
Food was very good, and not too expensive.
The place was very busy - obviously known by locals!
5
it's a little bit more expensive than the hawker places, but food is fresh and delicious. The yakitori is of course terrific, as is everything else on the menu.
4
Value for money lunch sets with happy hour beer :) Semi-automated service, prices are a little on the high side but expected for japanese restaurants. They do very good yakitori, and will recommend their grilled salmon mentai and chirashi don too!
4
If you are craving for yakitori, this is the place to go. We ordered a variety and enjoyed them all. The bonus was that on Wednesday, drinks are free for the ladies.Reservations are recommended as the restaurant always look full whenever I walked by, including the evening when we ate there
4
We visited the restaurant at lunch, Sumite Yakitori House has selection of lunch sets. My set has very tasteful. The Good humored waiters give us a iPad to order the lunch, the iPad have an app to see the food, drinks and before order we can see the amount of the billing and if everything is correct.
4
It was after 9:30 or 10 at night when almost all the food joints were closing in the Bugis st although they allowed us and it was my first ever encounter with Japanese food and I liked it so much. Comparing Singapore restaurants rates of this one is pretty ok and the food and presentation was quite commendable. The staffs are friendly and helped us while ordering our food. The ambiance was good but at the late hours it was quite noisy as most of the customers were drunk at that time. One partially cooked dish they served on the table on a stove which took few minutes to be done to eat. I forgot the name but I really liked the idea
5
Visited this tucked away restaurant in Bugis Junction for dinner. I came to know this restaurant from a blogger website and this restaurant originated from Tokyo with numerous branches in Japan.Was told that there is a 2 hours restriction to complete dinner during reservation. Reached the place at 630pm and it was almost 75% full. The wait staffs greeted us warmly when we entered, our waiter gave us one potato appetiser($8.90 , taste great with flowing egg yolk surprise!) recommendation. Orders are self serviced using ipad. One plate of great tasting cabbage with special Japanese salt was given. We order quite a number of skewer to try: chicken shoulder w shio(must order, juicy and crisp) , chicken liver in sesame oil (one of the best) , chicken heart in sesame oil , beef, Tsukune ball with mayo and cheese for men(big n juicy) , prawn, beef with spring onion (great),more beef x2 with teriyaki sauce , grilled avocado(nice), grilled brinjal(nice) , pork belly (so so) , quail egg wrapped with bacon(nice), corn(ok), tori soup (average) , udon with egg foam(average but fun to eat as u can't see the ingredients) , a Sapporo beer and a soft drink. The bill comes up to $112 for Two persons and both my Wife and I came out with satisfied stomachs and for this bill amount it is considered cheap in Singapore as compare to some other well known yakitori restaurants.Recommendation: go solely for the skewers and the potato appetiser (fried one with egg yolk in the middle) Pro: friendly service , short wait time for food items, staffs are friendly , environment is well ventilated so you won't smell like a stick of skewer after your meal, affordable. Beer comes ice cold. Patrons including some Japan expatriates so the food must be authentic in taste Cons: some misses in food items like the udon(too mild in taste)
5
I love the atmosphere in this restaurant; it gets packed around dinner and is filled with the joy and merry of diners. The food is great, the waiters are friendly, attentive, and helpful, and being there just makes you feel good in general. The set meals are well worth the price, as they contain a variety of food which should fill you up
3
So great place. Nice atmosphere. Nice iPad concept & service. but portions really too small. The skewers are small portions but okay for the price. What was completely unacceptable was the beef don - one skewer order of beef had more beef than the entire beef don!!
2
Visited for dinner at about 2100 on a Monday night and was one of only a few in this restaurant. Ordering is by using an IPad which is not that straight forward and my froze halfway through my order so had to start again with another one. My chicken pieces were overcooked and dry and the other two dishes were small and not very tasty. Staff seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves than servicing the few customers that were there. Maybe that's why it was nearly empty. Would not go back as there are other options locally
5
Great yakitori with a very large selection of different skewers. Ordering is done via iPad and the service is very efficient. Good drink selection too.
4
Tried the outlet at the ICON on a Friday night. Good range of foods and Japanese beverages. Service staff was well trained and friendly.Highly recommend if you have the budget at least $35 per pax to have a filling stomach.
4
Sumire is a chain of yakitori restaurants in Japan. The Singapore branch has been operating for a while and I finally ventured into the restaurant. The food here is pretty good and I was not disappointed at any of the dishes I ordered (taste wise). The yakitori sticks were nicely grilled, the udon was good, the korokke was good. The only grip I have is that for $2-4, the yakitori sticks were much smaller than the average ones in Japan, probably about half the size. So if you are eating yakitori, you have to order a staple or risk a rather hefty bill. Big appetites can easily down 30 of these and once you add drinks and other stuff, you are faced with a $100 per head bill.... But we spend only $20 per head.So, order wisely, and order other items, not just grilled sticks of meat and veg
4
You have eaten sushi with the rice grains dropping like Hansel was leading you back home.You have eaten sashimi that tasted like it was a crime scene relic from months ago.Or perhaps that miso soup boasting it was Japanese but you found "Bak Chor" (minced pork) in it!You will not find any of those here. Though one of us didn't like the salmon mentai, but I thought it was ok.Of all the dishes we ordered, each was graded around the table an Ok to Excellent. None of them was below par, which was a fairly great deal I must admit.Coupled by the relatively speedy serving, I thought the place was rather fantastic, with great food and fast service.The only thing I don't like was the speed at clearing my plates. The reaching across my face while I was eating to reach that plate across the table so that you can go home on time. That - is a no no.But in general, I will definitely return for more great food.Advice : Place your order in batches via the iPad. because there are just too many items to choose from and if you are going to collectively order and then send it, the restaurant may be closing. And then you will experience what I went through when they would be dying to clear your plates
3
Read that some people have raved about this place and its maki's but honestly it's just standard quality casual Japanese fare here in Singapore.That said, it's dependable and consistent. The menu has all the usual suspects and meets the local palates here who demand a lot of salmon don and rolls.It gets busy at dinner but lunch is pretty relaxed. The sets are great value
4
Upon entering this outlet, I felt transported to rural japan. Small tables, wood flooring and flags decorate the interior. We ordered the sashimi set, squid and some maki. We thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of the Makis that went well with mayonnaise. The squid was not too bad. The sashimi was average but not a let down at all. The price is slightly above average. But most of all, we thank the friendly staff who are quick to help us find out what is in the food, and its names
4
When we looked at the prices, we thought we walked into a wrong restaurant: we were looking for a good place to spend our weekend and we had a bit of budget for the meal. We were adventurous and decided to try this place, and the prices turned out to be pretty good value for the food - it's not spectacular (and there's no chance you will get Michelin quality food at these prices), but it met our expectations for a decent Japanese Restaurant, and at good economical prices.No regrets and we will be back. Good food, excellent prices (for Singapore)
5
The service levels here are excellent compared to some larger chained restaurants in Singapore whose name I shall leave out. Food is excellent and the best Yakotori in Singapore along with the rest of the other options available. I took a friend here and they really enjoyed it. Make it a must to try
4
I have visited this Yakitori restaurant at least 4-5 times and I am so impressed by their level of service efficiency and quality of food! All the yakitori sticks, other food items and drinks can be ordered electronically via an Ipad, without even bothering the service staff. Their meat balls, chicken with leek, chicken soft bone, chicken shoulder, oyster mushrooms with salt, cherry tomato with bacon Yakitori sticks are excellent! I also like their cabbage with Japanese salt dressing, homemade potato croquette (very unique and suitable for 4 pax sharing) and Tori Karaage with Oroshi Ponzu are also unforgettable selections! Dinner time tends to be quite crowded, it is good to make reservations ahead
3
Of course the plain grilled chicken with or without sauce is good. Difficult to miss it unless you undercook it. Where you catch the very good yakitori as opposed to the average one is when cheese or mayo comes into the equation. And in Sumire it is not a successful addition : skewers become greasy too much mayo cheese not grilled enough.... It is ok to go here for a quick lunch, it is average/good but avoid complicated orders
