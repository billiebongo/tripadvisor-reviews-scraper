Beer joint with great import beer on tap (Lervig Check In IPA very tasty) and local craft breweries on bottle. Latin music which isnâ€™t a favorite but the beer weighs over.

Ate and drank in here a few times. They do a good range of German beers which are excellent. Very friendly staff. Very well located in Robertson Walk and close to river.

The position of the pace itself is located is already more than enough to go and have some drinks.
However, thanks to the staff, this is the ideal place where to start you Friday or Saturday night if you want to do late.

Great value beers on tap, had some AFL footy on as well. Didn't eat here so cannot comment on that side. Great little restaurants and activity in this area, little less hustle and bustle than Clarke Quay

This has become our local watering hole as the staff are consistently friendly and welcoming, the beer is great and cold, the chardonnay is wonderful, generous and cold too. They have a happy hour so the prices are good. It is a lovely place to sit and they play good music and it is a good people watching place. We have tried other places close by, but love the service here

Are you tired of paying close to $20, or more, for pints of mediocre beer?Do you want to enjoy fine German beers at honest prices on an early evening or weekend afternoon, in the peaceful Robertson Quay square? Then Amber Nectar is the place for you. $10 pints of excellent HB beer, attentive and pleasant staff, lovely place to hang out and have a couple with friends

We stopped for a bite to eat with our 3 kids. The beer menu and beers were excellent and the staff friendly.The food was terrible, nachos were corn chips with "cheese" sauce and salsa. The chicken burger was terrible. Tastier satay skewers can be found in Chinatown for half the price. Soft drinks were S$6 each

We had really high hopes for this place...Amber nectar is Aussie slang for beer afterall...but expensive drinks at yet another Singapore venue.Food however is another matter entirely.Kids had burgers which were greasy mounds. Nachos arent nachos...just corn chips with cheese sauce...no gucamole, no salsa etc. Steak was totally forgettable...a thin strip of overcooked beef is not a steak.Service was good...but thats the best positive I can come up with
