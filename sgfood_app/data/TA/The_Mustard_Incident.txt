Thereâ€™s lots of places to go on club street and this place is one of the better ones. Nice setup with tables and chairs rolling out onto the street too. Great atmosphere good drink and food options and decent staff. Makes for a good night.

Man in charge knows his beer. Happy to talk about preferences and offer samples. The front of house girls are great also

Came here for some beers and light food with some friends, the beers were cold and fresh, and the hot dogs we got were exceptional! I got the Frankenstein and it was packed full of tasty goodness. Inside it has a bit of a dive bar feel which I enjoyed, and the staff were great! Would come back again

As someone who is working in a hectic and stressful environment such as the PMO, The Mustard Incident has been an ideal location to unwind and let loose. The Mustard Incident's unique menu caters to each individuals taste buds with its range of delicious food. It definitely encompasses the Hawaiian spirit with its aesthetically pleasing layout as well as the chill vibe that fills the bar. In addition to that, I would like to give a shout out to some of the amazing staff. Like the saying, "The place is nothing without the people" Mustard's friendly staff go above and beyond to provide excellent service for their customers. A huge gratitude for Avery, Serena, Mickey, Brandon & Willem for the GREAT NIGHTS! A new favourite of mine and will be definitely be back more often!! :

 The Mustard Incident is the place if you are craving a nice sausage on a bun - or hot dogs for you Americans ... Lol! They also serve Hawaiian local meals like their loco or chili moco that will put you into a food coma. Kelly (the owner) also makes his own Portuguese sausage for a nice Hawaiian local style Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice breakfast for dinner.  For drinks, there is a nice selection of spirits including some rare Japanese whiskey and Kona brewery beer on tap. From what I heard, it is also a place to catch a few Hawaiians from time-to-time. I keep telling Kelly, he needs to have poke on the menu to make the beer go down better and bring more Hawaiians in ... Lol

After some pretty hectic days wandering Singapore it was pretty nice to chill out at The Mustard Incident. Watch some of the surfing action in the WSL while sipping a great dry gin martini. Kelly is a very cool dude who made al of us feel like Ohana. Mahalo Kelly, it is a great place to chill.

This is a great place if you want to grab a beer that's not necessarily Tiger (or you know, Tiger is good, too), and possibly chat up some friendly strangers. The atmosphere is a little bit louder than your standard bar but it's quieter than a club. What impressed me the most is the great service and the friendly servers. They have a good selection of beer but their mixed drinks are pretty good, too. I particularly suggest their old fashioneds

So glad I walked into this place! The beer selection (and the explanations by the bartender) was very nice. Ordered the Cesar salad which came with homemade sausage which was sooooo good, I ordered the hotdog with chilly on it. This was the best hotdog I ever had and the chilly (which won awards in the US) was just amazing! I definitely found an awesome place to come back to! Don't just walk pass this place or you'll definitely be missing out on an amazing experience

On first glance, the Mustard Incident doesn't look as flash as its neighbours, BUT, the staff, owner, food and beer are outstanding! Forget Tiger beer, these guys have a WIDE range of draught and bottle craft beers, including BrewDog Punk IPA, all the way from Scotland and a some very nice American IPA's, they even have VB and Little Creatures on tap! Burgers, dogs and the lasagne are all made in house and are real good.... give these guys a try, and you will be pleasantly surprised! I highly recommend this plac

Finding a good hot dog is not an easy thing to do in this city. Now the wife and I don't frequent Club Street often, as it is far to touristy. That being said we found ourselves down there last Friday after work and just wanted some beer and easy food. I love hot dogs, fries and beers, and this place has all three. A good happy hour beer with a large choice of different dogs and some nice crispy fries are what will be bringing me back here. They had sausages, real sausages...beef...lamb...frank-freakin-furthers. Not the usual local "chicken" mush meal mangled mung. The toppings are awesome as well. If you want a good dog in the CBD then I suggest you head over here
