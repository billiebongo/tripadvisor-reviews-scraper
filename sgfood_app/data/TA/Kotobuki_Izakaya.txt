Visited because of the Sakura Latte. The desserts are good for photo but tasted quite average, especially Sakura Matcha Latte. I am quite disappointed on that especially it is $9.9. Probably next time should try the food.

The one for one matcha set is a must try. With 9.90 (before gst and service charges), u got to enjoy two cup of ice matcha tea and donuts. Worth it.
3
There is a wide variety of choices. We order the cold soba and yakitori , and salmon rice. All not too bad.
5
I really enjoyed dinning here. They have Matcha fair now and tried some of their Matcha soba with tempura. So yummy. Also, we were given private room, which make it more enjoyable. Will visit again.

Ochazuke was decent but too salty sometimes. Matcha sizzling cake was visually attractive but matcha taste is not strong enough. desserts were quite pricey too

Restaurant was not packed at all which I only see 2 table with customers but I’m waiting for more than 20 minutes for my sashimi. While waiting my sake turns hot to cold which not nice to go with sashimi anymore. Staffs seems like aware that I’ve been waiting but none of them bother to come and explained to me why. Disappointed with the service. At last they do apologies thou.

Tried their sashimi rice, the raw salmon and the mayo salmon version. The rice is packed to the brim with meat, which despite the appearance of a small size, is really filling. Definitely worth the slightly more expensive size. The sashimi is also very fresh.Drinks portion is also very generous compared to other cafes out there.Huge variety of food between Japanese and Western choices. Quiet and cosy environment, though can get quite chilly. Only complaint is the pricing a bit steep. More than $25 per person. Will still come back though

We visited Kotabukl several times . Atmosphere is good. We had discrete private booths. Food is very good. Sashimi is beautifully fresh and well presented. Also charwen mushi, agadashi tofu, kingfish collars. Good sake selection and reasonably priced wine by the glass. 20% off during Happy Hour. Friendly and efficient service.Recommended

Visited to try their version of the sakura matcha latte however it was the weakness one I've tried. I only smell the matcha but the flavor was severely lacking and felt like totally not worth $9.90.My boyfriend's cold drip coffee however was lovely and so was the sakura cake roll we got to share. Might be keen on trying other drinks but the matcha latte was such a let down although it looked very pretty.Staff and service was good, friendly and fast for the most part
4
have tried their other branch in jurong - was good. quite authentic Japanese food. nice cosy resturant in orchard wisma - environment nice- was surprised they gave us a so call private room . service bit slow but was still acceptable. food wise- not bad and price is alright. had the match latte tea - not bad but wished it was much warmer.
5
The food was great, so was the atmosphere. The staff were all friendly and courteous making the dining experience wonderful!
4
Have a very plesdant and surprising good quality coffee. We ordered kotobuki blend coffee 2 ways. Hand drip and siphon. I prefer the hand drip as it is stronger in flavor. We also ordered mixed snack platter which can be improved in taste.
5
First time here. Was brought to our own private dinner space, atmosphere was good and staff were very attentive.
4
Given a small room but was Cosy. But think shortage of staff.. the food take v long to come and wrong food was serve.
5
The food is pretty good, price is quite reasonable as well. Will definitely return another time with my family.

They had a matcha fair and had bogo iced matcha drinks with melon pan and donut. The matcha drink didn't have a bitter after taste that I was hoping for and you could taste the syrup at the bottom of the glass if you didn't stir. For $9.90++ a glass, it's pricey. Service is good and if you make a reservation via chope, you get a private room! Highly recommended! Will be back to try their chirashi don in the near future!

I was looking for a convenient place to meet friends and remembered seeing Kotobuki Coffee in Wisma. Food - I had the Beef Menchi Katsu - a mixture of Beef and Pork balls deep fried set. Totally yum ! Crispy on the outside and tasty on the inside. The tomato soup of the set was a little thin and watery compared to the usual tomato soup. My friend had the Curry and found it good.Service - staff are quite attentive when they are in the seating section we sat at, but at times, they "disappear" into the kitchen area so it takes a while before we can order our meal or ask for water etc.Location of the restaurant is very convenient for shoppers as it is relatively quiet if you go early before the lunch crowd.Would definately return to this place.

We went for the Sakura tea set,the presentation of the tea and cake gave us a whimsical experience. The Swiss roll slice was nice, light and fluffy. I ordered the coffee which taste too milky for my taste but the taste of matcha was served with perfection
4
My girlfriend and I made last minute arrangement to Kotobuki Izakaya at Wisma Atria and to our pleasant surprise the service is at top notch. We requested for a private dining area, they make a point to accommodate our request on a Friday night; which I supposed is one of their busiest day. Food was served considerably quick and they were up to expectation.
3
Went to the restaurant during happy hour with my friend. Service was prompt. The fish nabe was very fresh and sweet. The potato mentaiko was lack of mentaiko mayonnaise. The Tonkatsu was very tender however the meat was not as lean as I would expect. Overall I think the Yuen Ching branch is better in term of taste.
4
Food-wise: We had the premium set, sashimi don and soba. Food was decent, yummy, though nothing spectacular.
Service: Sushi took awhile to arrive, but generally staff were friendly and attentive.
We requested for a corner table & we got it! Great ambience!
5
the place is great for friends gathering and the food is yummy~although the ramen can be hotter next time =)
4
It was a nice quaint place that had very nice decor and friendly service staff. The food was just okay, had a set lunch for $13++.
4
Food was not bad (ordered set meals), ambience was good. For the price paid and there was ongoing promotion for set meals, will consider coming back again.
4
Discount for happy hour is really worthy. Excellent service and value for money. Will be back to Kotobuki again!
4
I love their matcha tea latte! Hope its a regular on the menu. Although situate on buy Orchard Road, its located at the quiet pat of Wisma.
5
Service staff were prompt and we enjoyed our lunch! Only wished the hot green tea was not that light, it almost felt like we were drinking plain warm water.

The cafe is really really small. Food was normal but expensive. $15 for a Matcha latte and roll cake (no difference from Polar's roll cake), $7 for a very small scoop of yuzu ice cream. Low quality music box is sold separately at $18. Staff spoke Chinese to us straight when they saw we're Chinese. They forgot my friend's order and when we ask about it they told us that the staff didn't know which customer ordered the set so she threw it away.

Visited this venue while looking for a place to eat in Wisma Atria mall. The exterior looked inviting and the menu offered a wide variety of popular Japanese dishes.The interior was an interesting mix of wooden sign boards and hanging kettles. The space was small and tables were limited. Prices were reasonable and comparable to other mass market Japanese eateries. We decided on the fried pork cutlet set with rice, miso soup and dessert. The pork cutlet had a thin crispy coat over moist meat. However the batter should be thicker and crispier. The miso soup was too salty. We were not expecting a macaron for dessert.The side order of crispy fried shrimps were little crunchy morsels. We also ordered a Japanese clam soup. While it read "Japanese clam" in the menu, we've eaten enough to know that these were sourced from China given the shell pattern, taste and texture

Due to shortage of barista, I actually didn't get my order on my first visit (but the staff was rather apologetic about it, so I would still commend them on the good service). This time round, the food and drinks came pretty quick and the presentation was beautiful, taste was great too! Plus, the waitress gave some good advice (like recommending items to share when the portion is big). So definitely worth a re-visit
5
Was given a private room for the dinner. Excellent service, food was served farely fast. Was really surprised by the quality of the food given by the price of it. Would definitely go back again.

This place serves a mixture of different Japanese cuisine.
Price is very affordable. Quality is very average.
3
Service at the restaurant needs to be further worked on.
1 for 1 salmon sashimi deal is good. Fish is fresh.
4
food was good, but menu could be expanded a bit more, or integrated with the cafe side.
overall, great experience
5
Price is reasonable, food is delicious and portion is big. very value for money. will come back again.
4
First time dining. Review was good and so decided to try since location was what we were looking for. Very good food and we like the ambience as we were seated in a private area.
5
They have a wide selection of food and drinks that is similar to the eateries in Japan. Food was good and served very fast.
4
Went there with my sis for afternoon tea. They were having sakura theme special, a set with sakura roll cake, cappucino & merry go round toy. The roll cake was average, coffee is very strong (suitable for japanese coffee lover) and the toy was cute. We also ordered mentaiko pasta which was very good. The place was quite pricey though
4
Was attracted by the look of the sweet potato cake when trying to find a tea time place and decided to try out the Japanese coffee restaurant which has two areas one serving varieties of coffee n teas and the other servers Japanese cuisine. The sweet potato cake was an eye candy and tasted great for a light tea time experience. Though price slightly high side but the quality , taste n ambience of the cake was worth trying.
5
Order 3 of the promotion sets including the pork sukiyaki and 1 tempura udon. The taste was definitely a cut above those Japanese restaurants found in the malls. The ingredients were fresh and some of the vegetables were very crunchy. However a slight gripe would be the time taken for the meals to be served. Thus one should order some side dishes while waiting for the main dishes
