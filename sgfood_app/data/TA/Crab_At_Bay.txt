If you are looking just for good seafood and don't need a view then this is the place. The owner can accommodate any request you have in mind. Their signature dish is crab bihoon. They also have the famous Singapore chili crab.

After several days trying to track down the best and least expensive chilli crab, we were lucky to stumble on this place just 5 minutes from our hotel.Awesome.

Visited this place many many times and finally decided to write a review on it!The signature dish is Crab Bee Hoon and is simply fantastic. One of the best I have tasted here in Singapore! Never had enough of it! The Crab served is always so sweet and the Bee Hoon is well soaked with the sweetness and flavour of the Crab! Just yummy! (Best to pre-order the Crabs if u like big ones for yr Bee Hoon)In addition, this is a nice cosy restuarant with very friendly staff and boss! Always ready to make your meal there a pleasant one!A "must try" place for all Crab Bee Hoon lovers!

A hidden gem of an eatery serving mouth-watering seafood uniquely cooked Chinese-style. Lots of garlic are used and well suited to local taste. Uncluttered place and excellent service. The clams, Sri Lankan crabs, squids and deep fried salted egg salmon skins were yummy! The fish was steamed to the right perfection. So was its specially homemade seasoned guava pieces as appetisers. Dishes were savoury! A meal worth eating

Crab at Bay located at 548 Macpherson Road, Specialized in Asian Chinese culinary, Crab at Bay will delightfully excite you with succulent tastes. This is a pleasing neighbourhood seafood place. Down-to-earth and not somewhere u want to bring someone for a classy meal. Anyway if you are crab lover like myself, this place is great! It's the best quality crab meat in Singapore. Crabs are always super fresh, sweet and moist. We also had other dishes, and they all were scrumptious. But if u want great quality crabs in a pleasant no fuss environment then this is the place. Service was prompt given the fact that the restaurant was busy. However we had a truly delicious meal which was very reasonably priced. The food was of excellent quality. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. I shall return

Thought of trying a different seafood place after the usual places. Their "large" crabs were small and feel short-changed for the price. Only the pincer was of decent size but they claim each crab was 750 grams, which did not look it when served. The chili crab is done differently here, with a very fermented-prawn flavor "belacan", which may be good for others but definitely not the singapore style of chili crab. Pepper crab and the crab bee hoon were the better style of cooking and the salted egg crabs were ok too. The clams were good. My complaint is generally on the size of their crabs, it seems smaller than claimed and charged. I won't be coming back

The food was cheaper than those popular crab restaurants. Food quality was good. We ordered the crab with rice noodles, guinness beer spare ribs and vegetable. Very nice. Only 2 of us, it was nice we could choose the smallest portion of spare ribs and vegetable. The crab with rice noodles was too big for 2 persons. The crab was fresh in Singaporean standard. Of course, you would be able to find fresher crabs in Macau or Hong Kong or other places

The crab at bay is an unassuming little restaurant. It doesn't look like anything special and is next to another big seafood restaurant, but when we arrived it was busy with diners and people seemed happy with their food. We ordered a crab bee hoon dish and a simple vegetable long bean dish with chilli and garlic to go with it. The long bean dish was surprisingly fresh and tasty and had been cooked well so the flavours were evenly distributed and the mince meat was tasty enough to stand out. Then main course of the crab was served in a nice presentation and looked appetising. Thankfully it was as delicious as it looked. The bee hoon noodles were full of flavour and the sauce was a thick and rich with flavour. The crab itself was very fleshy and easy to manage. It complimented the sauce well and was very tasty. One minor complaint about the sauce was that it did congeal when it got cold so wasn't as tasty as when it arrived fresh and hot from the wok. Overall the atmosphere was pleasant without being great, but the the meal was tasty and it was pretty good value and reasonably priced, even with the addition of a few beers (even if the drinks selection was a little limited). However, this is a place I think it's well worth returning to.

Went there for the 1st time due to warm weather as the place air-con. Managed to secured a free parking lot ( free after 5 pm ) just outside the restaurant.Ordered the signature dish crab bee hoon but is disappointed on the tastes of the bee hoon which is quite plain tasting but the crab craws were large.The Guinness stout pork ribs is good. Deep fried soon hock fish is great but cannot compared with Crystal Jade's standard.The lady boss who has a singer daughter ( a 7th moon singer ), going around the small restaurant to mingle with diners but somehow missed my table. Or else, we will feedback to her on the sub standard crab bee hoon.Service level is so so. They accepts credit cards but not NETS payment.Though the restaurant claimed that they do not have GST & Service charge but they failed to mentioned there is a cover charge of $1.00 per pax, felt cheated when the bill came.Would I return to this restaurant again? I think it is no

You know how expensive crabs can be like $60 - $70 per kg?! Over here, you get 2 x 500g of crabs at $38. We ordered their signature style of cooking - crab simmered with bee hoon. Oh my, it was so flavourful. The crabs were really fresh and the meat were firm and to my delight with roe aplenty. The bee hoon, a sizeable portion, was super delicious having been simmered with the freshness of the crabs. We also ordered Guinness pork ribs and prawn paste mid-joints both at $12 each and portions are really small. The former appeared to be thick pork slices rather than ribs. Not much of Guinness influence. The latter is nice and not oily. I would recommend that you come here for crabs and crabs only.No service charge and GST. They charge $1 cover charge for each pax for wet towel and table cloth.
