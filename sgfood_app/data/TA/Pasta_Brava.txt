The risotto and squid ink spaghetti was good, other dishes was OK (seafood pasta, burrata cheese). relatively expensive for the price. wine was overpriced. Good and attentive service.
5
The atmosphere of the restaurant gives a very cozy feel. Pasta was amazing. Overall a good experience and definitely will go back again.
5
It was a rather lovely evening at Pasta Brava. The lady owner and the waitresses were really friendly and accommodating. We had a great time. Food was not bad too. Wouldn't mind coming back again!
5
Good food, good ambience, good service, good smile from service staff.
I will definitely be back!!!!

Have been visiting Pasta Brava for many years. Serve quality and delicious good as always. Love it..

Before the change of ownership we have been going to Pasta Brava for years. We loved the old charm and fantastic atmosphere. The owner Angelo and his team never disappointed our taste buds presenting home cooked authentic Italian dishes. They would even cook special recipes. The price and service, wine list and deserts were amazing and we loved spending whole evenings there. However, since Angelo sold the business the quality of food went horribly down. The bread is no longer a crunchy Italian bread or full of herbs focaccia. Our pasta was undercooked (and I know what it means al dente), sauces lost its authentic Italian taste, portions are smaller, prices higher, tiramisu was dry. It seems to be more of an Singapore version of Italian food rather than authentic as it used to be. We had one of the new waiters and we had to keep asking for refills of water. Although the restaurant touts they have one star Michelin chef, but in our opinion they would be better served retaining old chef along and his recipes. On a plus side most of the decor remain pretty the same. Unfortunately change is not always good in restaurant business if you want to keep old customers. We won't be coming back

Food was ok, not fantastic, given the price, especially knowing places that I can get better pasta with the same or lower price.Dessets were so much better than the main, given that we were full after our bread and main course.As some other posts have mentioned, service was not lousy but not attentive. During my visit, one of their dish served tasted spoilt, but the dish was replaced with another dish. There were some hiccups during my visit but eventually it was resolved after some struggle with the Manager. This is a place I personally will not revisit again.

One of the more economical Italian joints in the CBD, where you can have dates, work or family dinner, pasta Brava's menu can be full of hits and misses, though all of them taste above average.The space and decor are quite laid back, it's not too loud, so you can have a conversation among yourself without much ado and can spend a lot of time running though the menu items,The tastes are all very strong and hearty - the portions are good and so does the taste. Just don't try to compare the dishes with their counterparts from some of the other places in Singapore and you will be fine.Some of the dishes featuring cream and/or cheese can sometimes be quite heavy. Personally, I found the desserts too sweet (but then, I always find Italian desserts to be way sweeter than average).But, the ingredients are fresh, the cooking technique is commendable and the overall experience is good.Definitely recommended for casual dates
5
The service staff are friendly but not as attentive as other restaurants I’ve been to. The food is nice.
5
It was our first time visiting this resturant and definitely will visit again! First, we walk in with no reservation and despite being fully booked, the staff tried her best to get us a seat and Yes she did manage to squeeze in a seat for us ^^ Lucky Us!!staffs are very friendly and helpful , definitely will make you feel like you are at home. Especially David who will constantly check on us and see if we are good and need any assistance . He even shared with us some history of this resturant . We tried the homemade pasta and chocolate steak out of curiosity ( just got to try the weirdest thing on the menu. The Chocolate Steak had amaze me alot , never thought that chocolate can mix so well with steak o.o Definitely a must tried!
5
Old family run Italian restaurant with a quaint and cozy interior. Excellent food quality and a nice wine list to compliment the food
5
Waiters attended to us without delay and addressed our needs quickly. Was kind and polite in their tone too.
5
Really enjoyed eating there, crayons were very entertaining, food was unbelievably good and service was very prompt as well. Those potatoes and tomatoes were unlike anything I've ever tasted
3
Price is high, food is average. Service can be tremendously improved. Everything had to be asked for, from bread to condiments. Food also took a long time to be served.
4
Pasta Brava is cozy and sets you up for a mood to wine & dine. Plating is carefully done to visually gear you up for a great taste. So don't plunge in. Take a moment to enjoy the art. Then bring your nose close for an air feast first. Now you may go ahead and experience that delightful taste and goodness in your mouth
5
I dine here all the time with my date but this time I decided to bring my best friends over for them to try. From starters to mains to desserts - they were absolutely delicious. Friendly staff makes it all even better. We had lots of fun and laughter by our drawings on the table. They love it and will definitely come back
3
Pasta was too soft, felt as if its microwaved. atmosphere was okay. staff did not prepare happy birthday cake although i called in advance to tell them.
4
Was there with friends for a celebration, the restaurant manager and her team were very accommodating to our request and their food was delicious. Though it was crowded, the service crew made sure everyone was comfortable, attending to every request quickly. Reasonable prices with a good location. Would recommend to overseas friends to visit
1
Went as a company meal, easily one of the worst meals I have eaten in a long time.Atmosphere was non existent and as for the food well to sum it up steak and ratatouille covered in masses of dark sickly chocolate sauce, why did I order that you ask ? Part of a set meal plan that was organised.We had 25 people eating and drinking for approx 3 hours and when we were offered teas and coffees at the end of the meal one of my colleagues wife’s ask for a camomile tea as was told that would be extra as not part of set meal only breakfast tea. Unbelievable!!!Just avoid please
3
Went for a birthday celebration and hoped to experience a truly authentic Italian meal, seeing as my current “pasta experiences” were of the Pasta Mania and western restaurants variety. Ordered the highly raved mushroom risotto and squid ink pasta but honestly, even with my plebeian tastebuds, I was thinking: “ This is it?” They we’re very thoughtful to split the soup into two portions for us without asking and service was prompt and efficient- not outstanding though. For the price, I couldn’t recommend anyone to revisit again. Not value for money at all. Request to sit downstairs for a more lively and “Italian” atmosphere, and upstairs for a quiet evening.
5
Loved the ambience, very cozy and friendly vibe! Service staff were friendly and attentive :) the food was super duper!
4
We had a group business dinner on the second floor and it was excellent. Food was good. All of our guests from all over the world could enjoy dinner.
4
Food portion is huge! Service is good. But would be good if the waiters don't crowd around us near closing.
5
Second visit to Pasta Brava and the place is as awesome as always. Meals was perfect and service was really good. Thank you!
5
Attentive service, delicious pasta, and being able to write on the table are just some of my favorite things about Pasta Brava! Best dishes were the mushroom risotto and squid ink spaghetti. The only dish that I might disagree with is the pasta with duck ragout, which has pasta that stuck to each other. Not enough sauce and/ or olive oil! Otherwise, every dish was great :) corkage is 30++ per bottle
3
Nice decoration, but the food was only average and a bit over priced. Service can be better, most of time we have to pour wine ourselves and I didn’t quite understand why the waiters were so upset when they saw us helping ourselves....are we supposed to wait and call them?
5
Bustling place in Tanjong Pagar, it looks like entering to the Italian granma genuine place, the heritage deco gives a warm family feeling.We made a booking, upon friend`s suggestion and he was right, we arrived at 7:30 on a weekday and it was packed. However the accomodated us pretty fast. We got some antipasti to start (yummy Parmigiana!). My main course was a special Pasta with Saffron and it was awsome! Really tasty! I guess an Italian hand made it.Service staff was nice to us all the time and the owner (Sophie?) came to us to say hello, we really liked that!We are definately coming back
2
Really not good for Money value ? Can you make this evaluation process more complicated ? .. what the hell min 100 caractère 
4
The food is easy, nothing special in the menu and at the same time very good quality and taste of the food. The ambience is very nice too. Their reservation system is slightly weird. You call them up and they say no tables are available; you walk-in and there is no issue. LO

I am always trying out italian restaurants and came across this restaurant from the good reviews i read so i decided to give a shot. I booked a table for a Saturday dinner and when i arrived, it was pretty full house. We waited quite abit at the entrance for the host to “see” us and finally after 5-10mins standing at the entrance, she took us up the stairs to second floor for more seating. It was almost full house as well on the upper floor. I was thinking to myself it must be really good and was looking forward. We were simply provided the food menu and there was no introduction to their best dishes or specials and the server walked away after giving the food menu. Surprisingly i was also not given the beverage menu and had to ask a few times for wine list! We started with caprese, prawns in garlic oil, followed by seafood handmade pasta, beef tenderloin and ended off with tiramisu. Food was so-so and i cannot understand the hype. What made my evening worse is the service... there is NO service at all and i actually question one of the servers if they can take out the service charge as we were ignored most of the time, have to constantly seek attention to order a few glasses of wine or a wine list, given a basket of cold bread after starters were served and without olive or butter and always have to seek attention from the waiting staff for anything! What a nightmare! It is simply value for money for average not bad food but no experience. I won’t return.
4
Good fun, ok service. The host was friendly but the waiter who served us was not as courteous nor friendly.
5
Authentic Italian dinner without breaking the wallet!! Excellent choice for all occasions, cozy environment with good selection of choices on the menu. Service is top notch as well. Will definitely be back for more.
4
Food is good, especially the rib eye steak and their pasta. Although the food took quite some time to serve. Service is good. Nice place with good ambience too.
5
Great atmosphere, attentive service and food was very good from starter all the way through to desert. Highly recommended
1
They should eliminate the service charge since there was no service rendered. The servers never failed to keep reminding you of the minimum spending but do not even have the courtesy to change the utensils after each course. Did not offered plates when they asked if it was for sharing of the appetizers, even when we ordered 3 sides for 2pax. Water was not once refilled throughout the entire meal. Lots of servers standing idle, there's got to be at least 6 servers and in such a small eatery, you need to wait for 2mins to get one's attention. Bread offered, with no saucer for the olive oil and no vinegar nor butter was offered. There was no butter knife either. Would not recommend coming here

Lunched here on December 19, 2017.For a party of 8, we started off with 2 appetizer platters of cold cuts alongside 2 adds of burrata, bruchetta, and olives. I tried the cold cuts and they were decent. The rest of the party seemed to enjoy the burrata the most, adding that it's a rare good find outside of Italy.For main, I had the Grilled Seafood (but minus the squid) with Salmoriglio sauce. I hate to say this but I wouldn't order it again. Flavor-wise, it was barely appetizing. In terms of the quality of the seafood, it didn't feel / taste fresh to me. In fact, I think the best thing on the plate was perhaps the bed of salad. Other folks had the grilled sea bass fillet, the pan-fried Norwegian salmon, the grilled lamb ribs, and the gnocchi. Didn't hear any rave or gripe about any of these dishes, except for the gnocchi which I'm told was very good.Also had a generous serving of the Portobello mushrooms and it was absolutely scrumptious! Wished I had ordered it as my main; well, perhaps 2 servings of it. Everyone who tried it looked pleasantly surprised and kept returning their forks for more. I think this is the one dish that is an absolute must-have, no question about it. As for desserts, I would suggest the very refreshing and tasty mango sorbet. Two colleagues tried the in-house recommendeds (written on a chalkboard), i.e. coconut cappuccino and lemoncello cake with key lime cream. Feedback was that the former tasted odd, and the latter was so-so
5
The authentic Italian restaurant has won many awards. I like the paintings and portraits hung on its walls. The main dining hall is downstairs and the space upstairs usually hosts private events. It offers two seatings at dinner time.The food is great value for money. I enjoyed the mix-and-match pasta dish and the pan-fried salmon dish was fresh. Desserts were the ever-favourite tiramisu and a limoncello cake topped with key lime mousse, a combination of sweet and sour.The ladies who attended to my table offered fantastic service. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a casual dining cozy experience with tip-top service.
5
The ambience you soak in as you enter this Italian joint lends authenticity to this cozy restaurant. It offers two seatings at dinner time, so do take note as it can get busy. Judging from the numerous accolades the restaurant has garnered over the years (its awards take pride of place on its walls), customer loyalty is key to the success of this restaurant.In line with the homely atmosphere, paintings and portraits are scattered all around; on both floors of the restaurant. The space upstairs usually hosts private events but head on there for that quiet and peace.The food is good and great value for money. My mix-and-match pasta dish was heavy. My partner’s pan-fried salmon dish was fresh and appropriately spiced up with herbs. Desserts in the forms of the ever-fave tiramisu and a limoncello cake topped with key lime mousse offered a little combination of sweet and sour.This restaurant warrants a return visit

Wonderful ambience, nice place for a family dinner . The food was delicious - we had the risotto , lamb chops, gnocchi and chicken pasta for main course and each dish was excellent . The waiting time was well spent playing tic-tac and hangman on the table covers. Lava cake, tiramisu and the cheese platter were sinful. All in all looking forward to the next visit . Not to forget the moscato the whole family enjoyed. Want to feel pampered go there
1
Serving of foods is extremely slow. Have to wait at least 30 mins despite the restaurant not being fill. Food quality is just satisfactory. Not a recommended place to go for dinner.
2
A total of 8 pax, a treat from the boss. All of us enjoyed the antipasti (buffalo cheese, funghi, scallop). For main course, most of us ordered the saffron scallop pasta, which were nice. 2 of us ordered clam aglio olio ended up very disappointed as the texture and aromatic flavor of the aglio olio didn't meet our expectation and loaded with sand from the clams. Both of us did not finished the pasta and gave a feedback to the manager. The manager made up by treating us a dessert on top of the 5 desserts that we had ordered (tiramisu, lemoncello cake, lava cake). Desserts were of decent quality. The poor rating is merely for the clam aglio olio, the rest are of decent quality
5
Just went there for a wine pairing event. The food was cooked to perfection and each dish went very well with the corresponding wine served. The Iberico Pork collar was my favourite dish, with the beef ravioli a close second. The staff were courteous and very professional and would come round frequently to check on us.I highly recommend this restaurant
5
Pasta Brava's new owner Sofi has kept the old unique ambiance of the restaurant, kept the impeccable service AND improved on the food. Having been absent from dining at PB for a while, it was refreshing and delightful to be back and also to notice that many of the old staff was still there. We thoroughly enjoyed the Capesante Alla Cardinal Gratinate, the Carpaccio Di Manzo and the in-house made Raviola Con Carne de Manso Al Gorgenzola AND not to forget the Lava AL Choccolato and Limoncello Key Lime Mousse cake for dessert - all made by Sofi and just wonderful. All the best Sofi - we will be back sooner than later.

I had a reservation for 7pm on a rainy Monday evening made the week before and was on time for it, even slightly early. However, I presented the bill at 8.07pm once our dessert was cleared as they apparently needed to turn over the table. I wasn't informed when I made a reservation via chope that I was only given an hour to eat (isn't it usually at least 1.5hours?). Didn't see anyone waiting so means they probably overbooked their reservation due to the event they have upstairs. Food is good (so are a lot of Italian restaurants in Singapore) but terrible service considering the type of restuarant it is and prices charged
5
Reserved a table for 6 last week for a corporate dinner with one of my guests being vegetarian. Upon contacting the restaurant, they recommended us the Christmas menu, and to my relief, they were more than happy to customise one set to be completely vegetarian-friendly. We had the Lobster bisque, Pumpkin ravioli, the beef tenderloin with chocolate sauce (Spectacular!) and finally ending it off with a scrumptious tiramisu. Best of all, my vegetarian guest loved her gnocchi and her main of cheese-baked eggplant that we started sharing it around because it was that delicious. At first I was worried that she wouldn't have her fill but she was definitely full after. We ordered 6 bottles of wine to complement the great food and atmosphere. The Italian wine was superb especially when paired together with the menu. All in all, with the level of food and great customer service extended to us, I am thrilled of how much my guests enjoyed themselves and I will definitely consider more dinners here in the future
3
This is one of my favourite restaurant. However, the food quality did not 'Wow' me this time.As always after having paid so much to eat there, the service charge (which is exorbitant) is totally not worth paying especially when the service staff have bad attitude and grumpy faces throughout the evening, not one but all of them...some of them have been there forever which is probably why they feel that they are entitled to treat you with less friendliness
3
Following the advice of other reviewers, we asked for a table upstairs. Our table by the window was great and service started off really well. Our mushroom starter was outstanding, our caprese salad average. 2 of us ordered a house special pasta with scallops and prawns in a saffron sauce. Unfortunately that came so salty that we couldn't eat it and sent it back. The second iteration was much better. The others really enjoyed their pastas. And desserts were fine. Unfortunately service feel away halfway through: we had to chase for dessert menus and the bill and were never asked if we wanted to buy more wine when all our glare were empty. We would all go back despite the flaws
5
This is my first visit to the restaurant so I didn’t have any expectations. They were recommended by some business associates who went for their wine dinner event. Went with 3 friends and we each ordered a different dish but shared. I must say the food was excellent. We had Stracci, (my dish) Squid Ink Pasta, Iberico pork and sea bass. The pasta texture was just nice, not too hard or soft, the sauce wasn’t too creamy or watery. The squid ink was just as good if not, better. The Pork was tender and grilled nicely, there was some taste of herbs but fortunately did not over power the taste. Not exactly a fish person but the Sea bass was fresh. We were full so only ordered 2 desserts to share, Lava cake (came with a scoop of ice cream) and Tiramisu. Both were nice and I liked that the Lava came out nice and warm Staff and service were friendly and very responsive even though it was busy. Didn’t have trouble catching the attention for our orders for more drinks. Overall a pleasant experience. Will certainly go back for more.

I had ordered the half Boston lobster pasta ($39) and my niece had the crab meat and sea urchin linguini ($34.50). The pasta for my dish was over cooked and the freshness of the lobster was covered by the tomato sauce. My niece also could not find any sea urchin in her dish. It was a birthday treat for her and the evening was completely spoilt by the lousy food and poor service. Yes, the restaurant was packed and the service staff was swamped. But we found it hard to understand how the staff could give so much attention to the family of 8 diners seated next to us but completely missed us every time we called out to them or waved our hands to get their attention.
4
This is the first time we tried Pasta Brava but I'm not impressed with the portion or variety. We were a party of 5 females (and we're all small eaters!) and we found the portions small, unlike typical Italian fare, usually large and hearty. We had expected to see Pizza on the menu, but this is not served in this restaurant, for some reason. Taste-wise we won't complain, but we have had tastier Italian fare elsewhere, one that's more value for money. We may come back again, but this would never be first FIRST on our list.
5
Awesome Italian restaurant in the heart of Asian paradise. Every dish we had was fabulous! Highly recommended! We will be back !
4
Was there for dinner with a friend. We didn't order much, just a pasta each. We tried the aglio olio and a tomato based pasta. Both were very simple pasta but it was really good! Ingredients were fresh and portion wasn't too big.
4
Lava cake is good!! Awesome place for romantic dinner.
Great service and staff were attentive and friendly.
5
We absolutely loved the squid ink pasta and lasagna. Ambiance was great for an intimate birthday lunch.
5
It’s a very nice place to have dinner, especially for couples. The ambience of the restaurant is amazing, the food and services as well. The value of the food is priced reasonably, hence i think it’s definitely worth a visit!
4
Pastas are generally good. Environment can be quite noisy when close to full at the 1st level. If available choose the upper level where it’s more serene. This is where we head to for some really good vongole pasta.
4
Pasta Brava is definitely a must visit place if you are having a pasta craving. They have great vegeterian pasta options that are delicious as well!
5
Love this place.Love the ambiance of the restaurant.It is a great place with a homely vibeRestaurant serves up hearty authentic Italian fare at very reasonable prices but no pizza. The dessert Tiramisu is a must to try.This place is crowded even on Monday evening and the place get quite noisy when is packed.But is highly recommended for some good pasta
3
The atmosphere of the restaurant was great (as usual) and I was seated at the second floor with my friends. Water was served late, same with the complementary bread which was supposed to be served before the main dishes. Pasta and tiramisu was amazing. However, panna cotta was too stiff and inedible. I wish the service and food could be better on my next visit.
5
Our group of four had dinner at Pasta Brava on a Friday evening. Restaurant decor is romantic & pretty & youâ€™ll enjoy looking at the art pieces while waiting for your food to arrive. The appetizers were excellent - we ordered the oven-glazed eggplant with cheese, bruschetta & fresh scallops with bechamel tomato sauce & Parmesan gratin. For the mains, we had the grilled sea bass and lamb ribs - both dishes were equally good. For dessert, we could only squeeze in one serving of tiramisu to be shared by all as we were too full to eat any more. We were not disappointed.Our overall experience was enhanced by the great service rendered by David (@Goliath) who was efficient & cheerful - this is truly service with a smile
5
The place is still one of my favorite places for authentic Italian food. Value for money as well, although they did charge us another $2 for extra serving of bread
4
Had the burrata with parma ham and melon for a starter, which was good. Seafood and scallop pastas were nicely done, along with the lasagna. Managed to squeeze in the tiramisu, limencello cake and tartufo which were delightful compliments to the meal. Lovely meal!
5
The appetiser (prawn dish) its abit expensive for the type of prawns. Other than that, its one of our fav place to dine in.
5
Food was authentic and good. Waiter was thoughtful and pass my wife a cushion for her back when he noticed that she is pregnant
4
We have ordered the both Squid Ink Pasta and Crayfish Pasta. The taste of both pasta are well cooked and we will sure visit again for other Italian cruisine. We would definitely recommend for this who authentic Italian cruisine
5
I came to have lunch at Pasta Brava the first week it opened in 1993 and have been coming back regularly ever since. The last gap has been a while and new owners have taken over however we were delighted to find the same high quality and authentic food, great service and the genuinely friendly staff. It remains one of my all time favorite places to eat
4
Having enjoyed Italian food especially in Sicily, Naples and Tuscany, found the food and service here close to its origins. The decor, warmth and friendliness of the staff from welcome to send-off was what one would have experienced in a trattoria. The radicchio salad was excellent, the cheese and light dressing setting off the crispness of fresh ingredients. At $16 it's pricey for a salad but I really don't mind paying for quality. The squid ink pasta was a tad salty but al dente, and the chopped bits of seafood of the right size and quantity. My companion's cheese ravioli looked a red mess but the taste was unique and distinctive. Crusty bread was an excellent accompaniment and sparkling water concluded a delightful meal. Portions are Singaporean-sized, not the generous ones in Italy and the US so heartier appetites may need more than one course. We retired elsewhere for dessert as the small restaurant became crowded and noisier after 8 pm. We hear they have a full house every night
4
It has been awhile since my last visit and the place still remain very cozy. A place for good gathering surround with good ambience. Love the dessert especially the lava cake with vanilla ice cream! Overall would recommend this place to my friends and biz associate.
4
What impressed me was the service more than the food at first. The workers were enthusiastic and gave good suggestions. I was there for my birthday and it definitely did not disappoint. However, the portion of the dishes may be a little small for some people but it was alright for me as I am not a big eater. Would recommend their Ravioli and rissotto (be aware that the rissotto is a little harder than outside). Their Tiramisu and Lava Cake is not too bad too though
2
Serving the dishes were very slow and the attitude of the waitress needs to improve. We waited for almost an hour for the main dishes to be served. We waited for more than 30mins after we finished our appetizer and we were super hungry. One of the waiter came over and cleared our appetizer and even asked if we ordered our main course. I think he also see that we have been seated for very long. We asked the waitress twice, first time she answered 'ok I check', second time when we ask her again, she say that its their protocol to only start to cook the main course after we finish the appetizer. She even said that we should have told them during order that we want it serve all together. But how will we know the restaurant's protocol when we were not even given options (the waitress that took our order didn't even ask if we want the main dishes to be served together with the appetizer). She then apologise and say she will check. When finally the food is ready, she served us with a very foul face. What kind of attitude is this. Not even looking apologetic at all. We are there to celebrate my friend's hen's night but ended up spoiling her mood.
5
it was a birthday lunch for 2 nov girl friends. gracious lady boss got her waiters to serenade a birthday song. my girl friends were the queen of the day. thank you for the experience
3
Food was good. Love the pasta. Lamb was tasty. A bit pricy considering the portions we got from the ravioi. Love the bread.
5
So far the most legit Italian restaurant in sg! Had the crayfish pasta which was absolutely scrumptious to the last strand of spaghetti. Kudos to the waitresses for being so heartwarming and pleasant!
5
Excellent service right from the door step till we left the restaurant after the meal. Mushroom risotto was one of the best I've had so far in Singapore!
5
We had pasta, sparkling prosecco and dessert. Love the texture of the pasta and the warmness of the staff.
5
Just excellent as always. Food is lovely and the service is very good. Process reasonable. Cannot go anywhere better for Italian comfort food in Singapore
5
Love the lamb ribs that i had ordered and it's fun to draw using crayon while waiting for food. Love the place and will com again next time!
4
Good service, pasta and ambience. Service was good as well. Although food took slightly long to arrive as it was crowded
4
Was there two weeks ago to celebrate my birthday. Loved it that the restaurant was located in refurbished shop house. Our appetizers were ok, not the best but not the worse either. Had the seafood pasta, but changed the sauce from a tomato base to a white wine based, it was delicious, but I found the portion on the small side. My partner had the lasagne with minced lamb and he enjoyed it. Had a slice of the tiramisu cake , it wasn't the best but was still alright. Did not enjoy the bread though, found it too crusty.We were disappointed with the service, the service staff were not very attentive, my glass of water sat empty for quite a while before it was topped up. And it wasn't easy to get their attention for anything as well.Overall, it was an enjoyable evening, as we enjoyed the food. Can't say much for the service though. Needs improvement

Called 2 days before to let them know that I had made a reservation and it's gonna be a birthday dinner for my partner and I wanted to surprise him with a cake at the end of dinner. They said I just had to order a dessert from the menu and they'll bring it up for me with a "birthday pack". In the end when my tiramisu cake was served apparently they forgot about it. Called the waitress over because who would not be upset when I chose your restaurant out of so many other restaurants to celebrate my partner's birthday and it was so upsetting how my special yet simple request could not be done. Put my trust in them cos I assumed since this was quite a well known restaurant, such requests would be common and they'd definitely do a good one for me. She did a check and realised it was her mistake, and just went to prepare ANOTHER tiramisu cake with a candle on top this time. She apologized and walked off and come on, such service recovery. It's bad. What's the point of bringing me another of your cake when our moods for the night was already dampened? even though food was good, the service and care for customers' requests and all needs to be improved. Very disappointed.
4
Went there for team dinner and we felt like it was much better of a couple dating spot. Regardless, the food was good but service could be better improved.. our glasses were almost empty most of the time :(
4
service was a little consistent (food came out fast but took awhile to get extra bread and had to actively seek out staff to make additional orders) however the food was outstanding and well-priced! the pasta was cooked perfectly and the portions were just right.
5
Had the carbonara and the squid ink risotto, both of which were exceptionally good. Like most would have advised, never sign off your meal without the tiramisu.
5
We were there for dinner by friends recommendation and we couldnâ€™t help ourselves doing the booking for dinner again on the night after. There were lots of food in the menu that we would like to try more. Food was delicious!! Calamari, Chocolate beef, scallops as in appetizer menu, spaghetti meatballs, Beef tenderloin, Tiramisu, Chocolate Lava The atmosphere was great. The service was perfect!!! Excellent!
4
The ambience is super lovely! Great for dates or anniversary dinners. I ordered the crab & sea urchin pasta while my friend ordered the squid ink pasta. I personally preferred the squid ink as the pasta I ordered could have more flavour. Overall, I would still go back again to try other dishes
3
Very interesting place which provides chalk and white paper on table for you to doddle while waiting for work. As much as it kills time, not something that I enjoyed from an Italian restaurant. Food was served at a timely manner. However nothing was impressive to leave a memorable experience
4
Food was decent, the spinach and ricotta cheese ravioli, was most certainly handmade but could have been more flavourful. The special - iberico ham ravioli - was the best of the lot! But I think the icing on the cake were the waiters who knew their dishes well and were confidently recommending dishes according to our preferences. Homely place for a romantic dinner or a family dinner
4
Have been quite a regular at Pasta Brava since I knew about them. This trip I decided to try selections out of my ordinary... I think I will stick to what I know. The raviolis aren't exactly as expected BUT other than that, everything else is good :

My first visit and it claims to be the oldest Italian restaurant in Singapore...some 20 years! And it taste wow! The ravioli with beef and Gorgonzola cheese is the best tasting pasta I had for long while. The Burrata with tomato and ham was decent. The seafood and squid ink risotto was another wow dish! Wine from Sicily was good recommended by the server. Will have to come back for more. The price was friendly. The ambience was simple and it is situated in the old part of Singapore! Very close to the Duxton public apartments

Great quality pasta dishes! Paired with a very relaxing ambience and beautiful interior decorations. Let your creativity flow by doodling on the paper lining the table top while waiting for your food to be served. Appreciated the good service from the attentive and friendly waiters too. Perfect for a chill evening with friends and family :
5
Came here for lunch and was not disappointed. They had the lunch set which includes a starter (salad or soup), 1 pasta, ice cream and coffee/tea. We had some side dishes, calamari and portobello mushroom. Not too bad as well. Worth a visit!
4
Must go for couples or friends who prefer cosy atmosphere to have their meals. A great place to dine and wine. Plenty of choices to choose from the menu.
5
Very good authentic italian food brings us back to our europe trip months ago. Ambience and service were excellent.
4
Pasta was Good, though a little more white wine sauce would have made it better. Lunch set ice cream was quite pathetic in portion.
2
Had dinner with my husband and ordered a glass of Prosecco while waiting for the dinner. Our Prosecco had NO bubbles... I don't how long the bottle has been open... Dinner was ok.
5
I've been going to this place for 17 years, and it hasn't disappointed me. Amazing food, amazing people, and place. I'll be back.
4
I love the chocolate lava cake... its the best i ever have😋. The steak is great too. Nice ambience with friendly staff.
5
Beef ravioli gorgonzola is the best I've had and the tiramisu was divine (coming from a non-tiramisu person who would rather pick other desserts all day long). Squid ink pasta was good as I rarely have that as well, so it says a fair bit. A place that I would go back any day for a cosy meal.Wine pairing by the carafe was appreciated for those who didn't feel like having too much to drink
5
We decided to go for Pasta brava for a nice Italian meal and we weren't disappointed; the wait time for the main courses were very appropriate and gave us time to chat and the entire experience was very enjoyable. Food was superb, the ravioli in Gorgonzola sauce is a must tr
3
We walked in thinking that it's the best pasta in Singapore but I was a bit disappointed to find that their pasta does not taste like it's handmade and the cooking is a bit too fatty and cheesy for my taste. Don't get me wrong, you can still get a decent meal here but it's just that it's not the best pasta really.What's good is the Tiramisu. Staff was nice.
5
Excellent food with good atmosphere. Will definitely want to go back again. The deserts are superb especially the lava chocolate cake.
5
Came here after reading raving reviews online for my girlfriend's birthday and was not disappointed at all! Food were good!
5
This place provide good service and ambience is pleasant. It just like a fine dining restaurant but there cost is worth. Will definitely patronize again.
5
The food was great! Was loaded with people.
Staff was accomodating. Price is reasonable for the quality of food served
Looking forward for our next visit! :)

David who was constantly serving us was the best. He helped us w the menu & was so friendly. I will remember him! W a rose. Thankyou David!

Had a hearty lunch at one of the best and oldest Italian restaurant in Singapore. The quality of food is very good and those who have travelled to Italy will know that it's a proper Italian restaurant. Atmosphere is warm with lovely paintings adorning the walls. White tablecloths wrap the tables, not many restaurants do that any more, but Pasta Brava kept with the tradition. I love that they still kept with the white paper and chalk to doodle on, while waiting for our dishes. We ordered Squid Ink Spaghetti, Beef Ravioli in Gorgonzola sauce, Lasagna and Spaghetti Bolognese. We had complimentary Parma ham ravioli in brown sauce which is the special for the month and it's delicious and the saltiness was from the ham and no salt needed. Squid ink pasta is the one that set the benchmark for the delicious black dish in Singapore, a stalwart of 26 years. The beef ravioli was my favourite and also for the pungent cheese lover. Pasta is made fresh daily by the way! For desserts, everything was good. The best was the limoncello key lime mousse cake which the lovely owner personally refined it with more almond in it. It is seriously yummy and light!!! It is a must order. They've just roped in 1 star Michelin Chef Michele who is serious about his craft. He's gentle and soft spoken, very unlike a celebrity chef who is loud and commands attention when he steps into the room. I'm looking forward to trying more of his delicious creations. Pricing is very good and it has not changed since Chef Michele joined the restaurant and we hope we get to enjoy more solid Italian food at affordable prices.I understand that there will be interesting menus coming up, so stay tuned to Pasta Brava. Bravo indeed!

Had lunch with my friend who recommended the restaurant and I was not disappointed. We had the seafood linguini and crayfish pasta. The pasta was cooked just right; the sauce tasty without over powering the seafood which was very fresh (certainly didn't have the "frozen food taste" mentioned by some of the reviewers"). We had wine by the glass which was not bad either. The decor is not modern but gives a very cosy feel. Overall a good experience and would recommend a visit at the least
4
Our family have been going to the restaurant since its early years. The food and service have always been consistent. Some of the staff have been there for so many years that even after a lapse of some time not going there, they still remember you and say hello, how are you?I always like their homemade pasta especially the spinach ravioli. Desserts are great choices. Panna cotta and tiramisu are consistently good. A joy to visit
4
Went there for my 4 year old Daughter birthday celebration. Overall food was fine, but felt the squid ink pasta taste not as flavourful as I first tasted it. Service staffs were attentive and were very sweet and got my little girl a helium balloon as a little gift.
4
The dining experience to Pasta Brava this time was just as cosy and enjoyable as my previous visits. The foie gras antipasti never fails, and the risotto was the star of the show, as predicted. The service of the servers were top notch, and and our plates were cleared quickly after each course. On a side note, I sent in an email prior to this dinner date requesting for a slice of cake to celebrate my husband's birthday but it was never presented. It was indicated in my email booking but sadly, I was left disappointed because my husband truly enjoys dining in this establishment. And how lame would it be to remind the servers about it in front of my husband if it were meant to be a surprise? I found this oversight bizarre as a few tables away from ours, a couple was presented with a slice. I was expecting to pay for it like last year, and more than glad to to do so, although I would think a restaurant should not be stingy with small favours like this to keep the clientale happy. Anyway, do make a booking prior to your visit for comforting Italian food
5
Excellent food. Loved the ambience and decor. Most of all loved the service. Food was served fast with attention to customer service. The food was very delicious.
5
Love the risotto! Hard to find really tasty one! My friend had to option of choosing red sauce over the swuid ink one on the menu!
Definitely come back again!
5
The pasta was just right, ambience was perfect. Price is on the affordable side.
Definitely will go back again!
5
The food are awesome and the staffs are friendly and polite. We ordered the recommended risotto al fungi and the ravioli, they are really good. The tiramisu dessert is tasty too. Will definitely go back to pasta brava.
3
Good food, Nice ambience, Friendly staff that accepted the last minute to our reservation. However, the waiter that serve us the menu wasn't friendly - he blackfaced us when we only ordered the main dish and nothing else. That destroyed the almost wonderful dining experience.
3
The setting and location are excellent, but the place was underwhelming. The food was just okay and expensive for what you got. The staff was friendly and professional though and the area is super hip and lively.
5
Highly recommended by colleagues, so I went there last night and had dinner. The restaurant opened since 1991 and my best friend has been there for many years almost a few times a month.. So this time I went there with him. The food always home cooked n consistently delicious n fresh . It is very value for $ that's why he always goes back for many years. I am planning to take my family there this weekend. The location is good and place is cozy, lovely. It's good for either events or romantic couples. Oh, their Limoncello cake dessert is awesomely amazinggg .
5
It is one of the best Italian Authentic place with a homely vibe. We really enjoyed the food. The place is cozy. Staffs are well trained, friendly without being too intrusive, and they are very familiar with the offerings. There are a lot of Art on the wall. Second floor is suitable for private events or dinner and also has very nice mini bar. I was having their famous Calamari and it was amazing. Overall, it was a lovely dinner for my family. Will definitely go and eat again

I've probably eaten here about 5 times over 10 years. This time was a romantic meal and the ambience was very pleasant as was our waiter. Unfortunately things beyond to crack almost from our arrival. The menu says soup of the day, but apparently every day but Saturday. Still, with 4 other soups on the menu that didn't cause any major damage. The first wine chosen was also out, and given the very small wine menu (very very very small) this was a surprise. The waiter then brought another which was not extra dry, making me wonder at the training they receive when making recommendations. If an extra dry sparkling is ordered, and there's a second on the menu with a similar lack of sugar - bring that. He just seemed to guess. Ultimately the one we replaced it with was very pleasant but the shortness of the wine list may be deliberate - if so then the strategy is vulnerable if they're going to be running out of stock. My wife ordered a spaghetti arrabiatta but penne arrived, which meant that I ate my veal alone, which is really disappointing. Mistakes can happen, either in hearing or writing, but It made me wonder why repeating the order back isn't simply best practice and borderline compulsory at all good restaurants. Lastly, while some courses were an excellent size (the spaghetti was generous) the average was a little small - notably the soup and caprese salad. Both were excellent but just slightly small to give the impression of value. Etna, around the corner, seems to strike that better balance. The waiter worked hard, though his knowledge of the menu and wine was not great, although he did take the time to inform us of the favourites from the dessert list, where he seemed on surer ground. We enjoyed the experience, but it was just marred by a few small errors, and a lack of attention to detail. It's a nice location, the menu is massive and filled with the classics, but the small wine menu is surprising. Perhaps they're simply constrained in storage place. This was the most disappointing of my 5 trips and everyone is allowed one off night, so my scores a more an aggregation of my visits than specific to this one

I'm a huge fan of veal cooked Italian style but find that a lot of Italian restaurants in Singapore don't serve veal and those that do, don't do it well. Pasta Brava, however, serves a good selection of veal dishes and the ones I've tried are great. My favourite is the veal scallopine. It's a very comforting dish for me, no frills, just perfectly cooked veal, gravy, vegetables and potatoes on the side
5
Very quiet and cosy ambience, suitable for small groups of close friends or romantic dates. Food was really tasty!
4
Had a wonderful lunch with friends yesterday, recommended by 1 of them working nearby. Good ambience, nice food at reasonable price. Ingredients used are fresh, worth paying. Staffs are friendly too. 👍🏼
4
Was our 4th visit there in a year. Food was good as usual but they wanted to charge us for an extra order of bread which I thought could have been given complimentary.
5
Enjoyable time and food at the restaurant. Servers were pleasant and knowledgeable.food was served prompt
5
My 1st visit to the restaurant with my colleague. Wonderful place the moment I stepped in. Comfortable ambience, cosy lightings. Next when food served, my carbonarra pasta was yummy. Rich authentic Italian taste, generous n fresh ingredients for the price paid. Reasonable portion. Lovely! Went level 2 to hv a look. Can be Private, romantic n serene for small groups or even couples. Also suitable for solemnization with all lovely people around u. AwesomeToo bad, I'm married Adeline
5
Dined here with my Husband for the first time, after hearing all the praises. We had the grilled prawns and beef carpaccio to start. The beef carpaccio was presented nicely and the prawns were delicious. For mains we tried the grilled seafood platter, squid ink risotto and beef ravioli. The seafood was tasty and grilled to perfection. Service was attentive yet not pushy. Very professional and timed well.Will be coming back soon for sure, thank you
2
Been hearing rave reviews about this establishment. Tried it yesterday night and it's really under expectation. Ordered a bottle of wine and the waitress took ages to try and open it, in the end she can't and passed it to her colleague who helped her to open it. The way she poured the wine was like pouring water.Calamari was ok but abit soggy. Nothing to rave about the tomato sauce, could do with a little spice. Ordered a prawn appetiser and the prawns were soft and mushy (not fresh, definitely frozen prawns and they should call it shrimps btw) . However, the kind waitress waived it off for us. Cream sauce saffron pasta was good. Crayfish pasta was dry and fishy. Salmon dish was normal and acceptable.Hygiene: saw a waiter preparing a knife and fork set for a customer and saw him using his thumb and finger, went through the knife twice. He could have used a napkin to wipe the knife instead... Lastly, made a remark when reserving that it's my friend's birthday and was hoping they could surprise her with a small slice of cake like they did for other table but did not get it... Total bill around $230 for 3 pax. Can get ur money worth better elsewhere
1
My seafood squid ink pasta came with raw and almost uncooked seafood- mussels, clams, and crayfish. I tried to explain this to the floor manager, but he responded with a snide remark saying: "if you knew it was raw why did you still eat it?"I was taken aback and certainly did not expect raw food and the level of service from one of Singapore's top restaurants. Basically the squid ink pasta is completely black, and i simply couldnt see if anything was amiss. He then mentioned that he would check this with the chef. I waited for 30 minutes but he never returned. Twice he walked pass our table and avoided eye contact.Finally when the bill came they offered a 10% discount on my $140 bill that i thought was an incredible joke. My anniversary date was really ruined by my experience here. I have been here 4 times but I am never coming back agai
5
Have frequented this restaurant many times ... the food is always consistely good to a high standard and the service always wonderful and discreet.Although been here for many years it never has lost its standards or quality. Good wine list Will continue to dine here
5
We had the stracci al gamberi e capesante and risotto al funghi porcini. It is one of the best pasta dish I ever had. First time eating a proper risotto and I think it had set a very high standard to beat for the future risotto dishes if I am going to have elsewhere
4
My second time there, their pasta is still as good. Strongly recommend anyone who's looking for good pasta and Italian food.
5
Definitely good for a couple's dinner. Great atmosphere and service. The wine is not that expensive and definitely you should try their appetizers.
4
good service and good food.. ambient is good. Recommended to go for their food and place for chit chatting
4
I've been visiting Pasta Brava for years now and you know you can't go wrong with the food choices. The day that I visited for lunch at 1pm, half of the homemade pasta choices were sold out.
5
Food is always good at reasonable price. House wine from Monte Pruciano is good as well. Always full house, better book on chope.
4
It seems we where in Italy when we discovered the cuisine of this fine restaurant. Great pasta dishes, homemade, apetizers, deserts and specially the wine. The atmosphere is cozy and the service is profesional and according to expectations. I beleive is perfect for dinner dates or inclusive business. Important to make a reservation before; it gets fully booked
4
its a cozy restaurant that is very inviting. I went with my family of 11 of us. The kids had chalk to colour and draw on the table, which kept even the adults entertained. I had the spinach tortellini, a yum but wasnt enuf for me....it was like 15-18 pcs i guess....so the portion is not huge but its tasty. My husband had the lamb, wanst too bad. Loved the baked salmon pasta, it was delicious. It has a romantic ambiance and i loved the staff. Catherine did a great job. The only issue was, even though i had reserved, i had a 45min wait. We waited at this waiting lounge on the second level. So, it didn't seem too long a wait as we were seated
4
Visited Pasta Brava last night with my husband for dinner. We started with bruschetta, caprese salad and sautÃ©ed prawns with butter. My husband also had a tomato soup which was really good. All in all, tastes were full layered and whole, and we enjoyed every bite. My squid ink seafood pasta was generous in portion and I liked that there was ample seafood in it. Service was friendly and attentive. We would have stayed for dessert, however, until the female service staff who were clearing our table asked if we would mind going to the lounge for our dessert. In front of us, the other staff were putting empty tables together to prepare for a huge dinner party of perhaps 12-14. It was clear at that point they needed our table as there were 2 chairs laid out at the end waiting for a table. I didn't really feel like moving from my table for dessert but certainly felt the pressure to give my table up. Would like to return to enjoy the dessert one day
5
we came here for birthday dinner, love the atmosphere here very romantic with italian classic music. I ordered homemade pasta : stracci ai gamberi e capesante (thin pieces of fresh pasta with scallops, prawns, green peppercorn, white wine, with saffron cream sauce, really good cost me $24 (plus additional 17% tax). They also provide colourful chalk on the table so we can draw something while waiting the food to be served.
5
Best-tasting Italian restaurant in Singapore! Some done it too deliberate, some compromise on ingredients, some too costly and some come with limited menu. PASTA BRAVA strike the right balance and their friendly staffs left a deep impression to my guests. Hope they open new outlets in the future
5
Nice place for a family dinner , cosy restaurant with great service, the price is not expensive except wine corkage is chargeable
5
Love the food here. Service was okay. Special mention goes to the buttered shrimp appetizer that I ordered (I forgot the italian name). I also love the ravioli. I'd definitely go back to try the other items on the menu.
4
Very comfortable dining experience with a laid back experience. Good quality is consistently good. Pasta Brava always delivers!
5
Italian food prepared well in a fine setting. Cozy friendly ambiance. We had a fairly large party, yet service was prompt, and attentive. This is a nice place for a special night out. Dessert was good.
5
Without a doubt this was my best culinary experience I've had in Singapore. A beautiful restaurant with excellent service and outstanding food. The carbonara is to die for. I will definitely be coming back next time I am in Singapore.
4
This was the second time we had visited the restaurant in the past week and the reason we returned was because we were very impressed the first time we had dined there. On the first occasion the quality of food had been very good, particularly the sea bass and ravioli,and the value was reasonable. However our last visit was disappointing. After the starters my son had Lasagna and found it to consist,in the main,of just cheese and was somewhat flavourless. I had the veal in breadcrumbs with Parmesan and Mozarella. Unfortunately the veal had been overcooked and was very dry and tasteless. My wife's ravioli with ricotta which was fine. Although overall I have given the restaurant a rating of 4 on the second occasion it would have scored only a 2/3 at best
3
I visited Pasta Brava three years back and it was so good. But three years down the road, everything changed for the worst. Service was poor, food was average. When we stepped into the restaurant, no words were spoken from the host. I told her I had reservation for two at 7.30pm. She picked up menus and turned her back without a word. I stood there dumbfounded and refused to move until she turned back and signaled for us to follow her. May I ask, which host ushers their guests into their seats without first greeting them?She then places the menu on the table and left. They didn't even provide the wine menu. Is it because I wasn't in my heels and my partner wasn't in his smart shirt and pants?We ordered portobello and also a scallop appetiser. And also a cream of mushroom, mains we ordered vongole and some seafood pasta (which I request to have it the aglio olio style). First, the scallops came, followed by portobello. Both were okay. Then the cream of mushroom never came, apparently they didn't even key in our order for that. The pastas took a long time to come, we were so famished and frustrated by then.Cream of mushroom was diluted and thin. Vongole pasta was bland and no taste and sight of white wine. Seafood aglio olio was tasteless. A certain fast food chain pasta store would easily be better than this. Tiramisu was disappointing too.I left feeling I've wasted almost $150. Did not enjoy the food, did not enjoy any service and did not indulge in the ambience at all.People should think thrice before setting foot in the restaurant, it's not worth the monies at all. It was so much better three years ago. Buck up, Pasta Brava
5
We had a great dinner at Pasta Brava. The restaurant has a warm homely ambience and the service was excellent. I especially liked the Calamari Fritti, traditional Caesar salad, pan-fried tenderloin flavoured with white wine, green peppercorn and Gorgonzola cheese as well as my favourite Chocolate lava cake.
2
We came back after 1 month and my remembrance of the wonderful food that we enjoyed the first time unfortunately this time was really not the same thing.The starter "Antipasto Misto" it looked liked the picture of it, 8 numbered ultra thin slices of cold cuts, price above 20 $, the wonderful risotto with Porcini that make come back this time was a different thing, totally with no flavor and the texture was not acceptable, the person that was with me order a pasta with sea food, what we received was a tomato pasta with 1 mussels and a small cray fish, im not complaining about the portion but about the taste if you order something with sea food the flavor must be of sea food
3
Came here today for lunch , and once again opted for the set lunch at $30++. Choice continues to be very limited for the set lunch: today I had the barley soup with the sea bream, a scoop of vanilla icecream and a coffee. Quite decent value for money, just would be good to have a slightly wider choice. Efficient service and no problems getting a seat without a reservation at shortly after 12pm
4
Food was good but nothing spectacular.
Ambience and service were top notch though.
Would probably go again but not often.
4
My office mate brought me here to treat me for lunch because it was my birthday. The vegetation ravioli is delicious!
4
Recommend their homemade ravioli, eggplant and scallops. Both the cream and tomato based ravioli was done just right. Not the best but still delicious homely Italian food.
3
Food was good. Squid Ink pasta was delicious. However, service was very poor. Instructions given to the waiter was not followed-up on despite numerous reminders
4
Booked this place for a decent dinner with my ex boss for thanking him helping me over the years. Food was nice and dessert was superb. Worth to visit. Price is average.
5
Was for a friend's birthday and they did surprised her with a slice of cake and candles. When I wrote it under the intructions section.
5
The pasta was excellent. I had the half-moon pasta with pumpkin, and my friend had the ravioli. The garlic prawns were also quite good. The service was not extremely warm but quick and reliable. The ambience was extremely comfortable.
4
Good service, nice creamy pasta done just right, reasonable prices for the quality. Will definitely come back again.
4
The ambience make me felt like we are back in Europe. ordered roasted bread with tomatoes as our appetizer. it was amazing good. had Risotto Al Funghi Procini and Pan Fried beef Tenderloin. The risotto has a very rich mushroom taste and the beef tenderloin was cook just nice. do make a reservation before going there. we went on a weekday for dinner and the place is full
3
I frequently come across the name of this restaurant when I look for Italian restaurant in Singapore. I finally found a chance to visit this restaurant. On arrival, I realised I have actually visited this restaurant several years ago but do not want to remember. We ordered 2 soups, a Tomato and a Asparagus soup, it was fine. A fried calamari, the squid is fresh but the coating keep dropping off. I then ordered Osso Buco as I like to take this as a test dish while my wife will usually order a Spaghetti Vongole. The Osso Buco turned out to be a little sour in taste(north and south Italy usually cooked this dish differently)and the meat failed badly. It was hard and dry and I have to chew so hard that I get a lot of meat stuck in between teeth. It failed my test badly. To me it is a marking scale of 3/10. The Vongole taste find, the portion of clams was generous but as usual in Singapore the clams is small and "skinny" as compare to those imported clams used in most good restaurants in Bangkok. Service is disappointing, the waiter took away a wine glass by mistake while we were talking. When we realised it we told the waiter that we have not finish the wine and he said no problem and he went to the kitchen and took back a glass with some left over wine in it. A good restaurant would have offered a new glass even though we do not expect them to return a full or even half glass of wine. Overall, it is not a bad restaurant and the food is reasonable if one is not expecting too much
5
The pasta was delicious. I ordered the carbonara, the taste and creaminess just right. My girlfrriend ordered the seafood pasta and it was delicious too, the seafood was fresh, Really recommended if you want to taste a great home style Italian food in Singapore :)
4
Service staff are able to give good recommendations. Do expect a little for food to be served though.
4
A nice place for date night, and their homemade pastas were fabulous. We also had the tiramisu which was both light and rich at the same time
4
We arrived early for our dinner but had to wait for a Friend. Restaurant staff kept pushing us for orders when it is still relatively empty.
5 stars for food thou
3
Pasta Brava is an Italian restaurant located in Chinatown. Ambiance is warm and pleasant and you are greeted with a wall of past awards when you enter. The service was attentive and fairly quick but not rushed. We had mushroom soup, lasagna, and lamb chops with veggies. The food overall tended to be bland. Hope this helps.
5
I was actually there to drop my wife, who was there to join her girlfriends for lunch. The aroma coming from inside the restaurant was so alluring that I cannot resist going in. I told myself that I will only say "Hello" to her girlfriends & maybe take a peek at the menu, maybe check out the appetizers.The loaf came follow by the calamari then the individual plates of pasta. OMG..when I came to my senses, I had eaten half a loaf & half a plate of calamari. I had few spoonful of five different dishes of pasta. I had nothing to say about the food except praises. This has to be the best Italian restaurant in Singapore. Another bonus is the pretty proprietor who manage the place. She is entertaining with her patrons & passionate with her servings.
5
A lovely lil Italian restaurant set in a old shop house conversion. The limonatas quenched our thirst and offered respite from the hot sun and the pastas are to die for.Strongly recommend that you book in advance as it can get busy around noon or just afte
1
Was there for my sister's hen's night celebration but the staff were incredibly rude and curt. I asked for a table in the corner so as to have some privacy as well as to avoid disturbing the others, but they gave us a table right in the middle.Food was good, but the service staff seriously needs more training
5
Went over with a Friend. Great ambiance, delicious food and exceptionally good service. The deserts tiramisu and panacota are a must try, trust me you won't regret it. We were served by this staff called Julie, who was great and was really friendly making the experience even better. Would definitely head back. Price is quite a norm for such restaurants around the area.
5
Finally had the chance to eat the highly raved Italian cuisine. Was really pleased with the friendly and attentive service crew, with special mention of Davin! Loved the crab meat linguine, minced lamb pasta, chocolate lava cake and tiramisu (from the "Secret Admirer") . Will definitely recommend this place with great food, service and ambience for friends and couples! Thank you Pasta Brava for the delightful dining experience!
5
It is my nth trip to Pasta Brava and it has never disappoint me..great service, delicious food, wonderful ambience..what more can I ask for? Keep it up!
5
Went on a Tuesday night and I was surprise that the restaurant was packed. Waited a while for the food but it's worth it. The vongole and squid ink pasta were excellent!
2
After reading all the reviews we were really excited to try this restaurant. Decor is great, service is good but the taste was very bland. All the dishes lacked seasoning and flavor.
5
Pasta Brava is my all-time favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore, having now frequented the establishment for close to 25 years. If you want quality ingredients and freshness, this is a must-go place for any Italian food lover.
3
Nice food but small portions-- so mediocre value and un-italian. Service very average too. A good but not great experience overall
5
Yums!! The staff are really on hand and friendly, willing to assist in any way. The ambience is cozy and relaxed.
5
Last visit was probably 7 years ago, and it was nice to see that not many changes were implemented...food was good, service attentive, and ambiance just as cozy. Some places can't leave well enough alone, so this was a pleasant surprise.
5
Four of us went here for dinner after searching TA for Italian places near Oasia Hotel. We were so glad to find this place so close to our hotel. We enjoyed a great meal here, outstanding quality and portions. We had pastas, salads and veal parm, all great choices. Service was great here. We didn't have to wait for a table, place did get full right after though. Well worth the trip here, great values for items ordered, will be back if and when we return here....
5
We were a party of 4 celebrating a joint birthday - had the best evening! The restaurant was full and the ambience was amazing. Attentive friendly staff. The chef made recommendations of freshly made pasta dishes and he was spot on, cooked to perfection. I had the rib eye which was juicy and succulent. My wife had food allergies and the chef was more than happy to accommodate her needs. The grilled prawns she had were super fresh. Despite being full, we could not resist the dessert menu. The molten chocolate lava with ice cream is to die for. What an amazing experience and we will be back. P and 
5
What can I say? It is an amazing place and u got to experience it yourself to believe it! The service, the food quality and the taste and the ambience was so good that I felt as if I was in Italy again! Went with 3 other friends and no one had anything unpleasant to say! I'm going back there again in 2 weeks
4
Good food. Steak and seafood great. cosy ambience, nice place for dates and small group (max 6). Attentive service but could be friendlier.
5
The staffs are very polite. Very attentive and helpful. The food tasted really good. They even complimentary us a birthday cake for my friend.
3
Service: Staff were attentive but kinda snobbish in my opinion.
Food: above average and reasonably priced.
Ambience: perfectly romantic with canvas for doodles.
4
Service was prompt and food was nice. Good for dinner dates. Pasta and grilled seafood was better than the risotto.
5
great experience and good food with the people I recommended, will be going back to again with my family
4
Pasta Brava is a Singapore institution. Family run in an old shop house, the quality of service and food remains high. A comprehensive menu caters for all tastes. Portion size size is generous. Atmosphere is great - it's never empty. Wine list good though I feel a bit pricey
4
Went for a post Christmas lunch gathering. Ambience at this restaurant is really cozy, nice place for romantic lunch/dinner too.Service - Slightly slow as the restaurant was almost full, took a while but it wasn't that bad. Staff were friendly and gave good recommendations.Food - We ordered quite a handful of food off the menu. For appetizers, we ordered Capesante Alla Cardinale Gratinale (Scallops), this dish deserves two thumbs-up! It's really delicious. The white wine, bechamel tomato sauce acts as a good dipping sauce with the white bread. Caesar Salad was good too.We ordered a few pasta dishes for sharing as well. Personally, I will order these two dishes again for my next visit. Pappardelle Al Ragu D'Anatra (Pappardelle with ragout of duckling and mushroom) and Spaghetti Anacapri (Spaghetti with crayfish, garlic, herbs and tomato sauce).As for desserts, highly recommending all 3 that we have ordered: Tiramisu, Chocolate Lava Cake and Italian Apple Cak

I would be fair and say it honestly, the main dish we ordered are good. The bruschetta, not so much. I would really like to put a positive feedback to this place, but the service really appalls me. As soon as you were sitted, wait 2 minutes and a waiter will arrived asking if you want to order. Of course you will be polite and tell them to give you some few more minutes. maybe 3 minutes after, the waiter will come again and ask. as this is a new place for me and my friend, we are really scrutinizing the menu to see which food do we like. it really irritates me when they keep on coming to us just to ask if we are ready to order as if we are being hurried to do so. the restaurant will also remove your plate as soon as you lay down your spoon and fork even with some foods left in your plate. while we are still finishing our bottle of wine, the waiter came to us to ask if we would like some dessert. we said no and the waiter left. not so long after, the waiter came to our table to pass to us our BILL! imagine that! we still have our bottle of wine yet we are already being billed! i dont know where does this place get their standard of service thinking its ok to bill a table without the guest asking for it. that is weird, seriously rude! right before we left, i asked the hostess if there is a time limit for each table, she said none

Very good restaurant. The taste of food is really Italian! A good place to go for me when I feel in the mood of having my country's food. The scallops are excellent but lobster linguine are too. The place is cozy and nice. Go and taste

We had been recommended this restaurant by locals and it was definitely our best meal experience of the week. First of all when you go take time to walk around the Tanjong Pagar neighbourhood, very interesting. The pasta was excellent, and the tiramasu dessert to finish was outstanding. Restaurant decor is really appealing, nice layout for quiet tables for two also. The stand out highlight was the staff service. We had a team of at least 4 people serve us through the evening , all friendly and super professional. They offered to hold back courses when appropriate and split one course we were sharing without hesitation. Everyone knew what the other team member was doing, we left very happy with the food and having enjoyed a great atmosphere all night. Highly recommended

It's my third visit and I love their pasta and ravioli, their risotto was just so-so. Desserts were awesome! I had the chocolate lava cake, tiramisu and the new crispy something
5
Food was fantastic and ambience was nice and cosy. Service was top notch. Will definitely be back again to try the other items on the menu.
5
this restaurant is one of the oldest survivors of the real Italian eateries that came and went over the years.
Now over 20 years here it shows that we still like the 1st class food prepared here.
By far the best in Singapore
5
Pasta brava is my favourite Italian restaurant. The service and the food was great as usual. Reservation made on CHOPE was also fuss free.
5
This has to be my favourite, tastiest Italian restaurant! The pastas are fresh, portions are good, ambience is amazing, and service is great! My favourite fish would be the wrapped crayfish pasta ~ can't wait to get back for more :)
5
This is one of my friend's favorite restaurants. We've been here before and come here when we want to celebrate something special. It's a very cozy restaurant--very popular (it can get loud), but perfect for a romantic dinner, too. The service is very friendly and the food is amazing. The meals are hearty enough to be comfort food, but the visual display is very appealing. Veggies were fresh, pasta was tasty and filling, fish (I don't eat meat) was delicious. Highly recommend
5
Excellent place for a good meal with friends and family. Ambience is nice. I ordered the scallop for anti pasti and it was fabulous. For main course, I had the Carbonara, which was really fragrant and filling. If you like it creamy (like I do), just ask the crew to ensure there is more sauce
3
This was the first time I dined here. I was craving for risotto and I decided to pick this place after reading all the good reviews. The service was great. Staff were polite and quick to respond. Although the squid ink risotto smells and taste good, it was a little disappointing. it doesnt leave a distinct taste and not savouring enough in my opinion. It doesnt have a burnt flavour like a lot of other good risottos and too watery. There is a good serve of seafood but disappointed that the prawns used were frozen prawns that were treated by soda bicarbonate which makes the prawns crunchy but loses the prawn flavour. It would be better if fresh prawns were used. There were clams and mussels but unfortunately the clams were not cleaned properly. I chewed on sand bits in my dish twice which i wasnt impress at all. Suggest to soak the clams long enough to allow the live clams to spit the sand/dirt out. Risotto at FOC restaurant in HongKong Street tastes better. Ok to visit if you are not as picky as me
5
My cousin and I enjoyed a very tasty dinner, with fine wine and excellent service. We had a quiet table, as requested, and the overall ambience was most conducive to good conversation and savouring the flavours of the food. We also enjoyed playing with chalk and paper after dinner
4
had dinner here my last night in Singapore after an extended summer stay. i remember ordering a soup but no other memory of it. It must be very boring. But the squid ink pasta was delicious. The pasta cooked just al dente and squid ink flavor really came through. The portion was reasonable but wish there were more because it was so yummy. If i come back, would order it again
5
Excellent food and service. Owner serenaded a birthday song to the birthday girl! Well done. Definitely be back!
5
Having been many many times the level of consistency, quality and service never fails to deliver an excellant experience coupled with great food.
4
Homely feel. we spent S$78 average per person. A bit expensive. authentic taste. Recommended if u have the budget.
4
I came away being impressed with the food. We had fried calamari as starters and I had the spicy tomato seafood stew which was really good!
The complimentary bread was baked fresh. One suggestion would be to introduce a variety of complimentary breads.
4
Felt like i stepped into an Italian eatery. Loads of chatter amid a cosy restaurant. Ordered king prawns and was truly satisfied at the just right juicyness of the prawns and the savoury sauce soaked yet crispy toasts. Very good balance found in the dish.Tiramisu was good, not impressive but good old tiramisu kind of good
4
Experience:Despite the bad reviews on service earlier, much has been done to rectify this.Food was very yummy, though prices are on the high side.Warm bread was served after we ordered, to stave off hunger as the food was made upon order. We had an antipasti and two mains.Food:Funghi Trifolati Alla RomanaIt was agreed that the money spent on this dish could have been better used on another main dish. Though it is still a good dish, it tasted a little like the mushrooms you can get from an economical rice stall. Ravioli Verdi Ripieni Con Ricotta E Pomodori SecchiDespite not having any meat in this, it was still satisfying, with an incredibly delicious sauce.Gnocchi di Patate Al Burro E SalviaThe highlight of the meal. These potato dumplings are incredibly soft with just the right amount of chewiness; biting into them is like sinking into pillows, small pillows for your teeth. Though the sauce is mainly made of cheese and butter, it was not very cheesy (unless you drink the sauce directly).Do be prepared to burn a hole in your pocket though
5
Went there with a bunch of friends recently and it was one of a kind dining experience for all of us. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant till our exit, we felt warmly welcomed. Staff were really attentive and never failed to impress us throughout the entire dining experience. Special mention to Virgilio A.K.A David and Katherine for their impeccable hospitality. Would definitely be our go-to restaurant for a great catch up with friends or a romantic candle light dinner with the significant other. - Ruth, Mary, Moses, Eugene, Kelly (shy girl
5
Wanted to try the home made pasta so we ordered the stracci and mezzelune! Given a bread basket as well. Food is very good! Stracci comes with fresh scallops and prawns! Al dente pasta and delicious sauce! The mezzelune is equally outstanding! The sauce is amazing Lovely cosy atmosphere with candles~ highly recommend for dates here
4
Located in the outskirt of the CBD thus quite accessible. The service by the staff is rather commendable, and so is the quality of the food. One important thing to note is the utensils - it seems like they are not cleaned thoroughly and you can see stains on the plates and glasses. Overall a good experience
5
We had the crabmeat linguine and stracci with saffron cream sauce. Both pasta aced it for us. The crabmeat linguine offered a generous portion of shredded creamy rich crabmeat while the stracci with homemade pasta was thin and flavourful with generous serving of scallops and prawns. Will definitely be back to try out other dishes! Price was definitely good value for money
5
It was a very good dinner place. Homey feel & good service.
My family enjoyed every dish we ordered. S$60 average per person.
Taste very authentic.
Highly recommended!
3
Service was not very friendly probably due to peak dinner hour, I had it twice the first experience was good and pasta serving was just nice. The second time the portion became smaller and pasta is a little hard but not al dente kind.
5
The food is delicious.
And as an Italian I do value the real taste of my Country.
The location and the atmosphere is fantastic.
4
Hi, i had visit pasta brava this tuesday on 27/9, the atmosphere is very good, and the staffs are also friendly.
5
Food, ambiance and service are very well presented. A good selection of food and wines. Had a squid ink pasta for main and tiramisu for dessert. One of the best few Italian meals I had locally. Two thumbs up! 👍😊👍
4
Ordered the seafood linguini in aglio olio style with a request for extra-strong garlic. While I didn't get bowled over by garlic during the meal, the garlic taste lingered pleasantly, reminiscent of a good meal that had been put together in a balanced way. It was always easy to get the attention of the service staff, perhaps a little too easy even as the slightest eye contact necessitated me to clarify I didn't need service. When we eventually decided that we needed help to dilute the garlic aftertaste, the service staff saw that we were in a rush and whisked out a single scoop of emergency sorbet that was not charged in the bill - definitely an extra-mile service. By the way, the tables are covered with large squares of white paper for diners to doodle on, crayons provided. You can see selected ones adorning the restaurant's walls! Because of the price, it's not an everyday dinner place but is a good idea for an occasional Italian fix
5
It was my first visit and I can say clearly to you. This place is the most wonderful place to enjoy the Italian cuisine. The staff's service was great. Especially the boss was a very kind and gentle and witty person. and the chef Ilham is the best chef ever. His pasta was absolutely amazing. I can't explain the taste of Squid ink pasta. There's no fake I wish i could taste his pasta once more. You should be try all that food here. I promise that you'll never disappointed
2
Had dinner there lat night. Food was disappointing. The squid black ink pasta was dry, and hard, while my pasta with scallops and prawn were soft and mushy. The prawns and scallops were fresh.Service was poor, and we had difficult time trying to catch someone's eye (there were quite a no of helper looking busy..), for water, and to take our order.No friendly smile or word :
4
My friend was raving about this resto during my last visit to Singapore but not able to fit into my schedule. So during my recent trip, this was on the MUST visit list. However I was truly disappointed as it was not up to the hype. We ordered the scallops, ravioli and gnocchi. The scallops were delicious but the same sentiment cant be say for the pasta dishes. The gnocchi tasted flat and not pillowly soft while the ravioli was a tad under cook. However, we did enjoy the Moscato & the ambiance of the restaurant was good. Service was overall good except that we had to remind the waiter several time for the wine lis
5
It was my first visit and I'm impressed with their squid ink pasta. It has a lot of squid ink taste and did not taste fake. It was crowded on a Friday Night but an enjoyable dinner nonetheless. Service was quick and good. Made a mistake with my order and they still allowed me to change it. They also took note of my comment on Chope that it was my mum's birthday and went to add a candle on the tiramisu she ordered and even gave it to us on the house!It was a kind gesture and for an establishment that is well-known, it had all the heart you needed
5
Had a great night with my gf at the restaurant. Staff was attentive and food was served promptly. The portobello was awesome and the pasta great. Atmosphere was definitely a plus and will definitely come back again.
4
Celebrated birthday , nice ambience . Casual dining. Paper on table for u to doodle . Food was quite good. Worth a visit!
5
Pasta Brava serves very good Italian good - Pasta, meat or sea food - with great value. Patronised for 20 years and the quality has been consistent. Must try for those who want to eat regular Italian food
5
The food and service was as good as it used to be. We were seated quickly and the staff helped to prepare the birthday dessert n took pictures for us.
3
Booked on the basis of Trip Advisor rating and reviews . Although the restaurant was busy in an otherwise deserted part of town on a Saturday lunchtime the food was a bit of a let down . Starters were OK although the beetroot , spinach and pine nut salad was good . However the main courses were a bit of a let down , and , in particular , the home made pasta - the Lasagne was a little dry and the pumpkin pasta uninspiring .
5
Was recommended by a friend and was surprised by their home made pasta. Being a veggie it is quite difficult to find great options in famous places. But Pasta Brava didint disappoint me. Their wine, ambiance & food are out of the world. Strongly recommend it & would be an ideal place for a date
5
Delicious Italian food with a great service is a combination that never goes wrong !!! Went for a lunch with friends and we all had a great time eating great food in the company of good friends. Will sure go back for more and strongly recommend.
4
A group of friends celebrated my birthday here. The restaurant was full even though it was a Monday night. Staff were friendly and attentive. What made the experience memorable was the owner, Mr Rolando Lucieri who regaled us with his stories and told us that he was the one who introduced tiramisu to Singapore. He also gave us a complimentary tiramisu cake (not slice) to celebrate my birthday. Each of us had more than one slice of the delicious cake. To top it all, Mr Lucieri personally sang the birthday song. This restaurant has a long history and has seen generations of the same family dining at its premises. It has no plans to expand because it is focused on delivering quality and a positive experience for its customers and staff. How rare
4
Overall was a pleasant experience. Was my first time there. Had their homemade pasta which was nicely done and the beef too. Requested during reservation for quiet corner seats as we are celebrating our anniversary. The staff were friendly and helpful. They surprised us with a Tiramisu after our main course, with a " Happy Anniversary" and a candle on it. Was a nice touch I thought.But to our surprise later, I realized I was being charged for the tiramisu. Hmm Other then that I enjoyed the dinner and the overall ambience although the tables felt a bit too closed to each other
5
We love going to Pasta Brava, it never disappoints from the food to the service, to the ambience (never empty even on a weekday). We've been here at least 5 or 6 times in the last year and I don't remember not liking any of the dishes we tried so far. Tip: ask to be seated on the ground floor if you can as we were on the second floor once and it was naturally harder to get attended to and the ambience is not as good as the main area downstairs.
4
For the price of 22-24$ a plate, I'd like a little more pasta to fill me up, but overall it was perfectly cooked. Would return again and great atmosphere.
4
Overall the experience is pleasant and the staff is courteous. The steak is cooked well at our request for medium done.
Good value for money
3
Food was good but portion was very little! the fresh pasta dishes especially! service was great as the staff recommended what to eat but it took a while for the bill to come.
5
Great authentic home-style Italian. Excellent service. Ideal for first dates as the ambiance is quiet and romantic.
4
This is a reasonably priced very authentic Italian restaurant. The calamari was particularly tasty as was the steak, vongole pasta and chocolate lava cake. They have a great wine list and the service staff are very professional and friendly.
5
We have been going to this restaurant since 1990 and have never been disappointed. It's Italain owner is very personable and always on duty, but he runs a tight ship. All the staff are very well trained, know all the menu items and their ingredients. They are attentive without being fussy. The atmosphere is casual with a real buzz every night. Everything is great and fresh. I'd always recommend the calimari,spaghetti with crayfish in a spicy tomato sauce served in a paper bag or 'cartoccio'. Children love it too and crayons are provided for doodling on the paper tablecloths. Great restaurant for couples and families. Can't recommend it highly enough as the genuine article in Singapor
5
We come here once or twice a year usually for birthdays. We have never been disappointed with either the food or service. The portions are sensible sizes to allow 3 courses. Our most recent visit was enjoyable as the maitre d' moved us away from a noisy table to a quieter location and one of our meals not being cooked to our liking was replaced without fuss. Recommended for special occasion meals
3
First of all this is a romantic place. Comments about the service I read at TripAdvisor but as far as we are concerned service was good on our visit at the restaurant. Now the food. We started with bruchetta. Personally I found it a little bland. Looking for salt to make it more tasty. At the same time they bring the soup. Soup is ok but not like a wow, something special. Then I get the beef with peppercorn and gorgonzola sauce. And that was great. With some veggies and mashed potatoes. That kind of made my dinner a highlight. My girlfriend opted for salmon which was also very good. Both were not a big dish, so as it supposed to be, eat appetisers or share pasta before the main dish. We chose a simple vanilla ice cream desert. Which was indeed simple. Just a scoop of good ice cream. No creative ideas to make it look better. I closed with a Irish coffee. What is was missing is the whiskey in the Irish coffee. I felt no hint of alcohol in my coffee. So overall I have good feelings but it was mainly because of the main dish which was great. We did not eat the pasta. Maybe next time. With wine expect to spend 100sgd a person
4
Lotsa variety of pasta, yummy! Love the Squid ink risotto! Nice prosciutto! The chocolate lava cake is great! Even for a non-dessert lover like me. Too bad the bread for appetizer (free) is no longer freshly baked as what I tried 3-4 years ago.. What a shame..
3
Came here during the week to try the set lunch with some friends. We turned up without a reservation and were able to get a seat (the restaurant seemed pretty busy so a reservation might be advisable). The set lunch is $30++ and consists of 3 courses and tea or coffee, but the choices for each course are quite limited. Food quality was fine and the service was efficient
4
Cozy environment with great waiter. Had a birthday celebration there and the waiter prepared the cake in advance and helped with the celebration! Free cake too 👍🏻 ambience and food were 👍🏻 too!
5
The service staff were warm and attentive. The food was delicious and served in suitably sized portions.
5
Two of us for dinner, excellent place, service was friendly meals were great, good variety to choose from, price was reasonable for Singapore, recommend
4
Pasta was al dente, ambience was lovely, everything was good. Highly recommended. Will definitely go back!
2
Went for lunch : lovely decor and homely atmosphere. Loved the menu cards and the wide choice of pastas and food on the menu. Unfortunately, service was poor : food took a while to be served, servers attention seemed to be elsewhere. When we asked for the breads that are served while one waits, the server said the bread would be served with the food! Anyway, the food when it came was patchy : some pastas were mouthwateringly delicious and others were average. As an aside, the bread was rock hard and chewy-good thing it wasn't served earlier!! Was disappointed with the overall experience: I can only imagine we are in a minority given the awards the restaurant has won
3
We were looking for a decent Italian comfort meal after weeks touring SE Asia. We searched some sights and Pasta Brava kept popping up as a good choice. We couldn't get a reservation the first night we wanted to go, but we got in the following night. Great ambiance and was somewhat full when we arrived. Wine is pricey especially for the caliber being offered. We ended up with a SGD 70 house red that wasn't anything special. We got a meat antipaste to start that was good quality, but small like so small for SGD 20. We also shared a eggplant parm that lacked flavor. Entrees were much better! The highlights were a homemade pasta with seafood in a saffron cream sauce and the lamb cannelloni. Desserts were also good and we enjoyed a well prepared tiramisu and a decadent chocolate lava cake. We would definitely go back as there were clear highlights, but also sticker shock and some clear unjustified pricing.
4
Selected this restaurant for birthday celebration for my boyfriend. The ambience is great. I love that they had free flow bread basket, just like in italy! We ordered one appetizer, two mains and two glasses of wine. The beef was great, the ravioli was decent. They served a complimentary tiramisu for my boyfriend and it was really authentic.
5
After living here for four years, I have finally found a restaurant which has great service and great food - not an easy feat here ! Service was probably the best I've received - with the waiters happily changing our starter order, the chefs plating up our shared meals for us, and then the staff providing a complimentary tiramisu for my husbands birthday. If you like a laid back atmosphere with good food and service , this is the place for you 
5
decor is beautiful, feels homely and excellent choice of furnitures to give the rustic feel. Service by a Malay gentleman at 2nd level was so pleasant and he helpfully gave recommendation and was so attentive to all the tables he served. As for food, the fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese with tomato n basil and veal which was deep fried ( mentioned was a traditional Italian way) were tad of under my expectation. However, baked scallops with bechamel sauce was such a beautiful and tasty dish with the freshness of scallop. Excellent dining experience for a date!
4
This is a excellent old established restaurant. 20years and the owners are just as enthusiastic and passionate about their food & it is really,really good. It's real italianunentangled food in style ,taste and size. and the service is super nice.The people at this restaurant have been there for years and a happy lot. I had ravioli and tiramusa ,and it was very good. I was hosted and i will go back anytime when I need to host the next time.I can't wait for the next meal at Pasta Brava
5
The food is amazing, the service is good too. Do book way in advance as the restaurant is really popular!
5
Good food, nice place with reasonable prices. One of my favourite Italian place in Singapore. Highly recommended
5
Came here to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. Didnt mention any special request but the waitress put a Happy Birthday sign on the dessert without asking. Really impressed with the service.
4
Great food at affordable pricing.
Amiable staffs who constantly check on you if everything was fine.
4
Want a restaurant with nice vibes and good italian food but at decent prices? Pasta Brava checks all those boxes.
4
This is a more reasonably priced Italian restaurant, though still a tad pricey. But at least they serve reasonable portions compared to other Italian eateries I've been to around town! And their warm, crusty Italian bread is amazing.
5
reached there before my reservation time. it was not crowded and the waiter and waitress was very attentive to our request. the pasta was nice especially their squid ink pasta! very thoughtful of one staff. I actually request if it is possible to write happy birthday on the plate of the tiramisu cake that we have ordered. but he say that request are only for preordered. so I was like nvm it ok. but after that he made the extra mile to put a happy birthday stick on the cake and candle to surprise my boyfriend. which surprises me as well. this make our experience at this resturant a good one. will definetly come back again.
4
I had the pappardelle with duck and mushroom. The home-made pasta was very fresh and the taste was great. I went on a friday night and it was packed. Reservation is highly recommended to avoid disappointment although I would prefer a place with fewer people and tables placed further apart. The Tartufo I had for dessert had the right sweetness and creaminess
5
Dinner at Pasta Brava made my trip. It was a recommendation from a local friend and it did not disappoint. We had the scallops in a vodka sauce, gambas with garlic, fettuccine carbonara, tenderloin with black pepper sauce and tiramisu. All beautifully done. Cost with a glass of wine and a drink was sgd 130 approx. Our waitress was brilliant. Always checking on us, topping up our water. Restaurant had a homely feel but with nice high ceilings. Felt spacious and not at all noisy. Would definitely come back when we are next in Singapore. Thank you for a wonderful meal.
4
My partner and I checked out this restaurant for dinner on an evening. We were seated at a table beside the bar and the cashier so there was not much privacy and there were many movements and conversations from the waiters and waitresses. Service was okay, nothing exceptional and can be further improved.We waited for a while and the waitress served our starters with warm bread. For starters, we ordered the caprese, which was good and the minestrone soup, which was just okay. For the mains, we ordered the tagliata and the lasagne. The tagliata meat was very tender and fresh. The lasagne tasted good; the tomato sauce was well made and the portion was just right. For desserts, we ordered the tiramisu to share and it was one of the better tiramisu we had tried in Singapore
3
The food is nice, not fantastic though. Price was reasonable. Service not up to those standard Italian restaurant but was Ok. Embience not bad.
4
Service was good, my family enjoyed our dinner, quality pasta was served. good birthday celebration for my partner!
3
Had dinner with 3 other girlfriends.Ambience- nice and cosyService- I felt the service was an ok- can feel the female staff were merely providing service that they had to but didn't have the feeling of "love to serve" that comes from their heart- when giving feedback, the best time to test someone's response to it and how their service attitude comes to displayFood- we had 4 appetisers and 4 mains - paid sgd 15 for a plate of salad which I really wish I had taken a photo. Little greens (baby spinach) and 4 pieces of med size beet roots with bits of pine nuts. Honestly, it was a rip off! - I love sea urchin and have tried many fresh ones. Hence, ordered pasta with crab meat and sea urchin. I was totally disappointed with the results. The pungent smell/ taste not sure comes from which ingredient but definitely smelt and tasted horrible. If I may describe it as bad smell coming from not fresh seafood. The owner was nice and he cooked another plate for us but sorry, it was the same. Finally found out that the sea urchin was frozen. Maybe the reason. - ordered spaghetti with lobster and that dish was nothing to shout about. The spaghetti was nicely cooked but the meat from the lobster tasted powdery. We didn't enjoy our meal and had much left overs. For the price we paid, about S$ 250 (without costing in the wine), we are certainly looking elsewhere for better quality food which am sure we can find!Will I return? Never.
4
Our table was in upstairs. It was calm and quiet atmosphere. We didn't order so much. Just squid ink pasta and mushroom risotto. Both were vary nice and we'd like to try than again.Their service was also good. Not too much and also not too less
2
We dined at the restaurant for two nights in a row, and even though the food was nice, the service was really bad on both occasions. I find it unacceptable to be getting up from my chair 4 times, to request either menu, wine or someone extra food. On the first evening we went quite late, and we perfectly knew that the restaurant was closing soon. We hurried up and ordered everything, but it wasn't necessary to order the dessert before even having our main course. The second day we decided to seat outside and they completely forgot that we were in the restaurant .I had to get up from my chair 4 times to have the menu, order the food and even for the dessert. They didn't even say good bye after I paid. I will never come back to that restaurant
5
We were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary and decided to try this restaurant. The food was really nice, especially the pastas. Ambience was great, very comfortable and cosy. We like the kid friendly atmosphere with the colour chalk and paper to keep them entertained. The service was great, and we were pleasantly surprised they gave us a complimentary tiramisu for our anniversary!! Thanks for a lovely experience
5
I made a reservation at 7pm, and arrived slightly early. The waiter got my reservation, and showed me to my table. As I need to go urgently to the washroom, I told the waiter to show my friend (who just came in) our table, and left. When i came back, the waiter had tied a cushion to the back of my chair (I was visibly pregnant), held the seat for me, and arranged for a table bag hanger to hang my bag. The extra gestures has not gone unnoticed.For appetizers, we ordered the baked scallop and duck liver. It was excellent. The pasta and squid ink spagaddies was average though. But the lava cake was excellent.  Waiter was attentive throughout and made effort to refill our glass with warm water throughout. Overall, we had a great time there, and will definitely come again
3
The downstairs restaurant has a great reputation for their pastas - and passing through, it appeared to be comfortable and lively. But we had a group of 40+ upstairs and it was uncomfortably hot, and the staff seemed to be overwhelmed. Some of our table had to wait to be served a lot longer than the rest of us a few times, so this was not a single instance. The servers were quite nice & I think understaffed. I had a steak which was prepared with a chocolate sauce- the steak was perfect & the sauce was delicious!In summary, this is a place that I'd try again for pasta with a small party, but would avoid booking the 2nd floor venue with a large group.
4
We had the scallops with brown butter, venison carpaccio, squid ink pasta and a steak. Everything was great. Except tt they served cold bread with no butter or olive oil with vinegar. Had one of e best squid ink pastas here. Slightly salty but very good Umami. Will come back again
4
Went to Pasta Brava with a group of colleagues and thoroughly enjoyed my dinner. Started with a beautiful calamari entree which was tender. Had fillet for main with a chocolate and red wine sauce. I was at first hesitant due to the chocolate, however it worked. Would I choose it again, maybe not, however, nothing ventured.... Finished with very tasty Tiramisu. This is the second time I've been to Pasta Brava and both times I have not been disappointed
5
nice food and atmosphere!
I spent wonderful time with my friend.
I strongly recommend this restaurant!!
4
It was our first time there and the experience was well worth it. The wine selection was good and the service was way above standard in Singapore. The food was reasonably priced as well. Wil definitely be going back there again.
4
Delicious Italian offerings in the middle of the Chinatown. This restaurant is quite busy during lunch. May be because it serves a great value set lunch. The ala carte items were just as pleasing. A wonderful place for Italian meals if you are nearby.
5
We came here for our Vday dinner and it was PERFECT. the food is brilliant and the service staff were all extremely nice. 10/10 will recommend. Keep up the good work!
5
Service was prompt and excellent. Food was awesome, I had the stracci in saffron cream which send me to heaven !
5
The restaurant had a very relaxing ambience, and staff were friendly, attentive, and helpful. While waiting times for the food were slightly longer, there was a cup of chalk by the side for you to doodle on your table. Don't be fooled by the food serving. It looked small, but after the meal and strolling for a bit, I began to feel very full. Price was alright too, overall a great meal. Will definitely visit again to try their other Pasta

Now this may not be the best Italian Restaurant in town, but I look a bit further than just quality. This was on a Tuesday evening and many restaurants in the Keong Saik/Craig Road area were half full. Not Pasta Brava. Just really full. The good thing was that the Italian owner/manager said that it was no problem. Upstairs there is room. Initially affraid to be seated in an almost upper floor, but it was a good surprise that even the 2nd floor was quite full. Nice ambiance and very pleasant service and food really good when you look at the price/quality relation. And they had an extremely good Pio Cesare housepour.Therefore I rate this restaurant as perfect when taking all elements in regard

Pasta Brava has cosy interiors. The service staff are polite, informed and provide good service. We ordered bruschetta $6 and portobello mushrooms $17 to share. The scallop and prawn pasta $23.5 was delicious. So were their pumpkin pasta and canneloni with minced lamb. Their panna cotta with amaretto $10 was perfect and the best I have ever tasted. They use really ingredients in their cooking. It is a lovely place to dine if you don't mind the small portions
5
It doesn't get better than having great service, great ambiance, authentic food, and homemade pasta. A restaurant that gives me a little "touch of Italy". If you are looking for a good place to wind down on weekend, Pasta Brava comes highly recommended note reservations are necessary. The prices are similar to other Italian eateries along the Bukit Timah/Holland/Orchard belt but the quality of the food is probably one of my favourites in Singapore with very reasonable pricing. The Spaghetti Della Pescatrice, Spaghetti with seafood in squid ink sauce, is probably one of their most well-known items on the menu and definitely a crowd favourite. The Risotto Al Funghi Porcini, Arborio rice cooked with porcini mushrooms, white wine & parmesan cheese, is another winner for me with its cheesy base and thick mushroom stock. All the food we ate was delicious; this place will be a regular for us. It was a treat!

First time to pasta brava, did not fall short of expectations. My date and I ordered the some salmon pasta, lasagna, and calamari. For someone who isn't a fan of oily food, I must say the calamari was addictive but wasn't queasy to the stomach! As for the mains.... I concur with everyone else. Prices were a little steep though.Service was pretty warm, and the boss Rolando himself came and greeted us, and lit the candle himself seeing we were there on a date. Pleasant experience overall
5
They are able to cater to your needs and the service was excellent. The price was reasonable as well.
5
The food was nice, service was great. Almost everythig was good. Love the food. Had a surprise bday cake from David too. David is a damn good waiter. He promotes the right food and matches he right food together
5
There's a reason Pasta Brava has been around for so long - They do everything very well. I couldn't fault any of it.
5
I visited here with my friend. They served each dish splitted for us two. Their speciality spaghetti with squid ink was outstanding. We definitely come again:)
5
Food is good and service is excellent. Waiting time a bit long as they overcooked and it's quite crowded. But definitely worth the wait

Celebrated a friend's birthday at Pasta Brava. It was my first time here but probably not a good one compared to other Italian establishments I have been in Singapore. For starters, we had the calamari, portobello mushrooms and jamon with melon. They were good but not like 'wow' . In fact, I have enjoyed the starters more than the main dishes that follow. We had the fresh pasta with saffron cream sauce which I felt it is a tad too creamy and overwhelming after a few mouthful. Have wanted to swop that for another sauce but the service staff advised otherwise and said ' up to you if you wish to change but it may end up tasting like a Chinese noodle dish' (which I thought he could have expressed that with a little more sensitivity). We also had the squid ink risotto, seafood aglio olio and duckling ragout pappardelle. Of all, the squid ink risotto seem the most worthy dish of all (though not perfect as the arborio rice is little too al dente for a risotto dish I feel though I do know it shouldn't be too cooked and mushy too). Overall, the prices are reasonable and it is still a decent place for Italian dishes. However, for special occasions and to delight my guests, there are other establishments you may consider. Worth a try at pasta Brava and feel free to share your review since the above is very much my personal opinions having been a Italian food lover
4
Went for an early lunch at the restaurant so no problems with waiting time at all and service staff were all very attentive.Excellent pasta choices, although I must say that I didn't enjoy my pasta as much as the chocolate lava cake! Will definitely revisit
5
The lady who served us was very friendly and warmly. She recommended the popular meal to us as it was the first time we visited this restaurant. We ordered seafood soup, spaghetti with squid ink, TB Angus Steak, and chocolate lava cake. All of them was very good. It's worth it
4
I am told by my hosts that it is one of the locals' favourite Italian restaurant. A great range of lovely traditional Italian and pasta. Pleased the pasta was al dente'. The wine range was limited but came nicely chilled. The service was charming and efficient. Not too sure of the squid ink pasta but the other dishes were terrific
5
I have been going to Pasta Brava for many years. I am so sick and tired of nouvelle cuisine type portions at some Italian Restaurants. Rolando offers good, wholesome Italian food, and may I say at a very reasonable price.The ambiance is excellent and as a regular,one gets greeted as an old friend by Rolando and his excellent,very well trained staff.My favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore,by far. Try the Panna Cotta for dessert.....to die for!Chris Jones,Singapor
4
Must have the grilled fish with saffron sauce. Good portion sizes that you can share . The chocolate lava dessert is to die for. Great wine options. Fun place for a dinner
5
Long heard of this place but was always lazy to travel over. Now i will def make the effort.
Had pasta, salad and dessert. All impressed. Relaxed homely atmosphere with good prices. Unpretentious.
Taste of food all well balanced.
4
Everyone enjoyed the dinner. Personal favorite was the mushroom risotto. The squid ink pasta was somewhat lacking in taste. All other dishes were good
5
Very authentic pasta. Best in Singapore by a fair way. Reasonable prices and impeccable service. Was so impressed I returned the next day. Would definitely recommend
5
Came to celebrate our anniversary here as this was the reataurant of our first date. And so.pleased to see that Pasta Brava is still here and still as good as always. Delighted to see Rolando still enthusiasrixally and professionally running this quaint old school Italian restaurant.The home made pasta is consistently excellent (and I'm talking more than 14 years consistent!
4
Celebrated our 21st Wedding Anniversary at PASTA BRAVA located in quaint Craig Road. Stepping into this restaurant is like going into a friend's cosy Italian home. While we wait for our food,bread basket was served as we drew with crayons on majong paper set on dining table. Every dish except the mushroom soup was hearty and yummy, very impressive! Service provided by WAN was amazing & friendly and efficient and he certainly made an awesome dining experience! It's no wonder this place continues to pack in the diners after so many years! Antipasto Della Casa, Lasagna, Bistecca Angus Ribeye, Cholocate Lava Cake are GREAT ! Reservation is a must ! We are already making plans to visit again at Christmas ❤
4
Which is divine. You need to book as this seems to be a very popular restaurant. The atmosphere is great and there was a buzz. The service was prompt and attentive without being over the top.I started with the calamari and the serving was large enough for two, but the cannelloni was superb.I love Italian food, but this was one of the best
3
We hadn't been to Pasta Brava in years and met up with another couple for dinner there on a Friday night. The restaurant has great atmosphere and is a good place for a couple or small group for an intimate evening where you can hear each other speak. However, the food is hit and miss and overall mediocre but given the moderate pricing, we were not completely put off. Be aware that the service is slow and depending on your waiter, may be a bit pretentious. We waited just over an hour for 4 pasta dishes. So if you go, make sure you are with good company whom you enjoy being with. We will be back because we like the atmosphere, but not that often.
4
Came with a bunch of friends for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. Food was delicious and top-notch. Tiramisu was okay, and service was pretty good except for having to remind the server about 3 times for my drink—forgivable as it was a full house. Happy to go back again when I have that hankering for some good old fashion Italian food done right
5
We did not have a booking for this restaurant and by luck, we were able to secure a table.It is a very busy place, so if we returned, we would book so we were not disappointed.The owner Rolando attended to us for the evening. What a delightful host! Explained the wines to us so we selected the right ones for our palate.Also asked about what we felt like eating recommending various dishes from the menu.I chose the seafood pasta and my partner the veal. The bread selection was delicious as well.This restaurant deserves all the awards it has received in the 23 years of operation.Now on our favourite places to eat in Dingapore.Gracia Rolando
5
Been coming here for so many years, and this visit reminded us of what we missed most - top notch, friendly service plus fantastic Italian food!
5
Went there for dinner to celebrate a birthday and it was amazing! Seamless service from the staff made the entire meal so special. Food was very well made and serving was huge. Coming back for sure!
5
Though I work around tanjong pagar, this was the first time I Explorer Craig road area and I am glad that I have found a great Italian pasta place. Tried the seafood squid ink pasta and I enjoyed it. Looking forward to trying other choices.
5
Great service and staff pay very close attention to details, less a lady who was rather rude and impatient.
Food is excellent too and serving is good. Their pastas are absolutely wonderful and the seafood is very fresh. Do try their chocolate lava cake too!
3
We visited this restaurant after reading the reviews and initially we were very happy to have chosen it. The staff are really welcoming and friendly and always look like they are doing something, not once did we see them having private conversations with their colleagues and were instead helping the other diners in the restaurant. The food was very tasty, however the portion sizes were small especially for the price you pay. We also had to wait a while for our food and noticed that other tables were given baskets of complimentary bread and we didn't. We're not sure if we had to ask but it was not made clear. All together, for two main meals, two double vodkas and cokes and two double brandy and cokes our bill came to S$215 a price we felt was way too much considering what we ordered
5
We werde actually intending on going somewhere else but then we spite Pasta Brava and spontaneously decided to go there. And it was definitely worth it. We have been traveling for 6 weeks now and therefore we were very delighted about the incredible pasta menu. It tasted delicious and the service was also very good
4
It was for a birthday celebration. At first I was like why do they need 2 seatings? It turned out it was a good arrangement as they will time the food so well and even have time for desserts... Authentic Italian food reasonable priced! Will come again..
1
I went to Pasta Brava to celebrate a friend's birthday upon hearing good reviews about this restaurant. However, I was terribly disappointed with the experience due to the absolutely distasteful service that we received from our waiter, Shia. We had requested for an additional bread basket for our table of 9, and the waiter was not only rude and sarcastic to us upon hearing our request, he did not serve us anything despite serving all the surrounding tables. He basically threw the bread basket in front of our friend only after clearing all our main courses, and by then we had already assumed we were not going to get served. It was just absolutely uncalled for and could have been prevented. It was an utter turn off, and because of that, we decided to head elsewhere for desserts to celebrate our friend's birthday. This entire incident was very disappointing and a pity, especially because we had genuinely enjoyed the main courses served to us. It was just a really terrible service experience with the staff, and I don't think I am ever going to patronise this restaurant again in the near future. I say this because so many other Italian restaurants in Singapore often have a homely and extremely friendly service experience, and having had this experience at one of the supposedly best Italian restaurants in Singapore, it was extremely distasteful
4
This has become one of our favorite Italian restaurants in SG. A "must" whenever we're here is the pumpkin puree stuffed ravioli with red capsicum sauce. I just love this pasta dish! This visit, we tried the lamb chops and beef tenderloin with gorgonzola sauce. Both were very good and the meat were cooked exactly to our preference. Service, as always, is warm and efficient.
4
Came here for dinner with my partner for her birthday. The staff were excellent, hospitable and very attentive to our needs. The food was also fresh and fantastic. We had the spinach ravioli and squid ink pasta. They were absolutely spectacular! Seafood was fresh and the pasta was done really well (al dente). Highly recommended.The only thing we felt could have been better were the portion sizes of the appetizers and soup. They were really little for their price. Had the grilled vegetables and double boiled vegetable soup. Nevertheless, they were tasty.As it was a special occasion, they provided us with their home made tiramisu cake after our meal which was really delicious too!Overall, a fantastic authentic Italian dining experience with a wonderful, intimate ambience to match. Highly recommended
5
I have visited this restaurant many times living nearby and have never been disappointed by the beautiful fresh food and flavours
4
This place has a wall of awards and may I say, well deserved. It's got a great fancy yet homely ambience. Great wait staff that pays attention to each table and takes the initiative to make sure you've got everything you need before you even know you need it. Excellent food!
4
Table for 6pax, We ordered starters to share tomato bruschetta, garlic butter mushrooms, prosciutto melons & deep fried calamariEach individual ordered main course, seafood platter, carbonara pasta, crab meat pasta, beef tenderloin & Lamb chops. The best flair dish was the lamb, it was tasty and done to perfection medium rare. I'm not a fan of pasta therefore find it mediocre. We ordered 2 desserts to share chocolate lava cakes & tiramisu. We totally enjoyed the dessert Service was good. My brother & myself wanted to share a pasta & beef tenderloin, they served and pre-plated both items into one plate us. Was pleasantly surprise with the server for organising this without being requested. We spend averagely $60 per person. Definitely will recommend this place should you have a craving for italian food
5
We have been to this restaurant for a few times and we enjoyed it very much each time we were there.The restaurant is inside an old shophouse and with nice romantic decor. It is always full at dinner time so reservation is recommended. Great Italian food and the owner is Italian. Service is very good
4
Came here on my first date and I must say, my boyfriend brought me to the right place. Dinner time can be full house, so reservation is best. Food was amazing, we especially liked the squid ink pasta. Can't remember what other dishes we got, but overall they are all nice
4
*Charmaine and I chanced upon Pasta Brava, located along the row of conservation shophouses at Tanjong Pagar area. The dimly romantic interior decor was both tasteful and intimate, yet there was no pretentiousness to it at all. There are Straits Chinese decorations and souveinirs around the restaurant, as well as paintings done by the owner's brother. The restaurant has two stories, and we were sitting on level 2, where we enjoyed the cozier end of the restaurant. The service crew was rather attentive towards the end of the meal.For mains, *Charmaine had the Linguine Regina del Mare (SGD$23.00) - linguine pasta with scallops, clams, prawns, squid, crayfish in garlic and tomato sauce. The linguine were springy and the gravy was a delicious mixture of sweet-sour flavour.I chose something under the "Pasta Fatta in Casa" (homemade pasta) section, the Agnolotti Farciti al Salmone (SGD$23.50) - round shaped pasta filled with fresh and smoked mashed salmon, served with tomato and cream sauce. The pasta had a great chewy texture, and the mashed salmon was smooth, creamy, almost velvety on the tongue. It was utterly tasty.For more detailed information and full review, please refer here:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/05/dinner-at-pasta-brava-craig-raod.htm

We had a wonderful dinner at S$70 per head for share appetiser and dessert. Corkage was $30 per bottle. Service was friendly, professhional and attentive. Food was well presented, at the right temperature and great taste. I would recommend their homemade Stracci Al Gamberi - thin piece of broad fresh pasta with seafood in white wine and saffron cream sauce, which is not too rich. It is creative, refreshing and delicious! The lamb chops was traditional with three large generous tender and thick cuts at reasonable price of $33++ and grilled to perfection, the fresh mint was a nice touch. Despite the tables were rather closed to each other, it has nice soft music, warm decoration and high ceiling. We had a relaxing and enjoyable Saturday night dinner. And parking at Craig Plaza was no hassle at all
5
We booked off a corner of the restaurant on the 2nd floor for a friend's birthday earlier this month, and were very happy with the service provided. Food was delicious - my personal favourites were the calamari, john dory and squid ink pasta, and I will definitely be back
2
Dinner for 2. Had expectations (online reviews and the many awards on the wall). Meal was quite dissapointing.Starters:Gamberi Con Aglio - not sure if the shrimp was freshCapesante Alla Cardinale Gratinate - it said they'd be sauteed with white wine, bechamel sauce and ovenglazed. The scallops were practically swimming in a thick sauce; the sauce taking away the flavor of the scallops.Bread - very dry old bread, would've expected at least warm fresh bread in an italian placeMains:Pan-friend beef tenderloin - again overpowered by the sauce (gorgonzola cheese)Piccata di Vitello alla Parmigiana - quite uninspiring, meat with a lil bit of tomato sauce and a slice of melted cheese on top. Both dishes had the same accompanying cooked vegAll in all not very inspiring. Thick sauces that take away the joy of eating the meat/fish. 2 course meal done in 45mins. Didn't even consider dessertConsidering the number of awards, I think this restaurant is beyond its peak. I will note that perhaps we made a wrong decision by choosing 2 meat dishes; though Italians are also known for their meats.
5
The food is great. Very authentic and the owner / manager is very attentive. Fairly extensive selection all across the menu, including wine and desert. On top of that, loved the rustic feel to the restaurant. Only "complaint" is parking is a bit awkward. Why not offer valet service?
4
I asked for a cosy corner as it was my bf's birthday and I got what I wanted. There is even a surprise birthday tiramisu to go with !
4
Excellent food, good service, efficient staff and nice atmosphere in an old local house. The Italian owner is always there and attentive to ensure the happiness of hiscustomers
4
Good Italian food here. Pastas are cooked well, soft but not soggy and not too sticky too. Cozy and comfortable ambiance with attentive service. Always enjoy dining here. Highly recommended!
5
This is a great restaurant for couples, friends or family. The service is good and the food is great. I love the atmosphere here. The pasta is fresh and cooked to perfection. The wine was good.
5
Big recommendation for Italian food lovers. This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore. I do enjoy the good food and the personal and and very family like service that reminds me so much of Italy itself.
4
Pasta Brava is one of the very few Italian restaurants where the waiters do not force you to order more than what you can eat. They are friendly and quick on the service. My husband and I both liked our pasta dish very much. He had the Seafood Linguine and I had the Squid Ink Pasta.We also had Bruschetta as our appetizer, which was probably the best I've ever had!Reasonably priced and we definitely will come back again!
1
This very overrated restaurant can be best be summed up by our cheese course. When asked what the cheese selection was, as you would do in a supposedly fine dining Italian restaurant, the waiter said "I don't know, they came out of a packet and they had no labels on". He then added, as if to help "that's the blue one" pointing at the obviously blue cheese but when asked what kind of blue cheese it was he didn't know.This place is all style over substance. There are many many better Italians in Singapore, Senso, Alkaff, Burlamacco to name but three. The food was bland and disgusting in parts. I had prawn covered by parma harm, but the prawn still had the shell on under the parma ham. Worse, it was covered in horrible cheese which wasn't mentioned on the menu. The only redeeming feature is that the pasta is homemade and the pasta dishes were ok but not amazing. The salad was bland, the desserts boring and out of a packet too.The people next to us had the signature tiramisu which was so watery they complained and got a refund. Really an Italian restaurant that can't make Tiramisu?Overall not impressed, don't waste your time and money. Won't be bac
5
Went on a lunch date with my partner and while the restaurant was packed, luckily, we were given a table in a minute. We ordered an antipasti: portobello mushrooms in olive oil (funghi trifolati), black ink rice with seafood (risotto al nero), homemade pasta with prawns and scallops(stracci al gamberi e capesante and for dessert: tiramisu. All the food we ordered were excellent except for the stracci, we find the portion is not that generous. Risotto has good portion of rice and seafood. Antipasti and dessert also commendable. All in all we spent close to $90. Very Good experience overall. Tanto buon cibo!a
3
...but nothing spectacular either.the carpaccio lacked taste, the ossobucco was cut into small pieces (looked a little like food out of a tin), all dishes a bit under-spiced/salted for my preference.Corkage 30 SGD is OK, setting is comfortable, but tables are too close to each other for a business meal (ie if some moderate confidentiality is needed).I would probably go again for a family meal on a weeken
3
Experience was not great as the 3 of us placed at a small table that was facing the entrance door. We booked via Chope and specifically mentioned that we want a window seat upstairs. When we highlighted the request we stated on Chope, the host responded 1st by saying they didn't see any request followed by a comment stating that they usually have issues receiving special requests on Chope
3
Many friends had told me of the (good ) repute of this established Italian restaurant in Tanjong Pagar so I finally tried it out on the 31st Dec '14 for lunch. It was practically full house but service was prompt and the hands on owner was very observant of staff attentiveness. I ordered a gin and tonic it was a reminder of most restaurant or cocktail bars in Singapore - pricey and unable to get a full shot of the real thing, but the barmaid was quick to rectify that!!!!Mushroom soup was a puree form of the vegetable and no mushrooms but still flavorsome. My main meal was the issue because the aglio olio fettucini with prawns and mussels I was served was a starter size meal, heavy on olive oil and the few prawns were the $12/- a kilo small prawns from a wet market and the clams were what is called "pipis" in this part of the world ...tiny clams that sell for $5/- a kilo also at a wet market. To me it was a $3 to prepare dish that I paid $23/- for !! a rip off !!! I regret to comment that I see many Singaporeans prepared to pay for sub standard western food and pay top price....I would rather pay $5/- for a really good laksa at a small coffee-shop!!! In conclusion I must positively comment that the owner recommended a Tuscan red at $10/- a glass which I found delightful.....and I am not easy to please in that category!!
3
I know I suppose to try pasta here as this seems famous for that. I had sliced beef dish which is quite nice for me but expensive! !! I did try my friends' pasta and have some comments on that. I dun like the tomato based pasta as I feel too salty. The homemade pasta with cheese sauce and cream sauce tasted better. Appertisers are average. I am quite disappointed with the desserts I had, probably because I felt this shouldn't be the standard.
4
My friends and I managed to make a reservation for a table to have dinner at this restaurant. Their customer service staffs are good and friendly.They serve delicious appetizers and their mains are good as well.The ingredients taste fresh and will definitely come back for more
5
I have gone here many times and have never had a bad plate of food. Never poor service and always hadcthe owner personally make the effort to greet every tableThe food is of a high quality and always tresh and hotOne ofvthe best in singapore and considering its been in existance for years says ut all.Keep up the good standards ... thank
4
Had my first dining experience and didn't expect the restaurant to be fully booked, rejecting walk-in guests. The staff were generally friendly and one even assisted us with his recommendations, although they failed to serve us water after we have sat for more than 10 mins and we had to prompt them. The squid ink was delectable, while the seafood linguine was mediocre. I personally fancy the Al Funghi Risotto, which has a slight truffle taste. The pan-fried beef with chocolate and red wine sauce was also worth a try, but best to be shared. Overall, a very cozy ambience with affordable authentic Italian dishes. Will return
5
Was advised to book this place early and I'm glad we did as it was packed. Nonetheless the service was great, staff were always attentive.We had the squid ink pasta and vongole, which were very flavorful. Spoilt for choice actually. The other dishes other patrons were having looked equally tempting as well. Must say I enjoyed the tiramisu! Will be back for more
5
My friends and I had a great lunch at Pasta Brava, the food was very good, the service excellent and the ambience spot on. We wished to take our own wines and unlike some other places which advertise corkage and yet still kick up a fuss, our experience was excellent. The staff were even happy to decant our wines, and the Maitre D even joined us for a taste! Would definitely return  
1
Hated this place! The service is HORRIBLE and food just ok for all the hype. I went here while on transit from Italy for some home food. The waiter who I guess looked the owner was just horrible. He forgot my friend's order and came back arguing that we didn't place my order. We had to wait an hour for food and they didn't even apologize. The whole time they maintained that I didn't place my order, we were a small group of 3. There is no reason for me not to place my order.We told them that we didn't like they way they treat the customer and the answer was like "so, should I apologize to you" !! I won't recommend this place to anyone who is visiting Singapore. Please try places like Mozza pizza in MBS or Otto Ristorante
5
Pasta Brava has been in Singapore for ages! This is a huge achievement in a city renowned for bars and restaurants opening and closing their doors seemingly every day.We have been dining here for 15 years, and always have a great time. The food is wonderful and the staff super friendly. The Italian owner takes great pride in his restaurant and is constantly flitting about the place serving food and looking after his guests.Our favourite dishes are the home made pastas and the calamari, which is arguably the best on the island!The atmosphere is always lively, as the place is always busy, so make sure you book to avoid disappointment.Thanks again guys for another great meal
4
We had a very nice time in this traditional Italian restaurant in Craig Road. Simple, but excellent food, with very good pasta homemade, and also a good choice of meat. Ambiance distended and friendly.Prices are reasonable, also on recommended wines.Service friendly, headed by an Italian established in Singapore since long time.Recommend for a friendly dinner
4
Authentic and very good italian food. Tbe staff could smile a bit more. Make sure to book a table. We had to wait 15 minutes for a place.
5
Dinner was great, the squid ink seafood pasta & the risotto was fantastic. Excellent service. Looking forward to the next visit.
4
We had a lovely dinner here last night. We started with Caprese Salad and then shared the Osso Buco and the Ravioli. It was all fantastic. We had a very nice Amarone wine that was reasonably price for Singapore. Great service. All in all really good and we will definitely return next time we are in Singapore
4
The resto didn't disappoint. We ordered the ravioli with gorgonzola sauce, prawns with prosciutto & mozzarella, chicken cacciatora, and apple cake with mascarpone. Everything seemed meticulously prepared, flavorful and served in good portions. Waiters were attentive and friendly. I would not hesitate to go back there again to sample their other dishes
5
This is my favourite Italian restaurant in town. The service is excellent. The owner is very friendly and gives good recommendations to customers. The dishes are very tasty and well presented. I always order an appetizer such as a beef carpaccio with rucola or prociutto with melon and I never get disappointed. As main course, I usually order any pasta dish and all of them, either baked or boiled are delicious. The desserts are fantastic, in particular the tiramisu, and if this is accompanied with a digestive such as a shot of grappa or sambuca, it would be perfect. I highly recommend trying this restaurant. I have been living in Singapore for more than 5 years and tried many Italian restaurants in town. None of them matches Pasta Brav
5
I've been there about 5 times so far and each time, service has been impeccable, and the food really really good! :) I loved the linguine regina del mare and the pappardelle al ragu. Their version of the apple pie/crumble is one of the best i've had :) ambience is lovely, they take reservations, and you can adjourn to the cosy second floor post-meal. I would definitely be going back sometime soon (yet again). :) excellent, authentic italian fare
5
Located right near Chinatown this restaurant has the best Italian food I've had anywhere on my travels. Prices were slightly expensive but the food did not disappoint. I recommend the homemade lasagna, the best I've had anywhere. Service also very good. We went for lunch and was very busy. I would come back here
4
The restaurant was nice ! But the menu was to narrow ! Could nt understand wht we need to order! Even though the menu design very ordinary paper ! Will not except this type of good restaurant ident have proper menu ! The food and wine was grt ! Only the duck was little bit dry and tough.
4
Food was great! Pasta done al dente. Aglio olio, IMHO, is one of the harder dishes to make simply it's too simple. But it's very well done. Other dishes like the sautÃ©ed mushrooms were delicious too. Basically everything we ordered that night did not disappoint us;) certainly will go back
4
I've been patronizing Pasta Brava for years and if I want to go to I restaurant I know I will have a good Italian meal, that's the place. The food is always consistent and although not off the wall sensational, it is good straight forward Italian food. The owner Rolando, walks around to make sure his guest is taking care of. My kids love the place and we eat out often at other establishments but if they are asked, its' always let go to Pasta Brava. The interior of the restaurant is very warm and friendly
1
Reasonable prices but oh so medicore quality. Pasta was reasonable but appetizers were awful. Beef carpaccio was tasteless. Buffalo cheese for the caprese was hard and inedible. Service staff was relatively attentive but sour faced. Never again!
5
I find it hard to get good squid ink pasta in Singapore, pasta brava impressed me with theirs. The ambiance is great, and menu is comprehensive without losing quality and taste. Definitely somewhere to go if you need great Italian fare.
5
Was just reading some of the negative reviews…I've been to Pasta Brava twice - once just last night. Both were great experiences - reasonable prices, decent food, great wine and delicious dessert. First time my partner and I just walked in with no reservation, so we got a crammed table downstairs - which was fine. We sat down, ate, drank… had a great time. Last night, we made a reservation and got a table upstairs. It was a lot quieter, just a few couples - which was lovely. Again, good wine, great food and for the record, we never got rushed or chased even remotely. Oh and that Malay guy some people kept ranting about? He was actually quite friendly - on both occasions when we were there.So it made me wonder what went wrong with those negative reviews… wondered if some people had behaved like their grandfathers own the restaurant. Ok I don't know everybody's story, but this "Belle_116" actually grumbled how it's the restaurant's fault to not call to ask WHY she was late. Wow...Seriously? It is appalling how shameless some people are! I am puzzled by the fact that why didn't SHE (or anyone in her party) called to say they were being delayed? Sounds like a nasty person this one… I wouldn't want her in the same dining room.So yes I WILL return to Pasta Brava - 87 (now 88) positive reviews probably beat 7 pathetic whines

A friend recommended this place for Italian and we got there relatively early. From starters to desserts we were rushed by a male Malay staff (supposedly the manager) who was curt and took away our plates before we were even done w our food. He went as far as giving us the bill when we didn't ask for it and came back every min to make sure we had settled the bill. I got really angry and asked him what was the hurry and he said there r ppl waiting for our table. Look I get that but u have been rushing us ever since we sat down. Also u shouldn't be chasing customers as soon they finish their food. Some crappy service. After he got a shelling me from me as I had requested to speak to the owner, he shouted at his staff (in front of everyone) to get him. The owner apologized but at that point I have made up my mind never to step back in this restaurant. The food wasn't that great for that price we paid. Owner was an old Caucasian dude who suggested we headed upstairs for drinks but I just wanted to get out of there. I should refused to pay any service charge. Won't be back ever there r tons of Italian places better than this toilet bowl. Save ur money on this place

I always look for set lunches so we went to Pasta Brava with work colleagues to give it a try.I didn't even look at set lunch menu, I saw special was lasagne, so I ordered it. The waiter said it was going to be a few minutes wait as they don't "nuke" it. The others ordered squid ink pasta, and the special sea bass grilled, it all looked good...I was waiting...waiting...and then viola! the hot dish came the béchamel sauce was bubbling, the real ricotta cheese OMG this was like my grandmothers deep dish dream. I took my dear sweet time to finish it all, and a good deal for $23.00. A glass of house chianti, breads, and I'm stuffed. This is a good place, all kinds of Singapore Tattler awards on the walls, and artwork, and pencil drawings, and paper and crayons for children to use. Some restaurants nowadays frown on you bringing children. This would a option.Good food comes to those that wait! Cia

Few places in Singapore are able to keep up their standard in term of Service and Food. Pasta Brava is one of them, even after being open for 20 years.A great team is in place, and give you what I call: customer service. And the food is perfect.Sometimes you do not need the extra touch in your plate, and they are going for the taste, nothing more, nothing less.Great quality of product, great cooking, great service. After 5 years going there, it is always right. Simple but good.... A great Italian in Singapore, I mean an Institution in Singapore..

Was on a business trip in Singapore. Colleagues said lets go Italian. I did a double take Italian in Singapore? However the food was fabulous. Pappardelle with Duck and mushrooms was to die for Followed with a Osso Buocco. Wine selection was extensive and relevant. If someone in Singapore asks you if you want Italian food don't hesitate, this is worthwhil

The waiters were quite mute and didn't seem very interested in the customers, but they were very efficient and did a good job anyway :) we had the bruchetta with tomato salad for starters, it was perfect and came quickly. As soon as we had finished, they came with the main course, we were surprised at how quickly it was served :) I had the ravioli filled with minced meat in a mild gorgonzola sauce, it was a small portion, but tasted excellent! My husband had the lasagna, and he loved it also :) Not to expensive either(22 sgd for my dish), so well worth the trip outside the city centre :

Probably my favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore! Food is really authentic, plating is unpretentious, and it's reasonably priced for the semi-fine dining setting and generous portions. I'd come back here again and again, and it's always nice to see that Italians dine here. Excellent service as well, though best to make a reservation before coming here. My favorite dish is a tough fight between the seafood marinara and the squid ink linguine
5
This is a very authentic Italian restaurant. It's small so essential to book - we noticed some potential clients being turned away. Our group seemed to be the only tourists among the clientelewho appeared to be smartly dressed locals and business people. The many staff were very attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed both the atmosphere and the food. These were classic Italian dishes all cooked to a very high standard.The melanzane parmigiana which we have had so many times in Italy was excellent as was the veal marsala. And as for the tiramisu - wow! - definitely enough for 2 people. If we ever return to Singapore this restaurant would be on our list for another visit

Thank you to the team of pasta Brava for making my evening a memorable one. My wife was so delighted with the excellent service and will definitely be back for more

I went there with my friends for lunch and everyone had a great time at Pasta Brave. The food was delicious and some pasta were home-made at the restaurant. Def would like to go back there again for a dinner date.
5
Fantastic food, quite authentic...good ambience and reasonable menu price. Quite a wide menu variety, try their homemade pasta, they are delicious. Though a little rich in taste but they are perfectly fine. I will recommend anyone in Singapore to give this restaurant a try, you will not be disappointed
5
The name doesn't do this place justice - Pasta Brava conjures up images of a bland high street Italian whereas in fact this an Italian restaurant with a lovely ambiance and great food. Service was extremely friendly and even though the place was full of local, well to do couples enjoying a quiet dinner my 3 year old daughter was heartily welcomed with colouring pens and a special chair. The menu is very much a classic Italian with lots of choice but this is a cut above most trattorias and the homemade pasta was delicious. Vitello tonnato was also superb. Although just 10 minutes in a taxi away from the touristy waterfront areas, Pasta Brava felt a world away. Great meal in lovely, relaxed surroundings
5
Have been eating there every now and then all the way since 2002. It has never disappointed: consistent quality, excellent and creative dishes. This last time the prawns with garlic as a starter, the rucola salad were perfect. The beef with the Gorgonzola sauce to die for. Good wines and good deserts, no wishes left open. Staff very nice, friendly interior, they found the perfect mix, and such a long term success in a competitive environment proves they do it very well! Torneremo ancora
4
Had dinner there today and would have to say the waiter was very helpful with his recommendations and attentive to our needs. Service is excellent and professional. Food quality was very good and the desserts were excellent! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would live to have good hearty italian food in a warm cosy ambiance
5
Such a cosy place ! I only go there for one thing only, It has to be mention since I haven t got the chance to come a cross to such a dish since my childwood and this is the Osso Buco ! Excellent in every aspect of it. Simple dish take talent and good produce for that I give to you, you always make it happen. Thank you

My partner and I visited here on Friday evening and had a fantastic time.The service was friendly and attentive, from arrival to departure which is something lacking from a lot of the restaurants in Singapore. A nice touch was the personal service from the Italian gentleman who has been in Singapore since 1965 and owned the restaurant of over 20 years.The ambience is just about perfect - relaxed, cosy and genuine. My partner and I asked for a couple of small changes which they accommodated with a smile - again something other Singapore restaurants should note of.To start we had a caprese salad and Parma Ham with melon - both very fresh, light & tasty.For mains we shared the seafood stew and the lasagne which complimented each other very well. The lasagne is incredible - a perfect size portion cooked in its own dish with the perfect balance of meat, tomato and cheese so not one element overpowers any of the others. For dessert, we had Tirasimu and Apple cake - both very tasty and good size portions.To accompany the food we had a lovely bottle of reasonably priced Chinati which was perfect.Overall, we had a wonderful time and look forward to the next time we visit
5
The ambience is so romantic, private yet so comfortable. The food is excellent. The portion, taste and presentation is just awesome. And the service is the cherry on top. One of the waiter came when I ordered a pannacotta. He knew that I'm a moslem and he told me that the pannacotta contains a non halal gelatine. He suggested me to order another dessert that's halal... one word for this resto is Excellent!

We went with friends to celebrate a friends birthday. The atmosphere is traditional rather than modern italian. The portions are large but the food is average. Everyone felt their pasta was overcooked and not al dante. Although the meat was cooked perfectly. The wine list is average and expensive for what it is. Their are better italian restaurnats in Singapore
5
if you like Italian food, then this experience is not to be missed - truly unforgettable. Our friends who we went with are now living in the UK and this is a restaurant that they went to many times when they lived in Singapore and was the #1 restaurant that they wanted to go back to on this vacation trip

夫と一緒に夜に行きました。ワインもお酒が高いといわれるシンガポールでもそんなに高くないと思います。ワインはシャルドネのプロセッコ（発泡）でした。料理を邪魔せずいい感じです。プロシュートもサラダもおいしい。一番期待して行った生ラビオリはクリーミーなソースととてもあっていて最高でした。このためだけにまた行きたい！あ、ただガヤガヤしてるので静かなディナーではないです。I visited the restaurant for dinner and has a good time with my spouse.We started with a glass of wine which tasted good and not so expensive, and then enjoyed antipasti. The portion of a dish of Prosciutto is appropriate, not so small not big.Our main expectation was Ravioli which you can see in many reviews and it was beyond our expectation.They offer us their homemade one which was soft and had a good harmony with the creamy and cheesy source.I definitely go there for Ravioli soon:)For the last, I didn't have any bad experiences as some of the other reviewers had

Positioned just next to Chinatown I stumbled across this restaurant whilst out looking for an alternative to Chinese or Korean style food. The restaurant has a typical Italian family style ambience - this mood is instantly set upon being seat and noting a box of crayons on the table to draw over the tablecloth. Service is excellent, waiters are well dressed in black pants and black collared shirts which further enhances the traditional Italian style dining. The restaurant was full on the Monday night, obviously exemplifying the local following of those that enjoy the restaurant. I traveling alone on a business trip hence dined alone - ordering a simple Spagetti Vongole and a cold Peroni beer. Both arrived swiftly. I much prefer Linguine Pasta when creating this dish so I'm perhaps a little biased. The meal was nice - I'd say 6/10 mostly because it was served on a plate and used Spagetti. I love this dish served in a bowl to really enjoy the delicious sauce and I think Linguine goes better. There was also way too much oil used in the dish. Ambience is great, convenient location with Chinatown and outram MRT nearby. Food is good. Prices fair - bowl of pasta $22, Beer $10. Excellent service. Recommend experience for a great alternative to the abundance of Chinese restaurants in the area

It used to be one of my favorite place for Italian food.I had recommended to a few of my friends, who became regulars.We revisited last night, since a while ago.we were totally surprised by the quality of bread they had now served!It was not even a standard bread some of the other lesser known restaurants would serve on the table.It was soft roll bread toasted hard and dry. Another friend who had visited lately were equally disappointed with the bread quality, which was suppose to be the basic. Before our start of our meal.We had ordered the appetizer -of -the -day, which is a cheese dish served with a few thinly sliced tomato and herb. The dish was pretty lacking in presentation, and unappealing. And taste was not great.Most of the pasta dishes are good except for the presentations.The other main dishes apart from the lack in presentations, the taste was average.Am definitely disappointed that the whole dining experience was not the same as before
1
Although we eat at Pasta Brava only once a year, it used to be for a sentimental reason that we look forward to. Unfortunately we will not be eating here again as the food quality has deteriorated tremendously and the service although not terrible, is very very mediocre and lack warmth and sincerity.The complimentary bread before the appetiser was served very late, 10mins after we placed our order. To our horror, it was slices of bread from a cheap baguette that looked and tasted like they were bought from Breadtalk..... 2days ago! Also, we had to ask for the balsamic vinegar which used to be served together with the olive oil from the onset.The presentation for the Brucatta cheese we ordered for appetiser was very very (cheesy" (mind the pun). Very amateurish and un-appetising. The flavours of this dish was also very bland, as good as eating mozzarella on its own.The duck liver however was ok.For the main dish we ordered squid ink pasta and breaded veal.The texture of the pasta was dine very well. al dente as it should. The pasta however was a tad bit too salty, totally overwhelming seafood. The veal tasted as good as any $4 cutlet you can find at any school canteen...... ok, maybe an additional $1 for the melted cheese on top. Otherwise it is all too simple and a travesty one had to eat such a dish at such a restaurant.We didn't dare to order our usual dessert of Tiramisu and Lava Chocolate cake as we couldn't stand being disappointed further. $124 for the above dishes and a glass of wine..... should have eaten at Pepperoni's (again) instead

This is my go to restaurant for comfort eating in Singapore and it never fails to do this. The osso bucco is probably one of the best I've had with the cremolata being perfect with just a tinge of lemon zest. The Italian owner takes real pride in his food and is very chatty when you get him going about authentic Italian food in Singapore. The service is efficient and attentive. The wine list extensive and by Singapore standards, reasonable. There are many new Italian restaurants in Singapore but I find Pasta Brava consistently dependable for the home cooking you find in many of the trattorias in Italy. Reservations in the evening is a must as the restaurant is quite small and there is no waiting area
5
I rarely write restaurant reviews but for Pasta Brava, I just had to. Perfect little gem - utterly delicious Italian food and A+ service. You have have have to visit this fantastic place. You will not be disappointed. Make a reservation before you go though as it's always fully booked! I simply love it
4
Came here for lunch during a weekday. The restaurant decor was cosy and inviting. Ordered the seafood linguinie, which was very tasty and delicious. Although, there was a mussel shell in my linguinie but no mussel and half a scallop - a bit weird! Despite that, the food was yummy, the service was alright. They only accept cash or credit card - no NETS/EFTPOS. If you feel like Italian and are in Singapore, I would recommend coming here

Dining with a group of more than 5 friends can be difficult sometimes, due to the commitment of choice of menu in the restaurant. This restaurant could take ala carte for groups of 8 thankfully. I saw the menu, very straightforward and reasonably priced too. The restaurant was almost full because we had to wait a little bit for them to relay the table. But then again, I wouldn't mind that if the restaurant had a wall filled with certificates of accomplishments.A nice place for a date or a friend's gathering. A little casual touch when the table was covered with paper and a basket of chalk was given for you to doodle on it. Lovely rustic ambience when I entered, the wood around and the noise (alike of a family restaurant). I would return again for sure to try others.From a decently priced plate of bruschetta to pan seared foie gras which was a bit small but I wasn't expecting a large portion anyway, the menu had plenty of choices to suit to your Italian cravings. They were definitely not stingy on the tomatoes with the bruschetta. The beef ravioli portion was just right, the right consistency of creaminess in the sauce. Oh! The flexibility they offered to my friend when she wanted 1 ravioli with 2 different sauces. The lady suggested it and it was quite nice of a gesture (not very often to be offered in an almost full restaurant). My friends had hefty portions of risotto and pasta that we left the restaurant satisfied
4
Authentic Italian cuisine. Service was good but not outstanding. The place was packed on a Friday night. It is advisable to make a reservation for dinner, otherwise try walking in later, perhaps after 8.30pm. Food tasted good. While portion sizes looked small, they were extremely filling and felt heavy after a few mouths
5
We love the food, the service is friendly. Great wine list. We ate here regularly when we lived in Singapore. We were so happy to find it still open when we returned to Singapore for a visit.
4
The service is fair the food good and the wine selection expensive but good. Deserves a visit if you enjoy Italian food
5
Efficient and.really pleasant service and fab food.
Busy and good atmosphere.
Risotto is just excellent
5
This amazing restaurant never disappoints. The food and service is amazing front entree to main through to dessert. The restaurant is just plain awesome with a great atmosphere. Pasta Brava also has a great wine list. What a spot for any occasion.
4
Great location, very pleasant decor, decent food, good prices (on food, anyway: wine is way overpriced). We will definitely do it again.

I've always loved Pasta Brava and I've eaten here at least 15 times in the last couple of years. They always impress me with their authentic Italian food at reasonable prices. My favourites are the parchment wrapped crayfish pasta, and the seafood linguine. The tiramisu is a must-have so do be sure to save some space for dinner. I love that Pasta Brava isn't pretentious - as are most Italian restaurants in Singapore with decent food. Every table comes with a paper table cloth and crayons to get your inner-child go wild. The service there is also always excellent. The waiters are attentive, and really know how to recommend the best dishes and wine for us. I wanted to treat a dear friend to dinner last week and made an email reservation with a request to have a customised birthday greeting on the plate with a polish phrase added. I was a little afraid that it'd be messed up - but sure enough, they surprised my friend with a tiramisu on the house with the message written perfectly! We were both wearing white and ordered 'dangerous' pasta dishes with tomato based sauces - and the waiter offered us little bibs to wear so we wouldn't stain our clothes. How thoughtful! They made both of us smile! Thanks Pasta Brava for your amazing service! :) Can't wait to come back again for my pasta fix
5
So you would think this tiny restaurant along a tiny street wouldn't have much to offer.. WRONG!! Once you step through the door you will realize that trying to get a table without a reservation at least a day in advance is pretty much futile (unless you are happy to start dinner after 9pm then maybe)..Amongst the amazing things on the menu, try the Gorgonzola Steak or ravioli.. now.. bear in mind i HATE blue cheese.. but darn.. Can't seem to stop myself coming back for more. Absolutely unique taste.. Does this place cost alot? well, abit more that a typical street type italian restaurant but trust me when I say that this I believe its the best Italian restaurant I've been to in Singapore. Really excellent food with a reasonably corresponding price and lets not forget a really good selection of wines. Will I be back again? definately - 5min from my home.
4
This place was suggested by a friend and we went there for no special occasion. The quality of the food is really good and the Osso Buco was really tender and hearty. The wine list is quite long, and prices are reasonable. The atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant was very nice as well, but a bit noisy. Service was very good. If you want to eat in a real Italian restaurant in Singapore, go there, you wont be disappointed.I'll definitely go bac

A friend suggested this place for a late birthday celebration for another friend. It was my 1st time coming to this restaurant but it was really easy to locate, just a few minutes walk from the Tanjong Pagar MRT station. We were seated at the 2nd floor, the place is dimly lighted with a homely vibe. I can see that all the seats were reserved and by 8 pm the place is full. I am not a Italian foodie but I really like the Stracci Ai Gamberi E Capesante. The thin pieces of fresh pasta were good and the cream sauce goes really well with it. For dessert, I had the Lava Al Choccolato which was too good, we ordered a 2nd helping so that we can share it. I will come to this place again
5
So this was a date night dinner for me and I wasn't the one to choose the restaurant. The guy was to see for first date, chose the place and it could be the wine or it could be that it was actually a good date, I had a great time at the restaurant.the food and wine both were fab. I had a eggplant based starter followed by the spinach ravioli which was pretty decent. They also have this concept of drawing things on the paper out at the table, that you can make use of for playing games to sketching something to anything you could essentially do with crayons and a paper. All in all good place to dine
5
Great welcome, great service and above great food with great wine.
Concluded by expresso & tiramisu ...and grappa of course !
4
It's a gem in the city with good food and pleasant service. The menu is very authentic and pasta food well prepared. You do need to make reservations because it's full house almost every day!
4
Hubby brought me here to celebrate our post wedding anniversary date. It was recommended to him by a colleague.The street where it is neatly tucked was very unassuming so I thought it was just one of those... but the moment we entered, had our reservations confirmed, was brought to our designated table, handed our menu with, and served our appetizers, I was blown away!!!! Pasta Brava is the place where you will truly enjoy a quiet dinner with a loveone, and enjoy and savor every bite that you take

Pasta Brava has been at this location under the same management, to my knowledge, for at least twenty years and I have been coming here on and off since it opened. It has always been a safe bet in terms of quality and ambiance and has lost nothing over the years. Small touches have been added and embellished, to keep it from fading and losing its edge. Such is its consistency, it can be seen as the standard, against which other Italian restaurants in Singapore should be measured. On this occasion, I came in the evening with three friends for a minor celebration. We had a selection of pastas and meat dishes. I chose Italian sausage (Salsiccia), which is a favourite of mine. The wine list has a great selection of Italian wines, although it can get a bit pricy if you don't control yourself! A nice Grappa (or two) was added at the end to polish off the evening.It used to be encouraged that you draw on the paper table cloths (chalks provided). There was no chalk this time, but some more notable past table artworks are on the walls for people to admire. One tip - the owner was a hotelier in a past life and has some outrageous stories to tell, if he can be persuaded to open up
4
Great menu excellent wine choice..staff very helpful and the Italian food choices are great for us veggies.... Staff were more than happy to get the kitchen to prepare something off the menu to ensure I was well fed....excellent environment with all the beautiful aspects of a traditional Chinese shophouse' decorated Italiano and serving Italian food.... Great evening well worth a visit......
5
Visit with friends who are Singapore residents & regular diners... Great menu & wine choice with attentive service.Always find it somewhat ironic when you find a very good Italian restaurant in the Tropics (same in KL) particularly when it had a previous life as a shop house. Decor & atmosphere would make you think you were sitting in a trattoria in Italy!Expensive but the food was really excellent accompanied by a very good Chianti Classico
4
I have business interests in Singaore and am there several times a year for the last 20. When this was chosen by an Italian business associate, the name sounded a bit like pasta fast food.I was very wrong.Execeent environment and very knowedgle staff. Our group took recommdations of mussels from special menu and a veal Milanaise which wasnt on the menu either. other fish dishes and pasta dishes that were shared by my local friends all went down a bomb. For Singapore price I found to be reasonable- 500 Dollars to include bottle of prosecco and bottle of good red starters and main courses and a couple fo excellent deserts for the six of us.. I will return.. Came our feeling very impressed and much better value than other big Italain names like Dolce Vit
5
Eating at Pasta Brava was a very nice experience. The decor is very nice, the lights and the furniture and paintings along the walls have been chosen with care and give you the impression of being in an upscale restaurant in Rome or Firenze. The food is good, however a friend of mine who is a regular there and who lives in Singapore advised me to stick to pastas since it happened to be their best product and in general he prefers not to order the other dishes. We were happy with the variety of pastas and sauces. For desserts we ordered affogato and panna cotta, the affogato was excellent but the panna cotta was very average. The house merlot was good. The service is very good and the owner of the restaurant, an Italian actually, is very attentive and asks customers if everyone is fine. It was funny that he actually complained about the serving size of one of our dishes and asked the waitress to add some more pasta! The waiters are efficient and they seemed to know their stuff well: one of them gave a sharp remark about the cheese to use with one of the dishes, a remark that I usually get at the good places in Rome. The restaurant is located in a nice area near China Town and make sure you reserve! It fills up very quickly.If I have one warning it would be the prices, although Singapore is an expensive place, I still found the prices to be high. A very good experience though
4
Visited this lovely outlet for dinner on a weekday night and it was packed (luckily, we made reservations). Good food and the service personnel were both attentive and knowledgeable. Excellent recommendations and service. Their experience and ability to handle difficult request showed and it is highly commendable. Keep up the good work. Reservations is a must, even on a weekday
4
It is not hard to find this restaurant, as it is even accessible by mrt Tg Pagar and it is just across, next to the HDB shops. If you are having lunch/dinner, it is better to make a reservation, or you risk being seated at obscure place. Come here for the food, not so much ambience, as it was very noisy, the day we went. Good selection of food, even for vegetarians, there are choices. We had cassata, and it was really nice. Ask for the special of the day, if you are lucky, you may get something not on the menu ( I guess it depends on the chef's mood?)This restaurant has been around for so many years. The fact that it is doing so well attest to its quality of food. So, if you are in Singapore and have time for a nice meal, choose Pasta Brava and you come away with good food and memories
4
Pasta Brava serves up well, good pasta. I haven't really tried much of the other stuff there besides their pastas and some appetizers. Pasta Brava does come to mind as 1 of the choices whenever I have a pasta craving in Singapore.
4
Pasta Brava is a mainstay of the Singaporean restaurant scene and it's easy to see why. It's a comfy Italian restaurant with good, reliable food, a menu with something for everyone, good, friendly, efficient service and wine that comes in a carafe.It serves as a date night, family get together, a casual business meeting or just some friends getting together for a good meal
4
The restaurant is located along a row of old shop-houses. It is a pretty nice and quiet location. Once you enter, it gives you a rustic and charming feeling. I was given a seat in a corner. Their soup of the day was sold out so quickly which is surprising cos I was there at 7pm and the restaurant is still not a lot of people. Either they cook a little and is so nice or it is not nice or they did not cook at all. Any way, I ordered1. Cream of mushroom Soup: Not bad but a bit different from what I usually have. The mushroom taste is not as rich,2 Seafood Pasta Main. There are some wine in it and it tastes pretty good. But I feel the spaghetti is a bit hard. Like under cook. But my friend loves it.3. Sauteed prawns Appetizer. The prawns are very chewy and fresh. The sauce is creamy and nice!4. Chocolate lava Dessert: It is very sweet and sinful. The chocolate oozes out when you cut something like a doughnut sponge cake. Nice!The services is pretty good. The waiter and waitress fill up you drinks without asking. Help you to open the door when you leaving. Food is served fast. Just got a small little incident. I booked 630pm but expected to late. So we quickly called up to change to 645pm. The person on the other side said no problem. Still we were late and reached about 6.55pm. Told the person at the counter and she said:"We can only hold your table for 15mins" (referring to our 6.30pm booking). Sort of telling us to leave. Any way, managed to solve the issue. After eating, I understand why the lady can be so cocky. Cos it is full house when I stayed till about 8+pm. So it does not matter for her if I cannot eat there cos any way there will be stream of ppl coming in.Overall nice place
3
The place is charming, good for a date, with charisma,... The food is good at times, depending on what you order. The service is very good and plesant.For example, some starters are bit oily heavy, some re good. The prawns with garlic slice are nice indeed, especially the sauce,... The calamari fritti are oily,...Main pasta dishes are also slightly disappointing. The vongole spaghetti is greasy and not tasty. Other pasta dishes we tried were so so, including their home mada pasta. Dessert was really good, we ordered tiramisu. It was smooth and fresh, well done.Over all it is not that fantastic experience because of the quality of the cooked dishes. It is a shame, as the place deserves a visit. I propose you get there and feel more lucky with food that I did, and enjoy the atmosphere

My partner and I had decided to checkout the Tanjong Paga area of Singapore for dinner - we hadn't really visited the area before. We had a walk around all the quaint shops and restaurants and decided we liked the look of Pasta Brava. It was around 7.15 on a weekday evening and the restaurant was already busy but had some free tables. When we went in however we were advised that all the tables were already booked! The waitress seeing our disappointment asked if we would like to sit in one of the few tables outside, although not ideal as on the pavement we said yes. I was sort of expecting a second class service sitting outside - how wrong I was. The table was quickly made up, drinks order taken and menu's provided. The service was exceptionally good through the whole meal with just the right time between courses. We had the tomato bruschetta followed by pumpkin pasta and lamb chops - all absolutely fabulous. We were so impressed with the service and the food this will become a regular for us - we will be organised and book next time so that we can enjoy the ambience inside! No wonder you have to book to come here clearly they have masses of repeat business they are so good
5
I am lucky enough to have lived within easy walk of Pasta Brava for over 3 years and eat there every couple of weeks. I can say without hesitation that it has the best Italian food I've *ever* tasted, including my 4 trips to Italy ! The Duxton area has many Italian restaurants and I've tried them all, but keep going back to Pasta Brava.I heartily recommend the scallops in bechamel sauce, all the beef tenderloin variants are delicious, and the pasta dishes are fantastic. Best of all - the wine is the most reasonably priced at any restaurant I've found in Singapore.I frequently take vising business colleagues to Pasta Brava and they now *request* a trip when they're in town. The service is great (very good at accommodating extra diners, or special off-the-menu requests), the atmosphere very relaxed, and there are frequent 'specials' which arrive un-announced (but very appreciated).Best of all, the owner is usually present to make sure everything runs smoothly. He often delivers food to the tables himself, coaches new waiting staff, and always asks solicitously if everything is okay.Frankly, Pasta Brava feels more like an extension of my home rather than a restaurant

My daughter loves pasta & friend had highly recommended us there. We made a reservation via email & was really looking fwd to the our 1st visit to Pasta Brava. Alas, we had some problem finding parking & ended up late for our reservation. The waitress & owner just told us flatly that our table has been given away. No attempts were made for the 'service recovery'.May I also emphasize that there were no efforts made to contact us to confirm if we were coming. (The staff Dino even asked me for my mobile no. when replying my email. Why bother to ask if there is no common courtesy to even call?). Neither was there any mention on my email confirmation(s) about their unheard policy of 15mins holding of reservations. It was horrible. I will never want to go there despite however good the reviews of the food or whatsoever. What a bad experience

I went for a business lunch treat by my vendor for a table of 10. Atmosphere was good and everything look great, never expected to find a place so authentic as this.Ordered a lamp chop and requested medium. Unfortunately, the lamb chops (3pcs) arrived RAW in the middle after I took a bite off the 1st piece. I requested for a change. Waiter took the dish without question back into the kitchen. When a "new" dish came back, to my shock, i was given 2pcs "fresh" lamp chop & 1pc of "1/2" lamb chop...the same piece which I have already taken a bite off. They simply sliced off the portion which I took a bite and put it back onto the grill......This is a hygiene issue and totally unacceptable. Not wanting to make a scene as it was a business lunch, I merely pushed the dish aside and pretended that I'm already full due to the greens/starters which i had. For what its worth...i'm sure they can afford some real proper hygiene

We went there once and came back again and again. With our family and our friends! This is really the place to be and whenever I want to have some good old homemade pasta. Pasta Brava is the first place I will make a reservation. Bring on the carbs!Every pasta we have so far is delightful. Our most favourite has to be Stracci Ai Gamberie E capesante. The seafood is uber fresh and the pasta texture is divine not forgetting the sauce. I hate cream sauce usually but this I cant resist! We do love their soups too..Oh can't wait for our next visit again! Price is fair and a cozy eating environment is a big plus:

Italian food is my favourite and its been few years that i developed taste for italian cuisine. Pasta Brave offers the best italian cuisine in Singapore with amazing interiors of the restaurant. It's a good choice for fine dining. Good Ambeince. Very friendly and warm. Infact an elderly gentleman(i guess the owner) takes personal interest in all the guests and i love it. It personalizes and adds a lot of warmth. And guests who walk in quite a few of them know him, its really nice to see this kind of an environment. Food is awesome. Very authentic.. straight from Italy. i like their menu. last time that i went to PB I ordered Antipasto Dela Casta,penne alla puttanesca, rissoti with seafood and white wine. for desert we had gelato alcafe and a yogurt. I love the food here.. and make a reservation before you go,.,. place is brimming with people and life.... !!!

I tend to avoid Italian restaurants for several reasons (many of which are related to carbs!) but mainly because I often feel I have paid a lot of money to eat something i could have cooked at home - especially in Singapore where the standard is not that high.However, having dined at Pasta Brava I am willing to declare an exception to this rule!Between 5 of us we tried a selection of appetisers - they were so-so.For the main courses we tried a number of the sea food pastas, a veal dish and a steak. The pasta and sauces are both traditionally but expertly prepared and the veal was great quality.Great for a lunch, or after work dinner

I really enjoyed Pasta Brava it's ticked away in Tanjong Pagar, nice wooden furniture, nothing fancy which I always think is a good sign. I ordered my staples: bruschetta, ravioli and tiramasu, and all were very very good. Finished with a complimentary limoncella and I left feeling satisfied, well fed and promising to return

This is the place I think of when I crave Italian food in Singapore. They've got a good selection of various Italian pastas, mains and desserts, but what's striking is how well they do the basic italian dishes, like carbonara, which many places don't do so well. Service is always good and friendly, and limoncello always served at the end with a smile. Love this place

I felt like being transported back in time in this restaurant. The place looks really cosy from the outside and when you're inside you feel like you're in Italy. It reminds me a lot of my visit to Europe. Old wooden furniture. They have drawing materials you can use just in case you get bored while waiting for the menu. Food is perfect, everything we ordered here is good just not the house wine. I don't like it. Order a Pinot Noir if they have it cause the first time I tried this restaurant we ordered the house wine which isn't my cup of tea.

The interior of Pasta Brava is slightly gloomy, but in a good way - redolent of peace and quiet, rather than some sort of pasta-serving catacomb, and the dark wood is decorated with various crayon portraits of staff and clientele, so it's not a depressing space.Staff were very attentive and quick to respond, and the food was terrific; my wife swears it's the best ravioli she's ever had and her mussels were great too; the pasta I had was pretty good as well, and the desserts, although nothing particularly innovative, were just as they should be.Portions are pretty big - I could hardly walk once we'd finished, so perhaps it was a mistake to have ordered the sauteed mushrooms as a starter, but they are worth stretching your waistline for - delicately soft, and intensely flavourful. Will definitely return soon

I love Pasta Brava because of its "staying power" and integrity for tasty Italian dishes for a lengthy time. I've been dining here on and off for the past eight years. The simple yet delicious dishes never disappoint when I am in need of comfort food. Equally good for a couples night out and for ladies' lunches

Have been visiting Pasta Brava for the longest time and am a staunch supporter of their "Stracchi Ai Gamberi E Capesante" basically it is sliced flat hand made pasta cooked in a saffron cream suace with fresh prawns and scallops with peppercorn...Regardless the number of times I am there I will always fall back to this dish though I have tried their Lamb Cannelonni, Beef Ravioli, Salmon Ravioli etc. I would also recommend their Tomato soup, fried calamari as well as Carparccio for starters. Any meal at Pasta Brava would be incomplete without their tasty Tiramisu and "Cassata Napoletana" - a three flavoured ice cream with amaretto!!A great place for a nice cozy date or get together amongst friends...

I visited Pasta Brava this week as I was in Singapore on a work trip, love Italian food and saw the good reviews. The place was quite busy, I was seated by myself, fairly close to a family group.I ordered a pasta dish, glass of red wine and then waited, and waited, and waited. I finished my wine and then finally the food arrived without any apology. The pasta was excellent. I tried some ice cream for dessert and the same thing happend. Overall I like the ambience and feel of the place but if you are in a hurry and the place is busy maybe think again

It's a little like walking back in time- this room seems to have been caught in a time warp. Great food- simple attentive service. Definately won't be disappointed. Try the deef friedcalamari-not oily in any way- and their pasta is fresh and delicious. Even good for asteakand a glass of red so every is pleased with the extensive menu

This is the place where I first tasted good Italian food . I loved the vongole and the mushrooms and the tiramisu until I learnt how to cook these dishes .Then it became very pricey and no longer our regular haunt.However it does serve excellent Italian , nothing cutting edge but comfort food cooked well where I bring my Italian friends who are homesick for good pasta and Chianti.

Superb ambience
Outstanding food
Always top quality
Always the best of service
If you like genuine Italian food with a twist don't miss this gem. The garlic prawns and the scallops are to die for... Never let down. Best to make reservation

My wife and I frequent this restaurant at least once a month. The vegetarian menu is limited, but it is delicious. I would strongly recommend Pastabrava to anyone looking for good italian meal

When my friend told me how good it is, I thought it would not be as good as the authentic trattorias in Italy. But my, it is bellissima! The interior is more on the fine dining side and the atmosphere is subtle, yet warm. I ordered the pappardelle duck ragout, the pasta very al-dente.. very impressed. The duck, so tender and very generous. The sauce is just right. My friend's favorite is the ravioli with gorgonzola cheese, which taste as good as the one I had in the authentic restaurant in Rome. Dessert is just so-so. As for the price, since I have dined in a few Italian restaurants myself around Singapore, IMHO it is the average that you will pay when you dined in restaurants like this. Surprisingly, even Pasta Brava's menu is $1-$2 cheaper (BEFORE TAXES, with taxes will leave more gap) than restaurants next to my apartment which doesn't taste as good. Due to service, I think it's of what is expected in a restaurant like this

I recently organised a dinner party for 17 at the restaurant, and the reservation process was really smooth. My initial email was promptly replied to by the manager.Upon entering the restaurant, I was pleasantly greeted by a waft of aroma from the food in the restaurant, as well as the lively atmosphere in this homey restaurant. The food was served promptly without compromising on taste and flavour. Indeed the much-hyped-about squid ink pasta is every bit as delicious as everyone makes it out to be. The brinyness of the squid ink really cuts through the perfectly al dente pasta, making for a most successful squid ink pasta dish!The dessert was great, although not as spectacular as the pasta dishes. My favourite is the lava cake --- I found great joy in sticking my spoon through the middle of the cake and then watching the chocolate ooze out through the holes in the cake. It was gooey and delicious. The staff were really friendly and they were deeply amused at my delight at the ooey-gooeyness of the lava cake, even offering me another one.Overall, a truly fantastic dining experience. Will come back again

I have been eating at Pasta Brava for over 20 years and have always loved it. The best Italian food in Singapore, the warmest staff, outstanding service, great ambiance, excellent selection of wines. You will feel at home the instant you enter the place. I would recommend this place for any occasion, business dinners, family meals or a romantic evening with your special someone. The Ossobuco is to die for, Melanzane Parmagiana my favorite of anywhere and the Veal Marsala is superb. I have never brought someone there that could not find something that they loved. Make sure you book a table in advanc

This is definitely one of the best restaurant in Singapore, the quality of food as for instance the hand made pasta, is fantastic and the service is well above average for Singapore and the owner is constantly there in the restaurant to check that everything is allright. The value for money is exceptional : 2 starters, 2 hand made pasta main course, 2 glasses of wine, 2 expressos at 120 SGD who can match that with this quality fo food ?!

We went to this restaurant tonight for a special birthday celebration the food and service were good, but unfortunately we should have checked the bill more closely as they charged us for an extra mains. This then makes you feel disappointed. So if you go here just check your bill carefully, maybe it was just a one off??

The sautéed scallops were super fresh and just melted in the mouth. The spaghetti cooked with seafood and squid ink was excellent. I had the grilled salmon steak which was very nice. Everyone in the group I was dining with enjoyed their meals. Service was good.Decor is tasteful without trying too hard to be Italian.It’s a nice restaurant for dining with friends, family, business colleagues, or someone special. Prices are expensive, so be prepared to shell out $80+ for two peple for lunch. Check the menu on their website to get an idea of prices if that is a concern for you.Have no idea when you can park. Better to take a taxi

We went there on a saturday night, having booked long in advance.The food is quite ok indeed - but still very expensive for the value. that could be still acceptable if we not having been rushed from the beginning to the end, first to order, then to eat up (before your plate is taken back -)) then order again for the dessert, the water, the wine (your glass is continuously monitored). All in all I would say a nice place, expensive, and an extremely unpleasant service. HEre is the customer not a guest, but a cash box, not more

I have lived in Singapore for 3 years now and this is hands down the best Italian you can get in Singapore. If you want real home cooked Italian meal this is the only place in Singapore you can get it. It's not cheap but it's simply the best

Went for lunch with a few colleagues and food was above expectation. Seafood was very fresh. The restaurant is cozy and service staffs are friendly. We had no complain. Would definitely recommend to friends.
