Very glad to find this little comfy place inside the HDB "Everton Park" bulding near Outram MRT/ Exit F/SGH. Worth stopping by there for the Coffee Gelato, SGD 4.80 for a cup.

Located at everton park, this place serves up freshly made ice creams everyday. Must try include popcorn and matcha. Thier newest outlet can also be found at breadtalk HQ at ubi area. Price is very reasonable too. $4/ scoop and $7 for 2.

Visited store at weekday afternoon. Tried a few flavours and earle grey blueberry is really awesome! But the hazenut crunch was even better (if u have a sweet tooth). In general ice cream is well balanced (not too sweet or milky). Will come back and try the other flavour. Ps: if u are a fan of durian, u should try their special durian ice cream

My friend and I tried a few flavours before we decided on the pistachio and dark chocolate ice-cream as the other flavours we tried were not something we want a whole scoop of.Pistachio has a nutty flavour and dark chocolate has some fudgy parts.The other flavours we tasted that didn't taste that good in our opinion were avocado coconut (felt a bit too oily), strawberry yoghurt (no wow), rum & raisins (too sweet and doesn't have enough rum).Unlikely to return as we felt it wasn't worth $4+ for a single scoop as the flavours were not comparable to other ice-cream places
