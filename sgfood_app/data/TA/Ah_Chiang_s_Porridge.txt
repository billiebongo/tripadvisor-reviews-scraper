Tried their fish/pork porridge and it was bland as hell.
However a friend recommended that one should eat their pig intestine century egg porridge. It was flavourful in contrast to their fish or pure pork porridge

Consistent in quality.
Good value..
Comfortable during morning before 2pm, bearable temperature.
Sit in dining. This is rare nowadays.
Clean and airly with a touch of deja vu..

Always a favourite place to have nice warm porridge. I usually go for the mixed pork or fish stomach. A pity the raw fish is still banned.

The specialty here is rice porridge. There are many ingredients to pick from. We had sliced pork and shredded chicken. The texture was smooth. The flavours were light. Which works well for healthy choice. You can add scallions, oil, soy sauce and pepper to taste.You can pay for extra ingredients. I found it to be just right for healthy choice!The wait while seated was around 15-20 minutes, a good time to catch up with family or friends.Donâ€™t forget the soybean pudding. It was excellent

Went down for late lunch with some friends on a Wednesday afternoon after 3pm. The place was not crowded and kept very clean. We ordered some side dishes to go with our porridge. We ordered the steamed chicken with ginger in oil poured over it. It was very tasty-not too salty, chicken was tender enough and not too fatty. We also ordered the smoked duck. Fortunately it was ready to be served at that hour. It was also fragrant enough, smooth textured and not extremely salty. Goes well with any type of porridge you order. The porridge. It was thick and well textured for a bowl of porridge. Not watery, thick and smooth congee-styled. The taste was just nice. Sufficiently tasty, not extremely salty. Add some light sauce if you want it saltier. Unfortunately, for $4 a bowl, it was not a very big bowl. The sliced meat and minced pork (which I ordered) was so miserly. Just a few tiny thin slices and a few bits of minced meat. Not even shape of a small ball. Disappointing. My one other friend who ordered the century egg with squid was also disappointed with the quantity of century egg and squid. And that for $5.50 a bowl! To summarize, one goes there for lightly-flavoured plain porridge with some bits of ingredients in it-fish, pork, century egg...porridge is sufficiently salted, but quantity not sufficient for big eaters. The saving grace was the chicken and the smoked duck. Price is about $10 per person with a bowl of porridge, chicken and smoked duck and a cup of barley drink. I wished there were some bits of the you-tiao or chinese fried long donut. Well, there was none

For people who are nostalgic, this is probably on their regular list. Among the best porridges in Singapore as the former owner in his 70s is looking after the pot personally to ensure that it is time to serve. Mixed pork parts is the all time favorite and remember to add meat balls.The almond flavor nean curd is very nice too but the portion is too small.The main problem is that the place is not aircond and can be very hot on some sunny days

We went to this porridge house on our ladt day in Singapore. The location is within walking distance from our hotel in Tiong Bahru.We ordered their Pork Meatball Porridge, Mixed Porridge, and their Deep Fried Beancurd.Both their porridge is good enough, although maybe can be a bit better in the flavor (a bit too bland). However, their deep fried beancurd is excellent, real crispy on the outside, soft silky inside with just a little spicy sweet and sour sauce.We even ordered the second of this deep fried beancurd.Overall, it is satisfying, good food to start the day.Although I only gave three stars, I will still recommend this place, specially if you are a visitor and the hotel is nearby. Don't get me wrong, the porridge is not bad!! Just need a little more flavor

This is where you try the old school version of the porridge, cooked using an old recipe (you can even catch the owner who is around 70-80 years old). Not necessarily a filling meal but you can top it up with chicken or fish. The broth is cooked till its soft and very appetizing
4
The porridge is great! Simple and no frills, it is a nice comfort food when you have no appetite for solid food, sick and feeling lethargic, those is one of the place to go. Get a side dish of stir fried veg to go along with it too

I love this place and visit regularly (at least weekly :) for my fix of Cantonese congee. My picks off the menu are the mixed pork and century egg congee, cold ginger chicken is a great side (although on the small side) and the watercress. I wouldn't recommend the fish congee which didn't taste fresh the one time I tried it. Could have been that day only.
5
good quality, well made porridge with an old school feel in the quaint neighborhood of tiong bahru. highly recommended.

Traditional Cantonese porridge with variable choices. I had the fish and mince pork porridge which is really smooth and tasty. They also have Yu Sheng(Cantonese style sashimi) and you tiao. Lunch is too hot for porridge and always crowded. Go at evening time is good!

Great place for a fairly quick and delicious lunch. Food is pretty quick to come out, portions are sized well, and the porridge itself is very tasty.
2
Porridge is so so, not hot when it was served to the table. Not very generous on the meat. The fried tofu is over fried. The overall dining experience was not impressive.
4
It would never go wrong with this porridge. Porridge have just the right thickness and plenty of topping. Servers are friendly and they have smoking tables too (a plus for smoker like me).

Ah Chiang's Porridge has been around for past 40 years with good quality Porridge. Prices are reasonable but the place is a bit hot and humid
3
Love the porridge here but the price have definitely gone up a lot over the past year.Now a bowl of porridge would cost around $5 to $7 depending on the additional toppings (e.g. egg or salted egg). Would probably only return whenever I have special craving. Otherwise, it would be probably more affordable to lunch at the next coffeeshop down the street or Tiong Bahru Market

Used to eat here when there was always a long queue due to the fact that the porridge was cooked over charcoal but in only 2 copper pots. The aroma and taste then was outstanding . Now that they have used 5 to 6 clay pot over charcoal , the taste is more blend . Of course there is not any more queue . It has become ordinary and nothing special any more .

This used to be one of my default places to go for porridge. Was always a well prepared with a sense of pride. But as of recent the standard and quality has dropped whilst prices edge ever higher. Maybe it's a function of operating in such an expensive place like Singapore. Maybe it's ingredients. Whatever it is, they have lost that edge. The frog porridge isn't as well prepared, missing the X factor that made it wow.

Popped by Tiong Bahru and decided to pop in here for breakfastMorning coffee in the historic Tiong Bahru district. Nostalgic ambience to have breakfast. @ Ah Chiang Porridge. I had the mixed pork porridge, which had minced pork (which is mixed into the porridge, instead of minced meat balls served at most other porridge stalls), liver, small instestine and lean pork (which I asked to be replaced). You can add an egg if you want. What’s special about the porridge here is that it’s slow-cooked over a charcoal fire, which adds to the laid-back charm of this place.I also ordered a cup of Kopi O and its aromatic and good.Great if you are looking to indulge in a bit of nostalgia and imagine the good old days when the pace of life was slower and relaxed

Nothing fancy, hits the spot for congee if you are tired of eating all the heavier Malay / Singaporean fare. Many locals seem to hang out here.

Fish is smelly, pork is like rubber. Porridge is horribly uneven and also ridiculously pricey. Stay away.

Good porridge served til late. The bean curd dessert is good too. Price is abit higher than your average hawker stall but it makes up with its quality.

This simple shop house coffee shop serves excellent slice raw fish. The porridge, which comes with different ingredients, were all very good also. I love their the century old eggs.

The porridge was ok, but not great. I preferred the place a few blocks away in the food center. I compared the two and found that the pork at Ah Chiang's wasn't very seasoned. It was basically very bland and made the porridge taste bland as well. The other place in the food center had tastier pork, which elevated the taste of the porridge

This is the first time I patronize this place. I have to pack and go during lunch time around 1.15pm. I ordered Mix Pork Porridge and it cost $4.00. Initially, I want to eat there but after 10minutes, I decided to pack it to go becos my time is running out and I will have to be at depot road in the next 10 minutes. They asked me for another $0.30 for the box for takeaway.I ate a little of the porridge when I arrived at depot road. The porridge was watery and no taste. The ingredient was so little and very disappointed - not worth the price.I will not patronize this store again

I found this street restaurant near Tiong Bahru MRT station and I just somehow guessed that it must be old. I saw that all the tables were full of people so I reasoned that it must also be a good one. I queued for a while and ordered pork porridge with an egg. Nice surprise. A bit salty when stirred. The price of the porridge was just 4S$. I must come here again. In the neighborhood there were nice old architectural buildings but not many other things to see.

The place to go for all-day charcoal-cooked porridge and yusheng. The menu is extensive - from fish (sliced, fish belly, fish head, etc) to chicken to pork (sliced, minced, balls, etc) to abalone, with the usual sides like century egg and you tiao. You know how the consistency of porridge sometimes ends up watery when you take a bit longer than usual to finish it? Well it doesn't happen with the porridge here. And I love how their yusheng is prepared. Just fresh raw fish slices with ginger, coriander, chilli slices, spring onion, sesame oil and abit of soy sauce. You don't find those tiny bits of bones that you sometimes find elsewhere. Prices here may be abit higher than some places but to me totally worth it for the consistency and freshness

If you are in the vicinity of Tiong Bahru, you should pay this place a visit. To find porridge cooked painstakingly over charcoal fire is rare, so my family and I visited on a rainy sunday for breakfast.There is wide variety of toppings (fish, pork, century egg, pig's instestine etc), plus you can order old style kopi and teh (coffee or tea with milk) in the same coffee shop.After breakfast, take a leisurely stroll of Tiong Bahru estate, where you can enjoy the art decor design public housing of the 50s

As I have stayed in Link Hotel Singapore during my stay so we explored around the area for food. We found this porridge stall tuck away in a corner of the residential area and we went for a try. It is a stall that specialize in selling porridge and I must say that it is really good. If you are going to stay in Singapore I would recommend this place for a go at their local delights
