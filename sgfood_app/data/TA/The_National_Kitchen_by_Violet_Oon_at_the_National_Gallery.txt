Had a wonderful meal here. It has lovely atmosphere and the dishes we chose were delicious. Sambal was great. Highly recommended and wont break the bank.
5
Everything was exceptional! From decor to food to service. Just a very pleasent experience. QWe were entwrtaining guest from out of town, and they loved the place.
5
I had early valentines day dinner there.
That is the best dinner in Singapore!
Thank you forExcellent Food and Service!

I was there mostly for the nyonya food. I am amazed by the food at National Kitchen. I ordered Beef rendang, Assam fish, tumeric chicken wings, rojak. I am must say comparing to something that is sold at the hawker and something sold at national kitchen, the price is alittle high. But the food I ordered are good and awesome. I will visit the other Violet Oon restaurant

This is not an easy place to find, especially if you have not read the website that states entrance is by Coleman St. There is no signage to the street and if you stand in front of the National Gallery main entrance, you cannot see a restaurant at all. As the main entrances is closed at night, it was a challenge.Having said that, the experience was almost not worth the trouble.We found the food of average quality by Singapore standards. The Rendang was fatty and the red sauce not to our liking. We also had the dry laksa noodles which were of similar quality. Both these dishes were simply unremarkable.Dessert of black rice with gula malaka is one of my favourites and I have had much better elsewhere.Generally the dinner did not meet our expectations of a special night out of Nonya food.One positive aspect is that this is not an expensive night out. About Sing$ 50 each
4
We had a great meal here in a wonderful milieu with fantastic decor and great service. Be carefulIf you do not like strong spices but they will temper the flavouring. Our winners were the Coronation chicken, the grilled prawns in broth and delicious vegetables. This really is the best of local regional cuisine. Small wine and drink list which has adequate choices for alcohol and soft drinks. An experience not to be missed but do book as much in demand

So when I asked some friends of mine for Date places in Singapore, this came up twice. - - so I just had to try.I made a reservation at 6PM.Hospitality was amazing. We were greeted at the door by Seraj. As we were seated, I wasn't quite comfortable with where we were seated. I tried not minding it but I couldn't help it. So I asked Seraj if we could be reseated elsewhere. Without hesitation he made space in the table I had requested. Just before the dinner rush came.Staff was courteous, and alert all through out. Kept my water glass full which was really important to me. The filo servers Roel and Robin assigned to us gave us recommendations on what to order. As the food came in we were thrilled. And it did not disappoint. Appetizers:Ngoh Hiang, Satay. Mains:Beef Rendang, Butter Prawns, (a vegetable dish I forgot the name to) Dessert:Kueh Beng Kah (on the house) Me and my Girlfriend had a wonderful time indulging in the food. She was excited and I was well fed with food that was delicious. Would definitely come back

My wife and I enjoyed our first experience of dining out in Singapore. The decor at The National Kitchen by Violet Oon at the National Gallery was superb and the service was outstanding. We both found the food to be excellent and very much to our taste. The only drawback was the simultaneous arrival of a large party of international museum staff whose enthusiastic conversation was too loud to allow us a relaxed pleasant evening
4
I keep coming back here for the food which always tastes fresh and as familiar as home made food. But the service is slow at peak hours- my chili padi took forever to arrive, and its noisy as hell. They should do something to drown the sound, like reviewing the soft and hard furnishing. And just a thought- how about some more vegetarian items on the menu.
5
Lovely interior decoration. Friendly and helpful waiting staff.The cod laksa lemak was fragrant and fresh, however it will pale in comparison beside the stronger flavoured beef rendang. So taste the fish first! The duck soup was well brewed and not too salty. Fragrant and fluffy nasi lemak
5
This restaurant offers good food in a charming atmosphere. The restaurant is located within the National Gallery, the food is traditionnal Singaporean food and was delicious. Good wine choice as well and excellent service. I definitely recommend it.
5
Very good atmosphere with delicious food. we had afternoon high tea ,love their nyonya desserts . üëçüèª
5
Dining at Violet Oon no matter the occasion is an event in itself. But when you are there for a celebration, the staff puts in extra thought and effort to step it up a notch even more. Bravo!

What a disappointment.Service Service was above and beyond. One of the best I've experienced in Singapore. Wait staff were attentive and pre-empted my needs. They were genuinely concerned for my experience and listened to feedback carefully. When a problem arose they dealt with it immediately. I was not charged for the ayam buahkeluak. 9.75/10AmbianceImpressive. Very art deco. Well executed and I expected to see some bejeweled flappers waltz in, fancy furs flying. Really nice place for a first date of afternoon tea. Will review the tea another time. 9/10FoodSayur LodehInitially I was excited to tuck in. The aromatic spices and herbs created an enticing aroma that wafted over my olfactory senses. The rich coconut sauce enticed with its lovely colours. Vegetables were nice and colourful, cooked to perfection in terms of texture. Initial taste left my taste buds delighted, but unfortunately an undercurrent of staleness ruined the experience of the dish. I couldn't tell if it was the piece of tofu fried in stale oil or the coconut milk that had turned and was accidently used in the dish. Pity as it was seasoned well with a finely balanced aromatic and spice mix. 5.5/10Ayam BuahkeluakAs they say the proof is in the pudding and any good Nonya establishment's proof is in the desserts but more importantly it is in how well the ayam buahjeluak is done. The version served at the National Kitchen left a lot to be desired. For me the ayam buahkeluak is the flagship that carries the weight of expectation. And for the National Kitchen it fell far short of expectations. The base rempah (key spice and herb mass pounded to create the base of the dish, the foundation if you will) was lacking in complexity and depth of flavor. Primarily because they didn't reserve enough of the nut for the rempah. In traditional nonya cooking about half the nut laboriously extracted is pounded with other spices and herbs while the other half is seasoned and reintroduced to the nuts to be cooked in the base. This has the lovely effect of making the sauce which the meat is stewed a complex m√©lange of tastes that span the spectrum of sour to savoury. In many cases the sauce itself is sufficient to be slathered over steaming white rice to achieve foodgasm. Another difficulty with their interpretation was that the chicken was obviously frozen. The freezer burn was apparent and I suspect that it wasn't thawed completely before being thrown into the boiling sauce. In a perfect world, they'd be pan seared to brown them and dispel any freezer taste before being introduced to the rempah.Nuts were stuffed full of buah keluak goodness but a bit more quality control would have ensured blissful paradise as some stale nuts had made their way into the mix. 4.5/10Pong Tauhu SoupA sad sad soup. Broth was somewhat muddled and used commercial fried shallots that aided in only clouding the soup. Prawn taste was apparent but underwhelming. Base broth was lacking in body. Meatball was abysmal in that it was pretty much stale. Perhaps even made and cooked the day before. It was lacking in seasoning; the texture was mushy and the prawn and crab were absolutely drowned out by the low quality minced pork used. 3/10Kueh Beng KahTaste is spot on. A divine dance whose ending could have been better. But a good attempt nonetheless. Texture is a bit heavy. Coconut cream came from a box but I understand the pressures of a commercial kitchen yet at the same time little touches could have been added to it to elevate it. 7/10Kopi (Coffee)Elevated yet very local tasting coffee. Quality is apparent. Fine representation of the potential of what locally roasted beans can do. 7.5/10Home Brewed Ginger BeerLovely interpretation of the drink. Light and refreshing, perfect for the tropics. Not overly sweet with hints of nutmeg. 7.5/10Overall an acceptable experience despite the shortcomings of the food though there is much room for improvement. This is one of the rare instances where excellent service and finely appointed ambiance combined to counter mediocre food. Hope they can improve the quality of their food to match their aspirations to be the "National Kitchen" for as it stands now the food offerings aren't on par with this lofty ambition
5
Exceptional service, a beautiful room and tantalizing flavors made for a perfect evening. Both adventurous and non-adventurous eaters will find something to love on the menu. Our server patiently explained many of the dishes to us, and provided good recommendations. The only disappointment is that they were out of the ingredients for Singapore Slings. A must-do for any visitor to Singapore
5
It was a lovely experience at national kitchen. The place was packed but the crews were fantastic, even explained how to eat the Buah Keluak Ayam dish which is very authentic nyonya dish.We had a wonderful time and the satay and Buah Keluak Ayan we're fantastic. The only thing we felt a little off was the dry laska which was too dry.
5
We had a company group dinner with 25 people. The setting is just beautiful with classic chandeliers, linen tablecloths, the works. Food was fantastic - we had three courses -- three appetizers, five entrees, and two desserts. Every dish was delicious and served at the correct temperature, cooked to perfection. The service was outstanding. I would highly recommend for a romantic night out, business dinner, or group event
5
Great nonya cuisine, although on being pork-free they miss out on the pork dishes, but I have to say for all the other dishes, Violet Oon provides one of the best tasting peranakan food there is. Excellent, I brought my parents to her other outlet at Bukit Timah and they were equally impressed!
3
For the price, the food quality was pretty mediocre. Would have been better if the serving staff also provided a brief introduction of the high tea dishes that were served. I‚Äôve been to many different high tea places in sg, and VO is the only place whereby there was no verbal introduction done at all. In addition, the staff also couldn‚Äôt get our drink orders right. We only got the correct drinks on their 3rd try. And it wasn‚Äôt anything complicated, just the local kopi-ping!Food aside, the restaurant ambience is definitely affected as it was too noisy. My friend and I had to raise our voices just for us to be able to hear each other. It was not a good experience and I will not revisit anytime soon.
4
Love every bit of the cod and laksa sauce. Laksa sauce was fragrant and rich which complimented the cod fish really well. Not too oily, very flavorful I must say. The kueh pie tie is also pretty good. Portioning was good but according to the menu shown it is on a pricey side as it is more towards fine dinning but service is lacking as waiter is less attentive. Ordered my drink and reminded countless times yet it was not served. Pretty frustrating to be told your drink is sold out only to see it being served to someone who ordered it later. Dessert was on the sweet side, a lil too sweet for my liking. I would say the food is overall yummy and will visit again
4
The staff was patient to introduce the food to try out as first-timer to peranakan food. My overseas guests were delighted to taste the food that is of local flavoring.
4
I popped by for lunch, between visits to the various exhibition. Food is good but the staff are the stars of this place. They are pleasantly attentive and friendly, really made me feel welcomed. Reservations essentials.
4
Since I have been here numerous times, thought I should try something different this time - Gado Gado. Portion is huge! Suitable for sharing. Again, the food and service never disappoint me.
5
exquisite peranakan restaurant, warm and friendly service from staffs. relatively quiet, awesome for a romantic dinner or great for small groups.
4
Food was really one of a kind. Really hits home as the peranakan dishes are well executed. Dry laksa was really good but the prawns could be fresher. Desserts were really yum too!
5
ambience and food was great! staff were friendly and they gave me a free photo printout of me and my hubby. really loved their tapioca cake dessert!
5
I tasted a variety of new foods all recommended by our server during a wonderful business lunch. The space was beautiful and comfortable, with sharp service. Nice view from the museum make it special, too bad I had to get back to the office!
5
ive been thinking violet oon resto must be super expensive given that the location is in national gallery and the name is so popular. but in the end, our bill is so cheap that 4 of us just split it and everyone contributing 37 dollars only. the food is heavenly . and the staff gives u a feel good vibe. very pleasant and accomodating
2
Firstly the good: the setting for Violet Oon at the National Gallery is lovely, a small cosy restaurant with very attentive staff. The pictures here do justice, so judge for yourself.However, the food and pricing leaves a lot to be desired. Dishes are all Malaysian, and I was looking forward to trying something different from my "go-to" Malaysian restaurant order of a Laksa. We started with a bottle of Prosecco for S$100 (¬£55, US$76), which was cheeky having paid S$80 (¬£44, US$60) the previous night in the SkyPark on the roof of Marina Bay Sands!! My girlfriend ordered the Dry Laksa (S$22), an unimpressive dish complete with prawns so overcooked they had the consistency of rubber, whilst I had the Beef Rendang, which overwhelmed with meat in a very small amount of very spicy sauce. I'd run out of sauce before eating a quarter of the dish, and didn't enjoy the remainder.All in all, we paid S$241_Service+GST ($283.65) for three of us, two starters, three main courses and one dessert. Distinctly overpriced, below average and none of us would even consider returning
2
I had one night out to dinner ins Singapore and no reservations. I scoured over TA reviews and tried to get into many places. A lover of art and architecture, I thought, wow, this looks great from the reviews. I don't know who ate here, but they don't know much about food from the reviews. The staff is lovely-we were walk ins and they managed to seat us at the bar and still serve a full menu-but oh goodness...they either don't know the menu well or...I don't know. The food was awful, dreadful. I could barely eat it. And it's gaspingly pricey. MY review of poor is based soley on the food and the dismal Singapore sling. They just don't do anything right here..all of it was bad to the bone. The space and the museum setting are picture perfect. the staff is very well trained..I just don't think they know the darndest thing about food. Anyway...if they get the food act together, this would be a top notch restaurant..in the meantime, you need to pass
5
It was an awesome experience, highly recommend the sambal petai with prawn and dry laksa. The staff even offered to heat up our dishes due to one of our guest was running very late for our lunch.
5
A great restaurant for those who wish to sample authentic Nonya / Peranakan food set in a beautiful environment.
5
We went there for high tea and celebrated my friend‚Äôs birthday. Staff were really attentive and made our day when they presented the birthday girl with a photo they had taken for us.
5
National Kitchen is a place to experience upscale peranakan food. With great authentic flavors and food done to perfection, this place is a must try if it fits your budget. Everything on the menu is great especially the big fat satays!
5
We have an enjoyable evening at the restaurant. The service was good and attentive. Food was good as expected. The restaurant peranakan deco is very nice.
5
The food is delicious and the decor is lovely. Reservations are required for this small and popular restaurant. The service was excellent and professional. The only negative is that the restaurant is noisy. There are many tables in a small space and the volume was quite loud. Our favorite dishes were the satay and the meatless meatballs.
4
In a beautiful building and location, the restaurant is somewhat hidden without good view unless you sit outside. The food was well prepared and is an elegant presentation of local cuisine in a form that will impress guests. However, I found some of the dishes too salty and strong in taste. The service was nice but the staff was not particularly helpful on the food recommendation.
5
I had dinner on Finnish National Day in National Kitchen together with my family, my parents and my sisters family. We got a call before arriving that our table is not ready yet. This did't matter because we were taken care of very well! In fact we got to sit outside in the gallery!We let the waiter decide what we would eat and it was a good choice, everything was very good and we got to taste lot of different things. All in all a very memorable dinner! We will come back and I recommend this to everyone going to Singapore!Thank you very much National Kitchen by Violet Oon

Called the reservation number on a Sunday, told me it was fully booked but I could go down and wait. I said I didn‚Äôt mind waiting. Reservation hotline told me I could go down and wait for a table, and join the queue.Drove down immediately and arrived within half an hour, hoping to have a nice family dinner. Basically got told that they are fully booked, and was told to go off to their other outlet? I told him I didn‚Äôt mind waiting and they just said they‚Äôre unable to accommodate my party that night. It‚Äôs a ridiculous mismatch of what I was told on the phone and what I experienced at the restaurant itself, should‚Äôve told me that they were absolutely unable to seat anyone else for that night, and there was no chance even if I went down, and not for me to go down and find out. Wasted a good amount of time, dampened our moods, and also wasted our parking fee at the national Galler
5
Had lunch here to celebrate my mom‚Äôs birthday and she really enjoyed it. Staff were super attentive and friendly. We enjoyed every dish, and got a nice slice of warm tapioca cake with a candle to top off the celebration. Great place for a classy and cosy meal
5
Beef rendang, creamy laksa cod and nasi lemak rice is a must have! Dessert not so.
Service was excellent, definitely warrants a visit.
5
the dry mee siam was super spicy but very delicious! we also had the kueh beng kah, the best tapioca cake we've ever tasted! the service was really good too.
3
Tried the first time in this restaurant. The decor and enviornment is unique but a bit crowded. The service is satisfactory but not very attentive.
4
Food and service were good but I was assigned to a table by the window near the entrance for 5 person and the corner seat feels very cramp and too warm to enjoy the food and experience.
5
Went there with local friends from Singapore who are food lovers like us.My wife actually recommended to go there after reading about Violet Oon. We sampled through various starters and main dishes and were really amazed by the quality of the food. When you think about Peranaken cuisine you tentatively think about Hawker Centre Food. Violet Oon and her kitchen takes it to a different level. Every single dish we sampled was flavourful and nicely presented. As only one example the beef rendang was so tender and lean and wonderfully spiced, literally mouthwatering.We also had an exceptional service. 'Clover' was super friendly, very attentive and made us feel very welcome and special. I can highly recommend that place and will go back next time I'm in Singapore
2
Had ordered the dried mee siam amongst other dishes and was disappointed to receive laksa noodles in non-spicy sauce with a few prawns. Was of course expecting the traditional beehoon. The Satay was a little too fatty with chunks of chicken skin in between. The abacus beads were too bland. Though the ambience was good and service very attentive, we have had better Peranakan food in Singapore.
5
Me and my husband went there for dinner with our 2-year old son. Everything went very good. The team is very kind and helpful. The food Was amazing. We ate the beef cheek and the chicken with coconut. Dessert was super good. The staff was super helpful also to find us a car.
5
We booked before arriving in Singapore based on the photo's and reviews. We weren't disappointed! It's a little strange being in the Gallery but once you are in the restaurant itself it has a welcoming, historic ambience. The staff were polite and attentive and the food VERY good. We had the Coronation Chicken and Tumeric and Lemongrass chicken wings to start. Both very good and generous helpings, particularly the wings. For main course we had the prawns Udang Goreng Chilli, the Beef Rendang, Sambal Egg Plant and Nasi Lemak Rice. A great mixture of flavors and all quite spicy hot but nicely toned down by the rice. By the time we got back to the menu for dessert we could hardly move! A very good meal and strongly recommended.
4
We visited the Singapore Galery to see a collections of the Masters of impressionist,which was great collection worth visiting.To our surprise we passed by the resturant in the 2nd floor which was amazing and normally you need a reservation to get a seat.The food is a collection of Area culture it is a mixer of Indian ,Malay, and Chinese Cousins, which have fantastic taste.We tried starters and main dishes,all without exceptions are great.If you visit Singapore go for it , great pleasure and fantastic taste
3
The service here is clumsy and rushed. They don't give you enough time to look at the menu.I ordered chicken satay and dry laksa. Both were average.I sat at the bar as I was dining alone. The bench had not been properly wiped and I had to point this out to waitstaff. The bar seats 3 and is in a claustrophobic corner of this tiny restaurant. Noisy because of all the hard services.I liked the gorgeous colours in this restaurant but I probably won't be rushing back.
5
Great atmosphere and food with a very reasonable price. A must do visit when you are Touring in Singapore.
5
We had a great dining experience at The National Kitchen - splendid flavours and great service. The fact that the restaurant is located right in the National Gallery gives it that extra something special.
5
Service was also amazing as they are informative and very kind. The apetizers are delicious. The satay is a must.
5
The quality of food is consistent. Chicken satay was flavorful, tender and substantial. Ngoh Hiang filling was well done with nice amount of meat, prawn and chestnut. The pulut Hitam dessert with coconut ice cream was to ‚Äòdie for‚Äô.
5
Have eaten at National Kitchen previously. Sayur lodeh has remained my favorite. Staff were friendly too. Restaurant is usually packed hence tends to be noisy.
5
Foods were superb. Friendly staff. Great atmosphere. We‚Äôll definitely go back again soonest with my family
4
My 2nd or 3rd time here. Fancy peranakan restaurant in the national gallery
Ordered the usual , and more - chap chye, buah keluak, lodeh, etc. Portions are small but ok for small eaters
Service is very good
5
Thoroughly enjoyed a most satisfying lunch with family there today. Service staff were excellent. Knowledgeable, courteous and most efficient. Rowel was outstanding and his personalised service most appreciated! Food was exquisite. Flavours were reminiscent of the very best Peranakan home-cooking. Surely this must undoubtedly be one of the best, if not the best, Nonya-Peranakan restaurants in our tiny island state. Absolutely worthy of its name "National Kitchen". Hesitate no longer! Reservations are a must
5
They have 3 outlets in Singapore, however this outlet is extremely crowded due to the strategic location. So I have been to their another outlet in Bukit Timah, in comparison of their service here is way better. Normally I get extremely upset when I have not started or finished browsing the menu, the server keep pushing me to order dishes. Also each outlet have their own specialist dishes, so I have ordered the following dishes:Kuay Pie Tee SGD17 - I think they comes in 8pieces with Sweet sauce and Chili paste by the side. It's really nice but too huge of a portion for two of us.Beef Rendang SGD23 - Extremely tender beef, every mouth seem to be melt so well. Alittle too spicy for me - as I could not take spice well. Not sure if the sauce is pre-cooked, guess I will check with them during my next visit.Cod In Creamy Laksa Sauce SGD35 - Less spicy in comparison with Beef Rendang. The cream is pretty appetizing that goes really well with my rice. Not to forget they have 3 choices for their rice, we have opted for Nasi Lemak Rice SGD2/bowl.Kueh Beng Kah SGD9 - Their highly recommended dessert. Well it is nice but not fantastic sort.Lastly we have also ordered white wine, is it perfect to go along with our food however my partner was allergic to it. Mount Nelson Savugnon Blanc 2013 either you can go for SGD18/glass or SGD85/bottle
5
I Wanted to visit this restaurant for years and today I was finally there! The place is smallBut extremely comfortable and chic, in line with the architecture of the National Gallery.The food is amazing and I have to say worth the price... a must for Singapore visitors
4
Second visit. Love the interior decor. Great service from attentive staff. Great tasting Peranakan menu. Just a little noisy due to group booking.
4
they have good food but peolle are too loud. not eligible for family gathering
I wouldnt recommend it to my friends
3
It's a beautiful restaurant no doubt, though there are better places to enjoy good Peranakan dishes. I enjoyed the Buah Keluak Noodles which is delicious, but the Dry Mee Siam failed to impress. Service was very good nevertheless.
5
It's my 2nd time having dinner in this restruant, booked 2 weeks ago, really popular. My family enjoyed the food and service.
5
excellent food
excellent value
excellent service
excellent ambience.
great dinner place. highly recommended.
5
Restaurant always fully booked but they accommodated my lastminute requests to add guests to my table - family friendly as I had a toddler and an infant too! Service excellent and friendly as usual and food was great! Will definitely return.
5
I have been wanting to visit the National Kitchen by Violet Oon ever since it opened in the National Gallery. Reservations are sparse so decided to try for lunch. Violet Oon is a local celebrity and I loved the idea of eating tradition local dishes made by a true chef. Lunch was even better than I imagined and they were extremely helpful regarding food allergy and dietary concerns. Our server, Clover, was extremely knowledgeable and guided us through menu options. We hope to return to the National Kitchen or one of the other Violet Oon restaurants in Singapore soon
4
Went there for High Tea with my family and also a chance to see the national gallery for the first time. Lovely restaurant with a turn of the century Parisian cafe/restaurant decor and ambiance. Relaxed atmosphere and professional waiting staff. The 4 of us had the high tea, which was peranakan style pastries we are all familiar with. The price was reasonable for posh high tea. Food was not bad and the coffee was actually very good for local type coffee.Place to impress someone or to give yourself a treat and escape from the crowds.
4
the food is very good. we ordered dry laksa, chicken wings and satay for two persons which to our surprise is only a total of SGD 58. Not expensive. Decor is elegant but the place is too noisy, and it isnt as spacious as what i saw on the pictures.one thing which i do not like is the service, not because they are friendly or slow but because they rushed us out. we didnt even have time to complete our last drinks, and they came to us with the bill. you have to let your customers finish everything before they leave, even though we did not have the intention to order desserts
5
Although a bit hard to find in a remodeled wing of City Hall and part of National Gallery, well worth booking-advance reservations essential. Appetizers very creative and main courses likewise. Ask about spiciness of dishes. Beef Cheeks almost too spicy to eat. Pineapple cake superb. Decor and service reinforce the quality of the restaurant
5
When our reserved table was delayed by the dining parties, the service staff made it a point to ensure we are well attended and the nice gesture offered by the team simply delighted us. We were also greeted by yummy food.
5
Classy decor, terrific staff, small but nice wine list, extremely good food. Make this your ‚Äúelegant‚Äù dinner in Singapore.
Negative: tables too close to each other.
5
Food and service were excellent.
The server (too bad I did not get his name), went above and beyond.
Love the lacquer pieces that came from Malcolm's personal home collection.
Would definitely go back and recommend to foodies and people who appreciate quality.
3
Booked Violet Oon for a special birthday dinner.
It's a small restaurant in the National Gallery and a little difficult to find.
The beef rendang is as described by other reviews was delicious. Everything else was average.
For me the visit was disappointing.
5
We loved it!
The service was superb
The ambience was great
Be sure to take a look at the terrace as well
5
Service was very good. Though the food comes in small portions, that are sufficient for 2 to share. Nice ambience.
3
Beautiful traditional Peranakan restaurant in Singapore National Art Gallery. Unfortunately, the food is mediocre and the service service is poor.
5
As a local, I highly recommend Violet oon‚Äôs National kitchen as being as authentic as Peranakan (aka Nonya) food will get in Singapore.As part of the Straits Settlement, with Chinese immigrants arriving in different numbers in different periods over the past 500 years. The points where they arrived in smaller numbers they interacted with the indigenous Malay (and Indian) population and created a unique matriarchal community called the Peranakans as reflected in their language (speaking a mixture of Malay and Chinese), rich culture and food.The food is a rich gravy based assortment of chicken, beef and sometimes pork. But the acquired taste (if you are going to marry a Peranakan girl) is ‚Äúbuah keluak‚Äù - very difficult for some but a must delicacy for the natives.Kangkong is the village vegetable. All served with pungent belachan (chilli shrimp paste) etcThe appointment of the restaurant is befitting the status of a ‚ÄúNational‚Äù kitchen. Definitely a destination
5
What a find! Beautifully decorated, busy little restaurant serving fabulous peranakan food. We had the Buah Kelua (Pangium Edule) and it was perfectly cooked. Also had the Prawns in Chilli and the Tapioca Cake to finish off. Service was quick and efficient. Fortunately we went early in the evening (on a week day) and were able to be seated for the 6pm seating. They only do two seatings so best to book. Highly recommended.
2
This had been probably the meal I looked forward to the most, informed mostly by the reviews on TripAdvisor. Unfortunately it ended up being the one I least enjoyed in Singapore. The location is very unique, and it was a bit confusing finding the place. Thankfully I had read the comments here about entering from the Coleman St side of the building, but even armed with that we walked right past the entrance thinking that it was locked down. Regardless, once we sorted that out we made our way up to the restaurant. We arrived a little early, maybe 40 minutes, hoping to have a drink at Smoke & Mirrors but that place was packed and I foolishly hadn't made a reservation. So we went and had a drink at the outside terrace of the National Kitchen. This started the rapid decline. One of the drinks on their menu was out, and when my husband ordered a martini with 2 olives the drink arrived with no olives and it was honestly the worst martini he's ever had. It was basically a glass full of vermouth. Nearly undrinkable. Regardless, our table came available shortly so we transitioned there. After sitting for about 15 minutes with no menus and no visit by a waitperson, we finally flagged somebody down. That's kind of how the evening went. The service was terrible and we were always having to flag somebody down for things. Just not what we expected from a place that seemed to be so well put together. The food was OK. Seemed very fresh and good quality, but unremarkable. In fact, writing this review about a month later I cannot remember a single dish that we had. Something with seafood that we didn't care too much for, but beyond that I honestly don't remember anything about the food. The lasting memory of this place is that it's a very pretty restaurant, with a few too many tables, and really poor service. That's not the lasting memory they were probably going for, but that's what I got
5
Loved the special degustation menu. The service was super friendly and really attentive!!! Highly recommended!
4
Nice place in the national gallery, very cosy though a bit noisy. Service was good but perhaps a bit too quick: we had the impression that they wanted to change customers every 45 minutes!
5
I have been several times and always had a fantastic experience. Food is delicious and beautifully presented, service attentive and restaurant brings you back to old colonial charm.
5
This is a great place to bring foreign guests to experience the peranakan heritage through food. Great service great atmosphere great memories created.
5
Great food - beef cheek was stunning - and fantastic friendly service. Would highly recommend. Lovely setting and interior.
5
Went to this restaurant twice. Food is great and surprisingly very good value for money given the location (national gallery).
Service is fantastic and staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.
Be it for a business lunch or a date, this place will not disappoint

The restaurant is small and it seems like reservations are necessary at least two weeks out (not a place you can just walk in) but, once you get in, the food and service are superb!My wife and I really enjoy peranakan food and this was a total joy. Every dish was delicious
5
From the decor, to the menu design, ambience and food, this place gets everything right. If you're looking to take your parents somewhere memorable for a traditional taste of the region without having to risk stomach issues at the local warung, look no further. It's also perfect for a nice lunch or dinner with friends or family. Highly recommended

I recommend National Kitchen for out of town visitors. In terms of dining, the space can get a bit noisy, but the decor is nice, service is good, and the location in the National Gallery is unique. In terms of food, the satay was the best I've had in Singapore. Laksa was also solid. I wouldn't recommend the chicken rice, because it tastes more like an adaptation than the traditional recipe.I was disappointed by the chicken rice

The location of this particular restaurant of Violet Oon in the old Supreme Court and City Hall, renovated into what is now Singapore‚Äôs National Gallery is a sure winner. The old colonial buildings evoke the romance and charm of a gone by era and its architecture of the buildingalone is worth the visit.The restaurant is small and compact and I feel the tables are too close together. There are some seats at the ‚Äòbar‚Äô for single diners. The music was far too loud, and despite turning down the volume twice at our request, it was still far too loud to carry on a conversation without raising your voice! I thought the choice of music could be improved too.The menu is not big but adequate. Three of us shared kuah pati, ‚Äòngo hiang‚Äô, rendang, kangkong balachan and one fish dish. They were not big serves, but we had ordered more than what we needed, there was plenty to eat. The food was very good, but not exceptional, which was what I expected for the prices they were charging. Service was very good though.It was a good experience, but as there are more authentic Peranakan restaurants which more reasonable prices elsewhere in Singapore, I‚Äôm not in a hurry to go back
4
Price was also reasonable in view of the good foods served. the Attitude of servicers was also very good and cheerful.
3
The location in the National Gallery is interesting given the building is closed in the evening except for access to this restaurant. The food was good but certainly was not amazing. The service was rushed as it appeared they turn the tables frequently. The rushed service may have impacted our perception of the food as we were left with the impression that they wanted us in/out quickly so we weren't able to savor our meal.. All that being said it's worth a try as perhaps we were there on an exceptionally busy evening
4
The decor is really nice, even though the space is rather limited. A very bothering thing is that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s extremely noisy, and not sure it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s because of the layout or just because of very noisy patrons.Food is good, but not amazing: gado gado and no meat meatballs were impressive, while the rest was just fine. You find better variety and taste for Peranakan food in many other places in Singapore. Service is kind but a bit overwhelming and confused.Prices are reasonable.

Booked for parents visiting working family members - two out of four of us had been before with good memories. Restaurant was full on a Monday and buzzy. Service good but a little disjointed with several serving staff. Starters were excellent - kuay pie tee traditional bamboo and turnip and the ngoh hiang was particularly delicious. The beef cheek main was exceptional as well as the cod in laksa sauce. Strangely our messy paper placemats were just wiped rather than replaced and napkins were thin paper which didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t match the service and restaurant prices. Also it would help to know dish portions - the fish head curry would apparently be suitable for two. Would always come back here though as it is so special
5
Ok. Now first my mother - she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s old and very fussy about her meals. She√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a dab hand at making a curry. She says it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a 5... who am I to say otherwise?We had a Beef randang, chicken penyat and aubergineBest in my opinion was the beef - tender and melt in your mouth. Lastly thanks for making the old lady happ

I have yet to have a meal at this restaurant that I didn't like! I also go there especially for the Collyer, a gin-based cocktail made with pear pur√É¬©e garnished with rosemary. If you want excellent Peranakan food served in an atmosphere befitting such delectable food, then the National Kitchen is a sure winner. This time my French (Parisian) friend and I both ordered the cod in a Laksa sauce and it was a perfect! We also adored the Coronation Chicken in Wantan Leaf Cup starter and the Roti Jala dessert. Service is impeccable and on this most recent visit we were very fortunate to see Ms Violet herself! If you haven't been yet, you are missing out. Book ahead, it is popular
3
Went here Saturday evening 4th November 7pm.Decor in the restaurant is amazing as can be seen from web pictures. Unfortunately there were a couple of large groups who were very loud but I think the decor being mirrors and tiles amplifies this. We had trouble speaking to each other half way through the meal. The Food is very very average and you would likely do better at a local Hawker centre. Unfortunately as is usual for Singapore the service was also poor with no real structure. Seemed like a lot of chiefs and no Indians. Will certainly not be going back
5
The place to sample Singapore√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Peranakan culinary heritage in a classy 1950s setting.Food tastes amazing and the servers are attentive and knowledgeable.The house pours are reasonably priced (compared to similar restaurants) too - about S$75 for a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon.Dinner for 6 was around S$450 (we had two bottles of wine)
4
On arriving at the Gallery, it is not obvious where the restaurant is situated, but thankfully there was a security man at the building entrance, who gave us directions, but once we got to the top of the stairs, it sounded like we were approaching a school dinner hall!I had made our original booking via email and it was confirmed via email, months before our visit. However, when we arrived we were told our booking was for the following evening - something of a shock, but at that point I didn't know for sure if it was my error or theirs. Have since found out that when they transferred the booking to their electronic system, there was an error made - right time, wrong day. My error was not checking the automatic notification sent by their booking system, otherwise I would have realised the error.However, regardless, the young lady in charge of the floor that night, said she would try to find us a table. She came back and said she could only offer us one outside on the terrace. Given the volume of the noise inside, we were thankful for being given this option. Anyway, we were passed into the charge of the waiter attending the guests on the terrace and seated at a high table on cushioned bar stools, right opposite the Marine Bay Sand - ideally situated to watch the light show from the top of the building. And it was lovely to be dining outside, as there was a large fan giving a pleasant breeze.The menu wasn't quite what I had expected, as there were dishes originating from countries other than Singapore, but the food was very good, packed full of flavour. The service was excellent and the waiter was friendly and informative, happy to talk, but understanding when to withdraw. He made a very good wine recommendation, which we very much enjoyed.The toilet facilities are those belonging to the Gallery and a bit of a hike from the dining room.Overall, although we enjoyed the meal and the outdoor terrace, had good service and were very grateful for not having to dine inside with all the noise (which wouldn't have been conducive to the romantic meal we were looking to have) I'm not sure we would rush back again
4
The food at Violet Oon is worth the wait- cooked home style, seemingly healthy, and with attentive service- although the couple of times we've been here, our order was forgotten once. Not a good place to conduct business though, as it gets very noisy, but if you don't get the limited sofa seats the chairs can at least help you stay alert after the sumptuous meal, as they are hard and wiry.Quite popular, one had to book in advance, and I can understand why- the food is the real big draw.
5
Make the reservation 2 weeks earlier and had dinner with family. good service, delicious asian food, and really not expensive. will go there again.
2
Had the high tea set and sadly most items are pretty cold! The sago kueh was even too tough to cut. Masala tea didn't have a masala taste to it.
4
Restaurant should consider improving the acoustics.
The noise level is too high to chat comfortably when the restaurant is almost full.
Perhaps adding more fabric like curtains/cushions/table cloth can help.
5
We started with drinks on the rooftop overlooking the city. The setting for this comfortable restaurant inside the National Gallery is amazing. You can do the museum, drinks on the rooftop and a wonderful dinner. The service was excellent and the food very authentic and delicious. Highly recommend.
3
Was there on a weekend for the high tea. The savory items were generally good but the sweet items were a bit of let down, especially the kesturi pie and kueh lapis sago which were quite bland despite the gula melaka. The dry laksa was good but a little too intense. Tea selection was quite sad with only 3 types... But do not order the chendol blend tea.Service was very average for an upmarket eatery like this. We were not served water for almost 10 minutes after we arrived despite the place not being busy at the time. There was also no one informing the patrons of last orders and we were surprised to be told at slightly after 4.30 pm that the kitchen was closed when we wanted to order more food.A bit overhyped based on our experience there
5
Had an enjoyable tea time with my mum to celebrate her birthday. Ordered the high-tea set for 2pax and the portion was just nice. Food was great but I wish there were more sweet than savory items as most peranakan savory dishes are spicy and may not be suitable for al
3
We were travelers and it was the first time for me and my family to visit this restaurant. Ive heard a lot about this restaurant and we were so excited about our visit. The environment and location are good, food quality is prefect too, but still need a lot of improvement on service.
3
We sat down at 7:05 and were asked by the vacate the table at 8:15 as another booking was waiting. There was no other booking but it was clear another group of 4 were not happy being seated at the Long table in the middle of the restaurant with strangers. We had not even been asked if we would line coffee or another drink. Such a pity as our waiter was very good. Would not return myself and would warn others to wear their Nike traiiners
4
Food combination is interesting. First time I had Rojak with guava. Nice touch. Tea selection is interesting too. The otak croustini I really like. The funny thing about the place is you have to pay for your lunch and tea separately. More of a nuisance than a real dissatisfaction. He bee hiam on toast is a nice touch too. Tends to be loud; especially couples with kids. What happened to the concept of ‚Äúinside voice‚Äù
3
peranakan cuisine at its best but for a few details which spoilt the culinary experience. The prawns in the mee Siam dish was not deveined and I did not fancy swallowing pooh tracks of prawns! Dishes completely overwhelmed by sauces and chillis and the essential balance of flavours was undermined. A real pity as a more subtle approach would hv made the dishes amazing. Manager Alex was very apologetic when told of uncleaned prawns. Staff attitude excellent and attentive. We were not charged for the mee siam dish and desserts were comped
4
The food quality is excellent, with a superb local flavour! Beware the food is spicy but what is Peranakan food without spice!
5
The service was very nice and professional with personal touch. The food was definitely delicious and I felt like eating the homemade dinner as the recipe was very authentic. The ambience made this restaurant very special with good lighting and decoration
4
food as usual was good . tried the dry mee siam - didn't think it was that good comparing to the laksa. the chicken rice rice itself was surprisingly tasty and yummy. however the place was full house during lunch and felt a bit squeezy for 7 to be in a table
5
Peranakan cuisine is unique to this region and can be found in Singapore, Malacca and Penang (traditional trading ports). National Kitchen is set in a beautiful location at the National Art Gallery. The decor is elegant with Nonya motifs. Food was up there with the best Peranakan offerings in Singapore: beef rendang was especially tender, the standard Ayam Buah Keluah was well executed with generous servings of the prizes Straits ‚Äúblack diamond‚Äù. I also liked the Chap Chye with cuttlefish ink - an interesting twist to the traditional blender chap chye dish. Service was impeccable especially the convivial operations manager, Seraj. All in all a wonderful place to experience unique heritage cuisine.
5
A magical spot on the Center part of Singapore Peninsula,,National Kitchen is truly a unique destination where you will experience splendour and pleasures of an unmistakeably PERANAKAN experience..Having plumped for an early morning flight from KLIA we touchdown at Changi International Airport at around 5pm,,and right way straight from the hotel our driver send us to the National Kitchen,,Were really been taken care of the wait staff Clover he really pampered us and fed us amazingly much to say this is a service that you won't find evryday,we were amaze by the place itself it is an elegant venue for every special occasions,,The starter Kuei pie Tee and 6 sticks of the chicken satay made our evening a way better than the decor of this place,,followed it by beef rendang,butter prawns and the Cod Fish in a creamy sauce with a drop of pesto,,if you feel the need to work off supper adjourn to this place,,Thank you for the wonderful experience Violet Oon.Thank you Violet Oon for this wonderful evening,

I had been looking forward to my first visit here as it came highly recommended. The feel is stylish Parisian jewelbox, all black lacquer and gold highlights, large mirrors and chandeliers. The smallness also makes it a little cramped and noisy to be honest. The food was super. We liked our starter (one portion big enough for two) and the beef and snapper mains were on the spicy side but delicious, as were the desserts.But the service was so rushed and chaotic as to sour the experience. We ate at around 8:30, late enough that there wouldn't be another sitting after us, but the waiters acted like they were trying to rush us through like a pre-theatre menu, or so they could go home. We ordered cocktails to begin the meal, and two glasses of wine intending to have them with main. The food arrived within a few minutes of ordering (so obviously pre-prepared), main followed by starter. But this is Asia, so you might expect everything together, fair enough. We deliberately ate slowly while we waited for our drinks. The cocktails arrived half way through our slow eating, with the wine three-quarters of the way through the meal with most of it eaten, and only after reminding the waiter that we hadn't ordered dessert wine!If the barman is busy, please use your initiative and hold bringing the food as there was no rush, or ask us whether we would like the drinks first, and bring the food accordingly. We are not there to fit around the automaton-like decisionless waiters. A place of this standard should train waiters to think for themselves and fit around the clients, not the other way around.And one last strange thing. The waiters kept taking unused cutlery from our table to use on others. Surely unhygienic?! How do they know we haven't coughed or sneezed over them, or used them and put them back
4
It was located at a great location and the National Kitchen definitely fit in perfectly with the National gallery though i was hoping for a more Peranakan design rather than 80% Classic European design. Nonetheless, it was nice ambience.The service was ok. Food was a little overpriced. Simple tauhu Goreng ( with just tauhu and beanspout and cucumber) cost $9. the Tauhu was a little too dry though the sauce was really fantastic. Surprisingly, the tumeric chicken wings were really good and the chinchalok sambal was so refreshing that my friend and I almost finished the chilli sauce. Lastly, the $18 chicken rice was a little over priced though the chicken was really good but the rice was a little too oily. However the chicken rice chilli sauce was yummy delicious. Unfortunately, my friend from overseas whom I dine in with, commented that she would prefer hawker food those food that we have eaten from the restaurant
5
Everything was good, ambience was good for attending oversea guest. Except the place is abit small.Food was excellent, Fish head curry was fresh and superb and we didn't expect such places can cook up perfect chicken rice with great texture. Beef redang was soft and melted in the mouth and Dry Laksa also taste perfectly well. Dessert was beyond our praises.We also appreciate the great services and the attention given to us.If only, our plates can changed more frequently, that will be even better.Our guest enjoyed very much and leave them a good impression of Singapore food
5
This was the scene of my ‚ÄúWelcome to Singapore‚Äù dinner, hosted by three of my Singaporean mates. And quite frankly they couldn‚Äôt have chosen better if they‚Äôd tried!Food was awesome but truly it was the service that was the standout. There wait staff:table ratio was extremely high, and we wanted for nothing.This was such an impressive experience in a city-state known for impressive culinary experiences. Well done folks

Singapore has a very wide variety of Chinese restaurants, many Indian, plus all kinds of international cuisine. The choice is often bewildering, but if you want something local, but different, rather than Teo Chew, Hokkien, or Hakka dishes (all very good, and widely available) try Peranakan food: melded from Chinese and Malay styles, and unique to the region. Violet Oon's National Kitchen is a good place to sample it. Set in the converted historic City Hall (worth a visit in its own right - so do arrive half an hour early) the restaurant is busy, so be sure to make a reservation.The dishes are classic, and I doubt that any would disappoint. Our Ngoh Hiang (minced prawn and chicken in a thin beancurd skin) and Kuay Pie Tee (shredded bamboo shoot and turnip in pastry cases) starters were excellent, as were the buah kelauak ayam and beef rendang (beef braised in a a spicy, but not chilli-hot sauce) mains. The BKA is made with a large nut that I haven't come across elsewhere than in Peranakan food, and adds a very special flavour to the dish. We simply didn't have room for desserts!The service was pleasant and efficient, and the decor interesting - if on the dark side. If you are looking for a quiet meal, it's not the place to be: the hard furnishings and lack of anything to soften the sounds, makes the room rather noisy
5
Really enjoyed all of the dishes we tried including the desert.
Only negative was the very loud juicer in the bar.
5
I visited with business colleagues for a lunch. I loved the style of the restaurant (dark walls, old photos) and the Peranakan food on offer. Best dishes for me were the beef rendang and the black rice pudding with coconut ice cream. Service was excellent.
5
Food amazingly delicious, portion was just perfect for 2-3 pax. The design and renovation was beautifully done, not what you would expect from Peranakan restaurant. Price is on the premium side. The Ngo Hiang & Beef Rendang is must try. Staff were friendly and polite.
4
Food portions ideal for 3-4 pax party. If more pax, will have to order double of each dish. Good place to bring foreign friends to experience peranakan food as comfortable setting.
4
My friend and i went on a weekday. Therefore the place is quite quiet. We went for tea and I think the tea set is not bad. Just nice for 2. The chendol tea was unique. My friend had coffee and she said the coffee tasted really good. Im not sure if the staff's name is really Clover, he's really helpful and made sure that we were well taken care of. Good photography skills too! I'll definitely return to this place for te
4
We arrive at tea time and got the SINGAPORE HIGH TEA$56 ++ per set (for 2 pax):Food: simple and delicious. few of them were not masterly prepared.Tea: obviously perfect.Service: not bad, but not good either. kind of doesn't care too much.Ambiance: full, lively and somewhat royal.In sum, good experience.MAY YOUR RICE BOWLALWAYS BE FULL.√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù V.
3
Heard so much about it. Finally went. It was an important date. Staffs was very helpful n understanding. Just got turn off by the small table n chairs. Yes I agree it's peranakan but why only the chairs n table when the other decor was black n gold... it's not an acceptable reasoning
5
The food of The National Kitchen is great, nice ambience and good service. The wine list is very limited but the Sauvignon blanc they have is very good. We were lucky to reserve a table for the same day at 9pm. However, service was ok but not extraordinary (wine service we did on our own / cleaning of the table took too long after 10 min.). This is maybe as we were the last table who was seated and the staff was not too much attentive anymore. But definitely a must go to while visiting Singapore!!!
5
National Kitchen was recommended by a local friend for the best Peranakan food and this restaurant lived up the expectations. The bartender was super friendly and interested in learning about my personal experiences. Also was very helpful in explaining the local history. The food was easily explained to me and got a great meal. the Satay was wonderful! Be careful though, when they say spicy, it will be VERY spicy. Would return the next time I am in town, the service could not be beat. Prices reasonable for Singapore
5
if you like local peranakan food, this is right place for you. i like the food, last my visit i try their sambal udang,nasi lemak,ngoh hiang,satay,COD fish laksa sauce and its all nice. unfortunatelly we order too much dish so i cant try their dessert.next sure will try their dessert and their local high tea set. just to inform if u like to come to this resto,better do reservation via chope 2 weeks before so u can get space.About the place,their restaurant not so big,but always full, eventhought full , i like the atmosphere
4
Sat at bar and barmen very helpful, chose traditional foods. Never had black nuts before and mixed in with the sauce was delicious.
There was a slight mix up with my order, but otherwise very good food and service
5
WOW what a fantastic meal, the service was impeccable and knowledgeable and the food was simply superb. As for the location and ambience, need I say anything more - what an excellent all round package
4
Interior of restaurant is amazing if you are looking for ambience. Food is great, I recommend the Assam Fish and Ngoh Hiang serving was a bang for the buck. However you need to reserve a table in advance, 2 weeks at least.
5
The venue at the National Kitchen is on the smaller side but it is a great atmosphere and the food and service are second to none.
4
The ambiance at the restaurant was awesome and a very good place to visit if you are craving for Peranakan food.
5
Good food, nice ambiance, great service, good song
If you want to impress for guest, or celebrate your friend bday. This is a right place to go !
5
Great food and ambience. Fish head currry is my Favourite and the beef randang. Very nice service and staff.
5
the quality of food is very good, spicy level is adjusted compared with my previous visit so it's easier for tourists but not disappointing the locals. The Hainanese Chicken Rice is surprisingly good, Il say the best in town. The price is reasonable giving the quality, the service and the ambiance. Must try!
5
We felt transported back to the days of colonial Singapore in the restaurant with the interior design. The food and service was on point. Great for birthday celebration. The service was attentive. Great food at a very reasonable price for the ambience. I highly recommend the place.
4
Shaky start when we arrived and our table wasn't ready. We were sat in the rather spartan terrace and waited a very long time for our drinks. This was redeemed by the sufficiently apologetic staff who quickly tried to make amends. Our annoyance earlier quickly evaporated when the food arrived - it was simply delicious. Well done, we will be back
4
On level 2 of tbe Singapore National Gallery tbe place is very cosy i the spirit of tbe Supreme Court architecture. Food is great and service very pleasant. Definitely a nice place to have some rest after visiting (or not) the museum.
5
We had a very delicious Dinner with impeccable Service. The location is super nice.
The waiter took good care of us and had the best recommendations.
5
What a treat. Great service,great food and loved the decor. Shared a selection of starters followed by individual mains, The food was inventive take on the traditional. Would reccomendation this to anyone for a special occasion.
5
Had expected to be underwhelmed by this much hyped restaurant On the contrary, found the food very good especially the pie tie, beef rendang, chili prawns & sayor lodeh(vegetables in coconut curry). Service was friendly & prompt. Prices are reasonable, & dinner for 2 excluding wine would cost up to $150.Found the interiors a little fussy & bright; & spaces between tables tightOtherwise a highly satisfying dinner. One advice is it's not so easy catching taxis from the National Galler
5
Ok - you've won me over. There is something a little daunting about visiting a restaurant called "the national kitchen" - I can only image the pressure of living up to that moniker. On both occasions - we have been warmly greeted at the door, completely efficient - but with a genuine warmth. The team will walk you through the menu, and as they bring items to the table will explain what it is etc. We ordered the randang - and it was delicious. Warming and succulently tender, real depth of complex flavours that make you want more. Just resist as there are many other items to try and enjoy - but unlesss you know an obliging grandma or aunt that's willing to cook for you, I don't, so I'll always be back for the randang. Chicken wingsSambal eggplant Nonya acharThe list goes on....Last but not least, in Singapore - where service is.... to be honest, not great. The national kitchen is good by any standard in the world, and fantastic in Singapore. Top marks for genuine interest in your customers
2
Food was just average n the table we wanted was reserved for the owner! N the owner didn't quite stay very Long and didn't eat. Guess that is what the owner's rights are. Acoustics in the restaurant was very poor. Service is decent but overall was underwhelming.
5
visit here on a friday evening,we received a warm welcome from the entrance and served by this wonderful waiter that always give us a wonderful smile,,my dad is a peranakan food lover and he really loved this place so much and on our 3rd visit here service and food exceeded our expectations,,,well recommend this place to all my colleagues,,thank you for a lovely dinner National Kitchen:-
5
My friends really enjoyed ourselves,,it was a wonderful lovely lunch we have,the food was so tasty recommended by this guy they call rosel and the service we received from him was excellent and all those dishes that we have made our reunion so wonderful,,Tau hu goreng..Ngoh hiang..Satay.Beef Cheek--out of this worldBuah Kuluak AyamButter prawnsCod fish-Amazingggggg.The veggies are also a perfect match with all the mains that we have..Thank you for the wonderful experience Violet Oon,,will definitely be back.
4
My first impression of this restaurant was ...very impressive and well designed decor but was a bit disappointed when I entered because it was so small and cramp.However this was quickly taken away by the service they offered. Excellent service!!! The food is a bit salty for my personal taste and price is quite reasonable.
5
This beautiful restaurant is housed with in the National Gallery and is a real joy. We booked for a Sunday lunch. It is wise to book for lunch on the week end as it is very well patronised.The service is attentive, friendly and prompt. The d√É¬©cor is lovely, contributing to the feeling that eating here is a special event, as does the fine monogramed china.The food is tasty Peranekan fare. we went for Gado Gado, Chap Chye and Dry Laksa washed down with a glass of sparkling. For two people this was plenty and we disappointingly had no room for desert..A little expensive perhaps but a wonderful treat. we recommend i
5
Second visit and still very enjoyable. Recommended dishes - beef rendang, ngoh hiang, kueh pie tee. Service was excellent without being intrusive.
5
Came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner, booked in advance and the staff offered us dessert on the house which was really lovely. The cod was delicious, would reorder. Overall, it was a really great experience.
4
We were invited by family to have dinner there and it was a fantastic meal. Service was excellent, and the servers were friendly even though they were a little rushed.The appetisers were great and the portions were large. We enjoyed the pie tee, and especially the rojak, which was nicely tart, sweet and slightly sour all at the same time. The satay was not bad, though the minced meat skewers were compressed a tad too tight. The soup was tasty, while the ngoh hiang could have been more flavourful.The mains were on the more expensive side. A portion of beef rendang consisted of four small pieces, though the rempah was fab. I would have preferred the meat to have a bit more chewiness to it. The chicken buak kelak was also nice.The cost for seven people, excluding drinks, was @$280. They have two sessions, from 615 to 815pm, and from 830 pm. They have a rather cute banquet table for two near the bar at the end
3
We arrived and we're greeted and placed on a lovely table. The ambience of this restaurant is very grand and you feel special being there. Our waiter was very pleasant and went through the menu. We ordered the satay stick and coronation chicken cups for staters but unfortunately they had run out of the satay. So we opted for the chicken wings. Both dishes were amazing in flavour and presentation. For mains we ordered the beef tending which was by far the best I had ever had! It was tender and melted in your mouth and the gravy was rich with aromatic flavours and amazing. Definitely the star dish for the night. Unfortunately my husband ordered the Buah keluak noodle dish which had a very distinct taste to it which he did not enjoy at all. We told the waiter that he did not enjoy his meal as they could see he left most of it on the plate and at the beef. All the waiters came over one by one and asked how our meals were however not one decided to offer us an alternative or a complimentary dessert! We didn't expect to receive it for free however they could have offered my husband a complimentary dessert. The waiters kept on agreeing that the meal choice was very unique in flavour but they never really said that from the start. They only said it was spicy! Anyway overall a nice dining experience and would recommend you order dishes that you are familiar with

Called on Friday morning to book a table for the dinner. The staff that answered the phone replied that all 3 restaurants were full. And she will put me on waiting list, and promised to call me back before 6pm. There was no call return till 7pm. When I called to check, the staff just simply said no table for me. I m fine with this.On Saturday afternoon I received a call from Violet Oon Singapore staff said that I have called to reserve a table for Saturday nite dinner. What is this!!!
4
This was our second visit to the National Kitchen and we took friends from Melbourne who hadn't been before. It was disappointing to find they'd run out of Idly although we were booked in at 1pm. The chutneys are divine that go with it and they had run out of those too. We had the satay which was excellent, the beef rendang and the cod in laksa sauce - both good. It's a great location to have Peranakan food. I love all the old tiles that adorn the ceiling, walls and floors
5
My friends and u thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It was our first time at a Violet Oon restaurant and it's definitely not going to be our last. The food was so tasty. We loved the dry last so much that we ordered it twice. The service we received from a staff member (Senior malay gentleman) was excellent. I would like to commend on his customer service skills and also thank the restaurant for making my friend's birthday a memorable one.
5
Wow! Wow! Wow! Amazing experience from the door to table. Walked in for lunch after the gallery yesterday, unfortunately they were full, your guest relations was quick to improvise and offered us the bar if we didn't mind. That was the best decision we made. Bar manager was a joy to talk to, recommended us a few dishes. The ayam buah keluak was amazing, so was the melt in your mouth beef rendang. Probably the best Peranakan food i've had outside of home. The house pour red was surprisingly good too! Your restaurant manager came to ask how's our lunch coming along? Introduced us to your off the menu kopi peng shaken cocktail style, the fragrance of the coffee was amazing topped with a nice creamy head like a guinness. Then we asked whats in the jar behind the bar that says chendol tea? He offered us a wiff, OMG! olfactory heaven! Lunch was definitely above and beyond my expectations, thank you for the wonderful experience for all 5 senses, will definitely be back ;

We visited the restaurant tonite and the experience was far from what we expected. The place is small - and that's ok - but the bartenders were the worst ever. Pushing us to decide on food, pouring wine in our (untouched) full glasses and bringing main course while appetizers were still uneaten (they asked if they can remove our appetizers - mostly unfinished - because main dish is done????). Honestly it seems like a tourist trap where everything goes but for this price Singapore can offer better. Up to you to decide, hope you have a better experience.

Wow! This place setting was fabulous. It felt very classy. We went at 2pm for a walk-in on a Monday. Glad they had room for us. Food was great. Except the manager didn't like us talking to aFellow countryman, even if we just asked what we should order... besides that, Rojak salad was (good way) different, beef rendang was still best. And coffee!!! We had a rice Pudding with coconut milk. Just order and try everything that you like

Most definitely a must of your are visiting Singapore.
Amazing flavours. Fusion of Malay and Singaporean cuisine. This place is a stop every time I visit Singapore.
5
Perfect interior setting and service rendered by the excellent crew. The high tea set was served with both savoury and sweet delicacies we had a great time at the restaurant!
5
Price is affordable for the quality of food. Will definitely recommend this place to my tourist friends.
5
The service is really good. My visitors totally enjoy it. The food is so so for our taste, a bit too flavourful.
5
I love afternoon tea. So I was curious and excited to experience National Kitchen's afternoon tea. The sets are better enjoyed by two people. You can choose from three teas, one of which is chendol with a coconut flavor. The appetizers, mains and desserts are all Peranakan flavors, some of which are spicy to differing degrees, and you can also add on an order of laksa for two. The wait staff are knowledgeable and friendly as they answer questions and explain the food. We left very happy and really full

Have visited Violet Oon at Bukit Timah (twice) and National Gallery (three times) over the last couple of years. Slightly prefer National Gallery. Both have excellent atmosphere, outstanding service, and serve very good food. Best to go as a group of at least 4. Serves Peranakan food which is very well price

We go to Violet Oon National Gallery every time we visit Singapore as the food and setting are great. This restaurant limits you to 2 sittings and this time we booked the later 8.30 one. Their website informs you of the sitting times and that the early sitting may be asked to finish dining by 8pm in order to prepare tables for the second sitting. We confirmed our booking by email after the initial booking. Our flight was delayed/late into Singapore and our taxi dropped us at 8.32 at the National Gallery entrance, we arrived up at the restaurant at 8.40. We were told with routine apology a table was not available and to wait in the foyer. We asked to sit at the bar so we could have a drink until a table was available and we were eventually seated at a table just after 9pm. Now I just don't understand why a table was not ready for us given they operate on the sittings premise. Did they give our second sitting table away as we were 10 minutes late or did they take too many walk ins. Whatever the reason if I book in advance for the 8.30 sitting I would expect to actually have a table when I arrive. If it was a restaurant where there are tables booked for various time slots I can understand why a table may not be ready on time as expected, however if you are clearly advertising 2 sittings then the table should be ready for the second. To add to this people who came in after us had their food orders taken before us. We were seated just after 9 then around 9.50 while we were still eating our mains the waiter asked us to place any dessert orders as the kitchen closed at 10 pm! The food is great here, but the 2 sittings system sucks. I won't return to pay a premium for one hours worth of dining no matter how good the food.

I was very disappointed with the service. There was some misunderstanding and the reservation could not take place in the private room. I have requested for this to be changed many times, but despite this we arrived for the afternoon tea at 3pm and the room wasn't ready for us. Not just that, but the other table in the main room was also not available and my guests had to wait standing for quite a while - even though this reservation was made a month earlier! We didn't feel welcome and had to discuss for a while in front of my guests the table situation with the lady by the entry. Note that we have spent WAY more than the minimum required for the use of the private room - as advised that we would! So I'm very frustrated in general with the service and how my event was handled. Beautiful place but would not recommend it!

Though I am loath to call a halal restaurant 'Peranakan', The National Kitchen by Violet Oon does justice to our local cuisine in a beautiful room coupled with excellent service. I just wish something could be done about the noise levels. You can't help but hear the conversations of fellow diners while you whisper at your table as the sound bounces and travels in the room
5
Took my mum here for her birthday lunch and I have to say service was impeccable. The staff surprised my mum with a cake, sang a birthday song for her and printed a bday photo for us to keep. Food was also good. Anyone planning to celebrate a birthday there can just let them know. They may just spring you a surprise cake too. Great great experience
4
Food (love the beef rendang, dry laksa, tapioca cake) and service was awesome but the noise level ruined the atmosphere.
5
Server went above and beyond to make our anniversary celebrations perfect. Kudos! Good food as well.
5
We stopped in to National Kitchen, unplanned (usually I research carefully), for afternoon tea. I have food intolerances so it ruled out the delicious-looking high tea but the lovely staff were well informed and educated about what was in each dish and helped me choose the Rojak with everything on the side and a heavenly pot of tea they recommended.The cafe itself is a gorgeous setting, the food was delicious and the service was excellent. Making room for my wheelchair was low fuss, in fact the whole building is very accessible. Thank you for looking after us
4
Lovely little intimate restaurant on the second story of the National Gallery. Black and white tile floors, Peranakan-tiled walls, embroidered silks on the ceiling, and white marble table tops combine for a unique bistro vibe. Great Beef Rendang and Coronation Chicken. Be advised the Udang Goreng Prawns are five alarm hot. Reservations definitely recommended. One small nit: Tables should be a bit larger to better accommodate family-style presentation of the dishes
3
Have always been a fan of Violet Oon's, having dined at her other outlets. I decided to have dinner at The National Kitchen to celebrate my husband's birthday on a Saturday evening. The decor of the place was beautiful and the food, as expected, was very good: we loved the laksa Spaghetti, beef rendang, duck soup and the Toufu. If I may provide my personal feedback: I wished the team would look into improving the service standards to make it more consistent across every team member. Service was ok but impersonal and lacks attention - our request for drinks was forgotten twice. Also when we we leaving the restaurant, we walked by the service team who were standing at entrance and practically felt invisible - no thank yous, no goodbyes l. There were some younger staff who were friendly and puts in the effort, and have opportunities to be more on point. It was a pity - the food and the decor definitely deserved better!
4
While in Singapore, I caught up with a colleague for lunch.He booked us into Violet Oon's National Kitchen at the National Gallery.It was small and intimate, yet the food packed a real sense of local style, history and flavour.We shared a dish of noodles with lightly spiced prawns and a dish of a strange dark root almost nut which is poisonous until soaked in water and cooked.It turns out a sweet yet intense dark paste that mixed with n oodles and a hint of chilli was delicious.Service was a little slow during the lunch rush, but the food more than made up for it
4
We popped in for high tea and we were delighted. The selection was quite different to other high teas I have experienced. The service was professional although somewhat impersonal. The ambience was lovely and the sweet sounds of Madeleine Peyroux playing in the back ground topped off a lovely experience
3
Will not be my first as the interior decor captivated me! However it was started , unexpectedly not smooth from ordering , serving n re-ordering. I guess is not my day but there were 2 staff apologetic n compensated w 2 free dishes. 1 Malay male senior forgotten my order but when reminded he did not recognize his negligent instead he defensive the drink already on the way which I have reminded the staff to order for me again.
5
First time here and the ambience is great, just like the Bukit Timah outlet. Peranakan food here is tasty and not too spicy even though I would have preferred that it was a little more spicy. Had the kiam chye ark thbg, gado gado, cod in creamy laksa sauce, garam Assam fish, sambal eggplant and chicken rice rice. All were really good but seriously the desserts are the ones that are always mind-blowing, we had roti jala and Kueh dah dah but seriously anything off the dessert menu is awesome!
5
Menu have good selection of Peranakan fare. Like beef rendang, the type that melt in your mouth meat. Kueh pie tee as a starter. We also ordered, Assam Fish. Now being a Peranakan myself, I have a high expectation that it should taste like the one in Malacca as only a Bibi & Nonya can cook. well they make it just right. We did not order dessert as we ordered more of main dishes and side dishes and were too full to try the desserts. Service wise the wait staff are friendly and efficient, and friendly enough as if you are entering their homes and being welcome and well fed
5
Love this place with good food and good service. Booking is recommended. We had a lovely tea set and delicious dry curry laksa
4
Try the beef rendang and dry laksa. Place has become abit noisier since my last visit in 2016, but a nice ambience all around. Prices are of course higher than usual, but a given for the frills and location.
4
we had kueh pie tee, sambal eggplant and cod fillet. all dishes were well prepared and flavourful. service staff were very attentive and professional.
downside was that the place was noisy so it was difficult to have a conversation
5
Excellent service from a profession team at National Kitchen.
Good food and value makes it a must visit each time but it is every team member at NK which makes all the difference.
4
Nice peranakan food with great ambience. However price is rather steep for its portion. Recommend to go!
4
Great ambience for this outlier is located in the Singapore national gallery. The food is ok. My second visit. Strangely I recalled the first visit was much better and I personally even had a photograph taken with he distinguished Violet herself. Maybe that's the reason i.e. The chef being present. Regardless worthy of a visit. Service is ok. Food is ok. Ambience great. So why not!
4
petai lovers: Recommend the petai with prawns dish. There is the generous portion of the petai and they are of good size too. There is a fair bit of choices, so good to have a group. Overall, do enjoy the decor and ambience although it was a bit noisy with the crowds.
4
The overall experience was a pleasant one. Food was good and servers were attentive. The only downside was we felt a little rushed as servers came to our tables multiple times in a very span of time asking if they could clear our tables and each time we had to explain we were not done, still waiting for the next dish to be served

I went to The National Kitchen by Violet Oon at the Singapore National Gallery recently. Violet Oon is a local celebrity chef, food critic and restaurateur. We were fortunate we made a reservation as it was very busy and without a reservation you had to wait for an available table. This restaurant is an upscale fusion Peranakan restaurant. The Peranakan are Straits born Chinese that have a unique cultural heritage. Traditionally, they are Straits Chinese men that have married Malay women. They speak a mix of Chinese and Malay. Their dress is Malay and their food is an incorporation of Chinese and Malay ingredients and cooking styles...exquisite!Our service that day was excellent. The wait staff were attentive and polite. The food was very good. It was upmarket Peranakan. We started out with a traditional Peranakan dish called Kueh Pie Tee. They are little deep fried "baskets" filled with cooked jicama and shrimp and come with a sweet sauce and chilli sauce that you drizzle over your basket. Delicious!We also had Ayam Buah Keluak. This is a chicken dish in a rich thick aromatic gravy and these nuts called Buah Keluak which give a slightly bitter and nutty flavour. The dry laksa was excellent. Laksa is traditionally a seafood noodle dish in a rich curried coconut soup. The dry laksa didn't have the soup but still had all the flavour of the curried coconut. We also had an exquisite deep fried chilli prawn dish topped with fried shallots and chilies. The jicama salad had a lovely umami flavour and was just right with the heavier dishes. We also tried the sayoh lodeh which is braised cabbage and green beans in a lightly spiced coconut gravy. A perfect dish, along with the ayam Buah Keluak, to steamed rice. For dessert we had a selection of Nonya (the name given Peranakan women) Kuehs. "Kueh" is the Malay word for cakes. We tried the Kueh da da (a pandan or screw pine leaf infused light crepe with a fresh shredded coconut and palm sugar filling) and Kueh Ban Kang (a rice and tapioca flour cake with coconut and palm sugar mixed into the flour mixture and steamed. This was served with coconut cream). They were both delicious!As you can tell, Peranakan food isn't Weight Watchers but it sure is delectable. All this deliciousness came with a heftier price tag but it was good for a treat. I wouldn't be able to eat here on a regular basis. The restaurant decor was Parisian Bistro style with jazz music playing in the background. All in all a pleasant experience in a pleasant setting. I would recommend it for an indulgence.

Located on the 2nd floor of National Gallery Singapore, National Kitchen by Violet Oon was packed on a weekend for lunch.Tried the following dishes:[APPETIZERS]Tau Hu Goreng ($9++)Kuay Pie Tee ($17++)[MEATS]Buah Keluak Ayam ($23++)Beef Rendang ($23++)[VEGGIES]Sayur Lodeh ($13++)Chap Chye ($15++)[NOODLES/RICE]Dry Laksa ($22++)Jasmine Rice ($1++)[DESSERTS]Kueh Beng Kah ($9++)Pineapple Upside Down Cake ($12++)The portions here are small, but super delicious, so the Bui Bui in me does not mind. Efficient & friendly service, & I love the ambiance & decor too. My favourite dishes are a toss-up between Buah Keluak Ayam, Beef Rendang, & Sayur Lodeh. I cannot choose. YOU CANNOT MAKE ME CHOOSE, I will want to eat all with a nice bowl of rice so I can maximize all the zhup.Desserts weren't particularly special, just stick to the mains if you have limited stomach space. Then again, portions are small, .... ... Up to you lah. Accepts credit cardsÔ∏è Air conditioned seats only Accepts reservations - I used Chope WiFi available (National Gallery
5
I've visited this restaurant a few times and it has always been exceptional. Beautiful setting/decor, delicious food, and top-notch service.
5
really enjoyed the food at national kitchen, sayur lodeh was my personal favorite, friends loved the beef rendang and ayam buah keluak
5
Lovely spot with exceptional decor and the nicest staff we've had in Singapore. Highly recommended!!
3
The food was really just average and they didn't have lots of choices like other peranakan restaurants. I wouldn't go there ago if not for the nice interior decor.
5
Was our first time there for my Mom's birthday and was blown away by the scrumptious food and ambience. The must-tries for desserts would be the tapioca cake and burbur hitam coconut ice cream. Made a note that we were celebrating my Mom's birthday and that it would be nice for her to have something special, but I think the restaurant missed it. Good food, nonetheless but a special personal touch would have made the overall experience a great one
5
Always enjoy bringing friends visiting from overseas - ambience is great, food was delicious, wait staff very humorous and attentive. Only problem was music was rather loud but wait staff told us sound was centralized and couldn't be turned down which was rather perplexing. Had a great bonus as we were there on a sat evening and had s great view of the NDP preview fireworks from the restaurant!
5
My wife and I had dinner here with my sister and brother in law while visiting Singapore and were very impressed. The decor creates a real sense of occasion, capturing an opulent but tasteful style with lots of dark wood and tiles. Our waiter was great, highlighting the best dishes and advising us to share plates which we did for each course. Standout dishes included the beef rendang, coronation chicken, tapioca cake and black rice pudding. All the mains were good and we were pleasantly surprised by the desserts which were excellent. In fact the only downside was the limited and expensive wine list, not unusual in Singapore. A great meal to enjoy genuine Singaporean/Malaysian cuisine of the highest quality and a wonderful dining experience
4
I was there with some friends for high tea. There were 5 of us, so we ordered 2 high-tea sets to share. starters were excellent but the pulled beef pau was too spicy for us. The har bee hiem sandwich was a tad oily too. It might look like finger food but is actually quite filling as desserts were mainly coconut and glutinous rice.Reservations are recommended as they fill up quite fast. Restaurant decor, setup and ambience is nice but the booth-style table we were seated was abit cramp
3
Decor superb, food high quality, drinks overpriced, my very weak gin and tonic was $18++. They had warned us that noise levels would be high because of a large group booking. The noise was tolerable, but the 3 of us didn't expect to be squeezed into a corner table meant for two. This meant that my chair was repeatedly jostled by passing waiters and guests.The very tall maitre d' and the waiter who served us were excellent but not the lady who took the orders. She hurried us along and the satay starter was served with the main course dishes
4
Please make reservations before you visit as the restaurant's always fully booked. We went for the high-tea, interesting assortment of local delights with Peranakan twist. However, the sweet series are full of coconut and glutinous rice, so it's actually very filling even for 2 pax. Luckily there're 4 of us, so we ordered 1 set of high tea for 2 and then a la carte with Kuah Pie Tee (Yes), Chilli Mantou (too sweet), Coronation Chicken in Wantan Leaf cup (ok) and Pulot Hitam with coconut ice-cream (Yes). Yum.
4
Tasty peranakan food but portions are small and pricey. Nice ambience
Should allow customers to dictate spiciness of food but toned down due to expatriate customers
4
Love the food as usual. The beef cheek is amazing! Soft and tender. The flavour of the curry and spice were perfectly matched.
5
This was our first meal in town and considering we had a little one with us during dinner after a long flight they were very accomodating! The food was just amazing, we had two portions of the prawns.
4
Top marks for d√©cor. It's not a big restaurant in terms of seating but its d√©cor befits the category of fine-dining. Prices are a tad higher than most restaurants that serve similar cuisine but then, you're are dining inside a historic landmark building. I had made an online reservation way in advance after two previously failed attempts to get a table. The overall dining experience was good. We had Ngoh Hiang, Sambal Petai with Prawns, Buah Keluak Ayam and Chicken & Prawn Bostador. The serving size was good for two if not three. The Ngoh Hiang was a good appetizer. My partner liked the Sambal Petai as I did with the Bostador. We are fans of Buah Keulak but were a bit disappointed with their version. We would have preferred a thicker gravy. The chicken was a bit tough too. But we enjoyed the nuts as the fillings were smooth and tasty. We wanted some room for supper later so we decided to skip dessert and asked for the bill. We were pleasantly surprised when the waiter changed our cutlery and brought us a Kueh Beng Kah topped with a candle. I vaguely remember if I indicated in my reservation it was a dinner treat for my partner's birthday. The cake was warm and moist with a generous serving of coconut cream. A really good ending to a wonderful meal
3
Impressive elegant and chic decor. Restaurant is small hence booking was more than one week in advance. Rather noisy. Dry meesiam overpowered by too much paste, spicy and salty, saved by generous big prawns; same for dry laksa. Rojak was good but would taste better mixed with sliced strips of ginger flower than garnish. Kuen pie tee was average. Eight pieces was too many. Again, Generous with prawns. Best dish was garam Assam fish, excellent, but too little gravy to mix with rice. Service staff was prompt, attentive. Would be good to have two size servings. Would return again to try other dishes.
5
This restaurant is so charming homey and beautiful inside the National Gallery. The staff were so professional, courteous and delivered 5 star service. The food was Pernakan and my favorite was one of their best sellers, a fried meat roll served with a dipping sauce of honey. Beef Rendang and coconut rice was superb, the chicken wings, prawns & everything we ordered was delicious! The calamansi soda was so refreshing! I loved the wonderful lunch
5
Dishes in this restaurant is something special. We can eat Checken rice, Chap Chye and Nyonya queh in coffee shop or hawker centre. However these local traditional dishes in this restaurant are clealy different from and much tastier than those in coffee shop or hawker centre
5
The National Kitchen by Violet Oon is a must for anyone who is serious about sampling the authentic cuisine of Singapore. It requires a booking but if you do take a chance & just turn up , the staff will do all they can to accommodate you. The food is exquisite & the service is excellent. We were dining with a 3 year old & our waiter went out of his way to include my grandson in all his interactions with us. The setting is beautiful, we sat outside on the balcony & the view is an added bonus. Singaporeans are justly proud of the reputation Violet has acquired.....do yourselves a huge favor!
4
The National Gallery is a beautiful location and the restaraunt is very elegantly appointed. The room is quite small so it is best suited to small groups and the menu is more suited to sharing dishes. The food is tasty and comes with a few surprises. The meatless meatballs are a must try! The service was on point. You need to book ahead as it is very popular and only has about 60 seats
5
The 60 seater Restaurant is booked up to 2 weeks in advance.As a visitor with 2 grown up adult children swinging by without a booking, we were pleased that there were 3 corner seats near the bar counter that was available for us for dinner.The atmosphere was welcoming with the Restaurant Manager Yogi and Bartender Paul chatting with us and making us feel at home.The excellent service is an important complement to the excellent food.In fact my son had lunch there and asked us to also have dinner there the very same day before he flies out in two days' time.This is a testament of how tasty the food is.He enjoyed the sambal eggplant, the fish and sayur lodeh.I really enjoyed the dessert - Kueh Dadar - a greenish pancake stuffed with grated coconut soaked in top quality gula melaka (liquid palm sugar).I haven't tasted anything like this when I was living in Singapore
5
I could not think of a more beautiful setting to sample some of Singapore's quintessential dishes. Service was impeccable from all, but special thanks to Ruel (sp?) for taking such great care of us. Terima kasih And maraming salamat!
3
I had important visitors from Europe and was given the most lousy table in the room! : ( It was small and right next to the entrance. There was not enough room to place the many dishes we ordered. Total embarrassment!
4
While the servings were quite small, the taste of the food was outstanding. Must try the beef rendang! Meat was so tender. Servive was attentive and friendly. Will come back.
5
Lunch was heavenly with Beef randang, Coronation chicken, prawns and local crepe. Service from Paul at the bar was excellent- friendly and helpful. The lunch and visit to the exhibition was a highlight of our Singapore visit.
5
This was my second time to National Kitchen at this location and it didn't disappoint. The food is lovely, the service is very good and the general ambience of the restaurant is very pleasant. Would highly recommend.
5
That's right, I went there for lunch and even made it to the high tea menu. I was impressed with the food so much so that I took my family here for dinner the same day to try other things on the menu. However I think the highlight was having the most outstanding and friendly service from Paul and Yogi. They make you feel very comfortable, can recommend the best dishes, was very professional yet super friendly and we even had many good conversations!Decor of the restaurant was striking and detailed. The ambience was very pleasant.The food overall was an excellent Peranakan experience. Below is what I had over the day:- Singapore Iced Tea was nice and refreshing and a great non-alcoholic option. - Buah Keluak Ayam was yummy. Chicken was very tender. - Sambal Eggplant was my favourite dish! The eggplants were absolutely delicious.- Garam Assam Fish was also very very good. It was boneless fillets of mackerel in the tastiest Assam sauce - Kueh Dah Dah was amazing. Coconut drenched in gula Melaka on the inside and thin smooth pandan crepe outside - Roti Jala also very good- Coconut ice cream with gula Melaka - Cod in creamy laksa sauce was another highlight/favourite. The Cod was actually cooked to perfection and the Cod itself was full of flavour then more flavour added with the laksa sauce. Beware it's a smaller portion though but totally worth the try!- Sayur Lodeh was good-Kueh Beng Kah (not pictured) also very lovelyHere's the order in which I would rank the main dishes from best to good:1. Cod in Laksa2. Sambal Eggplant3. Garam Assam Fish4. Bush Keluak Ayam5. Sayur LodehDessert:1. Kueh Dah Dah2. Kueh Beng Kah3. Roti Jala 4. Ice cream with gula Melaka
5
We visited from London and our concierge at the St Regis hotel recommended Violet Oon. We were looked after by Yogi, and she was professional and helpful throughout. She helped us by explaining the dishes to us, and we got overexcited and ordered a lot of food!The flavours were unique and totally unlike anything I've eaten before. A lot of chilli-hot flavours and some very good sized portions.We dressed for fine-dining although I noticed the crowd was mixed, although mostly smart.The dining room is retro-colonial with a slightly Parisian feel, and it can be very difficult to book as it is not a large premises.I have uploaded some pics from our visit. If you would like to try a meal which is daring and unusual, this is for you. I would like to thank Yogi for making our meal special with her personable and friendly service
5
Absolutely mind blowing Peranakan fare. Our starter of chunky satay with peanut sauce paired very well with a bottle of bubbly Blanc de Blancs. Every dish worked magic on the palate, matched perfectly with a couple of bottles of JJ Prum and Egon Muller. The star of the evening was Ms Yogi whose service and friendliness matched the quality of food to complete a superb evening
5
The team at our Singapore office took me here for lunch - and I am so happy they did. The food is amazing (we ordered most things!) and the staff are just lovely! I was addicted to the peanut sauce that came with the satay, so our waiter got me a little pot to take home with me - and it survived the journey back to London :
5
My first visit to this place since i was hunting a place for lunch. I did not do any booking but managed to get the bar area for lunch.Food was great ! Had ngoh hiang, taohu goreng, satay and sambal brinjal.Ngoh hiang was fantastic ! Satay was great with the sauce.For spicy lovers , sambal sauce was awesome..Sambal brinjal goes well with the just plain rice.Also had hand brewed kopi o peng by Paul at the bar counter ! Great service !Ended with their dessert with pulut hitam with coconut ice creamOne of the best meal experience for a local singaporean 
5
A Great Place For A High Tea..
The food were good & well served by the staffs. Special Thanks to Yogi & Paul.
5
Excellent food with good service.
Delicious beef rendang.
The dessert, especially Kueh Beng Kah and Kueh Dah Dah
Will definitely come back
5
Great ambience, great food and great staff!! The food came quite soon after ordering and the staff were very attentive to customers based on what I've seen. All-in-all, this restaurant is highly recommended - i would definitely go there again!
1
Food is way too oily. Chicken in chicken rice is not tender. Not ideal to bring family. Overall not a good experience
4
The restaurant has a great atmosphere and the satay was fantastic. Prices were a bit high, so more like a business restaurant than a family night out.
4
Great food and ambience is perfect! But remember to book in advance by using chope which is super convenient.
4
We stumbled upon this restaurant while checking out the yayoyi kusama exhibition at the national gallery. We did not have the foresight to make a reservation but they managed to put us at the bar. We enjoyed the food and recommend the dry laksa. Paul the bartender is very friendly and has been most helpful in following up on our orders
3
serving local food with a modern twist, very presentable and is an idea eating place for friends from overseas. Perhaps the day I went was a public holiday so it was quite crowded and noisy plus the shortage of staff so the service was a bit slow
5
The food was incredible and the service was exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble, and combined with the delicious food and atmosphere, we had a really fabulous experience. We've eaten at some incredible restaurants around the world, and the service and food was up with the best. We will be back! (And thank you to Paul for the amazing Singapore Sling!!)
4
As soon as you walk in the decor hits you, gorgeous. We arrived without a booking and near the end of the lunch service and place was full but was offered a space at the bar which turned out perfect as the bar man engaging and knowledgeable. Food a delight but sadly they had run out of satay. Shared a salad, coronation chicken and meats wrapped in tofu. A very enjoyable lunch indeed.
5
Food and service were excellent. Beautiful venue! Must order dry laksa and beef rendang, best dishes by far.
4
This place has really great ambience and is perfect for group dinner and afternoon tea.
Food is delicious and unique.
I have been here 3 times and service is always consistently below average.
Other than that.. it's a fantastic place!
4
Have been having traditional high teas served tea sandwiches and scone etc but this was a lovely change. Love the peranakan bites especially the hae bee hiam sandwich and kueh kedar. More options for teas would be great! Also we were told to come back at 3 sharp when we were 10 mins early because tables were being prepped though there were empty seats available already.
3
the decor is beautifulthe food is ok and decent but you can get the same taste elsewherethe restaurant is overrated and it is just because owned by the food critic, that is why become famousyou can get the same or better food else where but not the ambiance
5
They are full most of the time! Make sure to make a reservation. We had soup, gado gado, satay, rendang, cod with laksa sauce, ayam buah keluak, sayur lodeh, hakka abacus beads, roti jala with gula melaka banana sauce, kueh dar dar and pulot hitam. Though the restaurant is nestled in the (touristy) national gallery, the food tastes authentic and not watered down or tweaked for the "international palate". Classy ambience. Good place to bring your visitors, family and friends alike
4
Consistently good cooking coupled with warm & friendly service. All in a beautiful setting. The only negative would be that it does noisy; would benefit from decor that dampens sound more effectively. Preferably to have larger tables as it's always very tight squeezing in all the beautifully presented dishes that we order
4
My family of 3 enjoyed our meal at the national kitchen. The chicken satays and fried mantou buns we started with were delicious. I had the beef rendang which was not heated through enough but still tasty. My husband and daughter loved their Hainan chicken. All in all a lovely meal sampling local specialties
3
National Kitchen is located on Level 2 of the National Gallery of Singapore and is a small intimate space decorated in a mix of colonial and Peranakan local design. We selected the Singapore High Tea set SGD56++ (2pax) to try a different Peranakan food experience. We had a very nice waiter who produced a souvenir photo of us for our anniversary celebration and the kitchen surprised us with a slice of tapioca cake decorated with a candle for the occasion.As a modern interpretation the food overall was fine with various delicious elements however it was more the whole ambience of having a high tea together with the design surrounds that contributed to the overall enjoyable experience. Perhaps Peranakan food is best appreciated in its traditional form as proper dishes and meals for the complexity of flavours to really sing
3
After all the hype we were expecting a delight, much to our chagrin we ended up haveing a meal that was far less tasty and far more expensive than the hawkers market.The Maitre' D was the only helpful member of the staff. Considering it is a celebration of Straits cuisine, the staff was unhelpful in describing the dishes or recommending them. The drinks they suggested were sweet and dull and took a long time coming. The food was lukewarm and not at all paired well. The ambiance is good but goes with a local person who knows food, do not rely on the rude, sloppy and uninformed staff

My 4th visit and still so many wow-moments for me, both with the food and the service. My current top 5 faves must be the super yummy coronation chicken starter, buah keluak noodles, cod in creamy laksa sauce, slow braised beef cheek, roti jala dessert. Special credit mention this time around to host Raj for his impeccable service and making my elderly mom feel so at home during our most recent lunch visit there. Cheers to him and the crew for another memorable outing at VO's

Had an enjoyable time at National Kitchen. Food was of a high quality, nice ambience, quick and efficient service
4
A must visit if you are from out of town. Delicious Peranakan food in a beautiful setting. Servers were knowledgable and engaging. The afternoon tea looked great too although we were there for lunch.
5
My second visit and like my first, food and service were awesome! We had a great time and would definitely be back again!
5
What an experience!! It was an interesting place to try and find, but the walk through the National Gallery was an experience in itself. The good was outstanding; a taste sensation. Highly recommended!!!
5
So far one of my favorite eating experience in sg. The service was really nice and the food was awesome. As a tourist, I will introduce to everyone when back in china.

Checked out this beautiful peranakan restaurant while I was visiting Singapore. We prebook the tables weeks ahead for the 630pm slot. Ordered ngoh hiang, ji hu char, beef rendang, chilli crab, garam asam fish and the butter prawns. Service was good but overall I think taste wise, they could do better. Also, price tag is of course set for a fine dining atmosphere P/s: Do NOT order the chilli crab if you can't handle super duper spicy food. You can literally see the chilli seeds in the sauce. I personally think the spicyness overpowered the whole dish entirely
4
Had an excellent meal at this restaurant on my birthday. However, for a top quality restaurant paper napkins that fall apart are not the way to impress. Also our main meal was brought to us when we were only half way through our entree. It was obviously put to one side until we were ready, so was served rather tepid. The food itself was very good, as was the wine list. The maitre d from her very good Satay restaurant could give a few tips on friendly, efficient service
4
Tasty Peranakan food in a very cosy classy restaurant that brings u back in time. Price slightly on the high side for the portion but you r paying for the service; ambience and quality. There is a bar too that served in-house cocktails. Many dishes to choose from. Most likely requires a repeated visit. Beef redang was tender and gravy wasn't too rich. Thumbs up. Assam fish was great too w the right level of spice and sourness from pineapples. Appetizing. Dry laksa was so so tho. Too creative for my palette.
5
Offering a fusion of Malay and Chinese food termed peranakan, this awesome little place delivers some outstanding flavor. We shared the kuay pie tee to start (which doesn't look good on paper but in reality was a fantastic blend of flavor and texture) and then the butter shrimp. Fantastic service but beware the drinks are priced at quite a premium. Well worth the visit and make sure you call ahead in advance for booking.
5
My husband and I celebrated our 18 wedding anniversary at National Kitchen BY Violet Oon.It was our first time there, the food and service is excellent.One feedback is that the starter ( kueh pie tee) was too big a portion, it comes in one size which is 8 pieces, too much for the two of us. Could not order more, as the portion is too huge. Overall, excellent, will go back for second visit
5
Food was great and service impeccable. Served one of the best peranakan food we had and trust us, we been to alot of restuarants for this.
5
Great food, great ambience, fantastic service. When they know that we are celebrating my friend's birthday. They surprise us with a slice of cake with candle. And a print out photo of us as souvenir. Wonderful and lovely gesture.
5
Not the typical high tea treats, but the items tasted awesome. Ambience and service staff were perfect.
4
It was the perfect venue for a mother's day high-tea treat. The attentive and friendly service made it a memorable outing. The wait staff took time to explain the key ingredients which went into preparing the little delicacies.
4
You know when you want to eat something that's going to liven up your taste buds ..something with interesting and spicy flavours but you're not sure what to have? This is Peranakan cuisine - original Chinese settlers who came to Penang. We had the chicken and prawn bostador...a standout flavour punch, the eggplant sambal, the Dry Mee Siam noodles and the Hakka Abacus...rice cake texture but actually taro dumplings. The eggplant wedges were absolutely delicious, in fact everything was fabulous. Not cheap but we would go back.The atmosphere is almost a gentleman's club with highly skilled waiters and an old fashioned sense of service
5
 This restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of National Gallery. It is very popular for lunch and dinner. Reservations recommended. However, we managed to secure a table for Hi-tea at around 3.30pm without reservation on our visit. We had the $52(for 2pax) plus additional dry laksa($16 for 2pax) set Hi-tea for 2pax. It comes with free flow coffee and tea. I highly recommend the lemongrass tea, pink in Colour with a slight hint of lemongrass. It has a vey fragrant smell. The Hi-tea food selection is really good too, the Peranakan Kueh are really well made. Must try! The dry laksa is thick, just nicely wet and not too spicy. Definitely worth eating....National Gallery can be reached by taking the MRT to City hall station. The Gallery has a nice art collection that is worth visiting.
3
The food was reasonably good, the service though on the slow side was friendly, and the decor was classically eclectic, a nice balance of the colonial with the local. Even the choice of music gave it an upbeat, contemporary twist. No quarrel with that. But the volume of the speakers was shockingly loud. So loud that it was annoying even when you were willing to tolerate a noisy lunchtime. Noise from a hawker centre would have been less intrusive. This sounded like a shove-it-down-no-conversation kind of place. We hurried out without ordering dessert, although the dessert menu looked delectable. The member of staff whom we had asked to turn down the volume before we sat down said it wouldn't be so loud at our table; other than that she had no interest in whether or not the volume was comfortable for customers. If you do want to go there, bring your earplugs
5
We dined for lunch there for the second time and it was excellent. Only fault was that they had sold out of chicken satay and that is the most delicious thing on the menu! Otherwise the food was full of flavour and the staff very attentive and great with kids.
3
My favourite dish was the ngoh hiang! this is a great place to bring your foreign friends to, if you would like them to try a variety of local dishes in a comfortable air-con environment. if you're reserving a table for 2-4 pax, request to not get a table in the middle of the restaurant, cos the square tables can be quite cramped. they were also quite low - my husband who's tall had to sit at an angle because his legs couldn't go under the table
5
There is a waitress that worked at the National Gallery location that works here too. She definitely defines extraordinary care. She went above and beyond to ensure I would be okay eating foods that they served because of my allergies. Her recommendations for the satay and the drinks we had were on point! The other servers were just as good. The food came out timely. The bar tender made drinks in a speedy manner and the quality was really good. Nothing seemed rushed. Everyone seems to enjoy working there. Great feel. Yummy food. Wonderful fancy drinks. They give you the history of the foods as well if you want. Overall, wonderful experience
4
The decor and ambiance provided by Violet Oon at the National Gallery are superb. But I find the food a little too bland with taste more catered to foreigners.
5
Love how the Chef's have kept the tradition going.. My time spent during my visit was just awesome! Am thankful for the warm and attentive service and the complimentary photo taking session ! Thank you!
5
Rich flavored peranakan food with a twist. The friendly service crew made sure that we are well taken care of, always checking if the food was alright. Great place for family :)
4
Good environment & nice interior design with the mixture of modern classic and Peranakan design. Food was marvellous.
5
It was great that I can treat my fussy m-i-l to local dishes, with nice environment and using fine ingredients.
4
Nice place for dinning. A refreshing approach on how the food is prepared and served. Certain dishes the portions are bit small.
4
I was extremely impressed by this restaurant. Having read great reviews the ambience of the restaurant fit met us with great expectations. Foof was sublime, and we have pickles and salad for entree followed by a magnificent fish curry and chill in prawns. The flavours were magnificent the staff very accommodating. A great restaurant in Singapore.
5
Located inside the National Gallery of Singapore, the smallish but elegant restaurant is an excellent place to taste heirloom peranakan dishes like their spicy fish head, beef rendang, buttered prawns, and dry laksa. The place is quite small but nicely decorated which can make a walk-in customer intimidated. The waiters and attendants however were very welcoming. Since the place can get fully booked easily, it is best to reserve beforehand. Highly recommended place to try..
4
We booked for the 8.30pm time slot. The restaurant is within the beautiful old gallery building. We ordered a few dishes but the highlight was definitely the beef rendang. It was the best we'd had anywhere. Unfortunately the restaurant is loud so it was hard to have a conversation. Staff apologised over the noise as there was a big table of about 20 next to us. The noise was the only downside
5
Took a group of friends from overseas to National Kitchen for a taste of Peranakan cooking. Our waiter arranged a perfect sample menu touching on vegetable, fish and meat specialties and tailored to our bespoke spice requests. The food was interesting and delicious. Great and warm staff
3
The chicken satay was delicious alrhough the peanut sauce is unusual. The beef rendang was tender but the gravy was too sweet, so as the sayur lodeh. The dry laksa was okay. The red snapper with pineapple was delicious.
5
Lunch was a birthday lunch and a reward-lunch. Excellent food and service for awardee. This should be an awarding kitchen too!
2
Made reservation at 2pm. Was told to leave the restaurant by 3pm as they will be having their afternoon tea.
4
Walking into a gallery was a great start to this meal. And the actual restaurant itself was beautifully decorated. The space was intimate, richly decorated and created a relaxed ambience. Service was mainly good. Our main waiter was great and friendly. The others not so good, on arrival they did not have our table ready and some of the other service staff seemed liked they were throwing the food at us. Food was delicious. It was all tasty, the beef melted in your mouth, not too spicy and a good selection to choose from. That being said some dishes were not available. Desserts an excellent highlight to finish.
4
If you are visiting Singapore for a few days, be sure to make a booking at the National Kitchen. Violet Oon now has a few restaurants but this one at the National Gallery is extra special because it it inside the National Gallery and features some beautiful art deco design. Food is spot on (get the Gado Gado, Beef Rendang, Nasi Lemak rice and the Dry Laksa). It is slightly expensive for what the food is (having grown up with this food and the availability to get this kind of food in hawker centres) hence I'm giving this 4 stars. Otherwise, this is a not-to-be-missed place
5
This is the 2nd time I brought my parents to National Kitchen. Love the ambience, food and service. Beef rendang is a MUST order, Curry Fish head is good too. End off lunch with a cuppa Kopi.. perfect! Definitely 1 of my Favourite restaurants in Singapore
5
The National Kitchen at the National Gallery is a beautiful representation of traditional Peranakan cuisines. It's a popular place among locals and foreign visitors, among them foreign head of state and royalty as invited by the Government.My wife and I came here for dinner and we had a lovely time with the quality of the food and level of services that was beyond our expectation - the bartender saw my wife charging her iPhone with the portable battery and offered to charge it for her at the counter.We had the Kuay Pie Tee, Butter Prawns, Sayur Lodeh, and Nasi Lemak rice; to finish off we had the Kueh Dah Dah for desserts. Portion was quite generous and taste was authentic.The ambience was elegant and with an old world charm.We enjoyed the experience
3
The Rendang is delish. Melts in your mouth! Love d decor n ambience. Everything was pleasant until one of the waiters came to inform us we had to make payment & leave soon as the next guests would be arriving. I find this to be a distasteful & unacceptable. We hadn't even ordered dessert & no one approached us earlier. We were like given 5-10 minutes to order and leave. Besides, the kitchen does take a while as well to prep d good food. We hastily ordered Pulut Hitam & took our leave shortly, disappointed that the evening ended on that note.
4
Pricey. But all the dishes were flavoursome and cooked well. Beef cheeks are tender and broke down easy with a good amount of spice. Butter prawns so fragrant, but just wished there says a bit more sauce on them as they are a little dry and possibly overcooked.
5
Was spoiled by friends who threw me a party here. Absolutely fantastic food and service. Two dinner seatings - 6:30 and 8:30. The views from the restaurant overlooking the Padang and the Marina Bay Sands are dazzling. Great food - ngoh hiang, beef rendang, curry, quay pie tee (oh my amazing), cod in creamy laksa sauce, and for the adventurous eater, try the bush keluak. Service was spot on and attentive. Definitely a place for a special evening with friends or family. Go here
5
A great experience with tasty food. Great location with view of bay. The decor is unique. Great selection of traditional dishes.
5
The food, service, ambiance were all fantastic. Took some time getting the reservation but it was worth the wait.
5
Food was mostly excellent! Price is decent, though portion can be more generous. Complimentary birthday cake is a bonus.
5
If you're unwilling to "slum" it out at Singapore's hawker centres and other more casual dining locations, National Kitchen is probably the best posh place to get authentic local food. The menu is good selection of best of / must try local dishes. Portions are substantial so it would be advisable to go with 4 or more pax to fully enjoy the variety of dishes. We were 2 and we ordered ngoh hiang, satay, rendang, sambal udang goreng, nasi lemak, dry laksa and kueh beng kah. Everything was delicious. Special mention: dry laksa and kueh bang kah. Spice level is very reasonable for the uninitiated and they provide extra sambal for those who love a punch. All in all, a great experience. Will recommend to others and will go back for more.
4
Everything was incredibly delicious and beautifully presented. Also, if you avoid the alcohol I thought the price was very reasonable for such high quality food. Even the satay was extra tasty - a dish I often find quite ordinary in other restaurants. I loved the design of the restaurant also - intimate, colourful and tastefu
3
We went to National Kitchen for a gathering of ex-colleagues but it was too noisy to even hear one another for some decent catching up. Practically the entire place was booked for a birthday celebration, barring a few tables. Service was friendly but slow for our standards. Perhaps the staff were overwhelmed by the number of patrons but we shouldn't have to ask for water glasses to be refilled in such an establishment. Overall the place was beautifully decorated and the food was decent. Satay was delicious (don't expect a typical peanut sauce) and dessert was good. Serving sizes were good for sharing. Prices were reasonable. Odd location for a dinner restaurant as the National Gallery was closed and the entire place was deserted, but I can imagine it being a nice place to drop by for lunch while visiting the exhibits. Restaurant windows had a great view of MBS/Marina Bay
3
food is not bad, but difficult to order when without photos. especially it's a local cuisine and we have difficulties in interpreting it.staff were always busy and occupied. not much attention given.i was not being convinced why this restaurant would be housed at the national gallery. May visit again but to other of violet's outlets, maybe better to dine with a group
4
We chose this restaurant for my sisters birthday dinner and it was so lovely. The restaurant decor and ambience is beautiful and the staff friendly - although service was off to a slow start, they made up for it with good recommendations. The food was delicious but for me very spicy, for the others at our table not so much, perhaps they could note which dishes are spicier than others?? The stand out dishes were the Rendang and Butter Prawns. Highly recommend and would definitely visit again.
5
The service by the staff from the beginning was outstanding. Every detail and request attended to promptly. The variety of local food dishes and their quality was outstanding. Loved the d√É¬©cor and ambience of the restaurant. Definitely returning for a third time! I had afternoon tea on a previous visit and it was just as remarkable
5
I took my mum, her sisters, brother in law and sister in law to lunch at violet Oon kitchen in National Gallery on Friday. My uncle, who is a Baba, thoroughly enjoyed the lunch - told me it brought back memories of his childhood. My aunties who seldom eat peranakan food liked the food v much too. Esp the fish head curry and the beef cheeks. Uncle Sim found the Kuay bun bang (?) too sweet but everyone raved over the kuay dah dah. I m very impressed with the service of the waiting Staff, esp the gentleman who looked after our orders/table of 8. The birthday group photo was a v nice gesture and much appreciated. My aunties have posted the photo on their facebooks 
5
A nice place chilling out with family and friends. The only concern is to book in advanced with limited seat constraints.
5
The National Kitchen by Violet Oon is my go-to place for yummeh Peranakan cuisine with a lovely ambience!! ‚ú® I appreciate the attentive service too!! üëçüèªüòçüòç
5
If you come to Singapore dont miss this restaurant. Good food, good staff, good service , good music . We will come back for sure .
4
Enjoyed the ambience and most of the dishes, in particular the chicken satay, dry laksa, and beef rendang. Pity it's a small place, so reservation is required.
4
had lunch there with a bunch of relatives. The d√É¬©cor is outstanding. Lots of care gone into lots of detail. Great work. The experience is carried on by the professional staff. Lots of them and very attentive. This is capped by the talents of the kitchen. great food. The dry laksa, the eggplant dish, the beef cheeks, all spices balanced on every dish. Overall an outstanding experience. Will be back. Keep up the great work folks
5
Evening meal with relatives whilst staying in Singapore.What an experience! Beautiful surroundings, elaborate chandeliers, wonderful food and excellent service.A selection of chinese dishes were ordered, presentation was outstanding and the meal was delicious.The staff were attentive at all times and first class.An amazing experience and will definitely come back on a return visit.You should try it!!Wonderful views of Singapore from the balcony
5
We had a reservations at 7pm and five min before, they called and advised us the table will be late as the previous diners were late. But we were already on site since they did warn us they only hold the table for 15 min. But their damage recovery was impeccable. They quickly whisked us to a table outside and offered a first drink on them plus a free starter. Who will still complain after that right? Haha. The staff also came to check on us several times during the dinner and again apologized. Senior restaurant manager Yoges was really lovely.Food was really good too. Definitely will go back again as their best seller dessert was sold out by the time we were done with dinner. The Chianti on the wine list went perfectly with the spicy food too.Tip:We were advised to reserve it next time with our reservations haha ... including the satay
4
Met friends here to introduce them to quality Singaporean food. Booked table some days in advance and it was full. Old style colonial decor with photos of old Singapore on the walls. Excellent service with explanation of dishes. Coronation chicken is not the English version - much tastier. Black noodles better than expected and the Buah Keluak ayan using candle nut was delicious. Suggested drinking just jasmine tea to enjoy the flavours ( camomile included). Portions are small but sufficient
4
We ate here on a recent visit to Singapore and the food was excellent.The menu has some good options on this although some may find it limited I enjoy smaller menus.We started with the coronation chicken and chicken wings which were both well presented and cooked.We then shared a dry laksa and beef rendang which were again well presented and cooked although next time I would try the rendang I would not have the Laksa again.We had the mains with some coconut rice each and my daughter had some of the chicken rice which she loved.The staff were excellent, helpful and very friendly but professional at the same time which is always great.The cost of the food was also in my opinion very reasonable for the quality and service you receive and I would definitely return.The reason why it was not 5 rated is due to the spice of the food as my wife could not eat this easily on a dish that should not have been as hot I feel, my first appetiser option was not available and there was a table of very loud an opinionated people in the restaurant who drowned out everything else and should have been asked to be quiet by the staff.You could say these are things that the restaurant have varying degrees of control over but just sharing my experience on the night
4
We were introduced by a friend to this charming old style colonial restaurant. We had a great supper sharing dishes. The table booking system is fairly strict as it is clearly in great demand. The waiting staff were very helpful showing us pictures on their phone of the foods and the ingredients but also rather busy so needed to be reminded about additional requests as that they might forget. The food was interesting and loved the black noodles! The portion sizes were fair but not enormous. We also had chilli prawns which were delicious. One of us had lemon grass tea ( but it also has the addition of camomile) and a couple of us had white wine (sauvignon blanc) but would recommend sticking to the tea - which worked well with the food. We didn't have any desserts.A lovely ambience in an old style bit of history with authentic pictures on the walls. Also an opportunity to nip into the Singapore Museum afterwards
4
My 4th time dining here and the food quality still remains consistent. Portions are a little small for the price thats paid and service is a little slow as always. But still a restaurant i would visit for the quality of food.
5
There you get all the best dishes that the kitchen of Singapore can offer you.
It is a very stylish and classy restaurant.
The service is top class!!
However, you need reservations- and you have to reserve weeks before you are going.
5
A warm welcome followed by the best beef rendeng I've ever had! Then when I thought I couldn't possibly - I tried the tapioca cake
/pudding with coconut cream - literally heAvenly! Big thanks to Saat and the team for looking after me so well!
5
Very delighted with the food and service. Strongly recommend for those who loves Peranakan food. Please make reservation before heading to the restaurant
4
Fortunately we booked a table for 6pm on a Sunday evening arriving slightly early to beat a thunder storm. Somewhat surprised to find a number of others already waiting for opening time, 6pm sharp. The Service is excellent, as is the food. We shared an entree (satay chicken) as we also wished to be sure of making it to desert. My excellent beef rendang melted in the mouth, matched by the cod mains ordered by my wife.Regrettably somewhat replete we were obliged to share and enjoy the tapioca cake desert. All this washed down with a glass of French red and white wine as recommended by the attentive staff. Highly recommended but very busy so be sure to book
4
Here for dinner with a friend recently. Had the coronation chicken, kueh pie tee and tahu goreng to start and then garam Assam fish, Sayur lodeh and nasi lemak for mains. The fish and the tahu goreng were particularly tasty. I ordered the Haliatini cocktail which was really delicious. Including tax it worked out to about SGD 90 each.For the setting, the quality of the food and drinks, it was pricey but worth it. Probably good for a special occasion
5
We had visited the National Gallery and were looking for lunch. We found our way to the National Kitchen and what a wonderful hour or two we had there. Even as we sat down, it was apparent that people had come there to enjoy themselves and were quietly doing just that. You knew that you had made a good choice.Symbolic of the level of service was the pouring of my beer by our waiter - a career man obviously, who produced the perfect head on the beer, a picture which could have earned a place in any beer advert in any top class magazine. My wife, beef dish and my portion of chicken were beautifully prepared and served, full of flavour The faces of fellow diners (one or two in feeding chairs!) reflected the same level of satisfaction as we were enjoying.Just to return to the service: it was the best we have had in any restaurant since our lunch at the Crillion, Paris, ten years ag
5
The National Kitchen sits in the same building as the National Gallery. This is a great place to escape the busyness (and heat) of Singapore while enjoying great authentic cuisine. Reservations are recommended. When we arrived, they told us there would be no seating without a reservation. The ma√Ætre d' overheard and kindly offered us a table ‚Äî even took our order while we waited. As an starter, I enjoyed a sort of chicken curry salad served in a fried wonton bowl. It was delicious. My main course was tian tian chicken rice. The rice was light, but richly aromatic. The broth was complex and soothingly textured. Overall, excellent. Highly recommend.
5
Put a range of dining options within the National Art Gallery and have them open in the evening too, when the Gallery is closed - an interesting concept. Consequently you should find out exactly where the restaurants are to avoid confusion and stress. Violet Oon's restaurant has been developed to look like an old cosy wood panelled restaurant. The surfaces are hard, and the noise levels high. The staff were excellent on our visit. The food is a fascinating combination of the traditional and the hybrid, and the quality is high, and the tastes memorable. the Kuay Pie Tee is an amazing traditional starter, with its crispy shell and prawn topping. The daging chabek is a modern hybrid, with beef cheeks in a spicy tamarind gravy. it is to die for, with deep and rich flavours, and a meltingly tender texture. The cod in laksa sauce is a stunning dish, both in looks and taste. At $39 it isn't a cheap dish, but you art paying for creativity and high quality. I loved too the combination of black sticky rice and coconut ice cream. A place to return to when I've saved more pocket money
3
Portions are large but generally very good. A starter of rojak salad which contained rose apples, sour mango and jellyfish was interesting but a little too sweet and sticky for me. The classic chicken and rice was delicious (ask for thigh rather than breast meat for max flavour) and the lace pancakes were good but, again, a little too sweet for me. Lovely surroundings and won't hurt your purse
5
Price reasonable, great food, warm service and awesome interior. The prawn noodle was a bit spicy though. Anyway, I would like to visit again.
5
The ambience and setting was simply breath taking. I loved the food quality and taste and the staff were extremely helpful and courteous. Definitely will go back here.
5
Far more than we could eat, but oh so good. A decent amount of kick to some of the dishes, but flavours by the shed load... portion sizes were large, so plan accordingly - two appetisers and two mains would have been more than enough - just makes it harder to choose...! Highly recommend the Kuay Pie Tee for starter, and for mains the bostador, beef rendang, dry laksa and sambal eggplant. If you have enough space, the tapioca dessert is like a wonderful soft toffee..
3
We had dinner at this restaurant, having found it on tripadvisor. Beware - it is not easy to find within the Gallery. Decor is very attractive: colonial style. Unfortunately we did not find the food very exciting and portions were very small, even though we are not big eaters, so we went away hungry. Maybe we should have ordered more dishes but we were given limited time at our table. Include the 18% tax and service and it was quite an expensive meal
5
What an experience! Unique local with details that one should spend time to watch. We were well received and our waitress: Sa'at gave us a service one must search far to find today. Knowledgeable, attentive and all the time he constantly looked after other guests too.The food was Michelin Star worthy. A sight for the eyes. Flavors that exploded in your mouth, and you would just have more. Here we come very gladly again. Thank you for an experience we will never forget.
4
We had our company dinner here- 30 of us in a long table.Food was tasty and the service was commendable. Ms. Yoges, the restaurant manager ensured that the guests were well taken care of. Since we were a big group, the space for movement was limited. Overall, it was a pleasant experience
4
The experience at Violet Oon National Gallery was a very pleasant one. The ngoh Hiang was awesome, we were afraid the portion would be petite sizes but surprisingly generous. I was never a fan of buak kelak but The Ayam buak kelak changed my mind about buak kelak forever, and now it would be a dish I would order all the time. The meatless meatballs is the icing on the cake for this meal. Who would have thought meatless meatballs would taste this good. You're given 3 options for rice, we went for the Nasi lemak and the chicken rice. Both were so fragrant I could eat them on its own. I would give the tauhu goreng a miss completely, it is deconstructed and felt like like it little or no attention was paid into making this dish, the menu would be perfect without this on it. Great customer service, food and ambiance, though we wished the table was bigger so we could enjoy more dishes slowly than to finish each dish quickly so we can anticipate for the next to come. The table was only big enough for 2-3 dishes at once, we ordered 8 dishes in total.
5
have been here for at least 10 times and have never been disappointed. Dishes are well prepared, quality ingredients and a good blend of spices. service is prompt, helpful and courteous. Raj is always ready to explain dishes and guide in the ordering. will definitely keep returning for yet another delicious meal
2
If you want to have a gathering for a drink its a perfect place. Service is good and interior decoration is good.The food is terrible. The tumeric fried chicken wings is hard and over fried. The beef rendang meat is like eating bean curd, it doesn't feel like meat at all. The dry mee siam, the noodle is not thin mee hoon. You only tell that to a tourist that its mee siam, we know its not. You use the wrong noodle, you cannot use laksa noodle and call it mee siam.Its fine if you go there for a drink to quench your thirst and its a nice place to rest your feet.
5
This place has been a fantastic experience. We were there at 12 in the afternoon and the first people to go in the restaurant. It is absolutely beautifully decorated and very classy. In a matter of minutes it was full so it must be really popular. We were lucky because we din't had a reservation but you should really have one. The service was impeccable and the person assigned to our table was very careful to discretely fill up our glass or to help/ explain if needed (with a smile on his face!). The fool was exceptional. I have to say, it's probably one of the best I had in Singapore. I went there because of the Peranakan heritage of the place and the food & experience was superb. I will gladly come back for a special occasion
5
We had a wonderful experience celebrating my wife's birthday over lunch at this nicely decorated restaurant. Environment was cozy, food was excellent, service staff were friendly and attentive. We couldn't have asked for more! Will definitely visit this place again soon.
5
My second visit to National Kitchen. The service is always impeccable and food is above average. Love the setting and great place to bring visitors.
5
Food is reasonable and also portion big enough for 3 pax if you order for 2pax if small eater will even cater for 4pax. Quality of food also very good.
4
Food is always good here and their service team is excellent. They know their food well, make good recommendations and always joke and engage in friendly banter with guests. The only thing I did not like was the fact that we have to give up our tables for the second seating. We had dinner at 7pm and had to leave the table at 8.15pm and since it was a business-related dinner, this was disruptive. It doesn't matter if you start dinner at 6pm or 7pm, the table must be given back at 8.15pm. Had I known this, I would have started dinner early at 6pm instead of taking the 7pm booking. Perhaps this could be highlighted over the phone when calling guests to confirm. Other than this, lovely place

We had a very nice dinner in this amazing venue. After a drink on the roof top bar you can head to the restaurant in the beautiful building. The food is really nice with a range of options to suit a broad range of punters. You should not miss the opportunity when in town to visit.
5
We are from Sydney & had read about the Nonya food of Singapore so went with friends to try this restaurant. Absolutely amazing! The food was fantastic! I can't find enough superlatives to describe our dinner. We have been to many god restaurants but this was the best meal we have ever had. The flavours are extraordinary. The Beef Rendang, the Beef Cheek and the Dry Laksa were standouts. Thank you Violet & staff for such a beautiful meal & a terrific experience in Singapore.

The food was truly outstanding, with many creative choice and combinations. Be careful of the spices, some can be overwhelmingly hot so just ask when choosing. The decor is very nice, a luxury but intimate feel. Service was top notch. If you are prepared to pay at the high end, this is a great choice in Singapore

On a recent visit to Singapore I was lucky to be taken to The National Kitchen for a birthday celebration. The restaurant is attractive with Edwardian-type d√É¬©cor, and waiting staff were efficient and friendly. All the dishes we ordered were delicious and portions were very generous. I particularly enjoyed the walnut dumplings and turmeric chicken wings. My daughter had mentioned that it was my birthday and at the end of the meal they brought a slice of cake with a candle and even took a photo which was printed and given to us in a nice folder as we left.I do have a couple of minor quibbles which may seem ungracious but I feel should be mentioned. The air conditioning was very cold and we weren't the only diners who were rubbing bare arms with the chill. The tables were very small and it was hard to fit all the dishes on as they arrived. And finally, the nearest bathrooms were a long distance away in the Gallery and the signage was limited. This is hardly the fault of the restaurant but was an inconvenience
5
Had a birthday lunch with my family here and Seraj did a very well planned last minute suprise for my sister. Very delicious beng kah kue and there was even a printed photo! The ambience was extremely cozy and gorgeous. Needless to say, most of the the food was delicious.My favourites were the pie tee, sayur lodeh, beng kah kue and kopi - two cups! Not a fan of the dry laksa as the tao gey (beansprout) taste was too strong and the chicken wings, i dont know how to explain but regret ordering it. I feel the dishes were hit or miss. Excellent service (five stars for attentiveness) provided by Seraj & the rest of the servers. Will be back again in future. Oh, do make a reservation as the resturant has limited sitting and it can get really packed
5
We had the most superb evening at the National Kitchen by Violet Oon in the National Gallery in Singapore - marvellous service from wonderfully attentive and friendly staff serving utterly delicious and memorable dishes. We had Rojak, Satay, Excellent prawn and chicken entree and a wonderful chicken stew, followed by delicious dessert roti - each an absolute hallmark of fabulous Peranakan flavours. Good wine - a French Viognier matched the food perfectly. The delightful surprise at the end was an amazing lemongrass, camomile and hibiscus tea which set a perfect end to a terrific meal. I'd give the National kitchen at least 12 out of 10. We will be back
5
I would strongly recommend for lovers of Peranakan food. Highly recommend the Beef Cheek and Rendang, Ayam Buah Keluak noodles and Dry Laksa. For desserts the Roti Jala is unique, however selections are limited compared to other outlet in Bukit Timah.
5
Visited this bistro style restaurant in January and was very impressed with the efficiency, the service and most of all the food.
4
The beautifully decorated restaurant inside the National Gallery is filled with Peranakan Heritage and design. Chandeliers against dark wooden panels and decoratively colourful tiles add to the atmosphere of the experience. What to try? Start with the chicken rice.
4
I would return again both for the service and the menu - in fact this was already my second visit. The 'fifth' star/rating is missing purely because there was a large party there (approx 30 people) and it would have been good for the restaurant to have notified those already booked of this. They phoned to confirm the booking the day before - why not mention the group at the same time, as the atmosphere/ambiance was very different from my first experience. At times my daughter and I were unable to hear each other. We may well have chosen another night - not another restaurant though, as I've been waiting to share this lovely Peranakan food with her for several months
3
This is my 2nd visit here, though it is the first for high tea. My first visit was for dinner. I remembered I had a very pleasant and memorable dinner date with my friends that I couldn't wait to bring my family to try out this wonderful restaurant. The atmosphere is still great, service as well. Though it does get abit too noisy, and we have to wait for awhile to get the server's attention. Nonetheless, this was all met with a smile from them always. Foodwise, I have to admit that I do still prefer the dinner menu. Although we were a party of 6, and ordered 2 high tea sets with 5 light bites dishes, we could hardly finished the meal and ended up having to take away the remaining. Most of us felt that the dishes were abit too heavy in taste. The chili crab mantou were bit too spicy and the dry laksa was atad too salty. However, this is just our own personal taste buds and I would still visit for the dinner menu! I do love their kueh dah dah kueh lapis still!
2
The dining room is a gorgeous classic bistro setting and very cosy without being on top of the next table. The chandeliers, the mirrors on the ceiling and was land the bar at one end of the room were all really effective. I brought my parents who are visiting Singapore. They are adventurous and love eating out and trying new foods. I was surprised that there was a very limited wine menu on offer 3 choices of red wine. And as novel at the menu is and also reasonably priced, FIVE items on the menu were not available on a Saturday night. This irritates me - can the kitchen not manage their covers? According to our waiter, this was a common occurrence. As for the service - as friendly as our waiter was - it was all quite hard work. The wine took an age to arrive at the table. We had to ask for a G&T three times before it arrived. All the starters arrived at different times. All the main courses arrived at different times. The food was tasty and creative and well presented, but a bit of an effort to order and then to have it served seamlessly. It was a beautiful setting and lovely atmosphere but I wouldn't choose to return in a hurry.
5
A delightful experience that started with a courteous interaction with Lynette from the reservations desk to the reception, food and service. The seating at The National Gallery is somewhat limited, but very tastefully decorated. We were with friends who strongly recommended Violet Oon and were not disappointed. We tasted over a dozen different dishes and all of them - from salads, starters and main course to desserts was extremely flavorful and delicious. The place was very noisy initially with a large group dominating the space - their departure had a definite improvement to the overall experience. The white wine paired well with the food. Would have loved to pick up the cook books of the famed owner at the restaurant...a hint for reprints
5
Singaporean friends brought us here to try their native local cuisine and we definitely enjoyed ourselves. The curries are so fragrant and the best part is their very humble coconut rice. Their desserts were very good as well.. in particular the green spring roll with coconut (I forgot the name! I'm sure it's not a spring roll!) . I wish we had this in LA..
5
We had a wonderful lunch at National Kitchen. Starting with the Kuay Pie Tee the meal got better finishing with Kueh Dah Dah. Service was great and the overall cost quite reasonable. The restaurant was full but we were accommodated after an hours wait which we spent wandering the gallery. Make the effort to fit in dessert and the homemade ginger beer was very refreshing. Don't miss
5
- except that there was no set lunch menu, which I think is inappropriate, and actually no set menu at all, one always needs to assemble oneself. And I really dislike the Singaporean habit to have museum restaurants least of all for museum patrons! Always full with the generic Straits jeunesse dor√É¬©e types who book forever in advance. (I also won't get used to Singapore top restaurant not offering cloth napkins or wet towels before one eats, but maybe that's just me.) Continuing the slightly grouchy rant, these types also whine about everything, especially service (the only people in the world on par with Gulf states wealthies). Don't believe them, it's part act, part inappropriate entitlement thinking. :) So:This is a great restaurant, the service was absolutely fine, the dark Peranakan decor really world class, the food really excellent, and given that it was the dinner menu, lunch for 2, 3 courses (one split) with water and beer and kopi for $100 is really okay. Especially if the quality is right, which it is - the sate is great (has to be!), cheeks were excellent (just a bit firm), really outstanding butter shrimps, and good net pancakes.And be assured: This *is* Nyonya cuisine, it is authentic (but of course interpreted), and it is excellent. Go
5
Our vist to VO was one of the best food experiances ever had.
The food was sublime. The service was inpecable. The atmosphere and setting was superb.
Its not often to find a restaurant with such attention to details in all aspects of operation.
4
The restaurant is beautiful and take you back in time. The food was very good. The service was good.
4
I'm not expert at nonya food but this place's worth a visit just for the decor alone. Very good place to impress without breaking the bank.
5
We had delicious peranakan food at Violet Oon at the National Gallery. The setting is stunning in quite a small restaurant. Although there were a few large groups being a Sunday lunchtime the service was good, if a little over zealous. We began with the Idly with a coconut and a tomato chutney. The tomato chutney was sublime - I'd love the recipe! We also had the chicken satay - beautiful, the Buah Keluak Ayam which was good and the cod in creamy laksa sauce which was gorgeous with a side of coconut rice. We weren't able to fit in any dessert but will return to try their afternoon tea and definitely to dine again.
5
Yes, the ambience is lovely. Yes, the service is good. But it doesn't even matter because the food was just sublime. Must try- kuay pie tee, coronation chicken, and cod laksaPortions are very small though, so err on the side of over-ordering.Make a booking well in advance because it is justifiably popular!
5
We had the afternoon tea set, as well as the dry laksa add-on. It was properly delicious! The dry laksa was a standout for me. Creamy umami flavours that are lip-smackingly good. My mum raved about the kueh dah dah and tapioca cake cubes. Definitely eat the kueh pie tee first, before the crispy cup absorbs top much liquid from the filling, and save a little bread to mop up the remaining laksa sauce!Coffee was thick and delicious, tea selection limited (lemongrass, earl grey and english breakfast).Restaurant was smaller than I expected but luxuriously decorated. Can be noisy when (almost) full, which may take away from the dining experience.We will definitely go back for afternoon tea again
5
Love the bite sized morsels with a Peranakan twist! The dry laksa was good too Service was average coz they forgot my earl grey tea until I was more than half way through the tea set. And that required 3 reminders... something must have gone wrong in the kitchen. Ran out of tea? Ambience was great minus the music - which was a tad too loud for a nice conversation between ladies
5
I visited The National Kitchen by Violet Oon and was very impressed by the location in the National Museum which, whilst relatively quiet and empty, was a beautiful building. The restaurant itself was stunning. Very classy decor with a buzzing, vibrant atmosphere of people really enjoying their lunchtime experience. I was with a large group of friends and we chose a selection recommended by the Maitre'D and were not disappointed. As in previous comments the Beef Rendang was absolutely delicious. Some dishes weren't to my particular taste but definitely worth trying. The staff were very courteous and friendly and made this visit one to remember. The only drawback was the distance I had to go to find the ladies-I actually got lost in the museum trying to find my way back to the restaurant!!. Would recommend this restaurant but maybe not for the elderly or infirm because of the distance to the Loos!
5
There was a noisey and very large group table. Not good in a room full of hard surfaces as the sounds seems to build and build, but this restaurant still gets 5 stars. The decor is utterly beautiful and ornate and the wait staff were fabulous, attentive and knowledgeable. We got great recommendations for signature dishes from our waiter and the food turned up promptly and it was fresh, light and spicey. The mains were Buah Keluak Ayam and Rendang. The Chicken (Ayam) doesn't need a lot of the nut paste so go easy, and the Rending was melt in the mouth. I've been raving about it all day. Can't wait to go back
5
On special occasions or when I have friends from overseas - this is one restaurant that I will always bring. The food is fantastic, service is faultless (and sincere), and ambience is just great. My fave includes dry laksa, satay (book in advance!!), veg meatballs, ayam buah keluak etc. In fact - most of the food are great (I strongly recommend to go with some rice as the sauce can be thicker and richer than usual).Unfortunately, you usually have to book a week in advance - and sometimes difficult to reach their reservation lines! Love this place regardless, housed in the equally remarkable National Gallery
5
This restaurant came after a long way. We enjoyed it very much. The place was nice. Hosts were careful. Their pieces of advice were also mindful. Food was really good. We highly recommend.
4
Like the food, service and ambience. Just hate the lady who called to confirmed the reservation. She sounded rude and robotic. Encountered same experience over three different reservation.
4
Food is good and good customer service.
But table is too small and area is cramp for comfort.
Restaurant has also gave us a complimentary cake for celebration.
5
The Food was phenomenal and service was even better!!! We asked to be moved due to aloud table next to us and it was no problem. The beef randang was superb!
5
Food was good, service was excellent. Kudos to Sir Raj and Saat for friendliness and professionalism.
4
Great experience in this restaurant inside the Singapore National Gallery.The selection of the appetisers was excellent, while the choice of the main course is a little bit limited, but is still worth trying it.Great atmosphere and lovely music in the background.Brink your bike if you need to go to the gents..
4
I like the ambience and decor. Food was good but a tad too spicy and could been served t hwarmer/hotter. Noh Hiang at $15 is a little steep but one of the very best we have eaten. Dry Mee siam was great but way too spicy. The flavor of the laksa was authentic but againwould be warmer. The pulot hitam was good but when served with a big lump of coconut icecream it becomes less than lukewarm. The pulot hitam could have been served piping hot and will cool down significantly after the icecream is stirred in. Overall I really enjoyed it but like to see these improvements made to the food
3
I love Peranakan food and I have wanted to try one of Violet Oon's restaurants for quite some time. You could say I had high expectations. Unfortunately, my expectations as far as the food was concerned were not met. But let me start with the good points, which is the decor and table service. Think fine dining on china meets corner coffee shop in Malacca, then you get the idea. OK, now for the rest of the experience. The server needed to be called to take our order, and repeatedly to refill our water glasses. One point off. The fish in the Assam Fish tasted fishy, which means it's not fresh. (Really, in a fine dining establishment?) Another point off. The beef in the Rendang was very soft, bordering on mushy. I hope that it was soft because it was a tender piece of beef to start with, like cheek, and not for another reason. But Rendang is made with stew beef and even after cooking all day, it retains a slightly chewy texture. This is subjective, so no points off. I don't mind spending for fine dining and the bill did not disappoint. However, you can get better, more authentic food in a coffee shop for 1/4 the price, so be prepared to pay for the ambiance and not the food and eat before you go to the National Gallery, or try one of the other venues there for lunch
5
Enjoyed every minute at this restaurant. Great to experience really different food. Helpful staff. Interesting decor and top quality food. They were just beginning to serve afternoon tea as we left - if I hadn't eaten so much lunch I would have stayed for tea as it looked amazing

Violet Oon's National Kitchen is located in the National Gallery Singapore, which is housed in two of Singapore's most iconic historical buildings. Walking through the gallery to find the restaurant is a very pleasant experience and you feel the history of the building all around you.We had an 8.30pm reservation and arrived early at around 8pm, so got a drink outdoors while waiting for our table to be ready. We were finally seated at 9pm. I had to return to the hostess's desk a few times to enquire about our table before it was finally ready. I would certainly be sympathetic if a previous table had been taking longer than expected, but given that they seated another party that arrived after we did, I found this very puzzling and unpleasant.To add to the unpleasant service, as soon as we were seated, we were immediately asked to order our dishes. We said we needed a few minutes to read the menu we had just received, and the waiter returned two minutes later, again insisting that we order. He then claimed that the kitchen was closing at 9.30pm and we needed to hurry up. Given that they were at fault for only seating us 30 minutes after our reservation time, hearing them stress the need for speed felt a bit rich and more than a little ironic. From then on the service only worsened. I asked for a hot toddy as I was nursing a sore throat and the bartender flatly refused, saying he couldn't make that. I then ordered the next best thing: hot water with lemon, ginger, honey, which apparently wasn't a problem. (I was tempted to order a shot of whiskey and just pour it into the teapot to make a hot toddy, but didn't want to be too cheeky). Dishes didn't arrive at the same time for all guests, plates were whisked away before we were even done eating, and we felt constantly pressurised to hurry our meal up. Given that noone was taking the table after us, this didn't make much sense.A moment to discuss the food itself - it truly is lovely. I had the meatless meatballs rendang with nasi lemak rice and a kueh dah dah for dessert. The rendang melts in your mouth from the combination of flavours and the gula melaka soaked coconut in the kueh dah dah was utterly delectable. I also tried my friend's pulut hitam which was utterly scrumptious. If you are a first time visitor to Singapore who doesn't have a lot of time but wants to try a variety of Singaporean cuisine and has a comfortable budget, this is a good start. That said, the service is too subpar to justify the price, and if it were overhauled, this restaurant would be perfect
5
Just dessert for thoughts: Perhaps can add one more item to High Tea. Instead of Dry Laska perhaps can give customers an option of perhaps Chendol or Boh Boh Cha Cha for example
5
We had Christmas dinner here and it was a lovely evening. Fantastic food, service and ambience. The staff were so friendly. A must do when in Singapore.
5
The dishes we tried such as the sayeh Lodeh , Assam fish , pong tahu soup and neo hiang were excellent . The blachan chili paste with lime was heavenly and went well with the food . The ambience was nostalgia and music complemented the entire dining experience
5
Came here for the afternoon tea, quite unlike what you'll get at more traditional Colonial haunts like the Raffles. The high tea here is strictly Peranakan delicacies, both sweet and savoury, though served on the three-tiered plates common to afternoon teas elsewhere in the city.The decor, tucked away in the National Gallery, is classic: dark woods, rattan ceiling fans, mirrors and stately chairs. The service is very attentive and they overheard mention of a birthday and, unprompted, brought a cake. The only problem I had was with phoning them for a reservation in the first place: the line is rarely answered and emails are not responded to, though often someone will call back if you have dialled recently.The food is terrific. I had not heard of half of the things on the menu but every one of them was excellent. My favourites were otak crostini and the roti jala (a form of pancakes).
3
We have been to this restaurant for a farewell of one of our friends. It is Perakanan kitchen, so if you love it, go for it, if not, it is a total disappointment. The food for me was very heavy, oily with a lot of sauces. They are very authentic but not for my palette. Service is very good, staff professional, prices reasonable, scenery and atmosphere beautiful.
5
My second trip to National Kitchen at the National Gallery. Us 5 gals all agreed that this restaurant continue to garner our votes for most authentic Peranakan food in a beautiful setting. Coupled with the very attentive and knowledgeable staff who were able to recommend dishes that go together makes the meal great, we were so lucky to be able to also meet up with Chef Violet Oon. Very humble yet well spoken lady and very friendly.Kudos for the great job, keep up the sterling efforts, Best Peranakan food and bet of all, No Msg - msg- mono sodium glutamate added. Fantastic work
4
I've always been a big fan of Peranakan food and having lived with a Peranakan family for few years my tastebuds are picky when Peranakan cuisine is concerned. The whole experience in the restaurant was great. From the very colonial-Peranakan fusion decor (love the tiles and wood paneling), the customised cutlery with VO branding, and the delicious food. The dry laksa noodles is a must try, and the buak kelua noodles is a nice twist from the traditional chicken dish. The beef rendang is so tender almost melts in your mouth. Their home made soda and dessert is nothing to rave about but I'm really happy with the main dishes. They really do it well this time.
5
As soon as the waiting staff took the lid off the earthen pot, we knew we were in for a treat. The scent rising out with the steam - so aromatic, it was almost effervescent. The flavour was so rich - many, many layered. People talk so often and very lightly about 'umami', but this is the perfect description for this perfect dish. I was a tad excited and as I started into the pot with a pair of chop sticks and a fork, I slashed my wife sitting opposite with the sauce. The staff was right on hand, providing us both with paper bibs, normally reserved for chilli crabs. We did look ridiculous sitting there all dressed up for our anniversary celebration, wearing paper bibs, but we did not care. The fish was beautifully tender - sweet and delicate. Best fish head curry we have ever had.P.S. The whole concept of fish head anything might be off putting for some people. My wife was one of those people. But, once you realise what delicacy you are missing out on - you will keep going back for more. In fact, all the bones are relatively big - it is easy to separate flesh from the bone so that you don't end up with a mouthful of bones
5
We loved every single thing about our dining experience at National Kitchen. We simply had mid-day kopi and desserts. But the service was excellent and the food and drinks even better. We will definitely be going back for dinner, and it will become a definite suggestion for visiting friends and family as well.
5
If you want to enjoy a wonderfully decadent setting, hospitable service, high quality food and flavoursome local cuisine - this is your place. I had a spare hour after a long week of business here and ducked in. Having visited six mths prior with my wife, we fell in love with this restaurant - it had everything we love. Vaj (maitre d) welcomed me, found me a table and made me feel at home. Helping with the menu and even bringing over a complimentary serve of their famous satay. It is hands down the best satay chicken I've ever had!I then ordered the beef rendang, a world beater. Slowly cooked so the beef melts in your mouth, and the spices soak completely into the meat. Filled with flavour and just decadent. You can't beat this...try it out you won't be disappointed..
4
If you are looking for nice ambience restaurant serving peranakan food, then violet onn is a place to consider.
As for food, the redang is good. Not forgetting the dessert is yummy
5
Had a wonderful lunch here. What a beautiful restaurant, which fits perfectly in the surroundings of the National Gallery. The Peranakan inspired food was delicious. The Daging Chabek beef cheek was especially good.
Would definitely recommend a visit!
3
Lunch there at 2pm on Saturday, some popular food sold out already, still a good place to chilled out with friends
5
Mum and daughter are together the perfect hosts and made us all feel as if we were dining with friends of many years.
5
On entering the restaurant I was immediately impressed by the entrance hall, the interior, the heavy looking furniture and the table setting too.It felt luxurious, classic. Then looking at the menu, all the dishes described looked so tempting, not knowing what I should order? Of course I ordered Singapore Laksa, but it was prepared dried. When I tested it, it was super delicioso! A must try! My colleages ordered: Chicken Rice (it was ok), Satay (recommended! must have!), Meatless Beef Balls (for the vegetarian lady). It so happened everyone was happy with their choice.I had banana smoothie with gula Malaka. This is recommended too! This place is more for social, not for a sit alone kind of place
5
Located in an iconic building in Singapore, its great place to dine to taste authentic local Nyonya dishes. The service was attentive and you wouldn't be disappointed with the food too. The alfresco area provides a great view to Marina Bay. Book highly recommended as it is very popular with locals and tourists
4
We had a party of 10 for dinner and the restaurant didn't disappoint us. We brought foreign guests for dinner and they were impressed by the quality and variety of dishes. The waiters were very professional and courteous. The table was a slightly cramped and we were squished together - but other than that, the ambience was great. Food is very good (though not out-of-this-world) and would come back here again to bring out-of-towners etc
4
We ate outside, on the terrace, so had a great view of the Marina Sands complex, as the sun set. I had the gado gado, and found it a little too spicy. My wife had the Hakka Abacus Beads, and was a little disappointed with it. The worst aspect of the meal was the loud music, piped into a speaker beside our table. We asked our waitress TWICE if she could turn it down, and she eventually did
3
Came here for High Tea which cost approx. SGD65/- per set (for 2 pax). The restaurant is located on the 2nd level of the National Gallery and serves Peranakan cuisine.There is no doubt the decor is posh and ambience great. But the food served as part of High Tea set is just average and hence it's definitely overpriced.
4
I love Peranakan food, and the food served by this restaurant is the best one I've tried ever. I'm no Peranakan, by the way, so I don't have many chances to eat home-made Peranakan meals. First, the ambiance here makes you feel so comfortable and at home. The place is a little small, so reservation is encouraged. The food, such as kueh pie tee, hakka abacus beads, dry laksa and buah keluak ayam, are extremely tasty, though they may be a little too salty. It would be good, if the saltiness can be reduced slightly, as you might feel thirsty for the whole night subsequently
5
The place is just gorgeous: the atmosphere, the artwork, the dishes. And then you have the staff: friendly and smiling.
Thanks Saad for the nice recommendation! I loved my dessert and coffee!
5
This is an absolutely fantastic restaurant top notch friendly service fantastic food nice presentation and certainly great value for money absolutely a must try when in Singapore
5
My daughters and I had a great time at the restaurant. Such authentic flavours. The interior decor of the place made it cosy too.
5
I was amazed when I walked in just how small, but beautiful the restaurant is. The waiters were lovely, and made the night very enjoyable. We had just flown over from London, and were a bit frazzled, but the sight of a good and affordable wine menu, and having a waiter help my husband who doesn't deal too well with spicy food meant that the meal was perfect. At one point we had a dish put on our table, by a passing waiter, which we knew wasn't ours. We caught someones eye almost instantly and explained this. The manager then came over and apologised, and explained that due to christmas the tables were set out in a different lay out. He also said that the dish was now ours, as you can't show someone tasty food and then take it away:) He was correct the plate was gorgeous.When we are back in Singapore we will definitely be coming back
4
I went to National Kitchen last week with friends while on vacation in Singapore. The restaurant is tucked inside the national gallery and you can peruse the gallery late into the evening. The restaurant has great decor and incredibly accommodating staff (I had no reservation on a Saturday night and they were willing to accommodate my group of four). The menu offers local specials including Malaysian, Indian, and Chinese cuisine. The apps were large portions and delicious but we were somewhat disappointed in our mains-the eggplant and fish were well cooked, but they were based in the same chilly sauce that was too spicy for us to eat. If you have any issues with spice I would flag it for them in advance Desserts were also large portions and attractive. The regional delicacies weren't necessarily my thing but were extremely well done regardless.
4
Great looking place , nice and cosy decorated like a old mans club. Food is as it's says in the tin but just tastes wonderful . Very specific food read up on it before you go, you will be surprised how good it tastes. Great menu and a good wine selection if not a bit pricey , but that's Singapore s sin tax doing its job. Service is super efficient and friendly . A must for all. You have to book sadly way in advance but very worth it. The building has been so beautifully maintained its dream walking up to the restaurant !Don't miss this one
5
National kitchen is housed in Singapore's National Gallery and faces the Padang. As the restaurant is small and has limited seating, reservations in advance is highly recommended! We tried to make a resevation in late Dec and the earliest slot that was available was a week later on NYE's. It was a nice spot for NYE's dinner. The food is delicious and the service is excellent. All the waiters were extremely friendly and highly attentive to our needs. We tried the salted duck soup, satay, Assam fish and dry mee siam. It slipped our minds to request for less spicy dishes and the spicy dishes turned out to be rather intense! Definitely not for the faint hearted! We also ordered two desserts, roti jala and kueh beng kah. We wanted to try the kueh dah dah but unfortunately, it wasn't available. The kuehs and the accompanying gula melaka sauce didn't disappoint at all, so we would probably return to try the high tea set one day
4
This restaurant is something out of the ordinary. Tucked away in the National Gallery, it's actually a bit hard to find. There are no big signs outside, so you need to know what you're looking for. The ambiance of the restaurant is cosy, kind of like a French Bistro. The staff was very service minded and helped us to put together a menu of different courses to give us a nice experience
5
This restaurant is a walking contradiction! Completely over the top, yet cozy and personal. Nestled in a National Gallery, yet intimate and friendly. Elegant, yet boisterous. It's amazing. I want to eat here every night. Chili crab forever! I would highly recommend this restaurant. Start with their spin on the Singapore Sling. Have the Nyonya Archar, and of course the chili crab. And don't miss the Kueh Dah Dah for dessert. Please take me back soon
5
Recommended to try this place by an expat working in Singapore. It is well off the beaten track inside the National Gallery. Very nice place, lovely decor and ambiance and very nice staff. We were both vegetarian for the evening and had "meatless meatballs". Really very good
5
Meatless meatballs rendang are to die for. I swap to vegetarian sambal as I don't like the fishy flavour of the normal sambal.
5
all the dishes we ordered were v well executed - gado gado, kueh pai ti, cod in laksa sauce, abacus, meatless roll.... the kueh pai ti was esp good. will definitely pay it a second visit in the very near future.
5
Make a reservation ahead of your meal as this place tends to get booked up pretty fast. The dishes were tasty and the service was great. Portions could be bigger but the ambiance makes up for it.

Food is really good and the service staff are excellent with good product knowledge. Good place to have peranakan food.
5
as titled. have recommended it to friends and will definitely return to try more dishes. the portions are slightly on the small side.

Warm and elegant deco, warm and friendly service, yummy food. Great location and ambience in the National Gallery of Singapore.

I was warned that this restaurant was going to be very touristy and not necessarily a true representation of Peranakan cuisine, so I was apprehensive but I still wanted to try it, as we have previously visited other similar restaurants when in Singapore and I wanted to branch out a bit. The room is just gorgeous and this is half of the experience of the meal (although finding it can be a bit tricky in this humungous space!). But the food was also very good, and well priced (for Singapore). The rendang just fell apart on the fork and it was beautifully spiced. My favourite main dish was the baked cod with laksa sauce, which was a small portion of fish but the lightness AND depth of the sauce was amazing. While the eggplant sambal was good in itself, it was probably too similar to the rendang - with a very rich sauce - and we could have chosen a lighter vegetable dish. The entree of Kuay Pie Tee was simply AMAZING and one of the best things I have eaten in this part of the world. Little pastry cups of turnip and bamboo shoots (ending up a bit like caramelised onions) with a prawn on top, served with a hot chilli relish and a sweeter but still spicy sauce that you mix together with the KPT and eat in one deliciously complex bite!The only disappointment was the very small wine list and the fact that the one sparkling that they offered had run out the night we visited. We ended up with a very drinkable and light Chianti which went well with the food but a bigger selection would have been appreciated. We are keen to go here again next time we are in town and order a whole range of different dishes, so that says something! While it may not be 'authentic' enough to satisfy the very fussy Singaporean purists, I have to say that the combination of solid, well spiced and quite lovingly prepared food, in a gorgeous setting, for a reasonable price ($210 USD for two) is pretty good in my books

My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary here and we love it. Food was great. Service was excellent especially by Siraj the restaurant manager! Ambience of course was superb with many photo opportunities to celebrate our anniversary. Really worth a visit for lunch, high tea or dinner and throw in a visit to the national gallery to make it an awesome day !

Located on the 2nd floor of the National Gallery, one need only ask the gallery staff to be pointed in the right direction. Once there, this intimate restaurant impresses with its decor. Dark tiles on its walls and chandeliers on its ceiling give it a classy feel.Dinner was a salad, starter, jasmine rice and 2 mains (a meat and a vegetable) and the portions are large enough for two persons. The dishes come heavily laced with spices. Our starter was the dried chicken mixed with a creamy curry sauce and it came served in a wonton cup (a right choice). Another pleasant choice was the beef rendang. I do not usually take beef but I wanted to try Violet's and I did not regret it. It was so tender it literally tore apart when I put my spoon and fork to it. Kudos to the kitchen staff.We ended the meal on a sweet note with the pineapple upside down cake (once again, large enough for two). It came highly recommended and rightly so. The sponge cake was soft to the touch and it was not too sweet. I would have preferred if table napkins were offered to patrons as opposed to paper napkins. But if is going to be just paper napkins, may I suggest getting thicker and better quality ones.Price-wise, it may be a tad high but given the location and care and attention in its service...I looked pass it.
5
Singapore cuisine done properly and accorded the respect it deserves. We've been here a few times and the food is consistently excellent. Ms Oon doesn't compromise on the spice levels so be warned.Beautiful decor and warm service.One minor problem is that we always end up ordering the same dishes that we love: the beef cheek rendang, bastador, kueh pie tee, satay and sambal fish... we'll will ourselves to other items on the menu next time
4
Service was impeccable. Food tasted very good. Ambiance was a mix of Peranakan and Western influences. Great place to bring a date for non-formal dinner.
4
We prefer the savoury dishes over the sweet ones. Most of the sweet items from the hightea set is really good too.
5
A refined and authentic Peranakan menu, professional service and a lovely dining ambience made this the perfect place for my birthday celebration. Will definitely be back.
4
Nice interior d√©cor, small and cosy. The food was delicious and the staff were very friendly. Will return again.
5
National Kitchen is like stepping back in time, to be clear, to a good place in time. When restaurants didn't take your order via ipad, but instead the waiter shared with you their thoughts on what they think are the best dishes on the menu and took pride in telling you how fabulous it is.I loved every second of being in that restaurant, from start to finish - the food was great, service impeccable and the decor is charming. We will be going back.
4
Nice decor and great ambience. Excellent service and staff was very friendly. May have to order 2 portions for groups beyond 4. Sayuh Lodeh was too thick for our liking but the Kueh Pie Tee was excellent. The beef Rendang and fried Fish was very good too. For dessert, we liked the pulut Hitam with ice cream and the Kueh Dadah was brilliant.
5
Super amazing beef rendang, fish head curry, ngoh hiang, butter prawn, meatless meatballs rendang!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è The turmeric chicken wings were too salty though. Love the chandeliers and the over-all ambiance of the place plus the excellent service. In my 4 months of living in Singapore this is so far my most favorite resto.
5
It is pretty difficult to book this restaurant. So please book two weeks in advance if you are keen. There are a few surprises when I reached the restaurant. It is a lot smaller than I thought but the deco is a mixed of strong colonial and some peranakan outlay onto it. the small ambience make the place a little tight but that does not take away the fact that it is a very nice setting.The telephone booking and the initial insistence of opening the restaurant at exactly 12 noon created some annoyance among some customers who were there waiting. Not exactly a good initial impression from me at the beginning  Throughout the 2 hours of lunch, my perception of this restaurant shifted from being annoyed to very impressed. Food and Service are tops here. Yes, it is Nonya.. the food quality is authentic as it can be... very nonya yet with some updated use of spices. What I really like the Beef rending (tasted different from blue bali), the fried fish (according to my family... it was amazing), Sayoh lodeh is good as it added a good sprinkle of coconut flakes... Yes, I know this dish is not for everyone.. but I virtually finished it... the petai.... (Chinese translated it as smelly beans) but it was awesome. The beans were not too hard or soft yet crunchy enough. kueh pai kee is good though not as good as true blue's (mind you that True Blue is a lot more costly). If you love spicy food, national kitchen offers different choices of spicy dishes. I have to add a word of appreciation for the service staff as they tops the experience with their wonderful service attitude. A best practice for good restaurant service in Singapore. I can only wish that their telephone customer service can been better and be abit more flexible with their opening hours instead and be less insistent on opening at exactly 12noon or 6pm.Prices are reasonable considering the restaurant is located in the national gallery which is another very historic building. Worth it.

When I made the reservation, I specifically requested for something special to be done as it was my sister's birthday. A day before my visit, one of Violet Oon's staff emailed me to confirm my reservation and pointed out that she would make it a memorable meal for my sister's birthday. Nothing memorable about this meal. No one had wished my sister's happy birthday throughout the entire visit there even though, all the staff were happily singing happy birthday to another table. I waited for them to do something special or even just wish her happy birthday, or put a candle on the desserts I've ordered, but nothing was done. Food was borderline mediocre, portions were okay but nothing was exceptional tasty.A very disappointing meal overall
4
Went there for dinner on the spur of the moment. As we did not make a reservation, we sat by the bar. As the place is not really big, it fills up quite fast, so always make a reservation.The food was good. Really enjoyed the cod and ayam buak keluak. Service was prompt, and food was served quite fast even though it was quite packed. However, it was quite noisy when we were there. Overall, good value for money, especially for Gallery insiders who get a 15% discount. Will definitely go back again soon
5
The National Kitchen is my go-to place for fab Peranakan food in a lovely setting!! The service standards seem to have dropped slightly though; the staff used to be more personal & attentive.
5
We keep coming back to this wonderful little restaurant, bringing family and friends new to Singapore. It's a great place to introduce visitors and ppl who just love great food.
4
Very nice decor and vibrant atmosphere.
Food is similar to what you can find at the hawker stands but fancier. Service was a little slow for the price point. The mantou dish was a standout dish.
3
There are more affordable and better Peranakan food out there. This is just a place with good atmosphere
5
the legendary hospitality of Violet Oon is always so welcoming.
The menu has even improved, even if difficult, in the choice and taste.
A very special place to bring your friends either locals of ovreseas, to discover Paranakan food. and heritage.
5
Service was great, ambience amazing and food especially the dry laksa and desserts were amazing. Kueh pie tie as a starter was great too!
5
This place takes no prisoners. You'll be lucky to get a table, so make an effort to book as soon as you know you're heading to the city.Extremely attentive service, and food to match. In fact even veggies will come away feeling good about the place. Based in the National Gallery, you may find yourself lost and wondering around the building wondering if there is even a restaurant there to visit. But there is and you'll be well received if you're bothered to book.Characterful environment with some neat little booths if you prefer your privacy. I good wine selection for those who want something special
3
Ambience was great and it was full house when we dined on a Monday night for dinner but extremely noisy as such so not a place for a romantic dinner.Food portions were very small for the price of the dishes and for some reason my guests and I found the dishes were extremely salty like the dry laksa, chap chye and the beef rendang. We had to order rice as the saltiness was too overpowering. The appetisers were good and decent portions such as the ngoh hiang and tumuric chicken wings. Order dessert which was roti jala with gula melaka and banana sauce but again very small portion and only 2 slices of banana which was in the sauce, somehow we had an interpretation there would be fresh bananas laid on top but not so.Wouldn't recommend guests who have lived overseas and are used to larger portions like in USA or Australia unless you order alot of dishes to share.Unfortunately, unlikely to come again
5
 To all tourist and visitors, I would recommend dining at National Kitchen to complete the visit to the National Gallery. From the ambience to the details of the culinary arts all demonstrate the unique Peranakan culture. In the process of ordering the experience staffs were very confident to recommend on the dishes and also able to advise on the appropriate quantity.
4
I went there for dinner with friends and we had a great time at the restaurant. Staffs were supportive and gave us great services. We had two starters, two main course (one meat, one seafood) , three desserts and a bottle of wine. That costs about SGD 300. The food were genuinely great in both presentation and taste. Personally, I think Starters and Desserts worth much better than main course because we ordered Fish Head Curry which came with a small piece of fish and few pieces of vegetables. Other than that I'm happy with the service and food of this restaurant
4
Overall a great experience with superb service. The ambience is terrific. Enjoyed the pulot hitam with coconut ice cream.
4
Probably the best Peranakan afternoon tea in town. 56++ per two person set, with unlimited coffee or tea. Staff were helpful but service was a bit slow because staff were hugely outnumbered by guests.
3
There is no rating between "Average" and "Very Good". Hence I have no choice to give "Average" ratings for most items.
5
Extremely personal, helpful and dedicated crew here at Violet Oon National Kitchen. we came here to celebrate a birthday, and the crew remembered it after being told once, with each crew member who served us greeted happy birthday wishes. Even the preparation of cakes were done by the crew - lighting of candles to bringing the cake up to our desk; all these i didnt ask for, but the crew went beyond their extra mile to complete the dinner. They even surprised us when they printed our photos and gave it to us on the spot, this surprise came after me requesting for crew's help to take a photo for us. This was the best restaurant i've been in SG that truely represents the epitome of excellent service. Kudos to the crew who were on duty on 16 Dec. :
4
The high-tea set for two (56SGD) features local savoury and sweet items paired with the restaurant's own blend of tea leaves. What makes the experience special are the nicely-appointed interiors and its location (within the stately National Gallery). Nice place in which to catch up with good friends, or with a date
4
The resturant is very tastefully done up. Food was presented very nicely too. While the prices are not everyday affordable, it was worth it for the occasional treat. However, service was lacklustre. Our reservation was at noon, the service staff ignored us when we tried to enter (door was locked) 5 mins before noon. No acknowledgement even though they saw us. Ordered a dessert that was supposed to come with ice cream. Wasn't informed that they ran out of ice cream, not even when served. Who would willingly pay full price for half a dessert?
2
My wife booked a table and was given the choice of a twelve o‚Äôclock sitting or a later sitting at two p.m. She chose the later sitting and we arrived on time. The initial reception by a black-coated staff member and a pleasant waitress was good. We were seated and our orders taken, drinks brought and we sat enjoying the ambience. A third staff member served my starter however; as there was no sign of my wife‚Äôs starter we decided to share. It was a delicious ngoh hiang. We had finished my starter by the time my wife‚Äôs order arrived, delivered by a fourth member of staff who then walked away. I managed to attract the attention of yet another staff member to ask for clean plates. I was surprised that I had to ask given the high standards laid out in the restaurant‚Äôs on-line promotion. We shared her average quality rojak, decided to order more drinks however, there were no staff members in sight. An almost completely new squad then came on duty and the service deteriorated significantly. Our mains arrived, again unremarkable quality but when we finished eating we sat for quite a time with a table covered in dirty dishes. I asked a passing waiter to clear them away which he did so in a sullen fashion. Another staff member in a black coat came over to our table and my wife asked for the ladies toilet. The reply she received was a blunt, ‚ÄúOutside‚Äù, following, which, the staff member turned and walked away. Yet another waiter came to hand my wife a ‚Äòcoffee‚Äô menu before slapping a second menu down in front of me saying the single word, ‚ÄúDesserts‚Äù and then walking away. We decided to finish our meal elsewhere and paid the bill. This is neither a restaurant we intend to visit again nor one that I would recommend

The restaurant was located at the second floor of the museum in the City Hall wing. The place was decorated in blacks. The place was fully booked for a Friday lunch time, but I managed to get a table through walk in. The place was packed for lunch.Buah Keluak Ayam ($23++)Classic nyonya spicy and tangy chicken stew and buah keluak nut infused with fresh root spices of lengkuas and turmericThe nut was filled with rich creamy filling, which can be dig out easily by a teaspoon. The chicken was tender and easily tear apart.Fish Head Curry ($42) Red snapper fish head stewed in an aromatic curry of cumin, fennel, chilies, turmeric and onions with tomatoes, baby eggplants and okraThe curry was the indian version. It tasted quite spicy at first, but one ate more it became quite smooth and rich in taste. Although the serving looked small, the fish head packed lots of chunky meat in it.Chap Chye ($15++)Classic nyonya festive dish of braised mixed vegetables and bean curd skin in a rich prawn bisqueThe sauce was savoury but it was lacking of the dried shrimps which was usually associated with the dish and the vegetables would be better if braised until soft. The vegetables was still crunchy.We have the dishes with Chicken rice rice ($3++) and Nasi lemak rice ($2++), which was oily and flavourful on it own
5
Dining room well lightly and elegant. The highlight is the food a culinary delight. Well plated, tasty, every bite sends a mixture of taste that mixed very well with my taste buds. Had Chili Crabs wow was it hot, fried tofu the sauce on top of the tofu nailed it a perfect combination. We also order some form of ground pork cake and vegetable spring rolls. Love this restaurant. Definitely 5 star ambiance and food quality. I will be back and try the other food in their menu.
4
My wife and I visited the National Gallery and popped in for high tea at 3 pm (have to make reservation to avoid disappointment). The service was excellent, environment was conducive for slow afternoon conversation and the food was uniquely Peranakan (Straits-born) with tapas portions of Malay desserts as well as saltish delicacies, and I loved the free flow servings of local coffee. The price was not exorbitant, so all in all a very delightful setting for high tea. It's location is excellent, as one can spend time both before and after the high tea to enjoy viewing the exhibits at the Gallery (free of charge for Singaporeans). Great way to spend a birthday or wedding anniversary in-country
3
Was delighted to bring my Taiwanese friend to try out their afternoon tea. However the server that was attending to us gave us a black and poker face the whole time. Making my friend feeling very uncomfortable
4
Thanks for the wonderful experience. We are glad to have visited VO restaurant and the food was authentically prepared. The taste and smell are aromatic.
Thanks!!!
5
Ambience is excellent! Very good Peranakan food n impeccable service....highly recommended! Must try
3
We try the kueh pie tee,rojak,ngio hiong,curry fish head,chap chye and satay.Only the satay and curry fish head is nice.Their service is good,staffs are friendly and nice.That day my daughter birthday they complimentary her a small pineapple cake.
5
We had lunch at Violet Oons and were not disappointed. The decor was fantastic, the music relaxing and the cocktails delicious! The food was even better with the chicken satay being the best we had ever tasted. I had the beef cheek and it was melt in your mouth tender and so full of flavour. Would definitely recommend this place and would love to return
5
We stopped into this popular place for a late lunch and were not disappointed. The decor is lovely, and service is attentive. The chicken satay appetizer is large enough to be a meal and was outstanding. We had a couple of Singaporean entries that were both quite good. The cocktails were also well made and presented. If the restaurant is fully booked online, give them a call to see if they can accommodate you.
4
I came to National Kitchen on an arranged dinner for 16. We had a set menu so I checked ahead and it had most of the 'recommended' dishes. I'll start with the positives, the beer was nice and the wine was decent. The food arrived quickly and the staff were very pleasant. The food however was very very heavily flavoured, whether it was thick sauce or a spicy sauce. Unfortunately I struggled with every dish except the Kuay Pie Tee and a fish tempura. If you like spicey or heavily flavoured food give it a shot for the ambience
5
National Kitchen by Violet Oon is one of the best kept treasures in the Singapore National Gallery. After taking in the art scene, visit this restaurant and enjoy Peranakan food prepared really well. Service is also great and the place has a fine dining feel without the fine dining price
5
Very clean, comfortable, cosy, warm, elegant dinning place for family, friends, colleagues (i.e. Home Affairs) and dignitaries and foreign guests (i.e. Foreign Affairs) to our local cuisine and food. Warm waiteressing services. One piece of information / suggestion for consideration upon observation from visit on 27/11/16: Young children may not be able to take hot and spicy food as yet. Perhaps have two options of kids' set meals. If kids have not the right food to eat, they are restless and may be noisy / crying and parents need to manage kids and will not be able to enjoy. Other guests get distracted too with the crying of toddlers..
4
A weekend back in Singapore is not complete without a meal at Violet Oons. I choose the National Kitchen as I had not visited that location and was not disappointed. Beautiful and very similar to Bukit Timah. We were a couple and chose 3 main dishes, Beef cheek, fish head curry and meatless meatballs. Beautiful. Ample servings and left enough for a dessert to share. Great service although a little noisy sitting next to a large table. Violet Oon remains a Favourite!
5
Beautiful setting and restaurant, excellent service and the most delicious food and wine. A splendid evening of celebration. Special thanks to Yogi for taking such great care of us.
Look forward to returning
.
4
The staffs were very friendly except for the lady at the reception.She had that grumpy face that almost chased us away from dining in.However,in order not to spoil my friend's birthday celebration,we just stayed for our meals.The food were very tasty but pricey.
3
The ambience and unique location is refreshing. However, food was average. We get better Rojak in any food center!
5
Restaurant staff are very friendly and helpful. Few dishes that are a must-try: kueh pie tee, satay, dry laksa, ngio hiong. Staff will always be ready to recommend!
4
Eating here the 2nd time. The satay and beef rendang are my favorites! Staffs are knowledageable and makes good recommendations . Overall a pleasant experience!
5
What a wonderful experience at The National Kitchen. Wonderful local, Peranakan food. Enjoyed all my favourite dishes like beef rendang, Chilli prawn, kuay pie tie and so much more. The nasi Lemak is so lemak (coconutty) it's so awesome. Wonderful environment, comfortable, classy, lovely settings packaged with attentive and friendly service. If you are looking for a perfect night out for a special occasion or for business, this is the perfect restaurant.
5
This takes the favours of Peranakan food to a different level.Beef cheek rendang was phenomenal.....fresh and so succulent. Petai prawns that you have never tasted before. Assam fish, Ayam bukula were fantastic.Desserts of Pulau Hitam and the pineapple upside down cake were not sweet and had great flavours.Will be coming back to try the rest of the menu
4
The decor and setup of The National Kitchen is highly elegant with a matching ambiance presented by the staff. We tried a variety of items from Satay to Beef Cheeks to Hainanese Chicken Rice and personally, although the quality of the food is good, it lacked a bit of depth and authenticity. Though in contrast, the one dessert that we had; Pulot Hitam was amazing and recommended
4
Whatever you eat, you must leave space to try the kueh Beng Kah - moist, fragrant and delectable! It's a grated tapioca cake served with gula Melaka and rich coconut milk. My other big favourite was the very unique Hakka abacus beads. I don't think this is served in many places. Delicious dumplings with a tasty mix of dried shrimp, mushrooms, bean curd and more. The dry Mee Siam was very spicy so beware if you can't take spicy food. Service was somewhat slow and ambience was noisy though there is an olde world charm with the decor.
5
Always on the lookout for a good laksa and local fare in Singapore and happened upon The National Kitchen based on others reviews. Food was amazing and so were the cocktails. Highly recommend the Chicken and PrawnBostador and the Daging Chabek Beef Cheek. They do book out a week ahead so make a reservation well in advance
5
We went for lunch and could not have asked for better food or service. Would definitely return. Highly recommended.
4
Quite pricey but Violet Oon's "dry" laksa (not the usual coconut milk spicy gravy) is the most flavorful in town. Lovely decor - cozy yet classy.
5
Beef rendang was perfect. Price wise is at the low side given its location. Portion of starter is huge. Serice could be improved.
2
Taste, ambience, service was all spot on. However rather disturbed by fact that both of us got the runs the next day. Something wasn't exactly clean, not sure what.
5
It was a lovely lunch. Staff went out of their way to Ensure it was great. We even got a compli dessert and a photograph taken and placed in a personalised Violet Oon frame.
5
I tried something new this time: gado gado starter -- which was huge, for the two of us. Delicious peanut sauce. Beef rendang as good as ever, possibly better -- the rempah was mouth watering good, the meat pull apart tender. Dry laksa remains a star.
5
We took our German guests for authentic local food sans the hurly-burly of going to big bustling seafood joints. As vegetarians, we had checked with the restaurant, and they had assured us that the staff would assist proactively in choice of dishes and quantity needed.They were true to their word and advised us on dishes, quantity, spice level etc. The food was excellent,both the seafood as well as the vegetarian dishes, some are outright vegetarian and others like the eggplant have veg options. The restaurant is furnished very tastefully,perhaps a bit too ornate but then it is in Singapore's new crown jewel , the National Gallery.As the restaurant is comparatively small, noise levels are high but that is not a problem we just spoke a little louder. Prices are reasonable though drinks are overpriced ($20++ for a pint of beer)
4
I have been to the National Kitchen restaurant at National Gallery twice and this has become one of my places to go for good food and nice ambience. Service was good too. This is a popular place. So do make reservations early, especially for their weekend afternoon tea
5
Having a Peranakan grandmother means my standards for Peranakan food are quite high. National Kitchen meets and exceeds my expectations. The best dish there in my opinion is their Ngor Hiang which is crispy, flavourful, and loaded with prawns! For desserts, their Kueh Beng Kah is heavy and sweet. The decor of the place gives a very homey, comfortable, and intimate ambiance
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our meal last night. The ambience was perfect, this is obviously a destination for celebrations such the staff are very skilled at ensuring everyone has a special time. The food was Asian with Care fro Violet, all dishes were high quality which encourages experimentation. It was refreshing to have rice charged at its true (monetary) value $1! Book because it is so popular
3
Rojak is superb. Food presentation is great. Very friendly staff. Food average. Nice restaurant for hosting guests.
4
Lovely ambience and great location in national gallery. I had the Utah keluak noodles - quite tasty but a little monotonous as a one dish meal. Pricey. Otherwise a very nice dining experience. I would recommend and return.
1
Overhyped. Food was delivered promptly but portions were small and the dishes weren't cooked well. You could taste the rawness of the condiments.
Won't be going back. Better utilise your money elsewhere.
5
After a walk around the gallery the salad was really good. Tender beef on a salad bed. Nice light and airy environment.
5
Great local food with a fine-dining twist, but not so much of a twist that it becomes unrecognizable, excllent service as well
4
Brought some out-of-towners here to try Peranakan food. The food was well executed, service was attentive without being pushy, and the ambience (the restaurant as well as, of course, the National Gallery) was lovely. 5 of us shared a couple of starters, 4 mains, 5 desserts and all had coffee and tea after that. It came up to under S$50 a head, which I thought was fine, all things considered
4
We are no experts, but it was clear that the dishes we tried had been created with great loyalty to their origins. The core ingredients were top notch, the spices well-blended and the presentation mouthwatering. The room is atmospheric and the service was good. This resturant is well worth a visit - with the bonus of a look at the superb new(ish) National Gallery
5
one of many things that I miss about Peranakan Food - after work, hang out with friends for good local food. Violet Oon @ National Gallery, served excellent authentic Peranakan food, the service was excellent, having a brilliant restaurant manager ( Mr. Rajoo, he welcome his customers with smile and open arms and as well his crew members. I speak for many, when we say Violet Oon has so much to offer for that quintessential Peranakan experience. To all tourist if you ever visit National Gallery , one of the many places must try, Violet Oon . You don't want to miss it
5
Ticks all the boxes: great tasting Peranakan food in regal old world charm ambiance, with fantastic service. Altogether a great Singapore experience not only for Singaporeans but tourists.We had the following:Salted vegetables with duck soupKuay pie teeAyam buah keluakUdang goreng chilliJu hee charKueh dah dahPulot hitam with coconut ice creamKuey beng kah (a surprise birthday cake)What made me really like this place is how they keep to their Peranakan food heritage. The recipes are authentic and spice level never brought down to suit tourists nor those who can't take spicy food (sorry). That's why you'll see as many locals as tourists here. You'll feel like you've stepped back in time into a grandiose resturant back in time during the days of Singapore's British rule. Yet it's got that nice balance of casual, cozy feel.The service: love the balance shown by the staff. When to leave you alone and when to attend. When they attend to you you'll feel quite special as they'll fuss over you. The team here is made up of knowledgeable matured gentlemen who knows their menu and food. You can't go wrong asking for a recommendation. Will go back again to try the other dishes. Will recommend this. Thereafter a treat to the National Gallery...why not
5
I loved The National Kitchen as soon as I walked through the doors. Greeted by an old world charm and an attentive friendly host, we were whisked away to our reserved table (rez req'd) in the middle of a room framed by black and white tiles, gold sconce's and emerald adorned walls. The wait staff was attentive and quick and the manager gave a friendly hello. Singapore's most signature cuisine is showcased in tasty renditions of flavorful dishes
4
This is my 2nd time to eat at National kitchen by violet oon. Quality of food and service is always impressive. Especially staffs are professional and efficient.
4
Nice food, good ambience with attentive service! We find the background music just a little loud though!
4
Food was very tasty and authentic although portions were pretty small. Service was genuine, attentive yet unobtrusive. Ambience was cosy and relaxed. Enjoyable experience. Will come again!
3
Service is good, ambient is good but the dry laksa is relatively salty.. Staffs are friendly and nice
5
Afternoon tea in a splendid setting with friendly and attentive service. The restaurant is hidden away upstairs in the National Gallery on Coleman St. The selection of savoury and sweet items was both interesting and tasty and we enjoyed everything except the coffee which was a little sweet and too milky for my wife. If you want a different take on the local food of Singapore you must come here. The room is Art Deco elegant and the staff are very well trained. A wonderful experience
5
My husband and I dined here on our anniversary and couldn't have been happier. The food was excellent, and the service attentive. We received a complimentary dessert in celebration of our anniversary, and a picture of us was nicely framed and presented. We will definitely be back in future.
5
An excellent restaurant. Food and service are first rate. Better than a number of restaurants which have found there way into Michelin Guide and been awarded rosettes.This was my second visit. The first was marked by being taken by surprise and second by the restaurant living up to a very high expectation. The standout dish on both occasions was the dry laksa
5
Been to many many restaurants over the past year, The National Kitchen is the best! Big call but well deserved, serving Singapore staple foods perfectly presented and having an attentive but not "fake" staff the whole meal is a pleasure. So if you want to try traditional Singapore food and don't mind paying a little more for quality then u must try this place. Exquisite from start to finish!
5
If you're bored like me with the usual English afternoon tea or the local style afternoon tea, try the peranakan style afternoon tea at National Kitchen. Immaculate food coupled with outstanding tea collections that are not avail in other place. Service is top notch and ambience is simply 'atas' (elegant)
5
Came here on the last night and Singapore and it didn't disappoint. The service is excellent, the decor is on point and the food is top notch. Highly recommend for anyone wanting a good meal whether you're a tourist or a local. Make sure you make a reservation

The food was really just so so you could not justify the price ( I got the most expensive item on the menu). Give it a miss.
3
Reservation was done promptly. I have indicated that we will be celebrating 2 birthdays and staff did confirmed my request too. But nothing was done on that day.
2
Staff were aloof and didn't remember our requests! Don't even bother to confirm our orders.

This restaurant is aesthetically beautiful, with an opulent feel with green walls and chandeliers unlike anything I have experienced in Singapore. The wait staff are impeccable, provide good direction and provide excellent service - which is a feat in Singapore.But this is all about the food. The duck soup with mustard greens was warming with right amount of heat; the beef rendang was rich and well balanced; and the tiny cups filled with pickled vegetables dainty and delicious.Even the local coffee (kopi) was lovely. Looking forward to my next meal

Made a reservation for two, indicated it was for my husband's birthday. Got a call two days before the reservation date to confirm the reservation and at the same time to inform me that there were a few big group reservations and as such the noise level would be higher than usual. I thought that was a nice touch and was appreciative of the notice given. The food itself was very good - tasty and the portions were generous. I was even more impressed with the service, friendly and helpful staff who were always ready to help, and ready with a smile. I queried whether the correct rice was served - chicken rice instead of nasi lemak, and they kindly brought a bowl of the former for me to compare. They brought out a complimentary slice of birthday cake for my husband and took a photo of us and printed and framed the same for us to keep as a souvenir of the evening. In particular, Yogis was such a lovely, warm and helpful host. So whilst as peranakan food goes, it's not the most cheap, for the ambience, and service, I would recommend this place. The beef rendang, kway pie ti and coronation chicken were our favourite dishes, ask for the pineapple upside down cake to be served with coconut icecream and you won't regret that combination.
4
They are still popular and so have 2 seatings - 630 and 830. Thought they'll let you eat and chat during the 2nd seating but by 930 they told us about last orders and turned on the white lights at 1030We ordered the regular favourites - bua keleok, assam fish, chap chye, kue pie tee and ngoh hiang. Most were good and the portions smallI may bring business overseas guests next time to let them sample peranakan cuisine but unlikely to return with friend
5
I always feel like putting on a great dress and soaking up the atmosphere of the beautiful National Kitchen. I can't wait to go back because of the perfect service (warm, kind and helpful but not over the top or pretentious!) and who can fault the food or the cocktails. I raise my Haliatini to the staff and chefs of the National Kitchen! Thank you! :)

High tea at Violet Oon's was a total experience of culinary excellence. From the teas/coffee and the Peranakan cuisine to the service and the total ambiance. After visiting the Natiinal Galkery exhibits, high tea at Violet's caps the experience . What a wonderfuk way to highlight a visit to Singapore.
4
This is my second visit to the National kitchen with overseas guests. Once again I was not disappointed, great food, great service in a great setting. Take some time when ordering and order for the table so everyone can taste something different, experience the different tastes and the joys of the food experience. Make sure you book. Enjoy
4
I was told that it is difficult to get a table , and I realised why . fantastic food, cosy ambience, iconic location and friendly service . It is probably the only Peranakan restaurant in a glamourous and chic setting . The portions of the appetisers were larger than expected . I love the Ngoh Hiang - a kind of meat roll in a Beancurd skin and served with sweet sauce and Chilli . It is possibly the best ngoh Hiang I've had in a Rearaurant . The kueh Pie tee ( radish strips in little shells ) were v good too .The beef rendang was delectable - extremely tender and flavourful . The sayur lodeh was good but this recipe had more coconut milk than usuAl and some people may not be used to it . The sambal fish was a tad dry .This is a place that is ideal for a gathering of friends . As tables are close together and the noise level can get high, I wouldn't recommend a business luncheon here . It would be best if your guests enjoy spicy food, or they will not be able to fully appreciate what Nationalkitchen has to offer .I would like to return to sample their afternoon tea set.

Quality food, quality service. I am waiting for my dinner confirmation ... cant wait to be there again!
5
Cosy and tastefully decorated restaurant with nice food. A good place for chilled out with friends and business associates.
5
Arrived at Violet Oons and was instantly impressed by their attention to detail and polite friendly service. Food was amazing. Please try the meatless meatballs and also the satay entree. Enjoy!
5
Best time in a while! The food was exceptional, the decor was beautiful, and service brillant and welcoming.
4
We had a wonderful experience at the National Kitchen. The food was beautiful. I particularly recommend the Kuay Pie Tee, Buah Keluak Ayam and the Fish Head Curry.
5
Whenever I have guests visiting, I take them to Violet Oon.From Jean the hostess to Yegus(sp?), the staff are all amazingly friendly.The bill took a while to come, but it's likely due to the full house of patrons I definitely recommend making reservations to avoid disappointment from walking away with an empty belly. Needless to say, the food is good
5
I visited for dinner with a friend. As soon as I entered the restaurant I was impressed with the art deco interior which was lavish and inviting and visually stunning. There was a real buzz in the restaurant with diners chatting and enjoying themselves which added to the atmosphere. As soon as we walked in we were made to feel very welcome by the waiting staff and they were very helpful and well informed. They made great suggestions regarding the menu and gave reasons why they made those suggestions. Nothing was too much trouble and to honest I had to remind myself I was in Singapore as the decor and excellent service made me think otherwise. Jay, the waiter, was great - he was the only one who's name I knew! As for the food, it was excellent. We had the chicken satay which was a decent serve and had a great chargrilled flavour making it taste fresh and went fantastically with the satay sauce that was the perfect spiciness. We also had the coronation chicken which was really good. For mains we enjoyed the beef rendang which was fantastic and apparently sells out fast most days so we were lucky to snag one! And we had a stunning cod dish and a side of rice to share. Every dish was beautifully cooked and had amazing flavours and I am not normally a massive fan of Peranakan food - I was converted!! I cannot recommend this restaurant enough - the good food is supported and enhanced by the great staff and service!! Thank you Violet Onn's - I will be back

Went with friends who had raved about this place and I can see why. The restaurant is surprisingly small and tucked away on the 2nd floor of the National Gallery. It's worth finding though, the decor is fabulous and quite decadent, in a good way. The food is very good, we shared starters, which were all good, but the personal highlight was my main of beef rendang, this has always been a personal favourite dish, but this one is easily in the top two or three I've ever had, delicious. It's not cheap and the wine list, at least by the glass, was somewhat limited and at times the service could have been slicker, drinks certainly took a while, but overall a great experience and would / will definitely be back
5
OK, so finding this place within the National Gallery wasn't the easiest but once inside the restaurant, the setting is just fabulous. It is a beautiful environment to eat. We had the meatless meatballs Rendang, the Butter Prawns and Hainanese Chicken. The Butter Prawns looked beautiful and tasted great, as did the meatless meatballs. The thing that made this fabulous was the staff. They were incredibly efficient, but friendly and relaxed, in a setting that, on first glance, looks to have the potential to be a bit snooty, but it is far from it. I'm no expert in Peranakan cuisine but our food and dining experience was excellent here
4
The arrival in the Natinal Gallery building may not be that romantic; but once inside this little restaurant, the atmosphere gets better with its charming decoration. It can get noisy at times when the place is full. The cuisine is just delicious, value for money is there. The service is also top level.The location is very practical as well.Great place for business diner. A bit less for romance..
5
One of the best Peranakan restaurants I've been to. The food is delicious, the rempahs are rich n flavorful n the service impeccable. The restaurant's setting is charming n very elegant and prices are reasonable. Highly recommended.

Quality of food 5/5

Many places in singapore serve peranakan food but this place?
Serves peranakan food with SOUL & LOVE.
5
Second time here, and it doesn't disappoint. Incredible food, and really nice team make this one of the best restaurants in Singapore
3
decor of the place is with a modern twist. dessert could have been slightly better. some of the food cooked were less impressive than hawker's skills.very noisy too!table arrangement very cramped.
5
Food was excellent. Good value for money as portions can be shared. Will definitely bring my guests here if they want to sample local food in a great setting.
5
Totally lived up to its reputation. All that, plus getting to wander through the beautiful National Gallery on the way to the dining experience. Great value for money

Another Birthday Celebration- The best reason to gather around good food!We went there with a saying: if the food is not nice, at least the place is beautiful.The dinner was great, the best sayur lodeh and a meatless meatball rendeng surprised me with their favours and I will woah my friends with these 2 dishes!My family especially the kids love the butter prawn, nicely blend and good to go with rice.The service is impeccable, being a Long table of 10 and 3 kids, we might not be most difficult guests but definitely not easy to serve. We were happy with the overall services and their efforts to make the birthday a special one.Thank you
4
Food was great and tasty and made even more enjoyable with the great service. Was my cousin's birthday and they surprised us with a free pineapple cake and even printed a photo of us which they put into photo frame to let us take home. Hope to visit again
5
Came here for dinner and the atmosphere was great though a tad noisy, it could be the fact that it was F1 weekend. Service staff were extremely attentive and friendly. For Starters, we had the Ngoh Hiang, Kuay Pie Tee - both were delicious and we wanted more but we opted to try other starters and got the Turmeric Chicken Wings and Idly served with Coconut & Tomato Chutney. We found the Idly to be an acquired taste. For mains we had Buah Keluak Ayam, Daging Chabek Beef Cheek, Udang Goreng Chilli, Dry Laksa & Nasi Lemak Rice. While we loved them all the star definitely had to be the Buah Keluak Ayam.Having tried a large variety of the dishes on the menu, almost everything is a must try and we will definitely be returning
5
It was a 1st time for us to visit Violet Oon at National Gallery, A superb Peranakan food was presented in a classic way and also the restaurant has a beautiful Middle Eastern set up.Top notch personalized service by a Indian male staff ( didn't manage to get his name ) was extremely professional and a most importantly he addressed us by our name at all the time. Truly a Michelin star experience!
4
Good High Tea Set and portion is just right. Would be better if they provide refill for some items.
Book in advance as sittings are limited.
5
Food was nice and ambience was good. Staffs were very friendly and attentive. They are very engaging with customers as well.
5
The service at this restaurant is fantastic. It was homely and of great quality. Totally loving it. Food was yummy and not too expensive.
5
Great beautiful restaurant, classy service and amazing tea time food selection with different varieties of sweet & savoury local food.

I am Singaporean albeit one that lives overseas and love peranakan food. Prior to visiting many friends mentioned that it was expensive & food not authentic. But nothing is better than experiencing it yourself & I am so glad I did!Located inside the National Art Gallery on Level 2 - it overlooks the padang. The restaurant is charmingly decorated - one feels the pernakan influence & it was all classily done. Service was friendly, prompt & service staff were knowledgeable & helpful. But what shines here is the food. Everything we ate was simply delicious - kuay pie tee, tumeric chicken wings, pong tahu soup, dry laksa, rendang, lady's fingers - all serves were nicely portioned & dishes arrived at a nice pace. The drinks menu was also good - mocktails, cocktails & a small but varied wine list. For the critics who have reviewed otherwise - I think their expectations need to be tempered. This is after all, as their name suggests, a cafe & not a full blown fine dining establishment. As a cafe - ambience, service, food & drinks - nothing can be faulted (hence my 5star rating). Price wise - around S$50/head gets you an absolutely wonderful experience (food & drinks)! Whats not to love about this place?Highly recommend reservations as it is a small outlet & fills up pretty quick!
5
The National Kitchen By Violet Oon has elegant surroundings which makes your experience that little bit special. The 3 Tiered High Tea is a tate bud extravaganza for a selection of Peranakan style savouries and sweets. Accompanied by their own fine blended teas or Kopi (regional coffee) you sample exquisite tasters that will leave you feeling that your trip to the National Gallery was a great success. The extremely helpful and friendly staff add to the experience and I will definitely be making a return journey in the very near future. Excellent 
5
I like Singapore a lot but traveling with kids is not always the easiest as you tend not to see kids in restaurants to the same extent as you do elsewhere. Honestly some of the food was not completely to our taste but the environment, decor and general feel were amazing. The staff were so attentive and friendly. They really got he balance right. They did not hover and pester you but they were right there when you needed them. They anticipated our needs and we felt completely comfortable. A great experience in a unique setting
5
If you want to try real local food in comfort, The National Kitchen by Violet Oon is the place to be. It has the edited version of all the highlights of local cuisines. The staff are very attentive and nice ambience. Please book to ensure you have a table for yourself. While you are there, you can also explore The National Gallery Singapore
4
The presentation and quality of the food served here draws many similarities to the other Violet Oon restaurant - hearty, unpretentious family-style food that makes you feel like you're dining at a friend's house. What made The National Kitchen stand out over the other restaurant was the ambience. The decor of the restaurant was very sleek and modern, yet comfortable and homey. The bluesy tracks playing made it an ideal place to relax over a meal with friends. The service was impeccable and made my dining experience truly one of the best I've had anywhere. Professional and clearly well-trained, the servers were adept at making friendly banter with guests without being obtrusive. Props to both the kitchen and service staff for providing such a wonderful, seamless dining experience! Would definitely be back
4
Ambling through the National Gallery to get to the restaurant puts you in a contemplative mood and this is enhance by the refined, old-style decor of the place. It feels like somewhere that you should dress up for (though you don't have to). The food is not particularly novel but it is expertly prepared and the service is knowledgeable and friendly. Good place to go if you are in town only for a day or two.
4
Love the ambience and decor, feels cozy enough for a good meal despite the lavish setting. Servers were pleasant and kept their smiles on. They are also professional with reservations and punctuality.
5
This lovely restaurant is situated within the National Gallery and the decor is beautiful. Food is excellent and the chicken rice is delicious. Highly recommend it
5
We went with kids and they made sure we were comfortable. The food was very tasty. After a long time I am experiencing good service and from local Singaporean waitors.
5
As long as you done get lost in the museum on the way there this is simply outstanding. Small restaurant - perfect first class service - beautiful ambiance - but the food is what this is about. Capturing historical Singaporean food from the different ethnic mix that Singapore is - you will dine very happily and eat way too much. Great job Violet Oon!!!

I visited National Kitchen at the National Gallery on a Sunday afternoon for lunch with 3 friends. The crowd comprised mostly of families, both Chinese and Caucasians. The atmosphere was casual and laid back, and you could definitely hear the chatter coming from the diners. The restaurant played old jazz tunes and some Elvis.The decor was stunning and it looked like I walked into a swinging 1920s party - like The Great Gatsby! Service was also very good and the waitstaff on duty were friendly and cheerful.The food was also delicious. The Ngoh Hiang ($15) was excellent with cubes of water chestnut adding a refreshing crunch with every bite - definitely one of the best Ngoh Hiang I've tasted. The Beef Cheek ($36) was also well executed with the meat so moist and tender with a a good marbling of collagen-like fat. The Ju Hee Char (fried cuttlefish with cabbage and turnip chap chye) ($13) was average and I would give it a miss the next time.The not so nice part:It was hard trying to secure a reservation and I got a little frustrated when I couldn't even get though (on the phone) twice in two months. I finally decided to make a reservation on Chope slightly more than 2 weeks in advance and managed to secure my reservation. So I'd suggest making your reservations early as the restaurant ALWAYS has a full-house.My group of 4 ordered:1. Ngoh hiang2. Beef rendang3. Ayam buah keluak4. Ju Hee Char5. Sambal Bendi6. Dry Laksa7. 2 white rice8. 3 alcoholic drinks + 1 house sodaWe spent about $52 each on average and we're very full and satisfied
5
My Aussie cousins were visiting for the weekend and I was desperate to let them have a taste of great local food, so I tried booking a lunch table in advance for National KItchen but the earliest sitting i could get was for 2pm. However, when the restaurant opened at 12, I thought I would try my luck. Maitre D Yogi was sooooo lovely, she found us a table and we had the most fab lunch ever - great recommendations by all our servers - dry laksa was very good despite our initial hesitation at ordering it! Thank you for making my cousins and myself feel so welcomed :)

Guess I've finally decided that Peranakan cuisine is not my Favourite. While flavourful, I found all the dishes heavy and lacking finesse or delicacy. Particularly letting down the evening was the clumsy, uneven and even rude service. The atmosphere and decor was too loud and frankly contrived. For a special anniversary dinner, it wasn't special...enough. Sorry
5
Had lunch here on a Saturday. Charmed by the nice ambience and attentive service. All the dishes we tried were excellent, including ngoh hiang,kuay pie tee, chicken lemak, fish tempra sea bass, chap chye, ikan Goreng chilli, kueh dah dah. Prices on the high side but justified given the location, ambience and food quality. Our best Peranakan meal in recent memory.
5
The second time we have visited here. The food is wonderful, the decor lovely and the wait staff friendly and efficient. We had lunch last time and dinner this visit. When we told them it was our friends birthday they brought out a piece of cake with a candle and took a photo of the group, which was later presented to the friend printed and mounted. A lovely gesture

You can't beat the ambiance here at the National Gallery. The decor of the NationalKitchen is very impressive set in the historical Supreme Court Building now turned National Gallery.On to the food served. This is NOT authentic Peranakan food - it's more like a water-down version but good introduction for foreigners. The real stuff would be too in-your-face for a non-Peranakan to appreciate.Violet Oon has struck a gold mine here - serving very expensive food in a beautiful setting. The food is only so-so with a few hits and misses.You will spend at least $50 per head for lunch without counting in any beverage - even non-alcoholic. If you order wine, be sure you up the limit on your credit card (Peranakan food is too strong tasting for wine -so don't waste your money!)HitsNgoh Hiang - deep fried prawn crab and chicken meat wrapped in a bean curd skinLemak chicken - chicken on the bone served in a spicy coconut curry Kuay Pie Tee - fried flour shell cup filled with cooked shredded turnip, carrots and dried shrimpChicken Satay - grilled chicken pieces on a stick (you get 3 sticks per order) served with a spicy peanut-pineapple dipButter PrawnsDry LaksaBuah Keluak Noodles - a very tiny portion for the price ChendolRoti JalaMissesCoronation Chicken Cup - dried shredded chicken meat with a sweet sauce and mayo(?)Ikan Goreng Chili - fish was not freshKueh Dada - the crepe skin was too thick and very dryChap Chye - mixed veg - first time I didn't like Nonya Chap ChyePulot Hitam - black glutinous rice Be sure to go to the roof top after dinner. There is a free area between 2 bars - you will get a fantastic view of the Padang and Marina Bay Sands.
5
We had a lovely meal here during our recent trip to Singapore. The food is delicious. A little pricier than others but worth it. The service was truly excellent.
5
Great ambience and amazing food. The restaurant being in the national gallery adds to the 'wow' factor and bringing visitors to have peranakan food in this building just adds to the entire effect.
5
Have dinner with 6 friends.
Beautiful decor; Nostalgic atmosphere, delicious food. Service staff were very attentive.The beef rendang was fantastic. Food may be on the spicy side. Dessert even better.
5
Team is very attentive and knowledgable about the menu. Food is authentic and tasty and they have good portion sizes. (Chicken satay and beef rendang are must trys! And don't forget the desserts.....pick any one!). Great decor and atmosphere as well.
5
Fabulous authentic peranakan food served with excellent service. Great value for money and time. Will definitely return.

In all, I have visited the restaurant 4 times now and have remained impressed with the food. It would be great if diners can book more spacious seating even if a minimum spend is required. As we are appetiser fans, the small size tables are really a squeeze for the many dishes we love to order. To quickly wolf down the food just to make room on the table seem a bit of a waste.Anyway, back to the food. The kueh pie tee is a real standout for its crispy melt-in-your-mouth cups and tasty fillings. No need to rush to Malacca or Penang for yummy Peranakan food, folks. While prices are not low, I would not consider them unreasonable in view of the high overheads in Singapore - at least the food seemed to be carefully and masterfully prepared from quality ingredients. The well marinated and charcoal grilled chicken satay was extremely delicious too. Stay away from the cold desserts - they appeared to have been sitting the fridge for a bit and tasted hard and frozen. Stick to the kueh dadar and kueh bengka for that yummy home-made kueh taste. For carbo, the dry laksa was delicious while those who prefer something plainer may prefer the dry mee siam. While we enjoyed the ngoh hiang, it would have tasted even better if water chestnut is used instead of onion.We would certainly keep coming back and hope the restaurant would maintain its current standards

We am very confident that food by Chef Violet Oon will be fantastic but it's a pity we didnt get to try it despite making a reservation 3 weeks ago. My fianc√É¬© made a surprise reservation 3 weeks ago and, being popular, only a weekday and late seating at 8.30pm was available. I was so thrilled when I found out. He received an email reminder in the day that our table will be released if we are late but it's understandable as they are very busy. We arrived on time and was told by a hostess that our table wasn't ready and the other guests will be leaving soon. Wasn't very impress with that but what is a few minutes after waited for 3 weeks. The Hostess then pointed to a table which guests were about to leave and give them some time to turn over. We patiently waited but we were shocked when 3 people who just walked in but stood infront of us was immediately shown to our table by another hostess. We waited almost 30 min for nothing and the restaurant was full so no other table could be given to us. We left feeling let down, furious, and hungry. All the staff did at that moment was just apologizing and hoping we could wait longer for another table. This is not what I expect from a reputable place with high trip advisor ratings.The reason for this review is hope the restaurant realize the importance to have a competent and trained staff at the first arrival. Poor service at the door set a bad start to the dining experience and worse having guests storming out of the restaurant do not do justice to the great reputation of Chef Violet Oon's culinary offerings. I hope you will look into this for improvement. You did well on the service recovery by contacting us that evening. We appreciate that but sadly nothing can change how we have been treated and felt that evening
5
Set in the historic Courts/Justice buildings now refurbished to include National Art gallery too. Roof top bar to try a few cocktails then wander downstairs to try some authentic EuroAsian Singaporean food. Chill crab & Beef Rendang are a real must. Fantastic service in a beautiful setting
4
This is a good place to check out if:1. You are at the National Gallery and are looking for a posh but casual place to eat.2. You have guests from out of town and want to introduce them to Straits Chinese /Peranakan food.The food is generally tasty and competently prepared. Most of the dishes are meant to be homestyle stuff so we thought the upscale fit out for the restaurant a little at odds with the style of cooking. The service is professional and attentive. During the work week, the restaurant is popular with the business crowd while during the weekend, you are more likely to be in the company of families and the ladies who lunch.You'll probably notice from the menu that many of the traditional Peranakan dishes involve slow cooking - meat or vegetables are stewed with spices and sometimes coconut milk for hours to achieve the much sought after deep rich flavours. Some of the highlights for us were:- the lovely chilli blachan served as a condiment for every diner (sadly not available to take away)- the beef redang (meltingly tender beef shin stewed with local spices) - the chap chye (mixed vegetables stewed in seafood stock)- chicken lemak (boneless chicken stewed in a thick fragrant curry)The deserts were a little disappointing. Many of them have been tweaked in an attempt to modernise them - for example, adding coconut ice cream instead of coconut milk. The kueh dah dah - sold out on our first visit, would be our pick from the menu.So all in all we'd say 3.5 stars for National Kitchen
4
Heard alot about Violet Oon's fantastic cooking and then from colleagues about this National Kitchen, so Google about the newly opened place at National Gallery. Suggested to my friends who wanted to give me a treat for my birthday. Though prices on a slightly higher side (mid-range) & a distance from MRT, they agreed. All of us found the dishes good (except for one) & even thought to come again to try other dished for the next person's birthday
5
The food at National Kitchen tasted great and came in well-sized portions.
The service was excellent as well. I'd like to thank Shiraj and Chris for being professional and warm at the same time. National Kitchen is lucky to have them as staff.
5
This is a great place to try a unique cuisine, Amazing Satay, Beef rendang and Nasi lamak rice is sublime. The staff is very professional.
The place is packed with Locals customers..that's mean a lot.
A must try!
3
The restaurant has nice d√©cor and ambience. However the food lacks oomph. If you want real Peranakan food this is not the place. Many dishes are modified or watered down for western palettes. Prices are high.
5
Selection of perennial favourites for high tea. Value for money!
Whatever you see in the photos.....All good! 3 trays of pure mouth-watering goodness.
For me, a coffee drinker, the "kopi" local style is the best gourmet coffee to be had.
5
excellent food & beautiful ambience! great choice for a family birthday celebration. every dish was superb
3
Food was so so as compared to the very beautiful decor. I guess if you walk into this lovely restaurant with posh interior design, your expectation of the food would be raised naturally. However, I was disappointed with the food. It was very average compared to other peranakan food I have had before. I dont think I will visit again. Once for the experience is enough
5
This is a must when in Singapore. A great setting a wonderful meal with something for everyone and for all tastes. Spend some time enjoy the food, the service is exceptional and this is one not to be missed. Make sure you book to avoid disappointment as with this experience I am sure they are always busy. Enjoy
3
Quite disappointed with the place.Book a 8.30 slot,went half h early but was told i only can be seated only at 8.30 ,no earlier.i had to find a place to seat at the national gallery until 8.30.When we were seated at 8.30,i was told that the signature ayam buah keluak was not available when i am ordering.very disappointed as i was there to try the dish.The environment is very modern with peranakan style.Advise not to go there for dating as the place was very noisy and loud.Could hear the different conversation around us.Positive side is that the buah keluak noodle & the kuah dah dah is good. Also the nasi lemak rice is very fragrance,even from the next table we could smell it
5
The Peranakan cuisine is very tasty and the restaurant ambience is nice and classy, reasonable price and yet close to fine dining experience. The salt fish sambal is very tasty and it is first time I tried this dish. I will recommend the Buah Keruah Ayam which is very nice. The tahu goreng also veto different from those Malay and Indonesian type. It is almost fully booked even on Monday evening, so make a table reservation is recommended
5
My family and I absolutely loved our dinner in this spectacular restaurant. The service was friendly, informative and prompt. Every dish we ordered we loved including the desserts which were top notch. The restaurant is located inside a the National Gallery, itself an architectural masterpiece and I found it one of the most beautiful restaurants I have ever been inside. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a traditional Peranakan meal
5
Great place for birthday celebrations and gatherings be it with family or friends. A place where casual lunch meeting can be held at. Highly recommended.
5
I enjoyed the National Kitchen as part of a business dinner. The experience was impressive with an impressive setting. Seating was a bit tight, but the atmosphere and food more than made up for it.
5
The food was so authentic! Loved the ambience! We order the dry mee Siam and laksa which was out of this world. Tahu goreng and ngoh hiang was really good too! The dessert, roti jala with gula Melaka is a must try!
4
Took a while to find it but at the end it was compensated by the very good food, good service but a bit too quick, reasonable prices.
4
Unlike several many fine restaurants in Singapore, National Kitchen is one of the better restaurant for its local Peranakan type of food. Food is tasty but costly for such type of food for many average Singaporeans. Ambience is nice.
5
It is nestled on the second floor of the national gallery of art Singapore. the food is fantastic. I beeline the the complex spices are made from fresh ingredients. Amidst for foodie.
4
My group ordered 1 soup, 3 starters, 1 meat, 1 seafood, 1 noodle, desserts and drinks and it worked out to around $55/ pax. Its pretty reasonable for the ambience, quality of food and awesome service! Some dishes could have been better but the freshness of ingredients made up for it. Worth a visit!
5
I am not sure how authentic the food is to true peranakan cuisine, cos I have never been a real fan of true blue peranakan dishes, but whatever Violet Oon has done, it works and I love it. It has rich spicy flavours but hint more of the Malay style and flavours - which I love and work so well. There is a richness and sweetness to the dishes which merry local Singaporean with peranakan and Malay. We had the Tamarind Chicken Wings, Tahu Goreng and Rojak for starters, the Laksa Pesto fish, Ayam Buah Keluak and Beef Rendang paired with fragrant nasi lemak rice, chicken rice and jasmine rice. We finished off with an assortment of desserts including the chendol. Absolutely heavenly - one of the best meals I've had in a while
4
Enjoyed a good meal here in great surroundings - the restaurant is housed in the national gallery. A relatively small restaurant; the large group I was with seemed to overwhelm the wait staff, the food and particularly seemed to take an age to organize.Really enjoyed the appetizers (Ngoh Hiang and Kuay Pie Tee), and the Chicken Lemak as the entree. Also tried the beef cheek, which was delicious and very tender. Be cautious if you do not like spicy food as many of the dishes has a reasonable 'kick' to the

On business trip through Asia and my team took me to this wonderful restaurant. I'm not going to give the gist away on the setting (just google it) but the food is just awesome. Everything I tasted was just wonderful. Nothing I can say I didn't enjoy. Also the explanations we've got from the waiter on the composition of the food... Top notch. Make sure to check this out
4
Booking is only online. Sometimes need help. Hard to get staff on the phone. Is there breakfast? If yes, will be good for just weekend?
5
Experience/atmosphere: Interior design is gorgeous with a touch of class. Great taste!
Service: Though food preparation is a bit slow, its compensated by service from the efficient, warmth and accommodating staff.
Food: Needless to be mentioned. Presentation is stunning and food quality is tip top.
5
The ambiance was superb. The service staff was very friendly and the kind attention they have on each table. The food was good, especially the satay gravy and beef rendang.
3
Ambience is nice but a little too pack.. Service is ok.
Most of the Peranakan dishes we order were good but not special..
Prices are a little steep for this type of food..

We came here to celebrate my sister's graduation last week. We were treated like VIPs from start to finish by an excellent wait staff (Sam, especially, was super attentive to us). The food was even better than we thought it would be. My dad particularly liked the beef rendang (no photos, unfortunately) which obviously took time to prepare, as it was marinated in spices and was so tender you could cut it with a fork. A big part of our experience was the decor - elegant chandeliers, intricate floor and wall tiles, and black and white framed photos on the walls. Made us feel we were dining in a classic colonial-era restaurant. We just enjoyed everything in National Kitchen and will dine here every time we're in Singapore

My first time to visit the National Gallery and spent a wonderful afternoon tea at one of their restaurant - National Kitchen by Violet Oon. This is not my first time to try Pernakan afternoon tea, but this time, I am really impressed. Not only the French style restaurant is stunning, but their afternoon snacks are both tasty and creative. The waiters are very responsive when we complained that our tea didn't pair well with the savory snacks, one of them immediate suggested to offer another pot of tea. But the problem is not on the tea, the tea actually is pretty good, the problem is the savoury snacks are rather strong taste, which I am afraid only strong Chinese tea can do the job. Anyway, other than the tea issue, we have a wonderful time at National Kitchen

Whether you a long term fan of Peranakan food or just want to try something new, this is a wonderful place to enjoy the very best that the local food scene has to offer in Singapore. Every dish is excellent and you can fill yourself up with the starters and side dishes alone. Save some room for the authentic local deserts. And as other reviewers have noted the service is absolutely impeccable. Which if you have spent any time dining in Singapore is something to be very proud of indeed

We really loved the food and atmosphere at the Bukit Timah Rd mothership, and wanted to try this place. The food was of the same very high standard, the service was more organised and attentive, and the decor and atmosphere are great.The noise level here is slightly lower, so you can converse without shouting. The ambience, decor and furniture really evoke the older Singapore, so much of which has given way to the insistent demands of modern life.The peranakan food is a must-try if you are in Singapore. The flavours are rich, the ingredients of high quality, and the spicing is beautifully judged. Not all dishes are hot, although there are enough for the more adventurous palates, but all are wonderfully complex. Everything is (as one would expect and hope) cooked to order, so be prepared to wait a little; the place is, understandably, running at full capacity.It's impossible to recommend anything in particular. The best tip is to go with a group, order as many different dishes as you can, and share! And do leave room for dessert.There is a small but well organised wine list, and if you really want, you can find a bottle to match whatever the kitchen sends out.The value is excellent, particularly if you leave the wine list alone (and what's wrong with beer for this food? Nothing!).Don't miss it

I am a fan of VIolet Oon's cookbooks having successfully cooked many delicious dishes from them and I had high expectations. We have also visited her other more rustic restaurant in Bukit Timah and it was good but pricey.We booked online through the Chope app stating that it was my mother in law's birthday with some special requests which they met. They even surprised her with a slice of Kueh Ambon and a candle at the end and served our own birthday cake beautifully and presented her with a nce photo of the group in a frame.The service was prompt and professional yet cheerful and friendly.The food was excellent as usual. We had the braised beef cheeks which was melt in the mouth and very tender, the sambal brinjals were also very tasty. The Prawns in chilli were very spicy-hot. All the other dishes were of high standard.The only thing we were not too happy with was the gula melaka and banana smoothie, as they used an unripe banana so it was rather tart and we could not taste the gula melaka. They checked with us and when we mentioned the smoothie they took it away and topped up the gula melaka,Because we asked for a quiet table we were given a booth which was probably meant for 4 and not six so we were sitting shoulder to shoulder and a tight squeeze ( didn't matter so much to us as it was a family group but probably would not have been suitable for a group of 6 business associates).Prices seemed rather high but given the location in posh surroundings of the former CIty Hall and the quality of the service and decor, it was expected. It cost the same as her more rustic restaurant for the same food and we would rather drive a little further to this outlet as the surroundings are so much more impressive and much quieter and more conducive. I did not patronise the other outlet very often as I felt it was too expensive for a neighbourhood place.Overall, we were very happy and will be back for many more special occasions

This is my second time to Violet Oon within two months. The first visit was at the 6th Avenue outlet and yesterday I took my brother who was visiting Singapore to the National Kitchen. Both outlets keep different menus, especially the deserts. I simply love the ambience which is very British aka colonial style deco with peranakan flavour. The food is really delicious, although slightly different in presentation from the Peranakan food in Penang. My favourite are the "pie tie" (I like the crunchiness of the shells) and the deserts. I try to order different desserts every time and get a very pleasant surprise with each one as there is a twist to the traditionally expected style of these deserts. For e.g. instead of coconut milk, it is replaced by very rich coconut ice cream for the chendol and the "bee koh moi". I would definitely recommend this restaurant, for the food and the ambience
4
We took our boss for a Perankan lunch. This is the first time he tried Perankan. We all enjoy the authenticity of the cusine
5
We were fortunate to be able to dine at this very popular spot. The food was excellent and very well presented. Service was very attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.
3
Service was good with attentive staff members. Food was very strong flavoured and pricing wise, it seems very expensive.
5
We came here for a farewell dinner and the food was top quality. The restaurant decor is stunning and the staff are friendly. Overall we had a special meal we will never forget.
4
The restaurant is a bit cramped for family gatherings but overall a good experience with great service.
5
Excellent food, service & ambience. Prices are on the high side but you are paying for quality. Will be back to try the other dishes.
4
Positive: good service and good quality food. Nice ambience and decor. Beef rendang and chap chye very good. The special tea blend (rose with almond) is excellent!Negative: Ngo Hiang seems to lack of some flavour though texture is soft inside and crunchy outside... The salted veg duck soup is a let down as the ingredients is very little and the soup is not sour enough
5
In a city that may quickly forget the old ways, Violent Oon's National Kitchen is a tribute to the Peranakan past. I'm an American visiting Singapore for the first time. My friend Ming Chi, a life-long local was the one who made the suggestion. As she said, the Peranakan style of cooking is something to experience. One day prior, we made reservations for lunch on a Monday and could only get a 2:00 seating. It was worth the wait and gave us more time to explore the museum filled with national treasures. As many other reviews attest, the charm and the comfort of the setting alone make it a memorable meal. The orchestra of staff were equally kind and accommodating.Our starters included Ngoh Hiang. This fried cake with a bean curd crust is made of prawn, chicken, and crab. The flavor, especially when dipped in the chilli lime sauce, was delicious. My colonial taste buds especially enjoyed the Coronation chicken in Wantan Leaf Cup-- A perfect blend of crisp and creamy; curry and sweet.For our main course we ordered Dry Laksa and Sayur Lodeh respectively. Ming Chi's Laksa was just the right amount of spicy, and my vegetable tempeh curry was smooth and filling eaten with rice.For dessert we shared Kueh Beng Kah and two local coffees. The tapioca cake was steamed and served with the sweet brown sugar sauce (Gula Melaka) and coconut milk for dipping.We left full. We left happy in body and mind. We also left with a genuine appreciation for the tradition of cooking that so perfectly blends cultures and flavors
4
While one can argue that beef rendang is best (and cheaper) at Nasi Pariaman (along North Bridge Road) and hainanese chicken rice is better (and cheaper) in Wee Nam Kee (in Novena), Violet Oon's restaurant inside the National Gallery (NG) is a most elegant place to savour these dishes. In the walls hang Peranakan tiles. There are tables in alcoves that may be reserved for an even more intimate gathering. And there is a private space that fits a table for eight to ten, which may be booked for a minimum consumable (could be ideal for an office or family celebration). Members of the NG get a 10% discount
5
I have tasted the peranakan food in Singapore and Malaysia several times before. The best experience is the latest fine dinning held at the Violet Oon, a classic restaurant which is located on the ground floor of the National Gallery. Advance booking is recommended. Chinese-Malay fusion food with difference variety are amazing. It is hot and a little sour but tasteful and yummy....I shall be back with family 
5
Great ambience and food. Worth the wait. Servers were friendly and caring. Food was well priced and affordable. Would recommend to anyone who loves peranakan food.
5
Beautiful place to enjoy authentic peranakan food. Thanks for your warm friendly service and for providing a quiet corner table as requested.
5
The food was amazing. Every dish had its own different spectacular taste. Over the moon wonderful. It is also a cool location as part of the National Museum building.
4
Unforgettable Curry Fish and Kueh Dadar plus a memorable chat with Violet Onn herself walking us through her wall photos, together with a privileged opportunity to meet Connie Sheares seated next me!Will return again to check its magic in the evening, what with an inviting balcony overlooking the Padang.
5
Steady rapport among servers serving up cultured food. Liked the Fish Head Curry best. Level of spiciness was just right without overburning the ingredients. Buah Kelauk is another darling of ours though flavour was unfamiliar. It was warming to meet up close friends of almost a decade upon return to sunny singapore. Definitely a place to revist
4
Why won't Tripadvisor have either 1/2 ratings or a "GOOD" rating - it goes from 3 (Average) to 4 (Very Good). What happened to 'Good'?? which is how I would rate National Kitchen by Violet Oon.First of all, the setting is absolutely inviting. Housed in the historic City Hall building which is now Singapore's National Gallery, the decor oozes plush, dark-wood, elegant old-world charm; one simply has to like it, there's no doubt. Just look at the pictures!I was surprised though, upon entering the restaurant, that the space itself is really quite small. I wondered why that is so, given the time & effort spent in creating this most elegant space, and yet the tables are all rather cramped together. To preface my food comments, I have to say that we are not fans of Peranakan cuisine. We ordered the Duck Soup - too salty, Satay - not bad, Beef Rendang - delicious, Beef Cheeks - fantastic, Ju Hee Char - bland, Hainanese Chicken Rice - ok, nothing extraordinary except its $17 price, Dry Mee Siam - pretty good, Pulut Hitam with Ice Cream - have tasted better in many other places, and the Chendol - mediocre. Service was excellent and exemplary; ambience...well, since the tables are so close together, it cannot be ideal, but I guess the decor does make up for it. Prices are understandably higher, not because the food necessarily tastes superior, but because of its surroundings and elegant setting. It's like Peranakan quasi-fine dining.Would we return? Yes maybe, but only as a tourist-destination restaurant
4
Despite unable to make a reservation for the time we wanted to have dinner there, I took the chance of just walking in as written on their website. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. No airs at all despite the restaurant looking very posh! Food was excellent and the ambience was just wonderful. Elegantly set up but at the same time, warm and cosy. My family enjoyed the whole dining experience tremendously and will definitely be back for more.
3
When with my friend & cousins to this advertise Hight Tea min 2 pax at $28++per person was as a little disappointed. Service was Great but the food cannot fill the stomach .Item was so small look like for kids to Eat than Adult.The Gula Melaka in the small jar was so Thick & little hardly able to pour out .Glutinous was a little hard .Portion should be a litlle more generous.
3
The dishes were served within a short waiting time, and presentation was pretty, however the pong Tahru had too strong a prawn taste and the desserts were a tad too sweet. However, the sambal and spices used were very authentic and Peranakan and the dishes were full of flavour
5
come with a big appetite or big group so that you can try as many of the excellent dishes! there are so many authentic tasting dishes, depending on how spicy or tangy or sour or sweet you like your dish. Satay is specially prepared and runs out quite fast. too many nice dishes. for dessert try the kueh bengka , chendol and pulot hitam ... and wash it down with the strong Kopi VO ! staff are friendly and offer good tips on food, servings portions and help you not to over order - because you will be tempted 
5
It's my fifth time dining here, be it for business or with family. Ambience is good as usual and my favourite will be dry laksa
3
Beautiful setting and delicious food but they had run out of the satay and rojak which felt quite strange given they were the easiest dishes to prepare and had the simplest ingredients. They also made us lave at 1030pm whether we ere ready or not.
5
The Kueh Pie Tee is a must-try, and I love the Hainanese Chicken Rice. The dry laksa that my son had was also surprisingly good. Should come and try, and also take a look at the various nice art galleries and the grand refurbished parliament house. Lots of things to experience
3
2030 reservation, but table was not ready till 2045. Serving staff seemed overwhelmed (it was a full house). Poor acoustics - difficult to have conversations without raising our voices. To their credit, the staff tried to make up for it with free dessert. But we're probably going to stick with their BukitTimah branch in future
5
The perfect setting for a birthday celebration. There were 8 in the group, we were so well looked after. The food was amazing and the staff attentive. Somehow they picked up on the birthday boy and presented him with a candle topped slice of cake at the end of the meal, then took a photo of the group which they gave him in a presentation folder, fantastic souvenir. I would be delighted to have the opportunity to go there again
5
Visiting the National Gallery we had our lunch at this restaurant.The waiters were super friendly and the menu is very authentic. We tasted food we have never had before in Asia. The claim that they want to offer authentic food is completely true and must to try
4
We had dinner here on a Sunday night and fell in love with it! We were one of the 1st to arrive but tables filled up quickly.The place is beautifully done up and the service was friendly and fantastic! Shows how important the service crew is as is the food! One cannot do without the other as this encompasses the whole dining experience.We had the kiam chye ark thng (salted veg with duck soup), kueh pie tee and rojak for starters and esp love the kiam chye ark thng! For mains, we ordered the beef rendang and cod in creamy laksa sauce. The cod was nice but the beef rendang was so unbelievably tender and soft! We finally had pulot hitam with coconut ice cream for dessert. Somewhat different from the ones we are used to eating, this version had a more distinct coconut flavour!The sambal belachan is also sedap!! We asked the wait staff and was told they are in the midst of preps to sell it (once they get all the certs and approvals).I'm already starting to plan for my next visit to their other outlet at Bukit Timah
4
This is certainly one of the best fine dining restaurants in Singapore. The food is outstanding and in particular the attention to detail the way each of the portions are presented. We had a large group and the comments were very positive, the service was excellent and very personable - they explain each component of the meal before you dine and well matched to appropriate wine. It's an unusual setting in the national gallery which is very quiet at night but inside the restaurant the d√É¬©cor creates a wonderful atmosphere
5
I think it was a stroke of pure luck and perhaps my persistence and God's will that I managed to get a table for two for dinner considering I had try with 3 different dates and all 3 dates were full house! I was there to celebrate my birthday and I went back with a really happy tummy. Service was attentive, impeccable and warm. We ordered ngoh hiang, their bomb diggity kueh pie tee, buah keluak ayam, dry laksa noodle. Dessert was the soft roti jala and banana sweet sauce. The food did not disappoint at all. I think for two pax, we had more than enough for dinner. The dessert was a little too sweet and overpowered by the sliced banana. Nonetheless, enjoyable still. I am a Peranakan girl and I shouldn't be enjoying Peranakan food outside of my house but I will go back to National Kitchen in a heartbeat to have my Peranakan fare. :
5
This was our second visit, the first was for lunch and this time we were there for dinner with friends. One of our party could not each Chilli so we asked for some help from one of the waiters. He was so lovely and charming and helped us choose some dishes. The beef cheeks were delicious but seriously spicy and the Chilli crab, whilst delicious was the hottest I have ever had in Singapore. The little Nonya cups full of bamboo shoots and prawns are an old Favourite and were utterly delicious. The wine is fairly expensive and the total price was standard for Singapore, ie: not the place if you are on a Budget. The decor and styling is beautiful but the original in Bukit Timah feels more authentic
4
Food and service were good. Only thing is that it is very difficult to make reservations or call the restaurant.
5
Have lunch with about 10 friends.
Beautiful decor, Nostalgic atmosphere, delicious food.
The beef rendang was fantastic.
Dessert even better.
5
Elegantly decorated Peranakan eatery. Excellent staff. Wonderful food, without being too complicated.
4
service was great, but a table of 4 ladies next to us was really loud and their laughter meant we could not carry on a decent conversation from the moment they arrived till we left.
4
Good decor, nice food, attentive service, only downside some of the dishes taste a bit too strong
5
Probably amongst the the best Peranakan food in Singapore, so flavorful and rich in taste. Great restaurant ambience, with much attention given to its decor and interiors. Not forgetting service was excellent. An overall wonderful dining experience and would definitely recommend to everyone.
5
The service was all rounded and the decor is very high-class. The desserts are a must-have. Overall, it was a wonderful experience :)
5
My wife had been previously and loved it and my experience was no less. AMAZING food and so proudly Singapore and so great to find it. Staff were exceptional and back to the food. AMAZING. Also appreciated the follow up. Defiantly going back

 We always discuss about food and where to eat. We quite strongly against going to violet kitchen. We dont fancy violet food and most said is expensive. But a friend insisted that we should try national kitchen. ( violet oon)We book a table for 3 on a Saturday for lunch. First to arrive and was greeted by cheerful staff.We order appetizers sambal kimchiam udang $15, buah keluak ayam $23, sotong itam , satay $12 for 3 stick, chap chye $15, dry laska $22 & bubur itam (dessert 1 portion to share/try) total $140 include take away.Dry laska & Satay was recommended to us.Appetizers was good. Buah keluak ayam not good enough ( I cook better) sotong itam gravy taste good but sotong taste funny, as the different staff keep checking with us we gave them the feed back as what I'm writing now. So he (raj) went to ask the cook and he came back and told us maybe the sotong was not so fresh it taste like chicken meat not chewy he said he wouldn't charge us that was a suprise a good gesture. The satay was good i order two portion take away for my children . Chap chye was normal , the dry laska was good and dessert was also good serve with ice cream. We finish almost all except the sotong itam and dry laska too much to eat.Overall we enjoy the foods, service, ambience. We change our view about violet kitchen and will bring our family and strongly recommend our friend to patronise this lovely restaurant. Good food reasonable price. 
5
Wow, what a gorgeous venue. Luxe decor (crystal chandeliers, dark wood, clubby leather banquettes, polished brass) and impeccable service reminded me of the Venice-Simplon Orient Express but with a modern vibe. Peranakan accents in the colorful tiles, photographs and displayed artifacts were so charming!And the food. Another wow. Even though Peranakan cuisine is a favorite among my Singapore friends and we eat it often, I'm not easily impressed. But this was hands down the best I've ever had. The Chicken Lemak is not to be missed. So flavorful and complex! Makes my lifetime list of Memorable Dishes
5
It was worth waiting 2 weeks for this reservation to materialise. Food was excellent, desserts to die for. And very attentive service to boot. Keep up the standard and fly the flag high, after all its the National Kitchen.
5
Food was fantastic, beef rendang was super-spicy but so delicious. The cocktails were really strong, which went down very well!
5
they serve excellent food, comfort food, the service was excellent, and the prices were reasonable, very recommendable place to go
5
My group of 4 had lunch here and was blown away by the quality of the food and excellent service. The room is gorgeously designed with beautiful peranakan tiles weaved in with elements of an old English pub - sounds crazy, but it really works! The food is where this place shines - Violet Oon is indeed a national treasure - dish after dish of lip smacking goodness!! Stand out dishes (although hard to pick) were the slow cooked beef cheeks, cod with laksa spice and ngoh hiang.I would come back to Singapore just to eat here again
5
A Singapore based friend recommended The National Kitchen but said I would be lucky to get in because there is a waiting list for tables of months. But despite arriving at 1pm I was able to get a spot on the counter. Essentially the food style is an upscale version of Hawker food. But adapted and made very special. I loved it. The dishes are designed for sharing around a table, but don't let that put you off - I was on my own and still enjoyed the menu. The restaurant is noisy ( I noted the comments of other reviewers) but in a very pleasant vibrant way, so did not find it a problem. To the contrary it added to the "vibe". My experience was that the service was super attentive and friendly. Very happy to take time to check that everything was to my liking and make sure I was happy. Definitely recommended
3
Hidden in the National Gallery, the National Kitchen by Violet Oon is a beautiful jewel box of a restaurant with delicious and attractive food. But our not inexpensive set menu for a large party was served in haste with unnecessary pressure to move on to dessert and the waitstaff ran up the bill by continuing to open water bottles and filling glasses without asking long after the food had ended. The service was competent but unfriendly with no explanation of the food and certainly no smiles. One of our guests had food from the table carelessly swept into her lap with no apology until after she complained. Could have been a much better experience
4
Classy decor, friendly staff (if you can get their attention). The ngor hiang and joo hu char were nice, beef cheek was not what I was expecting and satay was quite burnt. However, the kueh bengka and (local) coffee were divine, would return just for that
5
National Kitchen is a stunning, intimate and warm place. The food is delicious - the beef rendang especially sublime. The standout experience was due to the staff who catered preemptive lay to our whims. When they overheard my children's natter over their distaste of "lemon" water, they promptly brought out a jug of water with no lemon. Wonderful!
2
Likes: - FOOD, especially chicken stewed with keluak nuts and tamarind is very tasty and different, and fish-head curry with baby eggplants and okra.- DECOR is beautiful but ambience destoyed by noise. Surfaces are harsh and reflect the noise i think.- INEXPENSIVE.Dislikes: - NOISY, it was really too loud to hear people at a table of 6.- SERVICE POOR. Mistakes in order were explained by waitress as her decision to change!- NO CHAMPAGNE left! I know this is a first world problem, but we wanted to celebrate an event and prosecco is not the same despite our waitress trying to pass it off.- No attention paid to my ALLERGIES (i know which ones to avoid from their other restaurant but this is inexcusable). Be careful.- Cocktails and drink menu is limited, for example, they couldn't make a Bloody Mary.- NOISY.Recommend: - Book private room to avoid noise if you have a group.- Smoke & Mirrors bar upstairs on L6. Amazing panoramic views from the Padang over to MBS. Book a table after dinner to have the conversation you didn't have at VO.I wouldn't return. Shame, the food is so good
2
The restaurant was too noisy. There is no soft furnishings in the restaurant to sop up noise.I had Tamarind Chicken Wings which was over fried making it very dry. The "laksa bee hoon" used in the Dry Mee Siam was a little too soggy and it wasn't presented and taste like original dry mee siam. Chap Chai was average, there's no clear distinction between theirs and other peranakan restaurants
4
Love this place, this is first visit, food is very good, recommend for 4 person and above will be better to try more dishes, will be back again!
4
One of my favorite! Should go and try
Pricing is valuable.
The place at 2nd floor at National gallery
Please call for reserved the table üòç

We had a wonderful meal at National Kitchen. The items we ordered were fresh and beautifully presented. Tofu and satay to start, and chili crab and two shrimp dishes for main courses. National Kitchen is a small restaurant within the National Gallery. You need to enter on the side street, rather than the main entrances, for after-hours museum dining. The evening we dined there there were two or three large parties. The room was very noisy, because the parties were speaking quite loudly and there is nothing to absorb the sound...the restaurant though pretty, is all tile and hard surfaces. The staff were not up to par for the quality of the food served. Maybe it was the large groups, but there are things they need to take care of without delay or being asked: changing plates between courses, offering additional clean silverware for the next dishes served, taking away the finished plates at one time rather than one at a time, bringing some entrees out before the rest of the entrees were ready... Our waitress was very well informed and on top of things but she must have finished her shift in the middle of our dinner, because she disappeared. The rest of the staff was not tuned in enough to all the tables. We ordered three bottles of wine before they actually had what we wanted. The wine list is small to begin with, with high prices for many of the bottles toward the bottom of the list, so they should have had more of the lower priced bottles available. We ended up drinking a wine which was fine, but not our first choice relative to price we wanted to pay. Pour ordering and planning on the part of the staff. Fine restaurants have wonderful food but also well-trained staff and great service. National Kitchen has the food component down, but needs to work on the service aspect before they can be called one of the better restaurants in Singapore.

I wanted to try nonyan cuisine and found this restaurant after reading reviews about its dry laksa . As a laksa lover, I tried to experience as many places as possible every time I visit Singapore. This place is not that big and is located in national gallery by the river. A very hip yet classy setting. The decor is also very nice and elegant.I was alone so I could only eat two dishes: rajok, and the dry laksa. Both were very delicious . The laksa was so immersed and concentrated , that I found it absolute sensational. It is pricy at SGD22, definitely worth a try.I would definitely come back and recommend this restaurant to others

Violet Oon's National Kitchen opened in December of 2015 in the National Gallery of Singapore ( former Supreme Court ) to a fair bit of hype and fanfare .Violet needs no introduction in Singapore . She is a household name. In her early years she was a well known journalist who later became famous as a food critic, chef, consultant and cookbook writer in Singapore's culinary scene.The National Kitchen serves up Peranakan Food which is a fusion of the Chinese , Malay, and Indonesian cuisine, using blends of their various aromatic spices and herbs. Since the restaurant's opening, I have heard mixed reviews, some positive and some negative. So what better way than to check the place out for myself. I had lunch there on 5 April with a group of 6 friends from Hong Kong. The restaurant itself was not as big as I had thought it to be judged from photos seen. It seats 70 indoors with some tables outside for Alfresco dining for those who like it warm.DECOR: I loved the interior. The colourful tiles on the walls and floors, combined with dark wood and the art deco chandeliers and lights were visually appealing to the eyes and created a tasteful overall look for the place. The only thing I found somewhat distracting was the noise level. It was extremely loud when the restaurant filled up. FOOD : On a scale of 1-10 , I give it an 8. We ordered a variety of dishes which we shared. I shall only mention the 3 that stood out for us.My friends raved about the chicken satay....the best ever eaten ! The generous pieces of grilled chicken meat were tender, juicy and spiced just right, served with a homemade peanut /pineapple sauce which was yummy! The Coronation chicken in a special sauce came in a cup of crispy wanton skins and the ngoh hiang ( 5 spice liver sausage roll ) both deserve special mention. The sayor lodeh ( mixed vegetable cooked in a mild spicy coconut gravy ) and the chap chye ( mixed vegetable with beancurd skin in prawn bisque with fermented salted soybean paste ) did not quite make the grade . COST: I have no gripes at all. I found prices to be reasonable for such an up-market restaurant. Average cost for Starters and Vegetables dishes SGD 12, Mains SGD 29 , Desserts SGD 10.50Peranakan food is best eaten on a shared basis . All dishes ordered are placed in the centre of the table to be shared by everyone, a good way of getting a tasting of everything. At the end of the meal The bill is then equally shared by the number of persons present which makes the whole eating experience not only enjoyable but very affordable.CONCLUSIONA great place to take foreign visitors to for a taste of Singapore local fare. Guaranteed they will go away full, impressed and happy. As for me, would I go back there again ? A resounding YES!!
5
Apparently the chef is a Singapore institution and indeed, the entire experience feels truly local and historical while being very classy, from the wonderful decor to the clasical Peranakan dishes. Peranakan food & culture not that easy to find in Singapore and if you want to seek it out, this is the one
4
unfortunately I came here alone. it's hard to get a reservation for dinner so I came for lunch and my friends were all working. Peranakan food is really meant for sharing so it limited the amount I could order. I tried the coronation chicken, abacus beads and beef rendang. the kuay pie tee was very popular at other tables but it was a big dish. Overall, I enjoyed the coronation chicken more. The abacus beads has a strong squid flavour which I don't mind (reminds me of some Taiwanese dishes) but others may find it objectionable. The beef was soft but very one-note. For dessert, I thought I'd try the Nonya lace pancakes which tasted like pancakes. Nothing special. I might try this place again with friends and try other dishes but sadly I wasn't that impressed. I've had Peranakan food at other restaurants and was very pleased with the different flavours but I didn't really enjoy this and if it was my only exposure to Peranakan cuisine, I probably wouldn't try it again, especially at this price point.The restaurant is gorgeous and you feel like you're in the movie Great Gatsby. Service is stellar. My ginger cocktail was very tasty

We ate here last night with friends/business colleagues. The venue, at the Singapore National Gallery, is lovely and the service was very good. We shared so many dishes (beef, chicken, prawn & vegetables) all of which were made with prime ingredients, were beautifully spiced, cooked and presented, aromatic and delicious. If you have room the desserts are wonderful. We can't wait to go back

Excellent Peranakan food in a beautiful, Art-deco style setting. Quick and efficient service (if a little brusque sometimes, but they were very busy on a late Sunday afternoon). Everything we ordered was excellent: kueh pie tee in their crisp shells and salty-sweet filling; thick, juicy chins of chicken satay in peanut-pineapple sauce; individually fried pieces of ngo hiang. For mains, we had beef rendang, butter prawns and sayur lodeh with nasi lemak rice and man tou. Everything was beautiful executed and delicious!We only had room for the tapioca cake with coconut cream for dessert but it was worth every bite. A delicious way to end the lunch.Bill came up to $220+ for everything plus drinks for 3 people. Highly recommended and a great place to bring tourists too.

After a visit to the National Gallery we managd to get a table to sample Violet Oon's Singaporean specialties. Chicken rice was great as were the superb starters and array of deserts. Lovely decor and beautifully designed china. Can't wait to go back !

Don't miss it: the decoration is incredible, very much early 20th century (see pics).
Tasty food, sophisticated but not too complex, with fresh and well mixed ingredients.
Perfect for couple or small family.
Visit the Gallery first, then lunch at Voilet Oon.

Beautiful space and incredible food! The perfect restaurant to be housed in the National Gallery Museum. Loved everything from the small details on the wall (the pristine 100+ year old vintage tiles to the photo tribute to chef Violet Oon) to the homemade unique iced tea. Particular food favorites included the Coronation chicken, Beef rendang, Beef cheek, Rojak, Chicken satay, and ending on a sweet note, the Upside down pineapple cake (literally served with a cherry on top)! Service was great and the experience was incredibly memorable. Highly recommend!

Certainly this place has the wow factor in terms of decor, small but beautifully done. We started with cocktails, which were quite nice. The food was delicious, we had a selection of starters and mains, and enjoyed everything but especially the satay. We all agreed that it truly was the best satay we have ever tasted! Wine list is small but is okay, room for improvement here. Staff was excellent, but the place shuts down quite early so if you are looking to longer on a Sat night, make plans for afterwards. We certainly recommend it and will come back especially with guests from overseas

We thought the food here was quite tasty, and that many of the dishes were authentic. We particularly enjoyed the beef rendang, which had been rendered so tender that you could slice through it just by poking it with a fork. Service was excellent. When the waiter heard that we didn't like one of the chicken dishes, he immediately swapped it out for another dish without asking questions. The restaurant is small and seating is a little bit tight. Noise level was high. It reminded me of a typical New York restaurant (but with some Peranakan tiles on the walls and handsome black and white interior design). Worth a visit if you want to try Peranakan food. A bit more expensive than your regular Peranakan restaurant though
4
Great peranakan cuisine served in an elegant restaurant with very friendly and helpful staff sums up the visit to National Kitchen!There is a private corner for 10-12 people which required a minimum spending of $500 which was really reasonable. We had a lovely dinner with traditional delicious belachan chilli. The desserts were great especially the pancakes with gula melaka (i forgot the name)! I would highly recommend it. For main/savoury, i enjoyed the Buah Keluak and Ngo Hiang a lot. Singapore Island Iced Tea is a very refreshing drink and not too sweet too!The staff were so friendly and attentive, quite a rare in Singapore now so please do keep up the good work!Will be back!

A great stroll through the Straits Chinese childhood. The balachan chilli and lime on the table at each place was a great start! Humorous and friendly service and really classy interior- like a cross between a British Gastropub and a kopi-tiam (Coffee house). Servings are not huge but well presented. Buah kuluah chicken is a must and getting difficult to get, but done really authentically- like Grandma used to do! The Kueh Pai tee is another great heritage dish- here it is light and not too greasy at all. Great views of the Padang from the window and meander your way slowly to the restrooms so that you can take in some of the art hangings

My nonya colleague and I wanted to try this peranakan restaurant out of curiosity. We like the National Gallery and had dinner at Odette in December. So this trip home, when she suggested the National Kitchen I readily agreed. Being a baba, I am skeptical when peranakan restaurants don't serve pork dishes like babi ponteh and my fave dishes like kuah lada. I read all the reviews and most were accurate. The ambience great, the food good but overpriced. My fears were confirmed by the numbers of foreigners dining there with buckets of white wine. The place was crowded and we had to wait at the bar. The wait was made more bearable with the excellent service standards of Raj, the tall bald ma√É¬Ætre de. And Kush, the super friendly waiter who recommended the excellent IPA Proper Job. We ordered at the bar and the food came when we had our table. The beef rendang, ngoh hiang, satay and ikan goreng were all palatable but not great. Would I go back again? Only when I'm entertaining foreign guests and to enjoy the service of Raj and Kush. Keep it boys, you have raised the service standards in Singapore.

Appetizers were kueh pie ti, which we find rather flat in taste.The satay, well marinated and chunky, came with a traditional peanut sauce with pineapple, absolutely delicious. We thought the sayur lodeh's broth was a tad thick, flavorful all the same. The beef rendang did not disappoint, tender and simmered in a thick gravy. Great service and ambience
5
The trouble with nyona (Peranakan) food is that the Peranakan always associates it with the stuff one is used to; mother's cooking, favourite roadside eatery etc. But every self-respecting nyona chef has his or her own take on any dish. It therefore helps to go with an open mind.We had a some coronation chicken (not really nyona as it was concocted in Britain for the Queen's coronation), satay, sayor lodeh and the beef cheeks. The satay portion was generously chunky, moist and accompanied with a sauce containing grated pineapple. The gravy on the sayor lodeh was, in comparison to the dishes elsewhere, thick. The beef was well braised and the accompanying sauce was a nice combination of spicy and sweet. We would go back just to have the various sauces with the fragrant rice.Yes, they tasted a little different from what we have had elsewhere but the dishes were absolutely delicious.The decor had echoes of a peranakan home; warm, slightly dark and noisy but no more noisy from any roadside coffeeshop that you will find in Singapore.Go for the food and the ambience. The art gallery right outside is a bonus. We have already made plans to return with a larger party

The restaurants environment is great but the space is limited and when you are sitting in the restaurant you will feel that people are very near beside you and the sound is loud.

fancy cosy decor , nice old school type desserts. fab service
but food very average.... i think the curry fish head taste better at my downstairs coffee shop.

Came here to celebrate Mum's birthday as she enjoys peranakan food. Staff were friendly and helpful. Provided a complimentary cake with a candle for Mum. Food portions are small, a little overpriced. Taste not fantastic but authentic. Nice ambience & decoration.
3
It's a stunningly beautiful restaurant, service is excellent, however I was a bit disappointed on the food. Maybe it's my palate but I couldn't really tell what made it special. The restaurant is quite noisy and I find it hard to carry a conversation amidst the noise.

Singapore is known as melting pot of many global cuisines. With so many tastes to choose from, it is refreshing that Singapore's own cuisine elevated itself up the culinary ladder with establishments like Violet Oon at the National Gallery.Firstly, one has to mention the venue. Singapore's National Gallery is a "must-do" stop for locals and tourists alike. Stunningly restored and enhanced with new additions and extensions, the design and the exhibits are nothing short of excellent. The venue houses a number of Restaurants including Violet Oon. Secondly, you will appreciate the friendly welcome from the service crew. Smiles and efficient service are seemingly present despite having a full house we felt very well looked after.Thirdly, the food. We sampled a number of dishes including the famous Dry Laksa which did not disappoint. The dry Laska was perfectly prepared and the presentation was immaculate. The Rojak was nicely balanced (ask for a more spicy version if you feel like a "local") and you will certainly enjoy an excellent Singaporean lunch or dinner.Most definitely worth a visit
4
I love the national gallery and the restaurants there, it's not too busy and the location is lovely. this restaurant has a charming old world feel and would be nice for a date. it serves mostly high end local dishes, I am not sure whether the food justifies the price but the lovely location certainly does. we had the beef cheek and laksa cod both were good but not exceptional
4
National Kitchen in the new National Gallery may suffer a little from the fact that reality rarely lives up to hype ‚Äì in this both about the restaurant and its founder, Violet Oon ‚Äì as something quite extraordinary in the world of Nyonya cuisine. The food was very fresh and good but, while everyone in our party likes chilli, there was a certain lack of variety in the flavours, everything coming in some kind of chilli sauce. Perhaps our selection was partly to blame. The well-known dish, Ayam Buah Keluak (keluak is Pangium edule, a fruit that is black when cooked and gives an indescribable flavour to meat) came with the keluak cut open so that you could decide just how much you wished to extract and mix into the sauce. It is certainly worth visiting and making up your own minds
4
I visited Violet Oon at the National Gallery on a friends recommendation. The restaurant is decorated beautifully and has a good atmosphere. We started off with a couple of Haliatini cocktails whilst sitting at the small bar. They were tasty and potent - just how I like my cocktails! The service was excellent and we enjoyed everything that Raj, the really helpful manager, recommended. I particularly liked the fried bean curd, chicken coronation cups, beef rendang, and chicken satay (the sauce is so good!). I'm looking forward to heading back when their outdoor space opens shortly. I would definitely recommend Violet Oon for a nice evening out

We needed a place to chill after our visit to the National Gallery Singapore. The first restaurant we saw was National Kitchen by Violet Oon. We arrived after the dinner crowd left. We got seated almost immediately. The Malay man, the service staff that greeted was very friendly. He told us that the food were all Halal. They are not Halal Certified by the Muslim council of Singapore because they served alcohol. That was of no issue for us. We just wanted a drink and some snack. We love the decor. It was classy but warm and cozy at the same time. We ordered the house brewed Ginger ale that was served with bits of Ginger and the Kesturi and Honey Soda (Lime juice with Soda). We loved the Kesturi and Honey Soda.Very refreshing. We had Kuay Pie Tie for our first choice of snack. Kuay Pie Tiee is something you must try if you patronized a Nyonya restaurant. Julienne bamboo shoot and turnip were served inside a 'Top Hat' and topped with prawn and served with 2 different sambal (chili sauce) and a sweet sauce. There were 8 pieces of Kuay Pie Tee per serving so my sister and I had 4 each. It was enough to fill our tummy.This is something every diner must try. It was really delicious. It was definitely love at first bite for us. Then we tried the Pulot Hitam (Glutinous rice)with Coconut ice-cream. The Pulot Hitam was not too sweet and eaten together with the coconut ice-cream was heavenly. The service was awesome. All the staffs were friendly and helpful. For lunch or dinner best to make reservation 3 days in advance to avoid disappointment.We will definitely return in future to try the rest of the meal on the menu. The diner at the next table ordered the Buah Keluak Noodle. It is buah keluak served with spaghetti. We have not seen that dish anywhere before and will definitely return to try it
4
Came here to celebrate friend's birthday. The place can be a bit cramp, and rather noisy when it is full. There is about five service staff and they can be slow at times when you want attention. Food is good, especially the beef rendang, Ngoh Hiang, fish head curry. Reservation is recommended if you want a table especially in the weeken
5
The food: excellent Peranakan fare, beautifully presented.
Good service, lovely Peranakan ambience with attention to detail. A small restaurant & is proving very popular. If you are looking for authentic nyonya food, look no further. This is it! But you need to book ahead.
4
Everything is matching to what you would expect in such a leading gallery in Asia and the reputation of Violet Oon from the setting, elegant design but yet cosy, good selection of menu, fine quality of food and service. It is a place to be returned especially the price was affordable
4
We came here after a really enjoyable and interesting visit to The National Gallery. The restaurant is in the City Hall Wing. We enjoyed the coronation chicken starter and a very good beef rendang at lunch time. Service was professional. The restaurant is beautiful - old colonial style. Recommended.
4
Lovely room (but freezing even by Singapore standards) and a good option to bring out of town guests not familiar with Singaporean favorites. Some dishes we loved (vegetarian rendang was really amazing), and others were so-so (rojak, dry laksa). Service was friendly and attentive. I'd definitely return with visitors, and next time will tour the National Gallery, which is really a beautiful building
4
Frankly I had heard poor reviews, but we came as the birthday girl insisted. We were very happy with fried laksa, hakka abacus, fish with chilli, kangkong, chicken bua keluak, tapioca dessert and ginger beer. We left feeling the restaurant is good if you can find the dishes you like. Based on reviews from other family members, we did not order certain dishes. The place is elegant if a little noisy. They have a lot of staff but they do not seem to be well trained to focus on a section of a few tables. It's not a large restaurant so when they open the patio outside, I think they will not be able to serve well? Just my guess
4
Given my so-so experience at Violet Oon's BukitTimah outlet, the National Kitchen was a pleasant surprise. The dining room exudes a luxurious colonial atmosphere but remains cozy. The cuisine is authentic. We liked most of the dishes we had - the creamy Coronation chicken In wantan leaf cup, the turmeric chicken wings exploding in flavour, the rich Daging Chabek beef cheek, the Buah Keluak Noodle. What disappoints a bit were the Kuay Pie Tee and the dry laksa. We will certainly go back for the Fish Head Curry which looks quite yummy from a neighbouring table. Friendly and very helpful waiters. Make sure to book, as the restaurant is small and is so good. Not too pricey given location and quality
4
Had lunch with ex-colleagues during a weekday and the restaurant was full. Our order was taken by a gentleman in plain clothes (whom I reckoned was the owner's son) who recommended a number of dishes for our party of 4.As the restaurant was full, orders took awhile to arrive but they were delicious. 2 of our dishes was missed out twice and on the 3rd time, 1 was still missed out from the order (not entered into ordering system), which was frustrating as we had reminded the staff and the gentleman.Food and decor was definitely worth visiting the restaurant for, but service has got to improve. I will give the restaurant another chance and visit on a less busy day
4
Newly opened in the refurbished former colonial era Courts of Justice in the middle of Singapore. The building itself is most interesting: huge spaces and very light. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated with ornate wall and floor tiles and colonial style furniture. Service was friendly and helpful but we needed to keep asking for refills of water. Am sure with time, this lack of attention will be rectified.The food was excellent: we started with the classic Peranakan snacks of satay (juicy chicken nicely grilled with the complete assortment of cucumber, onions and rice cake pieces), the Kway Pee Tie (with super large shrimp and optional chili sauce) and a nicely crafted rojak. Mains of beef rendang and cod in creamy laksa sauce were delicious
5
This the new place to go in Singapore, if you want to taste the original food of the Strait of Malaka, and the chinese and malaysian heritage of architecture and ambiance.The service is outstanding and the food presentation and taste is so authentic, thanks to Chef and Owner Violet Oon, an Icon in the culinary scene in Singapore
3
This is a charming little room with very well done Peranakan touches.The staff are very friendly and efficient.The place is already very popular at lunchtime so booking is advised.Sadly the food seems to have been dumbed down to virtual tastelessness.The fried chiken wings with turmeric had a slight kick but otherwise all our dishes were overly sweet and lacked oomph.This could be an absolute winner if Ms.Oon let the chefs use the spice rack abit more freely and put away the sugar bowl
