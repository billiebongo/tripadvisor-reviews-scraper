I ordered their degustation menu for dinner and was happy with all 4 courses.
Everything was fantastic, especially the steak which was cooked perfectly tender and soft.
4
Celebrated my friend’s birthday at the restaurant on a Monday night. Week nights are usually less crowded, hence a quieter environment for talking. Liked the well spaced out tables and wide comfortable chairs. Food is awesome. Happy to be back again.
5
Went there a few times for business lunch. Good ambience, friendly customer service and good food quality, value for money.
4
The food was delicious! Please try the burrata cheese bruschetta and linguine with langoustine in Gorgonzola sauce.
We missed some atmosphere since the place was nearly empty on a Saturday evening at 8pm.

food was very good and especially the service was great! I'll be back in this restaurant for sure!!!

My boyfriend and I have been to fair share of Italian restaurants in US and Singapore. PerBacco is by far the best Italian restaurant in town. The food was authentic -- even the extra virgin olive oil is sourced from Italy. We had the Spaghetti with truffle oil and uni. The dish was amazing. The uni adds creamy texture and depth to the flavorful truffle sauce. We also ordered the pizza. It was the best thin crust pizza we had in Singapore. Thanks for the amazing meal. We would definitely go there again.
5
My first visit to this restaurant. I had to say that my all time favorite Italian restaurant will now becoming no.2, PerBacco will now be my new no.1 favorite! Tried their bruschetta, braised shredded lamb & lobster meat pasta. They are all amazingggggg. Not to forget to end it with a very smooth panna cotta topped with hazelnut, what a best combi Leave it to the excellent chef Marco, I'm sure you won't be disappointed! Yums

Came here with my parents on a Saturday night. The service and atmosphere were lovely. My dad and I ordered a glass of wine each. My mum didn't want any alcohol but they surprised us by giving her a very nice mocktail! Started with raw oysters which were fresh and juicy - yum! Then had the baked eggplant and mozzarella which the chef very nicely cut into smaller portions for us to share. Very delicious as well. Before the main courses arrived we decided to add the mussels which they accommodated very well. The mussels were tasty and the white wine sauce was so flavourful! They also split the dish into three portions which made the soup so much easier to share - very thoughtful! For the main course my dad had the beef tenderloin. The meat was such good quality and cooked to medium rare perfection. My mum and I shared the angel hair pasta which they also very nicely split into two portions. There was plenty of crab meat, tomato and asparagus in the pasta dish and it was just heavenly. We spent $220 in total and there was more than enough food. It was a really enjoyable evening! Oh and even the bread and olive oil were excellent. It's apparent that a lot of thought and effort are put into each dish they serve and I will be coming back.
5
I've been a few times for dinner and just for drinks. The service is great. It's fun and cozy. The food is wonderful too. They even have a couple gluten free options. The bartender is flexible and can make accommodations for allergies. I love going here on a weeknight! Great treat in the middle of the week :).

Average food, empty on a Friday night. Booked 9 pm since website said open til 11:30. 10:30 handed the check. Lights up, air off, music off shortly after being kicked out
5
Excellent service and Delicious dishes!!! I would like to recommend the nice "ristorante" to others.
5
This is one of the best italian restaurants in SG. The brusquetta is one of a kind. Pasta is fresh and flavours are really unique. Excellent food and service. We were puzzled by the fact it was not crowded given its quality.
5
I love salmon and there Salmon Timbale is definitely one of the best!
Surely I will come again and try more on their menu's.
Price is worth it plus good ambiance!
4
Been here a couple of times. Loved their authentic Italian food. Returned here twice this month as they have 1 for 1 pasta promotion in June. Loved their clams and crab angel hair squid ink pasta! Wine was reasonable price too. The dessert was fantastic!
5
The staff here are all very friendly and the lunch menu they have is a great value for money. Nice quiet atmosphere suitable for business meetings.
5
I will only say that I have been in Tanjong Pagar since 1997 and I have to say when I saw the young Chef Mr Marco Fregnan I was really seeing a man of Passion and the great dishes he gave to us , we were 4 people and I like for you to taste the food and make him proud , the dish in bread done to perfection , the heavenly oysters that my business partners just rave about.. well I am blown away and let me not tell too much ..for someone who wants to taste the real dishes of Italy and see this man whom You will see a million dollar smile and his skills is cultured from the Culinary Goddess ..try it and I promise you You will say ...why have I not come here before 
5
We had a very nice and pleasant evening with friends. The food made by a young but talented chef is excellent and is modified according to your wish (although the dishes could be a big bigger). The service was excellent and we enjoyed very much also desserts. A place we will definitely return
4
Nice Italian food. We tried their oysters, pasta, lamb rack, steak and panna cotta... all very nice. I will go back again and recommend this to our friends. While the service is good overall I would like to suggest the delivery of our meals could be a little quicker as it took us over 3 hours to finish our 3 course dinner.
4
Per Bacco located at 20 Craig Road Tanjong Pagar, it has lovely Ambiance, personal attention, and great service blended with an Italian menu. It is one of the Singapore premier dinning with equal measures of unique quality and first-rate authentic Italian cuisine. Would highly recommend Per Bacco to any-one who enjoys great Italian food & hospitality at fantastic value! After numerous recommendations I decided to try this place & wasn't disappointed. The menu was great & it was hard to narrow down my selection. Staff were attentive & the food was delicious. Some of the tastiest Italian food I've eaten in SGP. Unfortunately after all that food we were just too full to try the desserts, which I'm sure must be delicious. The prices are definitely high, especially for the wine, but I guess that is the way in Singapore everything is quite inflated. However with such an exquisite experience we are looking forward to going back soon
5
The atmosphere is lively and vibrant.The captains have been impeccable serving us.The boss, Soon Kai has been generous spending his time explaining to us in details how the food is prepared exquisitely and how he takes in customers feedback diligently so as to make the dining experience in PerBacco awesome yet affordable.Truly so
4
Lovely food in good ambiance and great location. Very worthwhile a good selection, wine, service....
5
I went there one week ago: the ambient is casual but nice, great food and good presentation of the dishes. The pizza with burrata is a must, the tiramisu is dense and yummy. Chef Marco did a good job with his Team. Bravi
5
Set lunch , Set dinner are super great deal value for $. Food quality is really good. Must try.
Ambience is good. Romantic dinner or family gathering. Great for all occasion.
5
Great food, beautifully presented. Staff were excellent and professional. We had the mussels, sea urchin pasta and lamb - all were excellent.
5
This is one of our favourite restaurants. We ordered the roast lamp rack and the sea urchins pasta, plus the charcuterie salad. The ingredients were fresh, well prepared and beautifully presented. Well worth a visit!
4
I had a wonderful evening and service by the team was attentive and unobtrusive. I had my warm water refilled without a need to remind them.As a familiar face, I received complimentary drinks. The pasta came in thoughtful half-portions and the special grilled pork collar was beautifully charred
4
As we were a group, the owner SK recommended a variety of food for us to try. We had parma ham with fresh burrata, mussels, oysters, lobster asparagus ravioli, sea urchin spaghetti, pizza and desserts such as hazelnut panna cotta and coconut tiramisu. The sea urchin is from Hokkaido and were really fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed the crunchy, whole hazelnuts with the panna cotta. Very attentive staff. All in all, a pleasant dining experience
4
We went to Per Bacco after work on a Friday, and it was still rather empty. We were seated in a nice table and the service was good throughout the evening. The food was very nice, but it did take a while to bring out to us, and that made us eat more of the complimentary bread dipped in olive oil.We had some oysters for appetizers, and then lobster ravioli and pappardele with shredded lamb for our first plates. For our main dishes, we had the char grilled angus beef ribeye and the veal ossobuco. From all these dishes, we enjoyed the veal ossobuco and the pappardele the most. The ribeye was nice but I've had better steak and let's face it...not hard to get a good ribeye. The lobster ravioli was not up to par with the other dishes, and for 4-raviolis for SGD18, I would pass next time. The price for all of this with two beers was almost SGD190...Ouch! Not something that I want to do every week
5
Perbacco our local Italian favourite we love the wine,oysters & my favourite Papadella pasta with braised shredded lamb.DIVINE!!Then you cannot eat anymore but Waitthe panacotta with hazelnuts is delicious & best I've had.. We Take all our friends & visitors here as also the staff are very personal & helpful.Great for a drink at the bar with oysters or antipasto then sit in the restaurant for your main. Great ambience prices for Singapore.A must do!!!!
4
I would rate Perbacco with a 3.5 rating. My experience was 'good' but not 'very good' as a 4 rating indicates. It was a dinner for 2 at a nice table in what is a nice bistro. Food was good, though portions weren't the biggest. The lobster pasta was nice, but not great. The cod was good. The panna cotta and the tiramisu were decent. Wine was nice at around $20+ per glass for a decent Amarone. I must say that that was nice to to be able to order Amarone by the glass. Perbacco would be a good place for dinner and a great place for drinks
5
The burrata is to die for. My second time in this restaurant and its impeccable service and delicious food from this place!
5
I have been here a few times now and have never been disappointed. The atmosphere is always great and have yet to find better pasta anywhere in town.
5
Authentic Italian food, great service and welcoming ambience. The risotto served straight out of a cheese wheel was awesome, and most importantly, yummy. Was there for a work lunch, but will be back for more!
5
food was great - pasta was authentic and just right
ambience was nice - tables were well spaced with feature ornaments placed around the establishment, loved the decor
service was great - staff were very friendly and service was prompt
5
Gorgeous ambience, authentic food. Last night's special was a porcini risotto, dalla forma preparation.. warm, cheesy and delicious!
5
This is one of the rare moments that my family agree to go to an Italian restaurant, and love it too! Perbacco has a very welcoming, warm ambience that relaxes you. My party was warmly welcome by the staff, and service throughout was very good. Our plates were promptly changed every meal, and our water glass never ever 1/2 empty. The food is authentic Italian with no fuss. It seems like freshly made pasta is one of strength of the kitchen, and we ordered a few dishes. They were all delicious. My favorite is the Bucatini with Anchovies, Olives & Garlic. Somehow it has the right combination that's makes it very yummy! I love lamb, and the roasted lamb didn't disappoint. It was flavorful, lean and tender, cooked to perfection. Portions were generous and we were all stuffed. But we couldn't resist the recommendation of the lava cake. It was heavenly. We were a party of 5, and we ordered 11 dishes!!! The bill came up to be very reasonable, that I would say it is a great deal. Great place for a lovely, quiet Italian meal!
4
That was really a great surprise to find an original italian taste in Spore. Very nice decoration with lots of space and great design. Not a very extensive menu but morr than enough tp give you ad many choices as you need. Also liked the option to have half portion for cases you do not feel really hungry or having kids with you. Pellegrino sparkling water with some smooth white wines is all you need for a complete meal course. Will return for a biz lunch break for sure
5
I would classify this as a mid-range restaurant in terms of budget, but the food they serve is definitely not of the mid-range standard - it's comparable to the offerings at higher-end restaurants. We've been consistently impressed with the appetisers, the pastas and the mains, and have comfortably settled for it as our to-go for Italian food in Singapore. Pleasant ambience, the owner SK is lovely, and the staff is always very sweet to our little one. We've visited with family and with friends, and no one ever leaves with anything negative to say
5
I had lunch there a few weeks ago, and I felt that both the food and the atmosphere was great! There was a cheese wheel as well (which was yummy), and a good selection of cocktail and alcohol mixes. The owner was very friendly as well
5
The pastas I ordered at my previous visits didn't disappoint, so this time I tried something different - oven baked cod fish in Catoccio style. Accompanied with prawns and squids, they were all cooked in sauce made with Prosecco (Italian white wine). The tenderness of the cod fish goes without saying. The sauce was heavenly, evident by my scooping it up till the last drop.A dish that deserves mention is one I tried in my previous visit -- the citrus scented grilled whole European sea bass. The owner of the restaurant shared with us the secret of the cooking -- the fish was cooked using two styles, the skin grilled to golden crispiness while locking the juiciness of the fish inside. We also ordered the Gourmet Pizza to share - yomato, mozzarella, fennel pork sausage, gorgonzola cheese and onion. The melding of the cheese and onion was delightful.Service was prompt, even at times when the restaurant was busy. Waiters and waitresses were knowledgeable and out to please. A very pleasant and satisfying dinner we had
5
Had a great night feasting on oysters, Burrala cheese, homemade tagliatelle duck ragout, mussels and delicious Italian wines. We will surely be back!!
5
I was there for lunch & had Scottish Smoked Salmon & Pan Seared Sea Bass Fillet - which were satisfying.
5
Went twice and this place has hands down the best pastas and risotto I've had in Singapore. Across the board the pastas were all cooked perfectly, and every sauce was vibrant and married well with the noodles: their lamb sauce was generous and had very tender chunks of meat; their lobster carbonara had a lovely sauce that was rich without being cloying and had lobster that was springy and tender. The carbonara is definitely one of their highlights. The foie gras risotto was precisely al dente with the wonderfully seared foie gras providing a nice velvety contrast to the risotto. The bar serves, off the menu, probably one of the best martinis with a twist I've ever had. Food aside, it's a very cosy and intimate place at night and is a great place to bring friends and/or lovers. Will be heading down again soon
4
Had the Amex 1 for 1 main which was very worth it for the ribeye steak that cost $48 without the promo. Had the set lunch fish filet which was great too. Ordered some oysters which was nice not great but service staff gave us complimentary prosecco to go along.
5
Came here a few times with my girlfriends and I'd absolutely recommend their $1.50 oyster and prosecco as starters, to be followed by uni pasta (not to be missed!) and truffle pizza for main course. Experience was great and food was always excellent! Will definitely come back again
5
It was a 3-generation family lunch and we decided to have a go at all the pastas on the menu. They were all great so everyone has their own favorite & mine is split between the ' bucatini pasta with anchovies, olives & garlic chips', a non-creamy taste that transported me back to Italy there & then; and the 'spaghetti with truffles emulsion & fresh sea urchins', a creamy East-West fusion.. I will definitely go back for more
5
The waitress was extremely patient with us. We had a large group of people ordering a heck load of food. There was also that one instant we accidentally spilled water and she reacted almost immediately, cleaning it up swiftly. The food arrived rather quickly as well. I did not remember waiting long for it. A good place to check out
5
As compared to neighbouring restaurants, Perbacco is not that well known suprisingly. It definitely deserves to rank high up there as "one of top ten" as it serves unpretentious Italian food that is simply delighting to the palate. We keep going back for the angel hair pasta with uni, spinach pasta with cavier & rissoto with foie gras. Another highly recommended dish is the grilled sea bass. The design is another wow factor. Overall excellent & almost perfect if the music selection can be more updated.
5
I've been to Perbacco a couple of times, and it's been great every time! Atmosphere and decoration is amazing, service is excellent, and prices are reasonable as well. Would recommend their pizza - big portions, generous amounts of cheese and meat! meat!! - as well as the bruschetta. Their bartender is also very intense about what he makes (in a good way), and the drinks that he makes are pretty good. Ask him to make you a special drink, and enjoy
5
A positive dining experience. Despite arriving for lunch in a big group, we did not have to wait too long for the food, having ordered in advance. A great place for corporate dining and group gatherings as the place was quite spacious and the tables were well-spaced. Service was prompt and attentive. The ingredients were fresh and I asked about the source of PerBacco’s cherry tomatoes which were really sweet. I was told that they were imported directly from Italy.In terms of accessibility, parking was convenient as there’s a multi-storey car park in the same building. I was told that Tanjong Pagar MRT Station was within walking distance
5
Great place for couples and group dinner. Chef Marco is from North Italy. Pizza is great! Leave room for desserts! Good selection of Italian wine. My personal favorite is the extra dry Prosecco Aldobbiadene
5
Great Italian food, wifed loved the fresh oysters, pizza and the lamp were also excellent. Won't be long till we return.
5
Perbacco offers reasonably priced food for fantastic food. The ambience is perfect for all occasions, business or just chilling with friends or for family meals.
5
Special shout out to service staff Julie for being so friendly and cheerful. Pizza is a must try. Made fresh!
5
I'll admit I've walked past quite a number of times on my way to work without having gone in. I only went in recently to give it a shot because I was taken aback by the interesting menu. I'm very glad I did- PerBacco was a wonderful surprise and I have gone back nearly every fortnight since then! The atmosphere is impeccable. I love bringing friends here because of the intimate setting and beautiful decoration, as well as the friendly and professional service staff. Definitely a place that has learned to be impressive without being imposing. Food is delicious. Possibly the most exciting yet elegant range of pastas and pizzas I've seen. At lunch time you can get their amazing lunch pasta for just under $13, or a whole main / pizza for just under $17. You'd expect them to scrimp on the quality or quantity, but you get full portions of delicious food. Perfect for a quick and satisfying lunch. That said, I can almost never resist their A la Carte menu. The Bucatini with Anchovies is my go-to surprise for foodies and Italian friends -they are charmed by the Venetian authenticity and the delicate sweetness of the anchovies. For friends with a taste for something creamier, I recommend the Pennette Lobster Carbonara -the secret is in the sauce, which is made by adding Lobster Bisque to the standard Carbonara ingredients. My personal favorite is the fresh Pappardelle with Lamb Ragout. The lamb is tender and complements the firm pasta incredibly well. In large groups, we go for the pizzas. Personally I recommend the Truffle Pizza and Gourmet Pizza for something special. Otherwise, the Pizza Parma Ham is generous and elegant. The mains are fantastic as well -for a special meal, order their 'half portion' pasta followed by their lamb rack or tenderloin. Complete your meal with some of their fantastic house pours. The clincher for me was when I wanted a glass of red to go with my tenderloin and discovered that they sell Cesare Amarone at $25 per glass. The helpful staff explained to me that this is enabled by some special machine to keep the wines fresh, allowing them to serve top quality wines as house pours. I didn't understand the technology, but was glad to benefit from it!Definitely would recommend giving this place a chance. You'll find you can have a top quality meal at extremely reasonable prices
5
I return to PerBacco for 3 things -: confit tomato burrata cheese bruschetta, hazelnut panna cotta and the tarufata pizza! This place offers the best oyster deal in town - $1.50 all day long, no limit to the quantity per table; its fresh and good size oysters. Pairs really well with the extra dry Prosecco Valdobbiadene.
5
PerBacco is an institution among my friends--one that I am more than happy to partake! The service staff is attentive, and the food is amazing! I recommend ordering the bruschetta (the burrata cheese on top is to die for!), truffle pizza (nom! nom!), truffle uni pasta (go for the full portion!), and any of the mains (especially the lamb!). The house wines are superb, and the staff is always happy to recommend pairings. Come for happy hour, all-night oysters, business lunch, family dinner, date night--seriously, any occasion is perfect at PerBacco. If you're lucky, you might encounter the gregarious and upbeat owner, who never fails to entertain us with one of his many funny anecdotes. Just the cherry on top of an already great experience! We'll see you soon!
5
I was looking forward to my second visit there since the superb dining experience previously. We went for lunch today and once again I was not disappointed. The food was excellent!! We started with the minestrone soup which was light and flavorful. The ravioli has always been my favorite and this time we had the juicy lobster ravioli. I had the Spaghetti Tartufo & Riccio di Mare. It was springy and the mix of sea urchin and sauce was heavenly. We also tried the pizza cabonara. It has generous amount of toppings and cheese over a thin crispy and chewy crust. I cant wait to try the others. For dessert, we had the chef signature apple and cinnamon cake that comes with a scoop of ice cream. Just writing this review makes me wanna go back right now.............The atmosphere is great coupled with attentive staff. Definitely shall make plans to re-visit the place for the 3rd time
5
Went over for a birthday celebration and shared many dishes. We love seafood and the friendly staff suggested the bucatini with anchovies, scampi linguine in gorgonzola sauce and the uni spaghetti. All the pastas were delicious (personal favourite is the sea urchin spaghetti with truffle ) We enjoyed eating in a cozy corner of the spacious restaurant a lot! Would like to thank the team for being so attentive and the chef for personally bringing out the pizza for us to share!
5
I was skeptical when I first visited Perbacco mid of last year, thought it was some mediocre food that over-charged, but it turned out of my expectation and I have been going back regularly ever since. The food is simply awesome, they use premium, fresh quality ingredients yet with reasonable prices. Love their all their pastas, especially the fresh Uni pasta and Spinach pasta with Sicilian prawn and caviar, simply divine ! Their Grilled Seabass is fantastic. Another must try is their dessert - Hazelnut Panna Cotta, I am drooling now thinking of it ! But if you want something simple, all their pizzas are great too . Service is awesome, friendly service staffs and a charming , personalized Owner who will go around making sure his customers' requests are met and feel at home. Great restaurant!
5
Awesome place with amazing pizzas! Good vibes and music! The service staff is also extremely helpful and friendly!
5
Perbacco is one of those beautiful Italian restaurants in Singapore that screams elegance and sophistication. Yet, unlike them, Perbacco houses a fleet of warm and professional staff, and a charismatic owner that makes you feel right at home. The menu consists of a variety of pastas and secondis which are very innovative and makes you want to order all of them - foie gras risotto, sea urchin and black truffle emulsion pasta...you get the drift. And they offer these in half portions at half the price, so one can order many dishes and get a taste of everything their hearts desire! My personal favorite is the uni and truffle pasta. Few places can get this right, especially in Singapore where good uni is hard to find (and we all know how yucky bad uni can be...). And with two strong components such as uni and black truffle, it was a glorious marriage of flavors instead of one outcompeting each other! The bruschetta with dollops of burrata and stewed tomatoes was heavenly as well, served on warm toasted breads. They are currently offering fin du claire oysters for $1.50 per pc, which is a steal. As for wine, their white house wine is very good, especially in Singapore where the house wine is usually bad. Definitely one of my new favorite spots
5
I went to Perbacco through a friend's recommendation. True enough, the food suits my palette, delicious and interesting combination of fresh seafood and ingredients makes me yearn to go back and try more and more of their dishes, I have been going back there and never fails to delight me as a satisfied customer. The chilled spinach hair with 'Mazara' prawn is a must try. They serve the freshest raw seafood and the spaghetti with sea urchin is so flavorful , I always order it when I am there. I am going back for more 
5
Wonderful dining experience with 3 other girlfriends last night. The ambiance was warm and cozy, staff was attentive and accomodating and the food was oh-so-good! We had pan seared Octopus leg and Smoked salmon with Burrata chesse and cherry tomatoes as appetizers, Vegetarian mushroom cheese pizza (off the menu as it was specially requested to the chef), Chilled Spinach Angel hair pasta with caviar, Lobster Ravioli and Smoked grilled European Sea bass. Such a treat for the tastebuds and I can't wait to go back for more
4
I had initially wanted to list out all the food that we ordered but decided otherwise because the restaurant serves food which are consistently good given the numerous occasions that my friends and I have been there. No complaints, only praises. Service was prompt and excellent. The owner was chatty and engaging. And the ambience was just simply grea
5
Went there on a Sat night with a friend at her recommendation. It was a great experience! Food was hearty and delicious, well-complemented by the wine pairings suggested by the owner. Pricing was reasonable as well. I find the owner's personal touches in trying to engage his customers an endearing feature of this restaurant. Will definitely be back again with friends and family
5
I have been to this Craig Road area many times, and to neighbouring Binomio a couple of times, but never noticed this restaurant until someone brought me there.The food was really quite good, and the service excellent. I tried mixed cold cut. Oysters were $1.50 each. I also had the panettone and hazel nut Panna cotta. And of course the charcoal grilled meat comprising angus tenderloin and lamb rack.They also sell Italian wines like Amarone, Barolo and Brunello by the glass. And some house pours. But I am not a wine drinker so I do not know much about wine.It is best you go and try the food yourself!This place is opposite an antique shop that proclaims "We buy junk and sell antique. Some fools buy some fools sell"!!
5
The closest to authentic Italian cuisine you'll get in Singapore and at an affordable price too! Great cozy space which is accessible yet tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the main road. With a great selection of wine and beer to go with proper Italian pizza, this will be a regular haunt for us.
5
I'm not usually a pasta-loving person but Per Bacco offers one of the best Italian pastas I've tasted in Singapore. Their Pennette alla Carbonara di Astice is a personal favourite and is certainly a pasta I can never get sick of! The restaurant offers complimentary fresh and crisp bread that I enjoy too, to accompany your meals. In all, I think Per Bacco offers an extraordinary Italian cuisine in Singapore (a rare find) and along with their supremely friendly and attentive staff, I'm always eager to come visit again!
5
Such a classy and welcoming place. Was highly impressed by the maitre 'D (efficient and charming) as well as the chef, whom we had the honour of meeting face-to-face upon invitation by the restaurant owner. Whether it's a romantic night or a hearty dinner with old friends, you can rest assured that PerBacco's will deliver a warm welcome :))) Lots of great memories to be had here
5
I loved the service perbacco provided us and the food as well! I recommend their burrata as well as their risottos!
5
Amazing food and excellent service! Have been here many times and never disappointed. Will definitely be back again!
5
great food! especially the pasta with black truffle and fresh sea urchin. The pizza was superb as well. definitely worth another trip :-)
5
Perbacco never disappoints. The quality of food was amazing as usual, and service was always superb. Staff Polina was kind and attentive and catered to all our needs and requests without any complaints. Boss Soon Kai was a delight and never fails to chat with us whenever we pay a visit to his restaurant.Perbacco is definitely of one the better, or shall I say best, Italian restaurants in Singapore. This is our 5th visit in 3 months and the service and food has always been consistent and outstanding.Every item on the menu was amazing. Today we had the seared octopus leg and smoked salmon with cheese timbale for appetizers, chargrilled pork collar and gourmet pizza for our mains. For dessert, we opted for the hazelnut panna cotta, it's easily my favourite dessert ever! Their panna cotta was very different from the offerings by other restaurants, it was rich without being heavy, a lovely balance.Overall, dinner was outstanding as usual, and we will be sure to visit within the next month to get our Italian fix
5
Let's get this off my chest... the boss-man here says I'm biased; but seriously, the food and service is by far level beyond most places on Craig and the neighbouring Tanjong Pagar area! Delicious Venuto- based Italian food with just the touch of fancy that beats other Italian restaurants around these parts! The best bit is that you might be served by the owner or his kids... it's mind blowing that kids can be that grounded and cool, as to help their dad with his passion! Kudos and specs to the owner and his kids! Superlative food with a home/ family restaurant vibe to it! Who could ask for more? I'm a complete total fan! And a special shout out to Polina (hope I got the spelling right) ... amazing server with a lovely lovely personality! J'adore! Come one come all! Worth the taste! Will be back definitely!Arthur
4
Enjoyed a couple of drinks and a pizza each here and although quite pricey for us as backpackers, this was a treat and the pizza was very nice. We had viewed the menu online previously so when it differed to the one in the restaurant, we were still able to have the pizza from the online menu. Nice friendly service and also complimentary bread and oils
5
Went to Perbacco for the second time on March. First time was my friends birthday and second, my 19th birthday celebration. The restaurant has the nicest Waiters and Waitresses in town! Absolutely amazing food! Burrata cheese is highly recommended! So fresh!! Not to forget the steak.... Can eat that Everyday! Highly recommended restaurant. They will take care of everything. Can't wait to be back! So satisfied
5
One dish after the other... each better than the previous! What can I say, the food was top grade! My favourite being the mussels with cherry tomatoes and herbs!! All snapped up within minutes! Boy, every dish was friggin good! Two thumbs up! Food aside, service was tip top too! The staff were very considerate and took really good care of my kids too! Thank you PerBacco, we will be back, soon
5
Great Italian restaurant to unwind and enjoy authentic Italian cuisines.The place has a nice and warm ambience with ample sitting capacity.The staffs are very friendly and helpful with the food recommendations. We had the Vellutata ai Funghi (Mushroom Soup) to start off followed bya selection of Italian Charcuterie and Cold Cuts (Affetato Misto). The variety of the cuts were good and they were skilfully sliced to paper thin portions. Next we had some Confit Tomato and Burrata Cheese Bruschetta.The bruschetta is refreshing and light, perfect for opening up your appetite. For mains, we ordered a Char Grilled Angus Beef Ribeye (with Marsala Sauce) and the chef-recommended PerBacco pizza topped with Mozzarella, Sun Dried Tomato, Crab Meat and Chilli. The steak was tender and juicy while the pizza was baked on a thin crusts with a generous spread of ingredients. Certainly we were not disappointed by the staff's recommedations.For dessert, we had the restaurant's signature “PerBacco” Tiramisu. The servings were light, lush and creamy and it was certainly a great way to sign off a great night of dining. Highly recommended Italian restaurant both in terms of great ambience and fanastic food quality 
5
Was there for lunch yesterday and was very impressed with the quality of food served. Great ambience with very friendly boss, checking up on us to make sure all was good.The lunch menu is pocket friendly and value for money compared to other Italian restaurants

Food - brilliant . Ambience - brilliant. Wine - brilliant. Nothing much else to say .
Recommend everyone to have the uni truffle pasta - (you guessed it ) brilliant...

Great restaurant. Great service. Service staff was a little too eager to serve us though. Food was amazing. It was a day before Valentine's Day and I received a rose from the staff. Thank you!
5
Was recommended by my friend to try this rest. Experience was great and food was excellent!! Will definitely come back again.

I like the decor of the restaurant. Quality of food is good. One of the nicer chicken cutlet tried. As there is no lunch crowd, we received almost full attention. It will be great if they have lunch set in future.
4
We've been there many times for dinner and we are always pleased with the food and the friendly and attentive staff.We tried pizzas, pasta, meat,... always nicely cooked with fresh and tasty ingredients.This time we chose the veggie pizza with an egg and the beef steak with marsala sauce.The complementary bread is very nice.Maybe you can skip the desserts, usually too sweet for our liking.But definitely a nice place to go

Being Valentine's Day I wanted to go somewhere special and my #1 go-to place is PerBacco. Because I like everything about it: the food, the wine, the ambience, the Italian Chef, the service and even the parking is easy. If it were a tad closer to my place, I would hang out there a lot more.I was there last August so it was a sweet surprise when the staff welcomed my return with 2 glasses of complimentary prosecco. Marco, the gentle, smiling chef came over and chatted with us some; it's nice to know the creator of the the menu. There were some changes in the menu but I never fail to order my all-time favorite appetizer, octopus with a side salad. The octopus may look kind of funny but the taste is out of this world. I asked for a green salad, rather than the potato one stated, thinking the waiter would have to check with the kitchen but he obliged right away. Since service in Singapore is mostly found wanting, a thinking waiter deserves high praise. Another dish worthy of mention is the mussels, which is cooked in heavenly broth.Knowing that we were sharing everything, the mussels were served in 2 bowls. We attacked the mussels greedily, drinking the broth to the very last drop. Yum!I was presented with a rose even it though we were there for lunch. Apparently, boss's wife took time to trim out the thorns. How considerate was that
5
I have been visiting Perbacco for a while following a friend's recomendation. Each time the service level and food quality is better than the previous. Wonder how they manage to maintain the standard which I don't see elsewhere. Kudos to the team and this is why I keep going back. Oh.. the wine selection is one of a kind
5
Chef Marco is a fiercely passionate Italian chef who does not stinge on freshness of the ingredients and portions. The carefully planned menu is sublime. Every morsel melts in your mouth. Ambience is stylish yet relaxed. Service is attentive and efficient but not intrusive. Good selection of wine. Very conducive for parties and functions at heart of business district. All in all, great value for money. Can't quite ask for more
5
Great Steak and pastaI asked for a medium done steak. The results could not have been more perfect. The succulent sweet meat San the dripping blood associated with medium done steak. The pasta with its various sauce were nice. Ask for the salmon pasta. Will not regret
5
Visited Perbacco for the first time in Dec last year.Perbacco serves up the best of North Italian food.And because it does not stinge on cream, butter and cheese, my two tweenage daughters say the food rocks.The journey through the various touchpoints eg queueing up, waiting to be served, being introduced to menu items, interaction with the service staff and settling the bills has also been smooth and pleasant. A very enjoyable dining experience, in which for once my wife agrees
5
I like the food, the ambience, the people. Will visit them often. Just waiting to surprise my wife with a romantic evening.
5
Had a great time with the family at PerBacco, love the food quality and authentic flavours!

Nice Italian restaurant at craig road. Cozy atmosphere. Food generally very good and well prepared. The angus beef is a must try. Their risotto are very nice too.
5
Its definitely an awesome restaurant to visit, be it private couple, or romantic fining dining at night. The food is delicious, as well as the staffs are observant and attentive. The restaurant has a nice compromise between a dark wood traditional type Italian restaurant and the new style modern Italian cuisine. I really appreciate the decorations, which builds up a cozy ambiance for dining. A restaurant worth vising, and never would they ever disappoint
5
The best Italian restaurant to hook up with friends old and new. Excellent wine and food with the perfect ambiance to go with. Very friendly owner can help with the menu in English, French, German, Italian, Bahasa and Chinese to make you feel right at home
5
My friends and I loved the place for our recent gathering there! The food was great! Authentic Italian cuisine. And a good selection of wine! And very friendly and attentive waitering services.And the boss adds that extra touch to actively mingle and engage the restaurant guests.Will make it one of my regular hangouts for gatherings and family dinners!Keep up the great job Perbacco
5
Perbacco is a well decorated restaurant with a modern touch. Spacious and airy, it is a place to enjoy great food with friends and family without noisy chatter intruding into our conversation. The staff, including the chef (who, I understand, is Italian), are warm and friendly, really fantastic with their services. The food serving is generous and quality absolutely, delightful. Ask for the off-menu treat too! Personally, given the quality, it is really value for money
5
Had dinner with a friend on a weekday evening. Staff was helpful and service attentive. Ambience was casual and intimate, perfect for a quiet dinner with friends and family. Good variety on the menu. I chose a bucatini with anchovies. Bucatini is a thicker spaghetti with a hole running through the centre. The taste was excellent with the strong flavour of the anchovy well balanced by the caramelised onions. My friend was equally pleased with his spaghetti in sea urchin sauce. The desserts were great as well. The panna cotta with hazelnuts had crunchy whole hazelnuts lightly toasted complementing the smooth creamy panna cotta. Overall, a wonderful experience at a reasonable price by Singapore standards. Would definitely go back agai
5
Awesome ambience, fantastic for a small cosy meal with close friends friends or even a huge gathering with family or colleagues! Perbacco can make all kinds of arrange! They have an array of Italian food! A must try is the mix grilled seafood platter! Good to share with 4-5 pax. There were langoustines, scallops, squid and the best of all, grilled mediterranean sea bass! Forget about dieting when you are there
5
My family of 5 enjoyed ourselves tremendously as the food was fantastic! We enjoyed the warm bread and the crispy thinly sliced garlic bread. We ordered 6 half portions from the 8 courses of primi piatti. Each pasta dish was a winner as the ingredients were of high quality and the taste was fantastic. If you love carbonara sauce, the penne w lobster meat was so rich and creamy, one of the nicest carbonara sauce I've tasted. My husband found the risotto cooked in Amarone wine his favourite, one of the best risottos he has ever tried (after going to 20+ Italian restaurants). The antipasti, the crabmeat croquette and the burrata cheese were very great too! The Ossobucco, the veal, was very nicely done too. The chef prepared a dessert trio for us, the cinnamon and apple, hazelnut pannacotta and the creme brûlée. We had a complimentary tiramisu as a birthday cake. Service was good and the prices were reasonable.
3
The place has good ambience and good service, oozing of warmth and friendliness. The food variety is limited, wish there could be more selections. Other than that taste wise we think it's mediocre, not impressionable.
4
Needed an Italian restaurant for a Saturday which is surpisingly difficult in Singapore. Ended up at Per Bacco. Overall I liked the place. the wine list was reasonable and the food not too expensive by Singapore standards (and they offered lunch specials).
3
Came here for lunch today and ordered the set lunch consisting of broccoli soup, some sausages and some passion fruit icecream. Food was fairly average. Service was good. Not very many people in the restaurant.
1
Ordered the full portion lobster but barely see ANY meat in it . not worth the amount paid. Told the staff about my feedback to get a stern facial expression from her , without even apologizing.
5
Very good food. Only thing that I feel can improve a little is the timing of the main course which should be all served together. There's a significant gap between some main courses.
3
Had lunch with a number of business acquaintances. Had the set lunch which was pretty good value. Service was quick and efficient. The soup was passable but I found the salmon a little dry.
5
the food was great, service was good and we even received a complimentary cake for the celebration. thank you!
5
My Friend brought me to this wonderful restaurant, she likes it so much and now I turn into a big fan of it too. The food is very delicious, the pasta is the best one I ever had, very tasty, and the cold cut is very perfect especially when you have it with the cheese, the wine is also great, and the waitress is really helpful and nice, you can always ask for recommendations from her and will never get disappointed . Definitely will come back again, I missed it so much.
3
$6 prosecco is great and tasted awesome. The menu has the option to order "half portion" but when you order half portion to save space for dessert, the waitress will tell you the half portion is very very small. We went ahead anyway with small portion and it was perfect size actually. The next table got the same comment. Dessert was not too bad, tiramisu and lava cake. Tiramisu could be better though if you want to offer authentic italian food
4
The place was empty when we came . Service is good , as we were the only table . Initially quite skeptical over the food, ordered pasta and pizza. Food came quick and food above average . Value wise , more expensive than usual Italian . Come try here for a quiet night out , food is fresh and service is good .
3
I had beef tagliatelle pasta (modified version of beef lasagna) and my friend had spaghetti vangole. The tagliatelle wasn't al dente, was very soft. My friend comment vangole not as savoury as it should be. Flipped side, service was awesome. In a nutshell, with the price, food and service. I MIGHT visit but won't recommend
3
The dining experience has hits and misses. The burrata serving with arugula and vine tomatoes drizzled with balsamico is a winner. The Chardonnay was not bad. The nutella pannacotta and fig gelato were both creative. IN addition, the exceptional service by a Malay waitstaff must be commended!. Unfortunately, was not too happy with the gnocchi, and a Chinese waitstaff who seems too bothered to serve
5
I love how homely and cozy this resto feels the moment I stepped inside, with one side of the wall in exposed bricks. The tables are nicely placed and spaced out so that patrons do not feel like the next table may eavesdropped in a private conversation. This visit, we tried the Degustation Menu, which is a steal at $68! For antipasti, it was burrata cheese with rocket leaves and marinated cherry tomatoes. Primo piatti was an excellent home made pasta with crab meat and pesto sauce. And for our secondo piatti, we had nicely grilled lamb loins with braised shallots and marsala juice. Dessert was excellent pannacotta with caramelised hazelnut. The prosecco was one of the best that I've tasted: Areo Ruggeri extra dry prosecco. The red Domenico Clerico Barolo was just okay. I think we should have ordered the Cesare Amarone (can't go very wrong with Amarones!!)The staff was very friendly, ever with smiles and towards the end of our dinner, Chef Marco was so kind and charming to come and greet his patrons. I would highly recommend this place if you want to impress a date and yet do not want to go overboard with the spending
5
I held several parties here for various occasions. Food is always excellent and the ambience is lovely. If you are looking for some authentic Italian food, this is definitely the place to try. They can cater the menu according to your budget and needs. It's a great place for friends and family gathering as well as business lunches
5
Was immensely impressed by the quality of food, especially when we were a group of more than 10. Even though most of us had ordered their signature beef dish, the kitchen team managed to cook all to perfection according to individual preferences.The owner and Chef Marco made time to chat with us which was a nice personal touch.Thank you
5
Threw a send-off party for my son last night. Everyone at Perbacco was most accommodating, from the incredibly talented Chef Marco, who diligently worked out a specialized menu after several email exchanges, to the very charming restaurant owner Soon Kai, who not only took care to give us a private corner, he somehow magically appeared whenever we needed something and readily acceded to our every request. Plus he was plenty entertaining! The serving staff worked hard all nite to cater to my party of 14. Thanks!As for the food, it was nothing short of spectacular. The starter, pasta with crab meat in pesto sauce was heavenly; moist and flavorful and left one wanting more. If it was a percusor of better things to come, we were not disappointed. There were 2 choices of main courses, beef tenderloin wrapped in parma ham or baked red snapper fillet. Both were excellent (I tasted both) and cooked to perfection. The beef tenderloin melts like butter in one's mouth and I could see my guests nodding in approval. The snapper was cooked just right, sweet and firm with a delightful accompanying sauce. Dessert, a generous serving of tiramisu served well to end the evening on a perfect note. Best restaurant ever, great food, service, ambience and wine selection. The best part is that it doesn't put a big dent on your wallet
5
I always come here when I want to get good Italian fare with impeccable service. I visited Perbacco again on June 24th with a friend from out of town. Our orders to say the least are unique and some deviate from the menu. Instead of turning us down, they went ahead and executed our orders without any fanfare and it was delicious. The quality was consistent and I love it
5
Was at PerBacco for lunch for the first time. Very spacious cafe-like setting although the frontage and the bar somewhat conceal the big space at the back. Food was great. Had panna cotta for desert, one of the best I ever tasted. Also enjoyed an excellent glass of Italian wine, Amarone, which was served as a house pour!
5
We recently visited Singapore and our family were looking for a change from local cuisine and came across PerBacco restaurant. The ambience was fantastic and the food was the best italian food we have ever eaten. Our fussy youngest daughter was catered for without hesitation from the staff. Our waitress Pauline was extremely tentative to all our needs and even chef Marco came to our table to chat with us. The menu was extremely extensive and our food did not disappoint. The only issue was what to order. The melt in your mouth sorbet was a delightful end to our meal. We would definitely be back to this amazing restaurant
5
we were there for a farewell party with a whole bunch of us lady colleagues so the restaurant was very thoughtful to give us the sofa seats as well as complimentary tiramisu for our special one. we were also there for the HSBC 1 for 1 deal and the main courses were all SO GOOD. especially the lamb! amazing. the wine was really value for money too. we will definitely go back there for other events when opportunity permits
4
Food was great with reasonable servings. However, the restaurant was too noisy to allow for a peaceful conversation
4
Great Appetizer. Could be better with the mains. Great atmosphere. Might consider coming back to try out other appetizers.
4
Restaurant was spacious and very good for gathering with friends to chat over drinks and food. Service staff were very professional and polite. Food was good, although the time taken for the food to be served felt longer than expected.
4
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food here. Squid ink pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and complemented well by a fragrant crabmeat sauce. Lamb was also cooked very well! I'd recommend this place if you want to try some Italian food.
5
Friendly service staff, comfortable atmosphere that not really want to leave my chair. Food was superb which we get some introducing from Chef Albert to make our table a very nice dinner!!!
3
The food was decent, but I didnt have the same experience as some of the other reviewers in that sense. Service was good, servers were pretty good. Atmosphere was good too. But the pricing was far above par for this place in my view.
3
We stayed for 20 mins. The food coming out from the kitchen looked incredible however, we waited 10 mins for someone to greet us only to ask in a hasty tone, 'would you like to order your dinner?" We wanted to order wine, they had a very nice list, but we were looking for a suggestion from the sommelier. After also realizing that we were going to listen to the entire Phil Collin's Greatest Hits album, it was clear we were going to wait for less than average service and for a birthday dinner, I thought my boyfriend deserved better
5
On a public holiday, this place is too quiet than it deserves!Friendly and attentive service crew gave us great recommendations! We arrived about 6pm, just in time for their happy hour, 1 for 1 cocktails and 3 for the price of 2 tapas.Restaurant was spacious, comfortable tables and a relaxing environment.Food was great and reasonably priced! Generous with their bread basket too.Will return with friends
5
Fantastic and reasonably priced food and wine in central. Not too crowded nor noisy. Great for dates. The only glitch was not being able to enjoy 1 for 1 cocktails at the restaurant area but only at the bar side. Strange workings. Hope they sort this ou
4
We went for dinner on a Friday evening. It was one of the most relaxing evenings I had in quite a while over some really good food. The general ambiance of the restaurant is also very nice, it is quiet and spacious with tables not placed right next to each other. I would definitely go back here again
4
the waiter and waitress are very attentive. The place is spacious and peaceful. A good place to chill with friends.
5
Very nice atmosphere and excellent service by staff and manager.. very nice food and wine.. highly recommended..
3
Atmosphere was quiet and private for a Friday night. Service is really friendly although not always prompt. Food is authentically Italian and satisfying enough.
4
Cool and relaxed vibe, great service and decent tapas make this place a good option to kick off your night out in Singapore.
4
Can really recommend it ,perfect dinner , for the price food was good , we will be back, very good service!
3
we went there for the truffle honey which was not available. :( hopefully they keep them on stock all the time.
5
I was there with 5 friends. Meat lovers and vegetarians. Enough choice for both.
The food was very good. Sauce with my lamb chops...delicious!
Nice restaurant to sit. Good ambiance. Waiters were professional.
4
Good food and service. One of my favourite Italian joint definitely. If you are dining in, ask for the dining hall when making reservation. Otherwise, you could hangout at their bar area for pre-dinner drinks and snacks. My favourite dishes are fried calamari (from their bar-drink menu but you could request for it), antipasti - cured cold cuts, risotto and do ask for their daily specials. They also offer a good selection of wine at very reasonable prices. Their friendly manager is more than happy to throw in some valuable pointers depending on your unique preference of wine
2
Its summed up by the contrast between the washroom and the rest of the premises. Proprietor ran out of funds to complete the vision for the restaurant after doing up the bath.The lobster linguine, broth used for the sauce tasted pre-mix.Risotto with parma ham and scarmoza cheese, lacked character (perhaps should have used smoked scarmoza) and for some reason the rice was too puffed.Could not fault the Parmigiani though, probably the highlight of the meal
5
In terms of price quality so far the best in 2.5 years in Singapore. Strange that it was so quiet, but good service and the all of the food really had a good taste. Carpaccio with a nice taste and also the pasta bolognaise for the little one was perfect.Whole lobster for approx.$36 is a bargain, cooked to perfection
4
Good sized portions and a nice variety of food. Between our table of 3 we had seabass, lamb and a pasta dish. Everyone liked the food, and there was room for dessert. Recommend the profiteroles and the bottled italian craft beer.
5
Headed here after a business meeting with colleagues. Great service, wine and food! The tortellini special was divine! The desserts were made properly especially the tiramisu!
5
The food was excellent and served by well trained staff who were attentive and could offered good suggestions. The restaurant had the state of the art kitchen and refrigerator. Good value for money.
5
Awesome ambiance and attentive staff matched by tasty and interesting food. We ordered the set lunch which was good money for its value.
4
We had a good experience in this restaurant. We ordered the Cold Cut Platter for three and the Octopus for our non meat friend. Cold Cuts were better at other places but octopus was great. Our Tenderloin and Sirloin were perfectly grilled. I had a beautiful cod fish and our friend had an amazing Turbot. Tiramisu was also better than any other restaurants, Pannacotta and Profiteroles worth a try. An Italian Pinot Noir and brut Sparkling Wines accompanied our dinner. Our server lady was very polite and helpful as well as the bus boy. The only thing that turned us off is when one of the employee told us that the restaurant is closed at 11:30pm in a unbelievably impolite way. He did not come to our table, he practically just spoke louder from the middle of the dining place and gave us an ugly look. We have enjoyed our time so much and we got carried away with the time, all you could do was just to remind us nicely or politely that we have passed your closing hour and we would be fully alert and apologized for our over joyful moments at your place! Instead now you ruined our moments by your impoliteness and ugly gesture by shooing us away and even glanced again to give us dirty look when you walked away. I work for Hospitality Industry as well, I know how to treat my guests better! Your management need to train this particular male staffs better with Ethics 101!
3
I had the Fois Gras starter followed by the Lobster pasta whilst my wife had the eggplant starter and turbot main. We also shared a salad. The food was excellent but what let the whole place down was the service. We visited on a saturday night at around 8pm. The restaurant was about half full. First disappointment was that a couple of the specials were not available. For early in the evening and when the restaurant is only half full suggests poor planning. Service was generally slow and the staff seemed to be fussing around without really doing much. We had to chase our drinks order three times. Our food was brought in the wrong order with the salad which we had asked to be served with our main course being brought before our starters. When we came to pay we also found that we had been charged for drinks which we had to change due to them running out of what we had ordered.Both the food and drinks menu are reasonably priced. $12 for a glass of prosecco I thought was very reasonable and as I mentioned the food was of good quality and well presented.Generally a nice restaurant which I would have rated much higher if the service had matched the food qualit
5
Perbacco is an exciting Italian restaurant located next to the popular tapas place Binomio on Craig Road. The restaurant has two sections, allowing you to choose between casual bistro style dining in the front, or formal dining further inside. The owners are obviously food and wine lovers themselves and the selection of house wines we were offered at dinner were nothing short of extraordinary. The Barolo was full-bodied and went beautifully with the mix-grill. We had some excellent starters, including an egg-yolk ravioli that was to die for. At the end of the day, what sets this place apart for me was the variety and quality of house wines offered. If the owners keep this up, I will most certainly be coming back
5
I'm a Singaporean and we are known for our love of food. I would say without hesitation that this is THE best Italian restaurant here in SG for the moment. If they keep up the standard of the food and service, it won't be long before we will have to be wait listed to get a table! House pours of Barolo and Pinot Noir of excellent value and quality! Starters both cold ( Alaskan King Crab and hams) and hot ( croquettes) were delicious, freshly prepared and cut! Our 3 egg yolk raviolis were amazing, oozing out as we cut and tasted exquisite! Main course of mix grill was tender and flavourful! Presentation was no less creative than most gastronomic tables in SG! My second time there and was not disappointed! Highly recommend this restaurant if you must have Italian, and even if you don't, they have a beautiful bar which i love, dark stained wood and little hooks for ladies' handbags! Good value for money too!
4
This was a pleasant surprise. The food was delicious and full of authentic and original flavors. I would go there again just for the food! The service was definitely above average although we sat in a cozy corner where it was a bit difficult to gain the attention of the service staff. On the other hand the chef came around and spoke to all the guest. He even took the time to explain his recipe and preparation of some of the dishes that we really loved. A must try if you are in Singapore
1
the booking by the website tripadvisor was not taken into consideration by the restaurant. So we were placed in the bar area and not in the restaurant part . In the midst of people who are there for a drink . And the desserts had no taste....bad global experience
5
Good ambience, good food. Attentive
service staff. Separate drinks and dinner sections. Convenient location.
Ample parking too. Great for friends catch up.
5
great italian cuisine - the chef is also from italy and he delivers a best in class food, atmosphere and price for value. 5 of 5 - no doubts and highly recommended!
3
The ambience was lovely, food tasty although the pairing of flavours was strange in parts, but service terrible- 25 mins from arriving to take a drink order.. And the lack of attention continued from there. Expected more following reviews!
5
Everything about PerBacco is just brilliant! The service, the people and especially the food! I'm a regular visitor, at least once a week, and have to say the best value restaurant in Singapore.
5
Excellent Italian wine list! Great food and atmosphere.Trendy upbeat decor. Check out the ceiling made of wine boxes.
5
The ambiance was fantastic. The food was excellent. My wagyu beef starter melts in your mouth. The pork collar was tender and juicy. Yummy. And the best part was the staff and chef. When they heard that my wife and I were there for our wedding anniversary, they gave us a special complimentary dessert. That was an unexpectedly beautiful gesture. Thanks Perbacco
5
Going out for dinner this is a great place in Singapore to choose. Portions are rather large so we unfortunately ended up with no room for dessert - bummer! The seafood there is extremely fresh and just flown in, it felt like it had just been caught. The Chef will circle the tables and chat for a bit answering all our food questions. The atmosphere there is also very nice suitable for romatic dinners, business or a group of friends, would not recommend taking younger children. One of the few places in Singapre with true value for money especailly compared to the freshness and quality of the food. A great Italian dinner and really liked the fact that it is not your typical Italian dishes (which is not a bad thing for me), but one has the possibility to try numerous great dishes.
5
We went to PerBacco for our 36th wedding anniversary with very close friends! What a great night.The ambience and decor are very nice, warm, cosy and welcoming from the beginning. Service was good at all times...very friendly and efficient.For starters we shared ravioli, beef carpaccio and eggplant parmigiana. All were very nice, well presented and tasty. For mains we had the Dover sole, brisket, cod fish and lamb chops. Again all were very good, cooked to perfection. For closing we had all 5 desserts on the menu and shared...what the hell, a 36th anniversary only happens once, right! The desserts were heavenly!Chef Marco came to introduce himself...a nice touch! Pricing is reasonable, not cheap but not too expensive. All round a great evening with public parking right next to the restaurant! We were almost the last to leave and will definitely be back!!!
4
Loved the food and drinks. Quality is top notch and pricing compared to similar restaurants is on the lower side. We had a vegetarian in our party and very limited choices for her made her not enjoy the experience as much. Portion size for both appetizer and mains is on the smaller side.
4
Came here due to the #1 rating on tripadvisor. They have starter, 2nd course, main and dessert sections and you are free to choose how many. There's also degustation from $58 to $90, it seems pretty flexibleTo start, i had the angel hair with fish roe. It was good, albeit a little to overcooked or wet. My friends enjoyed the squid . For mains, my beef brisket is tough and charred in parts. My friend's lamb was very goodDesset came in small portions. My profiteroles were ok. My friend's tiramisu was also smallFood overall 3 stars. The good service increased to 4. The staff were smiling, helpful. When the bottle of red i wanted was not available, they offered another with 10% of
5
Excellent and attentive staff, great ambience with romantic lighting, delicious food. Loved the gnocchi and the risotto, and the tiramisu was great as well. We'll be back!
5
I am Italian and This is one of the best Italian restaurant I have ever been worldwide. Great food and wine selection. Marco, the chef and his staff are very welcoming and professional. Great job and thanks for taking care of me. Mauro
5
I've been there twice and everything was just great!
Food is delicious and good value. Chef's bruschetta and piadina are to die for.
He's friendly and a great entertainer. Service was very good.
Highly recommended!
5
the food and the atmosphere was completed amazing!
Enjoyed the experience and for sure recommend this restaurant, in my opinion the best one of Singapore!#Don`t miss!
5
the food was outstanding and the overall atmosphere was great! Service could be better because they seemed to be short staffed
5
We had dinner at PerBacco and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience: excellent quality ingredients delicately put together and a wine list offering good choices at several price levels.
Ambience modent but at the same time traditional. We will go back.
5
Arrival - greeting pleasant and given our choice of table. 7pm still quiet.Ambience - well set out. Bar and restaurant split. Both very well presented and clean. Felt good.Table service - very good and attentive. Not over bearing but knew his stuff and was always ready when needed. Ordering - gave us some tips. Not the most expensive and which turned out to be on the button.Starter - tuna tartare. Really good. A little bit more spice/chilli would have improved but that is being picky.Mains - lamb. Very tender and well cooked. Just the right amount red. Again very good.Desert - Tiramisu . To die for . Best ever.Drinks - Prosecco and beers $9 per glass. Cheap for Singapore.Coffee - good quality and reasonably priced.Overall - the best quality for money meal that I remember in Singapore. We eat out most days and will return here as long as they keep up this standard. $167 for shared starter, 2 mains, shared desert, 2 coffees and 6 drinks - fantastic. Well done all
5
Our first introduction to Perbacco was over dinner with some good friends. We tried Bruschetta, Foagra, Affogato and Creme Brule. Since then, My wife and I have been a frequent visitor. As of July 22nd we had Crab Croquets, Charcoal Grilled Octopus, Cured Wagyu Beef, Seafood Pasta and Tiramisu. All the food comes on time-that’s a big plus. The wine were good and the staff(Colleen and Abdullah) are friendly. Overall I’ll give the highest rating. Not only foods are delicious and timely, Marco-the Chef/Owner went out and greet us as well. My wife and I will definitely come again
4
Really cosy and private environment. Food was very good - fresh and authentic. Its menu is small but that's the way it should be if you know your food is great. The chef regularly came out to check if we're ok and that was really nice - intimate and personal. I'd definitely go back again
5
This is my 2nd time back in PerBacco. The first time, while the food was gorgeous, there was some teething issues and I'm glad this time round, the food came out in timely manner. I had the prawn for starter, soup for middle course, lamb loin for main and profiterole for dessert. The soup was alright. The starter, lamb loin were OUTSTANDING. I was never the biggest fan of lamb and my experience at PerBacco, I had the lamb rack which was memorable and this time round, they changed the menu and I had the lamb loin. Equally amazing.The price was very reasonable. It's very rare to find a nice restaurant that has steak under $40. My partner and I had a beer each, a bottle of wine between both of us, 2 starters, 2 middle courses, 2 main and 1 dessert and all come to only $270. Chef Marco was extremely friendly and even offered us 4 shots of limoncello on the house. The restaurant has good space too without being cramped too near to other table. Perfect for date night. Definitely going back again
5
The best Italian in Singapore, wonderful cocktails, fantastic wine list. great value, professional service, and beautiful food
5
Was there for dinner a couple of times and each time had left the restaurant feeling extremely satisfied. Great ambience (non-pretentious), prompt service and excellent food! Will go back again!

New set up from Chef Marco Violano (formerly from Otto Locanda) - great Italian food cooked with passion and extensive italian wine selection.
Great service - you will like it!

I found Perbacco on internet, as we wanted to have an authentic italian food experience.We couldn't have chosen better. The staff is friendly and welcoming and they truly help you chosing what to have. I can recommend the Sardinian fregola with lobster for fish lovers and the mixed grilled meat for those who would rather have meat. The chef in this place seems to put a lot of love into the food he prepares and has recipes for all palates. Big choice of cocktails and wines as well. Excellent value for money!

Excellent food, and very tasty cocktails. Those cocktails were his original, using a lot of fresh fruits. Also the waiter and waitress were nice, not too much interaction but friendly explaining about the food they serve. Cheese platter was amazing as well. Especially the truffle honey dip was super good. Must try.If they have explanations of the menu in English, or have some pictures on the menu, that will be very helpful because we had a bit hard time to have a picture what they are.

Went there with a group of friends, the warm service and generous servings amazed me. Dishes there are exceptional where you can really taste the high quality ingredients making the prices really valued for money. Went back again with my client and she was really impressed. Must try squid ink pasta, meat platter and end off with gelato and a Lemonchell

From the extensive wine list to the impecable food, Perbacco is fast becoming my go to Italian restaurant. The food is always superb and Chef Marco Violana is very passionate about cooking and it translates wonderfully in his food. Each dish on the menu is carefully prepared with love and offers a unique take on a southern italian meal.Some of my favourites include the Eggplant Parmagiana, Foie Gras Terrine, Squid Ink Spaghetti, Grill Lamb and Braised Veal Cheek. Chef Marco also prepares an excellent degustation menu, with thoughtful consideration to any special dietery request that you may have.Save room for dessert,my all time favourite is the chestnut creme brulee. It's so delicious! Instead of the usual rich custard, this unique dessert is made of chestnut.It is the only creme brulee I love!The tiramisu is as equally delicious. Not only does Chef Marco serve up a unique take on a home cooked italian meal, he is quite the entertainer and often comes out of the kitchen to mingle with guests. Perbecco gets 2 thumbs up from me! It's where I would go on an intimate date or for a gathering amongst friends

The food scene in Singapore doesnt need another italian restuarant and yet i keep coming back to PerBacco for more.The bar area serves as the perfect pre dinner drinks area especially with the tempting array of wines, beer and aperitivo on display. Paired with the delectable cheese n cold cuts, the curated selection of finger food served in a cosy friendly environment makes one think of a breezy european evening in a charming neighbourhood. Dont even get me started on the main meal, esp love the meats n pasta. Chef Marco extremely charismatic, making us feel as if he invited us to his home and we dine in what would have been his living room in puglia with what feels like he would serve for his close friends. Rustic flavours and generous servings yet presented in an elegant way makes the the dishes such value for money.Must try include the beef carpaccio, pasta with uni and scallop, kobe beef, creme brulee, tirimisu and pistachio gelato. Lemonchello to end off the meal makes for a perfect dining experience

PerBacco is definitely my favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore! There is something to be said for a restaurant who's headed by a chef in this business for more than a decade. Great menu, wine selection and excellent, attentive service, which is rare in this city! A new favourite go-to spot for a cozy dinner or for when I have friends in town

We had a fantastic meal for my girlfriend 's birthday for a group of 16. It was so refreshing to have the warm Italian hospitality and friendly service. The food was superb too and was specially prepared for the group. Excellent wine list too! We would highly recommend PerBacco for a group event or a quiet dinner. I will be taking my clients there in the near future to try the lunch
