We ordered several items and the food was alright, not that great. Some of our food included pig intestine, abalone, Lor Mee, and roasted chicken. Interestingly, the restaurant charged us for the regular disposable wet napkins, but I guess it's their customary items.

First time trying Hokkien food and happy to say I was not disappointed. The food was great and unique in everyway. Particularly loved the fried trotters, Hokkien style congee, and the duck wrapped in taro. The Chinese tea (guanyin) was superb. Definitely would dine again.

Imagine paying SGD19+ (before 10%tax + 7% GST) for mee hoon soup? The plate of pig intestines was also expensive for the few pieces served. Food was okay but the prices are like hotel prices now.

Overly salted food. Suspect they own an MSG factory! Staff also not very interested; spend too much time shouting to one another.

I was there for dinner with my daughter in law and 15 months’ old grandson. The restaurant served my grandson a complimentary meal served in a very attractive car shaped plate.They have a new dish- mee sua in gravy. Very yummy and portion is good for me. Value for money.Next is the yam paste dessert, it’s smooth and not utterly sweet, so it doesn’t make me feel guilty ordering them. Lastly of course their signature dish - the very fine fine bee hoon stir fry that you cannot do without!Sorry I didn’t take any photos cos was busy feeding my grandson and my DIL enjoying her meal I will be back again with photos soon... I will eat again before leaving SG.

I was there for dinner with my daughter in law and grandson. They served my grandson a complimentary meal in a very brightly yellow coloured car shaped plate . Their signature dish - the stir fry bee hoon (so so fine) is the best. There’s also another new dish - smaller version of the soupy mee sua. Appropriate portion for me. Then comes the best dessert - yam paste. Not overly sweet or oily. Well blended and full of yam taste.

Went to the Marina Square outlet. Ordered a set for 6 and a side order of cockles. For those who love cockles, must definitely order. Fresh cockles dipped in Chilli, garlic and soya sauce. Builds up the appetite. The 3 appetisers and the main dishes were are nicely done. Not too salty. Kids love the lychee pork, while the adults like the steam fish. Service is excellent as staff are attentive.

Food - Yam (think glazed with honey), soup, and Bee Hoon is really nice. Staff recommended their fried trotters but it's really not nice and lost my appetite after tasting the fried trotter. Plenty of other dishes to order thus need not really go for what they recommend.Service - Do not expect too much. Other then being efficient in serving food, our requests to clear and set plates were ignored even after 5th reminder, eventually I stood up to collect plates from the side station. Don't think I will be back to this outlet

Mixed bag. The food was good, but the service confusing. Did they mean to ignore us or were they disorganized? Was it that we were Caucasian? Not unfriendly, just not very helpful or friendly. Lots of choices so I'd recommend somewhere else. We did like the food, but not the hidden costs, towel??? water???? unasked for appetizer!!!!

Pu Tien is a fujianese restaurant. They have several branches in the city. Also in jakarta. Their specility is the fujian noodle, sweet sour pork with lychees, fried taro and steam fish.

Love the food. Portion served are big even ordered medium sieving.Staffs are friendly too. First time to this outlet and never disappoint. Keep it up and well done.

A very different from the usual Chinese restaurant. Love the varieties and price is affordable. Food are served hot BUT took too long to be served. Staff are friendly and keep helping to check my order. Will return again with family

If you crave simple good food that taste like what your grandmother used to cook, here is the place.You get hearty food to satisfy you and keep your full.I do not think the food is very fanciful, but it all taste pretty good even to my picky parents

A frequent patrons for Marina Square Putien. Love the service and food quality there. Been to Ion brand but food are not that tasty - is like the chef rushing to cook and some of our food are burnt. Staff apologize and put in our order again. Sitting also weird in Ion especially near the walkway leaving to the private room. We still love to dine in Marina Square branch

Went to the Vivo city branch order set lunch meal for 2.When we arrived, they give us 2 appetiser which is Chinese pickles and seaweed peanut. We did not asked for it and we think its free. When we received the bill, we get charged $3 for seaweed peanut.The food is actually nice but the hidden charge is unfair and we can not argue as we ate them.They also charge for wet towel. Won't recommend and won't be back agai

Went to ION branch, had an good but average meal at pu thien restaurant. Never been there before, wont go again. Just checked my bi adding 1 sgd for towel which i didnt even open and 3 sgd for some seaweed nuts given to me to wait for the lon coming food. Never asked for it neither did i even tried it.

Their specialty braised beancurd with chinese cabbage soup, fried Heng Hwa beehoon, Putien Lor Mee and bamboo herbal prawns were just nice in taste & presentation. Simple, homely and does not leave you feeling too full. I love their springy textured beancurd and home made tangy chilli sauce (pairs well with everything).Service was lacking although the restaurant was not running full capacity. Overall an OK place to dine in during off peak hours

Was told the cockles here are great but unfortunately they were sold out when we arrived at 7.30pm so we ordered the clams instead. Our appetizer was braised pigs' intestines pretty chewy followed by the clams which were garnished with lots of chopped garlic and steamed. A bit overcooked though.Next came the deep fried buns with sweet lean pork which are so good we ordered another serving. Definitely recommended especially for those who love 'kong bak pau'.Their lor mee is a bit strange and soggy which am not a fan at all.Very surprised that they have the delicate Taro dessert which is my all-time favourite. Not huge but a bit heavy, thick and slightly sweet which is just perfect. Will be back

Had lunch here for the 1st time. Went for the set lunch for 6 pax with cost $188++. The taste of the dishes are just nice and does not leave you feeling too full and greasy. The pork rib is nice so are the lor mee and steam food
4
Portion of the food was just nice and the ambience was bustling with the busy dinner crowd.
Food was served promptly but staff needs to pay a little bit more attention to details and when requested for assistance.
Pricing of the food was okay.
4
Must try - Loh Mee, Fried Bee Hoon, Spinach with Assorted Eggs, Sweet and Sour Pork. These dishes cooked just right. This place is often full house, better to make reservations.
4
Pu Tien offer different way of serving Chinese Cuisine. The presentation is good and the cooking is excellent. Make sure you have reservation as the restaurant was fully reserved when I arrived before 18.00. Good service also even the waitress are young. They are well trained.

Having been to the Marina Square "Pu Tien" Restaurant (not Putin, though I'm sure Vladimir would like it!) some time ago, I decided to try the Raffles City one this time and I was not disappointed, much to the contrary! The restaurant is quite recent, a quite big, modern Chinese, well designed place. Service is excellent and masters English rather well. Just be careful with their business hours: my first attempt was unsuccessful around 13:45 for lunch; I was turned away. Now at 13:15 no problem, but I noted that by 14;15 the place was practically empty. The lunch clientele seemed to be mainly local business people; I was the only Ang Moh.The food is excellent and comes in reasonably big servings. I could not finish the braised bamboo shoots, shrimp roll (S) and sweet-sour pork with lychee (S) I had ordered. Fortunately the charming maitre had advised me just to order 'small' portions. My bill turned out to be less than 45 Sin$, no complaints! Their menu - Fujian cooking - is very complete and leaves nothing to be desired

For me, I think Pu Tien has managed to live up to their slogan "Tasty, Simple & Heart-Warming Comfort Food" pretty well.As this restaurant serves dishes from Putian, a coastal suburb in Fujian, what diners can get here is quite different and unique from other Chinese restaurants in Singapore.This branch in Marina Square is cosy with nice ambience and efficient staff. Our order was taken promptly and more importantly, we did not have to wait very long for it to be served. The food is good and serving is adequate. Do try their signature dish "Deep Fried Squirrel Fish" (S$38++) which is essentially sea bass deep fried to crispy perfection and shaped to look like a squirrel. Other worthy dishes to try include Stir Fried Yam (S$18.90 for Medium serving), Homemade Beancurd (S$14.90 Medium), Water Snowflake Vegetable (S$18.90 Medium), Sweet Sour Pork (S$12.90 Small). I would not recommend the Deep Fried Whole Chicken as it tasted a bit dry. If you're into Oyster Omelette, Pu Tien's version is quite a delight. Don't miss their SourSop Juice as well (S$18 a jug). Their fried noodles is a best-seller too.If you intend to dine there in a big group, do call to make a reservation (tel: 6336 4068) a few days ahead as there appear to be only 3 bigger round tables to sit up to 12 people

As the menu says, they serve fujian food. Fuji is said to be a lush island in China with unusual climate. In any case, the food here is excellent. We remembered this place from a previous trip five years ago and the memory of a great tofu dish. We were lucking to find it and pleased that the food was as good as we remembered it. The tofu (beancurd) was some of the best we have ever tried. As appetizer mini-shrimp with seaweed, and braised bamboo shoot. They were both very good. The gentleman serving us was friendly and helpful, guiding us to not order too much food. He was right, of course.At the time we were there, it was not very crowded, so the pace was relaxing and the place very peaceful

we went to the parkway parade outlet.. queue was orderly. staff polite.for a family of 5 adults we ordered1)Spinach cooked with eggs2)fried egg plant3)Tenggiri fish4) Shredded Meat with Bun5) Pu Tien Lor meall were very delicious.we will definitely go bac

This is a very popular Hokkien or Heng hwa Restuarant that server traditional MEE Sua. It is one of my perfect place to bring my extended family for dinner. The quality of cooking is consistent ( at least in marine parade which we usually patronize). The few favorite of the family are :Sweet and sour pork with lycheeDrunken prawns served in bamboo containerLoh MEEThe fried MEE Sua with clamsFried bun with sliced porkSliced bitter ground dipped in honey ( appetizer)Chilli that is free flow- family's favourite. If the bowl is full when we seated, it definitely need to be refilled or emptied before we finished the meal. We tried the fish soup for the first time and it is delicious as we love oriental soup.I always look forward to their special menu of the season. This month was bamboo clams. Go early and or book in advance. It is also long queue on weekend.. I would rate that 9/10 for most of the dishes.

A friend brought me here and I thought it was a littlw pricey but the food was tasty and very filling. The lor mee was delicious was their signature yam dish. Only thing to avoid is the pork with buns. The buns are deep fried and hard.Other than that we had a very enjoyable meal

Had a family dinner at the outlet at Marina Square. We had visited other outlets and liked the food. This restaurant is rather small and they have quite a few booth seats that would accommodate 4 adults but I've seen some booth seated 6 adults. We arrived after shopping at Marina Square and made our reservations then for dinner an hour later.The food is good just like the other outlets and the portion is rather big. We had 3 adults and one child. We ordered 3 noodles, 3 side dishes and 3 other dishes. This is not your typical China Chinese cooking where it is oily and spicy. The taste are more soothing and mild.. if you will.The waitress is knowledgable and make recommendations based on what you have ordered. You can see photos of some of the dishes we ordered. The bill came up to $130+ and that included one fish dish that cost $20.I would visit this restaurant chain again for sure.
