Summer Pavilion has been a favourite amongst family and friends for years now - happy to claim it as the best Cantonese restaurant in Singapore. Great service, top quality ingredients and nice ambience - must go in Singapore!
4
Seems to have improved from my past dining experience. Lobster Yu-sheng, Steam Soon Hock, steam chicken, suckling piglet was well done.
5
It is an excellent experience. Highly recommend sweet and sour pork! Try the appetiser whitebait fish, one of the best!
4
Here with colleagues for dinner. Attentive and kind service, delightful ambience. Food was delicious, had mostly non-seafood to stay within budget...
5
I will definite come again! Environment and food are legit ! The best ever meals I have had :D It’s a very nice place for families and friends even couples.
5
Best Chinese restaurant in Singapore!!! Even better than Hong Kong lung king Heen. Smoked duck and cha siu 😋😋😋 very professional setting and service :)
5
Food is very good. We ordered dim sum. My favorite is abalone tarts and their soup are very tasty. Should try their tea.
5
Fantastic Dinner Menus, Fantastic Service, Greeting, all Perfect, even I came there solo. Will going to go there soon.
5
The food is fabulous, the ambience befitting of a Ritz Carlton, but best of all is the service. Coco sends me customised menus, takes reservations at all times of the day and night, and generally ensures we always have a good time. Great with kids, with friends, for meetings, or simply for an indulgent lunch. Sharon takes the best photos and is always game for a song! Highly recommend Summer Pavilion

Have been to Summer Pavilion on several occasions and the restaurant never fails to deliver. Food is always skilfully prepared, fresh and delicious. Service is attentive and thoughtful. Salt and Pepper duck is amazingly tender and goes well with a red wine. Soups are light yet very flavourful. Bamboo clams here are the best I've eaten. Too many nice dishes to list them all there. Ambience is classy without being stuffy
4
The restaurant is beautiful and the waiters were very polite and attentive, but I felt the food was overpriced and not as amazing as I had expected for a Michelin-starred restaurant.
5
As soon as we arrived we were welcome by large smiles and a splendid table with beautiful tableware. Food was very delicate and so good. Barbecued meat was fantastic.
5
The service was impeccable - paying attention to the finer details. The dishes tasted as good as they were presented.
5
Was there for dinner, the food was good. My favorite picks would be the scallop with eggplant, fish bone/fish maw soup and the poached lobster rice. Service staff were amazing and extremely attentive to details. We were very impressed. Nice ambience and we didn't have too wait long for food. Overall it was a great first experience. Will def be back
5
We booked a private dinner for five adults and a baby. I worked out the custom menu upfront with the staff and the night was absolutely flawless. Food and service were outstanding. We had the duck, birds-nest soup, abalone, fish noodles, amazing desserts. The pace was great, the ambience wonderful. There is a S$1,000 food minimum for the private room, it was definitely worthwhile to have a private experience. Staff was super attentive and friendly, The Ritz Carlton type of service shines through at this restaurant as well
5
Excellent service provided by staff. Food was exceptionally good. Ordered herbal soup, roasted tea leaf duck, bamboo clam, vegetable and noodles. All tasted great! Kudos to the manager Gary who was meticulous and made the birthday dinner a special occasion for us. Well done summer pavilion.

First time going to a restaurant that offered desserts menu when im still eating my lobster fish noodles. The whole meal was rushed and we didn't enjoy i
5
Finding the perfect location for a Golden Wedding anniversary for the whole family was not an easy task, but luckily we found the Summer Pavilion.The private room we had was decorated with great taste and beautiful pictures on the wall.The service was perfect with the main waiter Kenny doing an excellent job. The food was delicious, innovative and very well presented. The size of the portions was just the right amount. All in all an unforgettable experience
5
I came here with my mum for dinner one evening during our holiday vacation stay at the Ritz-Carton Millenia Singapore. The decor and overall atmosphere of the restaurant was comfortable and relaxed. The staff were extremely helpful with dish recommendations. Great Cantonese food and 10/10 service
5
Definitely a great place to host your guests. First dinner of Year 2018, a great way to starts. Summer Pavilion a Michelin ⭐️ restaurant serve exquisite & nice Chinese cuisine. Each dish were served with exquisite arrangement. Service crews are very attentive, patience & hospitable which made my guests felt at home. Great experience.
5
We had an excellent experience with Summer Pavilion for our banquet. Personalized service and every details was taken care of. Food quality is excellent & cozy place.
5
Great service by Angel and her team with the service and recommendation of the dishes. Fantastic place to be at when you want to enjoy the service and food.
5
I was there yesterday night with my friends to celebrate one of their birthday. The service staff were very attentive to our needs, as it was our first time dining in Summer Pavilion, the staff attended to our table recommended us their signature dishes and suggested food items that were suitable for sharing as we would like to try as much food as possible. During our meal, they also helped us to portion out every dish to our convenience and we really appreciate that. Food was really delicious, especially the lobster noodle and Iberico pork with honey sauce.At the end of our dinner, they gave a little surprise to the birthday girl by singing happy birthday song and bringing in the cake and gifts that we prepared for her beforehand. My friend was really really happy that night. Last but not least, a big thank you to the manager and staff who attended to us, we truly enjoy the delicious food and the excellent service provided for that night. :

10 of us have 8-course dinner at > S$140 per head with the wave of corkage charges in a private room. Service is attentive, warm and gentle. Ambience is classy and contemporary with soft music. Great glassware from Champagne, white, red to dessert wine. The food at this one-michelin star resturant is modern Cantonese, light and refine in taste and touch. Most importantly after a satisfying meal we felt healthy and not stuffed. The most memorable dishes are the marinated smoked London duck with Chinese tea leaves and the poached rice, estuary grouper, with ginger, salted vegetable, black fungus in fish broth. The bamboo clam is huge, fresh, juicy and cooked to perfection. Highly recommended if you enjoy fine Chinese dinning with your own wine
5
Just finished a wonderful NYE dinner - my 3rd consecutive year here and I'm very sure to be back again next year! Food was perfect and service was impeccable. Even though restaurant was operating at full house, the standard and quality still maintained. Great job team! Have a great 2018 ahead! :)
5
This is our favourite restaurant because it is quite honestly faultless. The food is exquisite, beautifully presented and consistently delicious. Chef Cheung and his culinary team never disappoint. The service provided by Manager Gary and his team of staff is the perfect balance between professionalism and care and being attentive without being stiff or overbearing. And the ambience is simply wonderful – the décor is elegant yet unpretentious, luxurious yet relaxed. Try it and you’ll understand
5
Had a birthday celebration at Summer Pavilion. Ordered the suckling pig and the peking duck to start. The peking duck was really good, comparable to Min Jiang. The suckling pig was by far the best I've eaten. Extremely flavorful and crispy. We had the famous fish bone soup and hot and sour soup, both were really really good. That was followed by the grouper fillet, which was cooked to perfection. Next was the wagyu beef, extremely tender and marinated really well. We also had the lobster noodles, tofu and some vegetables, all of which were very nice. For Chinese cuisine, the food served here is notch higher than most chinese restaurants that we've been to. From the decor and plating, to the service rendered by the staff, this place is really worth coming to the Ritz to experience
5
I suggest you do a reservation in advance and you will get a nice table. Lunch is better than dinner as it includes nice dumplings. The menu can be slightly confusing so take your time to understand properly and them order. Vegetarian options are nice too
5
Dined at this 1 Michelin Star for dinner & dim sum lunch while staying at Ritz Carlton Millenia in Singapore. Interesting & creative Cantonese dishes not typical of Western Chinese food. Service was exceptional after long wait for appetizer, which was annoying. But, plenty of signature tea, delicious! Dim Sum lunch was perfect with attentive staff & no delays in service. Staff remembered us from dinner previous evening. We are returning for another dim sum lunch after disembarking our cruise ship in Jan. Before flying home

Much preferred the decor of the older Summer Pavillion when it felt a little calmer and less ostentacious. But the new restaurant is nonetheless, comfortable.Wasn't too concerned with the one-star since Summer Pavillion had been one of the best Chinese restaurants in Singapore since it opened. The standard of the food remains excellent but it does come at a price. And with the star it received, its catered more to the well-heeled diner.Undoubtedly good food, but whether it was good value remains the question.Service was professional, unobstrusive but could have been friendlier
4
Voted one of the best Chinese restaurants in Asia, the Summer Pavilion lives up to the accolade. Order the Peking Duck and Suckling Pig!
5
Great ambience! Food and services are of high qualities and standards! Definitely will return again!
5
Could not fault the service, food and ambiance, as always!
Had the Peking duck and much dim sum!
Service top notched and they never allow your tea cup to be left empty.
Perfect way to enjoy a dim sum lunch on a weekday!
5
Ate here twice on a recent visit and loved it. You can tell pride and love goes into preparation of your food and the service is always perfect.
4
Steamed BBQ pork bun is not my favourite dimsum but their BBQ pork bun is exceptionally good. May be it is because it has preserved mustard and that added a little flavour to it.Their service is really top notch. The servers are very responsive and helpful.Definitely will return to the restaurant for family/friend gathering
5
We decided to go back Summer Pavilion again for friend gathering! Gery, the restaurant manager has recommended us dishes based on our dining preferences and dieatary requirement The cuisine that prepared by Chef Cheung and his culinary team always impressed our palate! Really deserved more than one michelin star!Simply love the peking duck, hokkien style fried rice with abalone, steamed bamboo clam with minced garlic and inoki mushroom Appreciated personalised service from the service team, Jeffy as well!Our guests are very satisfied and enjoyed the dinner and restaurant’s ambience.Thank you Summer Pavilion

For our last night in Singapore we decided what could be nicer than dinner at reportedly the best Chinese restaurant in the city? So we booked The Summer Pavilion. After all they boast of a Michelin star!Oh dear #1, there we’re at least four large tables of people having Christmas parties. Loud, boisterous, etc.Oh dear #2, the noise from the function rooms below made the floor vibrate under your feet and it difficult to hear normal conversation. These “sound checks” lasted for the one & a half hours we were there. We complained and asked for it to be turned down twice.Oh dear #3, some of the food was poor and we refused to pay for. Some of the other dishes were good.Overall it certainly wasn’t an intimate dining experience in a top class restaurant. The servers tried hard and the manager was very accommodating & I think embarrassed.Tip: if you want excellent Chinese food then go to The Four Seasons and book at table at JIANG-NAN CHUN. We went a month before we went to the Summer Pavilion and it was an enjoyable as this was disappointing
2
Considered to be a top Cantonese restaurant, Summer Pavilion leaves you with a cold, wintry feeling. They were out of Peking duck, the tea flavored duck, the Iberian pork and even the crispy chicken. This was at 8 pm. Out of everything good on the menu. Why have a seating at 8 pm or even pretend to have a diverse menu if you can’t get basic capacity planning right. We moved to fish - well, they were out of the grouper, the mainstay of their fish section. What a letdown. On a Thursday night too. Be careful about going to this restaurant - make sure you just haven’t booked a table; book what you want to eat or you will be left with the crumbs
1
Colony (next door at the Ritz) has a stunning atmosphere, but it doesn't carry over to this stuffy, badly laid out, incredibly cold (temp and feel) restaurant. Do not eat here as a single person. GIANT portions and no way to downsize.There are 4 menus, none of which make sense. When I asked for an explanation of the crispy chicken, I was told it was crispy chicken on a plate. No veggies, I asked? No. No rice? Nope. Just chicken on a plate. Confused, I asked a 100 more questions and quickly (?) realized that there was no way I was getting the authentic Chinese experience I wanted.Food was average at best. Service was deplorable. With so many good options in the city, don't waste your time here
3
The restaurant is a bit dark and gloomy and somehow lacks atmosphere. Our food took a while to arrive but when it did it was very good. The service provided by Pong Sook Xian and her team was friendly and very professional. This is an expensive restaurant (it is part of the Ritz Carlton hotel) so you will need to choose carefully if you are on a budget
5
Fine Chinese cuisine at this classic restaurant. Impeccable service, excellent ambience, delightful dishes. On top a great selection of wines and cocktails. Perfect place for an enjoyable dinner.
5
The food quality and service here is exceptional. This is a great place to bring your important guests be it for business or pleasure for exceptional quality Chinese food.
5
ambience is great to start of with.food is exquisite and service has been very detailed.they are thoughtful to offer longevity buns when they come to know it is birthday celebration
5
Excellent service and food thumbs up!!!! Especially to our server Soon Xian for her recommendations and attention to details. We will be back 😀
5
I love the food in summer pavilion. It’s really the best or near the best Chinese cuisine in Singapore. The food is delicately made and the service is sublime. Truly worth a visit.
5
Awesome food and service. Kudos to Chef Cheung for his creativity and team for excellent service . Special mention to Chun Wai and Angel for the 5 star service every time we are here and making my dinner here always so enjoyable and pleasant .
5
The attention to details and ambiance were great, and the staff were welcoming and friendly. They made sure everyone’s needs were well taken care of. Chef Cheung and CoCo ensured the dinner was a unique experience and the food was tailored to our tastebuds. I would highly recommend this place for all who would like to have a taste on Chinese food
5
Articulate and super tasty the inspirations of Cheung Siu Kong the Chinese Executive Chef of the Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore all in all amazed me. I eat at this place every time I come to Singapore, since it opened , this time alone two times and was never disappointed. But this time I was amazed and I consider myself very difficult to amaze. The scallop stuffed eggplant is a piece of art , the duck is exemplary and everything I tasted was either a great idea or a perfectly cooked known recipe. It is not cheap but it worths it. The surrounding and the stuff is Ritz standard, but you dont go there for that. It is the food that opens the door. If you stay at the Ritz do not miss it , if you don’t then put it very high in your list because I dont thing you will eat in many places better than there if you are looking for Chinese.
5
Had a 30-guests dinner recently and I have to say I'm very impressed by the attention to details of the servers and their Captain. The tea was seldom cold, wine was regularly toped-up. All my whims and fancies were well taken care of, so thumbs up for Yun chieh, Yoke pui, Fang jn and Angel. Thank you for helping me create that magical experience for my guests. Food and Décor wise, perfect
5
Great food in terms of taste, quality, texture, presentation and composition is a given at Summer Pavilion! But for my family, what really sets them apart from other restaurants in Singapore is their commitment to service excellence, attention to detail, and outstanding customer service! Summer Pavilion is my family's go-to restaurant for any special occasion and even at times when we just want a really good meal and be treated like royalty! Their team comprises many long-serving staff which says something about the culture and environment of Summer Pavilion-- it's a place you want to keep going back to
5
We hosted our extended family and everything was great! From the huge room to wonderful service staff and delicious food, we were very happy and will definitely be back again!
5
Enjoyable dinner with warm hospitality! Must try their popular tea - lychee oolong curated by Tea Bone Zen Mind add to the charm.
5
Been here twice and food is really good (try the razor or bamboo clams- really great!). I would definitely come back again. Only suggestion for improvement is service related. The first time the server had really bad breath and the second time they over serviced by talking too much/stopping by the table too frequently. I would come back for sure but with the hopes of finding a the right server
5
The revamped chinese restaurant that serve Cantonese delicacies as well dim sum (during lunch). The restaurant deco and the crockery used are added touch to the already delicious food crafted by Chef Cheung. My all time favourite dish is the double boiled sharks bone soup with fish maw. In my opinion, the best in town which i will crave for every few other months. Great restaurant to do business lunch, dinner with family and dim sum during weekends with friends
5
I was there last Sunday with my friends to celebrate my birthday. Firstly, everyone greeted and gave off a very warm and welcoming feeling when we arrived. They also gave good recommendations about which food to order, which tasted really good! The food and the portions were just right. Moreover, Coco and Yoke Pui especially surprised me with the birthday special arrangement and even sang happy birthday to me. All of these make my visit so unforgettable, so amazing and wonderful. Thank you so much for all the efforts and good services. I will definitely come back and recommend to my friend
5
We were celebrating my friend's birthday at this restaurant and our experience is phenomenal. We were very touched that they went extra-mile for asking whether this reservation was for any special occasion and they did prepare special gifts for us. We would like to thank everybody in Summer Pavilion for making my friend's birthday unforgettable, especially Yoke Pui and Coco. Thank you so much. Definitely will come back

My partner and I were looking forward to a chic experience in this Michelin Star restaurant; and booked a number of weeks in advance. We were seated at our table and decided on the 6 course special tasting menu. We ordered our wine separately as it seemed somewhat odd that the option of wine pairing only provided wine with three of the 6 courses. Now to the food and service: Where do I start ? To say that the food is not Michelin Star is an understatement. It was presented beautifully but ranged from tasteless to inedible. We sent the Wagu beef back as it tasted like four cubes of un-chewable rubber in a brown tasteless gravy. However, no one came to our table to speak with us about it. The food was just taken away and that was the end of it. Now to the service: It was terrible, not because of slowness but because it was table-waiting on steroids. The food for the following course was brought while we were still eating the earlier course. On two occasions the waitress stood at our table with a course in her hand while we were still working through the previous course. $500+ and 1 hour and 15 minutes later it was all over. The next time I want a good Cantonese meal, I will go to one of the many much cheaper and better food options available in Singapore
5
I had another lovely dinner at Summer Pavilion this evening! The food was delicious and wonderful, the ambience was first-class, and the friendly staff serving us (Coco, Yoke Pui and the team) made the evening very enjoyable and comfortable. Another excellent evening and would go back again soon
5
Doing our usual Sunday routine with family members to a afternoon dim sum session at a restaurant we have not visited.I must say the quality of food is superb and service is top notch as well. The latter is probably its not full capacity yet.I highly recommend this place if you want to impress someone or to enjoy some quality food.Obviously all these come with a price which is not cheap.I like the century egg congee the best
2
A really disappointing dinner. The food was good, the portion much too big eventhough asked for smaller portion. The service very lousy, especially when I ordered a very expensive live garoupa the fish was full of bones- quite impossible to eat- I ordered a bottle of Lynch Bages 2012 at a prize of S$:360.-- not once a person of the service team tried to refill my glass. Really forget this Restaurant. Not worth to go. Guido from Switzerlan
5
Compliments to Coco, Jacky, Siew Kee and the Reception- 6 stars service.
Compliments to the Chef and team - 6 stars food.
Thank you very much. Will be back.
5
For first-class service, enjoyable food and great ambience. This is the first place to think about for awesome dim sum
4
Wide open spaces, delicious food and comforwble setting for business or leisure. Often at the forefront of incorporating unique treats from other countries e.g. introducing the crushed peanut w yam ice cream wrap that started a craze in Taiwan. Will be back!
5
Recently had lunch in this amazing restaurant with my fiancee who is vegetarian.Surprisingly awesome and delicious food, even it was vegetarian meal!I do really cannot imagine how nice michelin meal is and will definitely try soon.The hospitality and service of all of their servers were amazingly awesome and made our meal more delicious.I strongly recommend to vegetarians who are hesitating to visit this restaurant.Their vegetarian meal is awesome as their normal dishes
5
1 of the best and classiest chinese restaurants in singapore. Not cheap, but it's the ritz carltonTo avoid brain freeze from looking at 5 different menus, we opted for the set lunch (there were several choices)Service is very good and exquisiteThe food in the set is ok, but not outstanding. I assume a la carte will be bette
5
We dined there with cluents for business. The restaurant was very kind and patient enough to custimize the course.Food: The food is great with good presentation. I am sure they are using fresh and ingredients with good qualities. Service: Excellent. Professional attitude.All guests enjoyed the feast
4
We had the Lily Menu - 5 course comprising the Duo of Prawn: Deep-fried Head and Tail, Salt, Pepper, Chilled Prawn, Sesame Sauce; Braised Birdâ€™s Nest Soup, Boston Lobster Meat, Bamboo Piths, Diced Asparagus; Pan-fried Sea Perch, Crispy Ginger; Braised Rice, Diced Abalone, Chicken, Mushroom, Asparagus and Dessert of the Day (they served us Mango, Pomelo, Sago). The dishes were all good but not stand out good with the exception of the pan-fried sea perch. That was very well done. So evenly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. We all enjoyed that very much. The restaurant and table setting were very nice. Overall it was a pleasant dining experience. The only oversight was the chair. They had different ones for different tables. We sat at the round table and the seat of the chairs there were slippery and did not give good comfortable support. Service was generally good and pleasant until towards the end of our meal when it took us quite some time to get any attention to ask for the bill. But they were rather full and busy. Would we go back? Just may be
3
Everything looked radiant at the Ritz, which we certainly should embrace. Service was decent. I was a little bit disappointed to see the waiter dropping red wine on my friend's glass and white table cloth. It appeared that he was not quite attentive to details. She was wearing an ivory-colored dress...please imagine what could have happened. All the dishes were presented in a beautiful fashion. If you plan to split a check with your friends, you may want to communicate it to the staffs from the beginning. They would need time to grab a calculator from the back.
3
Brought my mother here for dinner after making sure the restaurant was wheelchair accessible. The lift was small and took a long time but it was appreciated.The ambiance is great while service was top-class as mentioned by other reviewers. We ordered Peking Duck, fish noodles with lobster meat, soya sauce prawns, asparagus with scallops amongst others. What let me down was how average the food tasted. We had high expectations given their Michelin star rating but came away feeling a tad disappointed that the food did not match other aspects of our dining experience.Noticed that most of the tables were occupied by people conducting business and for that the restaurant is greatly suited. It's just that the food was nothing special
3
Nice ambient and service is good, they are very attentive to our needs. Food wise, I would say is above average, portion is small and over price. Personally I will not visit unless somebody invited me
4
Thank you Sharon for the kind assistance. She make us feel comfortable, specially in my special day.
4
Wide range of Cantonese and Sichuan cuisines I a fine setting with attentive service. Dine in comfort and
experience good service, food beautifully presented and tasted great. Dear His is an established old restaurant with a good reputation for fin foods.
5
Up a dreamy stairway into a heavenly Cantonese restaurant. We had the tasting menu and accompanying wines, which started with Cristal champagne, and it was one of those life memories. Subtle, arresting, fun. Do bring your big wallet.
3
Come here for lunch on Sunday, ordered dim sum and dishes. I can taste MSG in the dim-sum, after the meal makes you feel very thirsty.The food here is just normal and not impressive, I will not say it worth the Michelin star and does not worth the price. There are other better Chinese restaurants in other hotels in Singapore, so I will not come here again
5
Great room, with very informative and helpful service. We were unsure of how and what to order, generally a different apprach from the starter, main course etc. The waiter was great, informative on how much to order and combinations. We do not eat meat, but do eat fish. The dishes we ate were just fabulous, Prawn in soya, were seriously the best prawns we have ever had. Rice dishes in soup and without were great and the set fish dishes were sublime. Desserts were to die for and a nice touch of a chocolate cake for the birthday girl (with candle and discreet singing!). Could not recommend Summer Pavillion highly enough
5
I had the Tasting Menu here for a Sunday lunch. It was comprised of 6 courses: (1) Australian abalone, (2) Chicken Soup in a coconut, (3) Wagyu Beef cubes, (4) A small Lobster with asparagus, (5) Grouper with rice in broth, & (6) a dessert of hot sago pudding & crunch bar. Every course was absolutely fabulous. The Chinese Executive Chef Cheung Siu Kong stopped by my table to see how I liked the meal. The dining experience here was outstanding in all respects. They certainly deserve the Michelin star that they have earned
3
We mainly went there to taste the Peking duck, which was very good indeed. However, the rest of the food was SUPER average and too expensive for what it actually was. From a restaurant with 1 star Michelin I would expect the food to melt in my mouth. I was so NOT impressed. Lastly, the staff was so pushy to let us leave as at 22:30 we were the last table there. I wouldn't recommend it!
5
Had a family dinner here. As this is 1 star Michelin Chinese restaurant, the service was impeccable. The food was also beautifully presented in beautiful dinnerware and very tasty.There was a special "commercial" lift so that my mother who was in a wheelchair could get up to the restaurant.Nice ambience and food to spend quality time with friends and relatives.Expensive but worth coming for that special occasion
5
Disappointed at none of the 8 different dim sum dishes I ordered! This is quite a rare case even when i went to 3 or 2Michelin starred restaurants in HK or London. Services is flawless. Must try the yam pumpkin, lobster wonton, lobster roll and truffle vegetarian dumpling. Anyhow, dishes from the a la care menu including the signature poach lobster rice are not as good as dim sum...just good to so so
4
It's all that you would expect of a restaurant of that stature. I relish the simple things well done, like the Cantonese koey teow, sauce done with perfect stickiness and a tinge of burnt wok, or the roast duck, smoky and tender. The only disappointment was the vinegar Pork leg, which was slight light on the vinegar for my palette
5
This restaurant's layout and atmosphere may not be the best but the tasting menu is gorgeous. The array of sharks fin, lobster and mushroom delicacies prepared in small tasting portions is totally delectable. And it's not expensive.
5
Very elegant dining place with fine dining Chinese food. Subtle Cantonese style food, great soups and seafood, so are the noodle dishes, no complaints except pricey
5
Food was amazing
I got chicken and duck and also seafood vermilli
Enough to share between two.
Bill was 200 between two people which isn't too bad.
5
If you have not visited summer pavilion, you should hesitate no more.
This one michelin restaurant lives up to every bit of its honour.
5
A wide choice of foods varieties . I love as well the great ambience and the great service render by the staffs.
It is simply a delighting place to dine in.
4
Third time at Summer Pavilion. And because of the excellencies of their food and service, I chose this restaurant to celebrate my grandma's 81st birthday. Unfortunately, it was not as good as it used to be. Ordered the Peking duck again and it was wrapped less nicely, and was more dry than is used to be. Other dim sums we ordered were good still. But what I found disappointing was that despite prior notice that it was my grandma's birthday, nobody wished her a 'happy birthday'. I don't think a simple wish is too much to expect from a well-reputed restaurant
5
We having our dim sum lunch there, the staffs are very friendly and the foods are nice too, on the day my mother having some walking problem, the staffs specially on the lift for her to use and get down from the restaurant, foods are nice and price are ok, really enjoy our foods and will be back again
3
The table setting was elegant and nice but the room was far too cold. It took a long time for food to arrive and the order was mixed up. Communication between kitchen and services seem to be issued and staff only came back to tell the dish was not available when other dish has been served. Overall, it took more than an hour to have all food that we ordered on the table. Food quality was good though. The a la carte menu is quite limited and not much creation or quality to demonstrate the different between a normal Chinese restaurant and one star Michelin standard. We have seen better standard elsewhere either with star or no star for Chinese restaurant.The whole experience was unpleasant with the above. The manager did offer complimentary desserts for all of us. It was good gesture but it could not change our view on the experience
4
Evidence of the personal service you get when you're a guest at the Ritz Carlton Millenia, is being welcomed into this one starred Michelin gem after you stumble downstairs in a Jet Lag stupor without a reservation, or any clue that you're about to dine in one of Singapore's finest restaurants. The food and service was superb. My only regret it that I was too exhausted to appreciate this sublime experience. I do hope to return
5
Had dim sum lunch on Monday. It was close to perfect from start to finish! Dim sum refined and of the highest standards! Peking duck was one of the best I've had in my life. Chose to just have the meat after instead of frying it into noodles or rice. Fantastic decision! Service personal and warm without intrusion. Very happy to see that they didn't lose any of their shine after the Michelin star! Definitely still my favourite Chinese restaurant in Singapore after all these years
5
On my birthday I went to this restaurant to celebrate with my family! It was the most awesome experience starting from the ambience, food, cocktails and outstanding service.
Of course the Dim sums were exceptional!
4
Food was good,light traditional Cantonese cuisine. Great ambience and nice quite place for fellowship.
Staff was warm and friendly.
4
Service is still same as years ago, food has got so much better too after getting Michelin star, great food and great staffs
5
the best places for chinese cruisine and get together with family and friends!
Delicious food ! Will come again !
5
My third outing to this restaurant. Consistent, unique exquisite Chinese food and impeccable service. Definitely a must visit in Singapore.
5
Pleasant and beautiful ambiance without being too formal. Celebrated Mom's birthday and they brought us the traditional 'bao'. We had the Peony set menu which was wonderful and a good buy.
4
Hosted a business lunch for an overseas client. The dining experience was excellent and the staff attentive. Had the captain recommend a selection of dim sum and ordered a serving of the lobster fish noodle.The dim sum was exquisite - especially the fried prawn roll. The noodles was also out of the world. The noodle was made from fish meat and the broth was both rich and light at the same time
4
Overall experience of it is good cos nice food n ambience. As it is a treat so find it wonderful but pricing is at the high end side (inside Ritz carlton hotel).Great for business lunch or any occasion celebration to "test" it out. Will recommend to friends n family
5
We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Summer Pavilion inside the beautiful Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore. The food was fantastic. The service was impeccable and the diverse teas were glorious. We ate the different dishes family style and the overall favorite was the sweet and sour pineapple pork. A perfect evening

The place was nice and the food was nicer and the service was the nicest. Went for lunch with my family and wasnt dissapointed. The staff there was impeccable

Fabulous wine pairing. The iberico pork is fantastic, together with the wok-fried prawn. Fantastic duck & lobster!
5
One of my favourite place for good quality chinese food. Location makes it ideal for lunch meetings too.

lovely private rooms for a special occasion! very chic n classy! had been renovated 5 stars! all of us enjoyed the food and attentive service!
5
We booked the private room for 10 of us and the set dinner 8 course was amazing! Their staff serving us were very competent too. They deserve their Michelin status! Keep up the good work!!

We had been here with 6 persons to celebrate a colleagues 32 years service for our company as well as his upcoming retirement.We arrived at 7pm but had to way for 2 colleagues for 15min as the had been stuck in traffic. Not that I had to explain to 3 waitresses seperately that we still wait for the round to be complete and again been asked if we are ready to order now every 5 minutes... as we got complete (which had then been 7:15 and therefore still early for Singapore for dinner) at least 4 of us wanted to order the "Chef tasting menu" with the pairing wine menu as promoted either online as well in the restaurant as we got the menu. But (just to repeat it at 7:15pm) we had been told the Chef tasting menu is sold out now.Asking for alternatives we got pointed to the regular menu overview which took as some time then to find another menu combination.Next surprise was then that there is no wine pairing offered for those menus and we therefore asked for wine recommendations matching to the courses. The answer of the (not really well english speaking) service was: please have a look in the wine menu yourselfAs the courses arrived everything was presented nice and tasted nice. But with the exception of the excellent scallop it was absolutely nothing special and for sure nothing you would expect in a 1 star Michelin restaurant. Please don't misunderstand. It was good quality food nicely presented but not worth the money paid. Combined with the service experience (another example... asking 3 times until the wine glas gets refilled is for sure not typical in a restaurant on that level... I am used to get it refilled even before you recognize yourself that the glass is going to be empty soon) and a SGD 1.400.- bill at the end I would definitively not come back

A friend of mine suggested me this one Michelin Star Chinese cuisine and I thought it would be spectacular, but my expectation was not good. The environment and the location are great (the Ritz-Carlton hotel), the service was good but the cuisine was just fine. I decided to choose the Dinner Menu and not A La Carte Menu. I have had the opportunity to visit many Cantonese restaurant in China for business with any Michelin Star and those were better than this one. Maybe I am wrong, maybe the Menu I choose was not as I expected and for that reason maybe I would give it a second chance.

The seasonal menu that's served in this Chinese restaurant is indeed impressive, starting with the choice of plating and cutlery used, followed by a range of nice and delicious seafood made into delectable Cantonese dishes, together with a little touched of Japanese fusion in the desserts. The dish I most adore is the fresh lobsters that tasted so good and delish! Thankful to the thoughtful staffs who gave me a cake and sang me a birthday song despite he's having a flu. The service rendered is admirable! One of the best Chinese dinning experience in a 6 stars hotel

I was fortunate to be invited for my company's CNY dinner this Feb 2017 to this famous restaurant. My friends have raved on FB about how good the food is, and when I heard this was the venue, I knew I wouldn't wanna miss this.And the food did not disappoint.You can taste distinctly the food was prepared with lots of care and attention, so the flavours are natural fresh and bursting on your taste buds.Lots of restaurants resort to MSG or artificial flavoring but Summer Pavillion I believe makes most of their flavours from scratch. This makes their food stand out.My colleagues and I all agree the food was delicious
5
The food is very good.Three must try dishes there.First is the bird nest stewed in a coconut. The stock is sweet and flavourful but clear. It is very different from the usual bird nest soup but much nicer.Second is the fish noodle and lobster soup. The noodle is made entirely from fish meat. What stands out is the sweetness of the soup. Thirdly is the pan fried beef in cubes cooked in Chinese style. Very tast
5
We have been there for my wife's birthday. We enjoyed the food the their service is good, like the waiter keeping topping up my tea cup.. we ordered the basic set meal for 2 people, the serving size not big but enough for our dinner. Some of them are really delicious. We definitely go there again. A good choice if you want to have a quite, good service and higher class environment for meeting with friends, anniversaries and other celebrations if you keen on Chinese food

Summer Pavilion had undergone renovation not long ago, to update its décor. The ambiance was nice, didn’t feel like I was in a Chinese restaurant. There were tables and booth for couples or groups who wanted more privacy. The lighting was dim, much like you would expect in a western restaurant, not a Chinese one. The table setting was so beautiful. The restaurant used exquisite china, full of motifs. The serving staff knew the menu well and could recommend signature dishes or dishes that would suit what we were looking for.Order the Double-boiled Sea Whelk Soup, Fish Maw, Chicken Served in Whole Coconut. The minute the dish was served, the smell of the coconut was wafting from it, making our mouths water. Smelling the soup, you would think that the coconut would overpower it, but it didn’t; the taste was just a hint of the coconut, giving sweetness to the soup.And the Pan-fried Japanese Wagyu Beef, Wild Mushroom. The meat was so tender, with so much marbling that it melted in the mouth. The mushrooms complemented the beef well, they had a char taste, as if it was fried with wok hei. Must try is the Poached Rice, Lobster Meat, which is Summer Pavilion’s signature dish. The rice is poached till crispy, somewhat like the texture of the rice at the bottom of claypot, giving it a nice crunch. The soup that it was in was so fragrant, like lobster bisque. The whole dish was so lovely, like eating rice crispies swimming in a lobster soup. I would definitely return just to eat this dish.What was special was the tea. It was not normal Chinese tea. They had tea with lychee and tea with roses. The server would be able to recommend a suitable tea to match the dishes you ordered.All in all, service, food quality and ambiance matches the Michelin stars it was awarded
4
we had soup, a meat platter, and some veggie + beef for two. the service was great and the food was good but it was hard to justify the price. for someone who's used to chinese food, I didn't find it mindblowingly tasty. you're paying more for the ambience and service
5
My wife and I visited Summer Pavilion from time to time and we always found it to be a blissful experience.The high ceiling, the sense of space, tasteful decoration, and the view of the well maintained Chinese garden through the large windows often gave us a luxurious feel and to an extent a modernized interpretation of the gardens in the past royal court in China. It's just soothing to be in that environment.The dinner atmosphere was a bit more formal than the lunch when dim sums were served, but service was still the Ritz Carlton's standards - friendly, attentive, and professional.Dishes were delicate, delicious, and with wide varieties; presentation was beautiful. It's representing the Chinese cuisines in a right way.It was a consistent enjoyable experience coming to Summer Pavilion
5
Everything about this lunch was fantastic. Incredibly good and attentive service, everyone that served me was warm and welcoming. The restaurant is a calm and relaxing place to be.I ordered dim sum from the lunch menu and it was all delicious - highly recommend. Fantastic restaurant, check it out if in Singapore.

We showed up for a weekday lunch expecting the restaurant to be barely filled. Turned out it was full and I secretly commended myself for almost always making a reservation as long as I know where I'm heading for a meal.Yes, do note that this Chinese restaurant was filled on a work day afternoon so remember to make a prior booking before turning up.The two staff who greeted us at the entrance were cool, not exactly haughty but not warm either. However, the ones serving the table were excellent. They were gentle yet professional, at ease, knowledgeable, sincere and not pretentious.The 5 course lunch set we ordered was very filling even though initially I had wanted to order something extra from the a la carte (I was eyeing the peking duck). I was advised against it. Turned out the waiter gave a good advise even though from the menu it didn't look like much.They were flexible enough to change the beef in the second course for one of us who doesn't take that. Turns out most of the dishes were good, and I really liked the broth of the noodle. I was a little disappointed to hear that the dessert of the day was mango sago but turned out it was really good - like having the liquid form of the freshest and juiciest bites of mangoes while in Thailand. Our Bird's Nest soup with fish maw was a little disappointing but it turned out much better after it was cooled a little. I'm happy with the dim sum too and the lychee oolong tea was delicate and lovely.The setting of the place is elegant for a Chinese restaurant with plenty of natural light. I just wish we needn't had to strain our ears or raise our voices a level above a quiet conversation.This is a well-deserved 1 star that I would love to return
5
It is not only beautiful display but also great food.Very special Chinese food as high quality with very fresh.Wonderful service. I really enjoy dinner set menu
5
We were a foursome for lunch at the Summer Pavillion. The couple who were Singapore residents ordered Peking Duck and a wonderful variety of small plates. The staff was attentive, quiet and the service smooth.All courses were based on the very freshest ingredients. All courses were exquisite.The mango, pomelo, sago dessert was new for us and a wonderful finish to our week in Singapore. The bill for four persons was quite reasonable. Summer Pavillion is not to be missed when in Singapore
5
Has been a patron of this restaurant for many years now. They had a recent renovation and have also been awarded with one star Michelin. The short dim sum list is good enough. The fish meat noodle with lobster meat is a must-try!! I can't rave enough about this. I must have this each time I'm there. If I have space for dessert, I will definitely go for the rice ball with sesame filling
5
Our family like the restaurant very much; we occasionally have our Sunday brunch there. Service staff is great as with most 5-star hotel restaurant.The DimSum selection is very good and some of the items are uniquely prepared by this restaurant’s chefs.My wife and I particular love the ginger-vinegar pork trotters

Loved the place to be, got a real good dinner and a perfect waitress who given us real good recommandations!

The minute you walk into this beautifully appointed restaurant you know you're in for a special meal. The decor is contemporary and relaxing. The host took us to our reserved table in a booth. It was fully set with dishes of soy and sweet chilli. The waitress came promptly with four separate menus per person. And she took drink orders. She was very unpretentious and helpful. We selected four dim sum items from their relatively small dim sum menu. The waitress offered to bring them in smaller portions so that we could have a greater variety. We also ordered two small dishes from the main menu. The dim sum arrived in short order. Their har gow was traditional and very good. No surprises, no innovative flourishes. We had a pan fried crab meat dumpling. It was quite different from the potstickers we had expected. It was wrapped in more of a pie crust like dough. It was very tasty and unusual. Their siu mai was a disappointment. It was heavy and rather bland with big chunks of shiitake mushrooms. No fish roe on top. We tried their deep fried lobster pastry. This was the biggest disappointment. It consisted of lobster meat wrapped in angel hair thin noodles. You couldn't actually taste the lobster meat - it could have been any shellfish. And the noodle wrapper was just annoying. You ended up in a cloud of tasteless brown fibres. I think this item should be removed from the menu. After the dim sum items we had their black pepper beef. This was outstanding. Bite size morsels of melt in your mouth beef lightly dressed in a delicate black pepper sauce. After that, we had their much praised fish noodles with seafood. These were very good. Permeated with "breath of the wok", and a lovely textured egg noodle-like dish. However, I was unable to detect any trace of fish which is supposedly a key ingredient in the noodle dough. Overall, this was a fine dining experience. However, in the Trip Advisor no. 1 restaurant in town with a Michelin star, I don't expect any disappointments. I would return but I'd be prepared for more pleasure - and disappointments - as I got to know their menu.

We have eaten here many times before. The setting is refined and is a western style restaurant and the service is very much Michelin. We had three dishes of which 2 were excellent. The first was asparagus wrapped in bamboo and the second a terrific grilled fish from their live fish menu. The third dish was their signature crispy skin chicken which was almost tasteless - almost as if someone had forgotten to marinate it first.The main problem was the temperature of the room. When the asparagus arrived after a 45 minute wait it was stone cold and was sent back. When it returned with the other two it was warm not hot but by the time we were half way though the meal the cold room has reduced the food temperature to barely luke warm.The problem as we saw it was the food was delivered to the dining room hot but then stood around while our waiter got round to serving it by which time it was cooling rapidly, Then with the room temperature at around 20C the food continued to cool.If the room remains at the current temperature the restaurant should look mat have the food on warmers.We will be back as two of the dishes were excellent
4
Posh environment. Spacious setting. Exquisite cutlery. Attentive service. Michelin-starred food. What more can I say? I highly recommend for a business lunch
5
Been here a few times recently and the dim sum are always made from very fresh ingredients and of high quality. They do not have all the traditional dishes (i want egg tarts with my dim sum), impeccable service and they give you fresh tea leaves. Love the bright dining room and cute plates
5
Atmosphere was great and the food was excellent. One of the best places for chinese cruisine and get-together with family and friends
5
This restaurent situated within the Ritz Carlton hotel offers great Dim Sum lunch as well as fine dining . The decor has a Chinese touch , view overlooking the entrance lobby area , pretty spectacular especially holidays time with decorations . We been here many times , everytime we visited the city , we dined here .( 20 plus times ) The service is friendly and very accommodating . ( We have small kids on some occasions ).

5
This is truly heavenly.Fantastic Chinese food. Great service - attentive and charming. Open - and good conversation.Go there.A dessert with macrones can be recommended - try the green and yellow :-) :-)
4
This restaurant is good but the atmosphere is so so. If you are in a big group it is ok otherwise you need to go elsewhere
4
On the whole service was excellent and food very good, one very minor criticisms is pace at which the food was served felt a bit rushed. On the whole though very good restaurant and I would definitely visit agai
5
Great ambience and service, of course good food served right in front of you. Ideal place for business and family gatherings.
4
An exceptional place with great food and even better device , went for lunch and had an awesome time
4
We were staying at the Ritz so we decided to try the Summer Pavilion since it has a 1 Michelin star. We tried a few dim sum dishes. The food was just average. The service was excellent. The price was very expensive
5
We had lunch at the Summer Pavilion in March 2017 - the whole experience was simply impressive. There was an, at first, bewildering array of menu options but these were, in fact very well organised and gave us an excellent selection of options. While its not our normal practice to order other than a la carte, we ended up choosing the Chef's Tasting Menu and we were richly rewarded for placing our trust in the Chef. Each dish was beautifully presented and gave us delicious and interesting flavours, each balanced perfectly with its prime ingredient. This menu - impossible to give it justice in a short description - included barbecued scallop, pan fried prawns, a clam soup, sautÃ©ed lamb loin, pan fried lobster, abalone and a particularly delicious green tea pudding dessert. We didn't choose the optional wine matching with this set menu, rather preferring to accompany the whole meal with a well-matched, dry and savoury Provence rose. This style of wine is all too often neglected as an amazing match with very high quality Asian dishes and it worked wonderfully with every dish. The service was very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive and, as a result, perfectly timed throughout. Located in the Ritz-Carlton hotel, the Summer Pavilion has a particularly elegant ambience and is clearly aimed at the high end of the market - and it delivers both exceptional value for money and a truly enjoyable experience
5
What a great experience eating at this restaurant. The food was beautifully presented and goes without saying delicious cantonese food. We chose the chefs menu which was a good choice as it was our first time. I loved the modern twist on Chinese cuisine. Not disappointed. It was nice to meet the chef on our departure, nice touch to the end of a great evening. Definitely would go back
5
Went there for birthday celebration for my mother. Service staff are very attentive and took notice that i'm a left-hander and swiftly make the necessary adjustment. Food are great, suits the taste of my family. Would definitely visit this place again
4
Food is very good, but not out of this world, but the ambience, the staff, and the decor make this place a must visit restauran
5
Thanks to Mr Colin recommendation for my corporate event @ Summer Pavilion, our clients were blown away....also like to thanks Gery & Chef Kong & his team for the exceptional service rendered & nice food, definately recommended for future corporate & family event
5
I always enjoy pulling into the driveway, and entering the beautiful lobby of Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore.Summer Pavilion dishes out well executed and modern Cantonese style cuisine.The quality of their dishes remained fine, although it was the peak period of Chinese New Year Lo Hei lunches.Thoroughly enjoyed my two back-to-back CNY client lunches at Summer Pavilion, but of differing menus.The various dishes on both menus were simply delectable, and flawlessly concocted.We were situated in their private dining rooms, to the left of the restaurant's entrance.Their efficient and attentive service is also recognised and appreciated, and befitting of a fine dining Chinese restaurant awarded One Michelin Star.This elegant restaurant and sophisticated hotel ambience, is very well-suited for business dining.It also accords a chic and pleasing place for celebrating special family occasions too.Highly recommended for contemporary Chinese cuisine of high calibre
5
Who would have known that a restaurant located in a hotel could be so elegant! Exceptional food and service, the perfect venue for a business meeting or dinner with friends
5
We loved the food and had a great time. Excellent quality and taste
We took recommendations from the server on what to eat and we loved everything. Will definitely come back.
5
High standards can be expected in this Michelin starred restaurant. But if you have more than 4 persons and like rice, you can try it the Chinese family way of dining with a bit of variation. First have the Peking Duck. The skin is used as an appetizer and the meat is cut up into succulent bite sized pieces which are stir fried. Count that as a dish to be shared. Then order 1 additional dish for every person. Have all the dishes served together. E.G. a beef, an abalone with vegetable, sweet and sour pork and prawn. Share a bowl of rice between 2 persons. And if you still want more, the fish paste noodle in lobster broth is a must try. A bottle of white will go beautifully with whatever is on the table
4
Very good high end Cantonese food in a delightful setting. Efficient service, extensive menu, all in all an experience that will be repeated
5
As we were not guests of the hotel, we had read the recommendation on tripadvisor and tried the food, as my wife loves chinese food. We had chosen the Peony Dinner Menue as we both don't like abalone. The overall welcome was very warm ans we had a nice table at the window. Distinguished atmosphere, absolutely attentive and fast service without making you nervous. The dishes were fine, authentical, the birdnest soup was excellent, also the main course. A fruitful jelly desert completet the tasteful menue. The tea service was as expected in a chinese restaurant, and we had also chosen a white wine from NZ which paired well. In between, unrecognized by myself, a small fruit fly dumped in my wine glass(what a great way to die...). I didn't see that until the waitress wanted to refill the glass, then she took it away, exchanged the glass and he as well as others came to our table to excuse this malheur, and offered a new glass extra. We refused it, in our mind not necessary, but typical for this kind of extraordinary service. Nevertheless, an expensive but tasteful experience, and, no doubt, worthy for a Michelin star
5
This has been our family's favourite Chinese restaurant for over 10 years. We have had many birthday parties and quiet family meals through the years. Throughout these times, the quality of the food and the level of service have been consistently good - long before being awarded their Michelin * last year. One reason is the low staff turnover of their key members and chefs who have an eye to details.Dim sum is served during lunch in addition to the ala carte menu. The dim sum is modern, light and delicate but still retains its traditional flavours like the steam pork bun (char siew pau) and fish noodle in lobster broth. The fish noodles are are made from fresh fish paste.I recommend their soups, all lovingly prepared from the heart. You can opt for the soups in the menu or try their soup of the day which is prepared like your Chinese grandmother would! While you are there, don't forget their crispy skinned smoked duck. The restaurant is popular with both locals and tourists. It is advisable to book ahead especially if you have a big group. Unlike other Chinese restaurants, large round tables are limited
5
The Summer Pavilion showed excellence in both food, service and timing. Certainly worth its Michelin star, and worth a visit, if you enjoy Cantonese and Chinese high level cooking.We went for lunch and ordered one of the set lunch menus, and had their great house tee.Not forced, but good to be open for ingredients as "birds nests", jelly fish"...The lunch time audience was mostly a blend of business, and social business people, as well as some tourists and surely hotel clients.Located in the Ritz Carlton hotel, which of course as well supports the positive experience
5
Brought my grandma and mum for dim sum. Their service is excellent, our waitress, Hui Leng is very smiley and friendly. When I called to make an appointment, they asked if I'm celebrating any occasion. Told them I'm celebrating my birthday and they offered to serve cake or lotus bun. Exceptional service even before the dining experience started.The dim sum were made of fresh ingredient and I love their poached lobster rice. Something new. Highly recommend this place for Chinese food!

Good foods and friendly staff. As the place is currently undergoing renovation, the signage is a bit out if sight but staff are friendly and helpful. Will go back again

Summer Pavilion deserves the mention and honor in its delicate dedication to culinary excellence. Our go-to restaurant for Chinese New Year almost every year, the atmosphere right down to the cutlery, speak of class and elegance. Food was just as refined - The Yu Sheng to start and sweet desserts to complete - Summer Pavilion truly deserved the Michelin Star accolade. The Marinated Smoked Chicken, Chinese Tea Leaves was a must-try. Skin melted in the mouth - flavored with sauces that did not overwhelm and the light tea complemented the tenderness of the Chicken meat. The steamed Sea Perch tasted much better than my last visit. Consistency was key and the sea perch tasted a lot more balanced this time (XO sauce and spring onion). The braised Mini Lobster meat, Noodles was a little bland for me and I could not quite taste the sweetness of the lobster meat but my friend begged to differ - he had two servings - could be my palate that was overloaded. But I was totally blown away by the Chilled Apricot, Fungus Basil Seed dessert - every ingredient was fresh, chewy, and all in the right proportions. The chillness was of a moderate temperature and did not make my teeth chatter. Now the wonderful service. Mr Gery Lee - the restaurant manager truly made the difference. He opened the evening with the traditional Chinese New Year greetings and did it with so much gusto - it immediately drove the guests' adrenaline levels up many notches. Smiles were on our faces. The staff was attentive - water and tea was filled without any prompting. They were always there but never intrusive. You could be chatting at one point, you turned and tea was surreptitiously filled. They are Ninja trained. Mr Jef was so cheerful and each time he came to our table, we just couldn't not smile along. Chef Cheung came to the dining room and the compliments he received showed how much hard work Summer Pavilion had put in to make a restaurant deserving and diners appreciated. And also special thanks to Angel and the many wonderful servers, I wish I could name you one by one, big thank you. Hard work would never go unappreciated. Happy New Year and thank you for making our Chinese New Year dinner a truly pleasant one

If you are looking for a good restaurant with great food and service look no further. The food was exceptional with great service and take the time to enjoy your surroundings. Enjoy the experience
5
I'd like to express my heartfelt thanks to the staff serving us when we celebrated my dad's 75th birthday. Special thanks to the Captain, Mr Jeffy Kow, who is one of the most patient staff I have ever come across in the service industry. He and Mr Chun Wai were also very thoughtful, they made sure that my son who was unwell felt comfortable by offering an extra jacket and warm water before I could even ask. Kudos to the excellent service Ritz Carlton Summer Pavilion Restaurant provided
4
The food is excellent. You certainly pay for the privilege of eating rarities like abalone, bird's nest or "monk jumps over the wall" but the quality backs it up. Being in a 5* hotel I found the ambience a little staid
5
In general the food is of a very high consistent level. We liked the soup. The noodles wasn't the special, but somehow even then it was very good. Pineapple tarts was perfect because it wasn't too sweet. Service was excellent.
5
Dim Sum is inheriantly our family tradition, and after trying a few worldwide, the Ritz Carlton is one of the best to-date! The variety was excellent, and it was refreshing to try new flavours uniquely to Singapore. The setting is absolutely beautiful, and very well patronised by Singaporean's - I always think this is a good indicator of quality. I already want to book again soon to try more of the menu (eg: order the peking duck in advance!!), and definitely a treat for any visitors to town - they will be very impressed
3
This restaurant has nice ambience, good service and food. Should have given it 4 star. Because of a kurobuta pork char siew I ordered. Poor quality and very expensive, that's why I gave it a 3 star
5
My cousins are the regular customers of this restaurant. The foods are of top notch quality. We always have the Dim Sum , Duck etc and it has never disappointed us. The chef is very friendly and frequently drops by to talk and appreciate the customers. The staff are so friendly. It makes you feel like family.What else can you ask for. It definitely deserves a five star rating
5
I had a family lunch here and it was easily one of the best experience for me, especially at a hotel restaurant. The variety was amazing and every single dish was unique in its own way, which was the most memorable aspect of my dining experience here. It's hard to choose a favourite but as a very picky eater, I enjoyed every dish thoroughly. Also had the honour of meeting the head chef in person. He is a humble and sincere chef - it is no wonder that the team had earned the Michelin Star award. Congrats and I hope to be back again very soon
5
A beautiful restaurant with tantalising dishes along with gorgeous chinaware. Intimate and sophiticated with impeccable service standards to match.
4
We visited on our first night in Singapore. The setting is nice (bigger that we expected) and the restaurant is obviously very popular, especially with the corporate crowd, but we didn't think it deserved the no 1 ranking on Tripadvisor. The food was good and the service reasonable, if a little curt, but there are better options for both quality, service and value available in Singapore
5
Perfect atmosphere for a family get together.I always bring my kids and the service is attentive with their needs.Real Chinese food, very well presented and good pricing. The restaurant is lovely, and the tables are far part for privacy.Would definitely be bac
5
Went for the set lunch for three.. Family outing.. First visit but didn't disappoint.. Extremely attentive service. Food was excellent and the servings was very well spaced out..
5
Amazing food. Classy cutlery. Fabulous ambience. Lastly, fantastic service. The must-haves are the lobster noodle (hands down best in Singapore), smoked duck with tea leaves, iberico char siew and steamed soon hock. It is perfect for family gatherings and business lunches.
5
Brilliant place for business functions and a great place to pamper yourself, friends and family.Must try: lobster fish noodle, Char Siew and steam soon hoc

Visited Summer Pavillon for family dinner with three generations on my birthday. My two daughters are vegetarians and we could find quite adequate vegetarian dishes to cater their need. Even though the dishes we ordered were not "pricey" dishes, we didn't feel any unwelcome attitude from them. We especially loved the tea smoked chicken. The chicken was tender and the favour of tea smoke was so well blended. All other dishes were very delicious too. My daughter mentioned about my birthday to the waitress and I was treated with a plate of Chinese buns at the end of the meal. Would like to especially mention about Yoke Pui, she served our table very well. We could feel her devoted hospitality and lovely attitude. Also want to mention the manager Gerry Lee, he was attentive and chatted with us by the end of the meal. We felt very warm and welcomed! Would highly recommend this restaurant to all!
5
My hubby and I decided on this restaurant among the options we had. When we went down to view the venue and finalised the details, the staff was friendly and accommodating to the our requests even to last minute changes on the day itself. The crew provided excellent service and awesome experience for our guests. We received positive feedback even after our big day. The spread was incredibly good. Certainly won't disappoint if anyone is planning a private event over there
5
You definitely get more than what you pay for when you sit down in the Summer Pavilion. Food was absolutely delicious and service was unparalleled, with each course being served quickly and waiters attentive to our needs. The roast pork and scallop fried rice are must-trys
5
Truly deserving to be recognized by the Michelin Guide! Service was more than attentive without being obtrusive, the manager, I believe his name was Gery was friendly and helpful and recommended some dishes and we were not disappointed, the lobster with crispy rice is a MUST try as is the Peking duck. I would highly recommend this restaurant !!
5
classy but quirky decor, very good service with wonderful tea constantly refilled. very extensive dim sum and cantonese men
5
We were celebrating our parents' 50th Golden anniversary. It was one of the most elegant and fine Chinese dinning that I'd been too; pricing is on the steep side. The room was beautiful with soft lighting and ambiance. Shirley was extremely attentive; she was our dedicated service attendant in our private room. She did a really good job! The dinnerware was beautiful and presentation was outstanding. The food was delicious; wonderfully presented, perfect temperature and portion served. The staff was friendly and offered to take pictures for us along with well wishes and an invitation to return
3
Cuisine was good as expected but the new ambience is not as nice as before; not befitting for a grand hotel like the Rit
5
One of the best Chinese meals I've had and the staff is super friendly with some of the best service I've seen. Great ambiance as well.
5
There are many other refined and widely famous Cantonese restaurants in Singapore - such as Lei Garden, Li Bai and Hai Tien Lo. Summer Pavilion stands out in terms of how refined it looks and tastes like. It is at the stage so refined that most picky Westerners with lower 'exotic' food acceptances can enjoy it without much issues
3
Food quality is good. Service staff is attentive too, they are able to pay attention to the requests of the customers in spite of their busy schedule
5
We dined at this superb restaurant and nothing disappointed. The service by the staff was efficient and unobtrusive as should be expected at such a fine dining restaurant. Every dish was executed with delicacy and finesse and showcased the Chef's skill over the wok. Definitely deserving of the star from Michelin. The decor should also be highlighted. Excellent lighting and decor that delights and does not detract from the main theme - elegant chinese cuisine and service. Polished table tops with beautiful chinoiserie crockery, starched linens and cutlery. I have been there several times and each visit has never disappointed but enhanced my desire to return and try their dishes.
5
Always a perfect experience when we return for a meal. The details and efforts that the Chefs does to the wonderful cuisine prepared to perfection is a total masterclass! Such a joy of experience that pinch all your senses and taste buds!!!!

Recently we went for business lunch @ Summer Pavilion and all of us ordered the same set lunch. The ambience was nice ,the cutlery was very impressive & the staff were courteous & polite with smiles on their faces. We enjoyed the food, which was fresh, delicious & serving was decent. I would certainly look forward to patronise the restaurant again & highly recommend it to anyone who likes Chinese food
5
This is our second visit to Summer Pavilion for a birthday celebration. The service crew, especially Miss Wan, were very attentive in topping up our tea. Impressive dishes include the crispy rice in lobster broth, spring rolls, and the red bean pancake. Overall a great experience

I like the dumpling soup so much ,all the dishes oso quite good and good service.but better make reservation first because will ful

We went to the Summer Pavilion for a celebratory dinner and the restaurant was kind enough to waive the corkage charges for our bottle. I also had a gluten allergy and the waitresses and chefs were able to accommodate, which is pretty tough in Singapore, especially for chinese food. Love the lobster rice and smoked tea duck. Agnes, in particular, took great care of us and she made our dinner even more enjoyable. Food is amazing, service is impeccable; deserves more than one michelin star if you ask me

I decided to revisit the Summer Pavilion in The Ritz Carlton after it attained its 1 Michelin star status this year. I was pleasantly impressed with the transformation. Eye-pleasing decor and colorful crockery and most important of all, the Cantonese cuisine had gone up by a notch. The marinated smoked duck was tender and delicious. The bamboo clams laced with garlic were certainly better than those similarly sold in the countless seafood restaurants in Singapore.Not surprisingly the restaurant was packed and vacated tables were filled quickly during the second sittings. Here is the downside, the service staff struggled to cope with the large number of diners. Many a time we had to signal to the staff to catch their attention.The Ritz, known for its service, should take note of this

Summer Pavilion is a 1 Michelin star Cantonese restaurant in The Ritz Carlton, Mellenia Singapore. The food is good and well presented while the ambience is very pleasant. However, what was most impressive was the excellent service. The staff members have very good service attitude, were attentive and anticipate well what customers need. All of them serve with a genuine smile. In my view, this is one of the best Cantonese restaurants in Singapore. A great venue to entertain guests and for a family meal
5
We had heard of the Michelin Star reputation of Summer Pavilion when we chose it to celebrate a job promotion in the family. We had heard of the outstanding Cantonese fare one could expect but what we got truly took our breath away! Item after item challenged our taste buds with the sheer subtlety of taste and served as it was on exquisite china, each serving plate differing in a myriad of colours.....pink, green, blue, off white, pure white....we were truly impressed beyond words! The ambience was classy truly befitting the Ritz Carlton Brand in every way!! We started with Vegeterian Hot & Sour Soup followed with Sautéed Lotus root Black Fungus Bean Curd for Starters. Our main course of Vegeterian Fried Rice, Braised Bean curd mushroom seasonal vegetable and Deep Fried crispy noodles was truly out of the world! The meal was so satisfying as served, we practically didn't need to add any extra sauces at all. Truly amazing
5
Great service, great food, and very appealing presentation. Especially loved the china, as each dish was on a different pattern, very colorful, even the tea pot
5
Recommended by an Australian family we met on our trip to Marina Bay and we were glad we did it. Staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was excellent, roasted duck was the best, and the Jasmine tea was fragrant. Highly recommended
5
love the food and especially the service! Special thanks to captain fong sook xian for the hospitality! Will definitely be back :)
5
Had a mega CHinese meal here, really very good, with presentation and service well above what you would find in most Chinese restaurants, and akin to a very high level banquet... but very expensive
5
I attended a work dinner and was thoroughly impressed by the eight course dinner.The duck skin in the entree was very crispy.The bird's nest soup was light and refreshing.The marble goby was nicely done, moist and not smelly.The smoked chicken was juicy.The duo of vegetables with black garlic was delicious and not chewy.The braised Hong Kong noodle was flavoursome.The chilled green apple with assorted mushroom was cooling and not too sweet.Service was great. Presentation was excellent. Deserving of 1-2 Michelin Star
5
Very refined food. Quiet and able to speak! Attentive staff and good service. It was dim sum - TOP 3 in spor

Beautiful china enhances your eating experience and really the most delicious food. Very light and beautifully cooked. Always. The best dish for me is soup with crispy ric
4
Service was nothing less than you would expect of Ritz-Carlton - very professional and welcoming. Menu had all the usual Cantonese favourites and all dishes were well prepared. On some, I just thought quality of ingredients could have been slightly higher eg char siu a little more tender. Wine list was fine but could have been more extensive. I'll certainly return but for Michelin star 5* Cantonese, try HK.
5
This is the fourth time for me to be in Singapore and this is one of the best cantonese restaurants in town. Staff is very friendly and the food simply is excellent !
5
Very nice and good cantonese food. We had different dishes recommended by Ms. Xian. She dis a great job! Absolutely delicious.

Went there with my family recently. As the reviews were relatively high, we had loads of expectations when i went over, but I was a little disappointed with the choices that were offered to us. It was quite limited and the serving portions were quite small. I love the soup though but I didn't quite like the fish. The bill was on the high side but considering the service and quality, I would have expected that.
5
It was my birthday dinner and though I was elated that my 90-year-old grandfather could join, I started off a little worried for his comfort and convenience. But the staff on Monday night were so amazing and accommodating, at some point I even forgot standing up to help grandpa myself! Jeffy was a real great help and such a delight - I am so glad he introduced us the lychee oolong tea, love it! The 'shou tao' birthday cake was a sweet sweet surprise too! thank you all, we will definitely be back :
5
We went there for a birthday celebration dinner and it was indeed an unforgettable experience!Ordered the Peony Menu and the Sea whelk and chicken & fish maw soup in coconut shell was out of this world....worthy to be the "Chef's signature dish"! In fact every item on this Menu is really yummy, although I would pick the South African lobster with HK noodles in special broth to be outstanding!What is good food if service is average? We were not disappointed as the service level is 5 stars from the moment i rang them to make reservations...Would like to mention in particular the Captain, Lee Chun Wai, who was extremely alert and saw to all our needs, from arranging for the birthday buns to be steamed just nice before serving, taking our photos and helping to cut the ice cream cake...to making sure that our Riesling is chilled to our satisfaction and asking how each dish was after every serving and escorting us right up to the staircase to point the direction of the restrooms!! The other service staff was also commendable; she offered my pregnant daughter-in-law a shawl when she just so mentioned that the place was a bit cold, anticipated what condiments we wanted and the wet towels were changed after every 2 dishes!! Needless to say, this is one restaurant where we are not invisible to the service staff!!Highly recommend this One-star Michelin restaurant for those who look forward to having a very pleasantly memorable meal with loved ones or to show foreign friends and colleagues what superior food and premier service is all about

We had a 7 course meal family gathering In the private garden suite. We had met with them the week before to discuss the menu we wanted. They were very obliging with the changes we requested to have the exact menu for our guests. The tables were elegantly set. Lovely table and silver ware. The service was excellent. Each course was served timely with enough time in-between courses to chat and enjoy the atmosphere. We had decided to take our own wine which they were happy serve. They do have a corkage fee which they waived for us. A great bonus. All I can say about each course is fantastic. The chef gets top marks. All our guests were very impressed with the whole evening
5
Perfect roasts, rich braised dishes matching our full bodied red wine.Delicate steamed bamboo clams. Fragrant Lychee Oolong tea.Service was attentive and friendly. Chief waitresses clearly knew their house specials and made good recommendations.Peaceful , elegant ambience . Love the beautiful bonsai
4
I was there after the renovation and didn't expect the food to be good (the food was average for many years). It became one of the 3 Chinese resturant I like in Singapore. N I have to comment , their chairs are very comfortable although it might not be the best match with their deco...

Very Praiseworthy:- Excellent Service throughout the night. My compliments to the staff- Beautiful Private Room- Creative design/taste of complimentary longevity buns- Impressive Lychee Chinese TeaMemorable Dishes in the Daffodil Menu worthy of Michelin Standard: - The 4 Platters served as a first dish- The Bird's Nest Soup- Soon Hock Fish- The Veg Dish*What I like least: The HK noodles and the dessert.A very close to Excellent rating, if not for these 2 dishes
5
Delicately made dim sum with fresh ingredients and fabulous service. We always order the dumpling in soup and it never disappoints
5
Exquisite authentic Chinese fine dining with attentive service. Lovely decor, well spaced out tables. Truly deserving of its 1 Michelin star.

My daughter organized her father's 68th birthday celebration at Summer Pavilion, Ritz Carlton Singapore on 21 Oct 2016.The captian, Ms. Wan Yoke Pui and her teammates warmly welcomed us. Ms.Wan recommended a decaffeinated Chinese tea as I cannot consume chinese tea which contains caffeine, at night.She also recommended some dishes such as Chicken smoked with jasmine tea leaves, Fish noodles with lobster meat in lobster broth and Asparagus with four different types of mushrooms in oyster sauce.We ordered the dishes recommended by her and also the soup of the day which is Melon with pork soup. The foods and the soup were very delicious. We were given the longevity buns as a surprise free birthday treat. This is a very good gesture from the restaurant which we appreciated very much.We also ordered the fried red bean pancake as our dessert . The red bean paste was very fine and not too sweet. The crust was very crispy and thin.Overall, we were impressed with the fine dining experience such as the delicious food, excellent service and great ambience.We would certainly come again to taste the other chef's recommendations. We would like to thank Ms Wan and her team and also the chefs for making my husband's birthday celebration a truly memorable and enjoyable occasion.Mrs Rosie LeeSingapore21st October 2016

The restaurant has a simple, understated decor in muted colours with soft warm lightings, very unlike some "uppity" Chinese restaurants, yet the ambience exudes a certain elegance, warmth and cosiness. Service is very good and attentive.. Love their menu selections of tasty dim sum and Chinese/fusion food some of which are quite unusual. It was my first visit to the restaurant after some 3-4 years. The decor has been completely revamped...it is definitely much better now. The food is certainly more than worthy of their 1 Michelin star status but yet not that pricey as to put one off dining here. This a restaurant that one can visit often to savour the excellent food, either with family and friends or for business lunches/dinners, besides enjoying the prompt attentive service and warm conducive ambience...I am looking forward to dining here again soon to try more of the other dishes on their menu.

I'd a wonderful dining experience at the Summer Pavillon last weekend, thanks to the attentive and friendly team. Now, I'd been to fine dining a on several occasions but very few had given me the service Summer Pavillon had. Also, it's very nice of them to offer a complimentary cake as we were there for a birthday celebration.I like the atmosphere too. Dim (the downside is that it makes reading the menu a bit hard) and relatively quiet compared to many other chinese restaurants. The tables are not close to each other which makes it more comfortable. Lastly, I really enjoyed the food. It's a little more expensive than what you get in Crystal Jade type but it's well worth the price! Their peking duck is worth mentioning because they used egg crepe instead of the traditional pancake we usually get. Personally I like both types, but my boyfriend preferred this egg crepe (for reasons he couldn't explain hahahah). Overall it's recommended and I'll definately come back again to try their dim sum selection. Thank you team for making the dining experience a memorable one
4
I had ordered their Michelin star dinner set menu. Every dish in the menu is yummy and the tea is fragrant (not to be missed). The staff is very attentive and keep pouring your tea when it almost empty. Overall, it worth the money that you are paying with such a good quality of food and service
5
Always impressed by the level of service and professionalism of the service team... Got married here years ago and as we came back to Ritz to celebrate our wedding anniversary... was pleasantly surprised by the complimentary cake arranged by the service staff... Shout out to Chun Wai for being so friendly and attentive. Thanks Ritz
4
Everything falls in place seamlessly here. Perfect service from start to finish, as you would expect. Food is slightly different, but not to the point of being "exotic". Presentation is flawless. Price is not for the everyday pocket.
4
The seating was perfect. The restaurant arranged for private seating for our size of 12 pax. Not to mention the food lived up to its expectations as well as the attentiveness of the service staff
5
Went for a business set lunch. Food was very good and waiters were friendly and attentive. Service was good. Ambience was classy and there was enough space between tables to be suitable for business discussions
5
Food quality remains consistently good even after being awarded 1 Star. Chef greeted us in the most humble fashion, and Assistant Manager Angel Pann provided excellent service
5
The Chinese food at this restaurant is authentic, the ambience was refined yet relaxing, and the staff serving us was very friendly and knowledgeable. Excellent meal overall!

I discovered this place about a year ago, and it has been my most favourite Chinese restaurant by far in Singapore. I had started becoming regular of this restaurant before out of the blue it managed to clinch 1 Michelin Star recently, a feat which I think is thoroughly well-deserved!There are several reasons why I put Summer Pavillion on the top of my list for Chinese cuisine in Singapore:- it is an "all-rounder": good for dim sum, traditional dishes, and fusion dishes. Hence, it is good for all kind of occasions any time of the day!- the ambience is simple but elegant, unlike many over-the-top Chinese restaurants. Starting from the warm lighting, the understated decor, the fine selection of china, the comfy chairs -- they make the experience complete.- the food quality is fantastic. Some of my favourites are: (i) barbecued Iberico, (ii) sautÃ©ed chives, (iii) sliced Wagyu beef, (iv) black-pepper fried rice with goose liver. If you go for dim sum, try out: (i) crystal dumpling and (ii) fried pumpkin & yam. Finally, my meal at Summer Pavillion will never be complete without the dessert of black glutinous rice with mango cubes and coconut ice cream.The service, too, is impeccable. One of the staff, Sook Xian, is extremely observant and friendly. She always remembers what tea and drinks I like, as well as my favourite dishes -- humanising the concept of fine dining and making me feel like I am dining at home. The gentleman manager (his name just slipped my mind...) is always impressive. One Sunday brunch I brought an important guest for dim sum without realising he eats glutton-free meals. I was worried, but the manager calmed me down and on the spot recommended all the possible glutton-free dishes without even looking the menu! The brunch was salvaged by the manager indeed! :)The wine list is fantastic too, but they are very pricey vis-a-vis retail prices and other restaurants. This does not bother so much, though, as I gladly stick with the signature soothing peach Chinese tea.Overall, if you wish to have a fine Chinese dining experience in Singapore, it definitely cannot get any finer than Summer Pavillion

Lets start off with Jeffrey, the kind waiter from China. He was the definition of service standard at a fine dining restaurant, perhaps even more. During my visit to the restaurant on the evening of 17 Oct 2016, he and the other servers provided near unparalleled service, better than some other fine dining restaurants that I have been to. Every dish served was carefully explained by the server, the Pu'er tea we ordered was constantly topped up and even replaced with warmer tea mid-meal, and asked about our satisfaction after every dish was cleared. They were considerate enough not to be intrusive, providing exceptional attention to details. On to the food, the quality was nothing short of outstanding. Living up to their Michelin star, perhaps even more than the 1 star they achieved, was their special degustation menu created by Head Chef Cheung. The meal was 6 courses, filling enough for the average Joe, and was made up of special dishes created by Chef Cheung that won an award post-Michelin, according to Jeffrey. The appetiser of Iberico pork and abalone, and the main course of lamb loin were the highlights of the seasonal degustation menu, which will change once every 3 months. The bill was $340 for 2, including tea and taxes. Expensive, no doubt, but worthy meal for the quality of food and more for the service that is of Ritz Carlton hotel standard
5
Great decor, great service n an interesting menu. The restaurant serves a variety of dim sum for Saturday n Sunday lunches and includes a interesting array of casual Cantonese small plates such as beef brisket, congee and such like.Nice place to enjoy a dim sum outing with family

We visited early September. We were excited to try this Michelin Star restaurant. We opted for the chef`s menu but when I told our waiter Jeffie (hope I got the name right, sorry if it is spelled wrong) that I read about the chef`s lobster dish in an article which was not part of the menu he told us that he can substitute the set menu item with my lobster rice dish. I am glad he did because it was so delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed the creativity of the dishes and each was delicious. Jeffie was attentive and I would like to give special thanks to him. He is the first person in a restaurant to notice that one person in our party was left handed and then proceeded to reset the table for the left handed person and place dishes accordingly including the tea cups etc. This level of attention to service and detail is pretty impressive. Our only regret was that when it came time to leave he was not available as we wanted to specially thank him. Jeffie gave us the possibility to try some of the mooncakes as a special dessert treat and they were so nice that we bought several boxes to take home to give to friends and family back home
5
Great meals, well designed dinning rom with large tables for two or 4 on the side in an alcove, the best service experienced so far in Singapore, so kind.They help you in your choice and don't push you towards the most expensive but leave the choice entirely to your, even if you just take a collection of starters.Also the best price-quality ratio for a classy restaurant like this.We will return, no doubt
5
We were in Singapore as part of an extended annual holiday to celebrate our 30th. We were attracted to the Summer Pavillion as we always like to eat local food and this is reputedly the best Chinese Restaurant in town. We went for the Michelin menu. I was a bit disappointed that only one set menu was available, but the a la carte was so extensive I'd never have made up my mind. I won't go through each course but the food was really superb; by far the best Chinese I've ever had. It is rather soup-based, or at least a couple of the courses are accompanied by a broth. Also the dessert didn't quite reach the standard of the rest but I think that's a matter of personal taste rather than the quality of the cooking. The fight of wines is reasonably priced and very good quality but servings are not huge - just over half a glass of each. At around SG$ 100 for the menu and SG$ 48 for the wines (both plus tax and service) it's not cheap, but noting in Singapore is. compared other meals we had there it's good value for the fantastic quality. Service is excellent as well
5
We ordered a set Michelin lunch. Our favorite are Fish maw soup and BBQ pork. Great food Great Service. Will definitely come back. Nice place.
5
I was bowled over by the stunning ambience, & attentive service. The Cantonese cuisine is good, but not outstanding. My baked crab was ok, a little on small side. The fish noodles with lobster broth is recommendedOverall an enjoyable experience, & prices are reasonabl
5
Stayed in Ritz Carlton hotel and was invited to dine in this restaurant because of the Michelin Star menu. The five course menu was very well presented and the flavours from each course were delicious. The double-boiled sea whelk soup, fish maw, chicken served in a whole coconut, were so good on my taste buds that I drank every drop of the soup! The rest of the dishes were also unique and interesting as well as being beautifully presented.I would certainly recommend to try this delicious menu
4
Stylish ambience. Love the designer plates in which food is served on. Pretty plating can make food seem tastier :) Service was excellent! Thumbs up!
5
We had 5 customized course based on staff's recommendations. They are appetizer cram , soup, fish, and fried rice, then dessert. All dish are excellent and my guests are so happy and told me it was unforgettable experience.
5
First visit to summer pavilion , everything was seamlessly great . Every staff on the floor that day provided first class brilliant service to my table coupled with great fine food. Never had to ask for anything yet they greet by name , truly the ritz Carlton . Thank you to all staff working on 25th of August 2016. Great job and keep it up ! Will definitely visit again !

Dining experience at Ritz Carlton can never go wrong. This time we were at Summer Pavilion for Chinese cuisine. This is the first time I came back after the restaurant has achieved a Michelin Star recognition. The last time was quite a few years back for dim sum and it was very good. We came for dinner to celebrate husband's birthday. We started with lychee wulong tea recommended by attending staff and it was very pleasant tea with mild hint and fragrance of lychee. We picked the Michelin Star set dinner because we didn't want to think too hard. It was well worth the money. The set consisted of iberico pork, abalone, sea whelk fish maw soup, Wagyu beef, poached rice with groupa and sweet almond tea. All was exquisitely done and wonderfully tasting. All of us love the double-boiled soup, delectable and nutritious. The Wagyu beef was so marblery and flavourful. Poached rice and groupa was drenched beautifully with milky fish soup and crispy bits added to an interesting palate. Service staff was very attentive, always there when we needed them but not intrusive and offering to take pictures for us without us having to ask. I credit this to good training and motivated staff. The entire dinner experience, from ambience to service to delicious good food and that consistent good vibe the moment you stepped into hotel and restaurant till you leave, all worthy of a six-star hotel
5
My first visit was in February 2016, before the Singapore Michelin guide was published. I was impressed by the superb service and quality of the food although the variety was constrained by the Chinese New Year menu.This time, the service was equally good, meeting high professional standards with a warm touch. My friends and I were able to try a wider variety of dishes this time, among which the steamed fish and lobster were the most delicate. While the chef managed to retain the traditional flavor of the dishes (without the oiliness often associated with such traditional handling), the fresh taste of the fish and lobster were not compromised for one bit. The E-fu noodles that made with the lobster came as a pleasant surprise.The desserts we had (purple sticky rice with mango; mango, pomelo and sago sweet soup; and almond sweet soup) were good. But if you like fruity tea, a must-try is their lychee oolong - it not only have the fragrance, but also a rich flavour of lychee that blossoms in your mouth and leaves you with a uplifting after-taste.What I've found to be most pleasant is the attitude of the staff members, whose egos have not inflated after garnering the Michelin star. Quite the contrary, they were still caring and trying to improve in every aspect. This humility and eagerness to do better will go a long way
5
We would like to express our appreciation of the outstanding service we received at the Summer Pavilion where we celebrated our dad's 70th birthday on 13th Aug. The service, atmosphere and food were excellent. Our guests had a fabulous time! Our heatfelt thanks to Gery Lee, Sharon Li and Lee Chun Wai for making our dad's birthday celebration a memorable one
5
One of the best quality restaurants offering Chinese cuisine in Singapore, with signature dishes such as :1. London Duck - equal the best tasted at Four Seasons or Royal China Club in London.2. Double-boiled chicken soup with fish maw and sea welk - one that all my lady guests love it so much that they wanted to ask for more because the clear soup emits strong fragrance of high collagen;3. Lobster rice soup - taste of freshest and juicy lobster cooked to right balance (not too soggy or too tough) in broth of secret recipe; 4. Garoupa - steamed dong xing ban in minced garlic, truly tender of highest order; 5. Bamboo claim - again very fresh sweet taste without any hint of raw smell.6. Fresh crabmeat stuffed in shell - well served as appetizer paired with rose champagne.The dishes went down well with progressive drinking from champagne through Nikka Takesuru whisky to Moscato d'asti in gentle proportion. All in all, a thoughtful sumptuous lunch blended with the joy of national day holiday
5
Celebrated my husband birthday there, delicious food with beautiful presentation, good wine selection, service is warm and attentive. We look forward to next visit soon
5
This is a stylish, professionally run restaurant with very good food. The dishes themselves (the ceramic dishes) are all very pretty which adds to the enjoyment
5
Best service we experienced in Singapore, best Chinese food we had in Singapore, and the ambiance was great i.e. it was not as loud as in other comparable restaurants. The food was amazing, my wife had the Michelin star menu, of which every course was delicious and portion sizes were adequate. I had the tea leave smoked duck and their fish noodles; delicious but definitely too much. The restaurant is at the very high end of budgets, but definitely worth an experience on a special occasion
5
The service was impeccable and the Food deserves a much higher Michelin Star . The Price for such experience is frankly very fair and affordable.
5
The ambience and choice of food with such great quality is a must try. The efficiency of the staff with a smile adds to a truly great dining experience.

honestly, I expected more from here but the food did not wow me. the service is good but they forgot my soup..
5
Coincidentally, me and my friends were dining here on 21 July, the night when the Michelin awards were announced for Singapore. So we got to congratulate them on a truly deserved one Michelin star. We sampled three of their chef's recommendations (note there are two different lists - one similar to the one on the website, which is part of a larger ala carte menu book, and the other a separate flyer list).The BBQ Iberico pork in honey sauce, baked cod fish, and poached rice with lobster meat were all sumptuous. In addition, we also liked the signature marinated farm chicken smoked with Chinese tea leaves (the smoked duck is the more popular version), bamboo clams and spinach vegetables. Prices were reasonable for the quality. Service was very good, and the ambience refined, not your typical noisy Chinese restaurant. It's a good place to go for special occasions. They also waived the corkage for our champagne which we appreciated.
5
Very friendly, professional service. Delicious, always surprising new inventions, dim sum, definitely the best in Singapore

Dinner with Family and friends from Thailand @ Summer Pavilion @ Ritz Carlton, Singapore.Think the best were the barbecued suckling pig, the fried pork from the suckling pig and the soup.The rest were good too.Overall a good meal.Wines were good too, thanks to our friend for the recommendation.The last photo is that of a cake

1. Service obsequious 2. Food unsatisfying3. Menu limited4. Wine prices over the top5. Overall cost of $450 for two is totally unjustifiable.
5
My first time in Singapore and saw that Summer Pavilion has an excellent rating on Tripadvisor. As it was the most convenient option right at my hotel, I went for dinner on 2 of the nights I was in townThe food was well executed with the texture and taste of food being of excellent standards. The soup that I had was comparable to the best restaurants in HK. Also, after trying other options in Singapore, we went back for a 2nd round on our last night in Singapore as it was a clear favorite in our party
5
To celebrate our friends' birthdays, we booked a room here. It was my first time here. And I have to say I was sold. Service was good. Especially the waiter in charged of our room, Kelvin. He was attentive and always attend to our needs promptly. We had the dinner set menu, Daffodil set. The dishes were in the pictures I attached. The food tasted fantastic. Portion was reasonable. All in all, was a great dinner.
5
We had the cavenous Garden Suite with its welcoming foyer. We were pleasantly surprised by the close personal attention on arrival and throughout dinner. Assistant Manager Gery and service staff Jeffrey were thorough checking the selected menu and offered pre-tasting of the main soup to tweak its taste. Food was served slow at first but caught up well. The young children were thrilled to be led out briefly for ice cream treats. Everyone sought to return at the next occasion
5
This restaurant is one of the best Chinese ones I've ever enjoyed. Jasmine Tea of the finest, a superb fresh food arrangement as well a Garoupa fish was my excellent experience
4
nice ambience, good food, excellent service. service staff very attentive. complimentary desserts of osmanthus jelly n almond biscuits.
5
Staff were very approachable, friendly with excellent service. Good were served with a smile. The staff had specially arranged birthday buns for my mum when they knew that it was a birthday dinner when I made reservation. There was a menu specialised for my table even though I had ordered a set menu with a change of 1 dish.We had enjoyed every bit of all dishes, though the children had wished for more of the sauteed Iberico pork which was simply delicious and full of 'wok fragrance'. When my children did not take the dessert, the staff even took the initiative to offer them alternative which was really a nice gesture greatly appreciated as it made them very happy to get to have something they enjoyed. Overall, it is really a great place to come for excellent food and service

I have been to countless Chinese restaurants in Singapore over 20 years. This year I discovered Summer Pavilion and it is certainly the best Chinese restaurant I have ever visited. A few months ago I had dinner at Fratini La Trattoria which used to be ranked number 1 in tripadvisor and did not understand why. Summer Pavilion is so much better and deserves a higher ranking. I have also eaten at many expensive restaurants in China and I think Summer Pavilion is better than those restaurants.The best thing about this restaurant is that although many dishes on the menu are expensive, I am still able to feed my family of four big eaters for about SGD170. This is fantastic value compared to my dinner at Fratini which costs over SGD200 for 2. We ordered lots of dim sum, hor fun (flat white rice noodles), and chicken which are delicious and filling. I really liked the beef hor fun which is the best I have tasted anywhere. I also like the "Marinated Farm Chicken, Chinese Herbs, Soya Sauce Smoked with Chinese Tea Leaves" very much. I love chicken rice and have eaten at every famous chicken rice stall in Singapore, but this chicken at Summer Pavilion is the best ever. The chef is able to bring out the exquisite fragrance of chicken which is amazing. Half a chicken is very meaty and filling. However I also made the mistake of ordering the stuffed chicken wing and prawn salad which are tiny portions but very expensive. I also wish that the restaurant serves more variety of Hor Fun instead of only beef because their Hor Fun is really good. The restaurant is beautiful and service is excellent and very attentive. However the service staff kept speaking in mandarin to us even though they could hear that my family speaks in English. We are ethnic Chinese but as Singaporeans we grew up speaking in English. I wonder if it is because many service staff are from China. However the service staff treats us like royalty, even though we were dressed very casually just like normal Singaporeans do.I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion, or if you only want to pamper yourself to a good meal
5
Had a wonderful dinner at Summer Pavilion with my family. The dishes were not the typical chinese fare... so exquisite and delicious!!! Not to mention the exceptional service.

I often dine at Summer Pavilion with my family and friends, and we just went for dinner on Father's Day.The fine dining restaurant has a warm welcoming ambience and the food is always exquisitely done. The staff are very attentive and excellent in their recommendations of dishes,The service is great.The new dishes introduced to us were the fish soup with garouper and the "London Duck" that is very juicy.We had it roasted though it comes in their signature style of smoked in tea leaves.Will highly recommend this restaurant for family, with friends or even couples

The roast duck and vegetables with fish stock dishes were exceptionally good- our favourites for this meal. But what made this visit all the more memorable was the outstanding attention to deal paid by the Captain Gery Lee and his team. Two thumbs up for a fine job done!

Cozy environment, friendly staff with smilling face, delicious food to make me visit and visit again for dinner / lunch with my friends and family.

As expected, 5 star chain restaurant, great food, great people. food was great, especially the soup with wrapped abalone (forget what the name is). The restaurant manager (Tall guy, forgot his name) definitely a gem to the company, never fails to deliver prompt service. Overall, this is place is highly recommended for families and friends during weekends

Summer Pavillion has been newly renovated and refurbished with tasteful decor in both main restaurants and private rooms.The cutlery and crockery are very elegant and fine.Service and food is great.I would highly recommend this dining with friends or family

5
The private room was very nicely isolated and interiors were luxurious. Found it suitable for private business dinners. Service was great. Perfect pace of serving dishes and refilling wine glasses. Food quality is not the best in town considering the price but recommendable for formal business dinner with visitors from overseas
5

I had dinner with my friends in Summer Pavilion. The Double-boiled Fish Maw Soup in Coconut, Smoked Duck, Baked Crab Shell and Lobster Poached Rice were superb and tasty. The staff described all the dishes and knew that this all dishes is signature's of Summer Pavilion. Service was very attentive and friendly as usual. The Lychee Oolong Tea from Tea Bone Zen was very fragrance and smooth. All selection of teas are on sell in the restaurant and I have bought for my friend's as a gift. Great place for dinner.
5
Excellent meal. Delicious and not too heavy . Lobster Mee Sua on bed of egg white; 3tier dish w fish, etc all excellent. One of best Chinese meals in a while. Wonderful almond cream
5
After many months of renovation I revisited Summer Pavilion.Service remains excellent.Ambience is enhanced.The dim sum remains as creative as ever, retaining excellent flavours and sight. What is new:(1) Nicer crockery(2) Higher prices
5
Went to the summer pavilion today with my relatives for lunch. We ordered dim sum and some chef recommendation. All the food were great and outstanding. The service staff were great and sleek. Karen, Shu Xian & Chun Wai served us and they are very friendly. It makes the whole dining experience less tense and very relaxing. For me who work in the same industry, I have to say they are very good at what they are doing, double thumbs up
5
Good food, impeccable service. Very attentive to the minor remark we made during the dinner. Food was up to standard in the 6 stars hotel.
4
Was here with my friend. The waitress named Karen & Yoke Pui provided an excellent services. We sure will come back for them. For the food was really nice like beijing duck and one dim sum with chili sauce. Only the hot and sour soup was not really nice... Anyway, we will back again Well done
5
I have been to summer pavilion for years and their first rate service is second to none . Attention to detail and your needs makes your dining experience even more wonderful .They address you by name all the time. They made the effort to decant my wine shortly before our arrival so everything is perfect . Perfect for elegant dining be it for family , friends or corp . I entertained a fair bit and I could not have another that comes close to summer pavilion.Their smoke roasted duck is their and their fish lobster noodle is truly delicate . They are after all Ladies and Gentleman serving Ladies and Gentleman 
4
Stayed at the hotel and had dim sum. What more you want for going to Chinese restaurant?! Overall I love dim sum but it was ok, not as good as what we had on the previous visit but this time we had friendly server with pleasant servings
5
New concept of chinese dining. Unique setting concept.Great food specially the Peking Duck and also the Braised Estuary fish.Great service from the manager Gery keep checking with us on the food. And food that recommend by him were really delicious. Service staff were very friendly. Service was not compromised despite of full capacity. Again another great dining experience with Summer Pavillion
2
Pleasant surroundings, traditional Chinese food, but ridiculously small servings and way overpriced. We ate very similar food the previous night at Man Fu Yuan at the Intercontinental and it was expensive but decent size serves and much better value for money. Don't bother - we won't agai
5
A must go to restaurant if one has a craving for dimsum. Freshly made, served steaming hot and paired with the different types of chinese tea. The fine & smooth porridge loaded with szechuan vegetables and pork was simple but yet so tasty. Satisfies the tummy and so light. Charsiew bun (roasted pork steamed bun) was soft & fluffy & filled with well roasted pork that tasted sweet (in a good way). The dish that one have to try is the fish noodles...made from fresh fish paste and cooked like normal noodles. Swimming in a delectable flavorful broth. A must have!! Many other varieties of dimsum are available.A big mention of the superb service. Staff were able to describe every dish brought to the table. Always attentive always smiling and always making sure each customer was attended to and comfortable. This is truly a 6-star restaurant
5
We booked our family dinner in Summer Pavilion Pine Private Room. The new renovated private room was very grand and beautiful with blue lacquer table, leather chair and a lot of art-pieces hung on the wall. After we all seated and the server presented a bottle of complimentary MoÃ«t & Chandon champagne for us before we start our dinner. This is a special promotion of Summer Pavilion in March & April for those who booked private dining room up to 8 persons and entitle a bottle of free champagne. They always maintain consistency on quality of food & service. My family member are enjoyed the dinner.
5
Food was fabulous. Very interesting pairing of flavours that turned out splendid. Wide array of teas to choose from. I had a chat with the supervisor and mentioned that my girlfriend appreciates tea, and he instantly brought out a few more different samples for tasting. Ritz Carlton continues to lives up to her name in service and hospitality. Definitely value for money in ambience, food, and service. Definitely a place for special occasions and celebration
5
Had a trip to Hong Kong a week ago and had the honor to try the restaurants crowned with 3 Michelin Stars such as Lung King Heen. Although the service is more polished at those establishments, the food at Summer Pavilion left much greater impression.The updated menu since its renovation resonated with my tastebuds especially the sea whelk soup in coconut that is a must try.Given that Michelin is rating Singapore soon, do go to Summer Pavilion for a meal before bookings are hard to get once they're crowned with the Michelin honor
4
Summer Pavilion provides Delicious Food, very excellent service, very nice oriental ambience, a perfect place for dinner
5
We dined here a couple times and was always blown away with their food & Service. There wasn't any need to consider any other venue but here for our Solemnization which was done at their private suite last Saturday to host family and friends. We had such a breeze from booking the venue to all the arrangements to ensure it went smoothly for our special day. everyone was singing praises even till today with them. Excellent service! I have yet to find any other fine dinning chinese here in SG comparable to them. Their Asst Manager Gery is excellent and professional . We cant thank him more as he got all our guest to have memorable experienc

"Is there a special occasion?" the person on the other line asked my husband when he called to reserve a table for two for dinner at Summer Pavilion, located at level 3 at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. These are the "Go that extra mile" attitude that makes Summer Pavilion stands out from the rest of the Chinese restaurants.When we reached the restaurant, we were led to our table in the dimly-lit main dining hall. Our table overlooked the garden outside. The décor is very grand, modern chic and all the tables were lined with white table cloth, brown leather seats, exquisite blue China tableware and all the right utensils. I was carrying a big bag and without hesitation, the waitress brought another chair so that I can place my bag on the chair instead of putting it on the floor. From where I was seated, I could see beautiful black porcelain vases with feather motifs. We were told that the restaurant had undergone a major renovation and reopened only in November 2015.Our dinner voucher entitled us to redeem a "Lily Dinner Set", which is a 5-set dinner, amounting to s$88.00 per person (excludes Chinese Tea). Our waitress recommended a list of specialty tea which sounded "foreign" to us but as we were both down with cough, we asked for something soothing and she recommended a jar of warm water with lemon and honey.We were served yam crisps as a starter while we waited for the food to be served. We looked at the number of cutlery on our table and were baffled as we do not know which set of cutlery to use first. We laughed over our own silliness and lack of knowledge about fine dining. Our first course was "Duo of Prawns" which was very interesting as the prawns were cooked in two different ways. The peeled prawns were served chilled in a glass bowl with rocket leaves, cherries and blueberries while the prawn head and tail were deep-fried. It was an explosion of taste as we could really taste the natural sweetness of the prawns. Next was a bowl of braised bird's nest soup, with lobster meat, bamboo piths and dried asparagus. The broth is so flavourful with generous serving of bird nest. This thick bowl of goodness was exactly what we needed. It was a delightful, comforting soup that perked us up rightaway as we savoured every spoonful of it till the last drop.Our next dish was pan-fried sea perch served on top of green leafy vegetable. The fish was crisp on the outside and yet so juicy on the inside. Next is the braised rice with dried abalone, diced chicken, asparagus and a side dish of green vegetable and mushrooms. It was such a balanced dish and was very flavourful. The serving was just right.For dessert, we had a bowl of mango pudding with pomelo sacs, such a refreshing end to an excellent, delicious meal.Throughout the course of our dinner, we were very impressed by the attentive, courteous and impeccable service of the staff. Our tea-cup was topped up often and the tea pot was re-filled, without any prompting. The waitress also volunteered to take pictures of us as a couple when they saw that I was taking pictures of my husband. However, the dining hall was quite dim for photo-taking. We looked around us and the restaurant was actually doing brisk business. Some of the patrons were regular guests who had eaten in the restaurant before as we could see that they know what to order and were friendly to the staff.When we asked for our bill, we were pleasantly surprised when the friendly manager, Angel, told us that we do not have to pay a cent as the hot water was complimentary. If we had ordered tea or juices, there will be a cost.Besides ala-carte and set menus, Summer Pavilion also serves dim sum lunch daily but reservation is highly recommended to avoid disappointment. We really enjoyed our dinner at Summer Pavilion and agreed that this is a perfect place to bring our bosses and colleagues for a wonderful business lunch. While prices may be on the high-end, we felt that it is worth paying for high quality food and top-notch service and such an excellent dining experience is usually hard to come by
5
Starter: Long bean.Deep fried lobster roll, prawn paste & breaded vermicelli - superb, crispy, light & not oily.Deep fried crab - didn't like the cheesy taste. Otherwise, it was good.Sautéed Chinese cabbage with shredded pork meat in claypot.Smoked duck (half) with Chinese tea leaves - good taste, crispy skin, perfect sauce (not too sweet or saltish).Poached rice, lobster meat.Dry ah balling (black sesame paste inside, served warm) - Super good and not so hot that it will burn your tongue
5
Stayed at the Hotel during this visit to Singapore. Tried out this newly renovated restaurant. The food is comparable if not even better than most Cantonese restaurants in Hong Kong. The double-boiled soup in coconut was fragrant and the lobster poached rice came across as a balanced course that isn't overpowered by the broth and allowed for the freshness of the lobster to shine through.Furthermore, the service was pleasant albeit not without hiccups. The manager, Winnie, who was serving our table that day had trouble explaining to us the courses in English. While we understand that it is an establishment serving Chinese cuisine, the very fact that it is located in a prestigious hotel should mean that the staff should be well-equipped to converse in English. Other than that, the meal was perfect

Chinese New Year (CNY) marks the time when we get to spend more time with family, friends and loved ones. We chose Summer Pavilion after reading online rave reviews and they did not disappoint. My group are all keen lovers of good food and Chinese cuisine. The lychee oolong and seven leaf teas were a great experience! Double boiled chicken soup, smoked chicken with Chinese tea leaf, Taiwanese braised noodles, abalone with Fatt vegetables and addictive chilled peach dessert left us wanting more. The food were well executed, delicious in their own ways and beautifully presented on the Italian tableware that had us swooning often. We would love to bring them home. A picture says a thousand words and I hope you love the pictures as much as we do.Apart of the luxe, private dining room setting that feels so warm like home, it's the attending service team that really enhances the dining experience. Our much thanks to Mr Gery Lee and Ms Pei Xian for their attentive, warm service, enthusiasm and the constant attention to details. As entrepreneurs, we know that a happy team is key to going the extra mile for their workplace and with pride and we saw it here. A great evening! Looking forward to more dining experience here

First time visited the restaurant after their renovation.It is not typical Chinese restaurant, Setup and the decoration was like western fine dining especially the uniform outlook.We were seated in the main dining hall. Ordered a mixture of Dim Sum and also some Chinese cuisine that goes with the rice.Dim Sum was great and cook to perfection. Especially like the Dumpling in soup with a small whole abalone. The 'lobster shaghainess dumpling' is a bit disappointing, which we expect a bigger size due the the price. Pan-fried wagyu was excellent the meat melt in your mouth within seconds. Cod with hoi sin sauce is a must tried item. Our favourite dish is their special 'braised estuary fish' my dad had 2 bowl of rice with this dishes.Special thanks to Jeffy that explain all the dishes and entertain us with our lunch. Great service from him and the team
5
We have chinese new year lunch here, and although they were short on staff, and extremely busy, service was excellent, and the food quality was very top notch ! They even bothered to go through the whole process of Yu Sheng one by one 
4
It was a good dinner. The service provided by the service staff was good. Since it was my mother's birthday they have prepared a special arrangement which we very much appreciated.
5
We recently had a wonderful time dining at Summer Pavilion. The restaurant has received a complete renovation and the new room is quite beautiful. The food is top notch - love the hot and sour soup, along with really tasty sweet and sour pork. Ambience is refined, service gracious and food great. What's not to like
5
Hands down the best chinese restaurant in singapore. Have been living here for 21 years and nothing comes close. The dim sum here is on another level. Very attentive staff and great ambiance, it can't be missed. Seriously.
5
Food in Summer Pavillion has never failed to impress. Service gets a 10/10 and food arrives at a perfect pace. The DimSum was fried to perfection. The 小笼包's soup was amazing, it brought out the true taste of lobster. Overall dishes were good and tasty. Desserts were refreshing, perfect after having a meal. My visit here has left a lasting impression of me and I will definitely return here for more
5
Once again, Summer Pavilion has lived up to its excellent reputation. The menu has some refreshing change, and the food and service remains tip top. Summer Pavilion is fortunate to have excellent staff team such as Captain Ms Karen Ho and Ms Yoke Pui. They make the guests feel at ease and comfortable. The new decoration and changes I must admit is a great improvement from the past. The Tim Sum is perfect, not greasy and delicious. The lobster roll （千丝龙虾卷）is my all time favorite. The price may be on the high end but is definitely worth it. I have patronized the restaurant since the 90s, it remains as the top Chinese restaurant for me in Singapore.
5
We stayed in the hotel and decided to relax that day hence checking out what's there for lunch. We didn't expect much but was astonished at how delicious our lunch was. Desserts were amazing too - gui hua gao. I say, this restaurant serves better Cantonese cuisine than Hong Kong
4
The atmosphere as very good ,the food as alright ,but definately not worth the money ! The coconut soup was great though! It's worth the tr
5
Having been overseas for the last month, couldn't wait to come back and satisfy my cravings for good Cantonese cuisine and I wasn't disappointed.The food was fresh and executed to perfection. Chef Kong interacted with us and explained the inspirations behind the dishes we order which we found to be really engaging and something that restaurants should aspire to achieve. As a culinary experience should beyond just the taste.Kudos to Chef Kong and his team
5
Second time dinning at Summer Pavilion and it was a wonderful experience. First time was back in 2008, it didnt really left a mark. There is a marked improvement after the change in executive chef.‌Chef Kong is a master at Cantonese cuisine. I have had my fair share of Cantonese food in China, Hong Kong and US. I have to say the offerings are top notch. They just reopen their restaurant after a major renovation, but the gold here is the food. ‌Star of the night was definitely Steamed Crab Meat Dumpling with Chicken and Hairy Crab Roe. It was extremely well prepared and the flavor was delicate and well balanced.‌Strongly recommend this establishment if you are looking for good Cantonese cuisine with a slight modern interpretation
5
Great updated decor, great service n they serve dim sum lunches on the weekends which was also very good.Very high standards and the Chinese Cantonese style cooking restaurant has no MSG in food and no sharks fin policy
5
The service the setting the food.. All amazing. The staff are clearly well trained and give 6* of service. The setting is stunning and when you eat here you will fall in love with the crockery.. I want to buy them!!! We had the BBQ combination which was great but what I liked most were the dim sum dishes like the prawn and pork dumplings, the rice skin chicken noodle thing... The har gau and a lobster xiao lom bao (I do think these are better in din tai fong though). The tea was also exquisite and worth a mention. I was shocked when they said no ti kwan yin, but went with another choice for the hell of it. We had a jasmine green and a lychee oolong both unique yet fantastic. If you love lychee then go for the lychee oolong since it's very lychee. We booked in advance and I strongly recommend you do since it's busy at the weekends.. Price for 2 is around 100-150 sing so it's not cheap dim sum but it's great and I'll certainly return. Perfect for families couples and also for special events like birthdays. You must come her
5
I was staying at ritz and visited this restaurant for dinner one night. It was phenomenal ! The food was flavourful and the staff was very hospitable. This place is definitely not cheap though. But I feel their prices are worthwhile considering the ambience and food offered by them
5
Excellent food and service from staff. Smoked duck is the best I have eaten. Highly recommended place for even lunch not only dinner. Personalised service by Ms Winnie Lim is excellent!
5
Great food with great friendly services. The ambient is perfect for fellowships. The staff are knowledgeable & know their food
5
Had a really good dimsum lunch with my family. We enjoyed the food and the impecable service rendered. Price was reasonable too. A highly recommended eat!
5
Hard to find such a great setting for an pleasant afternoon Dim sum .. Quality of food is refined and service is attentive .. Been here for last 4 years .. Never fail me each time ... Consistent standard in service , good refine food and great ambience .. Keep it up ...
5
We had been looking forward to revisiting this old Favourite after not having been for at least a couple of years and after today's meal its fast becoming a new and firm favourite. The service is just wonderful and we recognised a few familiar faces. The best sellers were still on the dim sum menu like the lobster rolls and pork buns which tasted better than I remembered. We also tried the rice rolls with xo sauce and diced beef in taro baskets - both were also excellent. And we had to order the crispy noodle with egg gravy and garouper. Another winning dish. No room for dessert this time but we are already booked in for Sunday! Loving the fresh and contemporary new look of the dining room. I'm tempted to make a standing reservation every weekend
5
I had luncheon with my friends on Tuesday. This is our very first visit to Summer Pavilion after its newly renovation. The environment and ambient was good. The staff service was awesome too, they very attentive and friendly, especially a captain name Coco, she did a really great job. We were well taken care of by her most genuine service. Thanks ! Amazing dining experience.
5
Staffs very attentive and provided excellent service for my family. Food was tasty and very unique presentation. Highly recommended..!!!
5
Having eaten at 2 top places over last two days, this restaurant got me back to memories from Chinese restaurants in China. They offered sophisticated dishes but without losing anything of true Chinese tastes, as I remember them. Great service!
5
It is a lovely trip to this wonderful restaurant with great service. My family and I enjoyed the meal tremendously, not only for the great ambience and delicious dishes, we are also very impressed with the impeccable service by assistant manager Angel Pann, captain Ong Hui Ling and their staff.
5
The foods are very delicious & tasted superb especially one of the Restaurants' Signature Dishes poached Rice with Lobster. The staff are very friendly disposition
