Pros: Great Food! Great Staff! Lots of Variety.
Cons: Same music everyday - you could set your watch to it! :-)

1-for-1 dinner, not much variety for hot dishes, overall was acceptable. The restaurant was not full, it was comfortable to have dinner there. The Laksa was great, the best among hotel buffets, must try! Hubby said the durian paste was tasty too!
4
We are vegans and gluten free and the team got to work to meet our needs even though the menu had very little to offer us.
4
As we stayed at the Hotel we had breakfast, was open 06:00 to 11:00 for breakfast. Great buffet breakfast with a great choice from local dim sum, to continental.
5
Awesome selection of food that caters for any palate and the price is not too expensive. We will eat here again
4
good selection with everything covered - dim sum, japanese, local, continental etc. Especially loved muesli bread.
4
Three of us had the dinner buffet and we had our fill of our local delights. The laksa is very good. They also had kueh pei tee and our all time favourite - durian pudding. Itâ€™s a great buffet to load up on the our local favourites. They also have senior discounts for local. So, enjoy!
4
Fusion fare at promotional rates on Mondays and Wednesdays and specials for Pioneers and Senior citizens on other days. Good spread of food and desserts including traditional snacks for diners to savour. So far quality of buffet meals are much better than other buffet restaurants. Worth a try
1
I can only say is a disappointed dinning experience. limited selection on dishes. Tried the fried carrot cake, it's tasteless. For dessert, the rainbow kueh lapis is worse than those sell in the cakeshop. For this price, you can go other places that much more better..Will never go again
4
Saw the ad in a foodie mag and we booked for 10 to tryout this Peranakan Buffet. We sort of expected it to be packed but it was very leisurely and peaceful - mainly retirees as there is a special pricing for senior citizens ($36+++) and even better for pioneer citizens ($31+++). Regular pricing is $46+++.For that price you cannot have everything but everything we wanted was available. Cooked on the spot laksa, mee rebus, fried mee sua.
4
Our family love coming to this place for buffet. The selection is local yet with nice Sashimi and seafood. Service is efficient as well.
5
We had breakfast here and were delighted at so many choices. Food was good quality, plenty of it, many asian and western choices. Everything from cornflakes to spring rolls!

Feast @ East Buffet Restaurant is having "Penang Delights" spread - not halal. Reserved a table for old friends re-union. Restaurant very crowded on our arrival at noon. Nice Peranakan / cosy set up. Met by JoJo (manager): "50 % discount promotion today. " Sumptuous spread of Penang food, desserts/ fruits. Cold : Salmon/tuna/(cooked) octopus (served) , big prawn, mussel. Cooked: Laksa (soup) / Fried chicken (served) , curry chicken, beef rendang, chili prawns (big) / fish, stew pork / lamb (nice), Babi Ponteh (nice but fatty), nonya mix vegetables, kiam chye soup etc. DIY: cendol, rojak (green mango, cucumber, jumbo, turnip, pineapple, fried tofu etc. ), kueh pie tee. Deserts: Durian pengat/cake (our favorites), ice creams (6 flavours) fruits (water melon, melon, orange), nonya kuehs, Service wise, staff were friendly and efficient as they cleared the used plates and utensils regularly/fast. Food finished fast (full house) and were replenished frequently . Good service and value for money. Durian pengat is excellent - one of the best in Singapore. Missed the Babi Buah Keluak (alternate with Babi Ponteh) and fried (alternate with soup ) laksa . Feedback to Roxy: Best if can include satays, kambing soup, samosa , nangka. We loved the food and enjoyed ourselves
2
No doubt the high tea buffet price per head is relatively cheap compared with other restaurants, it's absolutely not worth at all. Peranakan buffet but the variety of Nonya dishes were so pathetic, and they seemed like they were left over from lunch. Definitely will not go back.
4
The buffet lunch or dinner is always good. My menu starter is raw fish of salmon & tuna. Followed by Durian Cake & Durian Puree with attap seed fruits. Next will be cakes, cheese, Cold Fresh Prawns, laksa, chendol, ice cream & Boncafe grinded coffee. The main food that I will eat is Laksa. The rest of the food is available everywhere. Hence, I can afford to skip them.What I have learnt is to eat food that is hard to prepare & cook and time consuming to perare/cook
3
Made reservation for the two-for-one lunch promotion at $46++ on Monday and was shocked at the quality of the food since my last visit a couple of years ago. Except for the Signature laksa and durian paste dessert, all the other dishes had lost their flavor and variety. The curries were flat and watery, the samosa fried a long time ago and lost its crispness, even the mixed white and brown rice unappetizing. There was sashimi but again without flavor, ditto the cold large prawns. The nyonya kueh were not only violently colored but tough and chewy though the durian cake topped with raspberries was more palatable. Seriously wondered what had happened, no sign of the popiah or mee siam praised by earlier reviews! Did the management reduce the variety and quality just because it's a two for the price of one deal? Seriously, the cup of coffee from the machine was the most predictable and enjoyable item. Couldn't fault the service though, courteous and efficient, water readily served, such a pity we won't risk disappointment again. Wouldn't dare bring any foreign guests to savour Peranakan food here

It has been quite some time (to be exact 3 years) since our last visit here (though I had reviewed this place then in another well known local food forum) and good to revisit it.In celebration of May Day holiday, my family came here for its buffet lunch. Located on the 3rd storey of Grand Mercure Roxy Hotel, both the hotel and cafe have undergone renovation works and now they are more spacious, cosy, bright and neat!As we had made advance reservation, we were ushered to our table promptly by the polite staff. It was a while later, when the cafe was almost full! Nice and lovely ambience, bright. There was also a setup makeshift booth where one could buy some Peranakan snacks, costumes and even shoes.The cafe was well known for its authentic Peranakan (Nonya) food and true enough the dishes there were nice and yummy. The spread was quite extensive (they also offer sashimi and salad bar but no sushi though supposedly to be Nonya food).We had tried almost every dish that was available and among them, we liked the following best - Popiah (hand wrapped spring roll), very nice and wonderful; Curry Chicken - not overly powered by coconut milk, fragrant and thick gravy; Lamp Chop - well marinated and nice; Nonya Chap Chye - mixed stir fried vegetables, nice; Beef Rendang - well marinated and great flavour; Sweet and Sour Fish - nice combination of the sauces and fish was fresh and well deep fried; Durian Penget/Nonya Kueh - very flavourful, rich in taste etc.They also have live cooking station, where you can order the traditional Laksa (I think the gravy a bit too watery and not thick enough) and fried Laksa (instead of putting the noodles in gravy, they were stir fried instead, innovative and creative, resembling the Hokkien Fried Noodles but without prawns). We would love to see other noodle items as these 2 were repetitive. They can consider replacing one with Mee Siam or Mee Reebus instead.There were also fresh seafood, like prawns, mussels etc, and they were fresh. Of course, there were dessert (ice kachang and black glutinous rice), ice cream and fruit stations.What was interesting was that they had some snacks, sweets and candies of the 60s and 70s in containers and diners could help themselves with them.Coffee and Tea were self serviced with machines located towards the end of the other side of the cafe (iced water were refilled by staff). Perhaps due to great turn out of diners with high demand of such beverages, the 2 coffee machines took turn to "malfunction" due to the lack of milk or spiller overflowed where staff would need to come to clear them, reset before they could dispense the drinks again. From time to time, I have noticed that the queuing diners were signaling to the staff to attend to the machines.Service wise. Overall, staff were friendly and quite efficient as they cleared the used plates and utensils quite regularly. Maybe due to the fact that the cafe was almost full house, staff were seen "stretching themselves" serving from table to table, clearing plates, or refilling water and doing the ushering, clearing the table, maybe more staff could be allocated during the peak period. Only saw 3-4 staff, excluding 1-2 supervisors, manning the over hundred diners! The guest chef, Madam Jane, a Peranakan herself in her traditional costume was seen walking around, chatting with diners and also supervising the chefs from time to time.And it was good value for money considering if you like Peranakan food, that are authentic and traditional and most importantly yummy! Overall, we enjoyed our meal here and were very satisfied with the food, service and ambience. We will revisit again soon, possibly trying the dinner in our next visit

Value for money buffet dinner! Good selection of cooked food, there's also sashimi n fresh oysters. My toddler loved the congee fr the 'live' station. And the durian pengat is one of the nicer ones we had. Staffs were very friendly n attentive. The table placemat was interesting, printed like a newspaper headline & my 7yo was reading it while my toddler went on to doodle with the pen i brought with me. Would be great if they can offer some colour pencils & the kids will have drawing activities using the placemat :)
5
The resto is one of my family's favourite to go for buffet. What I like about Feast@East is the excellent service - staff are friendly and they clear your table as quickly as they can. Very good selection of food for the modest price.As I'm a Accor Plus member, I get good discount. So it was good.Special mention goes to Ann who took time to interact with us while performing her cashiering duties and the restaurant manager (didn't manage to get his name) who helped to clear our tables a few times, and offered to help us take a family pic - very on the ground which explains the 5* service standards.
4
Not so many buffets in this area of town. Buffet has seafood, roasts and a selection of international dishes. Desserts were very nice and a nice ice-cream bar that you can help yourself to. Price is around $65 per person. The food/selection is not quite as high quality as 5 star restaurants in the city but is still very nice and far better than eating at the shopping centre over the road. Service was attentive and cold water was given along with complimentary iced tea and a selection of coffee and tea. Would definitely go here again
4
Great comprehensive restaurant catering for a wide range of cultures. Breakfast their speciality. Chef on hand cooking.
5
Gorgeous food, they think of everything here. The chef makes a great omelette. They had indian, japanese, western...all kinds of stuff. A veritable feast!
5
Excellent food and sevics, if you enjoy local Singapore Cuisine. Reasonable prices, good value for money.
4
Very good breakfast. Just enough choices to jumpstart your day in Singapore and for one not to over-eat - from fresh eggs cooked the way you want it, bacon, sausages, noodles, soup, various viands, breads, butter and jams, freshly brewed coffee, fresh fruits and juices, and many more
3
Affordable buffett dinner with a wide spread, they have a spread of Peranakan dishes like babi ponteh,etc besides the usual Christmas roast beef and ham. There is also laksa which was not the best laksa. Dessert spread was good,all kinds of cakes also peranakan cakes,chendol,ice kachang, kueh kueh.The chilli crab was good
4
though not in posh hotel feast @ east is an ideal place with family over a weekend.We used to have lunch for the perankan and some of their asian dishes.The durian pengat is best with thick durian and not too sweet.Another outstanding dish is the crab beehoon very delicious.The place is spacious and clean.I must say is an ideal place which offer a good service and delicious food.Worth the money if you like local delights and even they have sashimi and few live stations.Finally thanks JoJo for his excellent service. 
3
Now I must say feast at east offers the best competitive buffet rates in Singapore. The spread of food is commendable. What I sincerely feel is that certain qualitative food preparation MUST be adhered to. Quantity wise they have everything that a diner expects. However the preparation of the food is generally not consistent. Put more effort into this area and I am certain this joint will be a hit. For your information I dine here every week without fail
5
A great dining place that offers local delights at an affordable price. We love the durian purÃ©e, the fresh salmon sashimi and the laksa. Thank You Zul for the kind arrangement. The gesture is deeply appreciated. The restaurant is always fully booked, do reserve your table early to avoid any disappointment.
5
The Laksa is the best I've ever tasted. The prawns, mussels and salmon were superb. In fact the entire buffet was great with a wide variety of dishes to suit all tastes and cultures. I was impressed that dishes were still being refilled close to closing time. It was nice to be remembered by some of the wait staff, all of whom were extremely attentive. This is a great value for money buffet restaurant with excellent quality food. We will eat here again during our stay in our favourite city
5
An excellent restaurant. The buffet is particularly lovely, with a wide variety of interesting and high quality dishes. My particular favourites are the sashimi and the desserts. Today I had lime ice cream with durian paste, pineapple tarts and bread and butter pudding. This restaurant also does themed days which afford interesting cultural insights into South East Asian cuisine.Deserving of particular commendation are chef Eric, and staff Jojo and Kelvin, but all staff are outstanding.For a great dining experience which isn't too pricey, this restaurant is highly recommended
5
Very clean , spacious and well laid out place to dine with a variety of fruits , vegetables grained and staple that is just amazing
4
I had breakfast here for 3 days and enjoyed the variation in hot dishes as well as the wonderful variety of choice for breakfast. Really great value!
5
Great Breakfast spot. Great Range & good value. Open early if your need to get to the city & very welcoming staff
4
This month is Peranakan Buffet and found the durians heavenly yummy, laksa quite shiok, Assam veg curry and fried rice an spicy and worthy of second serving. The Korean waitress and Indian waiter are efficient and friendly.
4
The breakfast here is good.A good selection of Indian western and Chinese. The food is tasty.The service is good.
4
I stumbled on this venue for afternoon tea buffet by chance.For S$25( excluding tax) , you can enjoy unlimited laksa , mee rubus, porridge , pork ball soup, a variety of nonya kueh, ching tng, ice cream etc , free flow of coffee and tea. The laksa was exceptional - for that alone, it was worth it.The interesting Peranakan decor items and the touches of nostalgia makes this a pleasant Saturday afternoon.

Saw an advertisement on feast & east buffet, they have special for senior and pioneer. Price for lunch $44++ senior $35 nett pioneer $30.nettI thought it was good gesture of them to have special for our senior and pioneer. To my surprise they even have special for labour day $29 nett.( 1/5/16) thank you guys for working on labour so we can enjoy lunch.So I make a booking for two and was there at 12.35 pm it was so crowded the crowd was rushing as though food is running out quite an unpleasant scene and they were so noisy, is this Singaporean behaviour ? , The buffet was only starting surely if each and everyone slowly quietly enjoy the fair it will be beautiful. The waitress told me they have a full house. But they did not turn away walk in they even open other station to meet the crowd that was very thoughtful and flexible move. The food was not bad for the price we pay, not fantastic but acceptable. Unlike what I read on the hungry go where the review I read was quite negative. There was a lady in kebaya I spoke to she told me she is the food consultant (a peranakan lady I think is nancy ) was sitting around watching the crowd enjoying her recipe.All waitress dress in kebaya, and they were friendly though some don't understand us when we talk to them.The table mat was beautiful. Over all lunch is good we order a bottle of red wine was enjoying it eating slowly tasting all the kueh. It was our wedding anniversary
4
The salmon sashimi was excellent and the tuna the bast I have had in years, and all cut correctly. The pork rib soup was terrific. Beef roast and gravy perfect, a good cut used. All the food was good, but as per a previous reviewer we found the crabs disappointing and not that nice. However it didn't stop one family from sending their maid to load the plates with crab. Deserts were excellent, and the cakes a treat. Thoroughly enjoyed the apple crumble and custard, traditional cooking.the service was excellent with no accumulating of plates, and the smile of the waiter Vishwankar much appreciated, and reflected the service throughout the hotel. I had defined a Buffet as always promising so much but delivering less, but in this Buffet it surpassed my expectation and I would rank it only just behind the old Hyatt Buffet. Would definitely visit again, very good value too
4
Our second visit to this beautiful place and our fourth stay at the hotel. The buffet did not disappoint this time either! Was a very very busy Saturday night and the food was turned over regularly which was great. Really nice variety and the staff were lovely! Made ourselves sick full again but that's what I think buffets are for!! A wonderful place to eat :
4
First time we have eaten here and went on a friend's recommendation. The Feast@East buffet restaurant was having a Singapore heritage menu in March/April and we went with our friends to try it out. To be honest, our expectations were not too high but after walking around the food area we were raring to go.There were just too many dishes to sample and describe so let us just say that we were very satisfied with our choices. A special mention should go to the ice shaving machine which allowed me to make my own ice kacang, my way. The addition of durian paste, extra coconut milk, some coconut ice cream and more than the usual number of atapchee made a dessert to remember - perhaps a touch more cendol than ice kacang, but the ice shavings were a bit too slushy for the real thing. Certainly made my day!In addition, we went on a Wednesday and there was a 50% discount in operation. No idea how often they have deals like that
4
good quality buffet, but unless you have a large capacity to eat, then to me it was expensive, although as i said food quality was excellant
4
We love the breakfast buffet and there is a lot of variety of Asian and western food and we enjoy the food very much. Kids like the coconut ice cream very much..
4
A wide variety of breakfast items for all nationalities, well laid out and good attentive staff. Could do with mugs for the coffee instead of small cups, would half the amount of times you go up for coffee!
3
There is a good buffet spread for breakfast, although in recent years I've noticed the selection getting smaller. Having said that, you can still get freshly made eggs and a variety of eastern and western dishes. The service is always polite and willing.
2
Coming down at 9:30am for breakfast proved to be a wrong move as it was chaotic. Dishes were refilled only intermittently and staff were overwhelmed. Thank goodness for the egg station for saving the day!
4
Efficient friendly staff and very good food. Menu of hot food changes daily and they also had plenty of condiments and sauces. Good selection of buffet goodies, breads, muffins etc.
4
I stayed at Grand Mercure Roxy and got the 30% discount coupon with my stay. The price is reasonable. The variety is not huge but I could have all the Singaporean dishes that I craved for. I like the peranakan section as well as the noodles and carrot cake sections. I had been missing the Singaporean dishes so it's a great chance for me to have a nib of this and that. The seafood section is limited. It was just limited to scallop, crab and prawn but all is in good quality. It would be nicer if they could offer more Singaporean dishes and less of the tired looking cold salad / appetizers
4
Whilst visiting friends in Singapore, I have visited this restaurant on many occasions (often three times per week). The food is very good indeed and many dishes are quite spectacular. This top quality is not always consistent, and it is possible to find dishes which are mediocre, but the variety of dishes available in the buffet makes these blips less of a problem. Coming from UK this place is heaven. For example, on an evening there could be oysters au gratin, sashimi, char kway cheow, soups, salads, fruits and ice cream, bread and butter pudding, durian etc etc. Can't complain!They do interesting local dishes, and have themed buffets which are beautifully presented. The staff are delightful and Kelvin, Geraldine, and Eric deserve special mention. The waiting staff are also incredibly conscientious and efficient. I recommend this restaurant unreservedly for value for money, for high quality of the food, and for friendly and highly professional staff
4
very good food!. What I love most was:the - laksa- ice cream- fresh oysters/sashimi/prawns/scallops and sweet meat crabs- ice kacang! (yes you have the traditional machine to DIY)- kacang puteh! (so retro)- durrrrrrrrrrrian paste was sinfully delightful... best with coconut ice cream- pineapple rice was mmmmmm slurp!- oneh onehI thought the following can be improve though:- the soup noodle which taste a bit off flavor.- the bigger crabs that needs a nut cracker to crack open. I like the smaller crabs that I can just break open with my teeth and the meet is sweeter in taste. when they change to bigger crabs, I need to call for a cracker and the meat is less sweet with more ammonia taste in it.anyway, I will go back agai
5
This is the restaurant of Gran Roxy Mercure Hotel in Singapore.I tried this restaurant three times while I stayed in Hotel Mercure.The food and beverage are amazing in my opinion!They serve food at buffet: there is a large variety of disches from traditional Far-East Countries, especially Thai and Indonesia.Every time I tried the restaurant the food at buffet was different and this surprised me positively
5
There was a very wide selection of choices and all was good. Western food and Asian food were available. I especially enjoyed the parata with Dahl.
5
Excellent food choices and variety. Service a little slow to remove used plates but still a good overall experience.
4
Great western and ethic daily buffets breakfast, lunch bad dinner.. Complimentary guest access when you book a room.
4
Had breakfast on two consecutive days here and the menu was different on both days. There is a vast spread of bread selection and the chef also turns your request for special orders quickly.
4
Saturday High Tea is value for money and really good food. Watch out for the durian cake and Katong Laksa.
3
Food was good. Dessert options are great. More salad would be a bonus. Coffee machines not always in working order.
4
Nice way to sample the culture, staff are very keen to explain dishes.
Wednesday night is reduced price!!
4
Standard fare offered. Nothing fancy but gets you there. The staff is fast and responsible. There is a cheerfulness around them.
3
Lots of pork dishes - go for it if you are keen on eating pork. Other dishes are more or less the same - laksa, cold prawns, salad, meat dishes. This time, no oysters are seen. Seems there's a SG50 promotion for senior citizens age 55 and above but you need to show your NRIC as evidence of your age to qualify for this discount
4
This buffet had everything you needed from cottage pie to pancakes and more. The food was hot and if it was cooked it was cooked perfectly. I would certainly return to feast@east and I would return to the hotel it is in. I would certainly recommend this buffet to people who have businesses out in Singapore
4
Great restaurant for breakfast. Stayed here a week. Good range. Avoid the seafood buffet dinner. Waste of money. No range and we waited for ages for food to be replaced. Empty plates on buffet table with minimal dining guests is very poor service.
5
So much to choose from, hot and fresh and everything was full! Nothing ran out and the food was constantly coming out. I loved the laksa bar too! YUM! We left the restaurant feeling super full! Worth every bit of weight I put on!! Would love to have had this again
4
The Feast@East is a really good buffet restaurant belonging the the Grand Mercure Roxy Hotel in Singapore and situated on the 3rd floor.We had an early meal there on the evening of our departure. The buffet opened at 6pm, so everything was really fresh and the restaurant not over crowded. There was nothing to fault in this buffet restaurant.The choices of food was great from cold starters including crab, prawns, clams, sashimi dishes, salads, etc. Soups, noodles and a great variety of main dishes many of which were new to us and typical of the region.What we particularly liked was the way that the buffet chefs were more than happy to come round and explain to you what all the different dishes on offer consisted of and how they were prepared. This will probably not happen once the restaurant gets busy.We tried just a little of quite a lot of them and apart from one or two, really enjoyed them! There was also a good selection of desserts to choose from.We received a special midweek seniors’ promotion rate of 34 Singapore Dollars per person and that included taxes and the service charge!Wine is not cheap anywhere in Singapore so if you like it, this will definitely add to your final bill but the restaurant did have a reasonably priced house wine.The hotel had different offers on different nights of the week so it’s well worth checking it out before booking.Table service was excellent with great attention to detail.Easy one to recommend
4
This will be our 6th or 7th time at this hotel. Always excellent. Feast @ East buffet food offers great selection. Good value for Accor members. Laksa though has not so many ingredients as previous. Maybe cutting back for cost reasons. Breakfast bacon toooooooo crispy. Maybe offer not so well cooked as well. Otherwise very good, very similar each day, which can become a little boring if you stay several days and eat in
4
The buffet spread at Feast @ East Buffet Restaurant is considered very good by the 'Easternites'. The ambience of the restaurant is cosy and very family friendly. The buffet spread is mostly international. They are well known for the durian paste desert so you must sample this delicacy if you happen to visit the restaurant. What we like about the restaurant is they do provide a good discount for the elderly. Do call up the hotel before you visit just to make sure that the discount for the elderly is available. This is because on special occasion and festive seasons, the elderly discount is usually not available. However, if you do visit, you must sample the herbal soups, laksa, sashimi and other kinds of sea food. You will be treated to a good desert spread as well. On the several occasions that we visited, we found the service rather good so this is a bonus
3
Buffet choice was Good...have different food choice on the 2 days there. the chef at the egg's station was chitty & friendly. Layout is good, replenish of food was quick. But: Coffee / Tea station - short of teaspoons ???Staff: works like a "robot" No smile & requests go unanswered and no eye contacts.Infant chair: dirty & oily - need to check & clean up after every used. Even , staff clean it with a half hearted ...holiday mood ? maybe.... ;
4
Good spread. A large variety of fruits, beverages and baked products in the breakfast. The live counter for egg dishes and pancakes/ waffles serves fresh dishes. Not sure about sea food since I'm a vegetarian. I would like to see few more vegetarian dishes in the menu, although by no means they are short of variety
5
I think this place has many great dishes for a great price. Come hungry, because there are so many food delights here from a mix of regions in this buffet style restaurant on the third floor of the Roxy Mercure Hotel. The cheese with apricots and walnuts is special. They will custom make your omelette and one morning, I even had a salad with bacon and fried egg on top. One morning when I ate here I refilled my cappuccino at the three machines there multiple times and just chilled out by my window seat and felt totally relaxed without a care in the world. The various breads and pastries are fresh and tasty and keep loved ones happy for the day. The servers here are not as attentive as they could be but if you befriend one, they step up to the plate. Great breakfast and brunch here to get you stoked for the day
4
Have my family dine in this place,not my first or last.Because the food and service standard have improve alots.There's wide range of every course of food and dessert.One thing I like about this restaurant,is the sashimi and oysters,they serve you fresh,not display there waiting for you.Although that day is a weekend,very crowded,the staffs are quick in clearing and even refill your half empty glass.Though paying $58++ per pax for xmas peranakan buffet is abit expensive,but is worth filling your stomach
4
A very nice and cozy cafe at The Grand Mercure Roxy Hotel serving Singaporean and Peranakan cuisine served Buffet style. The Appetizer cold dishes section includes yummy chilled crabs (that takes a bit of work with a nut cracker to get the juicy crab meat out from the hard shell of the mud crabs, but worth the effort), Scallop on the shell (the real stuff and not fake processed seafood usually served at some restaurant), Tiger prawns and Mussels too ...a wide variety of salad and dressings ...both Chinese and Western soups are available with choice of bread (would be lovely if they have freshly baked breads like French Baguette or rolls to go with the soup). There is a Sashimi counter too for Japanese foodies. The Peranankan section has Crabs cooked in minced Buah Keluak (Candle nut), Babi Ponteh, almost all the popular classic Nonya dishes.Since it is the Christmas festive season, they have a section where you can have your fill of Roast Turkey, Baked honey glazed Ham and roasted Pork Loin with crispy delicious skin. For dessert, it was a difficult decision on whether to have log cakes, brownies, cheese cake, custard caramel or the so many selection of Nonya Kueh Kueh (Peranakan dessert) ...sample all if you are a true foodie and finish the meal with bowl of Durian Mousse (King of Fruits in SEA). We enjoyed dining at this buffet restaurant because of the wide choice of dishes, plus there is a senior citizen discount
4
I enjoy the cultural themes they use- get to try many different types of food! Service is great, food fresh and plentiful and attractively presented!
4
Sets the tone for the day. Very efficient service. Good spread and variety of choices available for both vegetarians and those who love continental as well as S-E Asia cuisine.
5
The breakfast was superb at the Feast@East Buffet Restaurant offering everything you can think of from Asian and Western cuisines and all deliciously fresh and cooked on the spot. They even catered for our dietary request (non-dairy). The staff were very friendly, attentive and helpful especially Faran. Faran and the Chef surprised us by organising a freshly cooked (non-dairy) birthday pancake stack decorated with fruit and maple syrup for my husband’s birthday. What wonderful service! What a wonderful start to the day for us, especially my husband. We were so surprised and very, very, appreciative. Thank you to Faran, the Chef and all the staff at Feast@East Buffet Restaurant
5
Liked the range of food available. There were Asian and European options available and there was a chef who was happy to cook eggs and omelettes on demand. A number of the staff were very helpful and pleasantDisliked the coffee machines which tended to malfunctio
5
We thought we would actully eat in for one night and try the Peranakan Hotel Buffet, There was a huge selection of food available - including Singapore Laksa and Durian cake with Durian paste. As they say, durian is a taste that is liked - or not. We found it to be very good. We naturally couldn't try everything on offer but certainly gave it a good try. Very quick clearing of tables after each delicious dish made the evening very pleasant
4
I'm a nine year old boy from England and I stayed at the Roxy mercure for four nights and we ate breakfast at the feast@east every morning. the variety of different foods was really good and they changed it every morning. there was things from all over the globe and everyone got what they wanted
3
This was my first time dinning at Feast @ East Buffet Restaurant. We went for the lunch buffet which starts from 1200hrs to 1430hrs. Both my friend and I were starved when we got there as we wanted to try whatever that was lined up for us. Upon arriving at the restaurant, we had to figure out where the front of house were as we went up by the lift. This place had 2 entrances, so we saunter in hoping that someone would attend to us. The staff at the restaurant were attentive and alert! They noticed us quickly and seated us at our table. We were quickly served our drinks which were a can of YEO's birds nest and a cup of plain water. Tea and coffee were self service. The restaurant was a medium sized place with a traditional Peranakan feel to it.There were only 3 main islands to choose from. The ‘live’ cooking station was serving Singapore Laksa and Beef noodles that day. Out of the two, I gotta to say our favourite and it's definitely a MUST try is the Singapore Laksa!! The Singapore Laksa coconut milk based gravy was thick and tasty, makes your mouth water and wanting more. At that same island, there was also fresh salmon Sashimi a great appititzer to start off your meal. An the middle island are the mains, there were a variety of cold salads (mushroom salad, traditional Thai papaya salad and coleslaw), nasi bryani with either fried chicken or fried fish, beef rendang, seafood (prawns and mussels), kueh pai ti, soups (bak kut teh & pumpkin) and many more other local dishes. Lastly the dessert island, Feast@East's Durian Paste is a MUST try! It will definitely find favour among durian lovers. There's also ice-cream, varieties of cakes and also some Peranakan kueh kuehs :) What I liked about the dessert island was the huge variety of local fruits. Overall, I had a pleasant time checking out Feast@East and there's definitely room for improvement. They could look at putting a front of house via the lift entrance so as to greet their guest. They could also look at having a selection of fresh salads as there wasn't any and the interval of topping up the popular dishes as they tend to run out really fast. The positives of the place were that the staff were attentive and friendly and they did have a good variety of local food

In my entire life I have never ever been to eat at such an awful place! They charge $44 per person and advertised a delicious array of seafood and fine Singapore dishes. Boy is that false advertising. The so called seafood included prawns and mussels. We sat for an hour and the only dish there in seafood was the mussels....the same dish with hardly anyone touching. The other two dishes sat empty and were not refilled after an hour had past! The website gallery promised us scallops, oysters and we saw none of that ever appearing! The rest of the cooked foods were dried up ( had been sitting there for hours no doubt.)The. Waitresses kept filling up my water glass I am now guessing so I can fill up on water and no eat that awful spread they call one of Singapores finest buffets! What a load of crap! The dessert bar was dismal and horrid! I should have listened to my gut instincts when I walked in the restaurant and there were hardly anyone there! Never ever again! Does not deserve even a 1 star rating

This one restaurant with a nonya, local & international buffet spread.At today's buffet, they had a Penang food promotion where the Penangstandards of assam laksa & char kue teow were featured. Well after returningfrom a recent Penang trip, I rate their Penang offerrings as satisfactory.My picks at this buffet are salmon sashimi, bak kut teh, assam laksa & durianpengat (mousse)They have a section of fresh cockles & 2 types of clams which will blanchedfor you & you have a piquant chilli sauce to go with itThe cold dish of prawns is fresh.The disappointment was the grilled stingray which was rather dried out the sambal had not sufficiently penetrated the stingray for flavour & moistness.They also had their standard offerrings of Singapore laksa & prawn noodles.Service was prompt & friendly, water glasses were topped up &cockery were cleared regularly.Liked that they have a coffee dispenser where you can get freshlybrewed expresso & coffee.Overall, it is value-for-money buffet.BTW, senior citizens pay SGD 31 from the normal SGD 41 for thisbuffet lunch. Dinner rates are higher
