This is the place to buy that delicious Bak kea. (sort of a flat, very tasty, fresh, pliable pork jerky). So great to eat alone or break apart on top of a salad. YUM!

Try a few of the different options. They are all good and the queue of locals is a sure sign that you wont be disappointed

We bought both regular and spicy from the branch in ION. Delicious pork jerky. Had to wait in a queue as one woman seemed to be buying everything in the store. Worth the wait!

This place is my favorite and must to go place in Singapore to buy pork jerky. In my opinion, Lim Chee guan has the best Pork Jerky in Singapore compare to others.

I work for an international company and Lim Chee Guan BBQ pork is The Gift i always pack for guests & colleagues overseas. You could never go wrong. I was told they got snapped up the moment the pack was opened in the office! To counter that i usually pack in 500g and attention to individuals (with instructions for them to bring home & enjoy with their families) while doing 1kg for the team to share. Good things are worth queuing up for. If you have not tried Singapore BBQ Pork get in line and have the best our Island has! Granted there are many other brands besides Lim Chee Guan but no one's comes close in terms of the succulent tender meat bbq-ed to perfection. Its an indulgence I allow myself every once in a while. I'll willingly do an entire week's lunch of salad to hv 300g of Lim Chee Guan's Signature BBQ Pork. Prices about SGD54 per Kg and you could pack by 300g, 500g, 600g or 1kg.

This is definitely not health food so if you have any sort of dietary restrictions, this is probably not for you. It is also extremely addictive, so once you have tried it once, you will always go back for more. It is a reconstituted pork, chicken or beef mince cooked in flat sheets, done in different styles. The spicy ones with chili tend to be very hot, so be careful. Definitely recommended for a taste if you are visiting Singapore. It does tend to get busy at times, so be prepared to stand in line for a considerable amount of time

My first time experiencing Lim Chee Guan is at their store in Orchard, Singapore. And I ordered some of their beef to enjoy it three days later when I go back to my country and the beef still good. The beef is delicious, soft and tasty. Sometimes you have to patiently wait for your turn to order at their store because the queue line is long, but worth the wait

If you haven’t tasted Singapore Pork Jerky, it’s a must-try. Once tried, you will never go back to any other jerkies!It’s juicy, tender on the bite, and good fragrance. You can also pack to go like the picture in sealed packs.Reheat if possible, if not, eating at room temp still great

A Singapore speciality that does not appear in other Chinese communities around the globe, so a real must have when in S'pore. One of the best in town and there are often long queues at this small shop. First time we joined the line of waiting people it was one woman who was buying up the shop that caused the back-up! Went off to check some other shops and when we came back she was just leaving with 2 huge carrier bags of pork - so you know its got to be good! Normally buy the Signature Sliced Pork and the BBQ Chile Slices. Amazing stuff! Highly recommended

Passed by the stores a few times and wondering what was all the fuss and long queue? Especially the other famous beef/pork jerky place is nearby with no lines.Finally queued up when line was relatively short (still about 15 minutes wait) and tried some samples, we were hooked. They did taste better. I especially like the bacon (fat is evil but good! Damn with the heart doctor!)Downside is shelf life is quite short even with refrigeration. So can't really bring home a lot and have a continuous supply which can also be a good thing, because with so many varieties one can put a dent in the pockebook

If you compare this to Bee Cheng Hiang, the commercially famous brand from Singapore, I still prefer this brand. For me it taste better.

Nice, fresh and delicious BBQ in Chinatown. Must try, its different compare to the rest, have sweet and spicy. Always busy and the Q will too long during chinese new year,.normal day is alright

This branch sells the best BBQ pork in Singapore. Worth a try if you are around here. Do not come before Chinese New Year as the queue is mad.
5
Of all the various brands selling BBQ pork. This is the best.
The meat is tender and juicy, not too salty. The others are a bit hard and dry.

The spicy BBQ pork is not to be missed.
However avoid Chinese New Year festives... The Queue is crazy...

BBQ Pork Slices. Generally very well known in this region. There are other brands but personally (personal preference so its up to others to qualify the taste), I prefer Lim Chee Guan. As compared to other brands, LCH BBQ Pork Slices are not too thick and generally aromatic. Prices can be steep during certain festive periods. As for the queue, well, its a snake's queue when it comes to festive periods. Do note you need to keep it in the freezer if its not going to be consumed for a certain period of time. Just ask the staff and they will assist you.If you are looking for gifts back home, do consider LCG else you'd end up with just 1 brand at Changi Airpor

Good location, just on the main road in Chinatown. Got many grilled pork to choose, great tast. I took 3 bags to my home country, my family loved it. Quite many people in the shop while I was there, but the seller was fast so I don't wait for a long time. A bit pricey but this is Singapore. You should try it.

This is the famous. Taste good but slightly sweet for me. My sis like it a lot. However, even though is good i will not join the long queue during CNY(Up to hours queue). Rated based on the food, not sure about its service, but normal non-crowded, they seems fine

Answer is.. No.Definitely no. I must say, perhaps it does taste better than Mei zhen xiang or Fragrance bah kwa, but definitely not worth my time in queuing. It gets moldy faster as compared to MZX ones ( which lasts a few days longer ) before it gets moldy in our Local climate.The best Bah Kwa I say I "may" queue for.. is the another brand that has the pineapple flavor. Can't remember the brand off hand.. but I believe it is the up and coming brand.Apparently they only have 1 or 2 stores right now away from the city. It's either at Changi or Paya Lebar.. Can't be certain

The best BBQ pork in the business. Tasty, tender, flavourful. Renowned throughout Asia, tourist and locals get their BBQ pork fix here. Queues can be scary, but we'll worth it.Only time to avoid this place is during Chinese New Year. Thus is the only period where quality drops due to the ginormous volume
