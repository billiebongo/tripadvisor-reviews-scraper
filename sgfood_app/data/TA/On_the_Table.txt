My friends and I order Mac and Cheese, pulled-pork pasta and quinoa! It tasted really fresh and good. I would love to visit the cafe again!
4
Great food and service. Had the truffle mushroom cream linguine with smoked salmon, which was good. None better than to top it off with their baileys & brownie ice-cream on waffles
5
Excellent food with great service! Also very affordable after NUS discount :) Really likes their carbonara with pulled pork!
3
It was raining when we arrived. The hot & flavourful food which filled our tummies were so yummy that we ordered desserts. Will definitely return to try the coffee & cakes as the atmosphere is cosy and good for couples
4
My friend ordered the Smoked Pulled Pork Carbonara while I ordered Pulled Pork Sanger. We both agreed that the food taste nice. :)
Food was served pretty quickly too.
4
Booking was easy.
Food was to our satisfaction though we waited a little longer for a cup of coffee to be served.
5
One of my favorite cafes as it is very spacious and serves great food. The honey wings are a must-order. Their pastas/burgers are good too. Would recommend going here if you love their sister cafe, Lola cafe. Standard cafe pricing.
4
Good environment and nice catch up place for gathering. Aircon was not strong enough, place to improve.
5
I have visited this restaurant for 3 times within 6 months. In the recent visit, I have tried the pulled duck burger. The taste of the food is just nice and would recommend this burger during dinner time.
4
near our office. but my 1st time to there. many ppl having lunch there.
the salad bowl portion is big enough .
4
Nice ambience, great food! Have been here for 5 times and would totally be back again. However, menu items are really limited.
4
Cozy cafe serving consistently delicious food in Pasir Panjang. Would definitely visit again when I’m in the area
4
Good ambience at the cafe with reasonable pricing for their delicious dishes. will highly Recommend the wings!
5
Nice atmosphere. Not too noisy perfect for team lunches. The food orders were done rather quickly. I had the Pulled Pork Carbonara and it was superb.
5
Food is very good, service is good, ambience is good! Price is not very cheap, may have been to factor in the rental of premises.
3
Fast service, nice ambiance and Good portion but..
Duck meat for the pulled duck burger was rather tough.
5
Their Tomato Swimmer Crab Linguine is always my favourite and never fail to ease my cravings for good pasta!

Offered a table for four and was advised as a single diner I may be asked to move to the shared table. I took the table near the kitchen. Menu is quite extensive and reads well which was made all the more surprising when the food arrived. Im not sure if the kitchen understood the menu and or how to prepare the food or perhaps it was an off day.... I ordered the pulled pork n slaw Sanger on Brioche; served with straight fries; drink was a coffee - long black.Ok; straight Fries; I was at least expecting these to be made fresh on-site as opposed to fresh from the freezer - these are not difficult to "fry-Off"; however; big fail; half cooked; dry; just awful. - The sandwich or (Sanger) - wow.....good size - however - Soggy mess - brioche - personally; this should have been well toasted - on both sides; the inside of the Sanger for the shredded pork filling & the slaw should have been served on the side - this may have stopped the bread from being a soggy mess. I did not eat the soggy bread nor the fries - I ate the filling only which was passable given that it took "6 hours to slow cook", What was very surprising was that no one from the restaurant team came to ask if my meal was ok given that I was in plain view of all the staff working in that area; even one of the chef's came out of the kitchen and looked at the "mess" and not once enquired if anything was amiss. Hopefully the management / operations team from The Better Craft Pte Ltd will review this feedback favourably. Perhaps a "spot - check" on this outlet would also be good to ensure that the staff employed care for where they are and look after their place of work thus ensuring a possible frequent guest return
4
I love the Roasted Butternut Squash Salad but the salad menu was changed. Hope the cafe brings back the Butternut Squash Salad. The service staff attended to us and checked if the food was ok. Although the air con was strong in this cemented-designed place, the warm service compensated for it . Keep up the good customer service .
3
Been there 4 times. Food is generally good. Experience from Previous visits are really good. Only this time, service and food quality seems to lapse. Especially the waffle served was charred. Asked for a new one, staff was willing to replace with a newly made one but at the end all my 3 scopes of ice cream has melted while waiting for the new waffle. As the waffles were given to other tables first instead of ours. So quite disappointed with this visit.
3
Server did not listen to what I was saying and seem to be in a hurry. I was still speaking and the waitress abruptly cut me short and was rushing to have us seated when 1 more member had not arrived yet.
4
Big portions at reasonable prices, and not Super crowded on a public holiday at brunch time. Recommend!
4
Ordered the truffle linguine with bacon which was good and had the waffle with Thai ice cream. Ice cream was a bit too frozen and waffles didn't have enough maple syrup, but taste wise both were still nice. Will be back to try other items!
4
We got the free mac and cheese from the Chope promotion, it was good. Crumbs on top added a good dimension to the texture of the dish. The honey wings were also nice, though we felt it was a bit too sweet.
4
very nice and chill atmosphere, food was unique and creative. abit disappointed in their wings though
3
The cafe is nice & rather cozy, but the food selection is quite limited. Food was okay, not fantastic. But the waffles are worth a try!
4
They were responsive to questions, polite, serve with a smile and try to assist by ensuring they provide better service if possible.
3
Great for a quiet hangout, not crowded. They have a wide selection of menu including waffles, cakes as well as brunch food items.
4
Get's busy so book if you can - even on a weekday when we were here for lunch. The restaurant is one of those 'hipster' minimal feel places - this means that the dining room gets loud and noise carries. Some tables are very close to each other.Water and condiments are self serve so you need to get it yourself. And you have to order and pay at the counter upfront. As you'd expect, table service and service in general is very limited. They are fast to clear plates though. Menu: changes frequently and it is not extensive (the kitchen is pretty small which probably explains why). However, the food is good by Singapore brunch standard. Fries, chicken wings, salad bowls and eggs benedict seem to be constantly popular. Pasta actually looked ok too.Didn't have coffee so unfortunately can't comment. Location is a bit random so unless you live or work nearby, I wouldn't venture all the way to try this
5
It's a superb place for brunch. Peaceful and quiet. Food is served hot and within minutes. Waiter and waitress are all ears to your request. The egg benedicts, crispy honey chicken and hazelnut crunchy cake is a must try. A bit expensive but worth it. My wife will travel from Yishun once again to enjoy the ambience and food. Thank you On The Table❤
5
i come here regularly and i really appreciate the consistency of the fooooood. it's so worth it! highly recommend it
4
I've been there for twice, but this time got more impressive for their linguine and waffles, cozy place , definitely will visit again.
4
Had to wait for a table but the staff was nice and provided good service. Ordered waffle n ice cream. Waffle takes a while to make but worth the wait. Crisp and soft. Ice cream was ok only. Too milky
5
Came here for brunch/lunch on a weekday with my Sister and Cousin! It is a nice cosy cafe with really cool decorations. Food and coffee are pretty decent.
Also, NUS students can get 10% off when you show your student ID! :)
5
Waffle ordered has run out. We were given complementary two scoops of ice cream instead.
Place was used for a function in he afternoon. Seems to be a great place for organizing a function.
4
Great ambience, great service and great value for great food! Location is easily accessible too. Will definitely re-visit.
4
I had lunch at this restaurant and it was great. I had the prawn salad and french fries. It is a small restaurant, located on the roadside. It is spacious inside and the staffs are helpful. It is not recommended for customers looking for big meals.The restaurant does not accept credit cards and also does not offer wifi
4
On The Table is located almost opposite Pasir Panjang MRT station. I stopped here for a late lunch after visiting the nearby Reflections at Bukit Chandu museum.I had a breakfast croissant, which contained scrambled egg, ham and bacon and was served with a salad. To drink, I had a bottle of Number 9 American pale ale.The food and drink were good as was the friendly service. The cost was just over SIN$24.One slight down side was that the menu was a little limited
5
My group of 5 got in around 11.30am and were pleasantly surprised with a nice cosy setting that wasn't crowded at all!! :) We were all very happy with our food, waffles too - no wonder this place is known for it :D If anything, the mocha was a little lacking in coffee/thickness. Otherwise a very pleasant experience indeed
5
Reservation was quick and hassle free with chope. Loved their salmon quinoa with sous vide egg. The salted caramel ice cream tasted weird but the Thai milk tea and earl grey ice cream tasted good! Waffles with 3 scoops of ice cream at $12 nett! So worth it. The honey chicken wings are crispy and juicy
5
Still the best cafe with quality food in my opinion! Their food never disappoints and always made my day!
4
Not many branch places in the area so we settled for this. The food was surprisingly good, although the menu did not have as many options as we would prefer.
It's our 2nd visit and the food quality is consistent.
5
My first time eating there. We tried the Roasted Butternut Squash Salad, Crispy Honey Wings, Spicy Smoked Pulled Pork Carbonara and Crispy Chicken Burger. The food was delicious. My kids also enjoyed it. Recommended!
4
overall a thumb up. except that chai tea latte wasnt to our liking ( personal opinion) as it was really strong. but its nice overall. def coming back.
5
Love going for Branch there... Great place to chill and have your own time with your loved ones. Their Rosewater Lychee Cake is a must have!
5
Tried their sister cafe Lola's and loved the chicken wings. But we always come back to OTB for their amazing waffles, with Thai milk tea and early grey ice cream!!
5
Headed down with my girlfriend to have brunch, the food are good and the place is cozy on a sunday afternoon.
4
Simple, typical cafe but I like the feel of it. The food are interesting and tasty as well. Only thing is, location not as convenient. Love to be back more but the location just made me held back.
4
Our return visit. This time we ordered Crispy Honey Wings, their house signature snack, the deep-fried mid-wing has a nice crispy skin with juicy and tender meat. We ordered the Utimate Crossiant where the butter croissant was served with honey glazed bacon, ham, honey mayo, scrambled eggs chaddar cheese and mesclun salad. Reasonable price and good standard. We had our favourite Smoked Salmon and Avocado Eggs Benedict too
3
The waffle was a major letdown; it was soggy and felt like the mixture had too much flour. A far cry from the "crispy" waffle I enjoyed previously. Thankfully, the ice cream was good - highly recommend the earl grey flavored ice cream if you're in the vicinity!
5
Lovely cafe, generous serving & friendly staff. Love the Ultimate Croissant is a must-have...the serving was so huge we didn't manage to try their cakes even though they look so appetising!
4
The overall vibe of the cafe was good but it was a little too noisy, not the kind of cafe where you would sit and chat with a friend. Maybe more suitable for groups.
4
Will definitely be back for the crispy honey wings, roasted butternut squash salad and pulled pork sangers!
4
The food was great and service was excellent as well. Portions were adequate too. The location is great too as it is conveniently located at pasir panjang and walkable from the MRT. I would recommend it to everyone!
5
loved the food and the atmosphere. It was full house when we visited but nonetheless, excellent service, food and ambience. Would definitely visit again.
4
On the table has a cozy atmosphere for Sunday brunch. The food was tasty and priced as a good value.
5
Had a wonderful dinner. Usually was quite difficult to get a table during dinner. Luckily we've made reservation. Food was great - the honey wings, crab meat linguine and waffle ice-cream. Yummy!
5
Waffle is the best. And the brunch choices are all very tasty such as salmon Benedict and ultimate croissant.
5
Went with my partner for a weekend lunch, and while the cafe is small, there wasn't a queue. The service was good with plenty of smiles served with each order of food and other petty little requests. Truffles fries came in a big portion with a really good truffle & cheese dip. Truffle cream linguine had a very aromatic cream, though the truffle smell was lacking. The mushroom toast was a surprising winner
5
Casual dining serves very good food. Price is reasonable. We had Chorizo penne (pasta was al dente sauce was meaty and tasty), braised pork with truffle mash (a little dry but the truffled mash made it up). The waffle was fluffy and crunchy, with beautiful ice creams. Coffee was good too!!! The only sad back is the noise, as the interior is cement everywher
4
Ambience was perfect for gatherings, food was pleasant and coffee was good. Overall a good experience
5
Good Ambiance, went on a Sunday. No crowd, good place to talk and chill out with friends. Food is nice and affordable too.
5
Had family brunch after a good walk at the Southern Ridges. The food portion is huge and at affordable prices. Highly recommended
3
Chef staring at us eating our food. Had fried chicken burger which was greasy, felt abit sick after eating. Truffle fries was alright. Shaky tables.
5
Celebrated my birthday there. The food and coffee was great. They even played me the birthday song twice haha. I was so embarrassed. Thank you!
3
service was fast and overall good although food was pretty average. also wish the place was more accessible!
5
The service was friendly. The food very good. Although the pasta took a whole to be brought out due to a large number of orders, it was very good.
5
Cafe had a great ambience and the food was wondeful, recommend the chicken wings! We also tried the pasta which was great as well! :)
5
This is the 4th time my husband and I were here for a dinner and this restaurant has never failed to satisfy our appetites :) We still remember browsing thru facebook somewhere last year and it was in a list where it's a 'must try cafes in Singapore', so we tried.. The Pork Goulash should really be a signature dish; after being here a few times, the taste did not change at all and it's perfectly seasoned.. (always order when we visit) We usually order something new on their menu with our favourite the Pork Goulash and every new item surprises us in the best way possible. The waffles never fails as they are crispy yet still chewy and the ice creams are amazing flavours.. (a must have for dessert even if we are full from our meal) Service can be better, but over the period that we have visited, the service staffs would welcome and guests warmly. Improved a lot from the first time we went there. Even the decor of the restaurant has improved over time Keep it up, OTT!
4
Love coming to this restaurant!! Managed to get in just before 9pm .. last order. Did not have everything we wanted but knowing the menu helps. We had the Golash, Sausage and mash and the friend chicken ... and of course to top it off ... the MUST have ... waffles. I highly recommend the waffles. The Fish Nachos was not available on that day ... another highly recommended dish ... I also love the sausage and mash ... at $10 it helps fill you up and it's nice comfort foo
4
This is the sister cafe of Lola Cafe and is located at Pasir Panjang (stone throw away from the MRT station).
4
Tried latte and find it better than most general cafe. Food menu for dinner has slightly twist to the usual mena. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.
3
The mac and cheese was quite a disappointment and same goes for the truffle mayo fries. However, their truffle cream mushroom pasta was not bad! Honey wings taste similar to that of Lola's cafe so it was pretty good!
5
Came at a friend's recommendation. Wasn't disappointed!
Hot chocolate was a bit disappointing though, was only lukewarm.
Food was otherwise pretty decent!
3
Was late for the booking, but thankfully there were seats available. Overall, experience was average.
3
Foods presentation not bad , foods taste just standard CAFE foods... not much choice for the diner. Staff service can be improved by take more attention once customer finishes the foods.. clear up the dishes.
4
We tried to fish baja tacos, chorizo arrabbiata penne and duck confit. All had good portions and tasted great.
5
Came upon this restaurant after a hike along the Henderson Waves and visiting HortPark and Chandu War Memorial. Fast casual service with a range of brunch options that included quinoa/chicken bowl and spicy sausage pasta - both were well portioned and tasty. Wide variety of drinks including beer. Others were enjoying coffee and desserts The only downside is cash or Nets payment. Friendly service. Otherwise a nice find post hike (and just before we jumped on our bus back to our hotel!
3
Just had brunch there with a friend. Ordered their pulled pork sander and friend had their big breakfast (Big One). We also ordered a pot of earl grey and a cup of latte.This is quite "canteen" style where you have are to place your order with the cashier and collect your own condiments i.e. Sugar, ketchup, chili, etc from a corner. What surprises me was that they don't accept credit cards, which I find it unusual as most establishments in Singapore does. They only accept cash or NETS. The cost of our meal was around S$43. So if you are a tourist and wants to try this cafe, please bring along sufficient cash with you or you can pop over to the Fat Boy burger place just beside it (which accepts credit card as I recalled).Food was ok for the price. The pulled pork was not as tender as I expected (menu said slow cooked for 6 hours) but the brioche bread that was served with it was nice. Friend said the big breakfast was only ok but portion s big as she couldn't finished her eggs and sausage. Place gets crowded so you may want to make a reservation. Another thing that was quite annoying was they kept calling you to confirm their reservation. We responded to the automated call but we got another call within 3 minutes from their staff as well. It was not even crowded when we reached there (we were there around 11am). They can definitely improve on this, and yes, including accepting credit cards as payment.
4
I was craving food with truffles and On The Table satisfied my cravings! We adored the truffle fries that came with truffle mayo and the truffle mushroom pasta is heavenly! My partner ordered the big one, and I loved their scrambled eggs! Every item on the plate is prepared with love and they taste really fresh so we are really delighted! The cafe is rather spacious and prices are reasonable with no service charge and no gst
3
Over food was good but some of the service staff could do with some smile to brighten up the place. I noticed a few staff (mainly female) were wearing grouchy expression and they don't give way to customers when they are in their way.
4
It wasn't my first visit. Went there a couple of times for lunch/brunch. But it was my first time there for dinners don't really like the dinner menu :(
5
The staff were really friendly and accommodating! They were very efficient and tended to our needs really well. Also, the ambience in this cafe was great, perfect for a dinner out with family and friends.
5
It was my 2nd visit here to try their dinner menu and i really enjoyed the meal. Food was good and so was the coffee! Will revisit again for sure!
5
Ordered wings, duck confit and chicken burger.
Nice atmosphere and food was great, service was friendly as well
4
The waffle was delicious. Despite of the ice cream, it did not become soggy.
My friends and I ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict, Truffle Mushroom Toast and Tomato Swimmer Crab Linguine. They were tasty as well. We will definitely return to try the other dishes.
4
Food portion was generous, taste of the food was above average too. Ambience was quiet, good for catchup too! Perosnally liked the fish tacos
4
My friends want to come here for brunch. We ordered Ultimate Croissant, truffle mushroom toast, Table's carbonara spicy and non spicy, Chicken and butternut squash bowl, Crispy honey wings and truffle fries.I love their crispy honey wings the most, the rest was delicious too. Next time, i will try Ultimate Croissant as the egg was very nice. The truffle mushroom toast has strong truffle smell which we loved it. Remember to bring cash or nets for payment
3
Being a finicky person for brunch offerings, I did find the quality of the food lackluster. The place definitely did make up for it in terms of service and value for money, variety and presentation. The ice cream flavours have a local twist! Will have to try the dinner menu for further conclusions.
5
I have been here a few times. Loved the casual atmosphere and spacious restaurant. Favourite brunch selection is pulled pork in grilled sandwich and Favourite drink is iced matcha latte. Food is reasonably priced and with no compulsory service charge and GST a meal there is indeed very affordable. Partially self service with order at the counter and payment first. Food is however served at the table. Reservations on weekends are recommended as the place is popular
5
Thumbs up for the food and coffee as both were really fantastic! Will definitely head back again to try other dishes!
4
This is my second visit to On The Table and the food is as good as my first visit. The cafe is small and cosy and it looks really good for casual or intimate events!
4
Will recommend to those who likes to chillax in a Vintage and Antique fusion atmosphere. Variety of food there is enough but for those looking for more choices will have to reconsider. Overall, the food are delicious and friendly service crew👍🏻
2
Food was not palatable. A friend of mine was unable to identify the dishes when I sent photos to him. Even my parents who were present at the table couldn't tell what was being served. Better luck elsewhere. Save the trip and save the money.
5
cute. plesant. quite bussy with a nice buzz.
it's just around the corner from where we live, so we often drop by for coffee&cake or a quick lunch. always a pleasure.
4
This is my first time going to On The Table for dinner (usually I go for lunch). Would say food taste better for lunch than dinner. Not sure why. Service remains very good and the place is kids friendly. They brought kids cutlery automatically without us having to ask (unlike some high class restaurant at MBS who give me a curt 'No. Don't have' when we ask for them). We love their honey wings and waffles. The golash and mac and cheese were ok.. we've had better.
4
OTT is our local and my wife and i are there on a fairly regular basis.The team know how to make a great coffee and the menu selection is very reasonable. My wife loves the truffle fries.They also have a wide variety of different local and international beers, from the occasional saison to lagers and pale ales which you can have there with your meal or purchase.The staff are always friendly and the atmosphere, relaxed
3
Since we were near Science Park II, I goggled for a cafe nearby.OTT is next to Fat Boy's The Burger.I told the staff that it was my first time in OTT so she recommended me Fries with Truffle Mayo for a starter. We also ordered the following items namely-Crispy Honey Wings, Gnocchi in Miso Pasta and 1 waffle with Bailey n Brownie and Salted caramel ice-creams.Complimentary warm n ice waters next to the cashier.Review on my orders would be :Crispy Honey Wings - 8/10Gnocchi in Miso Butter - 8/10 (not too buttery)Fries with Truffle Mayo - 3/10 (no truffle oil)Waffle with 2 scopes of ice-creams -6/5 (waffle was dry)
4
One of the best cafÃ©/restaurant that serves reasonable priced good food and service with free flow sky juices. I've tried the waffle ice cream which is not bad (Creamier will be the better place for waffles) and the pulled pork sandwich, truffles fries (more truffle taste in the mayo), crispy wings (nicer than the Korean ones methink), the big one, swimmer crab linguine (my fav) and a healthier choice of quinoa bowl which I cannot remember its exact "name" haha. Tried a lot since we are all sharing food BTW :
5
This place is a must visit if you are a lover of cafe breakfast. They serve excellent coffee and options on their breakfast menu looks super. I got The Big One (two toasts, bratwurst sausage, pork bacon and ham, served with two sunny side up). If you are a beer drinker they have an amazing collection of craft beer.
4
Perfect spot for a rainy afternoon hangout with friends. Nice waffles and orifice cream. Coffee is not my favorite.
Design is cosy and modern, good place!
5
Awesome food and service especially the crispy wings and waffles. Would be glad to come here again to try the other dishes.
4
Based on my friends' feedbacks, food was good. Service is great,they hold the table for an additional 5mins for us. The crew also accommodated to our request to serve the birthday boy with the waffle. They even sang a birthday song for him.
5
Perfect for a weekend brunch when you want a diet friendly meal. Convenient to reach by mrt. The service is prompt and the food is delicious.
3
Waffles are reasonable , however price on the high side,coffee is disappointing, try few occasions, no improvement at all. Will not go back
4
Decided to break the fast one day here on my son's birthday, and even though it was too late for making reservation (within an hour), the staff squeezed us in for that purpose, which was so kind of her (wish I asked for her name, she was very helpful). Since that day, we have visited On The Table three times in a same week because of their menu which is very different than most cafes you found in Singapore, and we were satisfied with our meal each time!Limited dessert choices but what they have are good. Only downside for us is their coffee, as coffee drinkers we did not like their coffee which they proudly blend in house, and also they served it warm not hot. The staff knows their stuff and very lovely!! The ambience is nic
4
We wanted to try a new place and tried On The Table after reading some reviews. And after first visit, our second and third were on the same week. They have good food and creatively prepared, so even though they are not a big restaurant, the food are different from most Singapore cafes and the ambience is nice - except for one morning where it was too full so a bit too noisy. Menu is not too big and as we don't eat pork it limited our choices, but still we were happy.Variety of drinks is good too, however, as a coffee lover, I didn't like coffee (which they blend in house)Staff is lovely.... Will definitely come again
3
When there for dinner and brunch once. Sometimes, the seatings make it hard to move around. Have to go to the counter to order food yourself and bring your water to yourself. if I am not wrong, no service charges apply. BUT THE TRUFFLE FRIES ARE DARN GOO
3
Had always wanted to try the place and finally had a chance to swing by because the next door Fatboys was packed. The menu is very creative and modern and its a blend of self service order/pay and bring your own utencils and cold water to your own table. Your food will be served by them. The waitress who served us was very friendly and helpful. I guess all these young staff are. Food is Zen-like fusion with ingredients that are very intriguing. Decor and layout has that hipster ambience. Overall I gave it a Average + and it will appeal to young couples and groups.Do not get me wrong, food is not entirely bad but I just expected better and stronger in taste. Room for improvement and that'' s why we should frequent the place and feedback to them more
5
Our family had an unplanned lunch here today and not only were we taken by the the eclectic decor and family friendly ambience, the food we had was delicious and well presented too. The pull pork sandwich and the roast chicken pumpkin cous cous salad were great. Staff were enthusiastic and friendly even at busy lunch hour. To top it off, we had a masala chai tea with soya milk, for me - that was a great end to our meal. Do keep up the good work with friendly and fast service. Will definitely be back.
4
I had the Truffle Mushroom Toast and it was very delicious. I was still thinking of how delicious it was that I had to tell my colleague this morning. Definitely will plan to go and try what are on the menu. Thank you.
4
Second time we've popped in here on the way to the southern ridges walk. Sunday brunch menu is varied and tasty food arrived. Relaxed atmosphere with friendly and prompt service. A little gem if you are heading out this way
4
Spacious , great ambience , lovely service, nice food. I would definitely come back again to visit this place
3
Service very good waffle and earl grey ice creams, but not the latte, inferior quality beans , service good.
5
It's my return trip with my friend. Food and drinks serve very fast. Service are good, food taste superb. Definitely will go Onthetable again! Oh ya, the best part is, there is no service charge / GST.
5
It's a nice cafe in Pasir Panjang area. Love their fries, wings and waffles with ice cream! Sadly all day breakfast is not available in the evening!
5
Been here multiple times and food and service remains great. I love the honey wings and wafers with ice cream. Absolute must trys!
4
We've passed this place a few times but were put off by the lack of items on the menu. Yet it always seemed popular. So there must be something to try so we went on a Saturday night around early evening. Plenty of tables available at that time. One chooses one's food and pays at the bar. Iced water is self service, also at the bar.The starter was sausage and mash. Good sausage samples that were tasty. Proper mashed potato finished this off.Pulled pork sandwich was not what I expected. It was nice but I preferred to eat mine dipped in the Sausage and mash gravy. Else it would have been too dry otherwise. Accompanied by a cup of fries, for me, this meal needs a gravy to enjoy it.Mexican rice with a hot pot of meat was nice and well presented. Plenty of meat made this a nice meal.Dessert was nice but once again, a little difficult to fully enjoy without some custard or a scoop of ice cream. Different strokes I suppose.Coffee and tea was available.Place had a nice ambience and we will return to try the wings and duck that was on the menu. The whole bill came to around $45. Friendly staff and a busy, but professional kitchen that can be seen from the restaurant.Give it a try
3
It must be a bad day for me. First, Chope could not let me make a reservation on the actual day, so I called OTT but got a voice mail that told me to click on a link that would be sent to me via SMS. The link of course sent me back to Chope. I arrived at OTT at 6pm without a reservation and half the tables were empty, so don't be fooled if you cannot get a reservation via Chope for a weekday dinner. Then, my friend realised that the OTT offer on the Entertainer app had been terminated. Zzzz...Anyway, the food. Menu was a set of grubby papers fastened to a clipboard. No photos or bloated descriptions. Perhaps there was no need for all that, just let the food do the talking. Confidence. I like.I ordered Prawn Aglio Olio. It came with 6 succulent prawns, yummy. Fat, fat prawns that were good for munching on. My friend found it good too. I dipped into my friend's Salmon and Mushroom Cream Linguine. It was pretty strong and creamy at first taste, so I am not sure I would be able to enjoy it from first bite to last. Could get too cloying for me. The food portions were huge for us, both being regular-sized female diners. We left OTT badly in need of a walk so we had to give the desserts a miss.Young and friendly staff. Largely self-service so no service charge. Warm and cool lemonised water available FOC but gotta go pour some yourself. Same with cutlery, condiments and serviettes. Dim lighting, high ceilings and ... I do not remember if there was any music, but in short, it was a conducive environment for quiet conversations.It's a pity I could not say more cos I have only tasted one dish. I will be back
4
This cafe is near to the mrt station and prices are reasonable. Will be better to make a reservation in advance though I waited less than 10 mins for a table. The starters and pastas were great but dessert options were limited. There were only 3 types of cakes to select from and waffles (with or without ice cream). The ice cream selections were interesting and you get to try before ordering. Will definitely go back again for the pasta
4
The staff were extremely friendly. Food was nice and served quickly. The servings were reasonable. The ambience of the place was very nice.

They've arranged a table big enough for 5pax. Service was fast. Good reccomendation for girls night out!

The food is great, just like Lola's. The Crispy Honey Wings and Tomato Swimmer Crab Linguine are delightful. Hope it won't become too overcrowded in future!

Delicious and reasonably priced café near the Pasir Panjang MRT. Really enjoyed the setting and food, delicious!

Overall good. Will be much better if the smoked salmon is smoked enough. Like it for not crowded and noisy as other cafes!

On The Table is the sister café of Lola’s Café, and is situated along Pasir Panjang Road. If you’re travelling by MRT, the nearest station is Pasir Panjang, on the yellow-orange coloured Circle Line. There’s only one exit, Exit A. Cross the overhead bridge to get to the other side and walk in the direction of Yew Siang Road, you should see the café shortly BEFORE the junction with Pepys Road.On The Table is definitely a lot more spacious compared to Lola’s, and can accommodate bigger groups as well. In any case, do make full use of the online reservation tool if you are thinking of coming during lunch or dinner hours. The café was still nice and quiet at 11am but soon quickly filled up with hungry lunch-goers by noon.We had the ongoing lunch promotion, which was Eggs Atlantic and a glass of iced tea for S$15. The mains selection was quite limited for the promotion, but still quite worth it in my opinion, considering an Eggs Atlantic a la carte costs S$16. My friend ordered the Salmon and Mushroom Cream Truffle Linguine. The Eggs Atlantic was good; thought the eggs were well cooked, and the accompanying rocket salad was also dressed perfectly. The brioche toast was quite dry, but perhaps intentionally done this way so that it mops up the oozing yolk more easily?! Even the iced tea was good! We also got the Fries with Truffle Mayo (S$8), which was really crisp and cut nice and thin the way I like it. For desserts, we ordered the waffle with ice cream (S$10 for double scoop; S$12 for triple), and I must say, the waffle with ice cream was heavenly! The waffle was thick and incredibly fluffy, and the scoops were rather generous in serving. The winner for me was their homemade ice cream, which was really smooth and not to mention quite flavourful as well. We had a really good time tasting their Belgian Chocolate, Thai Milk Tea, Peanut & Caramel, Baileys & Brownie, as well as their limited edition Blackforest flavours.The staff here were nice and pleasant, and service here was generally quite efficient even with the crowd. While service may not be as exceptional as at Lola’s, I would say the food served at On The Table tasted a lot better. Who can say no to waffle ice cream

Dined here few weeks back with my family on a late Saturday morning. The tables are well spaced and had a seperate dining area with couches that can accommodate larger group to dine in. We ordered truffle fries, eggs Atlantic, mushroom and cheese sandwich, iced chai latte, passion fruit and ginger soda and a flat white. The truffle fries was crunchy and serving just nice. The mushroom and cheese sandwich was fantastic. Buttered brioche toasts complemented the mozzarella cheese and mushroom with bechamel sauce. The eggs Atlantic was great too. It came with poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, salad and thick slab of smoked salmon.The drinks were great too. Even though the soda was from a bottle, it tasted nice. The iced chai latte was one of the best I ever had. The flat white was impressive too but I felt the quantity was tad little for the price paid.Overall, it one of the gem in the west, serving delicious breakfast at a reasonable price

I bumped into this place, be it that i was on the most unlikely tourist place in singapore. Squeezed between a viaduct and Hort Park (which is probably the reason it is there, since it's university spot) you find this really great place. I was there today and i will take the orange MRT to Pasir Panjang again to just go for their breakfast. Today i had the second most delicious chicken salad in years (the best is in manila, at Marie Grace).Anyway, they combine the real coffee house feel with a hip dining setting. They have breakfast but also a extensive beer selection (with a mouth full of fatty snacks)...The staff was so willing to suggest me on the menu...great young people!Great vibe, remote place but ideal to eat and then find your way into Kent Ridge Park or direction Mount Faber!

This is our first time trying On The Table (we liked Lola's cafe albeit way smaller) We had ultimate croissant, salmon and mushroom truffle linguine, eggs Benedict, and honey wings to share. The food's pretty good, although the scrambled eggs were too much(keep in mind I love eggs) and overcooked. Honey wings were great although Lola's cafe had better seasoned wings. The staff didn't bother to check if there were enough utensils for the three of us before placing it on our table. The waitress cleared our plates(only upon request, we wanted to make space for dessert) with a black face. We ordered a waffle with double scoop ice cream to share for dessert too, which was disappointing because the cafe was pretty much empty, and yet (with more staffs available than the number of occupied tables), it took 20 minutes for a small piece of waffle to be served. Again, we had a utensil stand without any utensils in it. nobody bothered to greet us when we entered, or when we're leaving. Maybe we might be too critical here but aren't all these basic services all customers should be getting? What is the point of paying for service charge when we don't get any unless asked for?

Food is ok. Prices are expensive for this ambience. Better to take mrt to Pasir Panjang or park at the food centre as there are limited car park spaces along the side road.
5
Food is awesome and value for money. Service staff are all well trained and friendly. A cafe that I will definitely return again.

Love the crispy waffles topped with ice cream! Perfect combi ^^ you'll have to try their popular honey wings too! As for mains, the truffle mushroom salmon linguine is worth a try!

A hidden gem in Pasir Panjang, great place for brunch/or if you just want to chill. Relaxed ambience with good food. Staff are nice too!
Will definitely come back :)

OTT is only a walking distance from Pasir Panjang MRT station, out frm station, goes out to walkway, u will see a overhead bridge, cross the bridge to the opposite site, walk down the stairs, walk straight ahead, you will see some shops & Rest. OTT is just behind the bus stop. This cafe served value for money food. On this day, we ordered a few dish to share & they are all yummy.We had their croissant and is something we are familiar with, here the croissant is buttery, crispy and it goes well with the scrambled eggs, SIgnature honey wings is delicious, crispy skin with some spices & honey. One of the best wings I have tried for a cafe. Prawn Linguine was well done, noodles was al dente, Prawns was fresh & goes well with the mixed herbs & sauce used. Salad with chicken was good, fresh Veges like rocket was mixed with some salad sauce & roast chicken, overall combination was excellent. Truffles fries was crispy. And to end the meal, a conscientiously crafted cup of coffee with their in house lychee cake ends a sweet & memorable Saturday afternoo

I must say, OTT is one of Pasir Panjang's best-kept secrets. If you don't know where to look, you may even miss the place because of it's rather inconspicuous location. I've been here maybe three or four times, initially just having cakes and coffee. But on my most recent visit with friends a few weeks ago, I tried their lunch set menu, opting for Salmon, Mushroom Truffle Cream Linguine, and my mind was blown! It was creamy and dreamy - for a very reasonable price! The portion was quite big, but being pregnant and all, I didn't have problems polishing off my plate!:) We ordered their super moist chocolate cake and there could not have been a better way to cap our very satisfying lunch. They also have a wide selection of fancy-named craft beers (never tried 'em) which you can check out if you are into beers. Another thing that I like here is the ice cream selection. My favourites are salted caramel and earl grey. Too bad I don't live in the neighbourhood or I would've certainly been a regular patron at OTT. Definitely recommended

The food never disappoints. I had the salad with chicken (again) which I love and of course the waffle and ice cream. The service seemed inconsistent. Everything was good until my friend ordered a second cup of coffee which took a long time so she had to ask the staff to check on it.The space is nicely done and as a designer I really like it. The only down side is the noise level due to the hard, flat surfaces all around us. Conversation starts getting difficult when the place fills up with more people.I would still recommend it as a place to go for families or catching up with friends

The two breakfast sets we ordered were nothing like how they were described on menu. A lot of fried food for what was supposed to be a healthy breakfast, the waitress was smile-less and gave rude responses. Homemade bread was also surprisingly bad - it's so hard in some parts you could feel the dough in it.

I went for lunch with my friends. My friends had Table Salad and Pasta while I had Eggs Atlantic. The food was good value for money. We then had the waffle and ice cream for dessert and it was really crispy and yummy! A very generous scoop of ice cream with a big piece of waffle! My friend found the coffee (long black) too acidic, though the latte was fine

This is one of the newest cafe to have sprung up along Pasir Panjang area.We love their all day breakfast's menu and my mother in law said that their Benedict egg was one of the best she has eaten .The crabs pasta is good as well. And that honey chicken wings are addictive!I've had their waffles and I like it how it's crispy. Food arrival was quick and this is one place you could chill with friends easily
