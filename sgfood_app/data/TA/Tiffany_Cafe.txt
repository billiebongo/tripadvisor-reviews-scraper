The food at this restaurant is horrible. Most of the dishes were tasteless, including even the wasabi. When I put a lot of wasabi on the sashimi, I couldnâ€™t taste taste the wasabi. The only things that I found acceptable were the fruits.
2
Service ok. I use to patronise here often but stop as the variety of buffet dishes gone from bad to worse.
4
There is a good variety of choices from Asian stuff eg sushi, nonya kueh, laksa, to western stuff eg chocolate brownies and cheese cakes.
4
We were staying a night there and the hotel offer $ 25 / 2 adult and $8/kids for breakfast.
I should say the price is reasonable and the food was alright with many choices.

Counter staff's attitude was far from desirable. I approached her with regards to the conflicting start time of the high tea buffet (hotel's website vs another site) and she could not be more bothered to answer my question. Turns out, the information on the hotel site was outdated - buffet starts at 3.00pm, not 2.45pm as shown on the hotel website.Food choices were so limited - a laksa booth (pretty much the only decent station there; broth and ingredients are okay as well), some fried food (was not even hot), steamed dim sum (of pretty terrible quality), some sushi (octopus was too hard, tamago was overcooked with a weird taste etc), desserts generally TOO SWEET.Was a total disappointment for a dessert lover like myself. Not to mention some cakes did not have any refills midway through the buffet session. The only upside I can see in all of this is that the buffet is pretty cheap/affordable. But considering the ridiculously little food choices there, I would not see myself going back again any time soon

Went there for lunch on a weekend. I'd have to say their spread was good but honestly could be better. They have a section that provides Asian selections like carrot cake, laksa and chicken rice so that's good. Seafood section has salmon sashimi, mussels, cold prawns (I think the prawns were our fav). Dessert was good.Overall I'd suggest to go elsewhere if it's for an exclusive meal. If you're a hotel guest, then it's decent.

Neat China town of you are craving for Halal Food. This is the place to be. A very reasonably priced buffet with lot of choices for all type of people whether it be veg, halal, seafood, meat, chicken or health conscious. If you have a sweet tooth lot to choose.

Went for this buffet because of the promotion. Noted some feedback about it. Pros Halal buffet, good place to visit when I am dining with Malay friends Affordable pricing Good location at city centre Cons Limited food options Food wise, not all foods are tasty, some are only of hawker average standard Staff were not able to refill food on time when the crowd starting coming in Venue wise, not very large Something noteworthy. I was dining with a female member who placed her handbag on the chair. When the waiter was clearing the dishes, he was not aware that he had unknowingly poured the soy sauce on my family's handbag, until I pointed it out. Waiter seems to be working on auto-pilot mode and not very mindful of the error that he made. However, he eventually apologised and gave some plain water to clean up the stain which was quite a large patch. Note to restaurant staff that they should be more alert when working, not until the customer points it out

"My first visit with friends for High Tea. Price quite reasonable $19.90++ ($23.40 nett). Varieties not much (waffles,chocolate fondue,fruits,cakes,laksa,siew mai and few others) Drinks free flow coffee,tea,ice water. Quite a quiet place for over the weekdays High Tea. Suitable for business and casual meeting too. But just a minor feedback for the front hostess to smile more and be little tone down when speaking to guests. I came in for 245pm reservation but was told to wait at 300pm since its not ready (she was engaged with call when i came in) I didnt catch her name. Hoping to make a come back for either lunch or dinner but with a better service.

I would highly recommend this lovely restaurant !I will back on 23/8/17 for dinner 
3
Wide variety of food especially seafood - prawns, clams, sashimi etc.
Selection of local cuisines - laksa and chicken rice and also durian dessert.
Not bad for $28.
5
Excellent food. A buffet giving you a chance to try so many different types and styles of food. Taste sensation and desert if a "High Tea" dream of selections as well as cakes, fruit, waffles, ice cream and of course the chocolate fountain.
4
We had our department dinner recently and is a great option for have team with Muslim and vegetarian colleagues as they cater for both parties with great varieties of food.
5
Love their breakfast with many local & Western varieties. The food has delicious taste. Only downfall is the restaurant is truly outdated.
2
There was a promotion of S$28.80 nett on their lunch buffet. So we went for the first time. The variety of the cooked food was limited. They offered Soya sauce noodle, tom yam fish, kangkong cuttlefish (which is the only plus point, since I have never come across in other hotel buffet, some other meat stuff like chicken, beef. Seafood like clam and prawn available. Sushi is not nice, but there are sashimi. Chicken rice booth, but my mum feels the chicken is not fresh. There were more varieties on pastry and ice cream available. Overall experience-I will not come back again due to the varieties and taste of the food even if there is another promotion going on

Tiffany, Furama City Centre is having Great Singapore Sales Lunch Buffet at $28.80 net till end of July '17. My family just celebrated our son's 35th Birthday/Father's Day at Tiffany, Furama City Centre . Quite sometime did not visit Tiffany - expensive without promotion.

Bills > $200 entitled to lucky draw. I "spin the wheel" and is rewarded with a (free) High Tea Voucher worth about $23

Tiffany Cafe serves one of the better salmon sashimi among those that I have come across during buffets. Their slices are neither too thin nor thick, just the way I like it. I love how the sashimi will melt in my mouth. They serve both local and international cuisine and is a good gathering place for family and friends. The durian pengat is a must have for all durian lovers!
4
This is a Halal cafe and the food are fresh. Usually go there when there is credit card promotions. If you are going there for lunch or dinner, better call up for reservation. Don't expect a big spread of food but there are plenty of food to keep you going back for second serving
3
If you're looking for a halal family buffet, you can consider coming over. The price per pax is quite expensive but overall the food was all good especially the desserts selection. The layout of the entire place is quite old as compared to other buffets places. Things to look out for are their sashimi and the laksa which I think is quite nice, the rest of the food are just about average.
3
We were tired so decided to eat at hotel. The buffet was pretty pricey and we weren't that hungry, so went for Ala Carte menu. Food was ok, service not so great. They never checked on us, and we had to ask for everything we needed. The room was full of very loud parties, and the lighting was too bright for relaxation. It was a Friday night, and people were obviously enjoying their parties, and seemed to be enjoying the buffet
5
We stayed at the Furama City Centre which is a part of this cafe. the break here was good. there was a good selection of things. They provide halal meat here which is a bonus
3
Had the buffet, not a fan of buffets, but overall wasn't bad. Had a range of hot and cold foods, a lot of very pretty cakes and deserts, coffee and juice. Only negative - I decided to try the durian fruit as I had seen it everywhere. It is definitely an acquired taste (I almost threw up - ha ha)

Tiffany cafe is located inside Furama hotel. Easily access via MRT. Nearest MRT station is Clark Quay or Chinatown within walking distance. The buffet spread is nothing to shout about. I was with a group of friends. Not worth paying if it for 1 for 1. Lasksa gravy was so watery like soup and tasteless. The pumpkin soup and pasta tasted like burned plastic. I don't know why there so many people saying is a great buffet place. Service is ok as the food replenish quite fast. The problem is the quality of food which does not justify the price. Will not go back there again
1
In my opinion, this is one of the worst buffet even if it costs 1 for 1 for certain credit card promotion which works out to be $30+ each. It would be better to spend $30 elsewhere or even at hawker centre. Firstly, the buffet spread is limited. The prawns (quite small) not as fresh as what you would expect. The "gong gong" also not so good as you can have better ones at east coast hawker centre. The salmon is quite good but badly sliced as some pieces sticked together. There appears to be only 2 service staff clearing the plates Which is severely inadequate for a Friday evening. The poor aunty really tried her best to clear as fast as possible. The pasta also not evenly cooked. The dessert bar (watermelon not so fresh) and the cakes counter quite limited I will not go there again or recommend this as a place to dine
4
We stayed at furama hotel and had breakfast buffet daily here. Very good variety that changes slightly daily. Sometimes it was a bit confusing as to what is vegetarian and what is not and we had to ask (since my wife and I are vegetarians). But over all, it was great. Can't comment on the lunch or dinner since hotel staff advised us it would not be worth it for vege folks like us.
2
I went for the buffet yesterday, 27/10. Bought the voucher from Groupon at $33, I do not think it is worth that price. Very very average spread as a buffet, average for tourists. However for us locals, having chicken rice, meepok soup, vegetables with abalone sauce, it is not worth the money. We can have that in the hawker for $3.50. Their beef was hard, prawns wasn't very fresh, their vegetable has no taste, baked potato was very dry. Salmon was very fresh however it was very badly sliced. Their desserts are pretty good. Service was slow, service staff was busy talking to each other instead of clearing plates.I,however have been having mild diarrhoea the next day after the buffet(today), all my friends who went had the same issue. I highly suspect it is due to the buffet.I will not go there again
3
The food spread was average; definitely nothing much to shout about. Was using 1-1 promotion. Hence it wasn't too expensive for the value paid. But certainly won't visit on the rack rate. The cold dishes include prawns and sushi. The hot selection has rice and dishes. The prawn noodles was good but not for the chicken rice. The dessert selections include durian purÃƒÂ©e
5
Variety and taste-wise, the food is simply great. The breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets were amazing, as not only great-tasting delicacies are served but also the number of dishes. It's mainly an Asian food line-up with a number of continental and European delights rounding up the menu. For one, I truly loved the lobster dish they served, so tasty that I conveniently forgot the name of that menu. The dumplings also tasted amazing. When you're in Singapore, you should not miss this place!!!
3
It's convenient to eat here as a hotel guest, plus they give a good 20% off a la carte or 50% off lunch or dinner buffet. All sounds pretty good right? I had the buffet dinner but was a bit disappointed. Food varieties were small, lots of package tourists eat here, making it look like a canteen. I entertained my Muslim friends here as the restaurant is certified Halal. Other than that, it's not a place I will visit for special occasion. It is average at best.
3
A group of us met on Friday to have dinner here, whilst the deal was good, promotions on certain credit cards- 1 for 1, the venue was very average. It felt like a retired old restaurant, in desperate need of a renovation! The food was so so, nothing special and nothing that tasted well. The layout was tight and it appeared very busy! I still prefer the straits at hyatt and honestly we just went to lunch at aqua at marina mandarin and that was so much better. For lunch they had the same promotion 1 for 1, so it costs the same, however the quality of food was much better. Saying that, if you like the furama for some reason, then go to riverfront, kintamani is much better value and quality
3
Seafood is fresh. Salmons are yum. Other dishes not much difference from the same price range restaurants. A bit surprised not much choice in dessert.
5
The food were delecious and unique. its kinda a like expercience in eating in the restaurant. Its my pleasure to recommend this all to you guys out there! Long live Tiffany cafe! Filipino chef and staff
3
OK selection but nothing to stand out,bacon was a beef one and very dry, pastries were a bit dry and tasteless. Got a bit boring after a while.
2
Pretty normal.. Price cheap, but so does quality of food, the place is 80s,,seems super dated, unless u r hotel guest, see no point to go there for a decent meal.
3
we had a department dinner as we availed for one for one dinner from the credit card promotion. its crowded. we reserved 20 seats but was given a long table and the 6 chairs was in another table with the post in the middle. not an ideal table i should say. difficult to converse with your colleagues if this is where you are seated. food choices limited. i only appreciate the dessert
4
Went with my family for Father's Day, was a little taken aback with the variety of the buffet spread. Thou was limited, I would say the food was good. No complains that the food was tasteless, horrible or what so ever. Those with sweet tooth should try the Durian Pengat, Meringue and the Chocolate Fondue, yummy... Food was promptly replenished, without much waiting time to get your dishes on your plate
2
Made reservation for dinner on 7May 2016 in advance since we are coming for 17 pax..was reminded so many times to make payment. They dun accept payment via phone so I need to come down personally just to make the payment in April. We used to come here yearly with our late mum to celebrate her birthday and mother's day with all my siblings.On 7 May, we are given separated 4 tables by Desmond saying all the tables have been reserved...WHAT? Then why ask for advance payment if such allocation are given....insisted to have a long table so we can have dinner together (its already rare to gather all of us for dinner in a table since mum's gone)took him so long to get back to us. In the end the was given the table we wanted. Food ..not much variety...but the desserts was good. There's a tale for the kid's to decorate their cupcake for the mums
5
This restaurant serves buffet dinner which by far has been a great deal for me and my friends. The food is good alongside with the lobster and the fresh cold cuts. Salmon was fresh and it was tasty. The dessert counter was the best part of our dinner as they had great tasting dessert+cakes.Overall it was a good restaurant. One downfall of the restaurant was the the plate kept running out, and not being replenished
4
Made my reservations since there is a 1 to 1 credit card promo. Told them to surprise my hubby since we are celebrating it in advance. Good spread of asian fd but wish they cld have more. A slice of heavenly choc.cake with a lighted candle together with Mr Anand & his team singing Birthday song came to our table...what's more! A nice complimentry picture taken & framed for us! TQ so much Anand & team! Great job!

If you're here for the 1-for-1 promotion, it's worth it. However, to pay for the full price when there's no promotions, it's not worth it. Staffs were very friendly but need to regulate the flow of plates and cutleries. Variety of main dishes were limited. Would love it if there's more cuisines provided. The TomYam noodles were also too sour... Cold dishes selection were ok. One plus point of buffet here are the desserts. Desserts had an array of variety, from durian pengat, truffle cake, fruit cake and so on.... Though, I find that the desserts were slightly sweet. There was also chocolate fondue. Would love it if time to time they change their fondue flavors such as white chocolate... Overall, for a gathering it is OK. Would come here again if there's promotions but as stated earlier without the promotions, not worth the price
4
Went there for buffet lunch with my colleagues. the food variety was just nice for me. the dessert choices were great! The service was good as well! highly recommended!

Tiffany's at Furama Hotel offers breakfast included with your stay. The restaurant opens from 6:30 to 9:30 I seem to recall. You better have had a very light dinner because the breakfast buffet is sumptuous as it is varied.
3
We had lunch buffet at Tiffany cafe on 5th Dec. The food was good but not great. The desserts were nice. I liked the salads.
3
Came across the 1-1 credit card promo and decide to try the buffet lunch on 1 of the Sunday few weeks ago. Using this promo, yes the buffet was worth it. They have 2 seating areas. Inside the buffet hall area and just outside where the desserts are where the seats are the sofa type and quite cosy. They have nice selection of salads, mains and desserts. The durian pengat was great!. There was not much international dishes for the mains. It was more of an asian/local dishes during my visit. They have nice selection of desserts of cakes, ice creams,fruits as well as fruit cocktail. The staffs were also attentive. Overall it was a great experience for the kind of offer we paid and enjoy the variety of food in a hotel environment
4
Went for their 1 for 1 buffet lunch. Value for money. They have 1 for 1 buffet lunch and dinner promo for various credit card.They have fresh salmon and cold prawns and sushi for their cold appetizer. They have various hot dishes and soup (I didn't take as not to my liking). Few dim sum options too. What I like most is their deserts. I like the durian pudding and cup cakes
3
My family consisting of 8 adults went for their buffet dinner. There was a 1 for 1 promotion. For that price, I find it worth but for it's normal price, it's not.Taste:Very average. Nevertheless, they got one of the best durian pengat. Ambience:The exterior feels better than the interior. We were seated outside and it feels better. The sofa looks newer and were arranged in a better seating structure compared to ones inside.Would I do a return visit?Yes for a gathering sake with the 1 for 1 promo but No for the quality of food served
4
We spent a week at the Furama City Centre so had breakfast at Tiffany's every day. The food was an open buffet of eastern and European food which was very good. The eggs and omelettes cooked on the spot to order and plenty of fruit. We also had an evening meal which was also an open buffet although they did have a comprehensive menu What I disliked the most was that even though Singapore is not a Muslim country they do not seem to serve pork products. So they had chicken sausages, turkey ham and beef bacon instead of the real thing, which wasn't quite to my liking so I stuck to the eggs, beans and hash browns. Their waffles and maple syrup was delicious. The only other problem and a small one at that, is that their Ying Yang condiment sets were always out of salt.However the staff were always polite and friendly and the food was well presented
5
The breakfast buffet was included in our room rate at Furama City Centre. The buffet was fabulous with so many varieties of food available.I am a FUSSY eater and have a lot of foods I cannot eat - so I loved that Tiffany CafÃƒÂ© could cater to my fussy tummy!Great service and friendly staff - all food very fresh and hot. Recommend Highly

We had an awesome dinner here at Tiffany last Monday..The buffet spread was very nice and we really enjoyed the "Duiran Desert".It was super yummy..We was attended by Mr Anand who had a pleasant look and gave us an excellent service by smiling face all the way.He was very helpfull and he really did a good job.All of us was very happy and of couse will be back again.:
5
We had dinner on the 19th of october for a birthday celebration. We were taken care of by Anand the restaraunt executive who was very pleasant and friendly to us the entire night. I was very impressed by the service he provided us with such as talking to us politely, making sure the table was neat and clean. The quality of the food was amazing, there was a huge variety of different types of cuisines and the food was replenished very often. Compliments to the restaraunt executive and the staff
