Not as aesthetically pleasing as many other food centres, and often a little untidy, but the place is massive and contains every type of food stall you could ever imagine at rock bottom prices. Despite the size, it was still difficult to get a table in the days running up to Chinese New Year.It was also very convenient for us walking from Havelock Rd into Chinatown, and we ended up visiting half a dozen times during our Singapore stay

I’ve been to Singapore quite a few times now and this is my number one place I always come back to. It’s the most amazing food and there’s such a variety of cuisines. You can go for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There are so many different food stalls so you can truly embark on a culinary exploration.There is mainly Chinese style food but it is also possible to find Indian, Malay, Indonesian, Korean and Muslim food. At night there’s lots of people there playing Chinese chess and having a few beers or tea.It’s a must when in Singapore!

If you can’t find a good and authentic Chinese meal here god help you. Cheap, crowded and friendly. Whole fish, dumplings,all kind of innards to the standards plus large beers for S$5. Take exit C from the Downtown line at Chinatown and start to explore....worth the effort

There are many of these food courts in Singapore and its easy to get confused. The locals seem to call any of them Hawker Centers but that is technically wrong and not always helpful in finding one. We were misguided several times.Generally they are cheap, fast, good places locals grab lunch or dinner with a large selection of specialized food stalls making stuff fresh as it is ordered. Follow the locals. I had a plate of duck and rice for $3 singapore dollars! We found a unique mango sorbet/custard dish for $2 that I loved and ate 3! Soup is a huge bowl for very little

Stopped off at this fairly dirty and crowded hawker centre on the weekend for a carrot juice. on the plus side it was cheap, at only $2. But on the down side this place really isn't that clean - you need to take care sitting down that the seats haven't been splattered. I won't be rushing back

Ma La (麻辣) is a spicy and numbing sauce originating from China, particularly the Chong Qing and Si Chuan region, which has now found a home in Singapore. Consisting of chilli pepper and various herbs and spices.My all time favourite stall 「日日紅」located at People’s Park Complex Food Centre, which is superb. You may pick from the selections of vegetables, meat & seafood ranging from sgd1-3 p/item (unlike some places charge according to weight), as well as choices of spiciness level + Low salt, less oil & no MSG request! M Lovin’ it

This is an alfresco eating place where the best way to enjoy the food is to dress down to your slippers , shorts and tshirt cos it can get humid while eating there . There are lots of local Singaporean dishes such as roasted meats , fried char kuay teoh, frog porridge , wanton mee etc. But my all time favorite would be the Gong Bao Frog leg porridge. The gong bao sauce is spicy and savory and the porridge is thick and luscious. Perfect pairing in my opinion. What's good from the "non local Singaporean" selection is the "Ma La Xiang Guo" where you can find a couple of stores selling this self - choosing stir fry type of food where you can choose from different levels of spiciness. My personal favorite is located in the middle of the stretch of the stalls facing McDonads. I find their use of spices / sauce less bitter and more fragrant when compared to the more popular store located at the start of the same stretch .

Ok, need to admit that the place is oldish, loudy and not too clean. You still should not make your judgement through this.The place is full of great full stalls. If you want to have authentic malay or chinese food, this is place to go.I had dinner here few times. Both were good, but the laksa I had, was probally the best I have ever had.Take your time. Make few rounds around the stalls and pick what you want. Prices are bargain. Beer is prettt cheap as well. Large Tiger is between 5 - 6 sgd

If u want to get the real authentic Chinese home made cuisines, then it's worth it to try. Otherwise go elsewhere as the place would gives u headache if first time goers. Too many crowds & talking loud honking each other. As u finished eating better get away fast as someone would standing beside u waiting for the tables & seating. It's a no place for biz meeting or chit chats place. Just eat & go....

Workers, students, drunkards and a handful of mentalky ill residents from the HDB upstairs - local enough for you?A stone's throw from the so called tourist traps of Chinatown, PPC has real Sichuan dishes that will send many tourists back to the comfort of the polished SG facade of the quays.If you choose to eat here, know what to expect - the mainland Chinese side of SG, warts and all
