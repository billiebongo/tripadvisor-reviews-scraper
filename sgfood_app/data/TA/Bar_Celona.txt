Had dinner here on New Year's Eve. It was lovely. Very reasonably priced cava, which is a miracle in Singapore! The tapas was lovely as you can order lots of fabulous food to share and savour all the flavours.
5
Everything was so delicious!! We had the best truffle fries and truffle camembert baked cheese I’ve ever tasted! The tapas was so good that I wanted to order everything! And the churros with chocolate was the best way to finish our dinner!! Must go!!!!
3
The ambience is nice. The lady waitress is very friendly and we were well attended to. Food is not great but ok. Don’t have the authentic taste.
4
Repeat customer and always satisfied. Staff remembered my fav version of cava and food choices. Staff are always inviting and giving a true sense that you're not just another customer. That's the true Spanish hospitality on the shores of Singapore!
4
The waitress was very attentive and was always prompt on serving us. Food was pricey but the quality was decents and the amebience was great.
4
Friendly staff, fabulous food, especially like the octopus which is done just nicely. Not forgetting yummy cava. What's not to love?
5
My friends and I went there for dinner on Friday. We were seated indoor where we can chit chat comfortable over the nice music. The food were great and the wine are even more fantastic. The staff serving us was very helpful and friendly and we have a great time there. Will definitely go back there again and again

I come here quite often, the setting is very nice, the cava is cheap and good, food is consistent, and the staff is mostly very nice and attentive, but there is one American manager who always seems somewhere along the spectrum of pushy to rude, even as a large group on a seemingly quiet night. I am very patient when it comes to gruff waitstaff as I realize it's a difficult job but there is an attitude here that I have never experienced in Singapore and it does not fit at all with the vibe of the restaurant otherwise

I've been to Bar-Celona at least three times before, possibly more, and have always been impressed by the food and the cocktails here. This visit - again the food was amazing. Everything we ordered was so tasty. We then ordered dessert and thats where everything went wrong...We ordered Churros. After 20 minutes, we were told there'd be a delay. We were okay with that. After 35 minutes and then 1 hour we were told "sorry about delay" - never offered another drink. Nothing. Then, after 1hr 15mins, we were told they'd "just sold out" of Churros. You imagine how frustrated we were. This news was delivered by a waiter who seemingly didn't care, his lack of empathy was mind-blowing. We we asked to speak to the manager.....no manager at work. We asked to speak to the waiter we'd had all night, he was apologetic but offered zero genuine concern. All they did was take the Olives off the bill by far the cheapest thing we ordered).....offered a free dessert, the last thing we wanted - just wanted to get out of the place.So we waited 1.5hours between our tapas dishes and then leaving the restaurant, with no drinks, no dessert. A hugely disappointing end to the night and soured my experience of this restaurant completely. The service and ineptitude just can't be emphasised enough. I will not be back

This place has very reasonable Cava bottles, and a nice selection of bottles as well. Our favorite is the Brut version, as the Nature version is a tad on the dry side.Nice selection of tapas to go with the cava, makes this a full night enjoyment
5
Came here with some friends. Love the tapas and they have deals on entertainer app and survival chic which is always good for saving some money. I love the meatballs and the octopus. Can't wait to come back again soon!

Rushed, Rude Staff....Very poor indeed! I witnessed many customers turning up at 11:30 only to be turned away by rude and unhelpful staff.
5
keep coming back for their awesome cavas. the best part? starts from just $26 per bottle. service was fantastic with ever so attentive wait staff who kept our glasses filled despite having finished our meal! highly recommended!
4
Went there with a Friend that has never tried cava before : the menu offers a wide range of cava, from sweet to dry and even rose, hence the perfect place to find your favorite cava! Loved the menu and tried a big portion of it :) my favorite are the fresh and tasty figs & goat cheese toasts and the AMAZING marinated baby scallops
4
To be honest, what draws the crowd at Bar.Celona is probably the cheap cava, rather than the food.Love the simple deco and decent spaces in the restaurant. Tapas selection is limited but fairly decent amd consistent quality.If you are looking for a chill out place without burning a hole in your wallet, this is a good recommendation
4
We only popped in for a drink before eating dinner across the street. All they serve here is Cava and a few cocktails, which are quite creative and delicious. Tapas menu looked appealing as did plates passing by. Will do some munching here next time in Singapore
3
Wines are taken straight from vineyard in catalan, therefore great price tags! But the food selection was average. Jamon platter was expensive at 38. Garlic Prawn was good. But the rest did not seem to look too " spanish" . Chicken kaarage and fries are put under " hot tapas" ... fusion perhaps?
5
I had been to Bar.celona a few times and decided to have my birthday celebration there. Sonny and the rest of the crew really took care of us...all 16 of us!!! We had plenty of scrummy dishes to eat and the cava was flowing for the 4 hours we were there!! The food is so delicious and you can overdose on cheese balls! The prawns, the figs, the dips, the beef!!! We began at 7pm when until 8pm we got 1 for 1 (2 for 1) cava cocktails and I had several passion fruit ones.We all had a lovely time!!Thank you again Hasta luego

This place is always busy when I walk passed in the evenings, so I was pleasantly surprised when friends invited me to join them there for dinner. TripAdvisor has only 1 review on the place and it just talks about smoking outside, great for smokers not so much for the rest of us, either way I don't really care, so I thought I'd write a more expansive review.We ordered a huge selection of tapas to share and got stuck in. Some highlights- Very good meatballs, An open beef sandwich, garlic prawns, ham croquets, some great cheeses on the platter... as a group of 6 we tried a lot and happy tore up hunks of bread to soak up the sauces. In short, the food is great. They pitch the bar as being a Cava specialist, and I enjoyed a Cava cocktail, but we mainly drank sangria. It is shipped in ready prepared in a btl, but tasted ok, if a little sweet. I'd have preferred their bartender, who made good cocktails, to have made his own pitchers.The venue itself is lively, a good hustle and bustle of guest, mainly groups on the Friday night we were there. The staff looked after us well, keeping the plates and drinks coming quickly and easily.Overall, a good place and for me, definitely worth revisiting.

Decided to find a decent tapas restaurant which is not too crowded and away from the city, so we settled on Bar.celona (new name after rebranding). Unfortunately, food was poorly executed and at times, served lukewarm even when the place is not even crowded. Iberico Pork was way under seasoned and cold when served. Jamon platter was fairly pathetic. Sauteed Prawn wasn't well executed either.Saving grace is the cheap cava... really! For $28 bottle of cava, it is a steal in Duxton Hill area. My suggestion.. just go for the drinks
5
Cava priced at around SGD30 per bottle, tapas menu which is also reasonably priced and nice food, great smiling staff; everything was perfect for a great night out :)
3
Food is not bad at all but do not expect anything fantastic. Some waiters are really friendly, others so so. The place is noisy inside.
5
Such a romantic, intimate and cool place. Outdoors and undercover and the cheapest Cava you will possibly get in Singapore. Very attentive service and lovely food.
What more can you want? Highly recommended to you.
5
We went here because of an entertainer voucher but we were so delightfully surprised !!! Great food. Great service and great ambience !!
4
This place is pretty good value if you like cava. Pricing for the drinks is very reasonable by Singapore standards. Food is also quite decent and the service is friendly.
4
Best to make reservations instead of walking in to ensure good seats. Tapas was delicious and I had the BEST sangria of my life here. Absolutely delicious sangria! A must order.

You should not allow people to smoke at the tables outside. You have such a beautiful exterior - however, when one person smokes, they end up influencing the taste of the food and the general experience of everyone around them. While it may not be illegal, you should make a business decision not to allow people to smoke at those tables.Although we enjoyed the food and the drinks, we will never again return because we don't want to breathe other people's smoke
5
I've been here three times now and it's always great fun. The staff are super cool and relaxed, always ready to serve with a positive attitude. I love the spanish tapas dishes - octopus and meatballs are my favorites here. We tried the beef cheeks but it tasted a bit gamey for me (I'm 80% vegetarian somaybe the taste of meat no longer sits well with me). Thanks to the entertainer app we saved some money here. Will definitely be back

This was my third time here and the staff are always warm and friendly. Sat indoors once but the alfresco seating with fairy lights and all, makes for a nicer place to chill. Used the entertainer app to get 2 for 2 tapas. Note to self: It's not enough for 2 people. Should probably get a main or an extra tapas dish. For this meal, we had the Chicken Karage (which exceeded expectations) In my mind, I was thinking oily, fried pieces of chicken that you can get 3 for $1.5 at pasam malams, Had to eat my words, and delightfully so because the chicken was well-flavoured. What sorcery, Idk. And it didn't make me feel guilty the way KFC does. Had the grilled prawns again. Good. As well as truffle fries (normal) thought great if you like thick cut fries. You could call them slabs of well-seasoned potatoes too. Our last dish was the beef cheek, Nice, tender - it was like eating a steak you didn't have to cut up. Great for lazy people like me

Came here on a Saturday night with the boyfriend and was quite delighted to find such a gem in the middle of Singapore's city. You wouldn't think you were in SG with the ambience and decoration outside. Food was good although we didn't manage to try much. Drinks are cheap except for beers which my bf ordered. I liked the Sangria and priced at $7.50 it was quite a steal! We were lucky we had booked a few hours before as we found out they were fully booked indoors when we reached but managed to snag a place at the bar as it was a warm night outside. Do book early if you are coming with a big group, but generally this place is not for groups bigger than 6.
2
The place is nice and the food was ok. But we ordered "tapas" and waited for more than 30' for each one, how on earth is that possible!?!
The cava was good and the staff is friendly.
Speed up guys!
5
Great service staffs. Super friendly and willing to go extra mile especially Ivan whom we had great time with.
5
it's my 5th visit and the service and food never fails to delight us!! Definitely worth a visit if you are with groups or a couple!!!
5
Love the atmosphere and food here! Friendly staffs that remembered us! Definitely coming back again!
3
Excellent service! Food wise...still have room for improvement.
Ambience is perfect.
Restaurant great for small/big groups
4
We had a party of 6 and the restaurant was busy and the food came out a little slow, but the manager was on top of it, updated us regularly and served complimentary drinks. Will definitely go back as the ambience and food are excellent!
4
My go to place for Tapas and Cava. Good service; friendly staffs. Cosy environment; good for chilling out with friends.
4
Overall experience was good, with good atmosphere and service. Food was really good, except don't order the paella. The paella came out after everyone else at our table had finished eating and was not worth the wait. The seafood in it was sparse and most of the muscles weren't open. The rest of the food was good, with the beef cheeks a standout - will be having them next time
4
Highly recommend La Champaneria for its decently priced cava (by the bottle) which doesn't compromise in taste! Tapas selection is small but adequate. Main course can be furthered improved as the seafood paella seems to be undercooked. Chicken wing is nothing to shout about, but biggest issue is the sauces are put into a narrow saucer which makes it difficult to dip into. Service was prompt and warm.
3
the cava is cheap and cheerful with a bottle starting at $26, but the less which is said about the food, the better. but I'm going to say a little anyway - paella, undercooked; nachos, covered in plasticky cheese sauce; octopus, saw better days about a week ago. but hey, they warmed the pitas nicely! also expensive for the portion sizes.
5
Great atmosphere, drinks and food! My friends and I never fail to have a good night at La Champaneria. Have been here many times and will keep coming back! The Chili Crab dip is amazing
5
Great food and service by waiters. The cava selection is varied and fantastic value for money for food and drinks!

Went there with a large gathering last Friday. Were outside and was lovely. Food is nice, nothing really special, tapas style with some nice twists. French fries with truffle...interesting even though they we all sticking to each other. Nachos were average and with the ambiant humidity became quickly soggy. Dips are nice. The cava was decent even if they ran out of the reserve we were having after our third bottle. Had to go for the basic cava which wasn't nice. Friendly waiters in general.
2
I've been to La Champaneria a number of times and always enjoyed the food and cava. Unfortunately last night was disappointing. We were unable to sit outside due to the fact that there were so many smokers - yuck! We relocated to an inside table and throughout the meal had to listen to loud 50s American diner music, really painful! Luckily we counted our dozen oysters as there were only 10. We waited 20 minutes for bread that we were told was being baked. It eventually arrived and was very average store bought foccacia sliced like toast! Flavours of the other food was good but everything else was truly disappointing on this visit
4
We were a party of 6; 4 adults and 2 three year olds. The staff were quite understanding when the little ones got excited, and kept an eye on them as they ran around outside (one of the reasons we chose the venue as the road is pedestrianised).The other reason we went was because the food is very well done, the cava choice is wide and superbly tasty, and the pricing is very good. We had a 'nature' cava which is drier than average as no added sugar is used. I'm not sure if you can find this elsewhere on the island.We had too many dishes to name, but the foie gras on brioche and the beef cheeks main course were standouts. Grumbles were minor: I'd appreciate some 'normal' bread offered (i.e. cut baguette rather than only having thinly sliced toasted bread, though that was very tasty, we had to order several when the kids got into eating them) and the paella, whilst packed full of seafood goodies, should have been bigger with more rice.We had a lovely time there, have been before and will definitely return. For a Saturday night I was surprised there were not more guests, I do hope that isn't a sign of trouble. For lovely food and specialty wines at a great price (we had three bottles at less than the price of one from Lolla) I would expect it to be packed.

A nice cozy restaurant tucked away in Duxton Hill. I went there specifically to try the cava. It is definitely the cheapest cava one will ever find in a restaurant in Singapore. If you are not sure which cava to try, the staff was quite willing to let you try them first. We had the Cava Brut Nature, which was nice and not too dry. Great value for S$30/bottle!!! I believe they change their food menu very 3 months. Our party of 3 had fresh oysters (fresh & juicy), jarmon platter, the smoked sprats fish dip with rye coutons, baked figs with blue cheese prosciutto, smoked salmon on rosti, garlic prawns and seafood paella. I must say I was pleasantly surprised by their tapas. They were good and not your usually tapas of chorizo, black ink squid etc.I hope the restaurant will be around for a long time. Restaurants in Singapore have a challenging time with the high rental and cost of labour so most restaurants don't really last long or they have to keep moving to look for more competitive rental to survive

Fab little place in such a great location. The atmosphere was great, service was great and the bubbles was so well priced we ended up drinking 2 bottles!! Tapas was good, but portion sizes on a few options was very small. The mains looked good, and I think we will try them rather next time we go
3
Good food. I reserved indoor seat but they give me outdoor. Overall okay, just next to our table very noisy And keep smoking.
4
Really delicious truffles fries with real truffles sprinkles! Foie gras steak was awesome too! But service was alittle slow
4
Very nice place on a very good location that is becoming the hottest nightlife area of Singapore. Very good tapas, good champagne. Paella was more of a good Risotto than Paella. If you are after Paella choose something else (the sea bad for example... Very good!) or stay with few more Tapas
5
Celebrated girlfriend's bday here was the best decision ever! She enjoyed the food and drinks, especially the fresh oysters! The staffs were superb and even brought her a bday lava cake with singing and music!
Highly recommend the Fresh oysters, Chilli crab tapas and Cava.
5
Fab food and great waiter service at this little tapas place! Was not expecting much from the food, but was pleasantly surprised that it was able to compete strongly with it's surrounding competitors!
4
Great place to be for Irish oysters and if you can hold your liquor, then order a bottle of cava. The rest of the menu enhances the experience, but if you're there to gorge, there's better value elsewhere. All-in-all, a great place with atmosphere to hangout for the evening
5
This is such a lovely place! The setting - nestled along Duxton Hill - is beautiful. I’d recommend you to go there at night, start with a drink - (their specialty is Cava - delicious Spanish sparkling!) - and order some food to share! When you arrive you’ll see all these little lights in the trees surrounding the terrace, which helps the good atmosphere! The CAVA cocktails are not too pricey and quite refreshing, made only with fresh fruits. I went with a big group of ladies and tried the ‘My passion’, a mix of cava and passion fruit and it was delicious. They also have a nice selection of tapas, including some incredible truffle fries, a nice charcuterie platter, and yummy garlic prawns, which are perfect alongside the cava. Definitely a great place to grab a drink (or 3) and an easy dinner and chill with your friends or colleagues! Staff is friendly and helpful which is always a nice surprise in Singapore
4
Had a great night here last night with a group of friends. The atmosphere, service, food and cava, were very good. If you don't like cava however, your choice is limited! The food was delicious, especially the prawns. The only downside was the portion size. We would have expected more meat on a $35 cold meat platter! Overall though we had a great night and will definitely return.

La Champaneria have been a drinking spot for me since March 2016. This place can make me laze there for at least 3 hours. I mean, I don't get to drink a bottle Champagne for just $26 anywhere in Singapore. It then became a weekly drinking session at La Champaneria.Jamon Platter is such brilliant pairing with Cava - Love. Garlic Prawns have a special place in my heart.Note: It's tourist friendly. :)I love the place so much so that I had my private wedding party there! And the settings were perfect. All my guests eat, drink and merry. My event should end at 10:30pm. But the staff and my guest were so spontaneous, they keep it going till late night. I'm glad to have my party at La Champaneria. Days after the event, my guest thanked us for inviting them to a memorable night.Guys at La Champaneria, Excellent Job
5
Food and drinks were excellent!The Chope app was not though. I placed a reservation in the evening for the next day. Chope accepted the booking and sent me a confirmation. But when I got to the restaurant, they did not have any records of my booking. Good thing they had sofa seats available and we got a table even though we did not have a booking.
1
Had grilled octopus for starters before our friends arrive. It was so bad that we decided to pay n move to another restaurant . Chef did not apologise but told us it's frozen octopus.
2
Met a Friend at this place ! We wanted to visit a Spanish tapas place - other than el tardeo, FOC ...We ordered a bottle of their most expensive cava - and had a glass each. I did not even drink more than 2 sips ! It was awful .. We left the bottle as is. We ordered some bread with dips, prawns and some nachos. I feel un well and so does my Friend! The prawns were not fresh it seems ...Some one did come and speak to us and offered desert wine or a glass of wine ... But the point is we left the bottle of cava as is ! Not going back !
5
We celebrated my partner's birthday and the manager was lovely enough to drop me a call and ensure that all arrangements were made upon reservation. The food was lovely, and the ambience was great! Only thing to improve on, the service could be a tad bit better - staff weren't able to provide information about wine, and didn't let us taste it before pouring out the bottle. Our main was brought out one minute after one appetizer was out, and our second appetizer hadn't reached the table yet.But besides that, lovely! Would definitely recommend to others
