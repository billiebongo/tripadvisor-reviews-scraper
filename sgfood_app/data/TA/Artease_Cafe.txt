Visited the outlet at Raffles Place and had the Apple Rose Tea with Pearls. Didn't add any sugar since its flavourful enough. Really nice and refreshing even if without the pearls and sugar. It is supposed to have detoxifying effects as well.

Artease is a great place for quick bites and drinks. My favourite item from them are their grilled cheese sandwiches, they are really good and I'm craving for their honey mustard chicken sandwich right now! Drinks are affordable and it's great for a hot and sunny day in Singapore. Would definitely recommend this place to friends from overseas

We stayed at the hotel opposite Artease Tanjong Pagar and needed a quick bite for brunch. We bought 3 of the sandwich sets - 2 ham and 1 egg, with the hot teas and a coffee. Both service and the food were excellent, and also very reasonably priced for the area. We were so happy with the food that we took away 3 more sandwiches for out trip to the Zoo. My 19 month old baby also enjoyed the food. We have already planned to return tomorrow. I love cafes like Artease which sell a simple food and drink, but do it very well. We will certainly be coming back whenever we visit the area.

I get my quick dose of milk tea when I was in Singapore at this place. And I must say, I love the mini pearls. They offer different flavors of milk tea and coffee. The place can be improved though by providing a closed environment where book readers or students can hang out, without being distracted by the noise from the streets
