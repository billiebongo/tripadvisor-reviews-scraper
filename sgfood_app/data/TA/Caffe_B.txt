Went with my ex-colleague for a dinner and used the Entertainer app. The pasta and panna cotta that we ordered was delicious and we had a good time!
5
Great restaurant in Marina Bay Sands. The portions are small but the food is delicious. I had the tomato soup, lamb and chocolate mouse and it was all yummy. The wait staff was very tentative to our large group. No complaints at this restaurant.
5
The waygun bolonhesa is very good. And the calamari are the best ones I ever had. The view is beautiful over the bay.
3
Food was good, though the meal sizes were quite small (except for the pizza). Good menu. High prices reflect the location. This place has nice views for the water show. 3.5/5
3
We went there for lunch and ordered 2 set menus. One was the normal set while the other was the executive set lunch. Food did not really justify the price.
5
We were a group of 12 pax and had a dinner on friday evening. The GM (Michael) had reserved the upstairs loft area just for us and it was great ambience and good food as well. The Manager (Shahri) and his team took good care of us , considering we had some overseas guests , we felt like we were in very good hands. Italian Food with an asian twist. Cant go wrong. We will be back , that's certai

Prices are abit on the high side, but is to be expected in such a posh venue. Food was reasonably good, 3.5/5. The place had really good atmosphere. But we were probably there on a bad day as there were only 2 staff available and response and service was a little slow
4
Service staff is excellent with smile which is a rare find. Food is simple yet tasty at medium price range. Sofa table facing the sea with nice music and section for smoking is available. George the manager is forever friendly and give great service. During our few visits, All staff are pleasant and accommodating. Sad to hear they will move out to Chinatown area next month. Keep up the good wor

Went here for a drink with my boyfriend while waiting for our table to come up down the road. The staff straight away greeted us with smiles and showed us to a seat at the bar. On asking for some advice on a wine they offered me a sample and straight away we knew this was going to be a good experience. Especially after absolute shocker we had at Lantern at Fullerton on the Bay earlier in the week.Wine and service were so good that after 45 mins we decided to stay there for dinner instead as we has spied some delicious traditional looking pizzas coming out for some other patrons. Right decision! In a nutshell - kudos to George and his team of helpful, courteous, efficient and friendly staff. We were looked after by two servers, George himself and another colleague behind the bar.Food was lovely - most authentic Italian I've has in Singapore and considering the location you would expect astronomical prices and poor quality but this was anything but. Spectacular view, great Latin music playing at just the right volume, lovely set up and comfy chairs - and service that is the best I've experienced in Singapore in the 8 weeks I've been here.Well done guys - you are a shining light in Singapore tourism!(Don't go down the road to the Gordon Ramsey place - they try to herd you like cattle out the front even with a reservation, and it looked really squashed and dark inside.

I am a professional photographer from the US that just arrived in Singapore for a photoshoot and I stopped by Caffe B tonight. I sat at the bar expecting to have a few drinks before heading out for my first night in Singapore. Unfortunately after sitting there for over 15 minutes, not on my phone, or speaking to anyone I could not get a bartender to get me a drink menu or even speak to me. I smiled at multiple bartenders and waiters and they just ignored me. 15 minutes after I sat down I gave up and walked out. I honestly felt like I was invisible to the staff of Caffe B. I travel a lot for work and I honestly don't remember the last time I've sat at a bar for even half as long without at least being greeted. There are plenty of options for food and drinks around Marina Bay so skip Caffe B and go somewhere else that will appreciate your business.
4
The food and ambience was excellent to celebrate our colleague's upcoming wedding. The staff were really lovely. Just need to allow the time to eat the 3 courses.
4
Came here today for the set lunch: 3 courses at $25++. Fairly quiet place without much atmosphere, but the food was decent and the service efficient. Good value for money.
4
Good value lunch menu served reasonably quickly for a party of 7. The food quality was excellent and the value for money equally so.
5
The food was perfect, combination of Italian and Japanese cuisine. The staffs were friendly and accommodating. You can choose variety of best wines. The Bar opens at night located at the upper level of the Restaurant. I was there last March 2014.
5
I brought my two undergrad sons to this restaurant. We chose the 3-course set lunch which cost around $30 per person, after tax. Excellent service from the one and only service staff in the restaurant. Keep it up!
5
This place is the top of service! Not only did people help move our table, they allowed us to leave the table to go watch the lightshow and trusted us to come back and all with the biggest smile. Most well deserved tip in my life! And on top of that, the food was excellent too!!! Not the biggest restaurant but charming in many ways. Thank you guys and keep it up
2
The ambience was dead and the service was sad. The burratta was great but needed a pesto or rocket leaves or some accompaniment to give it a kick but the cheese platter was okay. I enjoyed the mushroom risotto but it needed more flavour. All in all I think a view of the sands would be better than a brick wall. The food was below par and I would probably not return
5
Went out to Marina Bay to watch lights. No light show for the time being as they are building a new light show. However we found this place while waiting for the show. It's amazing and staff were every so helpful. Food was great and we ordered 4 dishes and shared them. Waygu Pasta was one of the best pastas I have ever had. My wife had Scallops and it was done very different but amazing flavours and textures. Also the view and atmosphere was breath taking. Love this place and would visit it again.
1
We had dinner in the restaurant at B1 once, several years ago. The food was wonderful, yet crazy expensive. But okay, this is Singapore AND it's the Shoppes Marina Bay.They have two locations. The cafe at ground level, facing Marina Bay, of course has the perfect location for relaxed sitting, people watching, while sipping a cocktail and having some bites.We've done that at least 10 to 20 times, over the years, often bringing friends along. But after our last visit and so many-eth huge disappointment we have decided to never go there again.The pizzas there (it is an Italian-Japanese restaurant, for godssake) are just disgusting. Supermarket pizzas and fastfood pizzas even taste better than these ones. Spongy crust and rubbery cheese. Hardly ingredients and tasteless.Cocktails often taste watery.At the end of that last visit I complained about the food and even wrote down a long complaint. Needless to say that I never heard anything about it.This place really is a tourist shakedown place with no love for their customers
3
Had an evening meal here upon arrival in Singapore for the Easter weekend. Portions were miniscule but the quality was good. Service slow and the order of things was back-to-front....salad served 5 minutes before the main meal.....long wait for a beer, even! They weren't that busy....just sort of disorganised. A pity
4
Visited the Caffe B which is on Level 1. We had a lovely table overlooking the marina. Service was excellent. Pizzas were good - 15pc more expensive but it's worth it for the view.
2
Really dissatisfied. Lack of food, way overpriced and low quality. Can't recommend. Service was decent, but in general really bad
5
What a find! So worth the expense-the food was light and so delicious. The decor is very understated and elegant. Sorry don't have food pics-scallop carpaccio was divine and my calamari and salad was equally good.
4
One of the less pretentious places to eat at MBS, with outdoor tables facing Marina Bay and close to the nightly laser show. Good service, reliable food and drinks.
1
We were so disappointed in Caffe Be. We had chosen the restaurant as it was close to the water, but we didn't have any view, just of a brick wall. Where the views are I don't know, as none of the tables we saw had any view other than of a wall. The food was very poor. One of our party ordered chicken and just received a plate of thick cut, chicken breast, no sauce, nothing but chicken. I had the one of only two vegetarian main courses on the menu, pasta. It was more or less a bit of pasta, covered in tomato sauce, with chilli added. Again, disappointing. The food was over priced and sounded far better on the menu than it tasted. I would recommend you avoid this restaurant at all costs
1
(+) Nice ambience and place.(-) Took a very long time for the service staff to attend to us despite being 50 - 60% empty on a Sunday evening. The restaurant does not seem to have enough food to fulfill its orders.Of the main course items - Salmon, Lamb Rack, Chicken, Pork Tenderloin, King Prawns and Wagyu beef, NONE WERE AVAILABLE by 720pm and the only items available were pasta and pizza. The service staff should have clearly advised us that these items on the menu were unavailable right from the start when we were seated, and at the second opportunity when we asked them about one of the food menu items. A good 30 minutes was wasted at a restaurant waiting to be attended to and choosing from a group of unavailable food items
3
We stopped by for desserts and glass of wine. The chocolate dessert was great and so was sitting outside overlooking the light show. However, the service was so pathetic - never got that glass of water that I asked for! Just inattentive overall - it took forever to get a glass of wine
2
Service was sub par and mostly they seemed highly uninterested. The food didn't taste fresh and the carbonara & pizza were cold and tasted terrible. My friend and I decided to go over to DB bistro for dessert as we needed something to redeem our night.
3
Three of us decided to go and try out the lunch set menu at Caffe B one day, and it was value for money at $25 per person. The restaurant was quiet and ideal for business lunches. We ordered the set lunches set, which came with a starter (either a soup or a salad), Wagyu beef steak, and a dessert. I wanted the beef to be medium well for doneness, but it was a bit tough. My friends recommended that I should have gone for medium instead. Overall it was still a pleasant lung experience with nice ambience and a quiet setting.
4
We went there for dinner after watching cirque adrenalineFood- we had the festive set as recommended by George. Didn't go wrong with it. 2 glasses of wine, appetizer, main and dessert. Value price for mbs eateryService- They try to be pleasant and made an effort to walk in and out as diners are sat at different locations. We were sitting along the corridor inside mbs. One of the 4 tables located outside. George did like what I suggested, to call me when there was a table available as we were the second couple waiting for a table, instead of just standing around outside, we could walk around.Location - mbs first levelValue- less than a hundred which is a good deal for mb
4
Set lunch was worth it. Good food at good value with friendly, warm, efficient service in a nice ambience.
4
Staff are very friendly, food was good. We only had 3 mains and drink and it cost $300. Don't bother with the foie gras, not worth it really.
4
Came here for early dinner. Ordered the sweet pizza Nutella which is very unique n nice. The non alcoholic drinks n truffle fries are nice too and the service is good. Price is on the high side as with most restaurants at MBS.
4
We dropped in here for lunch after visiting the Museum. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Food also good for a light lunch.
4
Came here for drinks and sat outside, service was good, drinks a bit pricey but a nice environment to enjoy some peace and the music
5
The foods are good. The services are excellent. The environment is just too perfect for chilling and relaxing.
4
Stopped here for a drink and a pizza before heading to the Grand Prix, staff were helpful, friendly and attentive. Food was fresh and tasty definitely recommend
4
Fine dining or casual dining? It's probably in between.
Food: Good food, well balance flavour.
Value: Well worth the money if you go for the set lunch.
Environment: Very nice, comforting and very welcoming.
Service: No complaints.
4
Lunch set menu was good. We enjoyed the ambience n the friendly staff. On the whole, we had a good experience.
5
it's a good day in this restauant. My wife like the food there. And my children eat too much. it's very convinience to book a reservation on Chope.
5
Having few drinks like beers and coctails. Their cocktails was fantastic and many choices to choose for. Happy hour deals very interesting 20%off the regular price. Will come again to chill out overlook the skyline of Singapore.
2
Smoked salmon WITHOUT bread... 8 tiny mini slices come at an additional SIN $ 3.--!! For SIN $ 22.-- one should be able to expect more...
5
I will like to compliment Chris for the quality of service which made our dining a memorable experience. Thank you!

We went for quick lunch on 21 June 2016, the restaurant only had a bigger group of what seemed to be japanese females (20 of them and they had fun by the noice level they have been talking). The male server what a bit overwelmed, at least if looked that way,he did not present himself in a professional manner.The food order was taking quickly by the colleagues of the waiter, Burata with cherry tomatoes and wild rocca leaves, the hole arrangement was very bland. Our main courses 1. Osso bucco, saffron rissotto, tomato sauce and fresh 2 year old parmiggina. Good colour and great saffron flavour, good bite and rice al dente a bite, but to dry presented, sauce tasteless2. Grilled tuna, caponataTuna overcooked mostly welldone, no kind of moisture on the plate, difficult to finish, Both dishes nothing special and worth the visit of the hotel.Would I return to the restaurant.No at all
1
After asking at lunchtime if the restaurant was busy that night I was informed it was, due to it being Father's Day....... 2 tables were booked!!! I should have walked out then. Myself and my son ordered beef carpaccio as our starter. When it arrived we both asked for balsamic vinegar. We were informed they had ran out. Really!!!!! In an Italian restaurant!!!! Whilst eating our starters our main course's were then produced and sitting 5 yards from us. I was astounded. Seconds after finishing our starters our main courses where put in front of us.... My son's containing balsamic vinegar!! Could things get any worse?? Yes they could. Whilst eating our main courses we were offered the menu and asked for we would like pudding. How many basic errors can a restaurant make?? Never again. Average food and appalling service. Please start listening to your customers.

I impulsively decided to come down to CaffÃ© B on a Saturday afternoon when I read that Chef Masahiko Kobe was there. I thought I would not get a seat because I didn't reserve.Fortunately they do have seats available. I was ushered into one of the VIP room by the Floor Manager! I must say that the service -from the Greeter, the Floor Manager and the Wait Staffs- was impeccable. The set lunch menu was SG$35++ for an appetizer, a Pasta main, a dessert and a cup of coffee/tea. I must say for that price, it was definitely a value for my money. Best $35 I've ever spent on food. The fish appetizer was so fresh and light; even if it looked deep-fried, the oil didn't permeate into the meat while the outside was crispy. The beef was so tender and the fat didn't congealed even after it's cold. Also, the pasta itself, without the sauce was already tasty, I think they boiled it in stock. I would definitely come again if I'm in the area.Cheers,Ria
3
Good food and service, but there is something just not right. The wait staff seem disinterested and at least twice we had different staff asking if we needed something that we had just ordered. There are far better ways to spend your money in Singapore for food and drink...get to maxwell hawkers market or satay St and have huge amounts of food and drink for the same price as here.
2
Bunch of us (2 guys 3 girls ) went for drinks and dinner and the experience (barring the view) was just ordinary. 1. View n location - Fantastic. Overlooking the marina bay and the impressive Singapore skyline this location outside the MBS shopper's is pretty neat.2. Service - plain average. Out of the 3 servers who served us (over like 2 hrs we were there for) only one guy had decent customer service skills while one of them had very little understanding on what he was doing. 3. Food and Drinks - Many beers on the menu were not available and a rude "we don't have that" was the response. The truffle fries we got had no truffle oil flavour in it at all. The chicken wings and the pizza was ordinary. Worst of all, even after having ordered like 15 beers and few food items these guys refused to serve us water! They kept saying we don't service water as a part of our policy! None of us would not go here again until they charge this ridiculous policy and way of communicating with customers.
3
If you want a great view of the MBS lagoon and a few drinks then this a great place. The food however does leave a lot to desire. We were there in a Sunday evening and a third of the menu was not available. The steak was overcooked and overpriced although the pizza was decent. Next time will stick to drinks.
5
I am puzzled by the negative reviews of this restaurant. We ate dinner here and it was delicious. The staff was delightfully attentive - not overbearing but always there and aware. There was nothing at all to complain about. The cuisine is delightfully innovative - a mixture of Japanese spices and sauces with traditional Italian fare. I had the pork tenderloin was was tender, delicious and perfectly done with vegetables cooked exactly right.This place deserves to be visited again and again when in Singapore
4
We sat up in the top bar for both coffee drinks at lunch and dinner one evening.
Nice menu and decent food.
Views from the tables outside across the bay are worth seeing!
4
The location and food is great. The service is also good. a bit pricey but worth the price. Didn't expect the food to be this good (what we ordered anyway)
2
Service here is so poor even though it wasn't busy.
Waiting nearly 30 minutes for soft drinks.
Lasagna was ok. Pizzas were very average.
2
Pizza was poor, pasta was O.K and service was horrid. Took 30mins to get 3 drinks and nobody was even there. A must avoid for its expensive prices.
3
I made several trips to Caffe B it was our starting point for evenings out . I cant review the food as we only had beverages. Based on the marina it offers really rather splendid veiws across the bay . Do take a table outside for this reason alone. The service was sketchy . It seemed to depend on who was on that night. Example i ordered Japanese Sencha tea . Which came in a glass tea pot with japanese glasses complete with tea strainer. I love the process of this drink almost as much as the tea itself. Anyway i digress. The next evening i asked for the same , Waiter flat out said " we dont do it ". It took three more attempts to order it before sucess , I actually had to show him the listing on the menu before he would believe me . No big deal but still. This is a fairly usual experience in Singapore . Locals dont have a very "think outside the box" attitude. Which is due to living a life of rules and regulations and no fault of thier own . If you ask for something, anywhere in Singapore and the answer is no. ask again and even a third time. Politely of course. The food menu although we didnt partake was extensive and the drinks menu which we did was impressive in choice . Its a nice place to stop by and watch Singapore go by.
5
Feels confused with the negative reviews given to this place, because the experience I had was excellent! Service was great and attentive, especially by the asst manager Shan. I'll agree that the food is overpriced but I still think that the taste was good. True, the portion is small but it's fine dining. Usually they serve the food at almost the same time for my family and I, so I guess that's why the wait could be long esp when we all ordered different food. Do note that while the restaurant has a no child policy, children are still allowed in as long as they do not run about.
2
Stopped here for a quick snack only because 30mins earlier the place had been busy,so can't be bad?Wrong!We ordered spaghetti carbonara & calamari fritto,calamari was overcooked,tasteless,& probably overpriced, & the batter was like wet toilet tissue,carbonara had enough salt in it to put your blood pressure through the roof.Yes,the surroundings are good,& contrary to other reviews the service was ok,which stops it getting a 1*
5
I had a pot of tea and some salmons for dinner some times ago after work and I would say this is a perfect place for a after work chillax place for dinner ! I chose outdoor as I love fresh air and the view of the city. the food is really good and sitting outdoor sipping some tea is really a enjoyment for me ^^ definitely be back again for tea and drinks
5
I was a wonderful evening sitting here and enjoying the view to The Fullerton Hotel on the other side of the bay. It's a great place to relax after work. The service was fine. I got lasagna and it was ok. The panacotta was ok as well with the green tea. I can recommend this restaurant if you want to see Singapore from its best side away from Orchard Roads circus
4
We went for lunch and had the set menu which has a choice of two starters and three mains. Food was fine and although not elaborate we felt that the overall meal was good value. Service was attentive and discreet. The restaurant was quiet but this was fine for us. Wine menu had a good choice and we overall enjoyed our experience
4
Went with a friend under restaurant week reservation. Lovely restaurant for a nice and quiet dinner. Great service, totally up to standard. Food was jz average though, but I wouldnt mind going back to try on other stuffs that are on the menu.
1
The food quality was unquestionably below average . All items are over-priced . Not worth it ! Won't go back again . They really have to work on it .
1
I am rating about the quality of the food. No value for money. I am very disappointed!!!! I will never ever comeback at this restaurant or recommend it to my firends and family..
1
Nothing special or exceptional about this place. Italian Japanese influenced cuisine?
The food was nothing to write home about and the service needs a major kick in the pants. Typical Singaporean service. Atmosphere is nice though. Not enough for me to visit again.
2
Beautiful restaurant, nice decor. The service is OK, fairly attentive and reasonably fast. But the food is not OK. Small portions. A bit over-priced. My daughter and I visited Caffe B for pasta the evening before the Singapore Halfmarathon. Really small portions. Over-cooked pasta, not really acceptable pasta sauces. We wouldn't come back
2
Me and my husband went on a Saturday evening after watching a performance at MBS, and at 7pm, there were probably only 4 - 5 tables of guests. We waited 30min for our mains to come and 1) food wasn't warm 2) portions small compared with other restaurants with similar price points 3) my cod was supposed to be "baked cod in mis" but i tasted no miso, in fact, cod was bland and I am someone who isn't heavy on taste actually 4) husband's tenderloin was not restaurantWe ordered the chocolate mousse and fortunately, that did make up for the below average mains. However, i will not return again for the overpriced and below average food
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our family evening here.They made special efforts to provide vegetarian option for me which I excptional as many restaurants wouldn't go to that trouble.The service was very good and the staff entertained our granddaughter while we enjoyed our meal.The only drawback was that the portions were small and very few vegetables to go with the main dish
3
Caffe B is a great place to go and unwind after work, for some drinks or snacks. Great venue good selection and great view. However they need to improve there service and ensure the customer is happy and served. However if you need to go unwind go sit at Caffe B and take in the scenery and the passers by. watch out for the runners when having your second drink
3
If you have a choice don't stop here. The waitresses are pushy, the beer servings are below the standard size, and the price is much higher than anywhere else in the area. The view was the only reason we stayed there for the first drink but we moved down the pier for the second drink at another place
3
Went there for a drink and some snacks on a Friday evening. It was not very crowded, service was good. I like the Surprise Sunrise (cocktail), a very refreshing drink just nice for the evening. Some of the snacks (calamari, pizza margherita) that we tried were good too. Not forgetting their desserts. The tiramisu and panna cotta were delicious
3
Stopped to do some work and enjoy a beer and snacks. How can tortilla chips be difficult? Not sure what the dip was, but tasted like salad cream. First bowl I was presented was solid. Definitely not worth S$15! Fortunately nothing went wrong the beer!
4
Easy walk in place, bar, very comfortable and nice to sit and enjoy Marina Bay view. Also chill with wine and cocktails. They also serve super thin crost pizza with octopus and lots of cheese
4
Atmospheric & elegantly presented, this intimate dining space has a great wine list too. We enjoyed lunch here before a business meeting & our meals were superb & our host attentive & unobtrusive.
1
The service is horrific. It took almost one and a half hour to get the pizzas we ordered. We received neither an apology nor did we get a discount because of this. Although the food is OK, it is definitely not worth the money.
5
An Asian Italian fusion certainly got us curious, there were lots of delicious sounding dishes to choose from, as a fish lover I couldn't decide so the waiter recommended the Cod and it was fantastic, extremely delicious and beautifully presented, my husband hand prawns which were big and juicy in a delicious sauce. The staff were attentive and it was a great experience and would highly recommen
4
We wanted to kill time in the afternoon so we went to this cafe at the Shops at Marina Bay Sands. It's a nice place for chat, coffee and desserts! They have a relaxed atmosphere and you can enjoy the view of the marina. Friendly staff and desserts were very good! Makes me wanna hangout here. It's a bit pricey but hey, everything is expensive in Singapore
4
This little cafe is one of several in the Marina Bay shopping complex. Ate there on a whim one evening as we wanted a quick "snack", rather than a large meal. It proved a good choice as the food we chose were small servings - and priced appropriately - and very well prepared and tasty. Recommended if you are looking for a casual light meal
3
We visited with a friend from the UK and were pleased to sit overlooking the Bay towards the city at this pavement cafÃ©, watch the world go by and see the sunset. However, at least three of the Happy Hour wine options on a restricted listing were not available. How can management get it so wrong
1
Used to bring overseas friends here because of the view and the food wasnt necessarily bad. The service was always mediocre at best, but my experience today means I will never return: I waited OUTSIDE to ask to sit outside with my dogs. Before I could ask, they asked me to leave because of government regulations. So I asked where their boundary was, and asked if I should move beyond it. I then moved beyond the boundary line, to which the wait staff said it wasn't enough and requested that I go further.When I asked the boundary of their restaurant, they were unable to say, saying he didn't want to "discuss lines with me"..when I said "so you just want me out of your sight"? The man said " yes".Demonstrates the narrow mindedness of the staff. Worst service ever. Not coming back. So many better places along the promontory
3
This is a classic example of what is so wrong with tourist destinations, ok views, terrible service and high prices resulting in a totally average experience. Food was ok, service was classically singaporean (terrible) and the view was ok. Wouldnt be in a rush to head back, particularly as there are other, better more tradtional places to eat nearby
1
great to sit out and look over marina bay but avoid the Pizza, very disappointing and service has something to be desired. probably best to consider a drink or coffee next time, if there is a next time
2
Not lucky for the location, stuck in a basement of the MBS mall with no view. The food does not help either: the vegetable tempuras are just deep fried and the 3 small pieces of pork tenderloin arrive 10 minutes after my friends' main courses, not warm enough and not tasty. The sauvignon blanc from New Zealand was excellent but pricey (like all wines in Singapore unfortunately)
4
Having been to Caffe B. a couple of years back and enjoyed myself tremendously with the palatable food, impeccable food and elegant settings, I decided it was time for a revisit - this time with *Charmaine for her birthday. The pillar with wine bottles still greets us at the door, and the interior is still as beautiful as ever.For mains, we took the recommendation of Risotto "Singapore" (SGD$38.00) - chilli crab inspired risotto with giant scallops. The huge arborio grains were chewy and solid, giving the dish a wonderful bite. As for the chilli crab sauce, it was distinctive in flavor and crab's unique sweetness, but not too spicy - even *Charmaine who had sore throat was able to handle it well. The giant scallop was succulent and bouncy in its freshness, the perfect choice for this dish.We also shared the Angel Hair Pasta (SGD$33.00) - consisting of capellini tossed with veal jus sauce, truffle oil, edamame and Hokkaido pan-seared scallop. Imagine springy pasta infused with the rich flavor of veal jus and truffle oil - a very tasteful combination. The juicy scallop and crunchy edamame completed the dish; it was tempting to order another of this but of course we refrained.Finally, we had dessert - Tiramisu (SGD$18.00) - the classic Tiramisu done a la Minute. They were so lovely to serve this as a complimentary dessert because we were celebrating *Charmaine's birthday. The Tiramisu was moist, soft and tasted distinctively of the sweetness of mascarpone cream as well as Amaretto infusing its spongy layers. It was very good, but I was a little saddened it was not the same Tiramisu I had 3 years back, with the biscuit fingers.

Passing through and only having 2 hours in Singapore, we went to watch the light show and take "the photo" of the city skyscrapers, and so afterwards needing a refreshment, had some pizza and hot chocolate. Great friendly staff, courteous to our needs with children and needing a quick meal. The pizza's were light and fresh, and our warm drinks perfect sitting at an outside table
2
Reception - courteous. Service - attentive , friendly. Food - not what we expected. Small portion that were a bit on pricey side. Most of the food - pasta, pizza, steak - were not bad but far from fine. Drinks - small portion. Martini was a disappointment. Probably not coming back.
4
Most outdoor cafes in Singapore feature an amazing amount of foot traffic passing. this one did not. a relatively quiet outdoor area located between the conference center and the bay. We came here as a group of 12 and were served quickly and well. The beers were served in chilled glasses and the pizza was hot. Complimentary French fries for the table too. Pizza was passable, in summary it was a pleasant way to wind down
1
Went to this place for a late lunch when I had guests visiting as other restaurants around were full. I can only describe our experience as very poor. The portions were very small for the price you pay and the food was of bad quality. Ordered a carbonara for $18 and it was literally finished with one twirl of my fork. To make it worse the chef had boiled the pasta so that several pieces were stuck together as one very thick piece of pasta and he could not be bothered to remove it. So much for presentation. My guests ordered the meat option and when it arrived we just laughed. It was a grey looking piece of meat served with two over-cooked pieces of zucchini, floating in it's own jus. The chef had not let the meat sit before it was served and the presentation was probably the worst I have ever seen. The service was unfortunately also lacking as we went for long period of times without even seeing a member of staff and not once did anyone check whether our food was ok.. We also ordered sparkling water but when the waiter started pouring we realized he was serving us still water. When we pointed this out, he asked if it was ok for us to have one bottle of still and the other sparkling and he would add lemon to our drink to make it more like sparkling... Unbelievable.. And this is at $10++ per bottle. Sorry caffe B but I will definitely not be bac
2
Caffe B tried to be high class restaurant but is not succeeding. Very expensive for average food, service so-so (they did not have the natural Singaporian friendliness) and of the 4 dishes we wanted to order, 2 were not available - with only 4 tables filled... Interior not very exciting... Not recommended at all

Great location outside the Marina Bay Sands only to be disappointed by non service oriented manger and chef that does not deliver what's promised.Ordered a few dishes:-1. Special order of Parma ham, cherry tomatoes focaccia bread for a 6 year old was rejected initially by the manager to one of her waiters. I requested a little understanding and the platter proved excellent and my daughter really enjoyed , downside was it required a repeat as it was small. 2. Calamari starter with assorted condiments was good while the " truffle fries" clearly only had trudged oil added. 3. The burrata salad promised rocket and cherry tomatoes, chef offered 2 tomatoes and the rocket was a light garnish. Most unacceptable! 4. The $35 grilled meat option was sold as tenderloin, we ordered two portions. I attach a picture of the Caffe B tenderloin. Not tenderloin! Most unacceptable. Why waste your time at Caffe B, next time I visit I hope it's under new management

This restaurant offers and promotes a set lunch. When we ordered, I forgot to say that I wanted the set. We were busy talking, and ordered quickly. I simply asked for beef, which is one of the options of the set. I did not look at the a la carte menu. After lunch, they asked about desserts. It was only then I realised that it wasn't the set lunch. I expect a good restaurant that serves beef on both its set and a la carte menu to ask the customer which he wants, if not specified. It isn't about cost, but about service. I found that below par. The good was decent. I asked for medium, and it was not pink, but red. Not bloody, so acceptable. Portions are small, which again is acceptable for lunch - but more for a set, rather than for a la carte

Paying S$24 for a glass of fair wine and then having to pay for a very small main serving as small as most entrees eat inside the mall

A very nice location to just hangout with a cup of coffee and some finger foods... You may just sit, talk or read a nice book

Great location, cocktails delicious and very large selection; ice cream cocktails are amazing. Nutella pizza was nice (not enough fruit or Nutella), but base is incredible. Truffle fries a little over fried and oily but still amazing. My sister recommended a dusting of salt for the fries. Staff were lovely, gave us roses at the end of the night. Expensive because of where it is, but that's to be expected

Lunch set menu that's available on weekends as well (which isn't the case for most of restaurants) at 25$ was a steal. Beautiful presentation, excellent food and attentive service. There's no children's menu however splitting a regular meal for our two children worked perfectly. Will definitely go back

Food - we had salmon pizza and calamari. Both below average. Edible but not a great pizza and the calamari was slightly better than packet version. Also calamari delivered when all our party had finished eating.Location - a good location overlooking Marina Bay. We went to watch National Day celebrations and had good view of air activities.Service - varied. A couple of the staff stood out from the rest. Oliver and Doris were a class above. Some were ok and a few were pretty clueless. The guy who took the food order only took orders from two of the four of us. Not sure which planet he was on.Price - food above average price but very expensive for the quality. Alcohol extortionate even for Singapore. Prosecco $100dollars, beers $19/20 per pint. Caught us out with the water $12 per bottle. Total bill $130 each.Overall we had a good night despite the negatives above

Got a treat for my belated birthday celebration here and love the weekday set lunch menu! For S$25++, you've got 3 course with really delicious sundried tomato salad with ponzu dressing and a choice of main course, either wagyu beef tataki or lobster & sakura ebi capellini or grilled seabass in tomato & naganegi sauce and lastly lemon meringue tart for dessert. Most of us chose the wagyu beef that came with mashed sweet potato which is much healthier than potato for main course and were all very happy with the dish. Generally, the menu was very well balanced and cooked perfectly to our taste. The portions might be a bit small for guys who perhaps should choose capellini instead for main course. More fulfilling than seabass and wagyu beef. But the menu is just nice for girls' lunch. The restaurant design is beautiful, fancy but cozy, though not small either. Service was great and they recognized us as staff of the hotel and applied the staff discount before we even asked for it. Overall, would highly recommend Caffe B for lunch and dinners.

We stopped in for a glass of wine before dinner. There was nothing on the menu that we liked so didn't order any food. We were told the Italian wine on the menu was not available anywhere else in Singapore, which was just aswell because it was not good. It was also served in a small wine glass like you would expect if you were in a rugby, football or bowling club and believe me, the tiniest measure, I thought it was just for me to taste it to see if I liked it, I didn't realise that was the actual measure ! It was happy hour and the thimble measure of wine cost approx £9.. There are lots of other restaurants and bistros and bars we were just unlucky in our choices of this particular night

If I pay 65 dollars I want 65 dollars worth.The salad was neutral with too much salt. The sea bass and sea food plate was a rip off. A small piece of fish with 3 mussels and 3 clams and 5 rings of calamari. The rest was soup ( a sort of bouillabaisse red curried soup with 3 croutons)I requested to see the server and asked if there were any vegetables or sides. He said no so he brought a tiny amount of spaghetti for 16 dollars. Who are you kidding? This is not a 1 or 2 or more star Michelin or Zaggat rated. This is a chef with no name pretending he is somebody by ripping you off. Don't go there if you expect to eat.The coffee was really good and the staff was apologetic and understanding as though these comments were known to them. They deserve zero business from you. Finally the atmosphere for lunch was traitorous. A mortifying silence as thought you were in a funeral home. Maybe the chef needs concentration.Ah... Almost forgot. I actually ordered the Venison. But.... They were out of it. The server admitted they had to take it out of the menu for the last few months. Bait and switch... You got to be in Asia to full people like that. Sad. There are so many restaurants in Singapore but always a couple of cons.

average food,expensive prices and the worst service i have had.After our mains were finished and plates taken away we waited for 30 -40 minutes and no one came to check whether we needed anything else.yes i know we could have asked but it was difficult when all staff totally ignored us and would not make eye contact.it was not busy.we should not have to chase staff when it is their job to serve us.Finally got staff to get the manager-he took 5 minutes to come and see us.he was young and out of his depth.took 15% off the bill but this did not make up for the average food and bad service.Very poor considering the price.Beware-there are better restaurant

After going through a few shortlisted locations, the Beau and I decided to stick with Caffe B for a celebration dinner. Having read some reviews about this Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant located at 2 Bayfront Avenue, #B1-15 / #01- 83 The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore 018972, we dialled 6887 3311 for reservations.Yes, the nouveau Italian dining restaurant Caffe B is located at my favorite Marina Bay Sands once again, this elegant-looking, quietly-sophisticated restaurant uses the romantic effect of soft lights and lavishly-dated decor to create an almost quixotically-lovely ambience.Strangely, how many people actually thought that "Caffe B" was a casual-dining concept serving bistro-style food. When I talked to a few people prior to the meal, they had either not heard of it, or formed the above misconception. Well, dearies, let me assure you that it is nothing like that at all.While waiting for the entrees to be served, the warm fluffy foccacia bread with olive dip were being served. The sweet bread was light and the olive dip was delicious, so they complimented each other very well.Then my entree of Squid Ink Seafood Risotto was served - a tiny heap on a gigantic plate nicely dotted with colored spices. The seafood (prawns and scallops) was deliciously bouncy, as was the rice infused with the tasty iodine-saltish flavor of squid ink. The saffon sauce sweetened the dish. This Risotto dish was simply bursting with flavors all around, and every morsel, every grain was a dream.For more detailed information and photos, do check out:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/dinner-at-caffe-b-at-mbs.htm

Nice balcony seats facing to marina bay and it's really charming to have wine in the afternoon. Try.
But don't eat food.

Enjoyed the set lunch at this Caffe B. Service was good. waitress took the time and explained the menu to us. we both chose the pasta and sald and really enjoyed it. The portions were not too large for lunchtime.we enjoyed a glass of prosecco with the meal. All in all it is an OK place to eat. Would eat there agai

Came here to try the Express Lunch at $38++ each for 3 courses. Opted for the soup, followed by the venison pasta, and the very simple ice + lemon flavour dessert (in truth the dessert is not really a full course). The whole experience was pretty average: nothing particularly inspiring but equally nothing especially bad. Not really motivated to try again
1
I ordered the spaghetti carbonara. The portion was small and greasy. The bottom of the bowl was full of melted butter. The worst is that, despite a usually robust stomach, I was very sick the next morning. I have no doubt that the carbonara was the direct culprit so I recommend you stay away from Caffe B

We had lunch at Caffe B. We ordered the Mediterranean Lunch Set, which included a delicious shrimp cocktail appetizer, and a choice of chicken or beef main course. We chose the chicken, which was a beautiful chicken piccata sauce with the freshest pasta I have ever tasted. The lunch included a bottle of red wine, and tiramisu for dessert. Even though we were in Singapore, this restaurant delivered the perfect European Service experience. We had a very attentive server, who watched every move but did so from a distance so as not to be intrusive. When I dropped my knife, before it even hit the floor, he was over at the service station getting a new one for me. Our wine glasses were kept full, and the service overall was just fantastic. We left an extra tip because we were so impressed. We spent two hours there for lunch, but it could not have been a better experience!If I lived in Singapore, I would eat in this restaurant at least monthly

I went to Caffe B at Marina Bay with a friend for lunch recently. They serve a so-called 'business lunch', which includes a bottle of not very good wine, but which is overall a reasonably good deal.Otherwise, the whole experience was characterised by everything going wrong - I could have been visiting Fawlty Towers.I arrived and gave me friend's name for the booking. They sat me down - my friend wasn't there. Two minutes later, someone rushed up and said I couldn't sit in that place as it was reserved. I was happy to move. My friend emerged from the bathroom to see me apparently being led out of the restaurant and leaving. Yes, the table was reserved ... for her and me. The staff returned me to that table.Menus arrived. After 5 minutes, staff assured us our meals would only be about 10 minutes. Interesting. We hadn't actually ordered anything at that point. Oops. We ordered, making different choices from the set menu options. We asked if we could substitute a desert from a different set menu. No.Our meals arrived and we were both served the same thing. We queried it. They rushed off to substitute. Actually, I preferred to stick with what had arrived - it looked fine and I didn't want to restart the wait for my main course. Getting staff back so that we could continue with what we ordered was difficult. They should have stopped apologising and started listening.The substituted desert that they said we couldn't order did in due course turn up. Just as well we hadn't changed our minds.I asked for green tea. Staff said they don't have it, but gave me the menu to choose something else. Ah, I should have asked for 'jasmine green tea, which was on the menu. Didn't matter though. They'd run out.On the other hand, the food we did get was good, the place was good value, and it was very quiet as there were more staff than customers. Better get in quick - I don't think this one is going to be around for the long haul.

We went to Marina Bay to celebrate my son's 6th birthday. We dined at Cafe B (Italian restaurant) in the Waterfront Promenade Terrace area. This provides a wonderful view across the bay towards The Fullerton. My older son said it was the best pizza he has ever had. That huge praise considering what a pizza aficionado he is! The cocktails and mocktails were also yummy. Prices range from $19 to $30. Drinks ranged from $5 to $20 from memory. We walked about twenty meters and watched the Light and Sound fountain show which was directly in front of us at 9.30 pm. It's free and truly wonderful. I have read other reviews stating that you can watch this show from The Fullerton. It's across the bay so the view would not be as good. We had a great night and caught a taxi back to our resort
3
Very overpriced and the service was very slow-was Sunday evening too so was very quiet no excuse really for the slow delivery of drinks. We were at the light show but decided on a drink first, almost missed the show as the drinks took so long..3pints (not full!) of Tiger beer and 3 shots = over 105 SGD. The atmosphere and location is fantastic but based on the prices I won't be returning!

We dined in this place with a voucher. That probably explains why the food portion was incredibly small, but they should at least try to impress us, the new customers, with some mouth-watering delicacies. That would certainly entice us to patronise the restaurant again paying full price. Is it not what marketing through Groupon is all about? Unfortunately, their food just did not make the mark for fine dining. It was just OK. Not great. Not even the bread. Not worth the high price tag.

Once a favourite of ours now losing some of its shine. The menus is a little limited and the service is not what it used to be. The ambience is still there but that doesn't make up for the other shortcomings. We made a reservation for Friday evening. Placing our food order was difficult as the waitress was Japanese (I think). The appetiser order wasn't correct and I didn't get mine. The main course was OK but nothing special and the deserts were small and over priced. My wife reflected that Au Petit Salut at Dempsey is far better

Yummy Italian, mushroom soup was excellent, plenty extras outside the menu on offer and a friendly knowledgeable sommelier to complete the fine dining experience.
5
Very nice upper class place to take somebody you want to impress. The waiters are formal Italian type & the food first class. Its not cheap but not horribly expensive either . Great place to take a girl on a first date.

We wanted to have dinner at MBS before the musical show and eventually chose this restaurant cos it had less people than others at The Shoppes. It was a total disappointment and we would never come back.I ordered a penne dish (just penne and tomato sauce, no veggie or any meat), which cost $18. With 18sgd (excl tax and service charge), I'd expect something that can fulfill my stomach. The portion, unfortunately, was as small as the kid meal in IKEA restaurant. My 2 friends ordered 2 different types of salads (one green and one summer). The funny thing is that one came out 15 mins after the other lolThis might be an okay place for drinks, but food here is a total mistake

Birthday treat thanks to a Groupon deal which was for a 3 Course Fine Dining Set Lunch for two people $78 normal price was $158.We reserved a table which when we arrived we were greeted by the Maître D and shown to our table.The inside of the restaurant was elegantly decorated, bottles of wine behind a glass case which went up to the ceiling, crisp white linen cloth and napkins.Even though we had this amazing offer from Groupon we were not treated any different to their normal clientele, in fact the Maître D was fab, he was Italian which meant he had all the flair.Asked if we would like an aperitif or glass of Champagne to start - Glass of House Rose Champagne was $12, it was light and refreshing, went down really well.While we were choosing our courses we were given a plate of black olive tapenade and home made breads to eat - free of chargeSet menu consisted of 2 starters, 3 mains and 1 dessert.Vine tomatoes with buffalo mozzarella and pumpkin sauce which my husband ate - the best silky soft mozzarella. I had carrot and pumpkin soup - very smooth and creamyMains were: Pappardelle Pasta with Wagyu Bolognese - didn't tryTuna Steak with Vegetables - Very FreshBraised Veal shank with Saffron Risotto - AmazingAll finished off with a homemade TiramisuThe meal was very relaxed, staff were attentive and knowledgeable.I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a "special Occasion" or if your flush with money then every day

I have been viewing the comments of this restaurant here that is quite negative about its food/service/price.Every time I pass by this restaurant at Marina Bay Sand, I always get attracted by its beautiful entrance. Still, I would like to pay a visit, to experience how 'negative' it is by myself. Turn out, I found it is actually decent and I had spent a good afternoon there.My hubby and I had ordered 3 courses set lunch (Worth SGD 106 for two), two glasses of bubble wine (Worth SGD 32 for two). Staffs and service here are nice, both polite and decent.Foodies here are like art. Maybe we are lucky that the ordered dishes looked incredibly fantastic and delicate, tasted also gorgeous! Alcohol is expensive. But I suppose it is more or less the same else where in Singapore! It wasn't much people in the restaurant during Sunday afternoon, we felt cozy. We would still consider to come back. Somehow, we shouldn't judge a book by its cover, should read through it by own, to experience something differently :)CheersDom

If you are thinking of pampering yourself this Valentine's day, Caffe B might be the place for you. This Japanese-Italian restaurant sits a distance away from most celebrity chef restaurants , providing a quiet ambience though one might take some time to be used to the dimly lit brown interior. For full review : www.dairycream.blogspot.sgThe set meal of five courses is based on the Groupon voucher and not all items are available on the ala carte menu. We loved the very nourishingly sweet Japanese pumpkin soup with tomato, with the nutty aroma from the roasted walnuts topped with a piece of fried basilFor the main, I believed our choice of the Argentinian Beef Tenderloin with Marsala (red wine) Reduction was a right one out of the three choices including salmon and risotto. The purple and white pom douchesse are the two spiral shaped things if you can spot them in the picture. They are seasoned mashed potato mixed with egg, squeezed out from a piping bag then baked till golden.Just look at how pink the meat is and you can imagine the tender of the beef was. The meat sat on top of spinach puree next to a sauteed radicchio trevigano, a vegetable which resembled purple cabbage to me. Squid Ink Uni Pasta is a signature ala carte dish which truly stood out from the usual squid ink dishes as the tangy tomato cream balanced the unique smell of the Uni which some people might be afraid of. The Japanese eggplant was sliced into rounds was plain on its own naturally but a perfect match when eaten with the pasta.Check out more items including desserts here: http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/02/caffe-b-japanese-italian-fusion-food.htm

Was there for lunch with my wife. Was given a table by the wall. Place was much smaller than the photos online. Food was average with the exception of the one experimental dish with the foam (forgot the title). Pricey for sure but that's somewhat expected for Marina Bay Sands. There are better Italian restaurants out there. For me - first and last visit. I would rather pay for another outlet which is across the bay near the Merlion.uch better food for the same price range

In Singapore for a family holiday over NYE 2013 And settled on Cafe B as the Menu and drinks looked ok. We paid a $50 deposit to secure a great seat in the far corner to view the fireworks. Though we cannot blame cafe b for the weather (rain) they surely should be responsible for supplying edible food and timely drink service. After spending over $600 (2 adults, 2kids) on what looked like frozen fries, the stingiest ante pasto platter and a couple of ok but sparse home style pizzas we left disappointed, sober and a little hungry! The cafe was disorganised and the bar a shambles (watch for half nips!!). Certainly would not return

The service was great and friendly , but the food was wonderful cooked well , with wonderful presentation of fine dinning , the flambé steak was great and cooked table side, for a fine dinning experience. The price was very reasonable , the food looked like it was cooked by the winner of professional master. Chef , this was a great treat

Visited on what seemed to be a particularly busy Saturday night at MBS and was surprised this place wasn't busier, particularly given the fantastic, fresh Italian cuisine. Extensive food and wine list, and the prices were decent too - dinner and wine for two cost what the same would be for one at one of the MBS celebrity restaurants. In addition to our mains, we were also treated to a lovely amuse bouche that was prepared in front of our eyes with care and precision. It would be a great date night restaurant, and a number of couples seemed to have that idea
