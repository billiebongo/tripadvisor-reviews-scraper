Had a delicious dinner especially the paella and the other small dishes like sausages, ham and cheese which was TOP up by Sangria. Friendly staff and nice ambience .
4
celebrated a friend’s birthday there and the service was amazing. the seafood paella was awesome too!
2
Service was poor. Main course delivered separately. Atmosphere was not great. Food wasn't bad but poor value for money
3
Simple tapas buffet with average food. Service wasn't great.. one of the staff was rather rude. Visit once is enough, unlikely to come back again.
5
The food was well made and satisfying. Enjoyed each of the three we tried. Will definitely visit again.
5
Food was really very good and reasonably priced for Spanish food. Good service and very nice cosy restaurant. Love everything about this place!! Will definitely patronize this place again!!
5
Dog-friendly restaurant (outdoor seating). Staffs are always friendly, very attentive even if you're seated outdoor. Best part... the food never disappoint. We'll always visit this place to celebrate occasions (birthdays, anniversaries) or simply just to satisfy our cravings. Must order:Squid in its own inkGarlic PrawnSeafood Paella (al dente)Oxtail (yums)Hokkaido ScallopsDip the bread in those garlic oil after your garlic prawns

Catching up with a new or old friend over a drink with some lite bites or full dinner - Don Quijote gives you a choice. Located in cozy Dempsey Hills with free parking. The staff was attentive and our orders were promptly taken. We ordered Sangria red - pretty good standard. I am not a big eater for dinner thus went with the hot tapas. We liked the croquette con jamon and the egg plant in a casserole soup based. The atmosphere was conducive for chatting. However, I felt the acoustics could be better managed as when the noise level goes up, it was difficult to listen to my dining companion. Would probably return to try the desserts - churros.
5
My husband held a surprise birthday party for me at Don Quijote for about 60 persons. The owner Ken went out of his way to source for the cake, balloons and the band! Ken is a foodie, so he really puts his heart and soul into the food preparation. Everyone, from 1 year old to 70 years old, enjoyed the night. As expected, the garlic shrimps, green beans, paella and sucking pig were great. We have never tried the roast beef prior to the party and one of my friends said the roast beef was one of the best she has had. Definitely our favourite Spanish restaurant in Singapore. The atmosphere is laid back and you feel like you are eating with family.
3
This was my second visit to the restaurant. Being the new year's eve, the place was a bit crowded and the service standard was not as good, which is understandable but there must be no compromises on food quality. I ordered a Tortilla Espanola which was so salty and totally inedible.What a meal to end the year 
4
It's my second time at this restaurant for their weekend lunch buffet. Very reasonable and wide variety of Tapas. Highly recommended if you have guest visiting SG and don't fancy asian food.
4
Cosy ambience with friendly staff. Nice place for gatherings. Food was yummy - a wide selection of tapas and mains to choose from.
5
Celebrated daddy's birthday here, armed with 4 children. Table was set up with highchairs and children cutlery as agreed. Service staff were knowledgeable, patient and friendly. Food arrived quickly and was yummy. Good value for money. This is a return visit and would come again!
4
Service is good. Food is served within minutes. Food is nice but could be better. Only one draught beer selection (Estrella).
Good ambience.
5
The brunch deal is amazing, the food selection was great and had some vegetarian options for my friend so that was much appreciated. The sangria was well made and quickly topped up. Service was quick and with a smile :) Definitely will go again!

We met with my two friends for brunch at Don Quijote today. The entire experience was very poor there. The ambiance and deco were sordid, the food was defrost and tasted the same as the food in some bad quality bars. Everything there was far from being acceptable and definitively cannot be called Spanish food, it is an insult to the Spanish cuisine
1
Our whole experience dining at Don Quijote was a disappointment. We dined here on a Monday night so we were not expecting too much with regards to the atmosphere in the restaurant. The service was mediocre and the lady who served us was very unenthusiastic and clearly did not want to be there on a Monday night. However the biggest let-down of the night was the food.Every dish that we ordered was disappointing. The produce used were clearly frozen - frozen prawns, frozen squid and what was to be Paella tasted like tasteless squid ink fried rice. For the quality of food served, the bill of $180 for 3 adults was quite ridiculous (considering we only had one drink each).I don't normally believe in writing bad reviews for a restaurant, I would normally just move on and never go back, but Don Quijote is far from below average and a huge disappointment. Go elsewhere, so many other amazing Spanish restaurants around
4
It’s not the best Spanish restaurant but the service and ambience certainly makes up for it. Great variety of tapas. Expected better chorizo have to say. The mushrooms and the shrimps are recommended. The wine list is great but the servers didn’t know enough about them. We tried the lava cake and found it just about ok and overpriced.
3
A good concept, good location and ok ambiance. The staff were friendly and attentive. The let down was the food. Being a Spanish restaurant I would expect the Chorizo and anchovies to be of good quality and reminiscent of what you would find in Spain. It was however not the case.
4
Restaurant serves up delicious food. I would recommend the potato dishes. However, the steak and Spanish eggs were under seasoned.Decor and atmosphere is comfortable. High quality food ingredients, things here taste fresh.One big grip I have is the saltiest of the PaellaWould recommend this place for a gathering and causal lunch but food wise..not the best Spanish restaurant in singapore in my opinion
4
Visited several times....
love the beef cubes with blue cheese sauce & garlic prawns.
ambience was great, good place to catch up with friends for chat as it is not noisy like many other places.
5
My second time there, food is still as good as always. One of the best Spanish restaurants in Singapore I've tried. Service crew is always readily available and friendly throughout the whole meal. Will definitely go back there for another meal soon.
5
Recently had a large group brunch on a Saturday - quality of the tapas was very good and excellent service. All-in-all a very good quality and value brunch and nice to have the Saturday option.
3
It was a pretty long wait for our food especially the pan cooked pastas. Some of us felt the pastas came out too dry but some felt their paella/ pasta was just nice!
4
Service was good. Staffs were attentive and knows their menu well. Place needs renovation, change of curtains. Food, Chicken stew was so so. Croquettas - they can make it smaller and more portion rather than 1 big ball. Garlic shrimp taste good, but the shrimp used seems to be frozen. Asparagus wrapped in bacon - quite salty. Maybe they can use a low sodium bacon?
5
Very affordable and excellent Spanish food. Their black ink paella is yummy and authentic. Must order! The staff are attentive and helpful. As I celebrated my husbandâ€™s bday, they helped me to give him a surprise dessert! Suitable for family and friends gathering. Will visit the restaurant again!
4
Always enjoyed the selection of tapas and paella here. Went there recently with my husband and little baby. A must order is the vegetable stew. We didn't expect much from this dish but was pleasantly surprised. So tasty. Squid Int k Paella and Steak Cubes with Blue Cheese Tapas dish is really good too. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. One downer - no changing table in the bathroom. So not so convenient for families with babies
5
We arrived early and there was no one in the restaurant. Hence the staff were really attentive to us. Food was great too. I ordered steak with blue cheese and it was yummy! However I thought it was a little over-cooked for medium but nevertheless it was still a good meal.
4
We went there as recommended by my friend n the reviews in TripAdvisor seems amazing.. and it was indeed amazing! Located in 7 Dempsey road, we had a reservation before hand cause it was Friday night. actually not really need to reserve unless you come in big group. The staffs were polite and patiently explained on my questions on Paella! They have 4 types of Paella. we had the one with chorizo n meats, medium size was indeed not enough for two of us (not sure why the staff said the medium size is for 3-4 people... not! :))We had the 2nd Paella, this time was the ONE with the black ink squid. yum yum but we preferred the beef one! sooo yummy!!!it took about half an hour for each of the paella so ensure to get tapas or don't go there when you are hungry! LolThe sangria was ok but not too special. In the end we spent for about Sgd 150 for 2 Paella, 1 sausage platter and 2 booze. will defo come back there again
5
Such a wonderful experience here, meeting up with friends that dropped in at different. Each dish of tapas we order we're good, from the simple grilled vegetable, to 3 way of cooking squid, 2 ways of cooking eggs, some tenderloin cubes, and a cheese platter. Staff were friendly, accommodative and always gave good recommendation, not just the most expensive
5
Dinner was awesome. Waitors and waitresses are fast, efficient and polite. My friend had a pleasant surprise when the cake was presented to her. Will recommend don quijote to my friends.
4
Food good but abit pricey. Portion very small.
Must try the Beef Cube with Bluecheese sauce.
House pour red wine is value for money though.
4
The location is abit inconvenient for us but the food is well served. Beef is very tendered , fresh and well cook. All the tapa is well cooked but portion abit small. Overall is still good
3
Visiting this restaurant back in the days when they were still located near beauty world. Food was great but that evening's dishes were all very disappointing.
4
The meatballs in apple sauce was great. I also the beef tenderloin. The croquettes are as usualy just perfect. Only the sangria missed the mark. Lacked kick.
2
Except for the Sangria which is decent, none of the spanish food really stand out. Some dishes came out lukewarm (notwithstanding there is no crowd) and more importantly, service is lacking overall.
4
The restaurant is nicely setup with attentive and great service staff. The food was tasty and the wine was goo.
4
Has dinner on a weeknight with a friend. The atmosphere was nice and service was good. It was a relaxed restaurant and not too noisy and crowded
The food was good. Special mention to the baby shrimp in olive and garlic dish and the sangria.
4
I took my team out to dinner and there was a consensus to go Spanish. A fairly large bunch of us, noisy, and switching seats every short moment to speak to others. The staff was attentive, efficient and quick to serve. We ordered a share of tapas. The food was nicely done. Tasty and good sized portions to feed everyone. The paella was excellent. They outdid themselves with the vegetarian paella. The challenge with paella is the cooking of rice which sometimes can become soggy mess to undercooked. The kitchen obviously know their stuff and the paella was just the right texture and consistency. Kudos to them! They had a good wine and beers on the tap. A very lively and large ceilinged restaurant with a friendly staff. Definitely will go again
1
We went on a Friday night, with a craving for paella. We didn't make a reservation, but we managed to get some seats outside anyway.Upon hearing that we were ordering the Paella Valenciana, the waiter kindly informed us that it would take 40 minutes for it to be served, so we ordered the tortilla espanola and a jug of their sangria while we waited. We took a sip of the sangria when it arrived, and found it to be terribly flat, so we asked our waiter if it was supposed to to taste flat. We asked him to take the jug back to check, and he came back to tell us that it was indeed flat. The tortilla espanola would've tasted better if it had a better seasoning, but as it is, it definitely wasn't the best.The paella was served rather quickly, al dente, and with fresh clams. It was probably the only item on the table that night that wasn't terrible.. I wished that I had had a better experience, but for lack of delicious food and drinks, and no recovery from the staff, I doubt that I would be coming back here
5
I've been coming to this restaurant for years and the standard of their tapas has always been high. They don't skimp on their sangrias either which makes for a wonderful, lazy Sunday!
4
Had bread, garlic fried prawns, baby squid in its own ink, spinach and squid ink paella. Food was great.
4
We almost order the whole menu. The food basically is quite small in portion except the fish which extremely oversize.
5
Great value for brunch buffet on weekends. Food was nice too! Convivial and service was attentive without being pushy
4
Was pleasantly surprised by the good food. Reserved a table for family birthday of 10 people. Pre-ordered the chicken and it tasted delicious. The other food ordered in the paella and pike knuckles and beef stew etc etc were very well done.
5
Food was great and service excellent. Went there for a birthday dinner with the family. Plan to go again for the great food and ambience!!!
5
Great tapas! Loved the potato croquette, the tenderloin beef, meatballs in apple sauce...will certainly come back again.
5
Patronised Don Quijote since it opened at Bukit Timah and followed it to Dempsey. The usual tapa dishes and Paella never fail to please. When we have bigger party, the suckling pig and grilled barramundi are a must order!
1
We ordered Tapas and it tasted good.Chorizo with Spanish peppers in red wine sauce -> very good Beef Cheek in a red wine reduction -> very goodFried Battered Squid served with House Sauce -> A little too chewieAsparagus rolled in Bacon -> okaySweet Potato Fries -> goodSadly we had to wait over an hour till the food was served. It seems there was a mixup, nobody bothered to tell us.The staff tried to make up for it, but we were not hungry anymore, just wanted to leave and not spend another half hour waiting for for something okay.Will not go there again
3
Five of us when for the weekend brunch buffet at Don Quijote. The price was very reasonable, especially the option with free flow beer, wine and sangria. The food, however, was not very memorable. We tried all the tapas and the only really good dish was the shrimp roll with avocado and eggplant. The rest were just ok. The service was ok. We had to wait for quite a while for the food, because of the high number of orders.It was a nice restaurant to try but I don't think I will visit again
4
Good old tapas with good Sangria. The paella Valencia is fresh and cook to order. Really good just order it as soon as you get there because it takes 45 min.
4
I was quite disappointed with the food portion sizes where we paid quite alot for each item. Their paella's standard has also dropped a little. Can be alot better! However, the restaurant's service was really good.
4
The upside is the good selection of Tapas for brunch. The downside is the tendency to miss orders, and not doing much about it other than telling customers to be patient ...
4
Went last Saturday to celebrate Mother's Day with my family to this restaurant for dinner. Had a great experience as got to have authentic Spanish food in a restaurant. Had setas al ajilo in hot tapas y'day which we really enjoyed. Also had the Spanish Brandy. It is for those who like brandy and hard liquor which I liked as well. They also have the usual drinks inlcuding beer,whisky wine,etc. Also enjoyed the Tortilla Espanola and the Paella Vegetariana. Their dessert is also good which is la bomba also the most popular which we liked as well There's something for everyone in this restaurant even those who are pure vegetarians. Overall had a gr8 tim
3
Service here was excellent, maybe because we were the first guests that were here after they just opened. Good selection of tapas on the menu, both hot and cold. We ordered: fried veggies, meatballs, sweet potatoes, chorizo, Serrano ham and one cider. Food was ok but a bit tasteless to what we consider Spanish cuisine. Not worth 100$. Serrano ham was cheap supermarket type. Portions were small. Atmosphere in the restaurant was good. Would we go there again? No, not for expensive price for average food
5
We were a group of three and sat outdoors. It was very comfortable and not too hot. The view was nice and it was very relaxing. Food was delicious and served warm. We had the grilled eggplants, scrambled eggs and of course squid ink paella. It was our first time having Spanish food and would definitely come back again! It was worth the money
4
The patio is very attractive and chill and the restaurant has a good atmosphere too.6 of us ordered a paella and half a dozen tapas. We all loved the spinach, black ham - jamon and squid in ink. The clams were just ok as was the Paella. Medium Paella fed 6. Disappointing - oxtail, eggplant in broth (all tomatoes and onions, so little eggplant which is not an expensive ingredient! This dish was basically tasteless) . Desserts- fried milk was deemed good. Bread pudding & orange cheesecake "nothing to brag about" and then chocolate puff - waste of time and money - two pieces of puff pastry, drizzled with chocolate sauce with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I give it an A for creativity, C for taste !Run by all Asian staff who try hard, some speak poor English but make up for it with smiles and enthusiasm. The chef, we are told is a young SIngaproean, so kudos to home and hope he can keep improving. Product knowledge may also be lacking so management should step up training of wait staff by allowing them to taste the food, be able to compare and recommend.Extensive wine list, mostly Spanish but many are overpriced for Singapore. This is a common problem, not unique to this place! We had a bottle of $75 red, decent drink to go with tapas.Nevertheless we had a pleasant evening together and enjoyed ourselves
2
Read a lot of good reviews so decided to give this place a try. There was a Brunch Alacarte Buffet and since we have not really tried Spanish food, this seems a good introduction. In total, there were 25 dishes offered. We made a total of 3 rounds of orders but sadly as some of the other reviewers noted, orders were missed and while we waited and reminded them quite frequently, the missed orders were really missed out. Quality of food was, at best, decent. We also ordered their live claims with white wine and Churroz which were not part of the Buffet spread. Overall, this place, with poor order tracking and non-spectacular food quality, wont be missed in food haven Singapore
4
Arrived to a quiet and cosy restaurant on the eve of Good Friday. Service was decent with ushering and taking of orders.Sangria was decent (could have packed a little more punch). Still considering if $60 per jug is reasonable. If it was prepared a day before to improve the taste, then I suppose it would be reasonable. There were hits and misses of the tapas dishes we ordered. The Patatas Bravas and Meatballs were forgettable. However, the Tortillas (portion of potatoes and egg well balanced) and Grilled Squid (fresh and well seasoned) were excellent. Lamb rack was done medium rare and was a decent course.Squid Ink Paella was very flavourful and it was a pleasant surprise for me as most restaurants I've been to fall a little short on the paella end.Churros were a little too thick and the insides were a little mushy but I would say that the crisp on the outside and the dark chocolate dip made up for it.A very pleasant dinner to the restaurant and would like to return to try out the other dishes
3
This is not the best Spanish food I've had in SG and the portions are very disappointing considering the prices. But the seafood dishes were quite good - clams in white wine sauce and fried calamari were the best dishes. The churros were disappointing. A cleaner tasting oil used to fry the churros would have been good. The sangria was v smooth though.
3
The staff and service was excellent. The food is very average and doesn't deserve the rating. I wouldn't consider is high quality Spanish. Much better places exist in Singapore.
1
Stunned. Never paid so much for such average food. 5 of us had a few tapas dishes (mostly potato), 2 small and 1 large paella, and 2 jugs of Sangria. S$390!!!!! I can't believe it. Certainly won't be going back.
3
Service was poor. It seems not enough staffs that night.
Wines was good, Tapas was good. Then the main course : PAELA Don Quijote very FLOP. No taste of saffron and reached our table already cold.
Very disappointing.
5
The brunch was very reasonably priced but this didn't lower the quality of food or free flow options. Great fun.
4
The quality of the food is superb and service staff are very attentative to the needs of customers.
It's our third time to this restaurant and we will surely come back.
4
Good tapas in a very nice ambience at dempsey.Squid, meatballs and bravas are really like being back home :) Croquetas a bit different but still good.The price of the weekend brunch is also good including free flow of wine, beer or sangria. The warm bread is also delightful.Should include churros in the menu
4
Good choice when looking for a weekend brunch in Singapore. The food was quite tasty and high quality, free flow drinks (sangria and/or house wine) are included in the brunch price. The staff was very friendly and the general atmosphere was very pleasant. It was our second time there and we will come back for sure.
4
We chanced upon this restaurant on the net. As both my husband and I enjoyed Spanish food, we decided to give it a try. We have ordered 1 glass of sangria and 1 beer, 4 tapas and a small paella. And it costs SGD143. The squid cooked in squid ink and beef tripe were the 2 dishes that we loved most. The paella was very flavourful too and they gave an option for the rice to be al dente or soft. While the tapas portion did not seem to be a lot, we were full after having the paella. The service staff was very helpful as she has suggested for us to order 4 tapas instead of 6 which was our original plan. No food wastage. While settling the bill, we were asked if we like to become a member to receive some discount in future. I liked the idea that there is no membership card as you only need to provide your mobile number to receive the discount. It removes the hassle of keeping another card in your wallet and environmentally friendly too. We will definitely visit the restaurant again
4
My friend and I went for the Weekend Brunch Buffet and it was worth a try. We got a bit lost though so for those of you looking for the place, it's behind Muthu's Curry on Block 7.The buffet allows you to order from a good number of tapas, soups, pastas and desserts. The biggest section would be the tapas having over 15 choices. We tried almost everything, but our favorites from the menu would be cream of pumpkin and leek (we ordered a 2nd serving each), calamares, croquetas and gambas. You can also order freshly baked bread and they serve it with butter on the side - it was sooo good! For dessert, we tried the cheesecake and the bread pudding, and both were satisfactory endings to a pleasant brunch. Overall, the food was ok, not fantastic. But we find it value for money considering the price, number of choices, ambience and service. Given the ok food, I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 3 because my friend and I did have some favorites from the menu. And also because the service was super! The food arrived fast, the staff were very attentive, and they'd cater the serving size of the tapas depending on how many you are at the table. Will I come back? Yup, definitely! It's a nice relaxed environment and this kind of buffet is much better than standing up all the time to get food from a buffet spread.
4
Had the weekend brunch buffet ($39++) which came with a list of tapas to choose from and free flow of juices and soft drinks. The tapas were flavourful and enjoyable – in particular the aguacate con cangrejo (a refreshing dip made from crab, scallop and avocado), calamares fritos (fried battered squid), gambas al ajillo (garlic fried shrimp), rollitos de repollo con arroz (rice, bacon and nuts rolled in cabbage, which looked and tasted more like something one would find in a dim sum restaurant). The service was also prompt. The only downside was that I was thirsty for the rest of the afternoon – perhaps it was the garlic
5
Food is awesome..ambience is great..service could have been a little better, but staff were friendly..overall had a great dinner.
4
The food is fantastic. the atmosphere is so romontic and quite. The price is still acceptable for us. suit for family or friend gathering
5
We passed this place a couple of times but never really made it inside. Very nice Spanish tapas such a the famous meatballs, spicy potatoes and even paella. Very good alternative in Singapore
4
The place was quite empty for a Tuesday but food was good. Will go back again to try out their other items. I enjoyed the black squid ink pasta and pork collar dishes
5
Went with family for sunday brunch... had a great time! The food was delicious and the quantity & quality was super.staff friendly..beautiful Ambience and great value for money. Must visit.Love the place.
4
Was surprised by the good spread of food during the weekend lunch buffet. The service was generally responsive and do not have to wait too long for the food to be served.
4
Nice place to have weekend brunch. Quiet, kind of hidden. Enjoyed the food and there were quite a variety of food on the brunch buffet menu. Would visit again.
4
Must trys: Squid ink paella, Garlic butter prawn, Baby squid cooked in its own ink, Tenderloin beef cubes with cheese.
5
The staff were very friendly and extremely accommodating to all the questions my family had for them and the food was really exceptional too. Highly recommend the beef cubes with blue cheese sauce!!
5
This place look very authentic. Service was very good and we love all the food that we ordered! Love this restaurant!
5
Very satisfied with the food, services and ambience. Visited on the Christmas Eve 2016 with friends. Staff recommended the menus to us and the food was awesome!
4
We ordered a selection of tapas and had a squid ink paella. The meatballs in tomato sauce were great!
4
Had great food. Even though service could have been slightly improved with more attentive staff, everything else was awesome
4
Great food and value for money
Helpful staff
Wish they had more seating
do add some new dishes to the menu
4
we went there for our anniversary celebration. The ambience was not great. The food is great and the service attentive and accommodating. Great times
5
We are looking for something different in the area and my app suggested this restaurant. It turns out really well. We have four adults and two young kids. The restaurant was very nice and attentive to our table. We mainly ordered tapas to share. We ordered around 10 or more tapas and everything is so yummy! My kids love the kids menu options! Great place for family and friends
4
Visited Don Quijote with friends for dinner and the food was great. We had a fairly wide range of plates to share. Everything was at least good but the jamon iberico and beefcheeks were fantastic. Good friendly service in a nice room. Will definitely be back
3
Decided to try the Spanish brunch buffet at Don Quijote. For $38 you get free flow of juices/soft drinks with brunch. The salad is just one type-Russian Salad. However, there were 3 types of soup-mushroom, pumpkin and cold vegetable soup. The mains were in tapas portion. The better ones - garlic shrimp & scrambled eggs w shrimp and asparagus saw repeated orders from our table. The fried calamari was a bit overcooked. If you are craving for paella, you'll be disappointed as it is not in the buffet menu. For the price paid, the buffet was just average.
3
For a meal of 6 tapas dishes and a bottle of wine, I was hoping for more impactful flavor. The only dishes that got me were the tenderloin beef and garlic sauteed prawns, but the rest were pretty bleh. I guess one has to do their homework on what to get here to have an enjoyable meal, but I was a bit disappointed at the end of the day
4
Last night was the second time we had dined in this place.Somehow this time everything was good. Delicious food & good service. Maybe the last time we were there it was more crowded hence the attention to guest and crew ratio is spreadMore thinly.
5
Tiffany is the best waitress! Excellent food and service! Tomahawk is good but most order in advance. The paella with squid ink is really very good.
4
Recommended items: gambas, gambas w eggplant, chicken wings, croquettes, mushrooms w garlic, pigs feet
4
A very homely feel to it. The food are great and the tenderloin with blue cheese is a must try! Requested a birthday dessert in advance and they used Nutella sauce for the wording. Great lava cake to end the meal. Will visit again!
4
We ordered all our usual favorites - squid ink pasta, paella carne, Gambas, mushrooms and vegetable stew.
3
I like Don Quixote...or at least, I did. But this evening out recently, was a big disappointment for the following reasons:1) the dinner prices for tapas have increased to a point where it's no longer interesting. Way too expensive now2) the service was terrible and even when I tried to complain, they did nothing to change it. In typical Singaporean style, dinner is not to be enjoyed, but to be wolfed down so they can turn the table over. Our tapas for 4, came out of the kitchen so fast that we had eaten half of it before they even brought our bottle of wine. We asked them to bring each dish out alone, let us enjoy and talk and then bring the next one, as is customary in a tapas restaurant. They just ignored the request so our table was over-crowded with food and we ate too fast.3) the paella, which takes about 30 mins, was terrible...dry and uninspired.I know this is a chain restaurant, but it used to be a pleasant place to spend Sunday brunch or a relaxed evening with friends. Not sure we'lol go again
5
Our new fave place for great eats! The tapas are scrumptious; must haves are the beef cheek, gambas with garlic and olive oil, baby squid garlic and olive oil, chicken wings. The squid ink paella is to die for! All this downed with a jug of red wine sangria! Yummy!Save some room for dessert: fried milk with cinnamon syrup!One more thing: if you like some fire with your meal, ask for their house chilli which packs a mean punch!
5
There are very few Spanish restaurants in Singapore that serves delicious food at reasonable prices and with amazing service. Don Quijote absolutely nails these three points. I would say that Don Quijote is one of the very few "average-priced" restaurants that completely knock my socks off. The price-portion ratio is generally reasonable. Most of the items in their menu are good for sharing. Their Paellas, Pastas and Tapas are really delectable. Not mentioned their awesome concoction of Sangria. Some of the dishes we ordered which I would recommend are their Paella Especial Don Quijote, Squid Ink Pasta (best if pasta is cooked al dente) and Tenderloin Steak Cubes with Blue Cheese tapas (super awesome).Excellent service! The waitstaff assigned to us (Jonas) was very attentive and friendly. I don't think our Sangria glasses got below the halfway mark before they were refilled. He even took care of booking a cab for us. A customer experience like this one plus the awesome foods we had made that night really enjoyable especially to my friend who was there to celebrate her birthday.All in all, this restaurant is amazing and I am looking forward to returning! Will definitely recommend Don Quijote!!
4
The food is pretty good and the staff friendly and welcoming. We tried the new FideuÃ¡ Especial Don Quijote which is noodle equivalent of paella. It was flavorful and close to what I had in Spain. My local Singaporean friend described it as "Spanish Bee Hoon"
4
Very good Spanish dishes.The Suckling pig is exceptionally seasoned, especially with the chili that was prepared.The seafood paella is wonderfully fragrant, filled with fresh seafood.The beef cheek with red wine reduction is another superb dish.Gambas in garlic oil makes you want to order seconds
4
Liked the casual ambience set in the old army barracks of Dempsey hill. Restaurant was comfortably decorated and comfortable. Service was attentive although inexperienced with helping us with our choice of wine. Food got off to a good start with the grilled squid, followed by several more including the beef cubes, paella, fish pasta and several more. We enjoyed all of them. Dessert was tasty although nothing special. Would come again.
5
very good service (waitress was great, she was really friendly) and the food is good and reasonably priced. would go back again
4
There's a good variety of food & drinks. Service was impeccable! But I hope there are more dessert varieties and not just limited to 2-3.
5
The food was great - so many yummy tapas dishes. Yummy free-flow sangria. Overall awesome value for a boozy brunch!
4
While you can get better Spanish food somewhere else, this is definitely one of the best in term of service. Since we're waiting for a flight, we wanted the main course to be served at a certain time while we enjoy our tapas, for such they obliged. A waitress made good recommendation from the menu and the rest were very attentive to our needs. All in all, a very pleasant evening with good discussion
3
We were excited to find a tapas type restaurant as we like to explore foods. Unfortunately we only tried 3 items because we seemed to get forgotten when a large group of men arrived and all attention focused on serving them. We finally asked for check and left. The servings we did get to try were okay, nothing I could've do myself. Love the Dempsey area

When we went there, other than their platter with their cured meats and cheese which was really nice, we we quite disappointed. They have a dish of stir fried mushrooms and that was not of a restaurant standard. Their calamari was fresh but otherwise nothing to shout about. We had another dish in the pan with some angel hair pasta and meats which definitely wasn't what we expected.Overall it was a disappointing experience to us.

I have always wanted to try Spanish Cuisine here in Singapore but I don't know which place to go that offers authentic Spanish cooking. I guess stars aligned and I met the right people, then off we go to try Don Quijote.The place is situated in Dempsey Hill, which makes it not too accessible to public transport unless you take cab or drive there yourself. The restaurant itself is very nice and looks regally authentic. Various framed photos of modern and heritage architectures and sceneries all across Spain adorn the walls. The place is welcoming and got a homey feel to it. Soft lighting and spanish songs playing in the background. We got a privelege of dining in a private room for ourselves.We ordered some hot buns, garlic butter, and olive oil as starters. Buns are nice, soft and warm. garlic butter is just nice, while I'd say the olive oil did not make it to my expectation. I have tasted better tasting olive oil than what they offer.We ordered various selections of tapas from the usual calamari and bacon rolled asparagus, but I would have to especially mention their Garlic Fried Shrimp and Tenderloin Steak Cubes with Blue Cheese. First, the serving of these two are plenty. and just enough for sharing for 2-3 persons. The Garlic Fried Shrimps are averagely sized, and well flavored with garlic, and cooked very well. The Tenderloin Steak Cubes are very well cooked. Soft and flavorful. Dipping it in blue cheese further enhances the flavor. They got a very wide selection of dishes, but these are the stand-outs on what we have tried among the tapas.The Ox Tail Stew is just as nice. A comfort food I'd say. The meat is soft and easily breaks apart. Flavors are not too intense which makes it very pleasing to the palate. It got potatoes, carrots, and chickpeas too. You would want to order some more hot buns to wipe off all the juices from the clay pot where it is served.My Spanish friend who went with our group says that all that was served are authentic to the taste. Including the Fideua and Paella. The Fideua Negra (Squid Ink Pasta) tastes well of squid and the sea. Others might find it a bit salty, but for me it is just how it is supposed to be. The Paella Especial Don Quijote got large prawns, chicken, mussels, and I am not sure what seafood is there, but it surely tastes very good. Both Fideua and Paella are slightly burnt and crisp at the bottom of the pan which added an interesting texture and flavors. Mixing it thouroughly is the key to distributing all the flavor and the texture. Must scrape until the botom of the pan and mix well.After the mains that we've had, we still ordered some dessert for sharing. We had Leche Frita (Fried Milk) and Bomba de Chocolate (Chocolate Lava Cake). The Lava cake is the usual lava cake that you would get, but I'd say this is nicely done because the chocolate is really flowy. A good surprise to us is the Fried Milk. It is like a flan probably crusted with something (I assume bread crumbs?) then deep fried until crispy. It is not oily, nor overly sweet.And what else is best to drink while downing all these Spanish food but a Red Sangria which is very refreshing. We drank sangria from the time we started eating the buns, till the last scoop of the dessert. Such a nice way to finish a very hearty and authentic Spanish dinner.The service is excellent. The staff are very polite and attentive of your needs. They would even make sure to replace your dirty plates whenever they serve a new dish.If I would just consider the authenticity of the dishes and the taste, I'd say it is value for money. But for some reason, I find that most dishes are very highly priced (++GST and Service Fee). Just be ready to shed out hundreds of $$$ especially if you wanna try most of their dishes. Maybe I just didn't expect to be paying that much, but hell, we had a great time anyway!I won't mind going again. But probably would be a bit more mindful of how I order to at least manage the cost.But this one is highly recommendable. Thumbs-Up

I was not suppose to write a review but the excellent service of the steward Mr.Jonas prompted me do this. Food is just good but service... What to say .. It was truly Royal!!!  You have to improve the food a little more to catch more and more. The hospitality is superior and everyone is truly professional. It was worthy visit

Celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary at Don Quijote and we totally enjoyed our dinner there. We had Gamabs Al Ajillo (prawn), Fideau Negra (pasta),Tacos de Lomo al Queso Azul (beef) and Churros (dessert)... and red sangria. The meal was great with amazing services from all the staffs that served us... especially Jonas who was very friendly (great chat) and helpful (coming by to check on us at appropriate time). Thank you for making our anniversary dinner so special.... especially the greetings on our dessert :

A group of us dined at Don Quijote for birthday celebrations, and the food was fantastic. If you're looking to split the bill, or have a more affordable dining experience, opt to share the paella (4-5 pax per large pan) rather than tapas dishes. With kids in tow, we did opt to give them plates from the tapas menu (meatballs and patata bravas, followed by churros for dessert). As to be expected when busy, it can take longer for additional orders to be processed, so bring your patience with you, or you will end up frustrated as more diners fill the restaurant. In light of all of that, we will return - the food is too good to ignore!
4
Very good experience. Tasty meal and wonderful service. The floor staffs had good food knowledge and recommendations. Would definitely visit this place again.
5
Place not easy to find.
Waiters n waitresses were attentive n helpful.
Sangria is very nice. Ask for smaller portions of you going available as big group.
Food is yummy especially the croquet!

My family enjoyed the food served in this restaurant. Our favourites are fried potatoes in spicy tomatoes/chilli sauce - very tasty, tenderloin steak cubes - meat is tender and melts in the mouth and the garlic fried prawns - not in the menu but you may order prawns instead of shrimp. The desert 'Bomba de Chocolate' (lava chocolate cake) is rather disappointing.
2
It was my third time at the restaurant only to decide to not return. The food is mediocre to say the least. The SGD32 cheese board consisted of 8 or 10 very thin slices of cheese, a few thin slices of dried plum and a few pieces of walnut thrown in. No bread, no crackers, no nothing. We only sat down at 9:40pm, ordered a few tapas and some wine. At 10:10pm a waiter came over and said it was last orders. I said but that is at 10:30pm no? As advertised... He said, no last order is at 10:10pm and at 10:30pm you have to leave. I was perplexed, repeated his words and he said yes that is correct. I do beg your pardon. Lastly, I actually feel sorry for the service team. No evidence of any training; no routine in serving customers, no etiquette, and worst of all, no food or beverage knowledge. Everything you ask them about the menu, they have to go and ask someone else. Very sad
4
Haven't had Spanish food in almost 2 years.. A day before my birthday, I decided to choose this place as my go to dinner venue with my wife. Amazing food. Had 4 Tapas, a soup and a Paella. All dishes were full of flavor, and intensity. Well seasoned, cooked with perfection. Go for the fried garlic prawns. It's amazing. The garlic was fried and slightly charred and on its own, it was a delight. Nori, one of the senior member of staff was an attentive individual and was extremely polite and managed her operations very well. Kudos to the team there and I will be back
4
By coincidence we found this Spanish restaurant and it was a pleasant surprise!The waiters were very friendly and the food is excellent. We had the gazpacho and could have order much more of this delicious cold soup. The ox tail, beed skewers and chicken skewers were great too
4
Place was very quite as we arrived early for dinner (6.45pm) But it picked up soon after 7 as people came in and by the time we left (9.30pm) it was very busy and had a great atmosphere for a Thursday night. Service was friendly and efficient and most of the food was very good, the baked eggplant being out favourite.
5
Hands down one of the best Sangrias in town. The red wine sangria was divine and at $60 a pitcher, it was well worth it.The tapas and soups were good too and the ambiance was perfect for a date night- Cosy and not too noisy.This has been my go to tapas place for a while now and will still remain on that list
5
Went for weekend brunch and was honestly not expecting much like most other buffets. This exceeded my expectations!All the ala-carte buffet items were really good and served warm. Loved the shrimps and the pigs trotter!More importantly, service was friendly and gave the right recommendations in terms of portions to order for our group of 10. I will definitely be back soon
5
Wonderful food at reasonable price and impressive services from all the staff, our family have been very regular at Don. We were there this evening, right beside an extremely rude table of 10 with an incredible noisy child who has been screaming irritatingly, the entire family had no manners to consider other customers who were also present at the restaurant, hard to believe we were in Singapore. Saving grace is the usual pleasant service from all the staff, which has made our dinner still great experience. We shall be back soon again, hopefully with no ill-mannered customers
4
Good value Spanish free flow brunch in Dempsey area. Food is tasty if not spectacular but atmosphere is friendly and casual. $58++ for free flow sangria/wine/beer and all you can eat tapas.
5
All food that we ordered were super tasty! The staff recommendation was good too, not in the menu. Just excellent.
5
relaxed place, good food and service, nice owner. will come back with next trip to Sgp! just perfect to take a break and leave the city behind you :)
4
My husband and I went for their weekend brunch buffet - ala carte style with a menu that was quite limited in selections but sufficient for us to try almost everything because the portioning of each dish was spot on. Except for 1 or 2 misses, the rest of the dishes were good. Service was prompt. Glasses were regularly refilled. We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant to our family and friends
5
Everything about it was simply amazing! Paella valenciana and arroz negro are both highly recommended. Very tasty and palatable. The tapas are must tries also..except maybe for the potatoes. That one was a bit too much carbs already I guess. A bit hefty but worth the money. Will definitely go back !'
4
Been there a couple of time for the tapas buffet. Good value if you don't drink alcohol :$38 ++ . Kids over 5 pay 19++.The food is good, not 100% Spanish but close enough. Good atmosphere. I suggest to book in advance as it could get busy.
1
Based on the reviews of Tripadvisor we went to Don Quijote at Dempsey, but it was extremely disappointed! Except the pastas bravas (what can go wrong with fried potatoes), the sauces, eggplant baked in a casserole and the chicken skewers were bland and the fried mushroom were rubbery. The Japanese green tea that I orderded turned out to be Twinging tea with a fruit flavour. Further, the bill stated complementary bread which we didn't received.

There are already a few Spanish Restaurants in Singapore. Thanks God after unfortunately Santi Santamaria passed away precisely here, many have taken the role to maintain him alive in Singapore in many different ways. Some a bit more modern fine dining style like Binomio, and some others like real typical tapas place like Don QUIJOTE in Dempsey. Their different paellas are tasteful and authentic. All the other tapas, as Patatas Bravas, which is a typical Madrid style hot spicy sauce potatoes tapa, are great, the Gambas al ajillo, done with high quality big Gambas instead of the small ones you can find in other places, are simply great. And of course don't miss his wine list as it is probably the only Spanish restaurant in Singapore that has a uniquely Spanish wines wine list. On top of the food itself, the venue, Dempsey, is simply relaxing and great!! Absolutely recommendable
1
We went to don Quijote with friends and every single dish we tried was not Spanish. The prawns were cooked like they would be cooked in any Asian restaurant in singapore. They were nice but not Spanish, in fact this was the only decent fish we had. The patatas bravas were inedible and so were all the other dishes. I am sorry to write this review as I never give bad reviews but I am Spanish and it pains me to think people would go there and think what they serve in this restaurant is Spanish food. I think this could be a cheap, fast food SpAnish restaurant. A bit like the tex mex restaurants you find sometimes in America. The quality of the produce is really low and uninteresting. Be warned, this is not Spanish food.
4
It was a very crowded evening so good thing I had made reservations the day before. But the good thing was that despite the crazy mass of diners the service staff were cool, prompt, smiling and the captain (or maitr'd or whatever you call him) even engaged in a bit of friendly banter. He also waited patiently for my family to get our orders sorted out. Food was very good, as always. This was the third visit. Possibly more to come
4
Great place for friends to get together to chill and catch up with one another. Food is yummy and not too pricey. A restaurant that one can visit over and over.
5
Food was served quickly and hot. Seafood Paella is a must order. Been here many times and the food maintained its quality
5
Food and ambience was good. Service was fast. Ordered the hot tapas - squid, prawns in olive oil and garlic, roasted veg and the cold tapas - toasties with crab dip, as well as the seafood paella. Quality was excellent
5
Go early during dinner time or else you might encounter a long waiting time. Eat the paella. It is amazingly good.
4
The food and the service is good but the phone never answer when I tried to make reservation over the phone, have to make reservation online
3
If you like Spanish tapa's then this could be one of the places you might want to check out. We also like them, actually love them, but we prefer the places in Singapore which are bit more expensive and of much higher quality. Quality has its price I guess. Still, most of the tapa's were of good quality, be it not very refined but if you like the really Spanish food, then is is not necessary so it might be good for you. I
5
It's a lovely evening! Our party of 3 totally enjoyed ourselves. The ambience is good. The high ceiling mute the other diners noise, but not too quite so we can laugh comfortably without feeling obstructive.The tapas are yummy. The soups, gazepachoes are great starters...the bacon garnish adds to the chilled savory experience. The pumpkin/leek soup is smooth n just sweet enough.b We had the grilled vegetables, yummiest oven baked eggplant (served in a pot).And for paella, we had it done al dente (was told if we didn't like the bite of it, we can request to have it cooked to well-done after served). But we loved it al-dente. The saffron is frangrant but not overpowering.The highlight is the sangria! We had the red wine version. So so so good,...we'd order the jug next time
5
The dinner we had was absolutely delicious.. We went with a typical Spanish style of dinning with lots of tapas and a very very good paella to share! Food was delicious and fresh.. But what really made the night was the service , specially from the manager ( I believe) , he made some wonderful recommendations on wine which truly complimented the meal! All in all a super night out and we will definitely be back.Wine a tad pricy, but that's usually the case in Singapore. However having said that it was still reasonable considering the venue.A Must tr

Had a business dinner at Don Quijote friday night. The restaurant was about half full and we took the smoking seats outside. Food and service wise, this place was top notched. The Paella was especially good with no complains. Service was attentive as well. We were suppose to be at the restaurant next door but they were out of smoking seats
5
You always ask yourself if you can find decent tapas in Asia, but Don Quixote has done a fantastic job. They have an extensive bar with a very competent bar staff to get you started. The selection of tapas is extensive and the wait staff is helpful with recommendations (and explanations) if you are a little shy. The wine list is a bit pricey, but the selections are excellent. I highly recommend a visit.
5
There is not much to say other than, the culinary experience was excellent.
The staff was equally good.
5
Good cheese, great tapas. Paella little weak compared to everything else. Sangria was great. Vey good for sharing. Worth regular visits.
4
A variety of food choices from the menu, the tapers & mains are all tasty and the pricing is very reasonable. Will be back.
5
Everything we ordered for dinner was excellent and it was very reasonably priced. I would definitely go there again and recommend to any of my friends.
4
The food was great as usual and we usually go for the fidua, garlic prawns, chicken wings, mushroom. If they have squid in squid ink, it is a must try!
5
Paella is good but slightly pricey. Tapas are ok, but nothing to shout about. Sangria also average. Fortunately they had beer.

The restaurant runs a loyalty program as incentive for customers to re-visit again. It gives customers credit of $7 for every $100 spent, to be used in next visits. I kept track of my credit and it should be about $100. When I dined at the restaurant last time, I requested to claim rebate using my credit and the restaurant told me that I only got $50. When I questioned, the waitress gave an usual answer "the system shows $50". I spoke to Haresh, the person in charge. He suggested I use the $50 rebate for that meal and he would check and came back to me on this issue. Days passed but there has not been any communication from the restaurant. In order to keep loyal customers, the restaurant needs to understand it takes the combination of nice food, ambience & service. Obviously, Don Quijote failed in providing a reasonable follow up service
5
A fantastic place for a weekend brunch. Love the spread of tapas,love the fact that its buffet and is served on our table and portion-size of each Tapas is just right ( so that there is no wastage of food ) . Cozy ambiance. Very friendly and helpful staff
4
Our reservations was made through chope which was seamless. The selection of tapas was excellent and each dish was well executed. We took the recommendation of the server and ordered the boneless oven baked fish which was fresh and tasty. Overall the experience was good and we will go back there again
4
Been there with my family and some friends. Not ideal if you have small children as there are no children play facilities.The menu is ok as well as the food. There is a small print on the menu that said if they will chase you if you if you waste food. As I agree with it in principle, it is not nice to hear that in a restaurant. Friendly staff... We will go again without kids
3
Had the brunch buffet. Experience was ok, though not particularly great or memorable. Have definitely had much better tapas in other establishments in Spore.
4
Lovely restaurant on Dempsey Rd to visit with friends! Their chicken/seafood paella is very nice and available in different sizes. Great if you want to try some tapas as well. Also loved the Sangria.
4
We were welcomed by cheerful Mr. Jonas. He was happy to oblige our request to change our table location and set the table again. The food was good and was served fast. The servers were attentive and polite.
4
Seen many good reviews online and we decided to give it a try. The conclusion is that - the spanish food here was good. On top of that, staff were friendly and nice. Price was rather expensive however this is definitely worth a try (:
5
Great ambience. Good lighting and good soft music. Food was excellent. Tapas items, Paella and dessert - All were excellent. The staff was quite friendly as well. Slightly on the costlier side, but overall a great experience.
5
The place was nice and the food is good and the service was nice. Definitely will go there again....
5
The place has a nice ambiance. The tapas were very good, and the Paella was even better. I was stuffed when I left here and satisfied greatly with the meal.
4
Overall was good. However not up to expectation. At first, i thought that the crowd would be more. However seems like no one was there.
5
Good Ambience and Prompt Service. Best suckling pig ever taste. strongly recommend to friends & others.
3
Can't compared to the Authentic Spanish food that I have ever had, but very well cooked and seasoned. I liked the special clam, the seasoned clam had brought different tastes. More dishes we ordered: Clam, Pincho de Pimientos del Piquillo con Anchoas, Carrillada en ReducciÃ³n de Vino Tinto, Paella Valenciana , Bomba de Chocolate etc. Sangria was good but not the best I have ever tried
4
overall great but the paella was too salty. sangria was too watery so towards the end we were like drinking ice water
5
Lovely ambience. Great service. Don't miss the freshly made Paella. Must visit when in Singapore. The outdoor seating is very nice
4
We went for a casual dinner with the family and were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance (we were outdoors), the menu range and most importantly the quality of the food. Good value for money!
4
Simple dishes such as fried potatoes n herbs, cheese sticks could be so delicious!!!
Great food and nice ambiance. Excellent service and jovial staff.
Orders take time.....but all the waiting is WORTH IT!!!
Good desserts too.

I have heard of this restaurant for some time and I finally had a chance to visit this restaurant recently for dinner gathering.The restaurant is located at Dempsey Hill. Upon entering the restaurant, you are greeted with high ceilings and a warm cosy décor that makes me feel welcome. There are many photos on the walls that are taken by the restaurant owners themselves who make yearly trips to Spain to check out the food scene and culture. That’s where new food creations are thought of and added to the menu. Although the owners are local, I think they are almost Spanish! The owner is friendly and takes the time and effort to come to our table to talk to us and explain their food and its origins. Here are the highlights of our meal:1) Gamabs Al Ajillo: $18. Fried fresh shrimp in olive oil, topped with deep fried minced garlic. Prawns were succulent and medium-sized.2) Almejas al Vino Blanco: $29. Manila clams in white wine sauce. This is like a vongole. Popular amongst my dining group and gone in no time.3) Grilled Squid: $16. I like this a lot. Simply grilled. Lovely.4) Baby Squid in Black Ink sauce: $15. This is really good. Recommended!5) Battered Baby Squid: $15. Crispy on the outside and moist squid on the inside.6) Huevos Estrellados: $15 Broken eggs with Chorizo and Potato wedges. Its looks like a plate of ‘Wak Dan Hor Fun’ – Flat white noodles with beated egg in sauce. One mouthful of this and it was ‘wow’. The chorizo added a nice flavour to the dish. Really good. 7) Asado de Cochinillo Espanol: $169. Roasted Spanish style suckling pig. The whole pig is about 4.5 – 5kg. We had half the suckling pig. The skin is crackling crispy and the meat is flavourful and just salty enough without going overboard. Nice! Pre-orders are needed, as the restaurant only prepares this to order. On weekends though, they have limited portions available for on-the-spot orders.8) Fideau Negra: $65. Thin spaghettini noodles cooked in squid ink and seafood. The serving is good to be shared amongst a group of 6. It’s tasty. I like it.9) Paella Especial Don Quijote (Large): $167. The paella had lots of seafood. We also added a whole Boston lobster into the dish, as it was available on that day. Good to share! This is thus far, one of the paella I’ve had outside of Spain, which I visited years ago.Dessert1) Pudin de pan Y Manteqilla: $8. Bread and Butter Pudding. Thick chunky piece of bread held together by batter. Not bad.2) Leche Frita: $9. Fried milk with cinnamon syrup. Its like a piece of bread coated with batter and fried. Taste-wise, it reminds me of milk pudding. A unique dessert and recommended!3) Churros: $16. Who can resist churros? This was served with a side of chocolate sauce which you can dip the churros into. Its good even when eaten on its own.What I like about this place is that their portions are huge and hearty. They are good for sharing with a group of friends of family, allowing you to try more dishes, adding variety to your meal. Food quality was good and it’s definitely in my list of go-to places to dine for Spanish food. It was a great meal and a hidden gem

Celebrated my 20th Birthday here. The food was amazing, the seafood was so fresh, and they had this daily special clam thing which was just perfect. Even my friends, who hates seafood, ate the Conchas del Peregrino (Scallop Shells lled with Scallop & Crab Meat in Bechamel Sauce) and liked it. It was perfect. My favourite dish, Fideuá Negra (Squid, shrimp and pasta, cooked in squid-ink) is good as ever. It's because of this dish, I come back every year on my birthday. It's been 4 years and it still tastes excellent. The ambiance was great. I loved the sangrias. It's the perfect place for a night out with close friends.The only thing that bothered me was this one male waiter was not so subtly taking photos of us without permission. You can see he is taking photos as he used flash. Twice. If the staff are going to do that, I would rather they do it without flash because it freaked out my friends for the rest of the night.But it's okay, the food is so good, it was worth it. Plus, it was only that one waiter, the rest of the waitresses were super nice.Overall, 10/10 would recommend to others to come down. Totally worth the money. Perhaps just mention to the waiters if you feel uncomfortable to have your photos taken
2
Quality and taste just average at best and def overpriced menu. It would have been acceptable if it was fine dining but this was more like a family restaurant and tables meant for couple were placed barely twenty cm apart, making for an uncomfortable experience if It was meant to be a romantic date.
4
After eating my dinner somewhere else in Dempsey Hill i strolled down a few blocks and came here to finish the night and glad I did. The staff was very good, the desert list had some interesting offerings and the cocktails were very good. Fun atmosphere too
3
The ambiance is decent. The food is OK, considering we consumed the paella, a veg pasta and potato wedges. It was near to closing hours on a Tuesday and when we entered , the restaurant was skeptical of allowing us to dine. Eventually they let us.
5
I wrote an email to compliment them, i shall paste it here;We've dined at your restaurant earlier tonight and I must say that we are impressed with the food and service. The food was delectable with amazing sangrias paired with your selection of tapas. Especially so for the blue cheese beef, pork and paellas. The main reason I'm writing is to commend your staff von who served us and your manager Erickson. She was extremely attentive and proactive with her suggestions. She made us feel welcome and at home, truly elements of Spanish culture. Compliments to her
5
Very nice atmosphere, great staff - friendly , always with smile, excellent service, great food - tapas and paellas really good. Sangria is outstanding. If you want to have a little bit of Spain while in Singapore Don Quijote is the place to visit.
1
we went there with my boyfriend. place was empty but waiters were acting as if very busy. food was really mediocre and did not even seem fresh. and price was too high for such poor quality. would definitely not go again
4
food is great, order as you go, pretty cheap all things considered. Service was great, positive people helping you have a good time.
5
value for money with the brunch buffet. Good place to host occasion with big group. Reasonable price and good food.
5
Had a really great meal at DQ recently, great ambience, food & service!! Kudos to the team's effort...there is a wide variety of tapas on the menu to choose from, all of which we ordered was simply yummy! The live prawns with garlic & olive oil is a must try dish. The madrid style broken eggs is a hit too! Service staff know their menu well and recommend food according to the customer's taste bud.. besides that, they're attentive to our table without being intrusive. their paella de carne(we ordered a medium one) was simply amazing!Last but not least, if there is still space for dessert, try their bread & butter pudding and/or bomba choco lava cake.. definitely worth trying! In my honest opinion, this restaurant is definitely worth a return visit and marked as one of my favourite restaurant here in SG!
1
A Spanish flag, Spanish on the menu and a Spanish name does not a Spanish restaurant make.It's difficult to decide what was worst dish, we tried many, the soggy tasteless Patatas Bravas, the 'from frozen' squid with non descript sauce, the cheap bread rolls, the bland croquettes etc..etc...The highlights were few and far between, the Serranno ham was good, the ribs were cooked well though the meat quality wasn't great. The meat paella was ok.There were no bold flavours, no care in the cooking, unconcerned service, never for one moment was I transported to Spain. Where was the fried garlic, the chilli?The beer was cold, and company was good so the evening wasn't wasted but safe to say we will never go back here
2
I had high expectations for this place. The restaurant itself is beautiful and spacious. We ordered many different Tapas, and 1 jug of Sangria, and later margaritas. The Sangria was okay. The Margarita was so sweet and thick I had to order another glass of ICE because it was not cold like a Margarita should be and it was too syrupy. We've been to the other Spanish Tapas places on the island and all were much better than this one, sorry. The paella was like fried rice with what seemed to be soy sauce in it, very sticky and did not have a good flavor. I will say the Prawns were delicious! But the rest of the dishes were just ok at best. Sorry to be a downer, but as costly as food is here, just not worth it IMHO. Dessert was Fabulous
3
This restaurant is just ok. Nothing is too impressive and nothing is really bad. We have ordered Pan Con Tomate (easiest of all, just tomato, olive oil) instead something sweet with tomato was served. The paella was ok, the few tapas we ordered were also ok. Nothing exciting to go back for.
4
The ambiance was good and I like the lighting and decoration. One of my favourite dish that we ordered is the ox-tail stew or Rabo de Toro. It was really well cooked and I strongly recommend to eat this. We also had both pasta and paellas, but I prefer to eat paellas more. If you are going to have paellas, I will suggest Paella Especial Don Quijoteâ„¢ or Paella Valenciana (cheaper). As for drinks, do ask the staff over there for recommendation rather than drinking soft drinks there
5
First time visiting this restaurnt.. tried the Ox Stew, deep fried ball, calamaris, creamy beef pasta, seafood yellow fried rice, garlic prawns and some other cold dishes (cant remember the correct spanish names for each dishes.) All of them taste really good! They are all rich in their own flavours and all the ingredients are really fresh! Worth the visit!
5
We sat outdoors and the place smelled amazing as they had scented candles. Restaurant was dog-friendly, which was perfect. We dined under the stars and had amazing food! Make sure you order the paella.
5
Excellent ambience. Great food. Don't miss the Paella. Takes long to make, but has amazing flavor. Great service. One of the better restaurants in Singapore.
4
Went for dinner with friends.
Was second time visiting the rest., previous location is small now they relocated the place is much bigger and the food remain delicious..
2
Went for the Sunday brunch alacarte buffet. Not impressed with the food. Seems everything is pre-prepared even the shrimp and mushroom in olive oil which usually comes simmering hot but theirs are just warm.
3
Food is reasonably nice. Unfortunately, for the price that one pay, the portion is consider small. Hot tapas average about $10-$14. Portion is small. A sausage tapas cost $10, if i remember correctly. For just one sausage sliced into small pieces, it is considered expensive. The rice is $33 but portion is definitely small for a anyone with a big appetite

Came for dinner on a relatively quiet Tuesday evening. We picked an outdoors table. Table was mighty dusty and gritty, and obviously not prepped for dinner service. We ordered the squid ink paella and tapas - anchovy and piquillo pepper on baguette; garlic shrimp; and green beans with serrano ham. Everything fell flat - on the appeal and the flavor. Paella lacked the umami-ness and briney-ness that you'd expect from squid ink. The squid was overcooked and hence, rubbery. Next, one little one-inch sliver of anchovy on a hunk of so-so baguette, a slice of tasteless charred pepper and some greens. So boring and frustrating! I was desperate to savor the saltiness of this little gem of a fish. Alas, there was not nearly enough.Garlic shrimp is basically soggy fried garlic in oil poured over some shrimp. Did I mention soggy garlic??Finally, green beans with ham and tomatoes. It's a tad confusing. Nothing special. Nothing to rave about.Won't return

Having tested the Sunday brunch once we decided to invite some friends over for a catch up after the Christmas hols and by the end of the meal we ll agreed it was a very pleasant lunch that was good value for money in a nice setting with good service levels - would we go again and would we recommend it, YES

Don Quijote Spanish Restaurant has been my family's favourite Spanish restaurant in Singapore because it serves up good food at reasonable prices. We have dined here several times before but it was our first Christmas dinner at Don Quijote. Since it was Christmas, we just had to have their turkey (pre-ordered). The turkey, even the breast which tend to dry out easily, was so tender and juicy. The brown sauce and cranberry sauce that accompanied the bird were served warm and done beautifully as well. We also pre-ordered the whole Spanish Roast Suckling Pig. The skin was crisp with minimal oiliness and the meat was moist and tender.The Special Paella we had is also the best paella I've had so far in Singapore. The rice was cooked to the perfect texture (slightly hard in the middle), and every grain was filled with the flavour of fresh seafood. A nice crust was formed at the bottom of the pan as well. Ingredients were fresh and generous.Some other standout dishes we ordered were the Garlic prawns in olive oil, Broken eggs, Croquettas, and Spinach with raisins, pine nuts and ham.Service was very friendly and warm, which made the entire dining experience even better

I had a surprisingly enjoyable brunch at Don Quixote. Having been there for dinner before, I thought service was a little slow (pleasant but food took really long to be served) and price was a little on the high side. However, their weekend brunch is really a steal! Free-flow sangria and tapas, from a scaled down menu. Food was decent too. I particularly liked the scrambled eggs and beef pasta in cream sauce. And the bread and butter pudding was an absolute joy too. Really good service from the wait crew - they were fast and efficient (my glass of sangria was very constantly topped up). I'm now planning my next visit.

Recently, we had a class reunion at this restaurant. Food taste great. Potion seems small but filling. Service staff also frequently pop by to check on needs of customer though missed out on some drinks order. Would love to go back again! Love the paella negro especially. Taste exactly like what I had in Barcelona

Forget all you know about meat...!!!
Order the Tomahawk....!!!
The best piece of meat in Singapore....
And the owner knows his ingredients!
He travelled the world to study food...
Back to the tomahawk: leave your review here...

Customer service was good. Food was good as well.
Just that the special request for the cake took a bit too long to serve.

Great food. As good as being in Spain.
Must try the Gambas with Chrizo.
Friendly staff & good service.
Strongly recommend. Value for money.

Went last night and it was a disappointing meal. We ordered 6 items incl the Don Quijote platter of cold cuts and cheese and all were missing the "edge" of flavour you get in Spanish food. Cold cuts were of low/supermarket quality, albondigas very dense and flavourless, patatas bravas not fully cooked with a bland sauce etc etc. Considering the great options around Singapore for authentic & modern Spanish food it's safe to say I won't be coming back here.Total bill was $118 excl alcoho

Went there with my girlfriend for dinner. When we first sat down, we were actually unsure of what to order however that changed very quickly. The person-in-charge, Jon, made us feel very comfortable. He was polite and sincere and his recommendations were gastronomically awesome! Price is fair, staff is helpful and polite, food is good. Highly recommended
5
We popped in today to try their brunch special. You simply cant beat it ... free flowing drinks and tapas. Food was terrific on the most part, we liked almost all dishes. Service was great, friendly and prompt. We'll go back for sure .... really enjoyed it

After waiting for more than 1 hour for our mains to arrive, the tagline "We make everything fresh," was beginning to look more like a cleverly conceived business plan, designed to wring a few more drinks out of diners.My wife and I visited on a Friday night, ordered 2 tapas and a small squid ink paella. Seafood tapas on a ceramic dish that should have taken no more than 10 mins under a grill, took 30 mins - mind you, that was just the garlic baby squid. The grilled prawns took another 15 mins and only miraculously appeared within 2 mins, after we enquired.Well past our 1-hour wait, we were still waiting on our squid ink paella. It was only when we decided to cancel it, did it again miraculously appear under 1 min.Manpower shortage? But the waiters were hovering around outside. "The seafood was feisty; it put up quite the fight!" would have been more apt and would certainly have gelled much better with the restaurant tagline.Tapas was fresh; that was the redeeming grace but the paella was burnt.Perhaps if I had my siesta and 2 to 3 hours to languish, fully expecting to dine past 12 midnight, I might consider coming back

This is the place both my fiancÃ© and myself have in mind whenever we crave for Spanish despite the fact that we do scout around for new dining place every time we want to have Spanish. But we always end up at the same restaurant every time! We had our anniversary, birthday and 'monthesary' there over these 4 years. Love the friendly and warm service! Food is priced friendly. Love the white and red Sangria! Haven't got the chance to try the sparking wine Sangria... Definitely will go back again anytime!!

We were here to celebrate our wedding anniversary just on Monday and were blown away by the experience at Don Quijote. We ordered the stewed eggplant, croquettes and garlic prawn tapas for starters and the squid ink paella for 2. don quijote got everything right, from the timing and pace of food served, the portions (fairly huge) and the taste... mamamia, all three dishes were as good if not better than what we ate in spain! all that paired with a jug of white wine sangria... we were in spanish heaven in singapore. the ambience was also really romantic, under the bulbs lightings on the trees. the service staff made sure our glasses were topped up, periodically checked whether everything was going well (manager james ng personally dropped by to make sure of that), and most importantly, the whole experience didnt break our banks. $165 for two for eating at what is now our favourite restaurant in Singapore - well that's certainly a steal.

I spend with my family 3 days in Singapore. We are spanish, so we wanted to try how was the spanish food in Singapore.We found Don Quijote, and we decided to try it. We order so many spanish dishes and everything make you travel back in time to Spain, because it was delicious and completely real. The chipirones were made very good, we also try garlic shrimps (gambas al ajillo), pollo asado and beef! I was impressed, we just looked like we were in ''la plaza de la moraleja'' in Madrid dining.And the best for last! We dared to ask a ''cochinillo'' (spanish pig) to see how much they knew Spanish cooking good food, because if they are able to get a good Cochinillo, everything else will be also good.FINALY THE ''COCHINILLO WAS AMAZING''!! Even better than many you can find in Segovia or Salamanca!The wine list was very big and with good spanish wines. We asked for the Montalvo and we loved it.Perfect Dinner!!

The service staff are friendly and attentive. The food are also excellent. Pricewise is not the most ex but decent for spanish food in Singapore.
4
Ate there just for tapas and paella.. Overall the tapas are quite nice, and also the paella.. Meet with the owner of this restaurant (Lucas). He is so kind and friendly person, and sharing a lot of thing about spain and its food...
5
We were a party of two at the Don Quijote last night and I must say our experience completely justified the reason I returned a second time. We ordered the cheese platter, garlic mushrooms, croquettes, tortilla espanola and paella; all of which were cooked to perfection and rather flawlessly encapsulated the essence of Spanish cuisine. Staff were very attentive, helpful, and friendly. Definitely go to Don Quijote for an authentic Spanish culinary experience
4
Most dishes at Don Quijote were good. The service, the sangria, tapas, and the main course tenderloin steak were all delicious but paella was disappointing!Not a cheap dining experience and tapas portions seem smaller than other Spanish restaurants but they were very tasty! Oxtail tapas is a must try
5
i was here last month the food was great and the service was excellent! I had the pleasure of meeting your very friendly staff Dion who was especially attentive to our needs. The whole experience was complete with a fantastic dessert ( the chocolate lava cake ) and a warm friendly chat with the manager, Jon. I will recommend this restaurant to my friends and I will be back!
5
Went at ate at their 2nd monthly BBQ Night and it was excellent!Not the cheapest meal, but certainly very high quality spread and real value for money!Not gas but charcoal BBQ pits (counted two), a wide selection of live seafood that included boston lobsters, selection of fish, squid, premium meats like bone-in Wagyu steaks, Spanish roasted suckling pigs, Spanish fresh pork, rack of lamb and paella and fideua and the list goes on and on.. Not a huge spread like in hotels, but certainly a better executed BBQ buffet with free-flow of booze that included French champagne, Spanish Cava and Sangria and there were others but didn't need to go there!Yummy

Spanish tapas is gaining popularity and tapas bars are popping up all over the place. Dempsey Hill is a restaurant hub of excellence and a perfect setting for one of Singapore's 'A' list tapas bars. It's mor than a bar, it's a restaurant serving brilliant tapas creations. The service is very welcoming, personal and attentive all the way through (not one of those 'sit and forget' places). The decor is rustic, relates to the cuisine and very very nice. The ambience and 'tempo' of the restaurant is relaxing, cool and calm, without feeling slow and sleepy. It certainly doesn't have that pushy "hurry up and get out" intensity to it.The food menu is extensive, spoiling you for choice with many traditional tapas and a whole string of house specials particular to this restaurant. The wine list - very well done too. Lots of choice and all of it well suited to the food being served.But, I must highlight my reason for going - to have a real paella and my my, do these guys serve a bloody good one. I cook a lot of paella and know how to produce a real one and so do these guys. I spotted it right away when reading the menu and it states (when ordering) "Please allow 30 to 45 minutes for your paella" - bingo! That's what you want to hear, because that means they make it from scratch, in the paellera that's brought to your table. The paella I had was nearly perfect, it had the right balances of pimenton, stock, meats (chicken with the bone!, sublime) and seafood. The chef didn't overdo the toppings, because remember, paella is a rice dish after all. I said 'nearly perfect' in that the only query I had was that the chef used a short grain Japanese rice, instead of the proper Spanish bomb or calasparra rice. It was no flaw to the dish in this case, because the chef knew what he was doing and maybe I learned something new.All in all, perfect and do yourself a favour and go

We read about this place in a magazine. I was a bit warry because restaurants on Dempsey road are always a bit of a "hit and miss". This one was definitely a hit. We ordered a selection of tapas to start and a meat paella as a main. All of it washed down with a nicely prepared jug of sangria. The chorizo, cold cuts and croquetas tapas we had were all very good and prepared as you would get them in Spain. The paella was excellent. I lived 3 years in Spain and a colleague from Valencia proudly taught me how to cook a proper paella. He would have approved of Don Quijote's paella! The rice was cooked in a proper paella pan, came as a tin layer of rice cooked al dente and the bottom layer of rice had a nice "soccarat", the toasted bit of rice which sticks to the pan. The chef certainly has been trained to make a proper paella. The atmosphere is nothing special, but the service was perfect and very attentive. I will definitely come back here on a next trip to Singapore

It's a little hard to swallow that probably the best steak we've sunk our teeth in to is in a Spanish restaurant in Singapore. Hard because there isn't a dearth of steak houses here. in fact there are more than necessary.Don Quijote serves a charcoal-grilled tomahawk that feeds a party and feeds it well. It's not easy to get a tomahawk done right given the size and 'build' of the meat but they do this better than any place boasting this cut we've tried. I recommend trying the beef with different salts they offer and pick one that suits you. That's all you really need when good quality beef is served. It's a huge serving (up to over 2kg) so bring the party or an incredible appetite! here's a video they've made:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YboMvbRDqGAenjoy

Have been attracted to this restaurant after seeing the posts in facebook. So we went there for our anniversary celebration. The ambience was not great. If compared to Sabio by the sea, which has open concept with great view and chill factor, this one has an earthy tone. We tried several tapas. Our favorite got to be the squids in its own ink and beef cubes with blue cheese. I was surprised that the squid ink baby squids turned out to be the best dish as it reminded me of nasi padang squid ink sotong dish I had when I was young. The flavours just burst into your mouth with each bite. The garlic mushroom is not as good as the one at Sabio. The special seafood paella was not so special after all and nothing to shout about. Aside from.the big juicy prawns, every other seafood (squids, clams, mussles) were overcooked and rubbery. The dish came quite late as the kitchen apparently missed the order. By then we had already 6 other tapas dishes. So we were quite full when we started eating the paella. Hence, our review of the signature paella dish may not be entirely fair. Nevertheless, Service was quite good and attentive. The manager made effort to strike conversation with the patrons.We also ordered the egg plant in casserole. It was a comfort food and a very good stew. The manager recommended the broken egg dish but we didn't finished it. The taste was overpowering and too saltish. We felt too satiated that we felt repulsive. Next time we will skip the paella and dive straight to savor the tapas dishes. I think that's good and filling enough
1
Had some hot and cold tapas, gaspacho was poor, patatas were terrible, can not finish our plates. The Ham is better out of cold storage. Not even trying to get close to tapas taste.
2
Food was not tasty, decor not good, service was good. The portions were very small, paella was very medicore, it's really not worth the time and money
4
Having dined at quite a few Spanish eateries, including Catalunya and Esquina, this year, I'd say that Don Quijote is definitely one of the few on the top of my list for Spanish food. The service is good and the atmosphere is just just nice. They've a good selection of tapas and mains, as well as a decent selection of wines to choose from. Overall a pleasant dining experience
5
Not resting on their laurels by already dishing our one of our island's best Spanish food, we were recently introduced to a relatively recent addition to their menu, ChuletÃ³n de Buey (or bone-steak?).In English, that translates to a massive piece of moo that is quite simply one of the better Tomahawk steaks we've had in Singapore!Subject to what is available (limited quantities, we were told) on the day, we had a 1.8kg 400-day-grain-fed piece of deliciousness... subject to how much of a hurry you are in, the 'quick way' would be for the cooking to be done on the griddle... But if you are willing to add another 30mins (which we did) so that they can start and stoke real charcoals, then what you will endup with is a fantastic char-grilled and slightly smoked steak that would put many so-called steak houses to shame
4
If you like homely style, authentic Spanish food, Don Quijote is the place.Not to be compared with classier or mildly gastronomical places like Catalunya, Don Quijote strives for simple recipes served in Spain. The interior is also simple and earthy to recreate the feeling of having a casual meal back in espanyol. I found that some of the Paella/pasta dishes might be a tad salty, but that was exactly how I felt when I was in Barcelona, Spain, so that just might be following a real Spanish recipe. Just beware of that. The tapas in general are quite flavourful in taste, but they have mild inconsistencies with the cooking technique

don quijote has been around for some 7 years at different locations. food has remained consistently good. they offer a spanish only wine list with over 100 labels from spain's famed wine producing regions are available and include vintages from the 'golden mile' wineries like arzuaga and vega sicilia. there are 3 menus available, a la carte, brunch and market menu. the a la carte menu is a large one with over 70 food items. the paellas are quite clearly some of the best available with a choice of either the more traditional ones made with short grain rice or fideua, a spanish pasta similar to the italian's angel hair. we had the trademarked paella especial don quijote. this one packs a variety of seafood including scallops, shrimp, mussels, large prawns and more. it's quite a sight to behold and is very good. there's also a special order lobster paella we tried made with squid ink and 'live' boston lobster. absolutely divine but available only through a 2 day advance order only. another dish i like is the oxtail stew. naturally sweet with generous chick peas and carrots and savoury oxtail with fall off the bone tenderness. get a side of bread and wipe the dish clean. if you're into pig's feet then pig out here. the pig's feet stew is decadent.other tapas we tried include the garlic fried shrimp which is another dish you'd probably wipe clean with some bread. also baby squid cooked in its own ink. the beef tripe with chorizo works for me as well and i also love the broken eggs, madrid's famed tapas. the steak and lamb rack were well-received dishes as so are the beef and chicken skewers from the basque region. there's one meat in particular i have yet to sink my teeth into, the tomahawk steak. that's going to be a separate adventure since the sizes range from 1.1kg to 2.3kg depending on what's available for the day. so that's a story for another day.the market menu is a separate menu with a small range of seafood available for the day only. chef buys live seafood from the market in limited quantities and offers them while stocks last. these include grilled whole fish, sea scallops, boston lobster, clams, mussels etc. we had the clams and fish. i like it that they're not overly prepared and are made with simple cooking methods that bring out the best of the fresh ingredients. dining at don quijote is a pleasure but it does get crowded on peak days when food service can slow down. this happens in every popular restaurant i have dined in and that's mainly due to manpower issues that are plaguing service industries in singapore. other than that it's not only a good place to get good spanish food but good food through a very good variety in general. the large spanish wine list works well for me too
5
Saturday 9th brunch great food good service excellent valueI suggest you try the free flow beer or sangria before they put the priceGreat team of six Filipinos looked after us very wellIt's not often we have cause to tip over the standard service charge Go hungry go thirsty and relax the rest of the da

Nestled towards the end of a long bungalow is this Spanish Restaurant. Great out door seating or go inside. Which has a rustic European feel. Booked a company dinner, with a pre chosen menu. A great evening and location. Considering we were a larger group, the food was fresh, different flavours and a nice treat for everyone. The tapas came out in a steady flow, which also gave us time for conversation and bonding as a team. The concept of sharing food worked well with a large group. Service was very attention, warm and professional from everyone we came into contact with, nothing seemed to be to difficult to ask for. So impressed I was that I am moving some other functions to this restaurant. Good service, good food, good location, all the perfect makings for a larger group event
5
My friends gave me a pleasant birthday treat at this restaurant. Was there to try out the highly raved weekend brunch buffet and we decided to go for the package that comes with beer and wine. Sat inside the airconditioned area as the weather was unbearable in the afternoon. Service was superb. Every food listed on the brunch menu was yummy! The fruity wine was refreshing too
5
Me and my girlfriend went down to don quijote and boy was it amazing!First off, service was amazing and warm, food was hot and send to our table with amazing food plating and food service was fast! (food came in 7 mins) We had Garlic Fried Mushroom : woody and fresh just the way we like it! Steak cubes with blue cheese : melts in your mouth and extremely tasty the blue cheese complements the beef very well Seafood and chicken paella: It was AMAZING! enough said. sangria: I had the white while she had red one, both where refreshing and delicious thankfully not to strong. We will be back for sure!

I went to this restaurant as part of a business conference night out. Food was average - tapas which was served hot but lacked taste. Waiters did their best to keep up service which was good. Only one toilet per gender which made timing important.
4
Sitting outdoors and surrounded by lush greenery, we enjoyed what-it-said-on-the-box... Over 25 items on the Weekend Buffet Brunch Menu, ordered and prepared a la carte.. Overall a very pleasant dining experience with attentive service.. Definitely worth repeat visits..
4
We had the free flow brunch Sunday. Some of the dishes were very good croquettes, chorizo, meatballs, asparagus and shrimp omelette were very good.
Service was excellent. Noisy inside, great outside.
5
I've been to Don Quijote a few times with family and friends, for celebrations as well as simple dinners and chill time. The food is great and the service attentive and accommodating. Great times. Always.The nice and hot starter bread roll and garlic butter is just pure sin. (b'cos a whole dollop of butter goes with every bite I take!)The baby squid (both the garlic with olive oil and the battered fried version... I can't decide which one I like better) is simply addictive. The shrimp rolled in eggplant tapas is yummy and yet not sinful.The tenderloin cube steak with blue cheese took me by surprise the first time I had it. Tender and tasty. (I don't usually eat tenderloin... too lean. But here, YES!) For mains... It sounds unbelievable and probably silly, but the pasta here is quite something! The mushroom and beef pasta in cream sauce. Yah, I feel silly too. This is a Spanish restaurant! Not Italian. But it's truly very good! And simply awesome with their homemade chili. Then, there's the flavourful squid ink pasta. One of my favourites.The Don Quijote special paella is a winner too. For a steak lover, get the dry-aged tomahawk. This dish, I strongly suggest sharing. It's huuuuuuge! No Michelin star chefs. No white table cloths. But who cares. I'll be back for the good food
4
I brought two separate groups of company guests to Don Quijote on different timings, one in early May 2013 and the other group on Tuesday, 30 July 2013. I received very good feedback from the first group thus I tried again this same restaurant for another group (who came to Singapore on 30th July). Our guests liked and enjoyed the food very much. Special applause to their cooks! Service is also excellent. Their staff are friendly and attentive. I didn't hear any complaint from our corporate guests..For two times now, I had not gone wrong in making the decision to use Don Quijote for corporate dinners. I am pleased

It is understandable that a restaurant sometimes is not at its best at the beginning of the week. But I cannot say the same for this place. Right from the get go, we were welcomed very warmly by our server, Jon. He introduced the menu and all their specials and popular dishes with professionalism and passion. You know how when you ask 'what is good on the menu' and the reply is everything is good or that they point first to the most expensive thing on the menu? Well Jon had the flair to not fall into that trap and embraced his "courage" to make a recommendation. (hah he even staked his little pinkie on his selections). He even gave him the initiative to plan our menu as he inspired such trust with his guests. The food was phenomenal!! We had the most tender beef tapas ever and the broken eggs tapas was also full of flavour. The garlic prawns were an instant hit and with Jon's recommendation of saving our bread to dip into the sauce, we were in culinary heaven. Finally, we had a squid ink paella which was so exquisitely done, the thought of setting in our minds that Don Quijote is THE Spanish Restaurant in Singapore. Many a time local Spanish restaurants try and charge you an arm and a leg for an over sized portion of paella, however Don Quijote offers smaller portions at an affordable price of 30 bucks (and did I mention it tastes so good??)A repeat visit is a must and it certainly has restored my faith in Singapore Spanish Food.Kudos to Jon and his team
4
Our family had the pleasure of dining at Don Quijote, Dempsey Road, in May this year. It was beyond our expectation. Jon made us felt very welcome the minute we entered the restaurant. His recommendations were superb. The Tapas selection was interesting and we enjoyed and finished every dish that was brought out. The Seafood Paella was delicious – crunchy prawns and fresh clams. The Lecha Frita, fried milk with cinnamon syrup, had a good texture and was not overly sweet.We loved the food and Jon's impeccable service so much that we brought our friends for Sunday Brunch yesterday. They enjoyed the spread and the Sangria. Even our friend’s noisy two year old son enjoyed the Tapas so much that he nodded his head and asked for more. Thumbs up for the food and service!

I had dinner with a friend at this restaurant because Margarita's was booked out.We sat outside where it's nice but a bit dark. We ordered the Fideuas Vegetariana and a few tapas and sangrias de cava.The service was slow even though the restaurant wasn't busy on a Satudary night. The wait staff repeatedly came to apologize for the long wait for the food. Drinks were also slow but compared to the food, it was relatively quick.When the fideuas arrived, the pan was pretty hot. As I always do, I take a few bites for taste for salt/pepper. Then I mixed it up. I ate maybe 5-10% of it when I put my fork in and pulled out a funny looking piece. It was dark so I put the candle to the pan and found a big piece of plastic wrap of about 15x10cm! I called the waiter immediately, who exclaimed "OMG" when he saw the plastic on the plate. My friend asked for the manager, who came in a few minutes apologizing profusely and asking if he could replace the dish. I'd lost my appetite after witnessing this sort of kitchen preparation and frankly did not trust the kitchen for anything.Fideua is pretty simple to make. It's amazing how a big sheet of plastic could fall into the pan unless they have everything precooked, reheated in a microwave or on the pan itself. Either way, it's not very clean.The manager did ask if he could buy me a drink as compensation. I just wanted the bill and get out of there. But my friend hadn't finished eating and accepted a fruit juice in my stead to get the manager away. He also said he would take the Fideua out of the bill, like it was an option for him. He did apologize a few times but overall, the way it was handled was poor.Basically, mistakes can be made and a little plastic in the food isn't too harmful to the health. However, that's not the issue. If such a big piece of plastic can get into the Fideua, what else is wrong with the kitchen?I can't recommend this restaurant at all! I do wish I wasn't so annoyed that I remembered to take a photo

We went for a easy Tapas dinner after drinks and were not disappointed. The Tapas menu was wide and varied. The service was excellent and attentive without being intrusive. small suggestions made were accepted with a positive attitude.The only comment i would make is the food was not hot. That would have helped
4
Generally a nice restaurant, cosy atmosphere inside and seating available outside. The service was fairly good, although the Tapas came out in drips and drabs, it would have been nice if it all came out of the kitchen together. The best tapas were the prawn dishes, the flavour was excellent. I went with a group of colleagues and we were able to get a table for 8 without a reservation. Prices are fairly high, but expected in Singapore, the restaurant is in an area popular with Expat's not so easy to get too, unless you have a car
4
Great tapas, though food took quite a while to come. Seafood Paella, eggplant, grilled prawns were all excellent
3
Decent service average food and for lack of any better choices OK to patronize
2
My 7th day in Singapore and went to this Spanish Restaurant nestled in the lovely Dempsey area with my Singapore colleagues. We ordered a mixture of tapas and the paella. Maybe folks in Singapore have a high salt intake because all the dishes were extremely salty, the spanish sausages were tough and rubbery, the paella was overcooked. Awful
5
Went this evening for dinner. And we both agreed, we haven't felt this way in a long time... which is in having such good food, a fulfilling meal. We had the Tortilla Espanola (Egg stuffed with Potatoes) 7/10 ($11), Live Shrimp with Garlic 9.5/10 ($16), and Tenderloin beef cubes with Blue Cheese (9.5/10) ($20). The shrimps were indeed fresh, and the tenderloin was just out of this world.Our mains was the classic dish of seafood paella 9/10 ($30), which was surprisingly good. we have been to a few Spanish diners before and none tasted as good.Overall a fantastic meal, will definitely return
4
Spend some time for light dinner and drinks at the Dempsey Hill outlet recently. First impression wasn't to greta, but the tapas we ordered where of good, solid quality and very tasty. The wine selection is impressive, although a tad expensive, apparently taking advantage of the lack of Spanish wines of higher quality being imported through the retail market. Service is OK, a little more knowledge about the product would help to make it better. Never mind, the overall impression is positive and we will be back for more tapas sampling soon
3
Spent SGD$140 for 2 for dinner.Ordered a paella, 2 tapas and a jug of sangria. Quite expensive, I would say, given that the food quality was not very amazing. Just average. Service staff were attentive and helpful in recommending food. Don't think we will go back again. Dempsey is not easily accessible by public transport except taxi. If you take a taxi here, you might as well visit other restaurants after having dinner here to make the visit more worthwhile. Nearby CMPB for beer, Wine Company for wine and Ben and Jerry's for ice cream

My family loves Spanish food and we have been trying different establishments. The one we keep coming back to is Don Quijote. Granted, the food is not the best we've had, nor is it the most cheaply priced. But what keeps us coming back is the excellent service, great ambience and just a lovely overall dining experience. And the food is generally very good, occasionally excellent.Our favourites on the menu incude the jamon, bacon-wrapped asparagus, beef tenderloin with blue cheese sauce and paella with seafood and chicken. The service staff remember us even though we have only eaten there three or four times; though I will say the visits were quite close together; we went away wanting more each time! The ambience is warm and inviting, comfortable rather than posh, with charming touches like old photographs, paintings and candles.Am going back there again tomorrow. My mouth is watering at the prospect
5
We just arrived in Singapore and opted for Don Quijote with our friends. The tapas, sangria and most especially the Paella were excellent! We will be going back definitely. The restaurant is fairly spacious with both garden and indoor setting. We started with the typical food we like - gambas, chorizo, meatballs with apple and spicy gambas. We chowed them down quickly and was ready for our main. We tried a small plate of paella negra and a large plate of the DQ Paella which was full of shrimps, mussels, scallops and clams.Service was also very good as well. Worth the visit
3
Went here on weekday dinner with partner.The staff are friendly but needed to be waved down a few times to get their attention.(It was not crowded)Food is good, yet not superb.

I recently attended a private party at Don Quijote for a marriage celebration. From the beginning I was impressed with the friendly staff and the A+ service. They were very accomidating, warm and welcoming and the evening went perfectly.The food: Are you kidding me? We were fortunate to have a very large group and were able to try several of the tapas. The food was perfectly prepared, and the seafood was top notch. I could not stop eating the food because it was so good! I would definately recommend this hidden jem if you plan to visit Singapore. This place deserves to be around for a very long time
