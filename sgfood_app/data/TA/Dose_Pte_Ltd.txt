I was staying next door, and was to leave in the morning, but got delayed, and starving!I'd been seeing this place everyday on my way to work and back. Thought I'd give it a try. Fresh eggs and croissants, with ham and bacon the side! On an empty stomach, this is absolute heaven! It's got free wifi to boot, so you're sorted in more senses than one. Breakfast was followed by a very nice cup of latte, was very nice indeed. Very small joint, but I'll definitely recommend it to anyone staying on Tyrwhitt Road or anywhere close by
