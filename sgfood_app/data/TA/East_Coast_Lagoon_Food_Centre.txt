Growing up in Singapore, east coast lagoon food centre is a hawker that I frequently visit whenever I am back in Singapore, however tonight I feel the need to acknowledge and highlight the exceptional service that I received at the DUCK RICE AN DUCK PORRIDGE STALL (yellow sign). After queuing up for 15 minutes (at 6.15pm on a Sunday night) the lady boss informed me and the 2 customers in front of me that they MIGHT not have enough duck for us because it had been really busy which I responded with disappointment as this was the second time in a week that this has happened and I am currently visiting from overseas. After queueing up for another 15 minutes I decided to give up hope and proceeded back to my table. 20 minutes later, after my family and I had just finished our meal, the lady boss from the duck rice and porridge stall comes up to my table (after looking for me around the whole hawker centre!!) with a huge box of duck rice and said that she promised she would keep some for me if there was any left and there was!! She refused to accept payment and thanked us for coming back to the stall ❤️❤️❤️ In over 20 years of being in Singapore I have never experienced such wonderful service and I am honestly so touched!! Not to mention that the duck rice is seriously the best I have tried in Singapore, absolutely delicious! What a wonderful experience!

Stopped here for a sugarcane juice and a quick rest whilst cycling through East Coast Park on the way back from Changi Village. Not very busy here during the morning and getting a sugarcane juice isn't a problem. A nice way to break up a long ride

Big food market where you can find all kinds of Asian cuisine. Walk around and choose the place you like, pick a table (they will bring your food here). Prices vary from cheap to expensive, just find the right food stand. Satay from duck, chicken en beef is made outside on the grill (we went in the evening). We just didn't like walking around and being ask to join for food and drinks every food stand we passed by. Overal good experience. Bring some napkins, seems like they don't give it with your food. It can be a bit messy while eating marinated chicken wings or peeling tiger prawns. Enjoy
5
Just a perfect place to hang around in the weekend and enjoy a relaxing afternoon! This is where I'd like to take overseas friends to introduce Singapore, have a beer, chill and let the world pass by.This area is just great, had all kind of different foods from different stalls and was not disappointed once

Located at The Eastern part of Singapore. Next to the sea with plenty of food varieties to choose from. Is all about Local. You can choose to rent a bicycle and ride around the path of the sea side before enjoying the meal. But to get there. You can choose to grab a taxi or public bus and walk over.
5
My favourite hawker centre in all Singapore. Located in east coasy park provides the most significant local delicacies u would like to have at the sea side. My fav are the chicken satay and the chicken wings along with either coconut milk or either of ice bucket local Tiger beer, enjoying it at the front seaside with the lovely smell of charcoal... Yummy
4
Great Seafood Dinner. Reasonably Priced. Beer and Satay Available. Food ordered will be served. Nice seating. Weekends avoid. Very packed. Most travel by taxi in. But getting out from there will be a very difficult. Tourists have to call taxi in. Make sure u get the address properly. East coast is a big place. Get help from a local with knowledge to book a taxi out of there.. Use Grab AppOr Comfort Taxi App.Ensure u type in the location. Do not use auto location feature. It will not be accurate. Ure taxi will not be there.

Been here quite a few times, mainly in the morning, to get a coconut or a tea when cycling in the vicinity. Most recent visit was today, but unfortunately the coconut wasn't that fresh: just the coconut juice inside and no white flesh. Previous visits have had better quality coconuts. Early in the morning there's not much of a choice of vendors as few places are actually open
5
Practically every stall has a line of people queuing up for food. There is chinese, malay and western food. You will be hard done knowing which stall to try. Just go to those with the longest queue, you will not go wrong. Please beware that it very diffcult to get a table here, so come early
5
The BBQ Seafoods at East Coast Lagoon Food Center at stall 16 was great. I know that many BBQ stall there pre-cook their sting rays because of the crowd there. But this stall 16 never do that, and they only cook the sting rays when you order. And the other seafoods at this stall was also great. "It’s A Great place to dine at with the whole family
1
Most of the drinks stall do not list the prices. A large cup of freah sugar cane water cost $3 or $3.50. Satay/BBQ chicken wings are still the best
5
Prior and now after the renovation of this food court the quality of the numerous cuisines on offer is as excellent as always!
The various satay options are plentiful and a must try!
4
We often end up at the food centre on Saturday or Sunday because of the variety of choices and its location.
4
Very authentic Singaporean food hawker style, great place and great staff very good location too o don't see many cons here
4
A lot of variety hosting every local cuisine from Chinese, Indian, Malay and Western food. Must try the satay, meats on sticks dipped in a rich peanut sauce. Nice ambience but can be crowded every evening and gets worst on weekends. Food prices are slightly higher than neighbourhood hawker centre but still relatively reasonable. Best is to rent a bicycle and ride around East Coast Park, soak in the sun and breeze, take a dip in the sea, play with sand or jog before heading to the hawker centre to chill, unwind and enjoy a meal. For those without own transportation, access is by taxi or public bus
4
You'll be hard pressed to find a food court/centre with such beautiful views, especially in the evening when the sun is setting. The food too was very good. We had satays from Haroon, cuttlefish and kangkong and rojak, all washed down with coconut juice. We could even dug out the young coconut flesh after we finished the coconut water
5
Alongside the beautiful East Coast park this Hawker centre has it all Probably best known for its BBQ satay but also the "carrot cake" (its kinda savoury) and the bbq stingray are also great (very spicy) You can also buy alcoholic drinks there at a reasonable pric
5
What an excellent hawker food centre! An outdoor centre with the charcoal fires going to cook the satay makes a great change from the usual indoor setting. Being out is the sun and fresh air also adds to the charm. The stand outs here are the satay which are delicious, Ah Hwee BBQ chicken wings, Roxy Laksa, Kampong Rojas and the Lagoon Chicken Curry Puff. Unfortunately, we could only visit once and didn't get to try the Song Kee fried oyster but would definitely do that next time
4
You have to escape the city center for a visit to the East Coast Langoon Food Center. Therefore, you will be able to enjoy the certain kind of beloved holiday feeling. The center is located at the shores of Singaporeâ€™s East Coast. At the stalls of Houses 63, you can enjoy your meal with view onto the sea, including a little resort feeling. Many of the tables are without a roof, so you can inhale a deep breath of sea air. The clientele is mostly local. People, who want to brace themselves after a little work out in the adjacent park
5
Great place to feast on local Singaporean Hawker food. Most of the food available here is pretty authentic and great tasting. Some of the popular dishes to try are the bbq chicken wings, satay, and my fav Hokkien mee noodles. A one stop place to try all of Singapore has to offer. Much better than in eating in Air conditioned food court with overly inflated prices for factory produced food. Try and find a table as close to the beach area if possible as sitting on the inner circle can be rather noisy and full of smoke
5
on a stayover in Singapore there is only one place to eat...the East Coast Lagoon Food Centre!
we feasted on Chilli crab, peppered crab, bbq stingray, satay and hainanese chicken rice . Best hawkers food EVER!!
4
2nd best place to eat Satay, Stingray wings and drink beer by the seaside in Singapore. Take a stroll after to use meal and a paddle in the sea.
5
From the various seafood and satay places where I have eaten during this trip to Singapore this one was the best. Delicious food, laid-back athmosphere, surrounded by the very nice East Coast Park.
5
Try mutton and duck satay at this place. Simple and very tasty, including the peanut sauce! Add lime juice, sugar cane juice or a coconut to complete the meal.
5
The small food vendors selling fresh tropical fruit drinks like coconut, sugar cane or mango juice. The authentic local foods like grilled satay chicken, beef, lamb or pork are exceptional tasty. The seafood are fresh and delicious. The fish balls with noodle in soup is our favorite. We especially enjoyed the out door setting for dinner with friends at the hot weather night
3
East Coast Lagoon Food Centre is located along East Coast Parkway near Bayshore. It's a hawker centre that offers good selection of local dishes. An open air hawker centre at the beachfront. It's a little smoky here. Most of the food here are self serve. No WiFi.The few popular dishes here are namely, satay, grilled (bbq) seafood, fried hokkien mee, char kway teow, Indian rojak, mutton soup, mee goreng, coconut drink etc.Also the cheapest food (beside fastfood) available at East Coast Park
5
I do my best to always go to this place. I would estimate that there are about 60 food stalls and each one offering its own unique menu. Although there are the same items available there is usually one or two unique items to be had at each of the stalls.You can get great wings, black pepper crab, charcoal grilled prawns, clams, snails, you name it. Even fish and chips is available. Beer is really cheap. You can get two big bottles of Tiger in an ice bucket for about $16 SGD which is a bargain for Singapore. You place your order and the people come find you. I like the umbrella tables closes to the ocean sidewalk. There is a nice breeze usually, which if you know about the heat of Singapore you will appreciate. Asian cuisine is the predominant fare, but Westerners can find chicken nuggets and french fries for the kids
4
One of the few large hawker centers in Singapore that has reasonably good food stores. Several others, for example, the one at Marina Gardens by the Bay, are simply a disgrace as far as I'm concerned. Too touristy, too expensive and worse of all, the food tastes alien. East Coast Lagoon is by the beach along East Coast Parkway and I suggest going at night.
4
Eating by the beach is the best. And thats why this place is one of the best places in singapore to eat. Its worth the 20 min car/taxi ride from your hotel. It showcases a great array of local dishes especially seafood and satays ( meat on a stick ) together with peanut sauce is a must try.
5
As a Melbournite from Australia i always thought we would have thd best of everything food wise. . You wouldnt get authentic food like this anywhere ekse .. and for those who are picky with where they eat the Singaporean Health departments visit this place regularly and grade them . You will se a letter of the alphabet to show the standard of Health & Safety A - Very High B - High C - Still safe to eat .. All others are at own risk .. Teally pretty at night must have the chilly crab and sting ray
5
when I went there on Sunday, half of restaurant was closed, but still have many choice meat, drink, seafood, and more!
I had chilli crab, marinated squid, stir vegetable,fish, and more!
all food was amazing, and nice river view！
I will be back for sure!
5
Whenever I come by here to enjoy the sea view... Definitely will buy the yummy chicken wings !!! Freaking bom... I'm willing to wait even if it's 15mins.. worth it !!!! :)
5
If you are looking for authentic Singapore style seafood then this is the place. I love the chilli crabs, Sri Lankan pepper crabs, sambal prawns! Highly recommend this joint..
4
This is one Singapore's most iconic food destination that every tourist should try (locals do often). Unfortunately, it is really hard to get to without a car and a taxi ride from downtown hotel will set you so much back (both ways) that it is simply not worth it. However, if you happen to have friends with a car in Singapore, ask them to get you there - you will not regret! Food is very reasonably priced, very fresh and expertly prepared. If you intend to have a coconut, make sure you come equipped with a metal spoon as the cheap, plastic spoons you will get from any stand can't dig out the white flesh effectively (bend and break)
4
We have been her several times and we have never been disappointed. Often come back for the sea food noodles and satay.If you can, make time for a stroll along the east coast before dinner and eat dinner while enjoying the sea view.There are most locals here, which I think is a good sign; good food. The atmosphere is relaxed and people are nice and friendly.A perfect place to eat out with the whole family or even just as a couple
5
The best crab I have ever tasted is undoubtedly at this food court. I won't say it's cheap but of course reasonable compared to other seafood places in Singapore. I haven't seen much tourist as described by other reviewers rather the locals dominated. If you are in Singapore get out early tell the taxi to drop you at the east coast Starbucks then walk along the beach you will see the beautiful coastline of Singapore and would be really hungry after 30 to 40 minutes and you will see that you have reached Lagoon. Take a seat and start ordering. The sugarcane juice might be the perfect start, seafood mee goreng, prawns, sambal squids and salted egg crab ( try this instead of the regular chilly crab) to follow. We were a party if nine the bill came up around 200 dollar plus. So it was quite reasonable as well. A full satisfaction of gastronomical delight will be awaiting you
5
When visiting Singapore I recommend a visit to East coast lagoon for cheap food and drink and a very friendly atmosphere. There is plenty of choice for everyone from meat dishes to fish dishes and vegetarian Chinese to Indonesian all at very reasonable prices. There are at least 15 different stalls if not more all serving different food. All the locals eat there so it must be good. Compared to the city centre you can have a good 3 course meal for less than 10 English pounds.if you do go make sure you go after 5 o'clock as the stalls are only just opening. The setting is relaxing and nobody rushes you to order or finish your meal. Set on the coast you can watch the ships or have a paddle in the water. All in all it is a very nice place to visit and doesn't cost a fortune like the rest of Singapore. I highly recommend a visit.
4
My wife & I were recommend to eat at this place from our hotel. There are loads of stalls to choose food from. I had fried chicken rice, stay beef & chicken sticks they were very tasty. My wife had large tiger prawns cook in butter & garlic which were amazing. I would recommend a trip out there for the food experience
4
I came all the way by taxi here for Roxy Laksa. Becasue my friends and I are the Laksa lover! Well, actually, the laksa is okay but not impressive. But I think if the haze in Singapore is not so dense, it may be nice to spend an afternoon for the beach and local foods
4
Very large selection, nice location close to the beach. BUT: prices often double of what you pay in a regular hawker centre, stall owners sometimes a little too pushy, not easy to reach with bus from Bedok MRT station. In summary, a kind of beachfront, seafood themed and somewhat touristic version of a hawker center - that I would prefer over any restauran
4
Local food located at the beach. Far out of the city but worth will to visit and to eat. Offers all kind Asian food from the area. Good quality and far less tourism than Newton Hawker center. Cheaper too!!
4
This place is vast. The choices of foods,snacks,drinks and desserts here just WIN over Newton Hawker Center. The price is fair and quality is matched. Nice relaxing picnic Sunday kinda place for me.
4
This was the most scenic Hawker Center we ate at (we we went to a lot of them). Highlights here were chili crab (though there is never much actual crab), oyster omelette and a great selection of charcoal satays.
4
My wife and I have been here so many times, and will definitely return. It is a food court with so many choices. Great local Singaporean food, at very low prices. The seating area is open and unrestricted, you can sit anywhere but remember to mention your table number!We ALWAYS order the satay - it is excellent
3
Great place to get authentic local food cheap. Outside pavilions, nice scenery and plenty of options.Probably won't visit again because of the touristy feel.We went here on a rainy weekday evening so it was very quiet. This caused many of the stalls to resort to barking about their products and made browsing the different stalls really annoying. Haven't seen this behavior in other hawker centers
5
An amazing food centre for asian food lovers. There are plenty of stalls to choose where to eat from not only seafood stalls but also meat satay and lots of vegetarian options. Get yourself a fresh coconut and chilli crab or try the best laksa in Singapore at the Roxy Laksa stall. A must visit on a trip to Singapore it is located on the coast so you will be dining outside with great views out to sea
5
We had dinner here with our 2 children aged 11 and 13. I'm not a huge fan of spicy food so was a bit concerned. My first thought while going past all the food stalls was oh no chilli satay etc. My husband was in the zone as he loves this. Our kids most adventurous food is butter chicken it wasn't looking good for the 3 of us but then we found several stalls for the more bland amongst us. The location is beside the bay with plenty of sand to strill along or kids to play. The breeze was also a welcome addition. The four of us found food to suit our tastes 2 soft drinks each for the kids a soft drink and a beer for me and 2 beers for hubby came to around $50 Singapore dollars. Great venue great value. A must d
5
This is a perfect spot to take visitors on your way back from the airport to introduce them to Singaporean food. Next to the ocean and beach, large food court with good selection of seafood, BBQ stingray, chili crab, lots of satay vendors, and all the usual hawker center specialties. Prices a little higher than other food courts, but not unreasonable, and much cheaper than nearby East Coast Seafood Centre. MRT station is a long way away, and parking can be a challenge, especially on weekends. Taxi is best bet. Once you get settled and into the food, it's great
5
If I had an overseas friend visiting Singapore - this is one of the places I will bring him to experience a very local chill atmosphere. Its a hawker centre and you will have over 50 stalls to choose from - a variety of all types of Singapore food. Order your food, pay for it, tell them your table number and they will bring the food to your table. There are great seafood stalls offering the Chili Crab etc etc, great noodle soups, plenty of satay stalls (Haron is my favourite)If you can choose a table closer to the sea as it offers a better view and it more windy. You can order a few bottles of beers and chill out with the local food. Its open till late (past midnight) but some stall will close earlier.You will see a variety of people, locals, foreigners, fishing enthusiast, people on the way to the airport.A great place to be. Very casual (recommend if you wear shorts and cotton T-shirts and flipflops
5
There are a large number of food stalls here.Didnt count but guess around 40.Unreal variety as well.Prices good n cheap.Servings large.Plenty of basic seating.Like all hawker places there is assorted rubbish and some bad smells around so if that concerns you best stay away.Heigine though is first class.Food is cooked before your eyes and served promptly.We visited night time,around 9 ish.The place was packed with locals.Nearby are lots of government housing buildings and lots of the tennants come here.Daytime would be worth a visit as well.The ocean is right there.Good joint if you're in the area
1
Nothing fantastic on food. One of dishes we had chilli prawns that over cooked n VERY OILY! I think not fresh too. Addition, I find prices higher than other food centre.
4
We try one of the shop (no 38) the food was super nice and value for money. The service was great.. really enjoy the butter garlic crab. Good for big family reunion.
5
Must try the pig trotters at Han Bakuteh. The beef noodle stalk is also popular. The braised duck is good but not the best. The satay are nice with tasty gravy. Prices are reasonable.
4
A good hawker centre with a good selection of food, clean surroundings and a lovely view of the sea. You can get a good meal for two with (soft) drinks for around 30 dollars. Nice walks along the coast can start or finish here. Easy car parking
4
We rented bikes, $8 for 2 hours, then ate here. Seafood in abundance. The weather was great. The breeze made for a lovely evening. We came by taxi from Bugis, about $12, because we didn't feel like riding the bus. Much faster! To catch a taxi back to Bugis you have to leave the parking lot and hale one, thought we were going to get run over! There is no taxi stand out there were learned. Always learning, always an adventure in this fun city.
5
Singapore can be a continuous eating experience and no-one should miss a meal here. The area is clean and as cool as anywhere can be in an outdoor setting in this part of the world.With so many ‘hawker stalls’ to choose from I always find it difficult to make a choice. On my last visit our family ‘buffet’ selection consisted of chicken satay sticks, Malaysian fried rice, Hor-fun noodles, Mee Rebus, & Laksa accompanied by fresh coconut juice and fresh lime juice. Yum!Another plus with this centre is the view and breeze from the ocean and a stroll along the beach after eating
4
East Coast Food Centre looks a lot like Newton. However, it has a better setting, better food, better prices and has less hard sell. The range of food is really good. We really prefer the outdoor hawker centres to indoor. I can't recommend any specific food stalls. Everything we got was good. Try out this centre as a good alternative to the busier Newton food centre
4
Singapore is great for simple local cheap food and this place sums it up. Take your pick from a variety of stalls and make up your own buffet of fresh food and all very tasty. Yes its outdoors and can be hot and busy but that adds to the atmosphere. Can't wait to go back and have a shared meal with friends by the beach
4
After cycling along the east coast or taking a long stroll with the family,it's great to stop for a local seafood feast at the east coast lagoon hawker center. Drink some fresh coconut juice. order BBQ stingray fish on a banana leaf. add some Indonesian satay sticks made from beef mutton and chicken served with peanuts sauce and some fried local noodles. for dessert buy a fresh fruit platter and watch the sunset with your beloved ones.its a great place for lunch or dinner too
4
Singapore still has some authentic home made satay stalls like Ahmad Spring stall 58 located in this food centre beside the sea.Some places in Singapore get their Satay pre pressed in a factory from Malaysia. Not bad but this place makes the best ones by hand. The sauce is brilliant. They also do mean BBQ chicken wings.In the same centre you can find the famous BBQ stingray wings done in the blackened chillie. Yum. All the other favourites available at different stalls
3
Have many kind of food, full of tourist and local people
Fun and coast location
Travel not convenient
hot in summer
5
Our number one food experience in Singapore. The chilli crab was typically good, but so was the grilled stingray. Haron 30 satay lived up to its reputation as the best in Singapore.
4
Seafood is the famous celebrity here and they come out in a lot of variety. Black pepper crabs, grilled prawns and grilled fish are among the must-order menu when you visit.
4
Place - great place to eat after a walk, jog or exercise in the beach park. Located just beside the east coast park beach, its probably the largest 'hawker food ' centre that is prevalent in Singapore's local neighbourhood. Accessible along the ECP highway via taxi or car, just beside the former swimming lagoon and public carpark beside. Food - Great spread of Chinese, Malay, Indian and beer stalls, its one of the more crowded food centre especially on weekends. Personally I loved the Malay food here as its taste is authentic and value for $.Price - slightly higher than neighbourhood food prices for most items but generally still value for money. Tips - loved the satay here as it taste good and many outlets to choose from. Come in weekday nights especially Fridays as Sat or Sumday night would be far too crowded.
4
Fair value and variety - but mist of all it makes a pleasant change from the city. Better still, there are more bars and restaurants right on the beach if you head west from the central food halls. An easy place to relax and wander around
4
Loved to come but got to be early if wish to find a seat. Loved the satay from one of the Muslim store. Must have the lamb satay everytime I am there. The duck porridge is another of my favourite. The porridge is cooked to the right consistency and when eaten with the sauce being drizzled on it, it is really good!!! Of course, can find other local favourites. Loved its location of being near the beach which always gave it a very laid back and idyllic feel compared to other hawker centers.
3
We went to several hawker centers while in SIngapore and we were told we needed to try this one. The location was really nice, especially for lunch. A lot of stands were not open so it was tough finding what we were looking for. The food we had was good and the beers were cold! Cant complain about much, just have had better
5
We got into a taxi and asked the driver to take us somewhere to eat before heading to the airport, and we clearly stated that we were tired of overpriced food.He took us to the East Coast and dropped us off at the Food Centre. We immediately knew we were in the right place. Lots of open air tables, all different stalls selling a variety of food: grilled chicken wings, fried rice, satay skewers, beers buckets, and tons more. we sampled a wide variety of all this, for a ridiculously low price. The atmosphere was firendly, and you are right by the beach.OK you are looking at a parking lot for cargo ships since there are dozens just off shore, however if you ignore them you really feel like you are at the beach. You can also rent bikes nearby or just go for a stroll.we had a great time before getting on a plane, ate to our heart's content, and left Singapore with a smile
4
More commonly known as East Coast Hawkers this is another recommended must-do. How it is currently rated 378th I have no idea! Whenever we have first time visitors to Singapore this is the first place that comes to mind to give them a taste of the ‘old’ Singaporean atmosphere and wide variety of local food in a bustling atmosphere.This is basic dinning. Find a table, leave one of the party to occupy it, then wander around the many stalls offering a wide variety of local and regional dishes. Most stalls will deliver to your table when the food is ready (which is normally pretty quickly) and beer and limited other alcoholic beverages are available – all are at very reasonable prices.Favourites include; crispy squid, stingray, satay, seafood fried rice, otak-otak, laksa, and noodles. This is just a small sample of what is on offer.It may be a little way out of the city (on the way to the airport) but you will be guaranteed a memorable meal that won’t hit the pocket. Get there very early (before 6) or late (after 10) to have a selection of tables, particularly on the weekends, as it does get VERY busy
4
It's a long way from the center, but if you're out this way, the seaside location is excellent, especially if you can get one of the tables nearer the beach. We were with a couple of locals who did all the ordering for us. I found the food a little hit or miss. The satay and peanut sauce was outstanding. The fried rice with pineapple, a little bit of prawn, and a lot of calamari wasn't much above average. The otak-otak (fish paste, coconut milk, spices -- all steamed in a banana leaf) was pretty tasty, but it's a concotion I'm not crazy about even at its best. The grilled fish had a very tasty sauce, but the fish was a little soft-fleshed for my taste. The sauteed greens were outstanding. I guess it's like any hawker center that way; there are lots and lots of stalls and some are better than others. I suspect I would have done better ordering for my own tastes rather than going with my friends' favorites (on the other hand they picked up the tab, so I can't complain too much, can I?)
