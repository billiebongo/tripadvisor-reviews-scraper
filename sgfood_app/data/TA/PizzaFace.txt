Just picked up a fantastic tasting pizza from this little place on the main road. Very friendly staff and quick service.
5
Almost sad to say that the pizza and pasta at this place was the food highlight of our week in Singapore. None of the asian foods we tried just couldn't quite match up, great job!
5
Great atmosphere, small setting, nice decor. The service was outstanding and friendly.
The pizza is thin crust, New York style with flavorful toppings.
We have tried a few places in Singapore since relocating here, and this is our favorite.

Nice little restaurant with open kitchen. Very friendly staff, I can absolutely recommend this place! Creative facility. The food was awesome and fresh. If I have time I will come back during my stay in singapore. Thank you Pizzaface for a great dinner

We had dinner there last night and the food was delicious. We had truffle fries (portion was generous!) And pizzas which were lovely and thin, generous toppings and very tasty. Definitely recommend a visit if you are in the area.
5
After few days of struggle...finally enjoyed our meal at Pizzaface....amazing staff n owner...lovely green salad...Pizza n pasta...will have to visit again
5
I ordered the meat feast with egg in the middle and my daughter had a ham pizza with rocket, can't remember the exact names but they were absolutely superb! Perfect crispy base and loads of topping, you can't really get any better!
5
Picked 3 pizzas, and they all taste delightful. Ingredients were fresh, definitely value for money and worth the visit.

PizzaFace offers tasty and quality food, great service and prices are not crazy. After a disastrous meal at Panchatantra in Little India last weekend, I was scared to try a new place this weekend. I'm so glad we did! Given the location of this little gem, it was not busy on a Saturday night so our service was warm, prompt and top-notch. I hope it is the same during busy weekdays. We had a salad, focaccia bread and 2 vegetarian pizzas that were yummy and delivered hot from the oven! My only complaint is that, for vegetarians, the choices are limited. However, I think if they aren't busy, they are very willing to tweak items for their customers. We asked them to add spinach to the Margherita which they did. It would be nice to see a few more interesting topping options like Artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes and Kalamata olives, or a build your own option! One more vegetarian salad would be welcome too

Pizza Face was a new discovery, and much to my surprise a good discovery. A small pizza joint in Concourse Skyline, thin crust pizza is their specialty. Well prepared, good ingredients and tasty sauce. The house wine was very drinkable. I think reasonably priced. I will definitely be back.
5
Good food and good service. Will definitely come back.Do try out their black truffle pizza and latte. highly recommended.
5
I have been to Pizza Face with colleagues several times and the pizzas are great. They are thin and have just the right amount of tomato sauce, cheese and toppings to enjoy without feeling that you are stuffing yourself.
5
Constantly great quality and amazingly attentative & friendly service.
Always a great pleasure to come back!!!

If you are looking for great pizza, pasta and desserts, you GOT TO head here to try their food. When you dine here, you are not only paying for awesome food, you are paying for excellent service too! The staff here are friendly, and they ensure that you are well taken cared of.Their pizzas are made fresh, with fresh ingredients, served piping hot. You GOT TO ORDER THE CARBONARA. I swear to God, their carbonara is WORTH LICKING THE PLATE. The sauce is so rich, it is a party in your mouth. Go ahead, lick it.They serve coffee and some nice bottled drinks like Apple, Lemongrass and Ginger. You can't go wrong with these beverages.Desserts are good. Not sure if its made there, but it's delicious nonetheless.Staff would refill your glass of water regularly, and it speaks volume about their standard of service. They are polite, courteous, and they treat you like royalty. Service excellence seen here!Great ambience, with not many people (due to its location, unfortunately). However, ingredients are fresh, place is clean and ideal for meeting people. If you need a great place to talk, or to just have some quiet time, come here! The great food is a bonus!Price isn't cheap, it is true. But the quality of the food and hospitality of the staff here is worth every penny you pay. Believe me. Thank me later

My partner and I visited this place late one night and the people working here were just lovely. We were their last customers before they closed but the didn't make us feel bad or like we were inconveniencing them like some places do when you turn up near closing. Our food was delicious: traditional pizza crust like an Italian pizza with great toppings (real ham and salami etc) and the size of the pizza was huge. So too the calzone, you could easily share between two people. While it may be considered slightly expensive I found for all Western food these are the prices you were paying. Plus the portion sizes were very generous thereby halving the prices if you share a pizza. If you feel like authentic, great pizza (so nothing like your pizza hut etc) then definitely visit this little gem

We had dinner already but still chose to sample the pizza here. We ordered their signature black truffle pizza and the ingredients are plentiful, fresh and pizza is great. Initially we thought of bringing the unfinished parts of the pizza back as we were quite full already from the initial dinner, but we can't help but finish the whole piece. I must also compliment that the coffee here is great as well. Seldom do I have great pizza and coffee at the same place (we also ordered beer! Lol). The staff is very attentive and great service from them as well
5
At ~$20 (+GST) per pizza, it's not a bad price for what is some of the best pizza I've had in Singapore.Tasted great and tasted stone baked rather than on a rack. A couple vegetarian options (classic cheese, vegetarian etc) made it accessible for us.And no service charge! Which is interesting because their service is fantastic!Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a genuinely nice pizza!Cool original artwork on the wall too
5
We had a good time at PizzaFace during our stay in Singapore. The hand made pizzas were thin crust New York style and were very good to taste. The pastas were also very good to taste. We had a taste of awesome vegetarian food after 3-4 days of our stay. Very nice place to chill out with friends or better half
5
We arrived late and tired but were welcomed warmly. The staff were friendly and happy to chat about the original artwork in the restaurant. We enjoyed an excellent pizza - vegatoni, and salad.The food was freshly prepared and served with a smile. We left feeling much better than when we arrived
5
I fancied some pizza after one month travelling in Asia, so I tried PizzaFace, that was just outside my hotel, the Parkroyal in beach road. The place is very friendly, with only a few tables, but the lady and the guy inside were very welcoming, and pizza was great! If onl
5
Me and my girlfriend fancied pizza after a flight, saw this on google maps so thought we'd go! Even at 21:45 they where happy to accommodate and still provided a brilliant service
Brilliant fresh pizzas and ingredients
Would definitely recommend
5
Arrived only because courious. We tried 2 pizzas and both of them was wonderful!!! Word of italian guys. Also the service was perfect. 5 stare.

Had pizza and salad. Very tasty food and great friendly service. By Italian standards, pizza was very good along with salad. Modern place and very clean. Prices are reasonable and worth while. Would definately go back.
5
I went toPizza Face several times, lets evaluate point point by point:1) Name: is not the best name for an italian restaurant and perhaps may not give the best impression. 2) Ambiance: is a small restaurant perhaps around 1000sqf, located at the concourse in Beach road, is a hide and you really ,use look for it to find it. Inside 7 tables. Anyway is nice and simple, what it count most is the taste of the food.3) food: is really good, the pizza is at level of the best italian restaurants in Singapore. The pasta is ok, nothing wow but good, perhaps sometimes they use a bit too much cream.4) Price: is really competitive.5) staff: all very friendly and professional.To conclude, based in quality price I'll rate excellent this little restaurant. Lastly would like to highlight that I'm italian and perhaps I can have a better idea of the original taste. Therefore is really good
5
While there are other "hip" pizza places in Singapore, many of them tend to just mix a bunch of toppings to make it sound fancy, but this one manages to get the ingredients right so that the pizzas taste great. The vegan pizza was very nice, and the parma ham - gorgonzola - sweet fig one was delicious too. Their pasta offering looks really good as well. The team is very friendly and very efficient. Definitely a great pizza place, we'll be back
5
This is my 'go to' takeout pizza joint in Singapore. Really friendly service and great thin crust Italian style pizzas.Some of the best pizza I have had in S E Asia to be honest.Recommend the Salami & Chilli and the Ham, Mushroom & Gorgonzola

PizzaFace is one of the better to best small cafes I have ever been to. It's been open for around one year only now. Interesting types of pasta and pizza that is very delicious. Service was super good and we were surprised how fast the food got served. We tried the fresh grapefruit juice too and it is indeed excellent. For me that juice tasted so good too with the pasta and pizza. I am not sure but I think PizzaFace needs more customers. Largely I think that is because of the location which does not have other cafes very near by. We found it as of staying at the new hotel Premier Inn which is less than a 5 minute walk. Kudos to PizzaFace, we absolutely loved the food and your excellent service. Hope that helps !! And Helps PizzaFace too !

Strolling down the street when we found this gem of a place. Pizza surpassed our expectations and the interior design was very nice. Very good staff which made us feel very welcome from the outset. Good pricing and food made this a must re visit and 5 stars

Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon; we expected the place to be crowded, but it turned out that we were the only patrons there (possibly due to the long weekend holiday in Singapore).So we were shown to our seats promptly by the server, and we placed an order for a truffle fries ($12.00) and a Black Truffle pizza ($25).The truffle fries was fried just nice - crunchy and oozing with fragrance of the truffle oil. It was really an unforgettable truffle fries - comparable to that of House of Robert Timms (very nice as well!)The pizza came - it was quite a large portion that was enough to serve 3. I split this up with my spouse (total of 8 slices) - and boy were we stuffed at the end of the meal! The mushroom was juicy and chunky; the crust was crunchy and delectable; the cheese tasted just right!Total bill came to $39.59 - this place does not charge the usual 10% service tax and only charges the 7% GST. It's within 7-10mins' walking distance from Nicoll Highway MRT station (Circle Line), so I will definitely return to this place to try out their other pizzas in the near future.The pizza here is comparable to that of Pizzeria Mozza - both serving very excellent pizzas definitely worth a visit

From the outside, this place looks unassuming. The whole place has a very relaxed casual vibe which makes it a great place to hang with friends. But the food is the star of this place. We were a party of 10 and we ordered salads, crab linguine, bolognaise and 5 different types of pizza. The star pizza for me was the margherita and black truffle pizza. Friendly accommodating staff, great casual atmosphere and really excellent food. Don't miss this. They also deliver
5
I have been here twice now and I can truest say it is the best pizza I have eaten so far in Singapore. Also tried their pasta and it is very good as well, but I am more of a pizza lover ;)
5
This is a pizza place in the Concourse Skyline building. Small but nice, with very attentive and kind staff. But most importantly: fabulous pizza!!!!!
5
We are here with our 3 young children who were hungry so we were just expecting average pizza and food for them. Wrong! This place had excellent and very delicious pizza, yummy healthy salads, and the spicy pasta and calamari were impressive. The staff was very friendly and all smiles. I would highly recommend a stop here for after a walk down Arab street. You will not be disappointed
5
I travel the world, and have many opportunities to try pizza from around the world. It is most difficult to find good pizza, let alone great pizza, But I have finally found the Pie that takes the cake. Most excellent ingredients. the crust is thin and very delicious. Service is very friendly, and accommodating.It will be worth a trip, don't miss it !!
5
My wife and I stumbled across this place as we were passing through the area, and what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be. The walnut salad was delightful and both our pizzas far exceeded our expectations (meat lovers and calzone, mmmmh!). Will definitely be going back
5
My family has been here 3x so far and each time it's good! For the pizzas we tried the Meat Lovers Pizza and Smoked Salmon + Caviar Pizza. Both were really good! We also enjoyed the Alio Olio prawn and bacon pasta, plus the herbs in the battered Calamari Rings made it really nice
5
Called in late one night after a big day. Just down the road from our motel. Best decision we made. Absolutely awesome pizza and fantastic crew. I waited outside whilst hubby ordered and they brought me cold water while I waited. Hubby enjoyed his pizza so much we had to go back the next day before we left. If only they could deliver to Australia! Well worth the visit

Recommended by a Singaporean mate who raved about PF's pizzas. We ordered Truffle Pizza, a set lunch of Penne with Sundried Tomatoes in Basil Tomato sauce, a side Wild Rocket salad, a platter of calamari rings, and a sliceof Angel Cake for dessert. Where everything else turned out mediocre, the thin crust Truffle Pizza was delightful. The crust was light and the texture was just right, flavorful and not overbaked. Those who appreciate pizzas know the crust is the most vital component. This was a thumbs up for me. However, the topping of truffle and mascarpone cheese was, well,just a topping. It was, literally, not much to speak of. It is a watered down version because of a promotion ($15?). One hopes the version at the full price ($25) would deliver on its promises. The calamari was disaapointingly overbattered and overfried, and it turned out dry and crunchy. The Rocket salad had just a splash of dressing. So one couldn't quite decipher what the dressing was. The penne, although, al dente, was drowned in thick sauce and one could hardly find or taste the basil. Lastly, the 3-layer Angel cake fell apart when sliced with a fork. Our cake afficionados can reach their own conclusions here. Overall, a nice tiny enclave with good service but much room for improvement on delivering quality

Driving past Concourse in the evening, you will see a BIG red signs that reads PIZZAFACE. An unassuming name for a restaurant in a quiet side of Bugis with a very welcoming and friendly boss. Pizzaface serves good pizzas at relatively affordable prices. The aglio-Olio was very good and definitely worth a try - my personal favorite. I will also recommend the calamari as an appetizer to kick start the dinner
5
We ordered 10 pizzas from hear and everyone was delish. Personally my favourite is the truffle pizza but all were yummy. The lasagna went down a treat as well.The service was good too - professional and friendly.Thanks again for your help, we'll definitely use Pizza Face for our next party
