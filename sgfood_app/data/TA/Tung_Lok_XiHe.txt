This Tung Lok resturant specializes in roast duck Peking style. It is a good but not that fantastic. Cannot compare to the Peking duck in Beijing restaurant. The restaurant is well patronize and reservation in advance is a good idea. Service is average.

Order duck in advance! When it came it was excellent. Service though very average. Popular place however.

We had an early Chinese New Year lunch lohei today at their Orchard Central branch . We were told today is start of the lohei or lucky toss for CNYTotally enjoyed it. Service very good , staff was smiling and changed our plates.Food came timely and always after our earlier course has ended which is what we like as it makes us know that they pay attention to our needs.Lohei came with crispy fish skin and not too sweet along with the other condiments which we all finished Their speciality Peking duck is yummy with all the wraps and filling : they sliced it on the spot which adds to the visualCrispy Sea bass in special sauce, seafood soup had mushrooms and some sharkskin, Super yummy crispy prawns with honey sauce, mushrooms and beancurd dish, glutinous rice is also very good, and dessert.In all, all 8 of us are pleased with what we had

Had a craving for Peking duck, looked around online and found this restaurant, on TripAdvisor lots of comments, positive about the food and negative about the service.However, we had a great time, food was indeed very very good and satisfied my craving, and the service was actually very good.This young waiter, named Feng, was very good, polite and did answer to all our needs.I really recommend this restaurant, and the duck... damn good.It was super good..

Had a craving for Peking duck and around Bukit Timah so we popped in for dinner. Peking (Ireland origin) duck here is at $66 per bird. We always ask the chef to slice the duck with thicker meat. The way we like it as there is more bite. If you plan to order duck, recommend to call in advance to get the restaurant to prepare and served on your arrival as it could take up 45 mins to an hour. We also ordered our other favourite gong po prawns at $28. I had to send back my mango sago in coconut ($8.80) as the coconut flesh is too hard to even remove from the husk. I was sent a replacement immediately

Ordered 2 Peking ducks for a family dinner. Very good, but we missed the style that is just skin. Nowadays it appears as if most places do the "Hong Kong" style: first a little dish of only crispy duck skin, for eating with "popping" sugar, then a dish of breast meat for wrapping in crepes, and a separate dish of thigh meat - I like that touch of separating them. Ducks are sourced from Ireland so a little leaner - whether that is good or bad depends on your preference. Nicely presented, the other dishes were ok too. On the whole we had a good dining experience.

Went to tung lok xihe at orchard central for mum bday celebration. Made advanced reservation for a table for three and one Peking duck in advance (would recommend if you want to try their famous Peking duck because u need to wait 50 min for them to roast the duck if you order there). Duck was sliced in front of u by the three different parts and recommendations given on how to eat them (with which sauce and condiment). The duck is really good: skin was crispy with the right amount of fat underneath, meat is juicy and tender and match well with the sauces. The remaining parts of the duck can be fried with salt and pepper which is their speciality but we chose to bring them home. We also ordered the sweet and sour pork with lychee, one portion of mrs zhang lion head to share, one portion of Sakura chicken fish maw soup and mango sago with pomelo. All were good as with the usual tung lok standard. Service was good. Everyone enjoyed the food very much. Highly recommended for Chinese food lovers

The food here deserved a 4 star but the service is a 2 star! First to mention there is no crowd, the whole restaurant had barely 10 tables occupied. Once our food arrives, we were just starting to eat and the server asked if we wanted dessert! A lil too early ya... then when changing out the food into smaller plates, she pour it from 1 plate to another as if clearing rubbish... the food is yummy thou not all but mostly are above average... but the bad service just kills it all

Organised a mid-autumn lunch for a group of friends recently at the Tunglok XiHe Peking Duck restaurant at The Grandstand.The restaurant manager Sally and her staff treated us very well. They gave us a private room with personalised decorations. The food was delicious. Every dish was faultless. The Peking duck was very tasty. Esp. the duck skin with the popping sugar! Much better than the more expensive Peking duck restaurants that I've been to. They also gave us mini slices of various mooncakes with our desserts. Tea was topped up constantly. All last-minute seating changes were accommodated efficiently. It was a 5-star experience. Most of my friends vowed to return again

We celebrated a birthday there with 13 pax.Service was friendly and speedy. The ducks come from Ireland, which I guess is a safer bet than from China. Moist meat, although the skin wasn't quite as crispy as I've had in the past. Reasonable selection of wines.All the side dishes were quite tasty.The nice thing about the restaurant is that they also serve half ducks, so a smaller party can enjoy it

This will definitely be my last time here. They didn't serve the Yee Sang initially. All the other food came out already and they still dare to suggest to serve Yee Sang as last dish. Bad service overall.

Absolutely scrumptious duck and sea cucumbers. The deco was very witty and modern and was a lovely foil to the very traditional cuisine.

I've visited some refreshingly good restaurants of late and sadly this one breaks that winning streak.The first impression of the restaurant was very poor. I entered through a side door where there was one oddly positioned table. It must have been terrible to have to eat there because it was like being in a prison cell. And I noticed that after the diners left that table it wasn't cleared for ages and there was food strewn all over the floor which hadn't been cleared up.The restaurant was pretty full on a Sunday lunchtime so clearly they're doing something right. Presumably they have a method in their madness but it was a poor experience and the food was hit and miss.Their signature dish of course is Peking Duck. Admittedly, we did not order this. But it didn't look as appealing as in other restaurants and had a factory line feel about it. As for the dishes that we did order, the fried rice was pretty good and a more spicy version than you find in most Chinese restaurants. And a generous portion. But it went downhill from there. The spinach tofu was ok but nothing to write home about but we got thoroughly put off because the monkey head mushroom that comes with the tofu, was positively stale. Some of the fried dishes - you could smell the oiliness of the batter more than anything else.We were served the fried rice without bowls and it took ages to get the bill despite there being so much staff. Things like this are so annoying

If you expect a Peking duck to taste in the usual manner prepared in Cantonese restaurants, Tung Lok's Xi He duck would throw you off completely! Firstly the colour of the roast duck is a pale brown instead of the usual golden brown. The duck meat is also less fatty with more lean meat and minimum fats between the skin and the meat. Then the dipping sauces comes in at least 8 varieties, instead of the usual one sweet-salty brown sauce offered at traditional Peking duck restaurants. Instead of just enjoying the skins first, the Chef will cut up the duck completely with each serving comprising skins and meat. Finally, the bones of the duck is prepared as per your demand. I recommend choosing the salt and pepper version as the duck bones will be fragrantly fried to a crisp! Good enough to eat whole!Overall, it is an experiential meal complementing the duck meats with the various sauces! You get a visual feast too as the Chef will deftly perform the slicing of the roast duck in front of you, set in an opulent Chinese restaurant. Service staff are attentive and efficient. The ambient is great, in a beautiful restaurant with traditional Chinese decor with full glass windows lighting up the entire restaurant with sunlight in the day. Great for impressing business partners and family gatherings.

We went during the CNY period, and there was a wedding dinner going on as well. The restaurant was really very full, thus the incredible noise level. But the food was very exquisite and very very delicious. One gripe: Perhaps we can have a large Lazy Susan at each round table so that we can eat more efficiently

Tung Lok Xihe distinguishes itself from its other sister Tung Lok restaurants by its Beijing duck. Having been there several times and mindful of the high cholesterol in the delicious rolled crispy duck skin, we ordered other dishes for lunch. We were more than satisfied with the herbal chicken soup, garlic-steamed prawns, french beans fried with clams and bacon, deep fried fish with spicy sauce and seaweed tofu. For the 6 of us, we only spent $207 inclusive of taxes. And we continued with coffee at Pasarbella! Tung Lok Xihe is otherwise known as Tung Lok Grandstand

Made a reservation at 730pm Orchard Central and we were on time. Pre-ordered our peking duck in order to save waiting time. Overall the food was ok but when it's time to decide how we want the 2nd portion of the duck to be done, then we realized that we have to vacate by 830pm. If our seating is only 1hr, i think we should be inform when we made our reservation or when they are showing us to our table. But nothing was said and suddenly, the waitress told us that the choice of our preparation was not suitable as it will take 30mins but we have to vacate by 830pm as there are customers waiting outside. So we chose another method which will be faster. Of course they did not chase us when it's time but we felt slightly pressurized and finished by 845pm-9pm. When we walked out, there isn't anyone outside but well, probably they have allocated another table to the guests. We won't know what exactly happen though..

The Peking Duck is nice.But other dishes taste normal, and some rather below our expectation.We order a Peking Duck, Lobster vermicelli, 3 Egg with veg, Gong bao diced chicken, Shi zi tou (Lion Head), Mango roll, custard bun and red bean paste pastry for 4 person.The only dish worth mention and return for is only the Peking Duck. the vermicelli taste abit weird with the sauce, maybe not to our taste bud. The veg isn't nice to accordingly to my parents and my SO. Even outside 煮炒 taste better. The chicken have aroma but not tasty. As for the shi zi tou is our first time trying, so don know how it should taste like. But after tasting this we don think we will try again even if at other places. For dessert both mango roll and red bean pastry taste okay. As for custard bun, would rather go coffee shop buy.Maybe the food doesn't suit our taste bud, only the duck is nice. But at the full price, its a bit too pricey. But during Monday they do have discount for the duck at 30 or 40 plus per duck. Worth to try at least once for the duck

We had team dinner here and hosted colleagues from overseas. About 30 of us. It was crowded on a Tuesday evening. Food was good but service was slow and not up to the expectations for tunglok restaurants. We asked for cold water but were served hot water. We ordered red and white wine but after about 15 minutes, another service staff came back to verify our orders again. Replenishment of deep fried mantou for our chilli crab came after the crab was consumed. The spoon I had requested for never came. We were waving our arms for attention most of the time. We sat for a long time waiting for things to happen and most of us decided ordering dessert will mean at least another half hour of waiting and left without dessert.Food was good but you need to be very patient and forgiving waiting for things to happen.I like the pickled tomatoes (plum juice infused) served chilled - very refreshing, deep fried fish skin and the fried rice that was with bits of crunchy stuff that gave it some texture

This branch in turf city grandstand offers great Chinese cuisine while you take refuge from the crowded city centre to enjoy some greenery of the old horse-racing venue. Its chic contemporary decor with Chinese elements lifts the mood of any diner and if you order their Peking duck, its arrival at your table will be announced with a Chinese gong. Amusing! Another surprise awaits when you savor the very well-prepared duck - on top of the usual sugar and sauce, you get to eat it with popping candy, and they go surprisingly well together! Their other dishes are just as good so is their good selection of high quality Chinese tea (which the Tung Lok chain is known for). Definitely my top pick for Peking duck in Singapore

My son brought us here for his birthday dinner as he wanted to eat Peking Duck. The Peking Duck was done well and I was impressed by the display and quantity of it. Our group of 6 was almost 60% full after devouring it. I enjoyed the Fried Salmon Skin with Salted Egg Yolk as the taste was really good! Another dish that won all our hearts was the steam Soon Hock which was very tender & the slightly spicy season made the dish something we really enjoyed ally. Was not too impressed with the Kai Lan vegetable dish which was a little slightly old. Many dessert dishes were not available too and those few I tried, especially the aloe jelly was a disappointment. Couldn't find any aloe. Overall I was still quite pleased with this restaurant was the service was meticulous and the view was great.

Went to the Orchard Central branch for dinner during the CNY period. We have to pre-order their signature Peking duck upon reservation.The duck was prepared based on the guest reservation time, so it was served hot. The duck was very good and value for money. The other dishes (lion's head meatball, sautéed Prawn Balls with Honey Sauce) were good but not fantastic. The service was good too. It is a nice place for family gathering as they have big tables for group up to 15

We have dined enough worldwide to value what is good service. I am very surprised that I obtained such a bad service from one of the Tung Lok restaurants in Singapore!I bought a discounted food voucher from Groupon for Tung Lok Xihe Peking Duck.We were treated differently the moment we presented the voucher when we ordered the food.I told the manager that we just want to have simple dish. She pushed for shark fins soup, fish mow soup, hairy crabs...(all the expensive food).We ordered Peking duck. Most of the good restaurants will not charge extra fee to make the left over Peking duck meat into another dishes. We have to pay extra $10 for it. The service was bad and they didn't attend to you unless you walk to their workstation to ask for help.Check your bill carefully. They didn't deduct the value of the voucher from the total bill although the terms stipulated that you have to present it upon ordering food. When you highlighted the error to them, they pretend that they didn't know about it.Is that the strategies of Tung Lok to train the staff this way?? I will not patronize the restaurant again. It was not a nice dinner

TungLok XiHe Peking Duck has opened a new branch at Orchard Central. For the last few months now, walking by, I've seen their sign saying "opening soon". It's open now.The restaurant is at level 7 at Orchard Central. The ambiance is quite nice, a mix of traditional and contemporary.A first glance at the menu gave me the impression that it would be a very nice restaurant, but somehow, in an attempt to infuse a little contemporary taste and dabble in a little fusion, they in some way spoiled some of the dishes.I tried Mrs Zhang's Braised Lion head meatball (a very soft pork meatball on a disc of packed sticky rice), and some crispy prawns in honey sauce (which was more a fusion sauce) and some Fish slices with garlic in a stone pot.The food was ok. They had on their menu Stewed Duck's tongues in XO sauce but it wasn't available.Some of the other interesting looking dishes were Sautéed San Bei Frog with garlic and ginger, Poached fish slices in chilli spicy sauce, and Hot and sour soup with seafood.The Peking Duck itself looked nice but was only available as a whole duck (most restaurants offer whole or half duck) and since I was dining alone I didn't order it. The people at the next table however we're having it but I got the impression it wasn't truly traditional. There seemed to be some adaptation or fusion involved.I still believe, Stick to tradition. Don't ruin classic recipes

Located at turf city, bkt timah. Not accessible by public transport.Had peking duck, wagyu beef, kurobuta strips. Yummy to the max! Price matched quality. Served in a fusion style, not typical chinese method. Best not to during festive season, get more attention and better quality

When you call to book you will be asked if you want a duck cooked to order for you. I can only comment on that and the several fish dishes we added to what was an exquisitely cooked duck. We started with pancakes and the three different parts of the duck inc the crispy skin and the plum sauce plus the two other parts of the duck which were done to perfection. The breast which is the most tender and the thighs which are the most tasty. Then with our fish dishes plus noodles we were asked if we wanted the rest of our duck cooked with herbs, garlic and chillies which eats served up at the end and was excellent though too much for us. This restaurant is special

Went there for quick lunch.Tried dim sum fried carrot cake, Claypot tofu, Fish puff mee sua and Schezuan chicken. Bill came up to around $76 for 3 persons. Dim Sum is not tasty at all, very dry. The rest of the food is either too salty or tasteless. . Does not measure up to the quality of the other Tung Lok chain.Service is good but air conditioning is too hot. Although cheap for quick lunch, will not go back again

We were invited to this restaurant by Chinese Singaporean friends. They enjoy very much the main specialty here - the Peking Duck, which is served with little creps and many additions. As I am vegan, I sampled the many vegetables , noodles and topu that they offer - all were outstanding. The service was very attentive and quick.The only problem was with the horrible acoustics in the restaurant - you can not hear your friends at the same table - just the whole noise that the other tables produce.If you don't mind the noise - the food is real good.I saw that the restaurant was completly full with many happy families, with children.Another problem - there is now MRT or bus that can take you there

Went there a couple of times during weekday lunch. The food is great and the menu offers a variety of choices. The peking duck is a must to order! Service was very good too. Parking isn't an issue and the restaurant is easy to locate. Will definitely go there again
