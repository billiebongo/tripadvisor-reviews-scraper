Good food and beer with great service. Had the sausages and was good sauerkraut. Needs more Oktobrfest atmosphere for this time of year.

Dined here with friends using the Entertainer App. We absolutely loved the food and would definitely visit here again.

will definitely return.

Despite 3 tables occupied at 11.30am on 1.7, the service staff was hardly attentive.
Our glasses were empty and he comes round only once while there for 1.5 hours. A clear indication of their customer service.

One of the more authentic German restaurants that I've been to in Singapore! Portions were large and prices were reasonable. Restaurant was nice and spacious as well, and will probably be suitable for large groups.
5
Pork knuckle was very good, crispy on the outside, tender inside. Service was also very good with good recommendations. 2 platters for 12 was enough as portions was good.

Had a weekday evening dinner here and ordered pork ribs with fries ($29) and sausages with potatoes ($19). Food was good and service is friendly though they don't top up our water unless we prompt. Their elderflower pineapple mint drink is cool!

Don't bother looking for this - based on a Bavarian pretzel eatery, this bar was great for a beer but the food was never that good and not likely to appeal to the local market.If you are around River Valley, there are plenty of good eateries of all description from local to Italian to French to Japanese - Great World City is only 10 minutes walk away and it has a whole food court

Brez'n is a great place to go for a casual, delicious Bavarian meal. Portion sizes are large and the quality of the food is very good! They have a great selection of different sausages and meat platters (vegetarians won't have many options here) as well as beers and other drinks.We had the chicken sausage dish and the signature pork knuckle. It says on the menu that the pork knuckle is for 1-2 pax, and it is definitely enough for 2 people! I would also recommend getting a pretzel to start, goes very well with the beer. Prices are pretty average, so with large portion sizes I would say it is good value for the money! The setting is nothing special, just a casual restaurant in a mall.

We were looking for good European cuisine. Breeze's was a good choice. The sausages were delicious and so was the goulash. The beer was also great. The ambience was cosy and the staff very friendly.
4
Great food and service. The fries, Soup goulash and sausages are yummy. Other food we ordered did not disappoint as well. Been there twice... will definitely go back for more and intro to friends too.
5
Food was great! Restaurant accepts more than 1 Chope voucher. Went out of way to help when I only have voucher on my mobile.

There was inside seats but the server insist that it is reserved. In the end, the seats were left empty all night.

Brezn is the best Bavarian restaurant in Singapore. I have tried them all and Brezn definetely serves very authentic Bavarian cuisine. Easter offer was great with kids eating for free.
5
Came for a quick dinner and very much enjoyed the Bavarian snack platter.
Great presentation, portion generous, & outstanding food quality (sausages were awesome).
A place to return - happy every time I come.
4
Great place for a original platter that comes with ribs, sausages, sauerkraut and pork knuckles! not to forget, beer! comfortable place, great time spent!
5
Very nice staff. Excellent food and Bavarian beer.
Varied menu and normal prices
We will come again!

I would rate this place 3.5/5. Since there isnt a .5 rating. I guess i would rather round it up than down to indicate that we had a positive dining experience. My dad was happy with his meat platter, my mum was enjoyed her beer and I loved the sausages. The staff were friendly and service was good.
5
Been there a few times. Very good service and quality of food. Freshly baked Pretzels and Rosti. Enjoyed the attitude of the waiters. Beer is great and the atmosphere inside of the place is cosy even if it's at the entrance of the shopping mall and exposed to people passing by
4
It was a good dinner, with nice personalised beer labels. I enjoyed myself with my partner and will come back again in future.
4
Weekday 5-7 happy hour is a great deal! S$22 for two 0.5l beer or 2 glass of wine!
We heard another German restaurant in Dempsey is good. However, the food is quite disappointing except the sauerkraut! We especially love the pretzel here!

It was the first time for us to visit Brezn at Singapore. The very friendly waitresses offered us a special valentines menu but we decided to try the "Schweinshaxn" (Pork knuckle) with Sauerkraut, roasted potatoes and dark lager beer sauce. Very tasty! They also offer kids menu,hand-made-sausages and Paulaner-, Hacker Pschorr and FÃ¼rstenberg draft beer. We will come back to try the Brotzeit Bretl (Brotzeit platter)
5
This is an authentic German experience at (comparable) fair prices. I have tried the Gulasch, the Schnitzel and the ribs on separate occasions and, as a German, I can say the food is good. What gives this place the edge is the friendly staff, who let you forget you're in Singapore (by providing solid service like greeting you, knowing the menu, etc). All in all, a great place for German-Style breakfast, lunch or dinner

Went on a belated birthday dinner. We chose this place because we wanted to chat while our kids entertain themselves. Instead, what we received beyond that were extremely friendly and accommodating staff and our kids got to hang out with other kids from other families as well. Overall an awesome and relaxing experience.
3
Brought the family here for my Dad's birthday. He was craving for German pork knuckles and we wanted to try a different restaurant this time so we decided on Brez'n, which is also on the entertainer app (saved us 2 main course costs). The food was decent and the place was pretty quiet so we could relax and have a nice chat over the meal. Ambience is pretty simple though, nothing like Paulaner's or Kaiserhaus.
4
We were there for a Bavaria not Christmas Lunch. Food was very good. Service missed out on one obvious thing, but this is probably due to lack of training or different culture, not attitude. The location is a bit boring while the restaurant itself is nicely decorated. Food is quite good.
4
My Austrian friend said it is authentic enough to make her miss home. I think the pork knuckle is value for money and done very well, crackling skin and tender meat. We enjoyed the foods we ordered and think it is better than other similar cuisines we tried at other restaurants
5
I came with my family, including 2 boys who are overly energetic. A good thing is that there's a kids corner for them to keep themselves occupied while we could chat in peace. The food is Bavarian, sausages, pork knuckles all tasted nice and pairs well with the beers on tap. Strangely, we liked the saeurkraut the most. The service was also excellent, the staff was attentive and met any requests we had.

We had the pork knuckle and the goulash. Pork knuckle was done just right - crispy crackling, and moist tender meat. Sauerkraut that came with it was really good. Probably the best I had in SG. Other places tend to have them way too soggy/mushy. This was done just right.Goulash was very good also. The beef was flavorful and still tender. The dumpling (??) that came with it matches well with the goulash. Feels almost like I'm back in Europe!Overall, the food portion was huge, and affordable priced. With Entertainer 1 for 1, it's super good value! Definitely going back again soon
