The food was simple. Not too fancy.
Entertainer was great as it really made everything alot more affordable. Taste is good and the ambience is great

But the green curry and kailan was good!

Almost 2 years never been dine in to this restaurants. The food taste still remain the same and the food price also reasonable. Only one thing is they still shortage of staff but it seem common in all the restaurants at Singapore.

Thai food at reasonable prices. Overall service is alright and there is a membership program for a chain of restaurants too.

Really bad service! Came here with my Friend and was seated in a corner. One of the waiter totally ignored us when we were waving our hands to place our order, after 10 minutes finally she acknowledged us. We waited almost 1 1/2 hour for our dishes. After wards it came without the rice as accompaniment. The waiter must have forgot! All other tables that came later than us were served before us. Not coming here again. You have lost yourself a customer ! Really bad service ! 0/1

the standard of food served in bangkok jam has been falling over the years. decided to give it a try again since I have the entertainer app. worst decision I’ve made. ordered egg noodle with bacon and crab. its basically a dish of very salty and slimy noodles.my husband had pad thai with chicken. his review? ‘ slightly undercooked noodles coated with ketchup’.The only good thing in this restaurant is its not crowded

Good place to satisfy Thai craving. Quite affordable too! Service was fast and good. Friendly staff.

Good food, was very tasty. Decent service. Only downside is the prices. $4.50 for a coke is a bit much...and other dishes are priced slightly higher than other Thai restaurants I have visited.

Good service and food. Went for family lunch, though need to wait for a long time as there was only two waiters that time. They served with smile.

Food and drink is great although the squid was overcooked. In general, a good experience for family dinners.

The Thai food is not bad but not worth the price~ Too expensive!! Will not visit again unless there's a promotion~ =(

Service is prompt and very helpful staff. Ambience is cosy but music is abit too loud. Otherwise, all else is good.

I love Thai food, I have spent approximately 6 months of my life in Thailand through work or holidays....and as such I love going to Thai restaurants when I'm 'Kikiette' to cook:>My partener hadnt had Thai food before so we kept it simple, Tom Yum Goon and Pad Thai....The Tom Yum was delicious with a nice heat to it....so far so good.Then the Pad Thai came....i didnt think you could really make this dish badly....these guys proved me wrong....it was tasteless and the noodles were not the same as any Pad Thai I have ever eaten.....the amount of meat served was also minimal.Service was enthusiastic when you could distract them from their phones.Lots of other options in Singapore, especially Bugis, I would suggest trying them

We were so busy during the day that we had only a small window to run to the mall for dinner and grocery shopping. For dinner, we got seats at Bangkok Jam (Bugis branch) and we loved it so much we had dinner there the next day, too! Our favorites are the curries and the meat dishes (mine is the grilled pork spare ribs; most especially the yummy dipping sauce!). Perfect with steamed rice and beer. We weren't able to sample the desserts because we were already so full (and happy) with the appetizers and entrees. Will definitely visit again once in town
