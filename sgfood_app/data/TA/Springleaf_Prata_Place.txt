Cheese prata super delicious tasty , recommend cheese with egg prata. Super filling and delicious can ask for curry as sauce

Good crispy prata and for the more adventurous, a variety of different fusion prata. Self service to order and pay but they deliver the piping hot and delicious to your table. Mouth watering. Good place to go. A destination for the hungry and keen.

Springleaf specialised in pan fried prata.
The cheese prata is very crispy but a little oily.
Nice place to enjoy your meals in an quiet residential area
Parking is not a problem week days.

After catching Springleaf on the TV, my family and I decided to head down there for breakfast, and to say we were disappointed with the quality of food and service is an understatement. There's no food system, so you'll be left wondering if your food has been served to other patrons or not. I'd also like to point out that the waiters there are rude, they had scolded my family and I for not telling them what our orders were to him when he was clearly serving more than one table with the same orders.And when your order do arrive, it's cold which makes you wonder why they took so long, and the curry is self-service, which tasted terrible, really watered down, no hint of spices whatsoever.You can find better quality local Indian food at your neighbourhood heartlands for much lesser price and with better attitude

Springleaf Prata Place. Located at 57B Jalan Tua Kong, Singapore Decided to try out the much raved about Prata place, it was my first visit to Springleaf, but I was rather unfortunately disappointed by it, and though we adventured to try some of their crazy Prata creations. We ordered the murtaburger, Bryani, paper Prata, plaster Prata, masala chicken, Maggie goreng and some drinks. Prices arenâ€™t cheap for a poor disappointing Prata experience. The murtaburger that everyone raves about is blithely 2 pieces of frozen beef patties sandwiched in the Prata laden with sweet chili and mayo. Bryani was distasteful and embellishments was fusty. Appalling. The rest I do not wish to comment. Seriously I will not be back. I hope that the management will look into the quality given the contemporary praise

The place is very popular. Despite being very busy, the people running the place are nice. Given its popularity, I had thought the prata must be super. Tried the plain and egg ones. The great part about the pratas: very crispy. Nice and thin. But that's it. The plain prata was lacking in taste. The free flow of chicken and fish curry were not bad. You have to help yourself to them. The cutlery were generally wet (I suppose they can't wash and dry them fast enough). One of the cups for our coffee was chipped around the edges. The coffee was very very flat. They were nice enough to add more coffee when we brought them back. But it didn't really do much to the taste. The other positive thing about the place is the enclosed aircon seating didn't leave us smelling of cooking oil even though the kitchen was within view. Not sure if I would go back to try something else. The absence of good coffee would deter me

The parata here are very nice and freshly made after placing thr orders and tons of verity of paratas so my Squad tried numbers of different pratas with free flow of 2types of curry which was chicken and fish curry.But the parata taste so good that was no need for curry tho but free must take n try.Price is reasonable for the types of parata soguy just make your way down give it a try and keep in mind the location is good must snap pick on left over rail bridge

Visited the outlet in Thong Soon hoping for a great prata. The queue was agonizing as everyone was struggling with the self-order kiosk and payment. A staff was literally bogged with helping the customers while another lone staff was struggling to serve. Food took another 20 mis to arrive. Somehow we noticed that we were not served before those that ordered after us. Prata ordered were excellent, fresh and piping hot. Curry was flavorful with spices. A great place to have prata in the vicinity.

When i lived in Singapore and Malaysia roti part/canai was a staple for breakfast washed down with a good tea tarik. So when i visit i try to make sure i look for another recommended prata place. I tried Mrs Moghan's but they were already sold out at 10:30. I found Springleaf was well reviewed and nearby in Siglap so off i went.I had plain part, egg and bacon prata nd banana prata for dessert. The plain was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The chicken curry gravy was very good and not oily. The egg prata was crispy, fluffy and flavoursome. The banana prata was excellent - made with ripe bananas with tons of flavour. The teak tarik was good - frothy and not too sweet with solid tea flavour. None of the prata were oily - all very good quality.In addition they have a nice spacious aircon restaurant in Siglap - very luxurious for prata.Highly recommended

Each year in August since 2012 a new prata is borned, and today mark the arrival of the Prata Alfredo. On the facebook post it was described as "Chunky rosemary smoked chicken tossed in a prata filled with creamy Alfredo sauce, sprinkled with fresh button mushrooms and mozzarella cheese."Yes the alfredo sauce was indeed creamy, smooth and flavourful with the sticky cheesy mozzarella, something that could rival a Pizza Alfredo with a few more garnishings thrown in! The portion is sufficient for 2 if you prefer to share on top of other sides or a Masala Thosai

Hot & piping mutton briyani to feed 2 ? Light fluffy rice with spicy curry mutton to give your day a BIG kick !

Fusion prata at its best. It's amazing the variety there is. Must go again just to try the others that I didn't get a chance to have.
5
They have reinvented the prata!!!! The garlic cheese prata was really nice. With a little sugar on the side!!! It has something for everyone.
3
My daughter was looking forward to her portobello mozzarella prata but was a little let down. The prata is thicker, filling not well spread and not so well cooked. The same for the plain one that we ordered.

Went to the branch at Rail Mall on a Sunday morning and it was packed. You will need to find your table, go to the cashier to place and pay for your order, and the staff will bring the order to your table once ready. Aircon place made the price worthy for a good meal. A Kosong Prata cost $1.20, which is ok for an aircon restaurant
5
Was totally impressed by the prata here, as well as the service. The girl who took our orders was very pleasant and friendly, and always greeted us with a smile. She was quick to clear tables too. The prata was really tasty - between 2 of us we had 3 pratas. The masala thosai unfortunately lacked salt and was inedible. We also had a masala chicken which was great. Will definitely go bac

Basically people go here because there isn't any other prata shop in the area.Food is ok but overpriced and the service quality is lacking but the key is to manage your expectations so you won't get disappointed. Fish curry is ok, the other normal chicken one taste funny. The ventilation is nonexistent in the restaurant so be prepared to smell like what you're eating. Let's just say that it could be a lot worse..
4
Although the pratas here are crispy and delicious (not forgetting its the name of the restaurant) i feel that the key food to try here are definitely the murtabaks! the murtabaks here are the best i have tried so far! just try the umami 50 murtabak, the combination of chicken floss, chicken luncheon meat, cheese and mayo is simply oishii!

Came here for lunch yesterday after a morning of hiking. Opted for some prata and the lamb shank biryani to share with some lime juice based drinks. The lamb shank was tender and had hardly any fat on it, which made it really very tasty. The rice wasn't anything special though. No issues with the prata and curry. Overall quite decent for $25 all in

Always a good place to go after a hike to BTH (Bukit Timah Hill/ Nature Reserve); it's only around 1km away...or to view the remnants of the railway tracks which is just next to this branch of the prata makan place. As per other prata place, this prata got so many varieties of the prata, murtabak... but so far only tried what I always did: plain prata, sometimes egg prata, sometimes cheese prata...I've heard reviews of other prata variety good to try; but didn't as not that hungry enough and also the price...Prata size is definitely not as small as another famous competitor ....and the curries is also yummy and not too hot, I prefer another competitor's curry Casaurina Prata (the branch at Casaurina; the other branch's curry was just not same standard) Nice to try as the parking is currently still FREE at rail mall area, but provided queue not too long..and the hiking/ running attractions are many around that area

Known for being innovative with Salted Egg Prawns prata, mutaburger prata, portabello mushroom and mozeralla cheese, poached eggs.... quite well done. They have to improve acoustics for a better atmosphere.
4
Very good Roti Prata, Dhosai, Mee Goreng and Murtabak. Good price performance, one of the better restaurants
4
This review is for the Rail Mall branch. The place was crowded. Food was good. Ordered mee goreng, nasi goreng and prata. Prices are reasonable. Only issue was portions were a bit small.
3
Two of us ordered the egg prata. Prata was good but curry was not. Also we had to share just one serving of the curry
5
Was hanging out with my friends and we decided to find a place to have some good food and not that expensive. It was certainly not a disappointment.
Nice, Affordable & Worth the try !
Highly Recommended !

Lots of different types of prata and dishes.Prata was good and freshly made, crispy yet soft on the inside.Teh Tarik was good as well.Place is a bit difficult to get to, and parking is almost impossible to get.Restaurant is packed most of the time, and is always busy. Have to wait awhile in order to get a seats, but that means that the food is good right?Will always go there for Prata when I have a Prata cravings.Highly recommend

I had an excellent Ultimate Murtabak which at $12 is the most I've ever paid for this. Was worth it though and will go back to try other dishes. Drinks were not good -- coffee was cold, and cold drinks were watered down with too much ice.The place was packed with locals. However service was slow and indifferent, seems like the staff are struggling with the load
4
As a well travelled westerner, I love Indian Malay basic foods, particularly bread and curry sause for breakfast. This place was full and a line waiting. Found a single chair and devoured murtabak and extra roti and a pulled coffee. I wish I had room for more. So enjoyable and chea

Hi ! All I would like to share my experience with all of you , on the 26of sept 2016 at 0822am reach at Jalan Tua Kong Prata place as I was recommended by a few of my colleagues,n my worst nightmare starts when I enter n straight to the cashier and no one attend to me around 10minits standing at the cashier when a sleepy staff with a bad mood attitude came n take my order and the best part with his bad mood looks , I greet him Good morning n not even a smile or reply as I greet him don't u guys think it's shows what service are they having in their management side . Ok tats a bit only n the worst part when sending food to the tables with a sound of not happy bang sound on the table n I was so shocked even other patrons in the restaurant look at the server n cum cashier to me like it's so sad to the management. Do u think you want to come to this type of UNWANTED place even the food is good, as a customer I Guess I can say much but the management are really2 a Sleeping management if this goes on I think spring leaf Prata can forget abt doing business. Come and see for yrself I guarantee by looking at this staff looks n his attitude, I be the first if Iam the owner to terminate his service . Low class restaurant with the worst service I ever see . Omg!!

Great selection of prata (chees, onion, garlic, chocolate, banana...)The one with banana is phantastic. Ask for one cooked in less oil if you like it lighter..Smoothies are ok, not very sweet. Not sure if they make it fresh or if they use icecream/yogurt!?I didn't like the Teh Tarik
1
Understaffed and the food though appealing was unimpressive.
Had to wait 45 minutes for 3 prata to take away!
I miss Jamal's!!
4
Prata is size of a table tennis bat. Good curry and coffee. 2 Pratas and coffee for around 3 SGD per person. The restaurant is close to one of the last remaining rail bridges.
4
The mutton keema and pepper prawns are our favorite together with crispy Roti Prata and fish curry. Convenient as it is close to where we live in Siglap.
5
Heard from a colleague about a Prata Place with unusual toppings and name for their prata. Been wanting to visit for quite some time and got the chance last week. Portobello Mozarella and Mozarella Cheese Pratas (obviously I love cheese...lol) are heavenly!! Highly recommended!

Indian food has always been traditional. Springleaf changes it a bit and comes with a eggs benedict and prata, good to try once but just give me egg prata anytime.!
5
Simple Street Food in a fast food setting. But, be prepared to wait if ordering Prata. The Prata here is very nice & crispy (probably they used lots of oil) if on a diet please stay at home. The free curry served with the Prata tastes like any coffee shop or hawker center if looking for very good tasty curry maybe this not the place. This is truly simple SG fare. Other stuff Mee Goreng, Nasi Goreng served faster. Drinks ☕️ the usual SG drinks ie Milo Dino, Teh Tarik served fairly quickly.And it's a Pokestop with lots of Pokemon to catch while u wait & eat .

I went to rail mall outlet to try out their lamb shank briyani. It was a terrible decision! I waited for more than half an hour for just the briyani! When I came home I realised the briyani was not packed properly as the rice was scattered all over inside the plastic bag. But there was an even bigger surprise! The lamb shank was cold! It was as if the lamb shank was packed straight from the freezer! We heated up the lamb shank and ate it. TASTELESS! By the way the lamb shank briyani costs me $14

This is one of the various prata places that can be found in the area. What makes Springleaf stand out from the rest are the innovative dishes that can be found on their menu. Must-try dishes include the Murtaburger, which tastes like a cross between a prata and a Ramly burger, and the Prata Eggs Benedict, which looks exactly like what the name suggests. Make a trip down with family or friends and try a bit of everything

Tried out their new outlet in Rail Mall.Had Bandung that taste like tap water, no milk and rose syrup taste at all....And had their Curry Fish Head and i have the most stale fish ever and tasteless curry.Roti prata, served cold and hard prata, stiff and difficult to chew.I thought Roti prata is hard to failed and bravo this outlet did it
1
Been to this restaurant twice in the last few weeks Tried most of their recommended dishes Lamb shank biryani: no/low salt in the lamb shank: it was tasteless as a result: and that is unacceptable when one pay 15$ for it. I cook and no salt is not something that I will accept.Murtaburger: excessive cheese, the meat was cold at the centre; they threw a frozen meat patty into the murtaburger which again is unacceptable when it's served uniformly uncooked. Plaster murtabak with the egg Benedict; was excited with the idea and presentation but unfortunately didn't live up to what an egg Benedict should be like.Egg cheese prata: ordered for the kids: unfortunately the staff messed up our order and was served exactly 44 mins after we had placed the order on the counter. Unacceptable for a simple egg cheese prata which kept our kids hungry and tired. This was after I accosted them at least 5 times and even lost my patience once(it's not easy to get me to lose my patience) I'm def not going back to this place again! And while it's a popular place I am sorry to say it gets my thumbs down!
