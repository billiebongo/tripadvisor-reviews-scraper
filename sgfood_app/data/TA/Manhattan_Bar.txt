Taste one of the best Negroni that Kelvin the bartender suggest and it was amazing. The gin has been infused and brews for about 6 weeks.
It brings out the smoothness of the gin itself.
Really great work

You're going to drop some serious dough here, but the atmosphere is fantastic, romantic, and fun and the drink selection is imaginative, eclectic, and downright artistic. Hard not to win here... if you're willing to pay the substantial costs.

I tried the new food items at Manhattan bar and was blown away by how excellent the food were. Some of my favorites were rebellion burger, lobster tacos, duck spheres, pork chop with apple slices,
5
very good atmosphere, food was fantastic, service was excellent, giving us food recommendation as well. only bad was the location a bit inconvenient

I was personally sent over to the Manhattan by the bar master from the hotel I was staying at. He admired my passion for bourbon and whisky and suggested it would be worth a visit over. Thus, he sent a selfie of me to his friend at the Manhattan and note for me to deliver.Wow - what a bar! Classy, stylish and yes, a bit pricey. However, if you are looking for quality drinks, this is THE spot in Singapore. They happened to have 20 year Pappy Van Winkle, so I enjoyed a pour of that - and then I found the unicorn. I am a huge fan of Old Forester. They had a 4 year Old Forester personalized bottle that was unopened and dated back to the late 1930's or early 40's (I have since confirmed with Old Forester - it was a Saddlebred bottle often carried by men on horse). Wow - what a special pour!The staff were world-class, the bar is one of the nicest I have frequented and there is NO question that I will return if ever back in Singapore

I went to the Manhattan Bar for New Year's Eve. I was lucky to reserve a seat at the bar counter. It was a great night.The ambiance is very nice. Fancy but not too fancy. The drinks were great. There was free champagne. The food was great. The service was excellent. I've been to fancier places but Manhattan staff just shows a lot more heart. That makes the difference in my opinion. The place was packed but I didn't have any trouble ordering and getting my orders. They knew how to make guests welcome.

We only came here for drinks, and to savour the atmosphere of Asia’s #1 bar (and #7 in the world).Not being great connoisseurs of fine drinks (or bars for that matter), the experience was probably a bit wasted on us, although I did enjoy the beer I was served !The bar is pleasant enough, but maybe lacking in character, and the lighting a little dim. The drinks menu was great to peruse, and note some of the extravagant prices charged for a variety of drinks, many brands which I never heard of before.Service was attentive and friendly, and we were kept well supplied with roasted popcorn throughout.We didn’t venture in to the ‘library’, but either side of the bar entrance are two small rooms, one in which barrels are kept, and the other containing an array of bottles and flasks, which probably would have looked very much like a pharmacy in ancient days.We did reserve a table on-line to be sure we would be guaranteed a seat, but given the bar was more than half empty, this probably wasn’t necessary, although it was a Sunday evening.An interesting enough experience, but I wouldn’t rush back ..

I had drinks and a small meal here after a busy day out & about in Singapore’s markets, Little India and Chinatown areas. The drinks were the best I have anywhere. The customer service was great , so willing to listen to what we liked to drink and their suggestions were perfect. The food was a great and the music was perfect, not loud so I could still hear my daughter talking.
3
The bar is busy even on weekdays and need to book a table if you don’t mind to stand by the bar. Service is absolute amazing as servers always with smile, effective and knowledgeable. Ambience is okay. Drinks is unique. But don’t really like soggy pop corn as bar snack.Overall, not the best but worth for a visit
5
I only had the pleasure of one visit here for a cocktail, how I wish I had more! Lovely atmosphere, fantastic service without being overbearing. Started with a free mini cocktail and then complimentary snacks to go with our cocktails. I had a Kerman cocktail and would highly recommend it
4
We enjoyed a visit during our stay at the Regent Hotel. A good bar with a dark, classy atmosphere and wonderful cocktails.
4
This is a great bar , and nicely tucked away. The library room especially good if you want some privacy. Dricks are a bit expensive but the service and staff are excellent.
5
If your after a classy setting, great service and cocktails mixed to your liking this is the place. 
In order to really fine tune your cocktail experience sit at the bar and enjoy...
Really good bar food too.
5
Absolutely brilliant experience at Manhattan. We had an amazing waitress who’s recommendations were on point. The drinks were amazing and food was delicious. Especially the barrel aged cocktails.
No surprise why it’s in the top 10 best in the world. Highly recommended.
4
Classy, elegant, sophisticated, not just the ambience but the clientele it attracts.Soft luxurious sofas, pulling you into their deep depths, exotic cocktails, lulling you into the realm of "leave your worries" behind.A must go. But to look like a regular native go dressed in party wear,so that you blend. Not much to recommend in the dining, but man here you come to chill. to be seen and to see, and yes to have those tingling cocktails
5
Service and staff are amazing. Cindy was our server most nights. Very attentive and engaging. She even remembered that it was our anniversary and surprised us some complimentary cheesecake. Which was hands down the most delicious cheesecake I have ever tasted. The drinks are well made and presented. They are a trendier bar so, be advised that they do expect you to dress up a bit. Word of advice to those that prefer to dress comfortable, shorts and flip flops they frown upon. But did not turn me away. So, once was all the notice needed. The food was pretty good as well. We tried lobster tacos one evening. Perfect for sharing.
5
I had been there a few times and still found the Sunday brunch experience was awesome. There were range of cold dish, dessert, beef section and seafood section. A menu was provided, indicating that they would be serving the hot dishes (foie gras, fish, scallops etc) one at a time during the brunch session. The cocktails were included in the package while champagne will be extra charge. The service crews were friendly and professional while the seafood was really fresh and absolutely delicious
4
Love this brunch. They bring you dishes from a menu, and you can help yourself to cheese, cold cuts, salads, seafood and dessert, from the buffet tables. There's also a cool Bloody Mary room with every ingredient you can think of. The only strange thing is that it's dark so you don't see daylight
5
Went during happy hour where we got a complimentary mini cocktail, which was absolutely delicious, plus a gorgeous little toasted sandwich with every order. Also we kept eating the complimentary popcorn so the waitress kept bringing it until we had to tell her to stop! The dark cosy style of the bar works very well and the service was superb. Our waitress offered to take photos of us in the room where they barrel age some of their cocktails. Never been to a bar that does that so very impressed. The cocktails themselves are delicious and blended beautifully. It was well worth a visit and has been voted best bar in Asia this year
5
I just wanted a quiet drink to finish my business trip, unfortunately I visited the Manhattan bar on a Friday night. During the week this bar is quiet and cosy, with personalised service and great selection of food and drinks. On a Friday and Saturday, there is a waiting line to get inside. I was shown to a standing room only as soon as it was available, and then as a seat at the bar opened up, I was given a seat. The wait for drinks wasn't very long and the quality of the cocktails were outstanding
5
There wont be many places comparable - worldwide. This place will absorb you with its deco, style, briliant service and a cocktail program that has a unigue composition
5
Manhattan took 7th spot at the recent World's 50 Best Bars 2017 ranking and it's most well deserved. Very atmospheric, wonderful list of superb cocktails, great food and the service was tops. Pity about the price - be prepared to splurge.
5
What a unique place , super cool and with a fantastic bar selection and food , for friends of business you will always have a unique experience here
5
This bar was already the #1 bar on the list of Asia's 50 Best Bars when I visited. I made a reservation for my friend's birthday celebration, and we were impressed with the level of service provided, as well as the attention paid to the details of our reservation to the stay at the bar itself.Knowing that it was a birthday treat for my friend, the service staff went the extra mile to check with me over the phone beforehand, on who the recipient of the birthday wishes was, and proceeded to prepare a surprise birthday cake for her. My friend loved it, and it made the night perfect. Thanks, Manhattan Bar!Just one short month later, they have now moved up to become #7 on the World's 50 Best Bars list. Congratulations! I will revisit this bar and recommend it to my friends
5
The bar is famous and the cocktails deserve the praise. This would be a good place for a before or after dinner drink or a work drink. The beverages are on the pricier side, but no one should be surprised since it is an upscale bar inside of The Regent (a Four Seasons Hotel). The complimentary popcorn is tasty too
2
With all the hype surrounding this bar, we thought we were in for a treat, but could not have been more wrong. On arrival, it was really dark and depressing. The place was almost empty but a robotic waitress came up without a hello or welcome, just stared robotically at us.. and when we sent to sit down, just said NO that seat reserved..and that and that. We eventually found a seat in this empty bar and tried to order some cocktails. It was a FARCE! the waitresses were all wandering around with vacant looks on their faces, obviously not the greeting you expect. When trying to order, the girl had NO idea what the drinks were, what was in them, or anything. She hardly spoke English and kept saying, sorry no, sorry no. It was pathetic. After what seemed forever, it was comical, and eventually I had to ask for a simple vodka, tonic and lime, which seemed to baffle her. I wanted a cocktail,but it seemed that was far too difficult for this waitress to understand. It was a disaster. The waitresses should know the drinks menu inside out, and have a smile on their faces. There was no atmosphere, no hospitality and no cocktails for us. One of the worlds best bars?????? that is surely a joke., we have travelled the world and been to plenty of bars that would put this to shame. To be honest.. We have had better service in our local pub
5
First time visiting this bar after knowing that it’s ranked within TOP 10 in the world. Definitely wasn’t disappointed with the ambience! And great service by the crew, constantly topping up the snacks. And lastly i’m awed by how generously they allowed me to change my cocktail because I didn’t quite like the first one. Service recovery was top notch
2
Things went swimming enough as I arrived after a hard day’s work at the bar through doors which were suitably ‘exclusive’. My friend had booked a table for 6 and 4 of them had already arrived. I was excited at the prospect of exploring the best bar in Asia and was prepared for great service and great everything else. My dreams shattered soon enough. The space given to us was small and certainly not suitable for 6 people. We were placed very close to another party and any delusions of exclusivity and fun were quite quickly dashed. I could have more space at some hawker centres. I asked a hostess, Charlene, if we could have an additional chair so as to add some space. She looked blankly at me and said quite simply ‘we are not accustomed to shifting furniture around’. Well, at a price tag of more than SGD 1000 for two bottles of whisky and some finger food I’m not accustomed to such bad service. When confronted she said she’d speak to a supervisor. It took them all of 10 whole minutes to come back with an extra chair. Shockingly, desperately unpalatable.
5
From your greeting at the door to your welcome from the elegant young waitresses in black dresses and pearls, you feel transported into a special ambiance of luxury and delight. The cocktails are indeed special. Imagine a margarita using pistachio instead of Cointreau...and it works. The side dishes are delicious
5
Cocktails are amazing, so hard to choose one, or two, or three? I'm not sure how many you can drink in one night :)Not only the drinks, but the food is also superb. More like small dishes that match perfect for the bar style. Don't you dare to miss the Sliders
5
Truly a classic bar with classic cocktails and great service. the waiters in their black dresses and pearl necklaces is another classic touch. a bit dark though.
5
Cool atmosphere, good drinks, good service.
Would really recommend going there if your want a cool and chill atmosphere.
4
First class bar staff with great knowledge and experience handling their guests. A must for cocktail lovers who enjoy something a bit different in their cocktails...
5
Gorgeous retro atmosphere, attentive staff, fantastic potent cocktails, yummy food! Need I say more?
4
Excellent and trendy bar in the Regent Hotel. Excellent selection of whiskey and wines. Great cocktails - very different.
5
Lovely spot at Regent. Looks slightly intimidating walking in but the ambience quickly settles in and you feel good in this spot.
Great drinks and we had this lovely apple cheescake which was a truly tasty dish.
Definitely coming bak for more!
5
In Singapore unexpectedly I was excited to find one of the world's top rated bars was in my hotel! Alone, I was a bit hesitant but the waitress was so great I was right at home. She made wonderful drink recommendations and I enjoyed the Tuna Tacos :) Very Chic, can't wait to go back with friends
5
High class bar situated in the Regents hotel. The basic concept is an american bar added with lounge seats. The drinks are on the top level you expect from such a place. The menu is divided into sections standing for different cocktail areas. Starting with the colonization, over the prohibition area, 50ies, 60ies, umbrella-loving 80ies until today. For each decade there are specific drinks selected as well as food fitting to drinks and era.In addition drinks with ingredients from the house hickory can also be found on the menu so your normal everyday drink will definitively taste different
5
I came across Manhattan when I first stayed at the Regents' since then I fell in love with their wide range of cocktails. The service is good and can help you choose, from a verg fruity Ultima Palavra, to a stronger toned like Coal and Aged Negroni.. and finally a refreshing Fighter 69. All very peculiar tastes.. never disappointed.. a must visit in S'pore
5
From the moment you see it, you know you want to be a part of it. When you enter the bar takes you to a different place and time. It's darker but the same time cosy and lit perfectly. Tables are meant for sharing as they are quite big to seat just a couple on them. We ended up sitting at the bar. Their signature cocktails are just delicious. I had the Bellini and asked the bartender to surprise me. And he did. I got this lovely vodka based cocktails with dark berries and elderflower. It was light but at the same time you could feel the alcohol in it. My husband went for all a la carte drinks: negroni and manhattan. For us the prices were completely acceptable given we come from the Middle East. The bar team is amazing and very engaging, all of them laughing and creating a positive vibe. No wonder it's Asia's best bar. Simply awesome!!
4
Went for drinks at this nice bar at the Regent hotel. Really a gem inside. Loved the cocktails including the specials. Only drawback perhaps very dark inside.
5
I love this place! I called it "my Cheers" from my first visit! If ever in Singapore, this is a must visit bar! Great staff, cocktails, spirits, food, and ambiance! You will love this place, I promise! ❤️
5
Best bar in Singapore! Atmosphere 100%! Nothing can beat the bartenders' professionalism and quality of the cocktails. I always recommend my friends who visit to go there.
4
But that's Singapore! Has a Manhattan feel about it, the staff were attentive, the drinks were nice but that's about it for me.
5
Definitely one of the best and most elegant bars in Singapore , perhaps in Asia . Very well designed inside The Regent Hotel , fantastic service and the best drinks - great food too !
5
Love the cocktails and bar food selection. This bar needs prior reservation. I can understand why it is voted the best in Asia. The deco is "old fashion" and the ambience romantic! The waitresses and waiters are patient and knowledgeable. Can't say much about the robotic lady receptionist. The only thing I don't like are the sofa seats! They are worn, sagging and really uncomfortable for long periods of seating. The high seats at the bar seems like a better option. They also have huge tables for larger number of guests.... the tables looked why to big for any number of people. Overall, it's nice to hang out there
1
Went here after a great brunch at Basilico. But was totally looked Down upon by a hostess who ever wanted to challenge our experience there. Long story short- we went for drinks. And after 1 round we ordered another round which never came. To add insult to injury- The hostess came by to complain about the noise/ music from our table. We closed our tab. Paid the bill and she even challenged us when we left. Disgusting experience and totally not in line with a 4 seasons property. Please wake up. Manhatten used to beOne of my top rated bars but this is just bad.
4
We had heard so much about this place but getting a reservation on weekends is so difficult! Finally managed to get one and was delighted to visit this place! Well, the decor is fantastic with the dim lights, dark leather all around. The staff is friendly and efficient. Their attire is quite nice and goes well with the theme.The cocktails were hit and miss. Few of them were amazing and then there were few which were just average. We ordered some bar snacks and those were great. Do try the beer popsicles with a coating of white chocolate! It was the best thing :)Overall, was a nice experience. But yes, we have been to better bars in Singapore
2
I went to the manhattan on a Tuesday night. I expected to have dinner/ drinks with my colleagues. The drink prices were completely outrageous. Over $20 sometimes over $30 for a basic drink. I couldn't justify getting one. The dinner was absolutely not that. While food is served, it's all small plates at very expensive prices. The ziti bowl was good, but not dinner and was $20. There were some nice touches. The decor was nice, seats comfortable, and they did provide a taste of the bartenders special drink of the day.
5
The Manhattan Bar is a beautiful place to chill on any day.It's a place that is decorated in the metro style with dim lighting. The ambience was nice in the early evening and as the night went on, the crowd started to come in and it's a different place and the energy started to pick up.I liked sitting at the bar watching the bartenders doing their magic. The drinks were beautifully and skillfully made. A lively place to see people and be seen
5
Best adult only brunch.. great cocktails, excellent service and amazing food.
Must visit if you in Singapore.
5
The bar is nicely done up. Apparently they spent $4 mill on the reno. The cocktails are awesome. Forget the menu just talk to the bar staff. The bar tenders are very friendly and knowledgeable. The service is superb. All in all 7 stars
4
It was quite crowded and they were under staffed so didn't get the usual attentive service that I am used to
3
As with the rest of the hotel the staff do a great job and you can tell they are trying to be hip and original, but the drink I chose did not meet expectations and was overpriced. Atmosphere was appropriate though.
5
Fabulous presentation of exotic cocktails, accompanied by an explanation of their "history" and partnered with with various themed tapas styled food
4
Head to Manhattan Bar for an uber stylish evening complete with fabulous cocktails and superb desserts. Loved the ambience and the vibe of the place - highly recommend it.
5
Had heard about Manhattan through good reviews in many places and found the reviews were well earned!Fantastically set up bar, nice decor and setting and good atmosphere!Great variety on cocktails backed by good hostesses who could help make choices..Nice relaxed evening out and definitely a place to spend an evening out with friends
5
Beautiful located, inside a luxurious hotel Manhattan offers an amazing selection of cocktais. The service is fast and efficient. We arrived without a reservation and nothing was too much trouble. The mini burgers and the cheese board are a dream to enjoy. Recommended in every aspect
5
I can imagine walking into this bar in the 1930s in a tuxedo and drinking an expertly prepared Old Fashioned...as it turns out, I did have an Old Fashioned (of sorts) but sadly was not dressed as elegantly and it was 2017 :)Regardless, this is my favourite bar in Singapore and reputedly one of the top 5 cocktail bars in Asia and top 50 in the world....and I can certainly believe it!! Having been into their "accoutrements room" where they store all of the ingredients for their extensive list of cocktails, you can see the passion and dedication they have for mixology at the highest standards!! And just when you thought the drinks were ridiculously good, they bring out very tasty snacks and complementary drinks. Oh, and the service is top notch.Look..I could bang on for hours about how good Manhattan is, but the simple answer is....go there!! You will LOVE it.

Came here with my partner for the free flow Sunday brunch. The venue is really nice, once you're inside you don't feel like you're in the middle of a hotel. They have smaller tables at the side of the room for couples / small groups and larger areas in the middle of the room which are perfect for groups of 6 to 10 I'd say. Service was excellent.Food wise there was a seafood station serving lobster, crab and oysters, a meat station which had a full fillet of beef (replenished several times during our visit), an appetiser section containing a few canapÃ©s, a cured meat selection, a cheese selection and plenty of different bread items with jams etc and a dessert section with a wide variety of excellent cakes, cronuts, trifles etc. My partner and I are both pescatarian so didn't try the meat. The lobster was served plain, it didn't come with any kind of sauce or even butter. IMO it would be better if there was a bit more creativity e.g. a lobster roll station with hot dog rolls and butter sauce etc. The breads, cheeses and desserts were all fantastic.In addition to the above a few hot plates were offered on demand which included a potato hash and a PBJ cornbread waffle. Note a vegetarian menu is available with 5 hot dishes; tofu 'scallop', kale salad shaker, PBJ waffle, lentil & quinoa balls and potato hash. All worth trying, the lentil & quinoa balls were our favourite.Drinks were a mixed bag - on the one hand the 6 craft cocktails available were creative and different, all worth trying. They serve their own lager which is nice and one red and one white wine are also included in the free flow deal. The Bloody Mary station is excellent if you like Bloody Marys (loads of ingredients to experiment with).On the other hand no other drinks are included so if you just want a G&T it would be extra. This seems a bit silly considering you can get as many gin based cocktails as you like as long as they're on the menu and a G&T is presumably cheaper to make (for Manhattan) than a cocktail. Other brunch buffets I have been to include mixed drinks in the free flow deal.Overall a great treat but not my favourite Sunday free flow brunch in Singapore
5
Awesome! I had a great time. It's very good cocktail and very good hospitality.
Asia best bar and World best bar 50 prize 2016. It's worth going to here. Because you can feel amazing time.
BARの雰囲気、バーテンダーのテクニック、シグネチャーカクテル、サービスマンのホスピタリティ、全てが完璧！シンガポールへ来たら必ず行く価値あり‼︎
5
Very simple and clasic.Absolutly perfect night out. Our bartendar Tim was brilliant amaizing service. Definitely I will go back
5
One of my fav bars in Singapore. Drinks are spectacular, service is awesome and ambience is classy. Must-go bar in Singapore, definitely one of the best bars in Asia.
5
The cocktails are great. Try the Millionnaire or the Mad Dog. incredible and so tasty.
Service is very diligent, and everything is tasty in this trendy atmosphere
5
I came here for the champagne brunch on a Sunday for my birthday. It was an All-You-Can-Eat buffet with unlimited cocktails and food. Service was great and the ambiance was lovely. The servers even gave me a complimentary blueberry cheesecake since it was my birthday celebration. Would really recommend a visit here for special occasions! The champagne buffet is quite pricey at $150+ per person though. Best to also reserve beforehand as most people would stay there for the entire time. 12-4p
5
We were recommended this bar on a recent trip to Singapore and it was a real highlight. This classic cocktail bar was simply fantastic. The range of drinks was fabulous, and the lay out of the bar was sublime. The menu has cocktails named after every area and part of Manhattan Island. There has been great thought put into the drinks menu, and all the cocktails we tried were brilliant. We will definitely return!Be warned .... Get there early if you want a seat by the bar
5
I was traveling in Singapore solo and came to this bar twice in three days! Cocktails they made are sophisticated with beautiful layers to surprise you. Services are perfect! Bartenders are well trained with manners to serve high end guests but can also be a honest friend to advice you about your drinks. This bar has made such a memorable part of my trip.
5
Manhattan always does great Creative drinks with good service and a nice though sometimes crowded on weekends atmosphere. The manhattan drink itself is the best. Pretty unique bar experience in Singapore. The Sunday brunch is amazing. An entire room dedicated to a Bloody Mary station. Free flow wine and also 8 different cocktails to choose from. And good food from a combination of stations and off the menu
5
I am not a "cocktail' addict but I had something to celebrate and I was looking for a bar to spend my night. A friend of mine recommended The manhattan bar which is considered as a top player in the world. And I have to admit that it's true.From the atmosphere, to the service everything is done with a lot of attention and sophistication. You feel pampered and you will feel like drinking and eating the whole night :
5
The bar is a classical high-end real bar and not a club with a very sophisticated vibe and this is special in very casual Singapore. No horrible Australians in tank tops and flip-flops in this sophistacated and elegant, but aappening place. Slightly more mature crowd mostly well dressed for Singapore standards. Very professional Service and great selection of Whiskey and very original cocktails. Lively even though its elegant and sophisticate
4
Nice bar on 2nd floor of hotel Regent . Different atmosphere. Very elite. Great selection of wine and alcohol. Expensive but worth.
5
One of the best bars I've ever been to! Amazing cocktails, lot's of them barrel aged directly at the bar. If you happen to be there during Sunday, you have to try their cocktail brunch.
5
Small and intimate but also caters for small groups. Excellent service. Has great atmosphere. I was told by staff one of the top bars in Singapore.
5
Excellent bar crew that were crafting soe exceptional cool cocktail creations...very attentive and top trained! Must do for Barflys!
1
Is the worst place where you can go with friends to drink!We arrived and the place was EMPTY, we ordered 2 bottles and after 20 min we left the place because they didn't bring our drinks !Thanks to Mendoza and company I will never go back to that place!I really don't suggest this place to anyone !In 7 years in singapore this was the worst place I ever been !
5
The bar inside The Regent Hotel, Singapore, is one of the most elegant, sophisticated bars inside a hotel that I have visited in a fifty year history of heavy international travel for both business and pleasure. The world class and world renowned head mixologist sets the tone. The female wait staff in simple black dresses with pearls set the class. The design and the elegant customers set the mien. Whether staying at the hotel, or not, don't miss a unique experience in Singapore
5
This bar is to me the best thing about the Regent Singapore, it has great moody atmosphere, excellent service, attractive and friendly staff and they mix a mean drink too, almost perfect-prices are high but hey its Singapore and nothing is cheap here, i would prefer a wider selection of well priced and interesting wines but then nobody in Singapore gets wine or takes it seriously apart from restaurants like Andre and a few select others
5
Ok, once in a while you feel like a bar, a restaurant or a cafe really cares for their customers and threat them as 'guests' . Like they all should be doing, but especially in Singapore they just care about you spending money. This bar, Manhattan, is completely the opposite. Friendly, professional and good looking staff. They make sure you feel taken care off.They also have their knowledge and advise on hand in case you have a hard time making a decision on their extensive drinks menu.Hidden gem in SG and will come back!Thanks Manhattan and staff
5
A friend took us to Manhattan bar at the Regent hotel and we were in for a real treat.The space is gorgeous, consisting of a main room with a fantastic bar, two rooms that host the house-made infused liquors and herbal extracts (we got a tour by the bar manager which was really fun) and a smaller private room. We sat in the private room and very much enjoyed the bar.The drinks were so innovative, expertly prepared and absolutely delicious. We also enjoyed some finger food, which was outstanding. Add to that great service and we have a fantastic evening.We will for sure be back
5
Manhattan is a swanky bar at The Regent Hotel on Cuscaden Road. The ambience is great, cocktails are delicious and the service is top notch. You won't be disappointed. I went there with a few friends recently and we had a fantastic evening. I would give it a huge thumbs up
5
Love a place with a "mixologist". The drinks were good and the food was tasty (bar bites). The atmosphere was very inviting and enjoyed a nice couple of hours with friends...
5
Wow this is an amazing bar with all the best cocktails. Very pleasant atmosphere and great staff. Totally recommended.
4
I read about this place on a few different sites, and was not disappointed
Very friendly, professional staff, attentive, but not over attentive.
Luxurious, Stylish, and Great Drinks
5
We went to the Manhattan for the cocktail brunch,thourally enjoyed ourselves.The food and drinks were deliciouse .
5
Manhattan Bar in the Regent is a warm, cosy yet elegant bar with patrons being comfortably seated in spacious armchair settings. The cocktail menu is varied and full of interesting and thoughtful combinations. The accompanying food can be a little hit and miss. Some creations are superb, others maybe miss the mark. The staff are knowledgeable and helpful though the cocktails can be a little slow to arrive sometimes. But these are minor quibbles about a truly international bar experience
5
Fantastic concept, very knowledgable bar team, pricey however you do pay for class and attentive service.Never seen a bigger range of spirits behind a bar.Our barman made all our drinks off the menu, based on our personal tastes. Stylish design and leader in the bar scene worth a visit. Fully meet the reputation it's been given..We return!!
5
While it doesn't have the views of some bars in Singapore it does have top quality staff, excellent drinks, and a relaxed atmosphere. It was voted one of the top bars in Asia and something like 35th in the world, a reputation well earned. Would you believe that Cedric, the chief mixer dude, could not only remember when I last visited but also my wife's favorite drink? That's service. Head and shoulders above 1 Altitude and the bars at Marina Bay. If you like a good bar look no further.
5
Stayed at The Regent and went here every day for cocktails. This will be my go-to in Singapore from now on. Great interiors, super friendly bar staff, well made (delicious) drinks with all the trimmings. Do take the time to study the menu. It's worth it. A very, very cool bar that lives up to its reputation. I am missing it already
5
I stayed at The Regent so a visit was a must. unfortunately I went only for a couple of drinks as this place is just a really cool Bar! Fantastic drinks and self aged cocktails like their signature Negroni. Great service especially from the hostesses/waitresses. Sunday brunch looked really cool and for sure on my next trip to SG I will join.Well done Manhattan Team!
5
In the heart of the regent hotel lies a bar unlike any in Singapore. As you enter the Manhattan the modern music with a twist will transport you to the in sight and sound to the 1920s. This is a high end bar with a knowledgeable and friendly bar staff. I went with two other friends during velvet hour (5-7). We received a welcome drink and a wonderful sandwich style bite with our drink once we finally placed our drink orders. The bar was pretty empty when we got there but the deep rich couches quickly filled up with groups of friends and business colleagues. Sitting at the bar was a show in itself. Everything down to the type of ice is different for every drink. If you go come here do yourself a favor and have at least one scotch on the rocks. The ice alone is worth the price. A couple items of note...it is spendy but pretty reasonable considering what you get and you must be in at least business casual. Enjoy

We been there quite late after been dinner. Beside of good cocktails mixed from the 100 years barrels they also provide yummy pop corn. We haven't order others snack. But definitely come back.
4
A nice modern vibrant bar with interesting cocktail selection. Staff is attentive and friendly. Since the neighborhood is quite quiet at night, it is great to have such a bar at the hotel for guests to unwind.
5
Might be the best mixed drinks anywhere. Great atmosphere and staff. You'll be hard pressed to find a better bar anywhere.
4
But it wasn't fully booked. When I'm in the happy drunken zone I like to make friends around me (only 70% occupancy) for a laugh.. Not a chance today. Food is good but typical of this type of environment. Good laugh, environment is great pretentious and a great backdrop for bragging rights.Excellent service, the staff are fun if you engage with them

Went with friends to try a new brunch concept in Singapore and we were not disappointed.The ambient has a strong vibe to it and darkish, to keep a "evening like" atmosphere. Staff very friendly and prompt. The food is very fresh, perhaps the selection a little small (I'm a cheese lover and could always be happier with mozzarella or some good Italian cheese, which was missing), yet all was delicious. The a la carte was very nicely presented and the clmbination of flavour was unexpected but very smooth. We all ordered more.The drinking selection was my personal favourite with a fabulous Bloody Mary station and even more creative and tasty cocktails.It was a great discovery and we will be back
4
we had group of 5 and ordered different cocktails. there were some hit and miss. ramos drink didn't exactly have a nice egg white. negroni was good. will be back again to try

When you are done with pub hopping and gulping contemporary cocktails as a standard chill out , and want to step in something which is like the Elvis Presley of Rock! Step into the stylish, opulent , luxurious and quintessential New York setting at Manhattan Bar Singapore. The dimly lit and elegantly furnished bar will at first sight separate the ' boys ' from men and as you lose yourself on the large Chesterfield sofas the thoughtful service of giving a glass of water , a small sandwich and some popcorn with an aperitif will get you in the mood for a classy evening. Why I say thoughtful because very few bars practice giving water and food which hydrates you and will delay the absorption of alcohol. Anyway you will be transported to the romantic era of early 1900's as you open the carefully designed menu serving some authentic old world cocktails. The menu I am told changes every six months and reading the description and discussing the cocktails with knowledgable hostesses is quite nice. Order your drink and then lose yourself to innumerable subtle variations which each cocktail will bring you. The only bar in the world with a barrel aging room for signature cocktails will provide a riveting journey to your pallete. Get to talk to the team and the extremely talented and fit Philip Bischoff the master bar manager and you will realise why Manhattan is among the top 50 bars of the world. Give yourself time to indulge in the old world charm and do not be in a rush
4
Nice place to bring out of town guests as the bar has a nice New York theme to it. Ordering drinks though can take a lot of time so I would suggest you order at least 2 drinks at a time otherwise you will go thirsty.
3
The food can be really nice at Manhattan. We found the tables difficult to eat at as they are meant more for cocktails and hanging out. Although there were some tables that looked very well suited.The seafood was a little disappointing with the lobster being a little overcooked but the oysters were very good.The cheeses, baked goods and desert were incredible
5
The place in Singapore to go for a serious cocktail/drink.What impressed me most was the staff's knowledge of the drinks. Not just a basic high level story, but an in-depth heart felt story for what they served. Execellent!!! Furthermore they were so present and attentive!Secondly, the number of different cocktails/drinks is unbelievable! I thought I knew a lot of drinks, but now I know more ;-) Great concept and storyline behind!Lastly, I must say: "go!". You won't regret it!! You might even have to come back for more ;-
5
Love the ambience. Staffs were attentive and friendly. Awesome foods and drinks. One time visit will never be enough!
4
We had fantastic time Each time we were there. The small bites are nice to go with the wine. Whiskey and other cocktails are good too. It's pricy but worth it
5
Manhattan can be what you want it to be...Noisy, vibrant and fun or quiet secluded and romantic. It all depends on where you sit and what your mood is. Great cocktails, amazing food. Love the chocolate brownies on a stick!
5
We visited the Manhattan Bar for their Sunday brunch. The food selection, though smaller than in some all you can eat buffets, was wonderful and tasty. Service was impeccable - the staff had noted down that we were leaving Singapore for good and brought out a pastry with 'Farewell' written on it. Cocktails were great - loved the Bloody Mary stand! Also liked the vibe - no kids
5
This bar is located inside the Regent Hotel on the second floor.On arrival I was greeted but a very nice young chap who not only gave me a brief rundown on the history of the bar and the accolades it has won, but escorted me all the way to the lift. The walk up to the bar is very stylish and then you walk through into the epitome of the 1940s classic, cocktail bar. I wouldn't have been surprised to see the men all in tuxedos!! Dimly lit with with the right level of background music, the furnishings are soft and comfortable, the service is first class and the cocktails are inventive and delicious. Voted in the top 50 cocktail bars in the world and top 5 in Asia, it has its own pickling room where they prepare the myriad of ingredients for their cocktails. Absolutely wonderful. Another reason I'm Glad I'm moving to Singapore!
5
Come here to have a lovely night out in Singapore! We stayed at the Regent Hotel and were here for 2 nights in a row. Service was a tad slow but hey, it is a very busy place with not so many wait staff. The ambience and vibes were very good and staff were friendly whenever you have a chance to talk to them
5
Had the chance to visit Manhattan bar during my last trip to Singapore.The cocktails here are something else, the attention to detail is amazing; take a look at their ice, it's clear as it is triple distilled to avoid tainting the flavour of the drink!If you also want to treat yourself order some of the bars gourmet bar bites, you won't regret it.A must do if you're into your cocktails - my favourite bar in Singapore
4
Excellent selections of cocktails with different base alcohols -- I am also pleasantly surprised that they use pisco for some of the cocktails, and executed them well. As a big fan of pisco, this is a big plus of the restaurant.The ambience is very inviting, and the service was fantastic! I have to commend Seto, Sylvester, and Frank, whose energy and friendliness make a big difference to the restaurant vis-a-vis others. My friends were very impressed even from the very beginning when they were greeted with so much enthusiasm. It was a birthday celebration of one of my friends, and she was very happy with the overall experience.My main criticism will be on some of the dishes -- the roasted beef was rather hard, some of the salads were too acidic, and some of the cocktails (about 1/3 of the selection) were disappointing. The wine selection has a huge room for improvement. However, the rest of food and drinks were delivered well. I love the tequila-based drinks too!Overall, thank you very much for great experience

Near Orchard Road, the Manhattan bar serves cocktails and appetizers, well presented, in a very beautiful dÃ©cor. The place is very quiet and nice for an afterwork drink.The menu presentation was very original (see picture) - there was one section for food and drinks per neighbourhood of New York (Harlem, Upper East Side, ..) .I ordered the "Aviation" - sour cocktail, gin based with a touch of Violet (they bring a little bottle filled with a blue liquid - probably with violet - to pour in the drink). Was ok, but too strong and nothing exceptional.Then I ordered the "Main Stem", cachaca based, way too sweet for me...did not enjoy.We ordered some appetizers: tuna taco with avocado, celery and yuzu (was good but probably they forgot the yuzu or some spices - taco was really bland)Service was "too pushy" and staff should be a bit more discreet - they came too often to see if we wanted to order other drinks or food, or to tell us who came to visit the bar last week - we really didn't care! Not sure I will go back...many nicer places in Singapore
3
Have been here a number of times and there is a clear difference in service when you come here mid week and on Friday/Saturday. On weekends they just don't have enough people working and you need to wait a long time to get your drinks - you are better off ordering 2 at a time (no joke). They also don't allow holding of bottles so if you do order a bottle of whisky then you need to finish it that night (can't take it home also). The place is fun though and the crowd is decent but the slow service takes away from what is otherwise a fun place.
5
Amazing high end cocktail bar in the Regent Hotel. Music, Lighting, furniture and service are great. I have tried many drinks, they are all very good. Better reserve on weekends.
4
A very trendy bar with knowledgeable and friendly staff and almost always high-quality service. Combined with some very creative drinks, is a menu of tasty accompaniments. The music is super and fits in perfectly. A very nice place to start or end the night.
5
Was here for a cocktail masters course. The place is tucked in the Regent hotel, managed by the Four Seasons group. Absolutely loved the settings of this place, it has an old school new yoker , boot legging feeling to it. The staff were very friendly and does not chase you to make your decisions about what drinks to go for. If you really cannot find something to drink from the menu, they can even whip up something on the spot to whet your thirsty self. The most interesting thing is that the cocktails are actually barrelled up and aged for its taste. One of its kind in Singapore at the moment. The bar food was really good I must say, although price is not to mention higher than usual but it is really Four Season standard .. You will not be disappointed
5
Wonderful ambiance and imaginative drinks served in a relaxed atmosphere. The service is excellent and not intrusive. The small tapas are varied and every one was perfectly presented. The churros were the best that I have ever had anywhere. The seating is generous in space; so that one does not feel crammed next to others. I would definitely return again for a leisurely evening of cocktails and small plates that are not the typical bar food. A very nice experience
4
Looking for a quiet spot for a relaxing evening tipple? While we heard this bar can be packed on Friday and Saturday nights, it was not as busy Sunday evening (yesterday) and we managed to get two seats at the bar right away.As we only had 20 minutes to kill, we ordered two GnTs that was served up promptly. The complementary curried popcorn was tasty and fresh. Our bartender Tim was chatty and welcoming but also knew when to hang back from conversation. The bar as a whole had a cosy old school feel and thankfully doesn't try to be all things to everybody. Even though this visit started out as a time filler, we had a perfectly enjoyable time and would love to go back soon.
5
I'm not usually one for hotel bars, however this spot is a must! Located on the 2nd floor of the Regent Hotel, the moment you step inside, it's as if you've traveled halfway across the world to NYC but without the jet lag... With a swanky interior and a New York inspired menu, this is a place to spend your entire evening in Singapore. Recommend the cheese board, ahi tuna tacos & NY sour, to name just a few of the many food & drink options. Conveniently located in the Orchard area, walking distance from MRT
3
Such a big reputation with all the awards and famous lists. Nice setting and ambience. Good location in regent hotel in town. Ok to hang out with friends after work or have a romantic date night. Be very wary if you are not a cocktail person like me. The most pricey cocktails and tapas in town, with their fancy names. The latest concoction was too overwhelming with the pistachio liquor.
5
I live in Singapore, and this is my favourite bar. First of all, the interior design and lighting is very good, which creates a great atmosphere. It is spacious, but the way the tables are set, it still feels private and intimate. Comfortable seats, and a nice bar counter too.Secondly (or perhaps this should be first, because it is so rare in Singapore!); the people who work there are just fabulous! They are friendly, professional, polite and they have knowledge of what they offer. All of them; from hostess to waiters and bartenders! One feels very taken care of. They have a good sense of humour, good service and are glad to recommend drinks and flavours. It is an exclusive bar, but it is still a relaxed atmosphere and clientele, which I personally like. You can come here for drinks with friends, for business, intimate dates or solo.Thank you to all of you at Manhattan, it is a pleasure visiting you every time
5
Thoroughly enjoyed the whole dining experience with really impeccable service and exquisite lethal cocktails which were not for the faint hearted. The bloody mary station allowed for your own concoction with various condiments to choose from.Especially loved how much thought was given to the menu where the food and drinks were arranged in a way from 'light to medium to heavy'
5
We were curious as Forbes lists this bar among the top 50 in the world. Excellent service, ambiance and location. We stopped in just for a drink before going to dinner at another restaurant in the same hotel. Very comfy seating, with a fun, well thought out drink menu selection highlighting the various areas of Manhattan. Although, if you've ever been to CBGB's back in the day, the CBGB's cocktail is not reminiscent of that scene. Thank you for the Aged Negroni, the bar's signature cocktail. We look forward to returning when we have more time to lounge and also try items from your food menu
5
Excellent range of cocktails and food in a sophisticated and very cool environment. Good for couples and groups. Kick back and enjoy the afternoon.
5
Excellent selection of cocktails, spirits and small plates to pair. Luxurious atmosphere, great service and comfortable tables
5
Food, drink and service are always great. We enjoy the location, it's easy to get to
Staff is always extremely helpful. If you uncertain of what you want to order they are helpful on choosing a drink you may enjoy. I've never been disappointed.
5
All you can wish for if you like CocktailSsssssssss. During my stay in the Regent hotel I have visitit this lovely bar several times and never met such enthusiastic staff, who can tell a lot about what they serve. Perfect thanks guys!
5
The Negroni selection is excellent! High touch service and knows how to handle guests even on waitlist. Bartenders are world-class, too bad Alexander resigned. A must go everytime I'm in SG. Great place to catch up with friends!
5
This place is great for a late drink, as they have a wide range of different drinks and their whiskeys are premium and with a great atmosphere !
5
I am advised by friends that this bar is currently rated the 35th top bar in the World. We visited with friends for an evening. It is a true bar with a very impressive array of well lit bottles to choose from. There are some private rooms and also a room where the ingredients are mixed and cultivated. We were really pleased that as a proper bar children were not present. I have been told that their Sunday Brunch does not allow children to attend. Personally I applaud that decision. The staff were very friendly and good at their role. They clearly enjoyed being there. It was a great evening and we shall certainly return
4
Classy bar in the regent hotel. I went in for a drink while staying at the regent on business. The staff were friendly, helpful, and happy to have a chat to someone travelling by myself. Great selection of drinks and interesting food menu - but of course very expensive! I really enjoyed the ambience of the bar
5
FInally made it to a Sunday Brunch here in December, and we were not disappointed! Great cocktails, make it yourself Bloody Mary's, and very good red and white wine which kept being refreshed by the attentive servers. Food and atmosphere is atypical of the normal Singapore Sunday brunch scene - it feels like a cocktail bar, adults only, and the food was superb. Fresh oysters and lobster were excellent, as were the miniature bagels with home made cream cheese, the foie gras, filet mignon, poached eggs with béarnaise sauce….and the carefully crafted salads, huge cheese room with artisanal cheeses, and much more!I would thoroughly recommend for a different Sunday brunch experience - in the same price range as other champagne Sunday brunches in Singapore, the Manhattan gives you an excellent alternative option. We will return
5
We had some drinks in the Manhattan bar just before leaving Singapore. Being born in Czech Republic I was flattered by the fact that they have BECHEROVKA (a Czech national Spirit). They have a remarkable variety of drinks and some great attractions (the way how they make the Ice cubes, coctails, etc. The Manager is as Eastern European as he is a great Guy
4
Posh girly night out :) nice cocktails and ambiance, popcorns galore! Their cocktails menu is fancy, made up like a map following Manhattan and drinks very America inspired. Absolutely full on a Wednesday night. So if you come later better to book!
4
the bar is cool, the staff are fantastic but it's in the Regent Hotel which is oldie worldie american hotel...and this is trying to be cool....
great cocktails, cool service, but wouldn't come back in a hurry
5
WOW...
Just absolutely amazing, it's like stepping into the golden age of drinking. From their own aged Whisky to their own fine pickled and fresh produce. Just amazing...
4
not too rowdy for couple date, good portion can be more generous. generally nice place for first date.
5
Thank you to all your skilled mixologists for the amazing cocktails we had with my friends last week! I will strongly recommend this bar to my friends and family next time they visit.
Keep up the good work!!
5
I definitely recommend going to Manhattan Bar. It's classy and the service is just wonderful.The ambience and atmosphere of Manhattan bar will remind you much of New York city. Unlike most fancy places, Manhattan bar has an excellent service and also excellent drinks. Try the New York Sour, which is their version of Whiskey sour. I also tried something with Elder flower. It was nice and well, a girl drink.
5
Do not miss this place in Singapore. Not only the best cocktails and bar food in Singapore but as well a unique concept of Aging spirits that must be visited!!!!On top of that service is excellent and Philip Is an amazing host and manager. One word: impressive Thx
3
Ok.... This is a nice bar, perhaps the space could have been used much better, the room broken up to make it more interesting and intriguing , the bar waitresses are pleasant and I dare say beautiful but there is simply not enough staff. Singapore is notorious for poor service and all the attributes of such are on full display here.nwe spent the better part of one hour there and only managed to ever get one drink each.... This is not acceptable. Hire more people and make more money, simple as that
5
Manhattan Bar is in Singapore's Regent Hotel, but has its own character, which fits well with the Regent Hotel's upscale ethos. The interior design is excellent, evoking a classy but cool vibe, good lighting and a spectacular back lit bar with excellent selection of spirits and liqueurs. The place has comfortable sofas but one can also sit at the bar, which I did. The service is excellent, the waitresses are attentive and go out of their way to be helpful. The food also extremely well chosen, many small dishesâ€¦ the Scotch egg, the Tuna tacos, the mini hamburgers all delicious and nicely presented. But the central feature is the excellence of the cocktails. The menu has its own set of cocktails which are based on classics but always with an interesting twist. The menu is arranged around Manhattan districts - "Upper East side" etc. I sampled the Millionaire, the Penicillin, the New York Sour and the Spectrum Punch. All excellent and well balanced in their different ways. Bartenders will helpfully explain the drinks, and are very knowledgeable - especially Ashish and Gabriel. The manager of the place is a Berliner who seems to have stamped a stylish vibe on the place and has clearly motivated his team to outperform. Although I was initially skeptical I came away feeling "yes, reasonable that this is one of the 50 best bars in the world" 
5
By the second night the waiters were remembering us and our order and by the third night they were finding us a quiet table in the midst of a very busy period. The range of cocktails was impressive and on par with most cocktail bars. The majority of cocktails also offered matching finger food/bites to eat
5
Best bar experience in SG! The service crews were simply amazing & especially so for the guys behind the bar.
Never be shy to express your requests!
5
Feel awesome by having brunch at this stylish establishment. The first adults only Sunday brunch is worth trying (and spending)! The staff team members are extremely professional (and of course well dressed). The bespoke bloody mary is to die for, not to mention the "bottomless pit" oyster station and seafood station (scallops, lobsters, alaskan king crab legs)
5
A great place for cocktails and delicious bite size snacks... perfect combo for a night out drinking!Friendly staff and remarkable mixologists that quite literally can mix whatever your palate desires!And not to be missed is the outstanding Sunday Brunch! It cannot even be described in words... you really have to go experience it for yourself! Excellent spread of food and of course Manhattan Bar's superb cocktails...Must visit
5
We were served by Mark who was really friendly and great. He gave us a personal tour of the barrels store and aromatics room.
5
The Manhattan bar is a wonderful den of fun. It has great character, the service is impeccable and there is an amazing menu of cocktails to choose from. The glassware is divine. The only downside is the price, but its worth it for a very special night out in a moody bar. Wonderful experience
5
This is my number one go-to place for girls night, me-time and brunch. Fantastic vibe, good albeit small selection of whiskey, Billecart-Salmon champagne (which in my opinion is the the best cheap & cheerful champagne and can be hard to find in Singapore), memorable Old Fashion, and other cocktails that you would care to try even if you are not usually a cocktail drinker. The Sunday cocktail brunch is worth checking out with its small but high quality food selections. While the charming and very entertaining head bartender Ricky is gone now, Alex is another great guy that you can count on for drink recommendation and a knock-out concoction. I think the best gauge for a place is to ask the patron if s/he would be willing to recommend the place to friends: & yes absolutely. I've been visiting Manhattan since the second week of its opening and have recommended the bar to at least twenty people
5
The Bar sits quietly, like a stylish box, within the Regent Hotel. No sound emanates from it. But when you step inside you enter a new wolrd, like stepping through the wardrobe into Narnia. It is super-swanky, slick and very cool. Excellent waiters and very knowledgable, intelligent, bar staff and serving all the latest cocktails, gins, etc. How can a cocktail taste so much more 'fine' when properly mixed by such professional hands? - Akin to the finest chefs of the world. You'll experience it here, and no bar will ever be the same again for you.
5
was bar hopping around orchard road and started with Manhattan bar. what a great decision.amazing atmosphere and great drinks. sat at the bar and watched all the action taking place behind the bar.some great bar snacks to go with your drinks. was supposed to leave after one drink but stayed back for another. thats how much we liked the place.will be back for sure!cheers
4
This is a good spot - needs to improve on a few fronts, including food quality / size of plates but overall this is a very nice spot, with friendly staff and a good concept. Should introduce more new dishes and seek rarer spirits. Lots of potential and already a good night spot
5
For a more unusual type of Singapore brunch Manhattan is a great choice. Although the diversity of food isn't as extensive as somewhere like Mezza9 at the Grand Hyatt, the distinctive setting and excellent service more than make up for it. The food is definitely good and you can choose from a good selection of breakfast food and mains. Then there is a buffet selection with seafood, canapes and more. Cocktails come with the standard free flow brunch although you can upgrade to include Champagne as well. The setting is 1920s style New York, dark and moody and particularly good if the weather is inclement. Reserve a private room for your friends and enjoy the ambience and food.
5
Service is excellent, drinks are amazing, and the bites... pricey but definitely well prepared. Also go for the weekend brunch, expensive but excellent value.
4
I love the attention to detail at Manhattan. The food is tasty and consistently so. The selection is small but well thought out. The cocktails cover a wide spectrum. Service is excellent, and Sylvester especially is a pleasure to have around.
2
The brunch is decent - although choice of food is certainly limited. What annoys us was the refusal to serve more drinks (paid) - who boots out their customers who want to buy another bottle of champagne? The Manager of the bar was just rude!
5
Although there was a mishap with our reservation, manager and staff were really great. We enjoyed the oysters a lot as well as the variety of seafood and dessert. We will definitely come again.
5
Wasn't sure what to expect, ordered at the bar and took in tapas and a couple of outstanding cocktails. Well done for the world class service - we will remember our night with you for a very long time. Thank you from Jo and Robbie.
4
I like this bar for drinks and ambience- themed like 1940s New York. Good for groups and private events. Haven't tried the brunch yet but I hear it's great!
5
I know this will sound like the confession of an inveterate alcoholic, but when I'm in Singapore I stay at the Regent simply because I love the Manhattan bar and it is conveniently located in the hotel.The barmen are friendly, chatty when you want them to be and they make some damned good cocktails. Is it the best bar in town? I am not really qualified to judge, but it's good enough for me. "Cedric, one more Negroni, please!
5
Definitely does not feel like a hotel bar, but rather a great bar that happens to be in a hotel. Great place to come and drink at the bar during the "violet hour" because it's less busy during the week from 5-7pm and the bartenders can take some time to show their skills. Went with my husband and a friend who lives in the real Manhattan, and we had a great time. Menu set up by Manhattan regions, with both good food (small plates) and great drinks. Tipple was delicious and small sandwich with each cocktail ordered was a nice touch, but the real standout is the cocktail quality and presentation by a bartending staff who take pride in their work. The "Aviation" is just delicious, with a creme de violet liqueur made in-house. The guys loved a tequila + sangrita from the Spanish Harlem section of the menu (and I liked the the La Paloma from that same section). Always a good time chatting with the bartenders to learn more about the drink origins. Though pricey, feels like a great value because it's more a great night out than just a drink at the bar. Worth staying at the Regent just for the Manhattan as a perk...Kudos to the Manhattan staff for making this a destination bar for us, several trips running
5
The Manhattan Bar is a smaller setting than most large hotel brunch areas which gives a more intimate and certainly friendly setting than most. The bar itself looks fantastically hip and the seating is very relaxed and comfortable. There are two more private dining areas off the main bar area, and there is sitting at the bar too.Service is extremely attentive and almost too friendly, but the waiting staff carried it off well and made us feel very welcome from the outset.The cocktails which are the main theme for drinking were consistently good if possibly a little on the sweet side. The bloody mary station is fun to add a whole host of interesting foods and condiments to spice up further ones drink. The wine was also very tasty. I thought that an additional $45++ for champagne was too much (most brunches effectively charge around $30++ and the standard price already has unlimited alcohol so a bit steep in my opinion).There are five food stations encompassing: oysters; seafood; salad and bagels; dessert and cheese. On top of this one got two small plates of breakfast to start, and three hot plates (foie gras, beef short rib and a fish) cooked and brought to ones table. These dishes were all excellent.I thought the oysters and seafood were very good and the dessert selection was excellent. The cheese selection was a little disappointing but that may have been because I visited it very late in the session. Only gripe was that the green leaves in the salad area were not the freshest and a bit limp, and a toasted bagel I ordered took ages to be made which is a bit surprising given how simple it is.All in all I and my friends had a fantastic time and enjoyed the experience greatly
5
A friend was staying at the Regent in Singapore so we went back to have some drinks after being out. The Manhattan is relatively new and it's fantastic. Cocktails are in the $20 range and they arfe very, very well made. There's all sorts of theatrics going on behind the bar and Cedric, our mixer, couldn't have been more accommodating. When they found out it was our anniversary they came up with some free drinks, then a free chocolate cake! The music selection wasn't really to my taste, not really "lounge" music, and I suspect it was more to the taste of the staff. In any case it's worth a visit even if it is off the beaten track in the Regent
4
Reception: warm, friendly, welcoming
Service: attentive, courteous, smiles
Drinks: Just awesome but tad on pricey side
Food: Interesting bar bites
Ambiance: enough lighting, music tad too loud for conversations, could have been softer
Will definitely go back. Again, and again.
4
great service...as always in a Four Seasons Hotel. Very knowledgeable and provided great advice on alternatives. Excellent range of spirits and cocktails. Décor pleasant, black and leather.
Only downer was the music...not quite my taste...but then again lots of music is not.
4
Great service, delicious food and delightful cocktails, the whole experience was great!
Staff was very friendly and always there. I enhoyed specially not having kids running around or shouting. It felt a real NY enviroment.
5
Food was high quality, service was outstanding, cocktails were unique and excellent. And adult-only! Worth the price. We were there for 4 hours and no one tried to rush us out the door!
4
Fantastic atmosphere & awesome service. Great place to chill with friends. Kids are not allowed.
Love the food as well as the variety of cocktails. The only disappointment is that they ran out of Bloody Mary when we placed our order.
5
Sitting on the first floor of The Regent hotel this bar is definitely worth a visit, whether you stay at that hotel or not. Very nice display of all kinds of Whiskies.
3
Was here with a group of friends and we were sat at the huge square table right infront of the bar. It was difficult to communicate due to the sheer size of the furniture and we had to move around the table in order to catch-up. A smaller table suitable for groups of 6-7 would have made our experience at Mahattan more enjoyable. The cocktails were hit and miss, and the pricing is considered average for Singapore standards. The servers were a tad too eager in checking whether we wanted additional drinks every time our glasses hit the almost empty mark. Some might call this attentive service, but when all 4 servers working the floor intermittently do so one after another, it might turn the well-intended initiative into an unnecessary disturbance. Not exceptionally memorable, cocktail bars need to up their game in Singapore where similar competitors are a dime a dozen littered all over town.
5
We visited a few times during our stay at the Regent and thoroughly enjoyed it every time. This includes the amazing Sunday Brunch which is worth an Excellent rating on its own. Bloody Marys freshly mixed, a Cheese house, Seafood, Salads. . the list goes on. The Cocktails are not bad either, worth a visit on any given evening. The staff are excellent at their job and provide an efficient, courteous and unobtrusive service. Do visit if you have the chance.
5
Went here on Valentine's day, and experience was very good! I really loved the cocktails, may be expensive, but it was worth it considering that the cocktails are unique, not what you typically find in most bars. I tried Main Stem, and Rainbow Room Cosmopolitan, both are wonderful!The only thing lacking is entertainment, as it was Valentine's day, a songstress singing softly would have made the experience perfect
5
Visited this bar with my husband, who had been there four years prior and liked the wood paneling. We were unaware it had been completely redone, and were pleasantly surprised. Really fantastic, unique cocktails...best I've had in Singapore and just as good as best bars we like in NYC, Boston, and DC.Innovative twist on Manhattan scene with both the drinks and apps arranged by NYC regions. Absolutely best filet mignon appetizer, which we ordered 3x in one week, and every app was beautiful and delicious. Minor critique is that we found the crispy pigskins a bit too large and crispy to eat politely... Tasty, but not date food.Bartenders were knowledgeable, took great pride in the drinks they prepared. Friendly and professional, and a major reason we returned. We will be back again to sit at the bar for a memorable few drinks, apps, and dates!
5
Totally worth it. That should be the way to spend Sunday! Best cocktails brunch ever!;) No regrets! .

Singapore's first adult brunch is served with more than 6 different types of cocktails including Bloody Mary. A brunch where the cocktails are the highlights and the oysters and cold seafood including lobsters and snow crab are just the co stars. Stay throughout 4 hours to make your money's worth

Sylvester, our waiter, is a big part of how wonderful this experience was. Delicious food (very seafoody though, but they can work around if you ask politely), nice and quiet setting (so we could actually talk to eachother) and all you can drink cocktails. Perfect mix, we would go back

we have been here a few times since recent opening and enjoy the cocktails (which have steadily improved over the year) and the Sunday brunch, both of which are of a high quality compared to other similar singapore establishments. So when looking for a NYE event we shortlisted this and the 6 course menu with drinks pairing looked perfect. When we arrived we were given a nice table 2 and the canapés and 6 courses did not disappoint. Serving sizes were perfect and emphasis on taste was exceptional. Cocktails were ok but too many champagne based options for my liking. A couple were very strong which were fine for me but my wife and lady on table next to use struggled with the strong alcohol content. The overall ambience and service was (and always is) 100% first class. The manager Tomas really does do an excellent job here. From 10:30pm onwards the new year countdown began and a female DJ arrived to get some music going and the next 90 mins were excruciating listening for something that would improve the NYE party mood and maybe some old New Year's Eve classics ..... But they did not arrive. Thriller came on at one point (not my fav song) and I almost cheered at something I recognized. Looking around we did not see anyone enjoying the music and the couple on the next table to us were also suitably unimpressed by the 'house music' mix we were getting. If the crowd were 10-20 years younger then this music might have worked but at $450 per person this was not a young crowd. We left soon after mid-night not able to listen to the drone of unforgettable tunes being played

We heard great reviews about the Manhattan Bar at the 4 Seasons Regent hotel and decided to check it out. We were not dissappointed. Great selection of whiskies on offer and the bar staff were quite knowledgeable when quizzed on the different styles of whiskies. Old single malt favourites from Scotland to Japan. Decor was aesthetically pleasing which added to the ambience. Special mention to the female floor staff who was quite entertaining and very courteous! A must place to go for all whisky enthusiasts...!

It's a great place for both couples of friends to get together for drinks and bites. For people from NYC or who have been there, it's pretty interesting as the drinks and food are based on the various neigbourhoods. Service was professional and warm - 1 of the best in Singapore

My favorite bar in Singapore... Staff is attentive and knowledgeable of the cocktail menu. The mixologists (Alexander to me is the best) offered on point - and delicious - drink recommendations. To top it off the chic atmosphere (and pretty guests) makes this a place like no other in Singapore!

We arrived 10 minutes before official opening time but it was not a problem - the staff were very welcoming. There is a good range of drinks and nibbles and the atmosphere is relaxing, although it was rather dark for 5pm. One of my paryty commented tat the music didn't really fit the venue and I agreed. Perhaps they should try jazz, rather than soft rock

Booked for 10 people - had a private room, food was great, staff very attentive. Not your typical hotel seated brunch set up, think high tea with comfortable sofas. Recommendations made by the staff from the buffet counters were great especially the the bagel station which were made for you and brought to your table. Cocktail options are surprisingly complex with 6 to choose from, having tried all of them the Ward Eight was the stand out. None of the group touched wine or beer so you can definitely get your money's worth having multiple cocktails over the 4 hours. Will definitely go agai

May not have the widest spread of selections - but it got to be one of the best in class for the food selection that matters! Fresh lobsters, Alaskan crabs, Fresh North bay Oysters, a la carte Bacon & Eggs, Foie Gras, Pork Cheeks, etc. With free-flow of made-to-order cocktails - its DA BOMB

Manhattan is luxe without being pretentious, and the service here is top-notch. Servers are very friendly, drinks are excellent, and the food is great. It is pricey, but the space is comfortable, never cramped, and it's just beautiful

As a long-termer expat in Singapore and HK, I've enjoyed many brunches across many good venues. Now though I have a new favourite, with the brunch at Regent Hotel's Manhattan winning the accolade of "best brunch ever" from me and my 3 fellow diners. Getting off to a perfect start, the welcome was very friendly and the service throughout the 4 hours was attentive, informative and generally notable. Quite unusual in Singapore in my experience. Food was great, I particularly enjoyed the very fresh oysters / seafood, the bagels, and also the a la carte pulled pork and steak. The cheese board in it's own dedicated room was a nice touch. Desserts were (a bit too) moreish!Cocktails were another highlight - subtle, tasty, refreshing and with a sensible kick level that allowed us to enjoy tasting the full set (some a number of times!). I'm reliably informed that the champagne was excellent too.I'm aware that this review might come over as a bit too positive!! However, the only constructive criticism we came up with as a table was that it might be a good idea to put a warning sign on a hot sauce that was self-service at the Bloody Mary station - as it was quite easy to see how the "Temporary Insanity" sauce got it's name after I added an overly liberal glug to my cocktail. This did give me the excuse to order one more standard cocktail as a cooling "chaser" :-)Finally, the stylish décor, music, and overall ambiance of the place was what, combined with all of the above, made this our new favourite brunch destination - and a well-deserved 5* experience.P.S. I did debate adding this review at all, as ideally we'd like to keep the place as our little secret... but the careful planning behind this little gem along with the flawless execution by staff on the day means that Manhattan deserves to be a huge success. Well done.See you next month Manhattan for an already much-anticipated return trip

Located on the 2nd floor of the Regent hotel, down the far end of Orchard, is a bar that belongs at Dempsey or Holland Village. Walking past the whiskey barrels to the black front doors, I had no idea that inside would be a dimly lit, cosy jazz bar, with mirrors on the ceiling, black leather arm chairs and couches, an extensive bar, and cocktails to die for!The only things lacking are a smoking room, cigar menu, and a toilet...Unfortunately I did not try the food but I did see the weekend cocktail brunch and it looked amazing! The cocktail menu is seasonal and the food is paired with the cocktails separated into 4 distinct areas of Manhattan. I have included pictures of the current menu and the brunch flyer.Daily from 5pm - 1amViolet hour: 5pm - 7pm, Mon - FriWeekend Cocktail Brunch: 11.30am - 3.30pm, Su

Visited manhattan few times. Outstanding service from the whole team. Great ambiance, great cocktails. Selection of spirits. Best old fashioned and aged negroni in town. Yes aged...they aged it in house. Impressive. Great snacks as well

Went for a pre dinner drink, celebrating a friends birthday. First couple were told that they wouldn't serve a Mai Tai Cocktail eventually they did after a lot of fuss. After looking at the cocktail menu and discovering only 1 vodka based drink (which didn't tickle my fancy) I tried to order a Uncle Vanya Cocktail, bartender did not know the drink and still refused to make it even when I explained the ingredients. Ok so I asked for a vodka diet coke instead, but bartender wouldn't make this either has he said the sugar would ruin the vodka. (Funny I thought diet coke was sugar free) thankfully I managed to quench my thirst with a vodka tonic, (he obviously didn't know tonic has sugar. The knickerbocker beer was disgusting. Very let down with the service of this bar, will not be returning. Would not recommend to anyone.
