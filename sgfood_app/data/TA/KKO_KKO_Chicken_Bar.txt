Ordered tofu stew and chicken set, both were good. the tofu stew was perfectly cooked. Owner was warm and friendly. Come early to beat the queue!
Parking was difficult though.

I love the fried chicken here, spicy, crispy and not dry out like some other fried chicken places. The waitress the spicy garlic soy and I never look back. I also like their soups, which are refreshing after a bit too many drinks. We were even given a dish on the house and some discount coupon for returning customer on our first time.I ordered some food via Ubereats today and due to issue on Uber side, the courrier never showed up to pick up my food. The restaurant contacted me to say sorry, suggested on solution so I can still have my food without much trouble. The fault was not theirs but they genuinely owned it instead of going around who do what. That only earn them a loyalty customer in me

We had just finished an Indonesian lunch about 5 minutes before we walked by this place - but we couldn’t resist some KFC (Korean fried chicken). Who eats a second lunch only minutes apart? We do, apparently, so we kept it to one order of food (the chicken lunch set that came with wings, rice and salad). We were offered the last booth downstairs – there is more seating upstairs – right by the a/c. As we waited for the entrée, a modest plate of banchan (kimchi, dried anchovies, veggie salad) and another slender plate of complimentary apps (grapes, tomatoes, lychees, veg tempura). Appetizers kept us busy but we ate half the banchan before the entrée even came out. There were 4 small pieces of fried chicken but they were really 2 full wings – this portion was perfect for our second lunch, though. Aside from the food, we also liked the vibe of the place. Servers were very attentive, checking in on all tables. There are so many places to eat in the Arab Street area but we didn’t regret having some delicious Korean food in the midst of it all

Isn't it a law that the food should be served as shown on the menu? We went into this bar/restaurant named "kko kko chicken bar. The photo from the menu clearly showed that the dish we ordered will be served with an crab. But look at what was being served to us. It's just all fish cakes. Tastless and the only "crab" product we saw is crab meat. We ask for manager, the waiter said he is the manager, argued rudely that the photo is just for illustration. But it wasn't stated on any part of the menu. No applogy or discount was given. He even questioned us: do you know this is a bar, not a restaurant? What was he trying to say? We can't expect bar to have good quality of food and service? We asked for the waiter's name, he didn't want to give, even tear off his name on the receipt
