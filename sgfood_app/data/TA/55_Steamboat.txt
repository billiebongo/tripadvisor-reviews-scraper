Cosy place for steamboat. Menu wasn't extensive but at least the meats are of quality cuts . And the spilt soup pot - chose the refreshing tomato and the rich pork bone . Very good broths , I doubt they added MSG in it as I wasn't thirsty after the dinner, unlike other steamboat places I've been to.Ala carte buffet Dinner is S$29.90 ++ per person . We ordered a bottle of Taiwan beer and total dinner cost was around $80+. Soup base was an additional $15 which Was the reason why the total was on the high side. Service was good, 2 servers on ground . Will definitely be back again. Reservations are highly recommended .

Came here with my wife for dinner after making a reservation thru eatigo, it is quite a small restaurant but the atmosphere is really good. Both the waitress are very friendly and always smile & polite when you need to add food or refill hot water for our tea. They have 3 types of soup base : Hot spicy mala, tomato soup & pork bone soup and they will charge you $9 for each soup base. we decided to order mala & tomato soup & both are fantastic. They have all types of vegetables, seafood & meat for you to choose & once you placed the order they will serve to you in a small plate by placing it on the rack beside you.You can repeat order those food as they are all included in the price that you pay except pig brain which they charge seperately. ($5 each) All the food are fresh and we really enjoy it. The restaurant is air conditional so you dun feel hot even you are eating steamboat which is good for me as i hate to sweat all over my body whenever i eat steamboat at outdoor. You will be paying $29.80 for one person and you can order any food that listed on the menu as many times as you like except soup base & drinks
