...if they'd only turn down the ridiculous music. Really not hard to find a nice Spotify station in 2017 instead of the loud mediocre pop that's always playing.

Food was ok but the slow service took the joy out of it. In a group of five one got it quite quick in normal time. The second in our party got the plate 15min later. The rest of us got served 15min (totally half an hour!!) later. The place was not that crowded.

The food was great. We ordered a pizza and gula melaka waffle icecream with banana smoothie. Loved all of them. The service was a bit slow. We had to wait about 25mins before we were served but the food really compensated for it. The pizza (thin crust) was $15.80 and was good for two people. The ambience was great and the staff were quite friendly. Kids have two computers to play games on. If you have little ones, they would definitely love the place

Visited on a busy Sunday evening with my two daughters. I ordered the Chili Crab pasta and one daughter ordered the chicken thigh while the other ordered the pasta aglio e olio. My daughter who ordered the pasta opted for "spicy," and while it proved to be too spicy for her, I preferred it to my dish. The pasta was well-cooked and the bacon was perfect. The Chili Crab pasta was okay, but not enough crab to make it worthwhile. Next time, I'd order my daughter's pasta. My other daughter enjoyed her chicken thigh, and they also had smoothies which they demolished. I ordered an avocado shake, which had a nice consistency but very little in the way of sweetener. Probably better for my health, but not really satisfying as a drink. I also ordered a craft beer from Germany which was very good. For dessert, my daughters shared a lava cake, which I didn't sample, but they ate every bite and seemed to really enjoy it. Overall, a pleasant evening

Coffee nowhere takes their coffee seriously, running courses on coffee making. They sell all of the equipment and offer a range of hand brews including French press and V dripper.The food is surprisingly good as well and at very reasonable prices, particularly the brunch menu. the hollandaise stands up which is generally a test for me.A go to no frills brunch place to try

Have been visiting Coffee:Nowhere regularly with my family and find myself to go back again for its great combination of bar food (try the nacho fries!), tantalising desserts (Nutella pie, Thai iced tea lava cake) and great coffee. If you happen to be in the west looking for a nice place to chill out, don't miss this place

Love the ambience and setting. Tried affogato which is awesome. The clumsy wings were good too. However, the Salted egg yolk burger and Burger nowhere were disappointing. What was worse was the slow service of 2 waiters despite the fact that there were only 3 tables filled. Would be back for drinks if I have alot of time to spare, but not for the food.Scan the QR code on their menu to register an account for 10% discount and accumulate points to offset future purchase (25 points = $1)

I've been here about 3 times lately. Very nice cafe and comfortable environment with free Wifi. Not a coffee drinker but I've had some of their teas. Tea is served in a mini carafe like container and you can ask for more hot water. I was surprised regarding their extensive menu and how good the lasagna is. The Staff was very friendly
