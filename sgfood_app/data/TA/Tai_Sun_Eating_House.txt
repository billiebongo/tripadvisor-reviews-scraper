This is my 2nd time visiting sg and i always come here to eat breakfast. Theres alot of choices from vegetables to noodles and taste really good. The vendors are friendly (except for the auntie serving the coffee shop) but that is still ok. Best for budget travellers. You must try the coffee. Highly recommended.

Had fantastic prata, biryani and dosa from the Halal Indian vendor at this eating house. Seems to be frequented mainly by local residents which is always a good sign. Clean, tidy with plenty of seating and a variety of cuisines on offer from the various vendors - Thai, Indian, Chinese, Malaysian ..... Close to Lavender MRT and the V Hotel Lavender and the eating house is under cover so ideal in all weathers
