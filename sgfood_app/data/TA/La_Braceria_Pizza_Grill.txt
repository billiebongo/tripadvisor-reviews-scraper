This Singaporean restaurant serves dishes that taste like genuine Italian food.
Service is quick and friendly.
Also the house wine is very much OK.
In short; if you look for good Italian food in a friendly restaurant, this is a place to visit.

I eat here often with my family but have only recently tried the calzone. It's made with parma ham and mushrooms and it's sooo good! Will def order this again the next time.
5
We came here on Sunday for dinner, and It was so good. Service great and food came out fast as well. The pizza Carnivora was absolutely delicious, we'll be back!
5
Great food and ambience, friendly service in a cozy place. Lovely place to dine with friends and family.
5
authentic, lip smacking good food, and friendly attentive service, i left feeling satisfied and will be going back more often
5
We've been here countless times - be it for a couple dinner for two or as a group of friends looking for a good night out. Never disappoints.
5
Went there again with my kids, and again food was top, pizza for the kids and i had pasta with truffles and home made sausage with porcini mushrooms, just delicious.
Adriano the owner is a very gentle and caring person.
Thanks.

Pros - Delicious food, good portion. Parking valet service is useful.
Cons - Service staff were a little rude.

Went to this restaurant having high expectations with it being "endorsed" by the Italian embassy as blogged by one online review. The pizza was average. In fact my kids preferred the other pizza place just round the corner. Was there to celebrate a birthday, but the next table was so loud that I felt I was eating at an Italian market stall. I don't recall eating in Europe with such noisy diners ever
4
Was here with my wife 2 days back for our anniversary as my wife was craving for some Italian food. She had a crab linguine which was on point. The meat lover pizza which I had was freshly made (dough kneading could be seem from our table) - could have been more generous on the ingredients. Overall good ambience and the complimentary bread was really slick
4
Ambience was great and Italian food was delicious! Slightly pricey but will be good for special occassions. Will definitely be back for the pasta and pizza!
5
Great food and ambience at La Bracerie. Loved every bite of the food that's cooked to perfection. Am definitely going to be a regular customer.
5
Wonderful friendly neighbourhood restaurant ambience. Lots of regulars. Very tasty Italian food. Good wine list.
5
Top-notch authentic Italian fare tucked away in an unassuming corner of bukit timah. A place not to be missed!
3
Good outdoor seating on the patio and complimentary valet parking. Food was decent - we tried the Parma ham, spicy paste and a pizza.
5
Tucked away behind the main strip of Greenwood Avenue, this eatery served authentic Italian cuisine. Will definitely go there again.
5
We had a very nice and enjoyable dinner at La Braceria. Food was great - The Tomahawk Wagyu Beef yummy and heavenly, seafood soup exquisite, the Seabass fantastic and calamari fresh & crunchy!Service by Sergio was immaculate despite the full-house at the restaurant.No pretence - just solid good food and service.Reservation will be recomended!

Reservations is a must. Thank god for valet parking. Good delicious food but the service was really bad. Firstly the waiters lack the ability to serve as they seem blinded by customers requesting for them. Strange that they only look at the plates that they are carrying but not at the people who are calling out to them. I had to place my order for a glass of Prosecco 3 times before I got it. Also they need to be more clearer when they ask for our orders. I had a hard time understanding. However I must mention the Indian waiter who was very helpful in letting me borrow his umbrella. I really hope the service can be improved if we are paying service charge.
4
Location is a little out of the way for those who take public transport. Stepping in, I see a small simple restaurant but the food and service was great. Didnt really like the fish though. Pizza and truffle pasta was good! Prices were reasonable for an Italian place
5
Had a Rucola Prosciutto di Parma Pizza it satisfied my cravings for wood fire pizza!Service was excellent as well!
4
We visited on a Saturday night and were impressed with the typical Italien food in a very casual setting.
5
Loved the food, very authentic and the portions are quite huge to. Price is very reasonable. Great restaurant in a great neighbourhood.

I ultimately love the tiramisu here. All the meat dishes were perfectly done and served with excellent red wines. Ambience was superb. We all had nice dinner and had a really good relaxing time over wine.

This restaurant has poor management or arrangement with Chope reservation. Tried booking this restaurant to eat with Chope on 3 different occasions but always failed to eat there even though every time it was a successful reservation with Chope. The reason is somehow the restaurant staff would call back few hours before the reservation time to say either the booking time has to be later or there is no more indoor seating. This is very frustrating especially when there was already a confirmed reservation for indoor seating at specific time with Chope reservation. This happened 3 times with me and I must say it's totally unacceptable.Anyway I have tried the food in the restaurant before. Food is average and pricing is reasonable. It's not a big restaurant so seating is limited. Maybe they give preferential treatment to regulars and push away other reservations through other sources. But this is terrible. If they can't fulfil the booking agreement with Chope or others, please do not allow the restaurant to be booked through them.

Some weekend night we (I and my Wife) don't feel like dressing up for our date night, but yet want I be in a place that lively and most importantly serves great food. If you like Italian food and the mood is what I described above, look no further than La Braceria - a "family style" Italian place in heart of Bukit Timah residential area (hillcrest to be exact), where people mostly walk up from their homes to talk and enjoy the food.Each dish is flawless and delicious - special mention goes to the lobster linguine in bisque sauce. The atmosphere is not "chic", but friendly where people come for dates , both casual and romantic, friends hanging out, families celebrating bdays, and big groups as well.All this does make the place quite noisy- so be warned - you won't have to shout at the TOP of your voice to speak, but you can't also Whisper sweet nothings into your date's ear and hope she will get it.It's best for Long conversations with food and wine coming and going on your table and you becoming the part of the atmosphere.Apart from that - the menu is quite varying and will require at least 3 trips before you can exhaust all the items on the list that interests you.Revisit Likelihood - extremely hig

Came with a group of 8 to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our reservation was at 7pm and halfway through our dinner around 8pm, a staff came over and said we need to vacate our table!! We were not told that our reservation was only till 8.30pm when we called 2 weeks earlier to make the reservation and when we arrived at the restaurant. We had not even finished our dinner and were planning to order desserts too. We told the staff that we were not informed about this and he said the staff should have told us. So he grudgingly took our orders for desserts. We ordered desserts including the molten chocolate lava cake which we were told need 20 minutes to prepare. However, in about 10 minutes, the cake was served and the chocolate was hardened instead of being warm and "lava" like. It was obviously left sitting for a while in the kitchen and in a haste to chase us out, they just served it to us. The food quality has also deteriorated - pizza base was soggy and the pasta was quite dry. Really disappointed with the experience and we will never come again.
4
The food is really the best Italien food I have found so far in Singapore.The service is fast, its just that they could at least try to be friendly.After going there 5+ times I still cant say that the staff is friendly at all. But again, the food is awsome.
4
We went for lunch on a Sunday and were lucky to find the last table available. You should probably book before as it seems to be very popular. The service is efficient and friendly. They make their own pasta in front of you. All our dishes were simple but very good. The ravioli with tomato sauce, the burrata and prosciutto, and the spaghetti and clams. We will definitely come back
4
We had tomato soup, scallop and prawns, beef carpaccio, portobello mushroom, wagyu beef, lobster linguine, lava cake, and profiteroles. Omg, they were all so so good. My guess is if we had ordered everything, it would be just as good. The wine were also affordable. Surprising that with a restaurant that was full, the service was flawless. The owner was also warm and engagin
4
Our first visit and found a nice spot worth returning to try other menu items. The T bone was prepared flawlessly along with the truffle sausage pasta. The only one area for improvement was the bit of wilted lettuce accompanying our Burrata. Nice ambience reasonable higher ended price point and worth the extra.
4
Love the fact that they waive corkage mon-thurs. Very authentic and yummy pizzas too (the carnivore pizza is to die for!)
4
- nice Italian food
- neat and clean
- wait staffs are well trained and attentive
- good for family and group
4
There is just something about this place that makes me re-visit ever so often. I am guessing the delectable cheesecake!
4
Good atmosphere, traditional Italian food, nice parmaham, good lasagna. Nothing too complain just what you would expect
5
Authentic Italian restaurant in Greenwood, beautiful appetisers, mains and desserts that are to die for! Especially amazing we're the Profiteroles and the Braceria Cheesecake!!
5
Went to La Braceria Pizza & Grill on a Sunday evening for dinner with my family. Restaurant provided complementary valet parking services which removes the hassle of having to park your car. Service employees were also attentive and nonetheless, food was fantastic.
5
Within a neighbourhood use the complimentary valet parking. The pizzas are the best in Singapore so far. Almost reminiscent of Naples. The pizza guy looked Italian.The tiramisu was very good. The house cheesecake too.A good selection of Italian reds!We were given a limoncello cake not on the menu compliments of the chef. Very nice
5
The food is excellent with the only quibble being that the menu seldom varies so if you're a frequent diner you see the same things (plus the odd daily special). Corkage is reasonable, and waived (1-for-1) if you buy a bottle off their in-house list. Service is consistently excellent. Dine indoors or out (under cover), according to the temperature

Food was good. Was celebrating someone's birthday so we brought a cake. Disappointingly when we asked the waiters to bring it out, they brought it back out in the box and plastic bag and placed it in front of the birthday girl. I was rather surprised as other places I been would put it on a plate at least and help us to light them candles. Disappointing end to a great meal. Not the best way to celebrate someone's birthday. Sigh.
5
What's not to like about this place. Nicely tucked away, charming alfresco dining spot, great food, attentive service. We were the first to arrive at 530PM and when we left at 8PM the place was packed. People seem to love the pizza, since many patrons also order and just pick up. Glad I found this place. We shared one Antipasti platter, the pasta with crab meat, the aubergine with cheese and all 4 different pizzas. Best I have ever had in Singapore. The pizza is divine, with the perfect dough, great topping, wonderful cheese, freshly baked in a real pizza oven! Oh and don't get me started on the bread they serve. Glad we still got two large boxes left for tomorrow. Can't wait to go back there and try some of their other dishes
5
If you are for some great pizza in a restaurant with some mire atmosphere this is a place to go. Away from "very turisty" feel, it is a great place to come with your friends for sime Italian
4
Great selection of specials and a la carte. Friendly service and really tasty food. We'll definitely come back.
5
Food was excellent. Very good ambience and music and it has a nice alfresco dining area too. Weekday was perfect as it was not too crowded. Staff was friendly and we got a chance to meet and chat with the executive chef Giovanni. Heard that President Tony Tan and his family frequented the place on weekend too
4
Was pleasantly surprised to discover this charming place @ Greenwood The setting was very welcoming - especially the alfresco space just outside the restaurant's entrance Unlike the other dining spots along the main road, La Bracerie is tucked away from the traffic - excellent atmosphere to enjoy a sip & munch The yummy food we had were a feast for both the eyes and tummy. Must try - the calamari & spaghetti & tiramisu
4
Italian is our go-to cuisine for special occasions Although parking is an absolute nightmare (expected it though, it's in the middle of a housing estate), would love to come back here again. Food was excellent - my favourite is the crab linguine. & everything arrived very quickly on the table. Very pleasant dining experience What we ordered:Crab Meat Linguine ($24++)Mushroom Risotto ($24++)Penne Bolognese ($19++) Prosciutto e Funghi Pizza ($23++) Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats available☀ Alfresco seats available Accepts reservations - I used Chope️ Parking is almost non-existent (located in a housing estate

There is something particularly authentic about this restaurant's food. The atmosphere is lovely once you are seated. We'd walked past for almost two years and like many people were possibly unsure of the spot between the vet and the convenience store. Yet its plants create natural screens and the good service quickly warms you to the place. We took our two small dogs for lunch with us and they were promptly brought a water bowl. As they lazed under our table, we watched a tropical downpour and feasted on calamari, then a calzone and veal for mains. The wine list is truly impressive. Someone knows how to bring food, wine and service together in a convenient location. It is walking distance for us, perfect. We will be back! Grazie!

On a public holiday, when we arrived, our party of five was told that there was something wrong with the online reservation system. It was "sorry, we have no table for you actually". The staff was focused on telling me I should pick up my phone, they tried to call me to cancel. I received two confirmation emails from Hungrygowhere. Do I need to wait for a phone call?There was no service recovery, no offer of any alternatives (takeaway?), just efforts trying to shift the blame of the mix up, instead of minimising the inconvenience of customers who drove all the way and end up with no table at 7.30pm
4
Made a reservation for dinner via the restaurant online apps, did get an email reply with details clearly indicated, however, our reservation was not found on the list. Sort of rocky way to start off the evening, fortunately, waiting staff made a quick decision and got us a table immediately.Things went uphill thereafter, staff are very professional and attentive, food and wine are impressive, one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. Shall come back again with hope to have a smooth reservation procedure

Busy Sunday evening at La Braceria. Service was prompt when taking the orders but the main courses arrived over a 30 minute period which was unsatisfactory, as one guest finished her pasta meal, when others hadn't even received their pizzas. An observation was that many delivery companies were picking up pizzas for delivery & this could have added to the 30 minute wait for three pizzas. The food was super when it arrived but the service post order was poor
3
1st time trying out this restaurant as it had raving reviews based on my online research, and made a reservation through Chope booking about 1 week earlier. Came here to have a simple birthday dinner with my boyfriend.Got seated relatively quickly but was approached at least 3/4 times by the head waiter to confirm my reservation and name which was mildly annoying. Restaurant was packed with families and couples! Was excited to see what was on the menu. Loved the outdoor seating where pets can be brought too!Ordered the crab pasta, half-half pizza (Alla Braceria and Parma Ham), calamari and cheesecake within minutes. However, it took about 15 minutes for them to bring us the complimentary bread basket which was really frustrating as you can see their waitresses/waiters getting stretched - having to cope with so many tables/requests + we were getting hungry! Had to ask 3 times for the bread basket before it came.Food was served very quickly (except the calamari) and we started digging in.Crab pasta was to die for but the pizza despite tasting authentic and fresh, could have afforded to have more taste! A tad too bland for our liking. We realised our calamari hasn't reached us yet even though we were nearly 80% done, and checked with the waitresses at least twice to confirm if they were coming. Only after 15 minutes, did one waitress approached the head waiter and told him our concern..Which he told us that the calamari was not entered into the order from the start (this was frustrating yet a blessing in disguise because it was HIM who took our orders at the start yet he missed out on the order.. However we were too full for the calamari so we decided to shelve it).Cheesecake was really a must-try! Smooth and delicious, nothing like any other cheesecakes.In general, the pastas look and taste really good but would give pizzas a miss the next time. Would have loved to try more variety so will be back. Service on the other hand is quite disappointing and marred a pleasant experience. Half the time, it seems as though the waitresses do not register what customers are asking despite nodding their heads. This results in customers requesting multiple times and having to wait longer than expected just for simple things like.. checking of orders/bread baskets/refilling of water. It got annoying but still tolerable (thank goodness food was served quickly).Overall, 3/5 experience.Bittersweet experience
4
Enjoyed our evening ... the burrata and the portobello mushroom !!! Sheer delight ! Easy drinking wine and good service ... was too full to order the lamb chops ! Opted for a risotto .... very very good ! Sure to revisit !
5
Love this place, my family comes regularly! I want the truffled pizza (Bizmark, I think?) on my deathbed! YUM
4
Food was absolutely good but service can be improved. Service staff was not attentive enough to refil the wine glasses and some carried a frown on the face constantly.
4
Friendly service. Antipasto with burrata was great. Pasta was average. But great atmosphere. Will be back to try the pizzas soon
4
This is a very quaint restaurant in a quiet location. The food is of very high quality and the serving portions are generous. The service was good and I enjoyed my dinner there. I would definitely return!
1
If you're hungry, you may want to have something at home before ordering take away. Ridiculous take away serving sizes - for $16! Seriously guys ? It's pasta ! Fill the damn tub !
4
My friends and I had a fantastic time at your restaurant - your pastas and pizzas were superb! Your wait staff were very attentive too - topping up our waters/drinks with little prompting. Looking forward to a an encore visit!

I dine quite often at the Greenwood/Hillcrest restaurants. But I’ve never eaten at La Braceria as they are on Greendale which is like the back – and thought of as back lane - of Greenwood and more often associated with the pet shop next door. It doesn’t help too when the ones outside on Greenwood have loud signboards.I was very pleasantly surprised first with how substantial – and crowded - the restaurant is with ample seating both in- and outdoors. The restaurant is very nicely decorated with simple textured white plaster walls with horizontal elongated mirrors serving as window portals. The serving staff is as charming as the pleasant ambience which La Braceria promised. The menu is a large offering of salads, antipasti, pasta, pizzas, various seafood and meats including a 1-2 kg tomahawk wagyu! We were all hungry for pasta and ordered their burrata ravioli with fresh cherry tomato sauce and chef’s specials fettucine with black truffle and linguine with sea urchin. We started with their Antipasto Braceria which is a nice blob of burrata, surrounded by grilled vegetables and cold cuts, meant for two or three to share. The burrata was a very smooth mozzarella and combined beautifully with the grilled vegetables. The pastas certainly rate as one of the best in town: five large discs of ravioli with more of the burrata smothered with thick (must be lots of fresh cherry) tomato gravy, whilst the fettucine (homemade of course) is decadent with the black truffles. Sea urchin is subtle in taste but the linguine was optimally glaced with uni flavour and highly enjoyable.We didn’t have room for desserts but the Braceria cheese cake did shout out to us amid the tiramisu, pannacotta, profiterole and gelato.The bill for our dinner was quite reasonable. We will try the seafood or meat main courses the next time. Bravo La Braceria

This place is off Main Street but nice location was recommended to our daughter. Well it didn't disappoint nice Italian meals and deserts serve was excellent.Although we were just visiting Singapore our daughter and her husband who live here will be going back that I am sure of
5
A quiet restaurant away from the hustle and bustle of the city. This is one of our favourite Italian restaurants and we have been patronising this restaurant once or twice a month for several years already. Our usual orders are the half burrata with parma ham and cherry tomatoes, seafood pasta and seafood pizza. The staff are friendly and attentive. We visit here so often to the point that the waiter can even remember our exact order.It Is quite inconvenient to dine there if you do not have your own transportation. Parking is also quite a problem there but it is great that they have their own valet parking
5
Impressive food. This place is known for its pizzas but we were really impressed by the burrata cheese. Weather was perfect for an al fresco expereince
5
Had my mother's birthday celebration there and the food and service were great. Would definitely go there again.
5
Flavorful and artful dining covering a range of modern Italian favorites including fresh salad, porcini risotto, eggplant parmesan, and seafood vongole with pasta. Great place for a couples night out.
5
Good food thank you for the food and ambience. Very enjoyable for the family and friends appreciate the
4
The good was on par with expectations. Not the best mains i've had but above average. The tiramisu was very good though! The outdoor seating area was casual but cosy.
5
Good food. The half boston lobster with linguine in bisque was absolutely delicious. Their cheese cake, which they termed as must try, is definitely a must try. The panna cotta was delicious as well.
4
The food is good. The ambiance is nice. The price is reasonable. The staff are polite except one of them who look like the manager. He doesn't smile at all and when we asked him questions, he just gave us a quick answer. My family and I went there to celebrate my husband's birthday. I put that in the 'Special request' section when I made the online booking. Unfortunately the restaurant didn't offer anything special. It would be nice if the restaurant would offer a simple dessert
3
Overall food is average at best, luckily the olive oil , balsamic and cheeses are pretty good. the salt on the grilled fish tastes great too. Improvement is needed on the pasta cooking skills. There is some residue in my dining partner's port and she does not like its taste. My Pinot Grigio is alright though
3
The environment is good for wine & dine & the service is super, however, the food arrangement serving is italian style which I will put it does not suited the Chinese ethnic. The tasty food should came in to test the taste buds & subsequently for filling type of those that have not enough. The grilled chicken does not came with aromatic flavour, The best is the Branzino medium cooked where you have the real taste of beef. I would still recommend to go for the 2nd time where we ill know the goodness. Watch out on the ordering, the staff does not abled to estimate the amount & in fact we have over ordered.
4
Nice little friendly Italian restaurant, very decent food and good service. The burrata starter was a standout as was the seabass main course. Not too expensive by SGP standards and also have a BYOB policy: first 2 bottles are corkage free, thereafter $25 each. Not bad
4
Enjoyed the food, atmosphere and the little greeb garden in a hidden alley. They have some nice Italian products, such as the cheeses, tomatoes and meet which are really fresh.
5
La Braceria was and still is on my top 3 list of Italian restaurants in Singapore.
The food never disappoint in La Braceria.
3
Was very excited to try out the food, but was dissappointed afterward. Food was mediocre ,nothing to shout home about , but the service is fantastic. They give advise if you over ordered. Price is also very reasonable.
5
If you are looking for a special lunch/dinner in a family friendly environment with a great host. This is the place. It looks like a piece of Italy. Andriano is a great host and the seafood pasta is AMAZING! Wrapped in the foil, cartoccio style. The taste is truly special.The focaccia "Genovese" is also great, freshly made by Adriano. This is the only place that has genovese focaccia in Singapore. Gnammy! I will certainly go back!
5
Came here for my fiance's birthday who loves pizza and we were not dissapointed ! Staff also waived off corkage fees as we had brought some bubbles to celebrate and they were very cooperative to help me prepare for a surprise too. It's faraway if you live close to the CBD but the calm terrace and good food makes it worth the trip. Thanks !

Tuck away is an unassuming restaurant with clean and understated deco. Busy in the night we were there hence it was a bit of a frenzy. Ordered some starters and appetizers to share and both the Ceasar Salad and Portobello Mushroom was pleasantly nice. But when we were deciding which main to order, we ended up with a Carnivore pizza, seafood spaghetti and the special's skipper lobster linguini? It ended up that both pasta were cream base which was a downer as we were hoping to try different sauces.We ask the waiter to suggest the 2nd pasta dish which he could have offer a tomato/pesto/olio style option... The pizza was very salty for us. Generous in portion but SALTY! We ended the meal with 2 desserts - Pana Cotta and Tiramisu. Both dessert were a good serving size to share and it tasted good. Not memorable.....Verdict, not the best place to have a quiet meal as it was crowded and noisy..Food are good for most of our order.. Are there better restaurants out there??? Most definitely!
4
I had a great time. I ordered the half lobster linguine which was the star of the vending. The lobster is fresh and juicy. The linguine was perfect and the sauce was just sufficient to make it tasty yet not too much to make you sick of it. However, when the steak my mother ordered came, it was disappointing. We ordered a medium, and the waiter said it wouldn't be too reddish. However what came was clearly medium rare
4
In looking for Italian food to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary, my wife and I decided to try out La Braceria. First impressions: relaxing decor, white sheets and good music.Food: - Starter: Parmigiana Di Melanzane - served piping hot and straight from the oven. Cheeses were still bubbling and a good balance of flavor.- Main: Fettucine Norcina - good flavor from the sausage and the creaminess of the sauce was excellent.- Main: Fresh Half Boston Lobster with Linguine in Bisque Sauce - great bisque sauce which coats the linguine; you could taste the freshness of the lobster served in the half-shell. - Dessert: Pannacotta - smooth pudding and good strawberry sauce; delicious- Dessert: Profiteroles - pastry was a little moist, but otherwise a good dishService: attentive and timely - not intrusive (as it sometimes can be at other establishments); a good thing for having a conversation with your dinner partner.Overall, a pleasurable experience and we will be happy to pay a visit again.
4
Great Italian food in a cosy cafe with great service. We had a selection of appetisers to share - portobello mushrooms, fresh oysters, burrata cheese and Parma ham, fried calamari and the pizza for meat lovers. All recommended!The pastas were al dente in fairly generous portions. I had the one with autumn white truffles, sliced and topped the creamy linguine. Desserts were super - profiteroles, cheesecake and lava cake (must not be missed!
4
We've been to the restaurants fronting Greenwood Ave many times over the years, but didn't realise there was a nice Italian one hidden at the back, on Greendale ave. So we were pleasantly surprised to find that la Braceria could do a saturday birthday lunch for my son at short notice. The food is very good (we enjoyed the pizzas and calamari nero linguine most), the service is attentive and friendly, and prices are reasonable
4
Cozy, private, homey. I like coming here with my family because the food is very good, the ambience is nice and cozy and the price is very reasonable.
A must try: Cartoccio pasta and Italian Cheese Cake! Super Yummy!
5
Would recommend if you are looking for authentic Italian food that is sometimes difficult to find in Singapore.
4
This has become one of our family favourite dining spot. The food is excellent, and service is prompt and friendly. The must try's include Burrata, calamari, for starters. Squid Ink pasta, crab meat pasta and tenderloin for mains. Leave room for home-made cheese cake for dessert. However, parking (if you drive) can be a problem. And do make reservations esp on weekend
5
This is the second time that I've been at La braceria and the service and the food has always been at the top. In particular chef Giovanni has cooked for me special dishes as sciatt and pizzoccheri typical food of my valley! I highly recommend this place if you want to have the feeling to enjoy real awesome Italian food in Singapore at a reasonable price!!!
5
Tucked away behind a row of restaurants in a neighborhood, La Braceria serves excellent Italian food that's great value for money. The quality is high and portion size is quite big too. The service is prompt and friendly. The lava cake is really very good. Do make reservations if you're going on a weekend. I plan to visit again to try out more items on their menu that offers quite a wide choice.
4
My first time here, I ordered a Al Braceria pizza - sausages and mushroom ($25) is ok, spaghetti carbonara ($19) - dry sauce and a Half Burata cheese with Parma ham ($25) - really good. Restaurant is nicely furnish. Location is off bukit timah road at greenwood Ave.
4
This restaurant is out of the way, but we'll worth the effort to get there. Only the freshest ingredients are used in dishes that are traditional. Buratta cheese is awesome and probably the best I have had in singapore, seafood pasta dishes are very good with a sweet flavour of the meat combining with perfectly al Dante pasta, pizza is authentic ( very close to napolitana style). So think slightly chewy crispy crust with thick fragrant tomato sauce & loads of yummy stretchy buffalo mozzarella cheese rather than the paper thin bland pizza's. Other highlights are the wagyu pasta, ravioli in cheese sauce, Maine lobster pasta, and of course they also have truffles which can be sprinkled on the buratta or on pasta. Another dish is the home made tagliatelle with truffles in light cream sauce which is also good. Service is discreet, desert is good though the tiramisu is great. One of the best value places in singapore, I visit each time I am in Singapore.Disclaimer: Have visited Italy 5 times & love cheese
5
The surrounding 3 blocks have 3-4 Italian restaurants. We have tried all of them save one (the expensive one) and this is by far the best - hands down. Their pizza is the best, their pasta is the best, their desserts are the best...I'd wager their wines are the best, though I am no oenophile. The decor is nothing to write home about. It's nice but I think the owners spend their $$ and their time worrying more about what they put on your plate. La Braceria is around the corner from the long bit on Greenwood with all the other restaurants in a row. It's a testament to its quality that it's even still around. It took us 2 full years to even try it, so familiar were we with the other options that seem more easily accessible. I really do think more is homemade at this place. You can see all the tiramisu and cheesecake individually portioned and cellpohaned in a display case at the back. Just like you would do at home - except for the display case. The specials change regularly depending on whats available. Our kids will eat almost any pizza but even they can recognize the superior crust and cheese. Even the sauce is better! It's their new favorite. We all love their tiramisu - it's clearly an indulgent dessert but not too sweet.This is our new favorite in the neighborhood. Go early (before 7) and they can usually fit you in right away for dinner even without a reservation
4
Tasty Italian dining in comfortable cozy atmosphere ... with both indoor (air-conditioned) and outdoor dining. Dishes were all nicely prepared from appetizers to entrees and to the desserts. Wine selection also very good. But it was the consistent polite service by each the service staff which was the most impressive. We'll be back. Tip: If you order the profiteroles for dessert, note that it really is vanilla cream (vs. vanilla ice cream) on the inside
4
Been around a while, small cosy restaurant near where we lived. Haven't been for several years because hard to get a table inside for Sunday dinner. Got a table today but decided to sit outside as weather was nice. Great choice of appetisers, mussels were good value, octopus cappachio tender and portobello salad excellent though not much portobello. Steaks look excellent on the menu but decided to have pastas as it was a carb evening. Linguine w lobster was a delight, garlicky and good value. Spaghetti fruit to de mare was excellent. Good service and just a nice friendly cosy atmosphere, home cooking trattoria style, will be back soon

A well dressed Italian on the corner (even though it does not rest on a corner).
Nice atmosphere with attentive service/staff and good food.

Good food and service! Perfect! I was here for my Valentine's Day dinner and it was the most perfect place for a date :)

This is our second visit to La Braceria. The food was great and reasonably priced. We reached the restaurant on a Friday at 730pm and it was empty. However, by 8pm, it was packed and service become a bit slow. Suggest the restaurant to add more vegetarian items to the menu. Currently the choices are very limited
5
I can’t speak highly enough of the quality of food, service, attitude, feeling of the place and food..oh and then there’s the food. Did I mention that. Superb value for money. We always compare to other restaurants. There are other Italian restaurants, more upmarket which are excellent too. There are others..newcomers run by famous chefs, who should know better. This is the real deal
4
Nice and quiet during the day, so perfect for a quiet get together. The wine list is not extensive but it is very well selected. They also offer a BYO option where for every bottle you buy, there's no corkage on one of your own. The antipasto plate is a must.
4
The food at La Braceria is always at high standards over the years. I especially enjoyed the Chef's special this time - lobster linguine. The lobster was cooked perfectly and the bisque was infused into the pasta. Even my children reached over and helped themselves to my main course. I highly recommend La Braceria to anyone who enjoys good Italian food
1
We live in the neighbourhood and are (were!!) regulars here. The food has always been good and the ambience too. Today will be our last visit here thanks to a stubborn, non understanding and unnecessarily argumentative manager. The manager only needed to apologise for a wrongly prepared order but instead went on and on, defending himself and his 'professional chef ' who only does orders only a certain way. The closest he came was to say 'everyone makes mistakes'Wow!
4
We follow the waiters lead here and never go wrong, feel safe asking 'what's good tonight'. If that's not your gig then the menu will have what you like. The quality of produce and preparation is excellent.
5
Great experience..must try..food was awesome..authentic italian cuisine..also the restaurant have very good ambience
4
This is our family's weekend haunt, and we haven't gotten sick of this place since we discovered it two years ago. The restaurant is never too crowded and we love the food, which is fresh and well-sourced (with many ingredients coming from a wholesale supplier in Italy)I'd recommend the:spaghetti vongole (cooked al dente)baked seafood pastaand the tiramisu and chocolate lava cake (heart emojis
5
We just love it! The best Italian ever! The Food, the Ambiente, the Service is still just amazing! Now you might think we got paid for this..? No. We mean it. Try the Parma-Ham Pizza and you will be addicted ! But please leave your car at home, because the Police is around in this local area every Night and you will get a Ticket very easy. Also it"s better, because you can enjoy the fantastic Wine !

Had a lovely anniversary dinner at this restaurant. Although we were in office attire, several casually dressed patrons were obviously regulars living in the neighbourhood. They ordered their usual dishes, were welcomed like friends, ate and left without lingering. There is an ample outdoor area for al fresco dining. Popular with families and groups of friends, there were also large table reservations although no private room. Highly recommend the excellent antipasto sharing platter of assorted hams, burrata cheese and grilled veggies. The crab fettuccini was tasty but the pasta a bit overdone. The spaghetti vongole was so-so. Unfortunately we were too stuffed to appreciate any desserts although there was a good selection at reasonable prices. Will definitely return soon. Fortunately the restaurant was not full because the indoor tables were placed rather close to each other
5
had an excellent dinner here with superb italian food and wine. the location is lovely and the sitting was al fresco. this being a residential area, was quite and lots of foliage. also tried grappa for the first time and found it ok. the service was excellent and the Italian guy serving us was knowledgeable about the wines
3
i've eaten here close to a dozen times.la braceria is a very decent place to go for italian food in singapore. the pasta is nice; the pizza is nice; the antipasti is nice. it is nice.it is also priced very decently, although prices appear (my observation -- may be inaccurate) to have crept up a little.but i would eat there weekly.the mostly foreign staff (italian) is friendly and engaging, which helps. i have only nice things to say about this restaurant
4
Great steak and pleasantly quiet atmosphere away from the busy marina bay and downtown. The staff is for once -exception in Singapore !- really attentive and courteous.However a bit expensive in my view. Not really sure why it's so expensive to go for an ordinary meal in Singapore .....
3
Went around the corner to visit the local Italian since it had been a while. This is one of the favourite Italian restaurants in a neighbourhood which has a lot Italian restaurants. However, this night they where not up to their normal standard... The food was a little "flat" and not as tasty as normal and the staff was not as attentive as normal. It's still a good neighbourhood restaurant, but if they continue like this I doubt many would want to travel to dine here.. Hope that they can get back in their strive.
5
We've eaten here with our 3 children and friends on many occasions. The food is always very good (we often have the specials), the service is attentive and the value better than we've experienced for Italian elsewhere in Singapore. While there's not a kids menu, they will create kids' options or half orders upon request
3
The restaurnt has good ambience, cosy, fantastic service but food quality can be improved for its price.
5
Have come to this place for celebrations for the past 5 years. Always impressed by the good food and affordable pricing. Portions are generous as well.
5
Great experience in this small Italian Restaurant, top food, top service, and very warm and charming environment.
It was just great evening.
3
I came here with my husband and sister for a Sun night dinner. Place is nice and casual, with friendly waiters. We had the white asparagus with fried egg (good), burrata with truffle oil (good) and clams in white wine (excellent, fresh and plump). We all had pasta main courses and I thought my angel hair with Italian chili and prawns was very good, while my sisters and husband's pasta was ok. Bill came up to around $300 with wine, which I think is reasonable by Singapore standards. I would come back again.
5
We have now been twice with our daughter who is a regular at this little hidden away gem.Being located at the back of the main restaurant area at Greenwood Ave you do not walk past it and can be easily missed. The external view is not overly enticing, but an inside is very nicely set up and the menu/food/price were all quite acceptable. This place will become a regular must visit when we are up there again in the future. Servings (seafood pasta) are not overly large (common in Sing) but overall by the end of the night we had a nice fill

La Braceria Pizza & Grill is an authentic Italian cuisine from the Southern part of Italy ranging from gourmet pastas to wood-fire pizzas. La Braceria is situated in the Bukit Timah area (Greendale Avenue). Family-owned style restaurant Owned by Chef Fabio Iannone and managed by his younger brother Adriano Iannone. The restaurant is child-friendly with baby chairs and kids cutlery. The wait staff are friendly and attentive. Being Italian Eating out in Singapore this has to be one of my favorite Italian restaurants, it has the best home-style Italian food around. Ravioli was to die for with an excellent light mushroom and truffle filling, balanced with just the right amount of white sauce, in marginally al dente pasta just cooked right. Desserts were very well executed lava cake had a very rich chocolate taste, soft and gooey in the middle and exquisitely cooked. Home-made Ice creams were also excellent , their mascarpone cheese cake is to die forPizzas are also the best (outside of Italy), perfectly cooked and with beautifully balanced flavors, crust baked to perfection. , prices was reasonable with a good wine selection. Itâ€™s truly a joy to eat. Definitely a must-try
5
We eat out a lot (1-2 times per week in expensive restaurants $100+ per head) and particularly like Italian, French Thai and Japanese cuisine. Braceria was recommended to us by an Italian friend in Singapore so we went along for Sunday lunch. In five years of regularly eating out in Singapore this si the best home-style Italian food we have had.Pizza's were the best that we have had outside of Italy, perfectly cooked and with beautifully balanced flavours, crust baked to perfection. House special ravioli was to die for with an excellent light mushroom and truffle filling, balanced with just the right amount of white sauce, in fractionally al dente pasta (just as it should be). Desserts were very well executed - lava cake had a very rich chocolate (as opposed to cocoa) taste, soft and gooey in the middle and beautifully cooked. Ice creams (home made I think) were also excellent - vanilla was creamy with a strong vanilla flavour, whilst the pistachio had a strong nutty taste, pistachio pieces and a lovely creamy base. Home-style decor, but tastefully done, makes it feel a bit more upmarket than many of the other brasserie style Italian restaurants in Singapore. Service was very good with all dishes served up fresh, and promptly, despite it being busy - clearly the kitchen is used to handling multiple orders in a timely manner.Overall the best home-style Italian dining experience in Singapore
2
The food is usually good and we have been regularly visiting this restaurant for the last 2 years for lunch and dinner. Unfortunately we experienced appalling customer handling skills by the manager who would choose to 'make his point' and argue (to the embarrasment of all other diners) over extra $15 dollars unfairly charged to us (a quick calculation tells me we have spent approximately $7K at this restaurant, not counting recommendations to friends) , rather than retain his regular customer. While we were not expecting much in terms of customer service from the staff, as on several occasions we had noticed that it was average, but today's experience, ensured that our dinner tonight will be our last at La Braceria and just like we shared with our friends about the good food for the last two years, we will be sharing about our latest disappointment with them as well. However, I get the feeling we are more sad about this than the La Braceria management
4
We are not really regular customer but we love to go every other weeks for a dinner there. the indoor decoration is just ok but the terrace is nice. The food is really good, truffle here means truffle Fish, meat pasta.. whatever you like is done perfectly..The service is very good too, all of them will always find some time for some talk... italian way.The wine list can be improved but you will find reasonably good italian wine for an affordable pric
3
First our reservation did not go through, then we waited outside for a table for 15 min since the waiter was serving other tables. We were not told that we had to wait, they plainly ignored us. Even after being seated the service was average. Slow response and certain orders were forgotten. The highlight was the ravioli that was really nic
4
Good Italian dishes. One of the best Ink squid pasta ive tasted! If only i can cook this in Norway! Desserts were good too. I particularly liked their grappa, and wine collections
4
i went whit one italian group for dinner and i founded fantastic place !!i eated carpaccio fish...excellent and tagliolini whit clams and bottarga ..superb!!!!fantastic food and very cheap price!!i will come
4
It seems to be truffle season as every dish on the $70 set menu consisted of big paper thin slivers of truffle. From the fragrant carpaccio, to the al dente linguine carbonara and italian pork belly downed with a glass of chianti. My host had no trouble for a workout session at 7am next morning. I settled for the Branzino Al Sale (seabass baked in salt) - only applause here - tenderly and simply cooked and very tasty with small salad at the side. For this dish, there is choice of having to crack through the salt to the fish yourself or let the kitchen work it for you. The latter proved the wiser choice! Apart from good food, ambience is lively with outdoor seating and service, attentive. Food is on the pricey side
4
La Braceria is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Singapore. Tucked away in a back alley behind the stretch of restaurants along Greenwood Ave in Bukit Timah, La Braceria is an unpretentious neighborhood eatery with consistently good food and service.The menu offers a wide selection of starters, mains, pasta dishes and pizzas - all very good with generous portion sizes. There's also a nice outdoor patio, perfect for al fresco dining on a cool evening. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone craving for good Italian food in low key atmosphere
5
Try it, words are useless.Frankly!Pasta is just perfect, regardless which one you choose.Atmosphere is quiet and peaceful, the perfect place to enjoy food and being with family/friends, remotely, without traffic, noise, excessive AirCon.If you're looking for the trendy place of S'pore, go elsewhere. If you enjoy food, company and peacefuness, this is the very spot. . . . . . . . . 
5
I hate restaurants that have a lot of hype and require weeks to book ahead or hours of waiting. So Le Braceria is one of my favorite go to places in Singapore. It is unassuming but has consistently great food and service. There's a nice outdoor porch that is ideal for a cool evening meal. I love their burrata,cold cuts, egg plant parm and pizzas. My favorite dish - Truffle Tagliatelle - has sadly been removed from the menu but sometimes I can get them to make it for me. Finally, the restaurant has one of my favorite Tiramisu! A hidden gem in Bukit Timah
4
We had a bit of an iffy start to our meal at La Braceria with much confusion over our reservation and where we could sit but I would have to say that the staff and food turned things around very quickly afterwards.We had a family Sunday lunch there, simple enough stuff, antipasto and some pizzas and pasta but it was all done very very well.After our bad start, the service was attentive without being overbearing, the food arrived promptly without feeling rushed and the place is very family friendly. The wine list is adequate and not badly priced. We will definitely be back
5
Had the best ravioli I've ever had at this small tucked away restaurant near Greenwood Ave. We drove past it and missed it and had to walk back to find it. But a great find for special occasions or a casual dinner. Limited vegetarian options, but quality wins over quantity.Inside seating gets filled up fast, so call ahead. Also, drivers will appreciate the ample parking space around this place
5
Have not been to Braceria for awhile. Went there with a group of friends last week. They recommended us the Cross Wagyu T Bone 1kg. The meat was done in perfection. It was juicy and tender. We also tried the White truffle pasta which was heaven... I will be going back for the T Bone soon. Hope they will maintain the pricing : )
4
Group of 9. We had a great time here. The food was very good. We liked the burrata cheese and assorted cold cuts, squid ink pasta, white truffle pasta, vongole, steak Florentine. For dessert, I liked the Tiramisu and profiterole. The cheese cake was so so
5
Simple but tasty Italian foods. Almost home cooking. Pasta dishes were done the way we prefer el dente. The Margerita Pizza was not perfectly stretchy, cheesy, bready Napoli type but acceptable. All in all a good Italian dine out.

http://draftsfromcoffeetable.blogspot.sg/2013/06/la-braceria.htmlThe above records my full dining experience here.Imagine our surprise when we found out that this restaurant is tucked in a rather “inaccessible” part of Bukit Timah, right smack in the middle of the island nation, instead of a spot which can be easily reached by taking public transports. I guess that the restaurant expected its guests to be driving instead of arriving on foot like what we did. We tried our best to hide our surprise when the meals arrived and I think we managed that rather well. A soft bread with a fluffy center and slightly crunchy crust brought up our mood and get our gastronomic juice flowing.One of the more memorable was Risotto con Porcini e Profumo di tartufo - it may have a creamy texture, but it holds itself together much like a paste when spaded up in a spoon. For the health conscious, this may not be a recommended choice with such high amount of butter within. With such aroma though, the dish will be irresistible as each scoop into the mouth help push the next in
4
We came twice here so far and always enjoyed the Pizzas. Today we tried the Lasagne, my son loved it. Nice seating inside (all Asian) and outside (the expats of course) which shade and a bit of green. Service was friendly and fast. Price acceptable. We will come again
4
My wife and I went with to La Braceria with another couple for a "double date" last night (a Friday evening). Here's a quick overview:Location - Tucked away in the Greenwood area... definitely a place you wouldn't just "happen upon". But that's okay, because it makes it feel a bit private, secluded even. Valet parking was a nice touch.Ambiance - Just nice. There is a patio out front for those desiring to eat al fresco, but we chose to eat indoors. It's not an especially large restaurant, but we never felt cramped or crowded - even though the place did fill up once 7:30 PM rolled around. Noise inside the restaurant was moderate (not a "hush-hush" quiet kind of place, but not frantic and crazy, either).Food - We all greatly enjoyed our food. I had my first taste of -- and fell in love with -- burrata, which was part of the exceptional antipasto platter. (If you've never heard of "burrata", check here: http://www.thekitchn.com/the-transformative-power-of-bu-141082). I also tried the baked eggplant appetizer, which was delightful. For the main entree, there was a wide variety of Italian dishes to choose from. I really thought my main course (baked lasagna, "homemade mamma's recipe") was fantastic, and the other three in our party thoroughly enjoyed their seafood spaghetti (served wrapped in paper - a nice, rustic touch), salted sea bass (also a lovely presentation), and linguine with Wagyu beef. Desserts were very good; just take note, though, that their tiramisu is not a traditional "cake" presentation... it's served in a tall glass, but sufficiently sized for two to share.Service - Not atypical to Singapore, we had to flag down a server on several occasions ("We're ready to place our order", "Could we get some more water", "Could we get some more water", etc.)... but all of the employees were friendly and helpful, especially the young man (who I'm guessing is the manager).Complaints? I only have one, really... The seats were a bit uncomfortable; I had to get and walk around once just to give my tailbone a break.Overall, we all had a wonderful time at La Braceria. The location and ambiance were nice, but the food was the standout star -- it was really a wonderful dining experience, and I would definitely enjoy visiting again. (Unfortunately, we're moving away from Singapore in just a few weeks, so I may not get another chance!)P.S. It looks like I wasn't the only one who enjoyed their burrata... http://travel.cnn.com/singapore/eat/4-authentic-italian-restaurants-singapore-worth-tracking-down-35727

If we wanted Italian in the Greenwood area, we would normally dine at Peperoni. Last evening we thought we'd be adventurous and try out La Braceria round the back at Greendale, because some friends had recommended them. We went at about 8pm on a Friday evening and was surprised we managed to get a table without reservations. The place however filled up very quickly and by the time we left it was overflowing. Interesting demographics/behaviour though - all the Cninese indoors, the Caucasian expats outside!Nice casual dining with great ambience. Service was prompt and friendly. The bill took a bit long to come, but this was understandable given the business of the moment.The food however, was really disappointing. I had expected better. The pasta (fettucine with wagyu/porcine) was rather chewy rather than al dente, and somewhat tasteless. The pizza I had was equally tasteless, flavourless. The thin-crust was very crispy, but the base unfortunately turned very leathery.All in all a reasonable night out, but we weren't very encouraged to return. I think there are better pasta joints in the vicinity
4
We had dinner there on a Saturday night. They have a valet service which is very handy as parking can be a bit hard to find. Service is not their strong point, it is fairly efficient but not friendly.The beef carpaccio was the best of all the starters we ordered. Our vongole was really tasty but very sandy so we had to send it back and they cancelled our order for that. The burrata cheese platter was beautiful with cold cuts and vegetables.Everyone agreed the fettuccine with truffles was really good, the cream sauce was just divine. The same can't be said of the veal & mushroom pasta, the sauce was rather bland and the veal were little chopped up bits, if you could find them! The pizza is good, really nice thin crust and the gnocchi was nicely done too. The risotto marinara was alright.We gave the thumbs up to the panna cotta and the tiramisu for dessert. I'd definitely go back there again soon
4
We went for a mid week dinner. Welcome by the staff was warm. I immediately liked the feel of the place as I walked in . Lighting was just right..AC wasn't too cold.. music at the right volume. We had the fried smoke mozzarella with ham for starters which was a pleasant start... I particularly wanted to go for traditional Italian food choices so Risotto and Pasta were ordered. Good sized dishes. I cant complain about the risotto ...seafood pasta was a little too al dente for me ...but by no means spoiled the dish. Seafood was fresh and cooked well. The deserts were pleasing too. Not the largest choice of wines. The kitchen staff were visibly interactive with the clientele All in all a place I would recommend and return to. Reasonable value for money for Singapor
2
We made reservations for dinner and first appearances are good - looks like a family run restaurant with a real pizza oven in the corner and bottles of Italian wines on display for drinking on site as well as buying to take home at 15-20% discount. We were sat a table and we had ordered our wine with a man who I assume is the owner/manager whilst we continued to browse the menu for our food choices. There was another table already sat down with children towards the back of the room. It turns out they wanted to be seated at a bigger table and that would involve moving me and my friend. In this situation, the owner/manager only needed to ask us nicely, perhaps offer us an aperitivo for our trouble. But instead he came over with our wine and told us he would open it but not serve it until we moved table. We informed him this was new to us but that we would sit where we were until our new table was ready. He said that was not possible and he wanted us to move right now and stand by the door so his staff could set this table first, the complaining family could be sat down and then we would be given our table after. We stood at the door for 15 minutes, no one even offered us ice water and he even asked us to wait outside at one point to keep the door area clear which I refused to do. So we were finally sat down, I was in a pretty bad mood and ready to hate the place. However the pasta was really delicious, cooked perfectly al dente and not drowned in salt or sauce. An excellent chef but sadly let down by the man who runs front-of-house. The restaurant scene in Singapore is pretty rich and competitive - service is pretty important to keep regulars coming back
4
Went with the wife. We had a shared starter and a pasta dish each, no alcohol.The taste was excellent, and despite the small order, we were nicely filled up thereafter.Maybe the only downside is that this came to a bill of close on S$80, so it is not exactly the place for a quick, nice meal but the food quality made it worth it, and I am sure we will come back
4
We discovered La Braceria a few years ago, when we were taking our dog to the vet (the restaurant is right next door) and have been regular visitors since then. Our favourite dishes are the pizza and the linguini with truffle oil, the smell of which always makes me want to order it as soon as I have sat down! We are equally fond of the sister restaurant, Limoncello on Robertson Quay. If you want great pizza in Singapore, this is the place
3
I used to enjoy the fish starter (raw fish with capers) but this time it smelt really fishy. The pizzas were pretty average too. I feel that standards have fallen since my earlier review.
4
La Braceria combines quality of the food with friendness of the owners and relatively fair price.
Pizza is great and pastas well prepared, Risotto ai Porcini deserves a mention.
Need to book during weekends
4
Cosy ambience with good Italian food and wine selection.
4
friendly owners and best pizza ever.
5
We enjoy Italian food and particularly enjoyed this restaurant. The food is simple but the chef is obviously very good. Pasta with broccoli and sausage was perfect - al dente and tasty without being overly elaborate, the mozzarella pizza had a perfect tomato base, and the beef and fish carpaccio starters were, again, well seasoned, fresh and tasty. The wine cellar too was good, and not overpriced by Singapore standards. This restaurant is casual and relaxed and we will definitely be putting it on our list of regular places to visit

The name "La Braceria Pizza and Grill" gives you different view than what it may truely represent. You think of a pizza place, but it's more than that. The owner and head chef is from Italy. There is fantastic outdoor seating in a quaint residential neighborhood, but you can also sit indoors surrounded by family-style tables, and a cold glass display towards the kitchen reminding you of so many quaint restaurants in southern Italy. We've tried many of the entres, salads, and soups. They also cook up a wonderful fiorentina-style T-bone steak. We've visited Singapore twice in the last 8 months, and have been there 3 times during these visits. It's a perfect get-away from the more expensive restaurants. Finding the restaurant can be a challenge. It's located in the suburbs of Greenwood, at Greenwood Avenue. Even when you're on the correct road, it's hidden behind a wall of plants, effectively blocking their signage and storefront. And at night, the road that runs alongside it is totally dark, making it easy to miss. Recommend that you call when you're close by, and they'll guide you in. Even if you're coming by taxi, the drivers will get you close, but they may still have to call the place to pull up directly in front of it. BUT, don't let that discourage you. You will enjoy the food and the experience

My husband had booked a table here for dinner to surprise me on my birthday. Service from start to finish was nonchalant, the food was salty and to top it off, the birthday cake which we were expecting was not made despite having been pre-ordered in advance. Instead what was served was a mishmash of 3 slices of cake which were clearly leftover from a larger cake with no candle or care. I could not have been more horrified or insulted. We will never come back here again even though it is our local restaurant and we live within walking distance of it. The quality of food and standard of service has really fallen since it first opened and we were very upset and disappointed today. It was incredibly embarrassing as we had asked some friends to join us for dinner to celebrate and we ended up having a rather difficult conversation with the staff about why the ridiculous birthday cake was served. I wish I did not have to post a review like this but I regret we did not go to Valentinos instead

The ambience, the service, the price, the layout, the noise level, the crowd. Now the food is not just right! it is really good-it is a great place for a crowd, for co-workers, for a work day meal, or for a romantic date. I have enjoyed myself everytime I have been there-that is about 4 times in half a year. ...go for the mushroom rissotto in particular
