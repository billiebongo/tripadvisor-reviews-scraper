The food is generally good here! Really like the pancakes and the smoked salmon with Hollandaise sauce! Coffee is also very well brewed here. Will definitely come back for more!
5
Great place to dine at. Portions are big, staff are friendly. Definitely worth visiting again! Thumbs up!
5
Great cafe, atmosphere is really nice. The staff are excellent, very friendly. Coffee is really good. Been going here for years and it has always been a great experience every time
3
The atmosphere is nice but as it was crowded, it was a tad noisy. The food is average at the cost thus would go for coffee or milkshake on an off peak weekday but thats about it.
4
i had wanted to try the steak and quinoa bowl, but it was unfortunately not available. the bacon and mushroom agio olio is always a safe choice, though.
5
Excellent food and scrambled eggs! We could make our own breakfast so we selected keto friendly diet like scrambled eggs, frittata, sausage, bacon, avocado :)
5
Great for brunch with some tasty, unusual options like the pumpkin pancake with poached eggs and coconut espresso latte. Plus good standards. Granted, it was light on patrons due to New Years Morning timing, but the space in the couch room was great for kids.
4
Located on the upper floor of a shophouse along Duxton Road. It can be pretty crowded and a little hot as the air conditioning does not seem to work well. The fans helps a little . The lemon tarts nice and do expect the lemon curd is sour and refreshing . The mint mocha is nice and so is the latte. Overall, a nice experience besides the temperature at the back of the cafe.
2
As a restaurant I thought would be more conscious, the menu was missing vegetarian delights to choose from. And please, in future, do not think pasta is the solution. It isn't. Surely, any innovative chef worthy, can create vegetarian selections. Otherwise, the food that was provided was delicious.
4
Ordered the poached eggs - nice pairing with the smoked salmon and toast. pancakes stack serving was huge w 3 huge sized pancakes. Find it on the drier side and didnt help much even with the addition of maple syrup. But it was filling.Overall, food was okay, nice place for catching up with friends to
4
The all day breakfast taste great as well as the coffee. Will advise to make reservation since the place is not big.
5
Went for brunch with my friend. The pancakes were really good! Roasted almond latte was nice too! but the salted caramel milkshake was a bit too sweet!
4
Enjoyed my time there, with great food options available which aren't really found in other cafes! But the environment was rather noisy, but it's rather understandable as it was a Saturday!
4
Came here recently for a coffee after lunch nearby. Not too busy on a weekday lunchtime and getting a place to sit wasn't an issue. The coffee here is really very good, with friendly and efficient service to go with it. Worth another visit.
5
I always do "create your plate". the poached eggs, multi-grain toast, avocado/ guacamole, saffron yogurt dressing and a salad by the side. Go for the lavender earl grey ice tea and request the staff to not add sugar syrup. Can't go wrong with this brunch. No oil. This is my once a week brunch, usually one of the weekends. I haven't explored the variety
3
So we got so hyped up to have brunch here and all, but the food was average...The prices were affordable but the food served was really not worth the hype. We decided to try different items on the menu but none was up to our standards. We had the waffle which taste a bit burnt very very chewy, so if you are in for the starchy bitter waffles maybe this is your cup of tea? Maybe ours was just overcooked...The blueberry pancakes were not fluffy! It was dense and left a very dry after taste. The bacon on top was good though! One thing good about this cafe was that it has a very rustic feel and the cafe offers both sinful and healthy foodies out there. I am, however unsure if I would visit again..
4
Had a little trouble finding my way from Tanjong Pagar station so it's rather inaccessible. Professional service and they even changed the eggs upon my request. I personally love breakfast so the all-day brunch menu was perfect. A must to order the roasted almond latte and poached eggs! However, the beverages were charged even more compared to a tall-sized latte from Starbucks. Definitely pricey for a cafe menu but overall I had a pleasant dining experience (:
5
Haven't been to this cafe in years and was happy to find out that the food quality and taste maintain its standard. The place is conducive for couple date or big group gathering. Just a pity that it closes early at 6pm. Nevertheless would definitely return again and recommend friends to visit if they haven't try this cafe which is one of the pioneer cafes when cafe hopping trend first started in Singapore
3
It is a nice place to chill with friends. The ambience is good and drinks are quite nice. But snacks are on the average. Haven't tried their mains though. We ordered passionfruit lime tea, ice mint chocolate and mint chocolate ice blended. Drinks are up to expectation. Waffles were a bit burnt and hard. Improvement can be made. Don't order potato crisps. They serve STALE chips. I think they just pour out from a pack. They are definitely not freshly made. And it cost a ridiculous price of $6.
5
We loved this place!!Great, tasty, smooth coffee, Awesome chilled atmosphere in an upstairs location. Couches, chairs, stools, take your pick! Set up for some work with your laptop on the free wifi, or cone with friends for a catch up over coffee. Food was delicious with good variety.This place has everything. So glad we found it
5
The food and service there was awesome! The staffs are friendly and the food that we ordered was yummy. We did not wait too long for it!
5
Nice food, nice location, prices are ok, not overly expensive and worth the value! They have good waffles with ice cream too.
4
The ambience at Group Therapy is great. The food is nice. Had a great Saturday there with my friends.
4
Great coffee in a cosy environment, what more can one ask for. Will definitely be back in the near future.
4
The brunch items are all on poiint as I came with some friends to enjoy and we got to try a few items. Be warned though that this place can get crowded so make reservations beforehand or be prepared to wait!
3
Service was good, food served was prompt. Good location to locate the restaurant. Variety choices. Nice!
4
Very small tiny door along the street and step up from staircase. You will get into a lovely place. The pumpkin pancake and coconut espresso are nice.
5
I had the pumpkin pancake toppen with salamon, poached eggs and hollandaise with a cappuccino - HEAVENLY!
4
Spent a great time with my girlfriend at Group Therapy. We ordered the pumpkin pancake and Ben eggs. Both were well presented and we thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The AC is either not working or cold enough as we felt the place was a little warm. Staff are ever friendly and always putting on a smile.
1
rude services , tasteless food and worst day for me !!!!this is not first time happen to me, and i given second chance but to bad they just loose the opportunity!!!!guys you should not hired 'the woman' that don't deserve to work in hospitality line!!
3
Food was pretty pricey though the serving was large. Cafe was crowded and noisy so it was a good thing reservations could be made. Iced tea was mediocre...
3
Offers plentiful choices in food and drinks. Waffles and ice cream were good, especially the earl grey! I wished for slightly more fruit juice in my cup though:
4
Cosy and no frills dining. Food is great and service is prompt. Value for money. Pity that daily operating hours is only till 6pm.
4
Service was good. Food was great. Pancake stack with honeycomb was very hearty, perfect for sharing.
4
Visited this cafe on a PH and it's super packed! Would recommend making a reservation prior to your visit to ensure minimal waiting time. Love the food and ambience here, especially like their poached eggs with salmon on thick toast.
4
aromatic coffee and yummy breakfast, although i would have hoped the restaurant can have earlier opening hours
3
The food isn't bad for the price. Good for family and friends gathering. However, there's improvement for service.
4
Went to Group Therapy on a Sunday afternoon with my girlfriend. Both my girlfriend and I had the roasted almond coffee, very aromatic.
She has the pulled pork on the pita with fries. It was very yummy. definitelty will come back for more.
5
A friendly and even familiar feeling greeted us reaching the top of the stairs. There was a relaxed, unpretentious vibe, the staff were uber attentive, the decor was farmhouse-meets-urban-loft and the menu very affordable for the area.I had the Croque Madame, with crisps (which probably weren't really necessary) and a tatsoi lettuce salad with a tasty dressing. My wife customised her order - 2x poached eggs and a smoked salmon on multigrain, with an apple-and-carrot juice!Group Therapy goes to show if you do the basics really well, it all works out
5
An Upstairs coffee place with humble atmosphere and yet they're always so busy whenever I visit! They're serving the hipster kind of brunch menus; and also hipster kind of coffee. I had the coconut milk latte , a choice that I deeply regret since the taste is just too strong and in the end it ruined the whole drink. Food was amazing. I had a smoked salmon sandwich that in my personal opinion is the best sandwich I've ever had. The portion was ok but I'd rather having my food without the potato chips (they should make it optional in the menu) as they're too overwhelming altogether. but I'll definitely come back. the price was a bit expensive, but worth every single penny
5
The pumpkin pancake is soooo fluffy and taste as good as it looks. Will back for more, lots of options in the menu.
5
Coffee was great and food was good too! :) Coffee came in bright, cheery looking coloured cups. Liked that there was free wifi too.
1
Terrible service ! They don't appear to be friendly to Asian . A weekend with sour face service staff . Not an enjoyable meal at all. Food was on the average .
5
Always going back for the roasted almond latte- quite underrated I think. Food is always consistent and delicious making group therapy a great choice.
4
Bustling with people on a busy Sunday but service was pretty prompt. Enjoyed the apple pie and ice cream but the hot chocolate could do better! (they were nice to replace it after the feedback)
5
Went there on a Saturday morning for brunch and discussion with friends. Ambience and food is good, but do make reservation before hand.
5
Great for an afternoon with friends. The space was cozy and conducive for conversation. Coffee was good and the lemon tart was delicious.
2
I came here on a Sunday with my friends. Because of the lunchtime crowd, the cafe was pretty crowded. We were first approached by a rather rude waitress who demanded that we have to be seated at a table and we could be shifted at any moment if a customer with a reservation comes in. I understand that we could have made a reservation beforehand but I didn't think that it justify the rude service we got otherwise. On the redeeming side, the eggs Benedict and scrambled eggs set that we got were delicious. Although, the bagels were too hard and inedible and the aglio olio was too oily.
4
The process of getting a table was a little unnecessary frustrating; staff couldn't comprehend the fact that we wanted a table for four and our two other friends were 10 mins away. Was made to sit elsewhere to wait, even though we wanted them to order coffee at our table while we waited. Like sitting at our table 10 mins before the other two people arrived was going to make any difference but hey that's just how it is here sometimes...Onto the food...good coffee, good food. Also we also saw the waitress sneeze into her hand then handles the plates going to customers...Not great hygiene practices
5
Went here based on colleagues advice. Not too hard to find on Duxton Road but it is upstairs so only has a doorway to the street. Very cool place with great coffee - excellent latte and macchiato. Really interesting western brunch menu. Had the bagel with smoked salmon and scrambled eggs. Delicious!Highly recommended
5
Group therapy never disappoints with their simple fuss free food and laid back atmosphere. Always a pleasure for bring my friends over for brunch!
4
Food and beverages were great, and the portions was sufficient to share. However, the ambience might be a little noisy for work meetings, but perfect for family and friends.
4
We waited about 5-10 minutes between each meal being served.
Food was very tasty but just slightly overpriced for you get.
Great ambiance none the less
4
The cafe is nicely decorated and there were a few power points for people to charge their electronic devices. The coffee and desserts are quite nice but quite pricey.
4
Great that we made a reservation beforehand and was shown a table at a nice corner. The food served was prompt and everything was great!
5
Great coffee and waffles. Cafe does not charge service charge and GST as well. Nice place for couple brunch.
4
Good Food Good Place with good services at Group Therapy . We spent whole afternoon there and chilled with all the girls . Thank u .
5
One of my favorite brunch spots, of many, in Singapore! I usually share a stack of pancakes with someone​.
2
Against my better judgement went for mothers day with wife and daughter. Well meaning hippie want to be vibe. Small team easy overwhelmed. No service charge which seems appropriate. Order at counter. Pay in advance. A bit cramped. Staff and air con can't quite keep up. Having said that, food was really good. Portions were large. Mains and breakfast all day. Staff is sincere. Like I said, not for me. You might love it.
4
Love the menu at Group therapy! Would eat everything on it happily. Good selection of brunch meals with eggs, pancakes etc, various desserts like cakes and brownie. We all loved our meals. Wish they served decaffeinated coffee as I'd go there more often. Love the funky shop house vibe
5
Enjoyed breakfast here. Good music, great food, reasonable prices. Kid friendly too. Will definitely go back.
3
Nothing to rave about. The only dish was nice is Mushroom truffle soup. Don't have too much expectation for the mains. Didn't get to try the pancakes and heard they were superb.
5
Overall experience was a good one. Food and beverages was decent. Price wise was acceptable. Only place that needs some improvement is probably to get their staff to smile more.
4
Hidden on the 2nd Floor at duxton road, you find a cosy place which serves breakfast, good comfort food and drinks.
3
Came for Sunday brunch and it was a lot more crowded than when I last came on a Saturday morning. The staff asked us for our menus back twice even though we were still looking through them.
4
3 pax for $66, reasonable. Did a group discussion there, about 2 hours. good place to catch up. a bit walk from the MRT station, but it is worth it.
4
Cafe was a bit hard to find and it was pretty noisy when we went down on Saturday late morning. Food was pretty good, especially liked the pumpkin pancake and smoked salmon!
4
This has been around for ages. A feat given how so many restaurants along duxton have been axed so quickly. Enjoyed a latte and cake here. Good for a weekday but tends to get crowded on weekends
4
not too noisy, good menu choices and gst and service charge free! Its good place to relax and chill away from the town
4
We were pleased that the food came quickly after we placed the order despite the growing crowd during the peak hour. The food was generally satisfying - do not expect overly fantastic, but it is happy food for the tummy - for its decent affordable prices! My go to place for brunch when I run out of ideas to try out new places
5
Their coffee was really great, tastes nutty and flavourable. Definitely the best one in Singapore!!!
I like everythinh there, but music can be better?
But totally I love it!!!
5
I've been going to Group Therapy for the past 3 years and their quality is consistent, best eggs benedict.
5
Always come back for the almond latte - it is THAT good. (and so is their food)
consistent taste and service at reasonable prices
3
quiet cafe with nice ambience, good coffee and the waffles/pancakes looked amazing (with ice cream from their sister shop scoop therapy)
5
Perfect place for a gathering with friends; Food is delicious & interesting (with the option to create your own plate) + Service is good!
4
The food is good and it is good value for money. Nice coffee. Pleasant atmosphere. Always busy but I have never waited for too long to get a table.
5
The layout of the restaurant is nice. Gives off a very good vibe when you first entered. Service was good as the crew were busy sorting the tables for a large group of us. Overall very pleasant first experience.
2
We heard the reviews for this place were great so we went. The service was slow so much that the waitress was running around. I ordered the chocolate pancakes which were dry.. very dry. They looked impressive but there was no sign of the butterscotch sauce it was supposed to come with. It was really, really hard to eat. My boyfriends food came at a differnt time to me too. He watched me eat my pancakes while i watched him eat his waffle because i had already finished eating once he got his meal. Its expensive too. It cost us over 40 singapore dollars for an inedible breakfast. Steer clear
3
Visited Group Therapy over lunch a few days ago and it was unusually quiet. It was my second visit in a month and this time round, I have decided to try out their food items. The selection, frankly speaking, was quite disappointing with the limited selection of the usual all-day breakfast. pasta items. The visit to another cafÃ© at Neil Road last month probably set the expectations and given the limited choice, I went for the "safe" choice of beef burger. It didn't take too long for the food to be ready and again, there was some form of disappointment. The beef burger was served with potato chips and some greens. It was the exact side items that was present in the other food items that were ordered.Putting aside the presentation, the beef burger tasted alright. With the competition of cafes around the Duxton / Neil Road / Tanjong Pagar area, I hope that Group Therapy (being one of the pioneers located in that area) can beef up their food menu. The Botanist along Neil Road is a good starting point for a quick reference
4
This is a nondescript cafe on the first floor on quiet Duxton Rd. It's easy to miss the door & flight of stairs from the street. The place is a quaint, quiet cafe with easy, relaxed seating ideal for coffee, eats and work (Free wifi available). Grilled chicken salad was filling and really good
4
Need to know where this place is as upstairs through a door so not obvious , but once in very relaxed and cool.
Fantastic egg based brunches and delicious coffee.
2
Had aglio olio and rosti and 2 flat whites. Aglio olio was dry and bland, rosti was stale. Not worth the price at all. Coffee was good though
5
Love the food here and its friendly prices! Have been here about 5 times and the food always doesn't disappoint!
4
This is not my first visit to this cafe but it was my first time going with a big group of 7 pax. As usual the food was awesome, and my friends enjoyed every morsel of their orders. Will definitely visit again!
4
visited on a Sunday afternoon and the place was quite full. I like that the cafe doesn't charge gst or service charge. overall, the food is a mix of homely food like pastas and pies together with the usual cafe fare.
2
We went there for the waffles because several blogs have ranked GT highly for its waffles. It was very disappointing - waffles were overcooked and rubbery.
5
The food was great and poached eggs were well done! Very nice atmosphere - not too noisy or too quiet. Service was good too. Will definitely go there next time for weekend brunch~
5
Excellent ambience. Enjoyed the brunch alot with a great catch up with old school mates! Will definitely visit in the future.
4
It was my first visit to Group Therapy after reading a couple of fabulous reviews. I decided to bring my friend down to celebrate her belated birthday with Ice cream waffles. I was pleasantly surprised for the chic layout of the cafe which was spacious and had pretty good lighting for Instagram worthy shots! The staff was extremely friendly and showed us to our seats. We both decided to get Ice cream waffles. I got the vanilla bean with salted caramel syrup while my friend went for the dark chocolate ice cream with maple syrup. I must say, I was very impressed by the waffles. They were warm and fluffy! The ice cream was much better then expected and I would highly recommend the salted caramel syrup. This cafe is perfect for coffee with friends as well as dates! The cafe was relatively crowded on a Friday afternoon. I would recommend making reservations :) Definitely value for money! :
1
One of the staffs had a very unfriendly, angry and rude attitude processing order, cashier, serving and we were disgusted. I visited here with a group and everyone ordered a different drink. When she delivered various flavors of coffees, we could not get which one was which because she talked fast in low voice. So we asked to confirm and she responded angrily, "I told you once, right!?". From start to end, she was in a very bad mood and we did not enjoy the time there. She was the only one at the shop at the time and we were the only customers. I have visited here before and other staffs were not bad but I would not recommend this place
4
Nice, casual, no-fuss decor. Interesting foods such as chilli crab pie and fried corn fritters. Coffee is good as well, though presentation could be better.
4
good ambience, 80'style design restaurant ,service was excellent. i prefer u guys go for weekday, weekdend was full house and make reservation will be great.
4
Extensive menu with selection from basic egg ben to waffles to warm pies. All very tasty.
Coffees and drinks however are a bit lacking in taste and character despite the eye-catching names.
5
I went there for a cup of coffee with friends and was amazed by the service, coffee and food. Do go there for lazy Sunday or Saturday, you won't be sorry.
5
I was desperate for a decent cup of coffee during my recent trip to Singapore. Found Group Theraphy on Google. As soon as you step inside the cafe (2nd floor, up the stairs) I felt I was in the right place. Their coffee is fantastic. The All Day Breakfast menu is a life saver if you love your breakfast so much. A paradise for a Western style breakfast lovers.
5
Came here with a group of friends for a birthday celebration, and was really pleased with the food and the service provided. The staff were accommodating to our multiple requests to take photos and to help us with storing the cake we had brought along. Food and drinks were served very quickly, and was affordable in comparison to other cafes with exorbitant prices. We didn't get a rude shock with the bill because the prices stated on the menu are nett as well. My brioche and smoked salmon with poached eggs were served with a very generous amount of hollandaise sauce. Loved it! I'll be coming back next week! :
5
Found this place in the Duxton /Tanjong Pagar area where there are so many cafes of this type now days. I have to say this is one of the better ones although a little harder to find. single front door up the stairs. Easily missed. Food was excellent, the cheeseburger was one of the best I have tasted in a long while
3
Great ambience to have a working coffee or to sit down with that class project that you've been putting off for so long. Be careful though, the staff are not very friendly and will give you hints that they don't like you hanging around too long. This is NOT the place you would want to go to to order a coffee and spend 4 hours. There is WiFi here, but it's slow and may be that's another way they keep people from spending too long.
4
I came here with my friend back in December 2015 for brunch and we quite liked it! Because it was a weekday + quite early (11:00am), the café was pretty quiet and empty but the staff were welcoming and friendly. You have to order at the counter and are then served your order at your table, which I liked because there's no pressure to order right away. We both had the brioche toast, which was delicious. A good, buttery bread! And we each had a 'typical' brunch dish; mine was with smoked salmon, poached eggs, avocado, hollandaise sauce and a side salad. It was a yummy meal but I'd have to say, nothing spectacular. The coffee was decent too, as I ordered a soy cappuccino. I'd come back to try some of their other brunch dishes, particularly their desserts/sweet stuff, which looked quite appetising
3
The ambient is cosy. No crowd on a Saturday morning. The food portion was alright. Ordered eggs and waffle. Peanut butter was too dry for the waffle. A relax place on a Saturday morning. Don't expect any service. The staff are not friendly and they seem moody. Staff are too focus on their duties and lack of the service touch .
4
laidback, cozy, good food. entrance is on 2nd floor of a shophouse. suitable for group of friends or families, or just by yourself. food is valid, both taste and quantity wise. decent coffee.
4
Went for a post lunch coffee and cake. Cool temperature, comfy relaxed seating and tasty coffee (great lattes). WiFi fast too. And staff did not rush us in anyway.
Definitely return for coffee if in area.
4
Group Therapy serves brunch served in an antique plate bringing back old school times. The portion was a tad too big and i had difficulty finishing the plate of sandwich. Be prepared to wait and also you may have to share tables with strangers due to the overflowing of customers. Overall, the food was great but the surrounding could be a little noisy as everyone is trying to raise their voice so as they could be heard by their peers.
5
Went for brunch and had an amazing waffle with fresh fruit, maple syrup and vanilla ice cream. Service spot on and great atmosphere. Seemed to be a very popular place and I can understand why. If you are looking for somewhere away from the crowds this is the place to go...
4
Second time here and still as good as the first! Their pancakes are to die for - better come early or they'll be sold out after 2pm! Service is more prompt this time, we only waited for 10 minutes to get seated. Love staffs, lovely food and great coffee! Thumbs up
4
Visited Group Therapy on Duxton Road and it was by far the best soya latte I have had in Singapore so far - decent size, excellent foam. The brunch options were limited for vegetarians (all had either ham or salmon with the exception of the banana pancakes). However, you were able to "build your own plate" which was a great, flexible way of creating your own brunch. I had toast, eggs, avocado and mushrooms. Considering Singapore is an expensive city, this place is reasonably price - no more expensive than a standard brunch in Melbourne for example. The cafe itself had a cool vibe and decor and very pleasant and accommodating staff.
5
I came here for brunch with some friends. The cafe is well decorated, the staff are lovely and the music is good. The food was great, one of my friends had the granola and 2 of us had the pancake stack. Be warned, the pancake stack is huge and could easily be shared between two. We both ended up taking half of it home. Would definitely recommend this place
4
this cafe is in located on the second level of a row of shop houses. so be prepared to climb up some stairs. they do not take any reservations so if you want to just find a place to chill, avoid the lunch time. my colleagues and i went on a friday afternoon for lunch and it was full when we got there. we had to wait a little while for a table. food wise, it is yummy. love the selections which are not that huge that it gives you a headache in choosing. our meals were delicious - we had sandwich, pasta and pie. the desserts - especially the ice cream, and coffee are really good. the staff are not too bad - you order your food, pay at the counter and they serve you. so i would definitely return on a less crowded and noisy mid week afternoon. duxton hill is a very lovely place to just spend an afternoon strolling and group theraphy is just the place to have a cup of coffee/tea and cake and chill
3
As this is a very short walk from my son's apartment we had to give this a go. I had already walked passed earlier in the day and it was almost full and as I had already hady coffee fix gave it a miss. Back for simple dinner, the menu is quite short but ok, Sam had the cottage pie, which looked ok, I had the steak and cheese pie which again was ok. This is not fine dinning but basic food which is most probably mass produced. I also had a Japanese beer which I would recommend. Would I eat here again? Yes and now I want to go back and try their coffee
4
I went to Group Therapy on Sunday afternoon so it's a bit crowded but i managed to get a seat by the window. The coffee is good and I really like the lemon tart here. The price is average comparing to other cafes here. Though, it tends to be noisy since it sunday afternoon so i would suggest you to go there other time if you want peace and quite place to sit, read and sip your coffee
4
Went there with my sister on Saturday in the evening. The place was not too crowded, ample space between tables. Ordered bolognese and shepherd's pie. The portions were larger than expected and the food was good, definitely would return.
4
Very busy place. Beef cheese burger was amazing, especially with the egg. First time trying a chilli crab pie which was interesting. Waffles were alright, probably because we were too full after the mains!
3
My friend and I visited on a Saturday afternoon. It was rather crowded. Tables for two people are not very spaced out. We had pancake stack. It's topped with fresh berries and you have a choice between maple syrup or seasalt caramel topping. I felt that the seasalt caramel was a bit dry, so I would recommend maple syrup for the pancakes. The cafe's Chili Crab Pie was not bad. Its sides include salad and chips. A dish with rather unique combination. On a side note, the cafe does not accept reservations
2
I went there with 5 other friends (6 of us) for a late night all-day brunch. We were sent to the waiting area and were told we will be given the next available table. 3 of us were seated while the other 3, went to use the toilet during which a table became available. They then asked if all of us are present since most cafes have the "all must be here to be seated" policy. I told them about the situation. A male staff went to check, and even after verifying that they were indeed at the restroom area, he still decided to give the table to those that just arrived after us saying that we don't have all members present even though it was clear to see. We decided that it was a great day, and don't want to ruin it by causing a fuss. Unfortunately, everything went downhill from there.The male service crew then influenced the other service crews, who started giving hard stares and horrible attitude using passive aggressive looks and tones even though we did not point out their mistakes.Not only did they not apologise or show remorse, they continued to give aggressive tones and rude body language throughout our meal.The only saving grace was the ambience and the food. We ordered 2 Poached Eggs, Croissant and Scramble Eggs, 2 Croque Madame, and a Bacon & Mushroom Aglio Olio. Poached Eggs has great Hollandaise Sauce, although the egg is overdone. Croissant and Scrambled Eggs has really good salad, but the eggs lack in seasoning.Croque Madame is well done.Aglio Olio is not recommended as it is too salty for my taste.I believe the major factor to make a person feel comfortable at a cafe is its service, but with such untrained and passive aggressive staff, the whole experience is really negative. Perhaps, their staff culture need a major review.I really regret that although they have great food and ambience, their staff ruin the entire experience. I love the whole cafe culture, but this experience is too horrid and I will not return again
3
I came here with my 5 colleagues during lunch time on a Friday. The cafe was located a level 2. This cafe is very spacious and relaxing. The place was packed but we still managed to get seats. They serve all day breakfast and delicious pies. We can also create our own set by combining the sides that we want. I have tried the chilli crab pie, it came with chips and vegetables. Would certainly come again
2
We ordered the bacon and mushroom aglio olio and the salmon avocado multigrain.The aglio Olio was a huge disappointment while the salmon sandwich was Mediocre-nothing to rave about considering it costs $18.Did not get to try the desserts.Not sure if I will be back again
5
Had 5 days in Singapore and my daughter chose Group Therapy for a breakfast because it sounded a bit quirky and LOVED it! We went twice because it was so comfortable to be there and you MUST try the pancake stack with honeycomb pieces and fresh berries. OMG it was amazing. I had the caramel sauce instead of the traditional maple syrup and I loved that it came in a separate jug for you to control how much you poured over it. (Of course I used the lot) The atmosphere is lovely with a food scoop as a door handle. A push bike inside and just lots of little things everywhere to look at. The food was delicious and its not very often I get an "extra hot" coffee when I ask for one but this place got it right straight up. The staff are friendly and it was just a lovely casual dining experience. Make sure you try this place at least once. I know I will go back on another trip

We ate here for brunch on a Sunday and overall, found it fairly satisfying.Food was about average. We ordered: + Poached eggs on thick toast, guacamole, ham and cheese ($16). It didn't disappoint nor did it wow (note we switched sunny side eggs up for poached eggs).+ Ravioli with truffle oil ($ 18) was nice. Would recommend this dish.- Mint Mocha ($6.50) was OK for the novelty factor, but would probably not order this again.- Matcha latte ($6.50) tasted like the Starbucks version.Ambiance was fairly good - Decor was mismatched and bric-a-brac, quite interesting. There was a bookshelf but I did not get a chance to check it out.Value was fairly good - Felt the prices charged for the quality of food we had was about right. There was also no service charge. I felt this was fair as water, cutlery and condiments are self-serve

My friends took me along this cafe.I ordered pancake which is only for weekends. Although it was expensive just as like as ordinary cafe in Singapore, I was satisfied. Because it had quite big volume the taste was really nice.As I mentioned, here food is expensive and has high volume, I recommend you to go with your friend at least 3 and share with them

We went to the branch at Katong V. It was around 2 pm, so there were a number of seating areas free, ranging from the two armchairs to 4-seater tables.We ordered the black and white coffee, as well as the honey lemon tea. The slice of apple pie was quite generous, though I found it to be rather dry. The two drinks and apple pie came up to $20, which was on the high side.But it's a good place to chill out

Too crowded. Too hot. Food is disappointing. Like the decoration of the place, especially the toilet. So cute door.

We had the whole place reserved for an event that was attended by around 50 persons. The place was cool with its vintage look and the food was nice. I love the ambience of the place and this is perfect for intimate gatherings.

Order at the counter, lame hipster atmosphere and most importantly the food is not good.
Cheers....................

The ambience is pretty good. The cafe also isn't too crowded. The coffee is above average but one really goes there more to chill. Didn't try the food

We had a great meal here, good quality home made pasta ( slightly over al dente for one guest though). The menu was really good and a welcome change from oriental food.

We decided to venture here despite reading mixed reviews. I love trying new brunch places, so was looking forward to this. Despite being tucked away upstairs on a quiet street, we managed to find the place with little difficulty. We went at a good time as well, Saturday noon - it was bustling but there were enough free tables. We had the Sunny side up (without the bacon - what was particularly nice was that one of the servers came up after my placing the order to check whether I'd like to sub out the meat with mushrooms), Belgian Waffles with Maple syrup and butter, Seasalt Potato Crisps, a side of Scrambled Eggs, and the Roasted Almond Latte.The sunny-side up breakfast was gorgeous - perfectly fried eggs with slightly runny yokes, sauteed garlic mushrooms, crisp wholemeal toast, and guacamole. My only peeve was the generosity with the lime in the guacamole, else it was delicious and filling. The scrambled eggs were well done, flavoured well, and the right consistency. The waffles were fluffy and tasty. The lattes rounded off the meal perfectly. Another mention would be for the pricing - the quantity of food is just right and the prices are better than a lot of other brunch restaurants - most of them being overpriced.It would be great if there were more vegetarian options, but I'd recommend trying Group Therapy. I'd definitely like to go back

The first 2 times I was there the experience was quite pleasant and I enjoyed the food greatly. Had their waffles on both occasions and their carrot cake. However recently when I was there, I ordered their bacon and mushroom aglio olio and was a bit disappointed. Not only was it very oily, the bacon also tasted a little strange. My friend had the hunter chicken which she said was not too bad. So I guess it boils down to what you order.However the whole ambience of the place is nice and the service staff are quite helpful and friendly. Not a bad place to spend an afternoon with friends. But try not to sit at the back. It's very warm there despite the many fans and an air con unit since it's near to the kitchen

Went there for a farewell lunch for a colleague at their Katong V branch. Had a group of 10, luckily some got there at 12.15, as the place filled up pretty quickly (I guess they have about 10 tables) and they don't take reservations. Good thing is that the place is open from 9am to 9pm.They have an all-day breakfast menu. Four of us shared the - Caesar Salad ($13.91)- Beef burger ($20.33)- Beef and cheddar pie ($16.05)- Chicken mushroom pie ($14.98)- Salmon Avocado multigrain ($12.84)I also had the cappuccino ($5)It's supposed to be a coffee place, but I felt that the cappuccino was a bit diluted and did not have the right aroma. My colleague had a latte and she said it tasted a bit burnt.But the food was good. My measure of a good Caesar Salad is in the egg and bacon, and did they deliver. It was a nicely poached egg sitting on the bed of lettuce, and it was actual strips of bacon and not just bacon bits. It could do with a bit more cheese, but it doesn't distract from a good salad.They did not ask about doneness, and though it came out medium well, it was still quite juicy. Tasted of real meat and not just fillers. Topped with a well-done egg (because we were sharing, else would have been a sunny-side up). Will recommend this if you are a burger type of person. Fries a bit soggy though.Salmon Avocado multigrain was delicious though I would have liked to have a bit more smoked salmon (I'm the greedy sort). Overall was good and the bread was yummy. And it was the best value I feel.Beef pie was a bit dry on the inside. Could do with more gravy and more pieces of beef. But was tasty and I liked the pastry.Chicken pie was better, I preferred this to the beef pie. It was more moist and had more pieces of chicken. But at $15 and $16 respectively for the chicken and beef pie, I felt it was a bit expensive.I would come back again for the food though not for the coffee. Multigrain and Caesar Salad, and then try some of their other menu items which has a good range. Average spend per pax was about $20-$25. I have included their phone number as I couldn't find it on the web (and it was on their namecard)

Stumbled on this nice cafe while walking around at Duxton hill. I would have missed this cafe located on the 2nd floor of a shophouse if not for its signboard.The coffee and food is good. I liked the overall cosy feel of the place and friendly servic

A place with unique design and concept goes with Juicy Beef Cheese Burger, Tasty Steak & Cheese Pie, Mouthwatering Poached Egg on Thick Toast.. Makes my Friday, the 13th lunch wonderful..Kudos to the chef and servers

Very good coffee and nice environment. I also love the fact that is not so exposed and a bit hard to find: it makes the whole experience worth it!

Peaceful to hide with laptop and too many coffees...

Hi Tourist,If you're along duxton road looking for a cafe to rest your feet. Do consider Group Therapy, the cafe is directly above Etna Italian restaurant on Duxton road. Their menu is quite limited with choices but they serve good unpretentious food.I had their all day breakfast, Smoked Salmon on thick toast. It was fantastic.A quiet hideout away from the city for coffee & relax your day away

The cafe is tucked away on the second floor of a shophouse along Duxton Hill. As you enter the café, you get a warm and relaxing feel with a combination of sofas and chairs to laze around and hence it is ideal for conversations over coffee. I went for dinner and tried the ‘Vegetable Quiche’ and ‘Truffled Ravioli’ which were quite good. They have quite an interesting set of coffee blends which seem to have literally gone through the grind. The desserts were really good, tried the ‘Pecan Pie’ and ‘Raspberry and White Chocolate mini loaf’ and would recommend the same

Found this place tucked away upstairs on Duxton Rd. Walking in it's quite busy compared to the road outside. Greeted with a warm welcome and shown to our seats. Not a long wait compared to how busy they were. Menu has a good selection, was tempted by the BBQ Ribs but we ended up going for the steak & cheese pie, chicken and mushroom pie and the ham & cheese panini. The pies and panini where excellent and reminded me so much of what we would get at home in New Zealand. Coffee is up there with the best. Loved the busy atmosphere and the service was great. Will be back for sure :

Intend to have brunch with my wife at Pigeonhole only to find out that it was already closed , so stumbled upon this cafe just a few doors away and on the second floor. The setting and ambience was good like most of these Indy cafes that have been populating our little island. It was quite crowded considering it was Saturday and without the office crowd. That raised my expectations. To my dismay , the menu was very limited in choices and primarily serving pies. The rest are specials and seasonal and not always available. The price was also high by cafe standard so we decide to order a chicken pie along with two coffee. The sight of our food when it arrives was not even appetizing to the eyes , and it tastes worst than it looks. The pie resembles those you get off the supermarket , albeit bigger in size. The skin and ingredients inside was tasteless and we struggled to finish it. The coffee was equally bad , and a far cry from what I could get in most cafes in Singapore. The overall experience was bad considering the ridiculous price ($30 in total) and the poor quality of the food and drinks. I am a strong believer of meeting basic expectations irrespective of the line of business we are in and this place has definitely fell short in their delivery. I am certainly not returning for future visit

Coffee tastes mild for me. But it's a great place to have a little time for myself. I wish they offer more bites up there because i know a few good cafes that offers good coffees and a good selection of food to go with. I would say, more sandwich options will be perfect, the working people would love it. It's easy for us to take one on the go and not too heavy for a snack in between our work time. love some of the creative ideas they have! Cute cups and recycled bottles for water

It was a Sunday and we (daughter and I) decided to check this place out for lunch. Based on a recommendation we were told to call 10 minutes before to check if there was a crowd because they don't take reservations. We were told it was ok.Went into the crowded and noisy place (but quaint) and proceeded to sit on this high table with high chairs with 5 other strangers. Its that kind of place. Very rustic, noisy with people, cooking and washing behind the serving counter, in full view of everyone.We ordered the steak pie and the eggs with cheese and salmon on a toast. And coffee , of course! We were not disappointed. The coffee was great and the meals pretty good too. There was free flow of plain water which came in a recycled fruit juice bottle. Then the bill! s$46.55 for what is really decent breakfast. I thought about it. If it was 2 meals (brunch) then it should be ok but this was certainly not cheap given the surroundings, total lack of privacy and the incredible noise. If you were a tourist looking for some rustic place on a lazy Sunday this is it but regardless, you will still get sticker shock no matter which country you are from.I'd have to feel extremely rich on a Sunday to come back for this brunch. Even Ramen at Tori just down the road will not set us back s$46.55

We tried this new place for a brunch and it was really good. The location is quiet. And the prices are reasonable.Granola & muesli yogurt is perfect if you just woke up! Fresh strawberries!! The roasted almon latte is also excellent! Looking forward to go back

I went here for a late afternoon brunch, even at 4pm there was a wait of 15 minutes so this place is popular. The ambiance is very nice, it feels like a place where you can spend an afternoon with a nice cup of coffee.The food here is good, I tried the poached eggs ($15) which were excellent. The Madame Croque ($18), a Sunday special was also very good and made with a good amount of quality cheese and a thick slice of ham. It was too heavy for my taste but a good choice.The coffee ($4-7) was well made and they provide plenty of complimentary water.Overall worth visiting though it is on the pricey side
