Great experience, so near to my work place but discovered almost after 16 months working in SG. Chris & Eline were friendly. Seating near bar counter is bit to cold though so be in your jackets... The place need more staff in the evening though. Cheers & experience the fantastic friendly hospitality

Nice bar to chill at. Pity their opening hours have moved to 5pm. It used to be a nice place to chill while the afternoon sun beat down on the busy streets and crowded holiday shopping centre.Manned by staff with superb, attentive service, expect to enjoy slightly cheaper drinks during Happy Hours. Bar snacks is also another highlight with fresh crisps and nuts to pair with your choice of beverage. Non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages allow for a wide choice of fluids for you to enjoy.I recommend the various cocktails, concocted by the well train bartenders. Trust me, for a short girl, she shakes up some of the best cocktails in this island. Enthusiastic and willing to serve every need of the customer. That is service excellence, indeed.Introbar also has live football if you're a fan. Well placed flat-screen TVs ensure that you are entertained from all angles. Otherwise, sit by the window and watch the world walk by

After 10 days in Singapore, thinking service and friendliness couldn't get better, l thought ld checkout this hidden little chill-out place called Introbar. A nice relaxing place with service and smiles that you just dont see out there. A beautiful greeting from ChrisMarie was very inviting refreshing to see. Originally l just went there for winding down coffee, l left 2 pints and a gin n tonic, and thats due to closing time orelse l would've had more ; ). Great service with a genuine smile and a great attitude is hard to find, and Chris ticks all the boxes, thank you so much, and looking forward to attend Introbar on my next trip again for sure, only this time it'll be on the first day, not on my last ;

After our high tea at anti:dote , went for some drinks at introbar. Amazing hidden gem. The service from Chrisma, Aiza and Dahye if I spell it correctly were amazing. They were very friendly and recommended drinks that were balanced and taste really good. Genuine service is what we really need in Sg. I am extremely impress with the service people at Introbar and will surely visit again. Love the gin and jam cocktail!

Amazing service, great drinks good bar food. The service from Chris and Dahy the two bar maids is the reason we kept coming back. Very attentive, knowledgable on the local area giving us recommendations on where to spend our spare time while visiting. Will definitely be back

We stay here for a week once a month as we do a load of business in Singapore. The hotel is nice and the bar is good. One reason we ALWAYS come for a drink in IntroBar is because Chris is amazing! She is such a great, friendly bar tender. I wish all bar tenders were like her. She's our favourite. And she says apart from "the American" guys we are her favourite guests! Go see her and say hello!

We stopped in for a drink after a long day. Lovely setting! I first tried the passion fruit Bellini. It was too sweet for me, but still delicious. Our favourite drink (although pricy) was one called the pimmlet (something like that... Excuse the spelling.) WORTH it

Great service. Small and intimate, almost private on a busy shopping Saturday afternoon.Skipped in for an afternoon to hide from the hot sun. Ended up with a couple of pints and a refreshing sour cocktail. Thanks to Chris and Min Hee for your impeccable service. Beer bites were more than adequate.Cheers

What I love about this place when I went with friends for a night out last month was their very cozy seats, light music and prompt service. Would recommend looking for Aizza or Melanie for some stellar cocktails. Moreover, they are very attentive and really know their products very well. Will most likely go back again to chill and unwind. A great place to have drinks and chat with friends all night long.
