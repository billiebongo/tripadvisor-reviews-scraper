I had the dark chocolate 2 scoops, very delicious. Fave has promotion which is a good buy. I had these various times.

6" chocolate cake is S$33 and a single scoop of creamy, rich and divine ice cream is S$4.50 A super duper treat! It is worth it. Give it a try the next time you encounter their kiosk.

I loved the chocolate cake, cups lava cake and the coffee with latte art and 3D latte art on it. There were a few branches, I visited the one in Bugis Junction.

These people know their chocolate, especially their dark chocolate. I go here especially for the scoop of their signature dark chocolate gelato, a connoisseurs delight. Its got a velvetty texture, not-so-sweet and a heart of pure chocolate goodness. The cakes here are fantastic as well.

We originally ordered one Chocolate Lava to share, but we ended up ordering three for each of us. Not much to say but it is pretty delicious. Recommended to try!

Just to share, I'm utterly disappointed with today's visit (around 8pm) at Kallang Wave outlet for a single scoop gelato at usual price $4.50, and this is what I get. Looks aside, quantity is miserable. As a fan of chocolate origin for a long time, especially the dark gelato, be it which outlet, its portion for even a single scoop has always been consistent. Even with the fave promo, quality and quantity is consistent. With today's standard, do you think it is worth to patronize again if this continues?Gave a low rating specifically pertaining to this visit, if base on past experience it would definitely at least 4/5.

Had 1-for-1 promo from snatch for the lava cake making it really affordable! Queue free and quick service from bugis outlet. Chocolate was a little sweet but when paired with the plain vanilla ice cream, it tastes really amazing. Warm chocolate lava cake that they heat up, icy cold vanilla ice cream. However a little too rich for 1 pax to finish, perhaps more bittersweet would be tastier for the chocolate.

the outlet at jurong point has seats for patrons to enjoy their hot chocolate and cake.the cup lava cake is a bit pricey but it tasted very chocolatey..the chocolate oozes out from the tiny cake.however the dark chocolate gelato was a let down to me.think because it is dark chocolate thus it has bitter taste however it is very thick and hard to scoop up..maybe wet tissue can be provided for patrons who eat the gelato..maybe they should launch chocolate gelato too.overall very quiet ambience and i will visit again

I'm a chocolate lover and i really love this lava cake. It's so yummy and it will bring you happy mood.When i buy it, i have to take it home because i can't find a share table (it's lunch time back then). I'm kinda worried that the taste is going to be weird, but turns out it's not.Still the same taste like if you eat it in there.If you are a chocolate lover, you have to try this
