Not a restaurant but a stall at a hawker centre, their nasi lemak is one of the best I have tried. Fragrant coconut rice, wonderfully tasty chili (but not too hot), wonderful fried chicken wings, it's one of my favourite indulgences since I work around here. It's not too expensive either - it's about $2-$3, depending on what you choose.Only downside is that there's always a long queue, be it breakfast or lunch
