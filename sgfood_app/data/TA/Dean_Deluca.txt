I absolutely love their coffe and their granole! I think the owners are two brothers, they open early in the morning, they're so nice to customers and they offer good food in a nice, clean friendly enviroment!

Met several people at the restaurant when it opened in the morning. Service was slow and portions were small for the price. Flat white was very good but my eggs were too runny.

Staying at the Amoy Hotel around the corner, went in for complimentary breakfast. The Amoy is lovely, staff are lovely, nice boutique vibe. But walking into this cafe, the vibe is very different: kind of couldn't-give-a-stuff, and franchise-chain-trying-to-be-boutique. I'm vegan and none of the main course choices were vegan so I told the server this. Some negotiation followed, during which he suggested I have (1) eggs and (2) cheese. I expended a bit of energy to bat those idiotic suggestions away, and opted for bread with avocado and tomato. Out it came, a couple of slices of supermarket bread, toasted, but with butter baked into it during the toasting process. Listen up Dean & Deluca: to have someone running one of your chain restaurants, who hasn't even had the gumption to google "vegan" at any point in his life ... this is not good. Smarten up

Tried to get some water to go with my coffee and lunch. Turns out company policy is to only ‘sell’ water. Talk about gouging from customers. Not the fault of the staff, of course, who are standing next to the sink and have a large selection of cups ‘It’s the policy sir’. This is in Singapore mind you where dehydration is a real issue. Never going back

If you are a lover of carrot cake this is the place to go...wow..just wow! I love carrot cake - it's my weakness, but not one I indulge in often until now 2 x in 2 days!! It's exquisite...unlike anything you will ever have tasted and btw the granola, homemade, that you can get at breakfast is pretty awesome too!! Service is great and the crew are friendly as can be!!

I stayed next door at the AMOY and breakfast was included in my room rate. I met some clients at this place for breakfast who did not stay at the hotel. The food was ok, the servers to me seemed to be less friendly to hotel guests than regular guests, other reviewers found just the opposite. I had basic scrambled eggs and sausage, which came out pretty promptly (you order at the counter then they bring the food to you once ready). There are better options nearby from what I have read, I would not seek this place out if I wasn't staying next door or in the area. Passable fare, no real customer service at all, just ok

Stayed at the Amoy Hotel around the corner and the complimentary breakfast is served at Dean & Deluca (cordoned off area in the restaurant for hotel guests).Opted for the smoked salmon and eggs Benedict which was excellent. Service was good but noticeably friendlier to hotel guests than normal customers

We have had 3 breakfasts here. Have been staying close by and have had a really good experience of this cafe. Sitting inside, it is cosy and relaxed. A good choice of food and I have enjoyed everything I have had. All staff have been very welcoming, courteous and obliging. A lovely start to our day

Wanted to have a comfortable place and decent breakfast and came across this cafe, ambience just ok anyway, I think the croissant was a bit too small, salmon also very tiny slices, coffee is big size but coffee is not too expensive though, overall I think it should be like at $8 for the max, $10 was a bit too expensive. Taste was good

when we booked at the Amoy Hotel on Telok Street we knew breakfast was included - what we didn't know was that the breakfast was actually at D&D - the restaurant next door - one of the best hotel breakfast experiences - good food, delivered fast and with friendly staff. We were there for 4 breakfasts - two on a weekend and two on weekdays. Each day we had different offerings plus juice, coffee, fruits and bread. It was just a wonderful way to start our tourist day

food quality is so so.
service is very minimal.
the only good bit, is on the variety of foods they sell.
packaged goodies, and those cooking ingredients.
yet, prices are steep.

Beautiful refreshing cafe, light and airy which serves good quality coffee and teas. As for the desserts on offer just try to stop me! The strawberry cheesecake tart and citrus cheesecake were fantastic.
Only wish I discovered this place sooner!

Went here for after dinner desserts and have heard the name of this place earlier...supposed to be good for desserts. But we were not at all impressed. the carrot cake and forest berries mousse, both didnt seem fresh at all!

Great to see this well known quality chain make it Singapore. The usual selection of good coffees, sandwiches and other food. Tightly packed tables but ok if not too busy.

Crowded with nice staff struggling to work effectively. Strange kiwi fruit drink but delicious smoked chicken caesar salad but prices high and I got bored with the conversation of another customer three tables away. There are much better outlets close by.

We went there today by taxi (so we went specially) for a few basic reasons when choosing a cafe : good coffee, wifi and, hopefully phone sockets to charge phones. Whilst the last one is probably too much to ask, we did expect wifi and good coffee! We got neither. I asked for skim milk - "ok" then it was dumped at our table by a waitress who didn't say anything ... they were both the same when we tasted them. The breakfast was mediocre at best. And Expensive!!!Have been before but will not go again, We crossed to road to Segafreda (and free wifi) and the staff were lovely - such a contrast. Lesson learned in a city full of plac s to get coffee, good service and wif

We popped by Dean & Deluca for a quick cup of coffee and a snack. Got the Cappuccino, White Mocha, and a Pear-Hazelnut Tart. The coffees were average. The tart was surprisingly nice, though the hazelnut flavour didn't pop at all. It's definitely over priced for the quality not being spectacular
2
The food is nice and of good quality (but not sure about the cakes and pastries...). The service isn't very good as they don't smile and are quite impatient. The food is rather expensive and you could go somewhere else for similar food at lower prices

It was my first time. Ambience is nice but when it gets crowded it's not so nice. Staff gave average service but a tad slow cos understaffed. Prices are not cheap. Will come again to try their cake/pastry. *the one in orchard road is permanently closed.

Lots of merchandise for sale. If only they paid attention to the food. Had meatball sandwich came in a bun that had the texture of cotton wool. Serving staff meant well but looked fed up and tired (at just 8.30pm)Not one for a repeat visit.
