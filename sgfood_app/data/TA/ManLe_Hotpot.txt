If you’re a senior citizen, porridge lunch buffet is affordable at $10.90 all week long. The spread is palatable, ranging from braised chicken feet, pork slices, peanuts, fish head or tail, salted egg yolk, steam egg, sweet potatoes amongst others. One word of caution tho, for those who have peanuts and eggs allergies are that their tongs and serving ware are kind of mixed up by customers while using them to scoop up their food and their dessert is abysmal with only oranges, watermelon and cocktail mix. However, it’s worth a try should you have a craving for porridge.

We went there last Saturday evening for dinner with my family including the children. The price of $28.80+ Child $18.80. Wide spread of buffet of food seafood, chilled meat, Fish, Prawns, Crabs, different kind of broth Soup, Vegetables, Free flow of drinks and Ice Cream. The waiter & waitresses were polite and very helpful. This restaurant do served Teochew Porridge Buffet in the afternoon. I would highly recommended you book a table before visiting don't worry about space its so huge with wide choice of and good selection of food

I went on a weekday evening for dinner, and I must say I am really impressed by the value for money one year anniversary promotional price of $19.90+ per pax. What I love most of was the open concept kitchen cum buffet line where the chefs were behind the ingredients counter always topping up the dishes with freshly prepped ingredients.The was also a wide variety of food ingredients including free flow drinks and ice cream!Service was great, waiters were attentive and were quick to help clear the plates.They top up all soup with chicken stock by default though, which came as a surprise for my husband who is a flexible vegetarian and had requested for mushroom soup on his side, but when I requested if we could not top up our soup with chicken because of his dietary preference, the waiters and waitresses were really kind to specially top his with the original mushroom stock and even gave us a pitcher so we could fill it up on our own.Their usual price of $28.80+ is indeed steep but given the great experience, I think it would have been worthwhile for special occasions. Will definitely kiv for my next family dinner celebration and look out for promotions.The branch/ I went to was at downtown east resort area, and Saturday night the queue to enter the restaurant was crazy, weekday nights are better, but close to 7.30pm the place looks full as well, highly recommended to book a table before visiting

Went there last week for Hot Pot dinner with Family. Great choice of stocks (individual) so no fighting over who gets what. Excellent. Wide choice of fresh and well chilled meats and seafood. Good selection of veggies too! Place got style and is not noisy! Will certainly be back..

Tried for the first time with my family including 3 kids. Surprisingly good. Wide spread including seafood. Crab, fish, prawn, meats, broth, etc. were good. Price also includes Teochew porridge buffet. Quite value for money. Service was also good. Staff were polite and helpful. Last but not least, place was spacious. I would certainly go again.Recommended

Overall experience was great! Had dinner on 24 December thus fully booked, its a good thing i made reservations. Food was sufficient and was replenished (not very quickly but good enough). Everything was okay except for the crabs, they were not fresh.. they were mushy and been kept frozen or under ice for a long time. Also, service was great but i saw one of the food attendant (the meat and seafood section- big lady) use bare hands to handle the meat. (DTE outlet

place is spacious, food spread quite extensive for both cooked and raw food. the seafood was fresh. te soup base was fantastic and innovative, me and some of my friends had the soup of the month which is the seafood porridge base, one of my friend had her porridge burnt and the serving staff was kind enough to change another pot of soup base for her
2
The sliced pork and pig trotters was not tasty at all as it was not well marinated! The bitter gourd was not soft enough.
3
Variety not too much.. Porridge not warm enough... Food taste normal... Probably the dinner buffet is better.
4
Good place for gathering. I like the place because its near other entertainment places like wild wild wet etc. Wide selection of food and fresh

Dinner buffet spread was alot better than the lunch teochew buffet.
The spread is pretty limited, but nonetheless will be back.
5
The hotpot variety was very worth it. Some of the cooked foods tastes very nice. Like especially the whole restaurant was played with Chinese songs

It was our first dine out at Manle Hotpot. The wait was short since we had booked in advanced. Many soup base choices. Great for family dinner!

Had a great time at Manle (pasir ris) with their dinner buffet. Everything was good, but the seafood was not fresh. Overall I rate this 4/5 and will definitely come back!

Long queue for food as all items are placed very near each other. Shd spread out the food so that pple won't block others taking other food items.

Tried both the steamboat & porridge buffet. Steamboat buffet served at night & has a good spread of food including cooked food to ease the rumbling stomach while waiting for food to be cooked (^^). The porridge buffet also has a reasonable no. of dishes & dishes will be updated along the way hence if you are there long enough, you will be able to try different dishes. Service staff clear the dishes promptly & are friendly & helpful

The service is quite slow, despite the number of staff walking around. Some don't seem to be paying attention to the customers. Most of them, the younger girls especially, are quite good. They have initiative and will put effort into trying to serve the customers. The older ones don't even try. The management should replace all older staff with young people. The plump girl at the reception area is horrible. I had a reservation and she chose to serve the walk-in customers first. What is the point of a reservation queue then?The food is good, but the seafood is not particularly fresh, ESPECIALLY the squid. They have also removed cuttlefish from the menu, which is sad
