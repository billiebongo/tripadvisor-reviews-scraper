Went here for lunch as recommended by a fellow hotel guest , we enjoyed it and went back twice more .
The Hawaiian pizza and garlic bread were great at midnight after a long day at the Grand Prix .
Would recommend .

Singapore is known to be an expensive country for F&B and it is. However, there are many places that truly provides a value for money experience through and through. Hannibal is one such place. It is located at Robertson Walk, which is possibly the most beautiful alfresco dinning street in the country. It’s predominantly a sports bar, aptly displaying football matches on all its screens. The menu is well crafted for that perfect bar experience and all prices therein are on nett value, which is so convenient. What really surprised me was the price of alcohol including the bottle service. The food too was excellent, large in quantities. The staff are extremely warm and welcoming, which is always vital to make the guest experience extra special. I highly recommend this venue.

In an area with a wide choice of restaurants of all types, Hannibal Grill stood out for us as being basic, reasonably priced and popular with locals.Dinner – a shared starter of fried calamari, followed by pasta dishes and with one glass of wine and a 500ml glass of draught beer came to SIN$70.Service was friendly and food arrived promptly and was very tasty.And on an evening with heavy thunder and rain it was great to be able to sit outside under cover, rather than having to go into an air conditioned room

Seriously the service is brilliant in this place! The staff is always smiling, join into the jokes and still get the job done! The food is very decent for a bar/pub and consistent which is important! The fries were disappointing (like sticks of crispy oil) but recently they have done them better while also adding some new items on their menu at reasonable price. I still don't know how they manage to deliver on so much food and keep it decent.. The Menu seems huge but hey if it works

This bar makes out it is the Welsh Rugby supporters bar in Singapore, yet when I go there to watch a game, they tell me they are not showing it, only the football...! The service, food, etc are all poor from experience too, so think it’s time the Welsh found a better and more loyal place to support their team from :

Hannibal is a laid back open air restaurant and bar at the heart of Robertson's Quay. It looks onto a square that has several restaurants and bars. It has a generous mix of high top and low tops and is great for drinks, appetizers (the pizza was surprisingly good), and a casual meal. The service was very good and fast. All around a very good spot to hang out or have a casual meal. I will definitely good back
4
OK, so situated amongst so many food outlets you expect swift service with decent food and an atmosphere that invites but wants you gone once you have eaten. And I wad not disappointed. Are the tables distressed by a chic designer or a mark of shoddiness? Whatever you find here I hope you get what you want
2
We hoped to have a nice dinner. Waiters totally indifferent, do not smile or communicate politely. Pizza was vey dry and tastless. Bland crust like carboard...poor quality sauce was not fresh. They advertise wood fired pizza. This is not true. The pizza tasted bad and dry so i walked over and saw them making the pizza. No wood fired oven. It was gas fired and i took pictures and videos to prove it. The foid in general was low quality and tge waiters could not care less. Waited forever to get their attention. Low quality place. Will not return

Hi always go to hannibal during weekends,if I'm around also during the week
Is good place,always tv with matches,mma etc and the prices are good for the location
4
Very funky bar with nice food and great service.Good place to people watch and just a very relaxing experience.Beef Kebab and chicken steak was very tasty,staff were very efficient and friendly,highly recommended,very extensive menu selection including pizza if you desire.
3
Nice bar in Robertson Quay with good service and wine and outdoor space. Not expensive and busy location in the heart of the action.
5
I loved this place. The pizza was very delicious and appetizing.
The drinks were awesome. The service was quick. A great place to hang out with friends
4
Hannibal is a casual sports bar with TV screens for the fans. It is very casual, but the staff are professional. We Came for a late evening meal and had chicken wings and mussels for starters, then moved on to James Brown Burgers. The food was great, and service was good
4
No matter how many times I go back to Singapore, I always end up back at this bar. The food is great, the drinks selection is large and the staff are friendly. With multiple TV and projector screens, various sports showing all the time along with music to fill the gaps
4
Visted on a Thursday evening with my family as we were staying at Fraser Place and wanted somewhere close for dinner.They had the AFL on tv at the bar so that made us, being Aussies, feel at home. Some patrons did get a bit excited and that made it very loud. Don't go if you want a quiet sit down dinner. As my family all decided on pizza we thought that the most economical option was the metre long pizza they offer. Didn't disappoint! Pizza was thin crust and had good toppings. Definitely made sure we were full. I ordered a glass of rosÃ© which was a bit disappointing but overall it was a good experience and made us feel at home at Singapore

Dropped in on spec on a Sunday evening in April whilst on a four day visit to Singapore. Very reasonable prices and beers were ice cold. We had John Brown burger and whole spring chicken respectively and were not disappointed. Tiger beers were S$8 each. Football was on in background but didn't dominate.The place was busy which is a good sign but there was still plenty of seating. There were families with children there, couples and mates out for a beer - a nice mix.Definately worth seeking out if in the area
4
After spending a number of nights eating and drinking here I would happily now call it my local while in Singapore. The bar has ample seating both inside and out, with the outside covered by awnings from the sun, but they don't work to well in heavy rain. The bar has a very good selection of beer, wine and sprits, maybe a few more on draft would be an bonus. Then there is the food selection, very good is all I can say. Pizza from their own pizza oven, pasta, steak, tapas, burgers to name a few. All food is of good proportion and very good quality. To top things of the staff are very friendly and remember a face
4
This bar/restaurant is bar first I think. Soccer matches were very loud, service was good to start with then fell off after our food was delivered. Seemed to be a shift change, and new people did not pay attention to customers already there. Food quality was excellent
2
The vegetarian lasagna was a fail, they put sauce on my husbands burger after specifically asking for no sauce and then after paying the bill they didn't bring the change. We were late for an event so we just gave up and left.
5
Went for a simple dinner. The service was excellent and the waiter advised us of our food selection. Good basic food and prices are net. Calamari, Caprese salad and a mixed sausage player with 2 glasses of cider cost $66. Good value and tasty food.
5
Just loved it here...great sports bar venue, food was awesome, drinks are cold, service is good, & prices are inclusive of taxes & charges.
So good, we visited twice!
Recommended by us :-)

Lots of outdoor seating in the central of a restaurant/retail arcade area. Pizza is very good. Salad just.ok. No happy hour offers on the day I ate there
4
We had dinner here many times during our stay at Fraser Place Robertson Walk. Its in a great position, very reasonably priced and the staff are very friendly, attentive and helpful. We would definitely come back here to eat.Definitely try the pizza....they are just amazing.....I don't normally eat tomato and cheese pizzas but tried a piece of my sons and had to have one of my own the next night!We also saw a table order a large pizza....and when I say large, I mean large this thing would have been a meter long
4
The service was very professional, friendly and quick. A good selection of international beverages and an Italian based menu. Seating is predominantly outside and the atmosphere depends on the type of customers arriving for dinner. On the night we were there it was fairly quiet - more couples than big party events. We ordered their vegetarian pizza, which arrived at our table in a short amount of time. It was reminiscent of a pizza we had in Rome. Very nice. A pleasant evening. Two drinks and pizza cost S$50
3
Had evening meal, choose the spaghetti vongole, looked good with generous amount of clams.However, it was spicy which is very strange for this meal at first I thought it might be the large slices of garlic in the sauce but after eating a couple of slices worked out it wasn't that. Only assumption I could come to that they had added something which made it spicy without colouring.The location is good and staff friendly and helpful can see it being very busy when there is some sporting events on.Overall it was ok but I wouldn't rush back
1
Went to this bar two nights ago to watch the European Football based on reports on TA of good food. Too bad - private party found another bar to watch.. Ok - understood and accepted.Called this afternoon to ask if there were any private parties tonight - told no. Asked if I could make a reservation to watch the football. Told no need - free seating. Turned up - all tables reserved and not one to bed had with a view of the big screen. Fairly brassed off. As a Welshman reluctant to criticise anything Welsh but this place sucks in attitude.Just had a beer and off to find another bar
4
My partner and I were looking for places to eat close to where we were staying, we chose to stay in the Robertson Quay area for all the great eateries, Hannibal is one we will go back to again.The young lady who welcomed us on our first visit was very friendly, and we had a great meal and a few drinks, I had a Greek style kebab which was delicious.The tables are not too crowded and seating is comfortable.next year Hannibal's will be on the top of our list for dinner
4
We stopped by for a bucket of Carlsberg and a glass of red wine last night after dinner. The chair was comfy to sit and enjoy our drinks outdoor. Outdoor service was very attentive.. Later of the night it was rain, we moved inside next to TV and service wasn't attentive there.
4
Fantastic pizza in this italian gril bar where also other italian dishes are well prepared.
Good selection of beers as well and the staff is friendly, the atmosphere also nice.
Located close to Robinson's Walk Square, nice area.
4
Good variety of food and good ambiance. We sat outside. Well priced for the area. Large portions and good variety. Good happy hour deals.
4
While most nearby eateries are packed, you can usually find a table at Hannibal. Happy Hour prices are a great draw, and the pizza is really good! Also good with kids, as you can keep your eye on them while they scooter nearby.
4
We had dinner twice at Hannibal's during our stay in Chinatown. Compared to neighbouring restaurants, they are a bit cheaper. The pasta dishes were very nice and they make a very nice Shirley Temple.
4
Thumbs up: Happy hour prices, location, and sports-orientation; Thumbs down: Slow service. Tip: If you want to watch a match, definitely one of the best options around Rob Quay.
5
By far the best stone-oven pizza "Diablo" in the area (ask for extra jalapeño's) washed down with a pint of Carlberg. Great service with a smile. Went there quite often.
4
Come here regular for dinner and love their pizza. Cappriosa being my favourite. Good selection of beers and staff is friendly. Great location close to Robinson's Walk Square.
4
So as, great as the local resturants are, sometimes you just need to go back to some basic good food, burger and a beer. Cooked just the way I like, pleasant on the eyes and great on the taste buds. The beer was just an optional extra that just polished it all off.
4
We were looking for an Italian place, and walked past this place initially, but after my wife pointed out that it was busy we decided to give it a try. We shared calamari, garlic bread and the artichoke pizza. The bread was so so but the rest was very hooverable. It was still too much for us to eat , but we happily overindulged as the taste buds won the war over feeling full. The on tap Kronenburg was fresh too. Not too hard on the pocket as well. Almost forgot - the service was very good too - food came out quickly and the staff were attentive. You don't see that in sg that much
5
Don't be put off by bad reviews as it is a sports bar and so during busy sporting events it will be busy and service will not be super quick .... We went on a Wednesday and watched the state of origin match ... Food was very nice , I would recommend the burger it's absolutely incredible ! Stone baked pizzas were also very nice finished off with a large selections of drinks and a wonderful atmosphere
4
We'll worth going just for the pizza. Great atmosphere . We had to move to a larger table just to accommodate the pizza. Not only great value it was yummy.
4
was starving late at night due ti jet lag and this place came to rescue. had a cheap but yummy pizza.
i didnt try anything else on the menu but it was clean, open late and had a mixed menu
3
A place to sit outside with a beer and a snack if you don't want to stay to long.
Close to Clarke Quay but not to close to got the Clarke Quay prices.
4
we enjoyed our meal. lovely grilled chicken, lamb and burgers, fast service, very reasonable price, pleasant place to dine
4
We were looking for a light dinner close to our hotel on our first night in Singapore. The pizza was superb and the staff efficient and friendly.
4
Visited here during our stopover in Singapore. Hannibal's is great for a meal. We had the lasagna, and the gnocci, gorgonzola, and walnut soup - very good service, and fairly well priced.
4
We were staying nearby and wanted something quick and light to eat. This is a fabulous restaurant offering many different foodstuffs. Pizzas/pastas were good as was the hamburger and skewers!
4
great pizza and not only...try the risotto!!
Nice and cozy place for a family meal with a nice walk on the river.
4
Came in several times last couple of years and I Had to rave about their perfectly made pizza that taste totally like those you could find in Italy!Huge portion for the both of us to enjoy for our dinner that was paired with beer!Also Service from the staffs were great as they were attentive to our requests and needs.Pizza is a must order when you are here
4
We were unsure of what to have for dinner and saw people having great looking pizza while sitting up to a table having a few beers.In the end decided on take away. We had a Margherita and good old Ham and Pineapple to go plus a drink while waiting.Pizza were beautiful, hot, great crust and toppings. Excellent Bar for a quick bite to go
4
We came here as the football was on, it was okay, service was good and food good too. If you're looking for a set evening meal and drinks I'd check out the bars nearby.
2
Whilst the food we ordered tasted OK, it was certainly lacking in quantity not enough to feed a child let alone an adult, Don't go here if you are really Hungary.
1
What a joke, been in living in Singapore for 8 years, definitely one of the worst pretend sports bars. Who does a drinks queuing system like this?????
4
Kamasutra pizza was very good. I can recommend it. It's a bar with TV showing sport events, located at the Robertson Qai.
4
This place has nothing especially fancy but the pizza is very good (and I have some expertise to say this) and the beer is at a reasonable price (mostly appreciated in Singapore).
I have also tried the tiramisu and it was good.
4
As there were numerous amounts of restaurants to pick from , we decided to go to Hannibals for a light meal turned out to be very good ,just the right place if you are into people watching very good food service was really great , overall not a bad plac
2
came here Sunday night.and thought it looked ok however we got it wrong. Bruschetta and the pizza were great, really good. Not the same for the service. Really bad. We had to chase our pizza three times and the staff implied it was our fault cos they thought we were going to have a take away - not sure where they got that from! Not us that is for sure. Will not be back
4
We enjoyed our walk down to the quieter area of Robertsons Quay. We had a family meal at this European Bar. We ate outside and thoroughly enjoyed the food especially the pizza. Some other reviewers seem to be unhappy with the service. It was fine for us although the bar was not particularly busy
1
Monday night: Word cup, a full Orange & red house of enthusiast Dutch and Chilean football fans. Tons of atmosphere and loads of beer floating. All groups around me were served with their food, but the staff seamed so buzzy that they did not see that I was trying to order. I asked for the menu without any results. They served me beer instead, but it took ages before My order came trough. Understandable: full house, so the single guest does not have priority. When I finally was able to order, the staff refused to serve me, they were even annoyed that they had to explain that the "Chef" had decided that he did not accept any new orders, not even an order of French fries. The orders from other guests kept coming through, but I could forget it being served. I felt like a wallet on legs, because they kept charging 17 Sin$ for every beer. Bad service, super bad attitude of the staff. Singapore unworthy... By the way: Holland won with 2:0. That kept me there for that night, but I went to bed without my meal for the day..
3
I found the staff friendly an the menu pretty good. Not a great choice of draught beers as should at least have Tiger! Chicken skewers were good and hot. Would come back. Ps found a bug in my salad but that might have arrived after it came to me anyway won't cause any harm :-)
1
No service ... They take order and forget, below average quality food, the place to be avoided in singapore.
4
We've visited several times and a not inconsiderable attraction is that at SGD6 for a drinkable glass of wine and SGD10 for a decent pint of bitter, this, by Singapore standards anyway, is pretty good value. We've tried the mixed plate starter, stuffed olives, smoked salmon salad and one or two other dishes and they were all decent and good value. It's a good place to sit outside and people watch and dog friendly at the outside tables. Works for me
5
I can't speak highly enough about this place -our food was great (cooked well and plenty of it) drinks prices are on par with other places we ate at and the service was brilliant -the staff we there if needed and they kept out of the way if notWould recommen
2
Been at Hannibal two times this year and both times they added items not ordered at the bill. Sent the owner an e-mail and got following answer back."I check with my staff and I can assure you it was a genuine mistake. They told me that they apologies and took the drinks off your bill. It was an unlucky event that it happened to you twice as it usually doesn't happen. It's simply because the number of the table change, once the customer start joining the tables and some orders end up at the wrong table...however we don't charge the service charge so you don't need to tip them".I can only say, SKIP THE PLACE as I don't believe it was a mistake. 
2
We (6 of us) went to Hannibal on Saturday night. We ordered food and drinks but I'd have to recommend that you skip this. No one really liked their food and the service staff seemed completely overwhelmed (the restaurant was not full). My wine was hot - not warm - but actually hot. We actually ate there but paid the bill in a hurry and moved next door to the Wine Connection to eat again! The one positive thing is that the location is good & they sometimes show sports games, but otherwise, skip it
3
Chicken skewers comes as 1 skewer with not much on it,the James Brownburger was tasty but the bun? it came with was knife inpenetrable and was left to one side.We managed to order the drinks in time to enjoy happy hour as after that they doubled in price.My wife had a Singapore sling not too bad but cost Â£12.00 overall a slightly let down feeling particularly as we kept getting clouds of cigarette smoke wafting over us every so often.Could not honestly recommend the place as we felt it overpriced for what we received
4
There are several, large TVs hung around the walls at Hannibal, meaning you can always get a good view of F1, Premier League and other sports, whilst enjoying their excellent pizzas, and very good skewers and calamari. Hannibal is a solid, Mohammed Sultan pub/bar, with some decent food and decent value wines. Friendly and efficient staff too, except for on very big occasions, when the severe size of the crowd can overwhelm
5
We went to this restaurant for like minimum10 times a month as we life in the neighbourhood. The food selection is good and not to mention about their wines. We enjoyed their Pizza, burger, steak, tapas which is most probably the best in Asia and they have excellent quality of Italian Vignarosa wines. The price is relatively cheap and they're not charging service charge and local tax. Service was decent as we always had a good one over there
3
This is conveniently located on a corner around the Robertson Quay area, about a block up from the river. We went on a Sunday eve, when it was very quiet. Nevertheless, it was difficult to get the waiters' attention - they were too busy watching sports on the screens. Food was pretty good - especially pizza and fish - but this was let down by the service, and it was "central Singapore" prices, so we expected more
4
We ran in here for dinner (literally) due to the rain and we had not seen the menu, however a British couple said not to worry as the menu was varied and the food was very good. They were not wrong. The burger was the best burger I have ever had, obviously home made. Our whole meal was really good and we would recommend this place from the perspective of the quality of food. However the service was not great. It was not that it was slow service, but the staff looked miserable and did not engage with you much. Did not spoil our meal though as the atmosphere in the restaurant/bar was good. (we had a 2.5 year old with us and they had plenty of high chairs.) it was reasonably priced and in line with the other local restaurants. We will definitely go back and will just ignore the fact that the staff were miserable.
