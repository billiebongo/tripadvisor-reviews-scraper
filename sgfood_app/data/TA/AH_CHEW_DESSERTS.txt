The desert still taste good but it used to be better. The Mango pomelo sago(杨枝甘露) is diluted and ice are added to it. I went during off peak timing and didn't wait long foe the seats which is a bonus.
5
the best local dessert in town. Try as much as you can. The taste is fresh, not too much sugar. However, waiting for ages to get a table.
3
Came here for dessert today after lunch nearby and opted for the mango pomelo which is my usual choice here. All quite good and efficient service. Happy to visit again.
5
I counted 64 types of desserts in the menu. I ordered the number 4 - Aloe Vera strawberry in honey water and lime. Amazingly good. There are some options of durian desserts too if you like it. It is worth to have a try.
4
A good place to go after meal. Tried their 榴莲西米露. It's real durian and very enrich. Thumbs up. I love their Steamed Egg With Ginger Juice too. The texture is smooth, nice mixed of egg and ginger.
4
Wide variety of dessert. Spoilt for choice. Comes in small or large size. If you mix dessert, automatically is large size. Taste wise, above average. Love the ambience!
4
Nice place to have desserts with family and friends . Open till late if I am not mistaken 12am . Dessert choices with wide variety .
5
The set up of the restaurant and the furniture are nostalgic of old time Singapore. The desserts include durian mango sago, lemon grass jelly with mixed fruit and lots of other yummy combinations, with hot or cold offerings as well. You can also add ice cream to pretty much anything! Chope a table, write your order and pay outside
4
This place serves excellent Hong Kongese style dessert! Highly recommend Durian Mango sago with pomelo add mango ice cream! The sago itself goes for S$5.80, and adding one scoop of ice cream goes extra S$1.2, so for S$7 (about US$5-6), you get yourself a bowl of refreshing fruity sago! Food is 5 stars!The service is terrible here! The person who seated me was just mad for no reason. I informed him that I was just one person, and he grabbed my arm and “dragged” me to the other seating area, telling me to sit at a specific spot. It is ok to just tell me that I need to sit at X table; there is no need to drag me there. Overall, good food, but the service is just terrible!
1
Food's ok but their seating arrangement and requirement is ridiculous! If they want to dictate where people seat, they should form a queue outside and serve the customers in instead of letting free entry. Being business conscious, the seating is arrange to the max. Even though business is not peak, they insist to squeeze our group of 3 to the side tables where almost all the Customers are seated when the round tables are marked reserved. Understand the rationale but the approach is rather silly when it's not so peak.Anyway, there're other dessert shops around where you can seat comfortably
5
I looooove Ah Chew desserts! Every time I take my friends there. My most favorite dessert in Ah Chew is Mango-Durian sago!
***Tip: Even tho they open till midnight, most of desserts will be sold out if you go late at night.
4
Refreshing desserts for a hot day and warm desserts for a rainy day. Many choices available too. But prices is a little steep maybe due to the location
4
Went here at 9 PM
very crowded place
I order a birdnest with red dates soup
And friends order durian mango sago with pomelo also serve with ice cream
I love the birdnest
Good portion
Very nice feeling and taste very fresh
Reccomended!
4
If you're willing to wait, pax of 2 - 4 waiting time is lesser. Big groups have limited areas. Had Mango Sago with Mango Icecream! Really yummy and tasty.
2
This place has gone downhill over the years. More starch is added to the soup to create the consistency (lack of). You are better off walking into most shops in Chinatown for a better bowl of dessert.
4
Not too bad for the dessert, speaking for only almond paste.
Queue is quite fast and food serve fast too.
5
I tried it because my friends told me this is one of the most famous dessert places you must try in Singapore. And wow... it was really great out of my expectation.I finished 2 bowls of dessert with a full stomach. Absolutely I will come back in the future because of good taste with good price- only from 2-4$/ dessert , good view and lovely staffs.
5
This place was near our hotel and I used to see lots of people waiting to be seated all the time. I thought it was a restaurant since on that street there are many. Then, by chance, we were taken to Ah Chew by our local friends after dinner. We tried many of the desserts (we were 7 and ordered different ones). They were all delicious and very very light
2
Bought black glutinous rice and mango sago with pomelo. Cost 8.2. Queued 20 mins to get a table and another 10 mins to order. When the d3ssert arrive there was no pomelo in the sago and they realise it and promptly came back and gave the pomelo in another bowl. The sago taste weird like cough syrup. Black glutinous rice taste not much flavour compared to last time when I came here (6months). Maybe is weekend maybe is my luck maybe maybe.
4
Well, it's not my first time at Ah Chew. I still love this dessert place. Whatever I order, it tastes great! My mama had her Black Sesame Paste and I have Yam Sago, both hot. Both of us are satisfied with our desserts. But it will be good if the sago is bigger, so that I can really taste it. It's just my own taste, no offense ☺️ Also, another thing that I must mention is that the staff are always polite and willing to assist!
4
We went there at around 4-5pm and we got the seat easily. We had 4 desserts, i had the pekkoe beancurd skin soup n it's not special. We love their durian dessert. The best one is durian with red bean and ice cream
5
After months i came back and the place still not disappoint. Fast and tasty. Many choices and decently priced. To me it feels authentic and the local interest seem to agree as well. Give it a try i doubt you will be disappointed.
4
I tried here 3 times if i am not mistaken. I like their durian desserts. I have also tried the steamed milk pudding dessert. It was nice but my favourite is still the durian dessert.This branch is near to bugis station.
4
Nice desserts with large varieties to choose from. The Q is long at times, but the serving is quite fast! The sitting capacity isn't too much. Overall the experience is good!
4
So, my hotel very near from ah chew,, then at our last day we finally try it,, it is very recomended,, alot of local people and tourist comin there.. most of them choose durian sago, but me and my friend try the grass jelly... its so fresh and yummyyyy,,, must try when you at sin.. regret when we know its so yummy dessert cafe but its our last day @ sin.
5
It's like for young local come here to meet and eat. You must take in line and be patient if you want to eat here. It's very crowded and always full of table even they have a line of table outside. I ordered one durian sago and 2 dishes that I can't remember the name :)) . Because durian sago was blowing my mind, it's rich, sweet and full of durian flavour that you could ask for. The quality is going with the price ;) . 3 dishes took about $20 and I think if you just try durian sago it takes $6-7.00, it's near the bugis junction and you can ask the local to get there, it's easy to find so don't be crazy to catch a taxi. Tip: go on MRT to Bugis, go into Bugis Junction heads to Bugis Street and ask for more
5
The only downside to all of this is the fact that there is always a long queue or it is always packed with people. "Can of sardines" type situation. But anyway, my personal favourite is The Hawaiian Papaya boiled with steamed milk and it usually comes with a riceball included in the dish. Other all-time bestsellers include the likes of Mango Sago Pomelo. Absolutely heavenly. Just, brilliant. <3
4
You always find a long queue. Generally most desserts taste quite nice, my friend favourite dessert place. The drawback is there are too many people in line and it is quite hard for you to enjoy having desserts and chill for the rest of the day. Too crowded. I prefer the branch at Novena, less crowd
4
We visited this dessert on Monday, still many people and need to wait for a while before there is table. The waiter will provide a pen and paper for you to write down the order, pay at the counter and they will deliver the desserts to your table. The dessert is delivered fast, I ordered a sago with durian, the taste is good and dessert served cold. However the price for a bowl of dessert is not cheap, but nevertheless there is still many people, highly recommended to try
4
I was around bugis shopping area and it was really hot. My friend and I loves durian a lot but we want it cool. Ah chew came to my mind. It is located at a street full of korean bbq and other eateries. Ah chew is a dessert shop with a olden chinese or nyonya concept. Marbled tables, wooden seats and oriental ornaments. The place is really small but beware, at peak hours, you might expect realllllyyyy long que!! 20-30mins wait. Lucky we came at non-peak and got us a nice indoor seat. The crews are courteous and are willing to recommend you their specialty or suit your preference. You have to write down your order in the chit and que at the cashier to place your order. Their cold desserts tend to be a little bit icy hence diminishing the taste. Warm desserts are excellent! Like their sesame balls. Check the out
5
Wow! Delicious, delicious deserts! I particularly loved the mochi and the durian sago. Something that I will definitely go back for if I do travel to Singapore again. Yum!!
4
Came back here after lunch nearby to again have the mango sago with pomelo. Very tasty as usual, and with efficient service. Not too busy at lunchtime.
5
A great place for desserts. Very near to Bugis MRT. Kopitiam style restaurant. Very wide selection of fruits, ice creams & desserts. Price very reasonable. Very good service. Walking distance to many malls & food courts nearby. Money's worth.
5
I went with some friends and ended up choosing durian sago bcs my big love for durian. That was damn awesome. I mean, it was quite pricey but the taste was worth the price!! Recommended!
4
Went last night with friends from Shanghai and Beijing! Long queue as expected, but quite fast. Crew was helpful and gave us nice spot to sit. Polite and informative! Nice dessert after all!
5
I had a chance to get there once in my tour but it's absolutely good. I think the signature is durian sago it has durian topping and below that is a mixture of durian I don't know how to call it, it's soft and cold and full of durian flavor. You have to get there early to not to wait for too long to have a table and order. They always full of table and the people want to eat there must wait in line until someone in the restaurant go out. This place isn't known by the tourist as the local eats there so much and it likes the local place you can not know if you don't search in local website or have a friend there to show you. It's worth the time you waiting so don't stop by when you're hurry. The dish that you should call is end with the word ''sago''. It's about $3 / dish or more I don't remember clearly but I think it's the place that you must come to know the atmosphere of sing by night and get to know the sing people lifestyle
4
But it's not really their fault, you see.The place is packed with loads of customers at any one point in time and servers can seem brusque and rushed.Just make sure you stay out of their way.Had the white fungus papaya dessert. Loved it as it wasn't sickly sweet. Will return
3
This is out go to place for desserts if we are in the Bugis area.You place your order at the counter, pay and within minutes you are in dessert heaven. We usually have the mango sago and the honeydew sago. The mango is slightly better as the taste is stronger. If you want something hot, try the steamed egg dishes. They have ample seating, having taken over the shop space next door

@TheKuoKnowsMany Chinese restaurants outside of Asia are not especially renowned for their desserts. Lychees and Ice cream, anyone? But proper Chinese desserts, whilst apparently simple in appearance, can be both delicious and digestive after a heavy meal.Ah Chew, which is one of a few dessert parlours that pepper the Bugis area, is a great proponent of Chinese puddings.It serves primarily traditional Chinese sweets such as red bean porridge and almond jelly. But look out for desserts with a local twist - those with a dollop of durian. Fabulous!My favourite is green bean soup, sans durian. It is supposed to assist digestion and is also meant to be cooling, even when it is served hot!Be prepared to wait, though, if you should visit Ah Chew's after an evening meal in one of the nearby restaurants in Bugis. It is a popular destination, for good reasons. It is not expensive, it is air-conditioned and it's a great way to round off an evening
5
I got there around 9 and there was aline waiting to be seated. Lots of people but super effucient and fast (and friendly) staff and serving. The menu is large and from vegan to vegetarian you can choose easily. For me it is different kind of dessert so it was magical to take a step into these kind of South East Asian dishes. Mango, durian, sesame, rice etc... Highly recommend it. Take your friend and order a lot so you can playaround with them. ;)
5
Let me simplify: the food is delicious. That's literally all I need to say about this place. Visited summer last year, great service, was served fast and the location isn't bad either. Highly recommend.
4
The Mango Sago dessert at Ah Chew Desserts is superb! It's not too sweet and has pieces of mango in it, providing much needed relief on a hot day!
4
We had a hot pot for dinner and wanted to cool down. Well this place did it. Very popular you might have to wait but the dessert was spot on. Cool and refreshing and fresh. Reasonably priced. Highly recommend.
4
Ah Chew Dessert can be accessed by Bugis MRT. 2 minutes walk from MRT station. Slight queue expected.
Nice tasty smooth hot and cold desserts. Many choices to choose.
Enjoyed. Will visit again.
1
Ordered the Steamed Milk Egg White with Ginger Juice. The juice was stale and highlighted to manager. No apology was extended and even argued that it was supposed to taste like that.
It was 2.30pm and they were not even busy.
5
I order Mango Sago and durian without pomelo due to its bitter every time I come, it is definitely my favourite one. I show this dessert restaurant to my parents when they visited singapore. they seem excited too.
5
We came at about 7pm and have to wait a while to be seated as there were few people waiting. We ordered Durian Mango Sago at s$5.30 each. The best mango sago desert ever especially for durians lovers like me. Highly recommended.
2
Along the whole stretch, there are 3 dessert stores selling local style desserts. Yet this one in the middle of the row of shophouses, usually is most popular. It occupied 2 shop units.It was a Sunday afternoon, yet the place was packed and one had to queue up to wait for a table. About 10 minutes, we were showed to a table in front of the counter at the air con area.Worn out menu framed the table top. The outlet was decorated in a traditional chinese style, with traditional chinese red wood furniture around.Order was taken at the counter with payment together. Food was later served to the table. So remember to take note of table number before ordering.Mango Sago with Pomelo 杨枝甘露 ($4.50)Cooling down with a bowl of this. The standard seem to have dropped a lot. While refreshing, the taste was rather watered down. The ice was in little cubes, not shaved ice. Could not taste puree mango in the water. It tasted more like mango flavouring with evaporated milk. The only saving grace was the juicy sweet mango cubes.Gingko, barley, and bean curd skin soup ($3) in cold versionMy partner who was having it. remarked that it smelt a bit off and had rather hard gingko nuts (felt like bought off the shelves type).Maybe business getting too good these days
3
After all the hype, I arrived with two other friends and we ordered:1) Green beans with seaweed (with add rice balls)2) Black glutinous rice3) Water chestnut with steamed milkThey were all very mediocre. The green beans was completely watery and devoid of any flavor (other than sweet), and black rice came with coconut milk that again tasted like nothing. No fragrance at all. The water chestnut seemed a step above that, but it was nothing to write home about
3
This little Chinese dessert shop is often really busy in the evenings. We decide to give it a go being in the area just around 7pm (no crowds yet).What we had was fine but nothing close to the truly authentic family run Chinese desserts shops you only find in Malaysia these days. We ordered the almond soup (milky smooth almond milk that is sweetened and served cold) and the durian sago dessert (durian cream + dollop of durian pulp + sago pearls). Prices are reflective of Singapore being an expensive city
5
expect long queues on weeknights and weekend. This is one of the best place to have mango or durian pomelo desserts.
4
Typically Asian style busy restaurant with a short wait to get in. Great authentic food taste experience. Fast service and definitely worth adding to your night out for the local experience.
5
Went with business associates for a great dessert. Best ice cream in the area. Be prepared for a wait for a seat. You can take it to go if you do not want the wait.
4
Came here for some dessert after lunch today. Extensive selection to choose from. I opted for the mango sago with pomelo which was really very good. My companion chose an egg based dessert which was also apparently quite good. Worth a visit.
5
Best mango sago ever. A must- visit place whenever I come to Singapore. Other desserts are excellent too , so it really depends on your own preference on which kind of desserts you would like. My recommendations are: mango sago ( add durian if you like), vanila ice cream with red beans
4
yes it is packed. But its worth the wait. One of the best dessert huts around. The durian sago is the best ever. If you are a durian lover go for it! you will not regret! I have tasted a few other desserts from the menu and all of them so far in my opinion are very good. It gets congested and noisy but generally the atmosphere is good
5
My favourite menu in achew is everything with durian, the durian is sweet (but not too sweet) and taste greatso many people and we have to queue before get a seat, it has indoor and outdoor seating placeworth visit if you are planning on budget travel in singapor
5
This is one of the few dessert shop that can serve quality ice cream mango dessert pudding that is close to the best standard in Hong Kong. Yummy but expensive. Hmm.. come here not for the service I guess as you have to order from the cashier. Worth while pop by if you have craving for ice dessert. They do serve hot dessert too.Enjo
1
Bad attitude from the staff at service counter. Tried to order hot sesame paste and was told it was out of stock by said staff.So tried to order hot almond paste and was told all hot dessert out of stock by the staff w an increasingly inpatient attitude.Funny thing is when i asked the manager later, all hot desserts are available, never out of stock. Suggest manager talk to talk to find out what his problem
4
We've eaten at both this location and the outlet at Novena over the years. For hot desserts like peanut paste, this place is wonderful. The paste is served nice and hot, but very smooth and not overly sweet. I think it's the best in Singapore. But when you need a cold dessert, I think their selection is quite limited particularly if, like me, you don't care for durian
4
One of the the best place to go if you want to escape Singapore's heat, everything from their menu is must try.
4
Just before 1500h was slightly better.
Seems like people like to come at 15ooh.
Love coming for their rock sugar white fugus papaya with almond.
4
You ordered your dessert, sit and eat, then leave right away. Chair and table are tiny, not a friendly place for big size people. And expect long queue in peak hour. But their desert is excellent so its worth the pain.
4
Cool place, nice ambiance, lots of desserts to choose from. Must try to satisfy.
Overall this place is great for those who love sweets.
4
It's a must visit dessert shop in town! There were so many choices and variations of desserts that there will definitely be one to suit your taste!! Queuing up in a little while, and you will be seated. Customers turnaround is fast and the service is good. Cashier is friendly and wiling to recommend desserts.Prices are reasonable. Worth another visits
5
This is one of my must-vistits in Singapore! By far the best Sago desserts in town! My favorite is the watermelon sago because it's super refreshing, but I guess the bestseller is the mango pomelo sago! If you're not looking for fruity things then go for the red bean dessert! Yummy! The warm almond soup is very good as well, but for me it's more like a meal not a dessert - very filling! If you enjoy Durian, you should definitely go. They have a big Durian dessert selection and only use fresh Durian. Nothing for me, but yeah... if you're a fan. I saw people coming only for this! So, I guess it must be good as well! Yes, it happens that I miss Singapore because of Ah Chew...
5
Craving for durian by-products or something cold in this hot, high rise concrete jungles? Get you a bowl of fine desserts at Ah Chew and I bet you won't be disappointed! My personal recommendation is still the authentic durian dessert that served with original durian flesh in the well mixed sago + durian source.
5
It's really make you addicted. First we came with our family. We tried mango sago and durian sago. Then we ended up came again the next day and the day after. So 3 days in row. We love the durian sago. The place is always crowded and long Q. Worth a try.
4
The place is very cramped and it can quite a torture if you are of big sized. You might also have to wait for a while for your turn as it is difficult to tell when is their peak hours. Most of their desserts are quite tasty but it is not the place for you to relax and chit chat with your friends. So the best thing to do is enjoy the desserts when you are there and leave once you have finished so that other can have their turns. Feel free to experiment with different kind of combinations. Have fun
4
Head down after work to give it a try for their desserts. Although its full house yet still am willing to wait. We waited about 5-10 mins for a table. Upon looking at their menu am totally spoit for choices. Too many choices to choose from the menu. Name it all you want cold or hot dessert they have it. Basically its a thirst quencher for a hot day. And if its raining you can try for their hot dessert instead. But if you were to come late some choices might be sold out. They even provide deliveries to some places. The place lil cramp yet still the ambience like those kampung time. Its great. Dessert was perfect. I swear i felt like trying all the dessert. Not too pricey too. Affordable.
5
My dining companion pre-ordered our dessert before a dinner a few doors along.
We waited a minute or two for our dishes when we arrived back after dinner.
Our Durian ice cream proved a winner - refreshing and cool.
5
My friend introduced me this awesome dessert place. I always come here at least once a month to enjoy their dessert. If you come at night, you have to be ready to queue!!
5
Found this dessert place wonderful, so much choice and either hot or cold desserts available, would recommend it to anyone.
3
We were told this was a fab place for dessert so decided to give it a try. Found it in a side street, you had to queue to get a seat at a dirty table, chose your dish, queue to pay and then it turned up. On the plus side it was authentic basic local desserts but the quality wasn't brilliant, place was a bit dirty and really all in it was nothing specia
3
Ah Chew has a huge menu of chinese/local desserts which can be daunting. Unless you have a favourite in mind, it's good to ask the person taking the order.I was there with a friend last week at night.First you have to get a table number, then place your order and pay at the same time at the cashier. Aside from a large menu with tiny squares of photo of all the dessert available, they also have a poster of 4-5 of their house specials.I had the mango sago which was delightful, I could taste the mango bits and the soup was not too sweet. The other item I ordered was the hiasma with dates (served hot). It was a much more expensive dish. I thought it was not well prepared as it seemed that the dates were just added in before serving. Aren't they supposed be to boiled till soft and their flavour infused into the soup? So it was a thumbs down for me. My friend ordered a lycee dessert with a scoop blueberry ice-cream, it came with red bean ice-cream instead - not good.Very tiny rosewood-like tables take up almost very inch of the place, the max it can hold are 4 dessert bowls. We sat shoulders touching shoulders with the people from the next table. You couldn't really have a conversation without invading into their space unless you whispered.I was there previously with my family (7-8 paxs), we had a large round table in a corner - that was much better. There is only 1 large table. They do have another lot next door which have booths for 4 diners
4
I was with friends at this place a couple days ago to have dessert. The menu was quite extensive and there is hot or cold desserts at max $5 a bowl. There would be a long queues on lunch or dinner time. But even in anytime this place is seems always busy. Good choice of desserts for a change. They have chicken and curry puffs as well for $2 each.
4
Came here with my date, she had the mango Sago and I had the watermelon Sago. Both were undeniably good and with the price that's tough to beat! The staff were also friendly and pleasant. Parking might be a pain during the late hours so Park down the street or use the next street for parking as there are more lots available then.
5
We were there for steamboat buffet but the time was still early, so we decided to have some dessert before our dinner. As my Singaporean friend told us, this place have very nice dessert and it's a popular place for locals or tourists. The pricing are reasonable, as I ordered a Mango Sago just cost $3.50. Highly recommend
3
Been visiting this place for dessert for years. Convenient location as its walking distance from the MRT station. Surrounded by hotpot restaurants & cafe, Ah Chew is perfect for after lunch/dinner. Be prepared to queue though. Wide variety of selection to choose from. Hot & Cold, ice cream, pudding or shave ic
5
I came here with my daughter. I only order 1 mango sagoo. It was good and refreshing. When we finished it and want to out from the store, the owner (I assumed) gave me 1 cone strawberry ice cream. When i said i didnt order it, he said it was for my daughter and its free. What a good man. Thank you
5
Had their durian sago which was awesome! We also tried their mango sago and hong kong red bean ice which are great as well. Be there during non-peak hours so you don't have to wait for tables.
4
Located near to the MRT station in Bugis area. Serve lot kind of ice dessert. You should try it. Open until midnight.
5
All the great Dessert you would think of in Singapore. The Quality was Great. the Ordering Process was simple and easy. Some challenge in getting seating, but people move in and out pretty fast.
5
My friend could not remember the placed but we managed to joggle his memory and finally found the original place, address: 1 Liang Seah Street #01-11, Singapore. Try the Mango Sago with Pomelo.
4
My friend took my sister and I to Ah Chew desserts late on a Monday night. We had the chinese herbal jelly, a top recommendation from our friend. I had been super reluctant to try it, but it was refreshing and rather sweet! The mango, sago and ice cream is a favourite with those who aren't a big fan of Asian/ Taiwanese desserts - another good one was the grass jelly with fresh mango. Best of all, the desserts are all super cheap (less than $5 a pop!). A nice local dessert place to try out!
4
I stumbled upon this dessert place at Liang Seah street and tried the red bean paste. It was just wonderful. The red bean taste is just sufficiant - not over powering. The serving was large which makes it good value for money. Service was very efficient. Go early to avoid long queue. A wonderful discovery!
3
We are a group of eight,went there for dessert after a heavy dinner. The old man that allocate the seat was very nice to find us a big table for our group. We had peanut paste, mango & sago, egg with ginger juice & papaya with white fungus. Peanut paste was thick & very sweet. Group have mixed comments, some like it coz can taste the aroma of the peanut, I find it's too thick that it's not smooth to the throat. The mango sago was mediocre, egg with ginger juice, the ginger taste too overpowering g and the eggs not smooth but very watery not silky
5
This delicious place is just across the street from our hotel. We ventured across the street to it this afternoon rather than venture to the Bugis side. It was not busy since it was afternoon. We ordered mango sago since we wanted to try what all the reviews said to do. Those little sago are so cute in the bowl. It is like mango soup cold with chunks of mango and ice and little clear pellets about the size of beads in a bean bag chair. They also seek I've cream for about half the price of Baskin Robbin over in Bugis. Like I said, its a good thing we discovered it today and are going home tomorrow or I would come over here every day to try something! 
4
Came here with friends a few times. In a street just off from bugis junction mall.Ask for directions if you get lost. The street has other restaurants and cafes tooThe desserts are the traditional Chinese desserts. Very refreshing especially in the afternoon after you have been walking around in the malls
5
We first tried Ah Chew in Novena, and it was so delicious that we went again to Ah Chew in Bugis! We ordered the Durian Sago and Mango Sago. Both are to die for! The mango is a perfect combination of sweet and a just a little sour. So refreshing
5
Long queuing, but worth it , every time i came to singapore , i came here ....small place ,hope they can open in singapore mall
4
A friend from Singapore recommended this place. There is so much variety. There are plenty of options and it is well priced.
4
Best in town, prepare to queue up during peak hours, usually 8 - 10PM. Vast number of dessert choices. Strongly recommend the durian sago and also the peanut paste dessert!
4
We hit the joint on the way back to our hotel.
Nice desserts with fast service. We tried the popular mango sago pomelo and the durian one.
No wonder the locals praised this place. Good place to hangout after shopping in bugis
5
We went there and there was a que. My boyfriend recommended this place have a very good local dessert. At first i didn't know what to order because they have a wide selection.But our chosen one was very good! Wanted to try more but we are full already.We had mango sago, strawberry with honey and lime and the lemongrass with jelly
1
5 of us patronised the outlet at Goldhill Shopping Centre on a Sunday.4 of us was promptly served. Me... I sat waiting for my dessert.I sat facing the counter. The guy, who tooked all our 5 orders, and who seemed to be in charge of the shift, stood at the counter, facing me, doing pretty much nothing else. I brought my two arms up ... with my both palms up.. to say "whats happening with my order"?The guy seemed to have understood. He said, without shifting his position, "Its coming from Hong Kong". "Shenzhen, maybe!" I remarked. The guy didn't move an inch. He just yelled from his counter to my table which is at least 3 covers away!About 30 seconds later, one wait staff, come out from the dessert preparation counter, to deliver an order - but not to me.A further 30 seconds, a lady in white came to see the guy behind the counter. He seemed to hand over a set of uniforms to the lady. In full view before me, nothing seems to be done in servicing my order.I signalled to a passing waitress that I no longer want my dessert. 'Cancel my order'.By this time, my 4 companions have very nearly finished their desserts! This waitress reported to the counter. Another waitress came to ask why. I said I have been waiting far to long, everyones finished their dessert, I want to cancel my order. This waitress went back to the counter and returned, saying the dessert that I ordered is being prepared.All this while, the guy who took my order, the same guy who stood rooted like a statue at the counter, did nothing.Question. If my order was being prepared, why didn't the first waitress say so?Question. Shouldn't the guy, who has been doing nothing except prop himself up on the counter, at least come to attend to me since he was the one who took all the orders?Question. The guy should at least approach me at my table to address my concerns.. instead of yelling across the entire Silk Road!This must surely be one place where a waiter is a staff who waits .... with you.Soon... such an outlet will get their just desserts... and yes, their day will come

The first thing you'll notice when you sit down at this little dessert place is the immense variety of Chinese desserts available, served hot or cold. I tried the Milk Egg White Custard ($3.30) and the Mango Sago ($3+) with Ice cream (+$1). While the Egg White dessert was not spectacular (wouldn't order it again if I returned), the Mango Sago was so delicious. It was verging on the too-sweet end, but was still very refreshing and had great flavour. There were large chunks of sweet, fresh mango, which isn't often found in this dessert. Overall, I'd definitely return for the Mango Sago and to try more desserts they have on offer

Tried the durian sago pudding here. It was SGD 6 per bowl. Very creamy and full of durian flavour. It was delicious if not a bit sinful. We went about 9 pm and had to wait a bit for a place. It was crowded. I'd recommend it for durian lovers.

Always a nice way to round off a meal, the desserts never fail to satisfy.The wide choices and the buzzy atmosphere always make this a joy to come back to. Day time is better as the place hasn't become heaving with people yet. And a cool dessert is a good solution to the tropical heat. Strongly recommend the mango, pomelo and ice

We walked along Liang Seah Street and saw a long line around 10 pm. We decided to check it out, and it was worth it! We asked the owner what the 2 most popular desserts were, and he recommended mango with sago, and black glutinous rice with ice cream. Both desserts were very good. The indoor ambience of the restaurant is nice - you sit on wooden stools with inlays - and the desserts are served in ceramic bowls. The restaurant also has outdoor seating. Highly recommended

We tried their different kinds of desserts and everything was good. Be warned thought that you need to queue up for sometime before you can have seats. Worth trying.

It's one of the original and still doing a roaring trade with the young crowd. But the curt attitude of the boss and his crew erodes a nice experience. Still one of the best primarily due to lack of competition.

Good dessert for relaxing after whole day activities. I always having their Grassjelly mixed watermelon. Affordable price with good taste. They got many choices of dessert to try. They only open from afternoon til 11pm or 1am on weekend. Must try !

It is one our favorite place to come to have hot or cold desserts. Must try Mango Sago with fresh ingredients. Great and always packed but worth to queue. Never missed to come here in every trip to singapore.

This is one of the places I would bring my friends who are visiting Singapore. A friend brought me here some time ago, and I fell in love with their Mango Sago dessert since then. Friends who have been here will always ask that we visit this place again. If you love mango, do try their Mango sago. It is probably one of their most popular item on the menu. They have a variety of hot desserts as well. Some of my friends like their hot dessert such as sesame and almond paste.Do note that this place can get pretty crowded after 7pm, so it may be better to pop by during their off-peak hours if you don't like queuing

Best time to eat here is at night and have your hot / cold dessert. The seats are usually all taken as it is very crowded at night especially week end, so when you order your dessert at the cashier, ask your friend to search for an empty seat or wait for some customers to check ou

One of my favourite desert haunt in Spore for a typical bowl of hot steaming desert chinese style. I've recommended many people there and so far everyone revisits frequently. Tip - don't go too late, as the hot options will be sold out by then. Need to highlight the Mango/Pomelo chilled sago desert is one of the bes
