Had a dinner here with friends. The service was good, like the ambience too. I ordered the steak Mex bowl which was fresh and good. Overall, a pleasant dinner.
5
this place offers all types of cuisine including options for vegans...centrally located in Clarke Quay..it holds its crowd well among the food options
2
Very poor experience here. Family of four for dinner. The service was slow and very poor. The food was very bad. Skip this place and go elsewhere.

We were looking for some Amercian/ Mexican food and bumped in to Chilli's. Chilli's can never go wrong and that was our experience in India.But when we went there the Worst part of the restaurant was SERVICE!!We were literally non existent .In a group of three, the third one got his order when the first 2 finished their meal. Food is good but being in Singapore, I was expecting a Class apart Service and it was disappointing.Location is nice next to river front but Customer Service Sucks!!
1
Having been found a table fairly quickly, we were ready to order within 10 minutes, but no one came to take our order. After 20 minutes wait, we gave up and left. It was not as though the place was heaving, as there were plenty of spare tables, just apparently unenthusiastic staf
3
Being at the mall I decided to try this place. That wasn't so smart at it appeared. The service wasn't bad when I arrived but the place was almost empty then. When people started to come in the employees seems overwhelmed. I ordered some Mexican food and although I can't say it was untasty the portions were small for the price I paid. The restaurant tries to be connected and they have tablets for the costumer to order, but when I placed an extra item in my ordered it never arrived and I had to call a waiter so I can have it. The excuse was that the order ''didn't pass through''. In conclusion I cannot recommend this place there are many other places in the area with better food at these prices

This is not a fine dining place, but some of their mains and siders are delicious, good seasoning, coriander and avocados (my two favorite ingredients) in many of their dishes ! Can be a bit frustrating when it comes to how fast siders and mains arrive, especially when they arrive together. Also a bit disappointed that my dessert was obviously microwaved (the salted caramel cake), because shows in the texture... Nonetheless, I love to come here once in a while 
4
Chili's in Clarke Quay area is just outside the mall and the Clarke Quay MRT station. The menu is worth a try and the servings (for the price) is very huge. Have rib eye steaks and bacon ranch quesadillas makes more than enough for two persons. Baby back ribs and the Fajitas are also a must try
5
My husband and I would like to thank Katherine, one of the restaurant managers in Chili's The Central branch.We wandered in to Chili's at 3.30pm to have our usual Christmas meal tradition. Unfortunately we were not aware of them closing for an hour from 4pm for the staff to have a meal (I'm assuming, I was not listening too closely to their explanation). But Katherine graciously accepted us and seated us and took our orders, she didn't turn us away even though they had every right to have a meal to prepare for the dinner rush.Thank you Katherine for making our Christmas meal at Chili's possible. With this lovely experience we look forward to seeing you on our visit!Oh btw the food is awesome. It was my first time ordering the double shrimp fajitas, and looks like it will always be the dish I'll order when we visit Chili's
4
Wherever I travel around the world, this ones a constant! no doubt, it is heavy on the pocket but the taste is always sublime. never regret going here. Moreover, paired with the overall nightlife vibes of clarke quay, dinner here proved to be quite the treat
5
We visited tonight for dinner and the food was delicious!!!! We ordered a half rack of ribs, quesadillas, entree with 3 choices and chicken santa fe salad. I wish we had something like this back in Australia.
5
The pork rib here is amazingly good and very tasty. The portion is generous but the price is not cheal either. Recommend to come in big group as you can never finish one portion alone.
4
Value for money to using eatigo apps to make reservation.The BBQ Ribs and platter are yummy.will be back again shortly.
2
I had soup of the day and Oldtimer burger for my lunch. Very attentive staffs and cozy environment. The foods are average even though they are pricey, feel like not worth for the money.
4
Decent western food as can be expected from Chilis, if you are looking for familiarity in Western food this is the place. Our food was tasty and came pretty quickly, although the dessert got a little delayed, and getting staff attention was sometimes challenging. Cocktails were great too. Prices are in line with what to expect for Singapore, so definitely higher than the immediate region countries. Ambience is a typical Chilis - well-lit, comfortable seating
2
It’s a while since I have been in a Chilis so I had forgotten how there is always a disconnect between the menu pictures / descriptions and the food that arrives. This branch was no exception. For crispy chicken you get soggy, cooked some time ago chicken. The sweet corn has been soaking in hot water for hours and they can’t even be bothered to heat up the home style fries that have been lying around the kitchen for a while. Avoid
4
Busy as expected on a weekend night, but we got booked in advance and got a booth. The food was delicious as expected, however the service here was very slow and there were some problems. But we weren't in a rush so it wasn't a problem for us. Overall it was a good experience
1
We went there as we know chilis reputation back in oz was good. Totally dumbfounded by this place. Ordered children's fish and chips with a side of corn (as it states word for word on the menu) only to be served fish and corn with no chips. Even though the waiter said "here is your fish and chips". After querying where are the chips, I was initially advised the option is only fish or chips with a side?!?! We then got an apology form the manager (who advised us the wording on the menu is wrong after a short argument on the wording) and reluctantly gave us chips as well, only for us to be further upset as they were stone cold when we received them.Terrible service, bland mexican tacos and chili as well as the dodgy menu wording. Gordon Ramsay needs to visit this place. Our waitress was the only shining light who was very apologetic of the whole situation.
4
Visited this place for dinner with friends in Clark Quay. Ambience is nice and the place not so crowded. The staffs are friendly and attends to your needs at all times. The food we order was great but some of the condiments were not replenish. We will be back again for sure
2
Went for lunch. Place was basically empty bar three other tables. Waiter sat us next to two other tables that were occupied, one with a very sick gentleman. Being pregnant we asked to move away from the sick man and to a normal table and chairs as the booths are super uncomfortable. So they sat us at a table and chairs next to the only other occupied table. Why seat customers so close together? Weird. The food is so expensive for what it is. Basically you are paying for the name. The waitress could barely speak english and when we asked her various things about the menu she just could not answer and looked at us like we were aliens. We ordered the bottomless soft drinks but were never able to get a top up so that whole thing is a rip off. When the food was delivered we never saw another waitress again. Food was ok, nothing to write home about. Service was so slow and when trying to pay the 3 waitresses were standing around chatting and we had to go over to them to ask them if we could pay and then they made us wait while they finished their conversation and the only male waiter came from across the restaurant and ended up helping us. Will never come back. Was awful.
4
We had sampler appetizers and then a good varity from salad, soup, ribs, mexican food. Service was friendly, quick and the food tasted good. Free refills on sodas.
4
Very pleasant staff, bit pricey for the type of menu but the portion sizes were really big so it all balanced out
2
Location is excellent, seating outside at Singapur river possible. Service is quite slow, so bring time. Between dessert and cash-out has been 30 mins, and I had to walk to the cash-desk to get my invoice. Very unorganized. For example, had Fajitas. What came furst has been the hot piece of it. 2 mins later the Fajitas, 2 mns later knife/fork, two mins later the guacamole/cheese/tomatoes. Until then, the rest has been cold. ...worst thing: They did not book 2 drinks to the kids menu, but cashed to get it from us in addition. Once reclaiming, they said that we ordered these separately, what is stupid as they first asked us for the drinks, then for the menu decision. At the end, they removed it from the invoice. 10% Service charge on top, so don't double-tip. Quality lower than Chili's average: Kids chicken has been overdone, dried-out. Fajita bell-peper has not been done well enough. French fries excellent
3
There are lots of options on the menu so you should find something to suit your taste. Three meals cost us around 80 dollars. The only problem is service is slow and when you are seen to its hurried. When asked for bill the bill book was given but waiter disappeared. I went up to another waiter to pay and he gave me the most dirty look. Did I commit some kind of faux pas by trying to get my bill paid by another server? Not sure
4
Environment is clean and cosy, food portions are generous although some items are better than others. The deserts like Skillet Chocolate Chip CookieLearn about Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie and Molten Chocolate Cake are excellent and great for sharing with friends even after a full meal
1
We have been to Chilis many times in various cities and this is without doubt the worst experience. Slow service, very disorganised, maybe short staffed? The"food" was microwaved to within an inch of its life. Then the bill was presented and it was way out. Maybe $25 over. We asked for it to be recalculated and again it was wrong but closer to being correct. We couldn't stay any longer so paid and left. Fast. Never to go bac

The first we visited this place was in 2014 (first time in Singapore from Texas) and we loved their food and services then. So to have a special father's day we decided to spend our lunch in Chilli's Clark Quay our experience was very disappointing that we resolve never to go to any chilli's in Singapore. You can't find the hostess at her station so we have to seat ourselves, it took a long time for them to get our order and forever to bring it on our table. By the time we had our appetizer the cheese already melted and is hard and chewey on our fries, the Cajun burger doesn't even taste Cajun~its like a boiled chicken in between buns, they didn't even care to give us napkins or utensils!! (No fork/spoon/knife) you couldn't find your servers anywhere all of them running like chicken with their heads cut off and when we finally got one to ask for napkins etc it came to us one by one! Ridiculous! and the hostess acted like we're bothering her ugh! The food and service we've received was not worth the 100 Singapore dollars we spend in this joint.
1
Extremely disappointing supper at Chilis! I have had Chilis at Tanglin before and had very pleasant experiences but at Central my visit was ruined by the extremely salty buffalo wings. We could not bring ourselves to finish the dish. Upon providing our feedback the manager told us the sauce on the chicken was straight from a packet and implied the kitchen was not at fault. Upon reiterating, he said he understood it was salty and personally tried it many times but did nothing to compensate us but bring us some water to chug the chicken down? If the company does read this, I hope they will review the dish as I don't understand how there would be customers that appreciate the extreme saltiness. The consolation was the friendly waitress that served us.
4
We were there for weekday lunch, was not too crowded. Service was initially slow as there was only one staff. As more staff started to work, service was faster and better. They were quick to respond to our extra bbq sauce and mayonnaise request. My boy had Southern Smokehouse Burger and he loves the classic BBQ sauce. My girl had Grilled Chicken Sandwich, she says it was ok. . I had Beef Enchilada, the rice has a nice mexican flavor. Good presentation and portion. A good experience overall
4
Well situated near Clarke Quay and the business district it offers a good variety of courses. We had some american style sandwiches which were excelent. Food is served not quick and not slow, but the sound level in the busy restaurant can be a little unsettling. Prices are average and value is good
5
Awesome location. Awesome food. Awesome interiors. Loved the cheese Nachos and Pork. Beer along with Chili food is just a way to enjoy Clarke Quay.
2
We ate here one afternoon there was only three other tables and the service was just so bad. When I saw the reviews about the service I didn't think it could be that bad but it really was! Our finished plates sat on our table for ages before they were cleared away and the waitress walked past them at least 5 times! Also the food is clearly microwaved, my food came out within minutes of me ordering. I know it's going to be microwaved somewhere like this but I wish they would just keep up the pretence and wait fifteen minutes.
1
Spoilt our friends birthday celebration for the rude service staff and the manager never resolve the issue.Are ok guyz? Working in service line then treat your customer like that. We purposely choose this coz we love their ribs menu. But we did the wrong move as we experience terrible service. Better go other places to eat Cant recommend to others
3
Had a hankering for US comfort food. Everything was ok but just ok, nothing outstanding. Sampler appetizer platter was ok but lack authenticity to what you'd get at a US Chili's. I suppose what to be expected in Asia for a US style bistro
5
We visited Chili's at Clarke Quay and at Sentosa Island 3 times during our stay in Singapore - it is a great option for those wanting some Western food. The tex mex bowls are amazing, as are the fajitas and the burgers. They also have some great specials on for different nights of the week and the service was fantastic. Would definitely return when we go back to Singapore
4
We wanted to have a quick drink after work on Friday night. This outlet is located close to the famed Clark Quay array, which plenty of parking options nearby. The restaurant was crowded but we were given seat quickly. The drinks and food were served promptly. We enjoyed the great Tex-mex food. The portion size was quite decent, similar to the US servings. Adequate variety of beers, wine and cocktails. Staff were friendly. We would definitely go back for our weekend eat
2
I was feeling like having a proper burger for a lunch. Walked pass a Chilis and decided to give it a go. Big mistake. Burger was plant, patty was chewy, probably from the freezer. I you are in Singapore, there are 10.000 other restaurants to go, or if you want a burger there is a Burger King next door
4
I took my family here to celebrate the birthday of my little princess. We greatly enjoyed the burgers, fajitas, free flow soft drinks, and desserts. The staff and service were excellent and attentive to us and our kids. They also have 1/2 price beers for happy hour!
3
If you goto Chilis, only bother with the original US version - food is bland, served far too fast, has little spice and little kick.Service is not especially friendly, on a busy night you are rushed through like a factory piece and all in all I left highly disappointed. Only the location, next to the river, is pleasant. But you cannot even sit outside - go instead to one of the bars down the river..
4
We have our dinner and it was full house, they attend to us immediately and get a table since there was 1 table available.They had promo for bev and we did order for long island tea, we can only taste the sweetness but its seems no alcohol at all.Its hard to get service since it was busy night and acceptable.We had the classic nachos, tasty &Good presentation.. tostada chips with salsa was too salty and we ask to change it.Full Baby back ribs was not as we expect to be served hot but it was fine since we are hungry, no time to get the attention of the staff.We are satisfied though there were unhappy matters.Over-all 4 star!Cheers

After trying different local restaurants we decided to give Chilie Clarke Quay a tray.
It's a very good location really close to the MTR (metro).
The area is fantastic... About the food... Good Enough!.
4
Visited for lunch. Grabbed the sampler pack. Very nice with a reasonable price. Good and fast service.
3
We'd just arrived and needed a burger fix. Central location and the burgers were the offer of the day. Enjoyable but I don't think I'd like to pay full price. Service is not the best. It's ok here, had better, had worse
2
We went there on a quite afternoon during the week. With us it had in the whole restaurant around 4 other guests. First we waited forever to see a waiter to get to a table. Then it took (no joke) 25 minutes and no one appeared. Ok I went to the bar and the drinks came then finally. We took order for the food. After another 30min the food came but wrong.... instead of the Texas fries we've got something different. Finally I had to pay at the bar because again no one appeared. I wonder if this place is haunted, because I have no clue why all staff always was invisible. The food if you get the right one was very good, but the service...ahheemmm Goofy could do a better job
4
Ate here NYE to grab something quick and easy before heading into Clarke Quay. Timed it perfectly as by the time we got our meal the place was packed with long queues outside. My advice, eat early if you want to avoid a wait. Food was good & service was ok considering how busy it was. Convenient location to Central mall and the MRT and a short walk to the heart of Clarke Quay with some decent bars along the way. Definitely worth considering if you're not after local specialities and just want a solid western style meal
3
Family of four lunch costs $160 but that's just western food price average here in Singapore. Kids had children's crispy chicken meals and milkshakes all of which were delicious. We had the trio of fajitas and a quesadilla. No refills offered we saw our waiter only once at food delivery and had to wait for nearly an hour to get his attention and get a dessert order in and ask for a refill. We had the chocolate laver cake x2 and again food was terrific and sizes very generous. Had service been there at all we would have rated excellent even given prices. Bar staff very accomodating allowing us to watch condensed version of NFL games we missed so at least long wait for service was mitigated. Tips for service: if you are serving hot drinks a spoon to stir in milk would be nice, if serving 2 kids drinks 2 straws instead of one would be great. Clearing dishes would be great, offers for drinks and desserts even better and then finally when we have to get your attention to get a bill actually giving a receipt when you have offered one would be great. Frustrating service but bar staff and chefs pulled the overall experience up

After a week in Singapore I had begun to miss my western food. I had walked past Chili's in Clarke Quay several times, but as a naive westerner I thought I would try all the local cuisines. Anyone who has tried this knows it never ends well. Then came Chili's to the rescue! As an Australian I feel we have a similar taste style to Americans so me and my partner went to Chili's. I can not stress how amazing the place is in Clarke Quay. First the service, just perfect. My drink was always full, the servers had great recommendations for what food to try and they really make the place light and happy with their awesome attitude. Next, the food. We tried the Texas cheese fries, the Smokehouse southern burgers and finished up with the molten chocolate cake. All the food was hot and fresh, the cheese was still melting! The burgers were soooo good and now sit on the top of my favourite burger list. Ending with the molten chocolate cake was the perfect way to end the night. Ultimately I just cannot recommend this place enough. As my first trip to a Chili's, the guys at Clarke quay definetly made the place somewhere you just have to come back too. 10/1
5
I have eaten at chili's in Australia a long time ago and it was one of my favorite restaurants to go to, and also in Malaysia and the United States. The service here was phenomenal the whole time, very welcomed on our first time in Singapore, the classic nachos with chicken and guacamole, bacon burgers cooked to perfection......only wish we left room for dessert. We will be back and going to the one at Sentosa island where we are staying..everyone needs to eat here!!!
4
As always Chili's serves great food. Been here several times and the food remains very good. They have promotions where kids eat free on specific days. It serves western food and have a good size of serving. The music during the time we where there was too loud. Other than that, everything was great! This is recommended for travellers to dine
4
Some of the beverages were really large glasses and certain platters by itself was able to feed a group of 5 females. Value for money too
1
We ordered bacon ranch quesadilla and the mixed platter appetiser (boneless chicken wing, big mouth bites and egg rolls). The quesadilla was so tough and dry when it was served to us we took a long time to chew it. The big mouth bites which was like a bite sized burger was also very dry and I couldn't finish even 2 bites even though my hubby managed to finish his share. Egg rolls were at least normal and soft. The boneless chicken was also very dry and hard. Everything was dry and hard and the only saving grace was the rice which I ate most of it for my dinner. Most of food was cold when served except for the egh rolls. Strong jaws and teeth required to finish some part of my dinner. First and last time
4
Looking for good old American style food or Mexican. Chilies is the places to be. Was nicely greeted at the entrance. but I guess the staff were a bit too occupied.food wise, was good up to my standard at least. Must try : chili fries. or anything with chil
1
I was lured into the restaurant by their lunch special. The grouchy and unfriendly waiter did not allow me to sit in the section I wanted; despite the fact that the restaurant was 95% empty. The food was lukewarm. The pulled pork was dry, the fries among the worst I ever had. After I finished the meal, the waiter asked me to settle the bill immediately. After being pampered by good service and great food in the UAE, this is by far the worst Chili's outlet I have ever been to; simply shocking
3
Tried the cheese fries as I am always crazy about cheese....but the dish turned out like a over-dried omelette lay on the potato fries rather than a cheezy-fries. The only compliment goes to the hand-crafted burger, meat is tender and nicely presented
5
This outlet has big seating area and offers excellent service perhaps because of its location. Steff were very attentive also the margaritas are a to try. Especially the frozen ones. Had the steak and prawn fargita and I got to admit, it's worth the money especially you dine on Wednesdays. Awesome food, great service. Will be back
5
The food is yummy! Better than most Mexican restaurants around. Nice city view, accessible and did I say the food was delicious! Chicken Quesadillas were delicious. Don't forget to request for crispy quesadillas. You'll be amazed how that couple of extra mins of heat take it to another level. Loved their chicken wings and bottom less chips. Their molten chocolate cake is another yummy treat. Though, the chicken and shrimp Fajitas were just ok.
4
Wow! Amazing service and amazing food. I visited a Chili's 8 years ago when I was last in Singapore and simply had to return and yes it was as awesome as I remember. The staff were very tentative even though they were run off their feet and the manager checked in with us to make sure we were enjoying our meals. The menu made it very hard to choose a meal as everything sounded delicious and I will definitely return in the future to try a few of the other dishes. Highly recommend if you like mexican, burgers, ribs or steak

We celebrated my wife's birthday at Chilli's.Even got a hot chocolate cake on the house..Great location and ambience and had loads of fun !
1
What a bad service from a well-known restaurant like Chili's, it was totally a horrifying experience I've ever encountered so far. It took half an hour for me to order the food as all of the waitresses giving us "please wait for a moment" hand gesture, which left a major bad impression to us. We eventually got to order the food after we had complained to the manager. Furthermore, the food took another 30 minutes to come and it was already a bit cold, though we couldn't be bothered anymore for another complaints. Dear Chili's please retrain your staffs to give a better customer service or else I might say this restaurant isn't recommended at all
3
I seemed to sit there for an eternity waiting for someone to take my order... You would think it was restaurant 101... take the customers order...The food was fantastic...the ribs are highly reccomended.For those on a budget... bottomless mugs of softdrink and refillable cornchips and dip... eat and drink all night for under $20sgd if that is your fanc
4
A must do in Singapore. The Clarke Quay location is similar to darling harbour in Sydney. So many good restaurants and bars to enjoy the nightlife.
4
Free wifi, refills on soft drinks, awesome chicken and chili. A place I will go lots of times. Nice atmosphere and helpful staff always!
4
Nice and pleasant place and people.. Looks like Applebee's. Good quality of food but too expensive for this style of food.. 20$ for a normal sized burger?? Ok.. At least it was tasty.
4
A group of 12 of us ordered 2 starters, 8 mains and 12 drinks for lunch. We were thorough satisfied with the portions, the taste was just right, food was freshly prepared and served warm. The staff were attentive and friendly. Would definately be returning again
1
we came here just before leaving for airportmeal was very dissapointing and we regret this being our last meal in what was a great time in the lovely Singapore.food i ordered was cold and had to be sent backi would not recommend this place to anyone who enjoys foo
4
there are many dishes to choose from.they should include more vegie starters.salads taste black.but most of the dishes were great
2
I suppose I have to blame myself for thinking that I would have good Mexican food at a Chili's in Singapore. My wife ordered a chipotle chicken bowl and it was fare. I had the chicken enchiladas, and they were bland. I asked if they had some hot sauce, but they could only offer me a jar of dried peppers were were stuck together and could not be poured out. I would not recommend Chili's in Singapore
5
My husband is a Chilli's fan since his stay in USA for some months. he was joyous to find it in Singapore so we went there for lunch during our first stay in Clark Quay area. Good location beside the river, great food and ambience. Staff is freindly and the place offers some good combos for non-vegetarians. The vegetarian options are good too. I did not try but have heard a lot about their burgers too
3
As an expat living in Indonesia for the past three years, far away from any non-fast food US chains, I really really really wanted to have an memorable experience eating at a US restaurant. Unfortunately, there are plenty of non-US chains that serve better western fair for a more reasonable price. The service was fine, the food was fine, and the environment was...fine. All in all instead of being a taste of American suburbia (i.e. a taste of home) it was simply a taste of surprisingly overpriced, average food
4
Lunchtime is simply hectic there and you may have to wait a little to be seated, but no big deal.They have quite a fair lunch deal: starter (soup or salad), a choice of main and free refill for SG14-17, exçluding taxes. Portions are generous, so you really leave satisfied!After ordering, it took ages for the drinks to get served, and in a hot and humid place like Singapore, what you crave the most for is to drink something, once you get to sit down somewhere!My friend received his salad and my soup never came, despite indications othewise of the young and fresh waiter; his main dish came and no sign of my soup. He was halfway though his main and I had had nothing on my table, so time to complaint came!Mr Viknesh, the manager, who was also helping serving tables (something that most managers wouldn't dare do in Brazil!), approached me with very sincere apologies and offered my share of lunch on the house as compensation. All very honest and caring, and a promise of much better servisse next time - wait for me gladly, Mr Viknesh, I'll be back!One suggestion: why not investing a little bit and getting some gadgets for the staff to order everything electronically, as well as hiring students just for the peak hours, one to do only drinks and cuttlery, and the other just to deal with bills, so the rest and keep moving around like crazy with orders? That would certainly minimize the complaints here. But keep up with the caring honesty, that's how you win customers, like me

Visited Clarke Quay at about 12 md, looking for lunch - most of the cafe restaurants were either closedor some just opening.The area obviously caters for evening trade.Found Chillis - ordered a salad and a nachos from the extensive menu - service exceptionaly efficent and friendly from a young waitress.Premises clean and cool.Thoroughly enjoyed our lunc

Had just arrived in Singapore and hadn't eaten for 12 hours, I had a good appetite on me when entering Chilis. I ordered their pulled pork sandwich (though it looks to me a bun) and panko crumbed squid rings. All was served pretty quickly. The pulled pork sandwich/bun was very nice and juicy, it had some crumbed item in there too, I found this odd, but it didn't overly detract from the item. The squid rings were nice, though I wasn't terribly keen on the sauce they served with it, I do prefer a more traditional sauce. Minor grumbling there, nothing that'd stop my returning to be honest.
3
Value set lunch. Comes with drink, soup or salad. Portion size is huge. I'm a big eater and I had difficulty finishing my meal of chicken quesadilla. I just wish there's more salsa to go with the meal. It was too heavy (cheesy) and the salsa helped lighten it up but there was too little salsa. On the whole it was an acceptable taste. But I think they didn't clean the grill properly cos there's abit of stale oil taste on the food. That made the quality decline quite abit. Would I be back? Maybe. If I'm really hungry and want a western meal but only for the value lunch set.
2
Very disappointed meal experience: took the family for an evening meal, left feeling ripped off. Everything filled with cheese to replace the lack of meat, kids couldn't eat the food, chips were burnt with skin still on and meals looked nothing like the menu pictures. Staff were nice and friendly but didn't make up for paying such huge prices for poor quality food. Definitely won't be returning!!
4
The food was pretty good but super slow service. The nachos was so good but didn't like the dip. Lots of choice,on food and beverages and bottomless soft drinks which is always a winner for me. Price was reasonable and an altogether pleasant dining experience which we hope to repeat
3
Decided to try dining here. Ordered our meals and we were chatting when suddenly the chat stopped. I was rather shocked the staff just placed the cutleries on the table and walked away. Not in a ''nice'' manner, on the coasters on the menus. A lady. The serving staff (didn't get his name but a friendly Indian guy) was polite and friendly. Food was decent. Drinks ok
3
I had a bowl of Chilli and nachos but had to leave most of it as it was far too spicy. The nachos tasted freshly made. They need to learn to make the chilli,US style with better seasoningThe service was excellent and I was able to relax and eat my meal outside as I had time to 'kill' before my flight. The server was happy for me to relax. The price of my drink was reasonable considering the location,right on the rive
3
The service really took the shine off the whole experience.We just went for bottomless chips and cocktails which weren't too expensive. We ended up ordering quesadillas also which were fairly nice but they messed up so our friends waited much longer than we did.Cocktails were nice and not a bad price, 2 for $19. margarita jugs give you around 6 drinks from them. (Go on Wednesday then they are 1 for 1).Overall I would recommend but go for the deals and only order bottomless chips and dip (which are worth it
2
35 dollars for a small meal The staff are not the best in the market the setting is no different from an ordinary diner in USAIt lacks the theme of the former Billy Bombers in SingaporeGood place to buy a coffee and sit I would skip buying any food because it's too high and underwhelmin
1
Went there with family, just for a snack, while we were killing time before going to the airport. So we weren't hungry at all, but a bit tight in time.First of all, the waitress with her stiff face took so long to give the menu to us.There were 3 of us, we decided to order a snack platter to share and something else I forgot. We had planned to just order 2 drinks, but the waiter said NO SHARING DRINKS. Never have I heard of this silly rule elsewhere besides at an all you can eat restaurant (which is reasonable). Then came the food, bland, nothing special, we couldn't even be bothered to finish it. The visit there was a waste of time and waste of money. We should've gone elsewhere

The set lunch is a good size and good price too. There are a few options, I went for the double burger with side of chili - it was very tasty!!
5
Best to come every Wednesday as they have promotion... Love this branch as the place is very convenient plus they have the best margarita in town, good food is a bunos. Service is fast, as always.
5
This outlet always serve guest quite efficient and good food, bunos is their free brownie..love the food always. Most prefer restaurant around the area
5
True to chills elsewhere in the states but this place is popular for birthdays so big groups are competing for your order time. However food was good and the staff work very hard for their money

We ate here after coming out of the adjacent MRT station at Clarke Quay on the way back to our hotel.The waiting staff were quick to seat us and provide menus, but took some time to come back to take our order.Once ordered, it did not take too long for our food to be delivered, but only one drink arrived and we had to ask again for the second drink to be delivered.After deciding against dessert, I asked for the bill, and it took a further 10 minutes to be delivered. This was just before 10pm on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant was nowhere full, so service levels require to be improved

Im a chilis fan i used to visit your outlet at tanglin and the one at KL and im a lover of the hot chocolate but the experience at clarkequay was not very pleasant the waiter dont even look at you or dont even come to you. Even the seating we cannot choose the place where i want to sit its a very terrible place to go for special occasion. I literally hate to hear when someone say sorry sir that table is not open just because you are lazy to clean or to walk till there? And the food is not cheap i think you should respect the needs of a customer and not persuade them to listen to you. I will never visit the clarkequay outlet again

I used to love this restaurant, tried to make a visit every time I was in Singapore. The food is good fashioned American sports bar food, the boneless chicken wings are to die for along with most other things on the menu. Last two times I have been here they won't let our group sit outside, telling us the area us closed for the day at lunch time once and dinner the next (our attempt at dinner was on Thursday of the F1 at about 5pm). No one was sitting at the tables, they are set to eat at also, just not in use. This is a staff laziness issue and really disappointing as we have and will take our business elsewhere in future.

My wife is vegetarian and Chilis have good range of Vegeterian cource especially Mushroom pasta, Cheese items, also lot of drinks options. staff is friendly and they can also arrange for birthday cake and sing a song, thats the best par
3
We arrived on a Thursday night 90 minutes before closing. We were seated quickly but had to flag down a waitress for a drink order. I was excited about Chilis because I love US style burgers and I've had good experiences with the one in Clarke Quay when we traveled earlier in the year.This time it was four adults. The Nachos were a hit but my burger came out thin, small and very well done - I'd ordered it medium. The staff were very helpful, left the chips and went to do it again. This time the burger was a bit larger but still well done. I just ate it. It appears they're now using premade (maybe frozen) patties as they had a real mcdonlads look to them versus the thicker mince I expected.They gave me the burger for free and really did all they could (short of getting the burger right) to create a positive experience but rubbish burgers are everywhere and when I want a good one, Chilis was one of my go to places
3
My boyfriend received an email for free nachos from chili's Singapore. Chili's was celebrating their anniversary. So we decided to celebrate our Monthsary here. We reach the place and the manager was very accomodating. We inform her about the free nachos email and indeed we receive it in a big serving with salsa and one more hot dip. In addition to that, we also ordered our all time favourite quesedillas from chili's, baby back ribs and free flow iced tea. The serving size was very big which is good for sharing. Its a Thursday and got a lot of people with little staff. Though waiting time of the serving of the food was just nice, however, requested condiment takes time to deliver. The refilling of the free flow drinks was never in their priority. Need to ask them to refill and takes a while before they do
4
Visited with 31 others during lunch. Most probably our group was huge and they couldn't cope with our huge order. The food were tasty and quite huge portion. LOcation was just above Clark Quay MRT Station facing the main road instead of inside Central Mall.
5
Chillis is located near subway station at clarke quay. You can either stroll on the river side & have food at river side restaurants or visit this international food chain & enjoy standard food
1
I have always loved the variety and taste of the food at chillis.i also greated appreciate their variety of vegetarian friendly options. The servers were also always warm and friendly. however my trip today was a total disaster. i ordered the newly introduced 3 cheese enchiladas.i was promptly served the food,however when i was eating modway i was told that they had accidentally served chicken enchilladas to me. EVen though they changed the dish to the correct one , i am really paranoid ovee this issue as i am a vegetarian. I have completely lost trust in chillis and will never visit chillis again
2
$18++ for 12 nacho chips out of a bag with melted processed cheese sauce and a sprinkling of some sauce.This is an insult to intelligence of anyone. The margerita jug is watered down too.The only thing decent were the chicken wings.The floor manager was queuing people up outside, while 1/2 the restaurant was empty and not reserved. Families, and people on crutches were made to stand while floor manager refused to let anyone sit at empty tables. Finally after 5 minutes I confronted the manager and told her to let everyone (about 15 people) queung to at least sit. The manager essentially ignored me until i walked across the floor and demanded to be seated. She seating my party but kept the other 15 people standing. The managers only rationale to me was they were short of servers and could not service the whole place.1. IF you cant staff a a very popular restaurant then you have a range of problems i wont go into here.2. At least have human decent to allow families, disabled and elderly people to sit instead of making them queue.Fourth and last visit to this restaurant chain in Singapore. The management and owners need to go to the US, Australia or Philippines to learn how a Chillis should be run

Compare to the USA outlets, the ones here are far from the original and they definitely NEED to work more in terms of their service and food.July 7th,2015So here is how it goes, my boyfriend and I were the last ones to be served that evening after we had a tour around Singapore.It was near the closing hour of many normal operating restaurants and we didn't want to walk too far so we decided to land our tiring feet at this restaurant which sits conveniently outside the bus / train station. My American boyfriend craved for some food and we decided Chilli's would be a good option.Mistake - First time eating in this restaurant and possibly the last time.Service: Mediocre, they will attend to you only for the orders, but after that's about it.Staff not attentive enough and not as friendly as the experience we had in the US.We ran out of water and had to flag the staff for a refill or we get none.Ice 80% > Water 20%.Food:Over priced menu that have poor and limited selections.So I ordered a Guacamole Burger that comes with a small tin of prickled vegetables and a basket of fries.And my boyfriend got his a Crispy Chicken Crispers that comes with corn and fries. The food is alright.Both the chicken, fries portion is okay but my fries came out cold.Also, though the burger is a little smaller compared to ones in the US.But we both agreed that the meal is kinda over priced and not worth it.** I suspect the food isn't clean and we've possible - been served unclean food. Might be because we are the last pair to be served that evening. **The next day, my boyfriend have a terrible rash that broke out all over.It started from the arm then his allergy gotten worst and goes all the way to his neck, face and to the rest of his entire body.I am extremely upset with this happening because he have no problem or any food allergy to chicken, corn or fries.He loves honey mustard sauce and his meal comes with it. And to top that off, that is the only thing we had after the evening. Nothing else.We're seasoned travelers and we've been eating all kinds of food or even street food before and nothing have ever happened. Not until after that evening, the allergy and stomach ache came.I would put up pictures of his rash just to prove how bad his rash has become after the meal but I don't know if TripAdvisor allows it.In conclusion to my dining experience, I feel the menu is way over priced and needed more selection. The service and food is alright and can be better.The outside, table and chair seems clean enough but I don't know about the food hygiene level of this restaurant. I wouldn't return to this restaurant again

I am sitting in the restaurant right now. June 21,2015. At the first arrived 18.00 hrs. I was a huge Q. So many people waiting for the table. As all of us can see the whole section on door side of Central was empty. And the long hair & gray long sleeve shirt didn't tell us or ask for name an number for Q. We were very moody and one of us step out asking why let's us waiting in the heat area in stead of sit inside with air conditioning. Then we got replied that today shortage of staff. They needed to close one section. For christ sick today is Sunday dinner time. The management should expected that will hv a lot of customers. Why wouldn't they set enough staff to working today? My guess is not pay enough money or bad manager that made staff not to care for. The classic margaritas jug was nice. The nachos is something I never ever hv seen in any mexican restaurant in my life. It just look like a tortilla Pizza which 12 pieces of tortillas top with cheese and one slide of jalapeÃ±o for 18.90$,Really? The chicken wings is full of blood. If you wanna hv happy mexican meal I would recommended you to go to # Margaritas Restaurant # which located in East Coast or Demsy Hill is 100 times better that this place for >>> Food quality and service
1
I've been here twice, there won't be a third time. Service is lacklustre and food is hit or miss. I specifically asked for my food without bacon, the server repeated it to me and yet my food came with bacon and when I pointed it out, no apology.My friend got tummy ache from her food. The outlet at tanglin mall is much better than this one.
3
Just like the Chili's on Sentosa Island, the staff here were very friendly and helpful. We sat at a nice table outside by the river, so the view was good. While the food was pretty good, the alcoholic drinks were way watered down, compared to Sentosa Island. On Sentosa, I could only sip the president margarita, which lasted the entire meal (as comes with shaker to refil your glass a few times), whereas I could drink the same thing here like it was lemonade or something. Sentosa Island Chilis gets a 5 out of 5 :
2
I'm normally a positive guy but this time I went to the wrong restaurant.The nachos were home made but not warm followed by guacamole with lots of corn in it not to my liking.The main course were served while I still was nibbling on my starter and got cold before I got to it. I ordered a chicken salad to stay a bit healthy but it was greasy with a few salad leaves and probably more cheese than any healthy bits.The frozen margarita was nice so they crept up to two stars!
1
We chose to dine here after seeing posters on the windows advertising burgers for $12.90. When we asked if we could order the advertised burgers we were told by our unfriendly waitress that they were not on the menu today. At that point we should have left, but seeings as we had already previously ordered drinks we decided to stay and ordered 2 beef burgers off the menu. The service was very bad and we were treated as if we were an inconvenience. And to top it off when we got the bill it was $73.00. All we ordered was the 2 burgers and 2 soft drinks. I checked the bill carefully thinking they must have added extra dishes but no there was only what we ordered plus GST and service fees. They were the most expensive burgers I have ever had plus they were not even very nice! And as for paying extra for bad service......?? Hmmm...I will NEVER go back to this restaurant!
5
Went for dinner with friends and planned to share dishes. We underestimated the food portion and ended up overloading our stomach. The food portion is big and well valued for the price we paid for. Great restaurant ambiance and the waiters are very friendly.
5
In case you are a Chili's regular customer, singapore won't disappoint you. Chili's clarke quay will not disappoint you in terms of it's location, ambiance & food. I was there with my wife & we had a nice time :)
4
Great atmosphere, very clean and lovely staff. The food is not the authentic Mexican food but it is a good alternative if you are not expecting too much.
5
My family went here on a whim (though we would have liked to have gone across the street to the local place that had a line out the door), and we were really pleased with the service and food. Siva was our server and did a great job, was very friendly and polite. The food was surprisingly good, particularly the burger I had (hence the title of this review). So many times SE Asia messes up red meat, but not this time. As usual in Singapore at a western place, it's a little pricey. Figure around 70 USD for a family of five
1
Been there as wanted to try something different...well nothing Mexican or different! Service is not good. Gt a seat next to kitchen even though resto wasn't full. Chicken wings were really not good at all - very bad taste! A burger which was again very bad! And oh..the price...well not again
4
First the food was great as usual. We enjoyed the chili n the mini handcrafted burger. The kid's menu was appealing as usual and both mine had the mac n cheese, which was their favourite.I want to compliment the staff in the restaurant. Although they seemed understaffed n service was not as prompt as we would like, but everyone kept their smile n tried to help when asked.My son lost his handphone in the restaurant. We went bk less than 15 mins after we left the store. The waitress quickly asked the guest sitting at the same booth to stand up so that she cpuld chk. They did not find it but promised that they would look for it as soon as the store closes. Indeed, they found it the next day after pulling out the whole booth to search for it n i got a call to inform me. They also kept it in the safe for a few days while waiting for me to go back n collect it.Thank you for the help

We came from the airport on the way to the hotel and were super hungry. Passed by this restaurant and thought it looked ok for a quick lunch. Expected some burger and texas style food. We hade burgers that tasted like they had bought the most inexpensive hamburger at the supermarket and microwaved them. Also had a caesar sallad that hardly had any chicken and absolutely no ceasar sallad just some iceberg lettuce. The rest of the week we always made a joke about the restaurant when passing it like "are you hungry? I know a great place"... Don't go there if any other restaurants are open. The pricing is so far from what you get
1
When we first arrived at this restaurant we explained that my wife has an allergy to garlic. We asked about a particular item on the menu and were told, after the server checked with the kitchen, that the item was free of garlic. We ordered the item. 5 minutes later we were told that the item contained garlic and were advised to order the salmon since this appeared to be the only item on the menu without garlic. We ordered the salmon. When the meal was delivered the salmon was smothered in garlic butter. We sent it back. 10 minutes later, another meal appeared. There was probably garlic in some part of this meal as my wife was very ill shortly after eating this meal. Anyone with a food allergy should absolutely avoid this restaurant. As for the meals for the other 3 people in the our party I would say that the food was mediocre at best
5
Our family of three Ate at Chilis today for lunch. We had the triple dipper starter, followed by half rack of ribs which fell off the bone, chicken tex mex salad,ranch chicken burger. We had cocktails that were great and a San Miguel beer. Service was good & all meals were very tasty
3
This was probably my worst meal in Singapore, and one of the more expensive ones.They were apparently short staffed, because they wouldn't let me sit outside by the river because that section wasn't open. In fact, they wouldn't let me sit by the windows looking out on the river. As an older single woman, I didn't particularly want to sit next to a couple with loud, rambunctious children. I was able to move two tables away.It took a long time to be waited on. I ordered the California Chicken Flatbread and was definitely underwhelmed. The mayonnaise squirted on top was a turn-off. I didn't finish it, and asked to have the remainder boxed up for me to take with me. When I got it, it was dumped into a plastic bag (supposedly to microwave it in) but with the pieces jumbled up this wasn't going to happen. I guess if you have a real hankering for the American version of chips and salsa, come here. Otherwise, there are better choices in the food court in the same building
4
We love to stop in here for a little taste of home with a twist. The menu is slightly different and I love the spicy chicken pasta alfredo. We enjoy the bottomless chips and salsa. And the Coke light with refills is a joy.
4
Chilis serves amazing mexican on any day with bottomless nachos and cocktails
they still serve Yummy margaritas, try the presidential!! It Has very many options for vegetarians too.Friendly staff and quick service.
5
Justified the Chili's brand name. Great food, reasonable price and attentive service a stones throw from the Singapore River. Had my usual Fajitias, Steak and Shrimp in this case. Another day had Beef Quesadillas, all were excellent.
4
Nice enviroment. Food portion was generous and staffs are friendly. The BBQ ribs along with the classic nachos is mouth watering.. Had a great dinner and kids love it too.
5
I had a great time with my group of friends at this restaurant. The 4 of us were seated at a good large table. The food was delicious, quickly served. Some of our order placed include the Triple Dipper, Triple Fajitas, Pepp Pizza, Steaks and Chicken Sandwiches and of course the bottomless chips.As we could not consume pork, I remember the waiter was helpful in pointing out to us which food items were more suitable for us. It's nice to know that some ingredients can be customized to our preference.Perhaps it was our lucky evening but service was top notch, served with a smile and our drinks were always refilled. If remembered correctly, the male staff who mainly served us was named "Hafeex". This is my third visit to Chili's and more to come for sure. Perhaps the company would consider revising the pricing as I feel that the prices are steep

We celebrated our son's 10th birthday at Chilli's @ Central, Clarke Quay. Everything went very well and it was one of our best birthday experience. The service, ambience and food was well above expectations. I made the reservation one day prior, requesting for a nice cosy corner for our family. And indeed we were given a lovely table (I recalled speaking to "Madhi" for the reservations). When we arrive, everything went smooth, the staff were all very smiley, happy, attentive and courteous. Our server Jeanette was really fantastic, she made some good suggestions for the food and everything was done promptly and served efficiently. Food portion was good, the ribs and chicken sandwich were amazing ! The loveliest surprise was that Jeanette & Sasha prepared the candles on the cake (which I brought) and they sang the birthday song (with another lady staff whom I did not get the name) for my little boy. He was blushing but very happy to be treated so special. And making this occasion even more special and beautiful, we realized that kids ate free and there was NO service charge ! Thank you very much Chilli's and everyone at Central. We were also given a free brownie which was a really nice sweet gesture.. I will definitely return to Chilli's and highly recommend this restaurant esp for family get-together
4
We had some nice dinner here. The "kids eat for free" special was very nice :-)The location of the restaurant is nice, with outdoor seating looking out on the Singapore River. The food was just like in the US branched of Chili's, so nothing to complain there!We had a very friendly waiter who got everything just right
5
All meals were delicious with good portion size. Slight mixup with my ribs, received galic bread instead of beans. No big deal as the ribs more than met my expectations. Margaritas were enjoyable and certainly went well with the meal. I would highly recommend this place for price, quality and service. A good break from local cuisine
2
I've visited Chili's in the United States and in Singapore (three locations) and have always enjoyed their margaritas and the food too. But the last visit to their outlet at Clarke Quay was deeply disappointing.The margarita - their 'classic' cocktail - was the worst I have had in memory (and I'm not that young!). I had to ask them to improve it, which they tried to do - with little success. The snack was not bad, though a little low on quantity. I tried to give some feedback to the server, but the response was, like the margarita, indifferent... If you're looking for a good margarita in Singapore, this is not the place
4
Loved it! Being first timers to Singapore we weren't too sure about the food so tried chills as it as across the road from our hotel and looked like familiar food. YUM! We ended up there twice, had the sliders, pulled pork burger and warm chocolate chip cookie skillet with ice cream. They have bottomless beverages and everything on the menu looks delicious. Onion rings are to die for and I could drink the ranch dressing! I asked if I could buy it!!! Only down point was with our first visit we were only one of two people in the restaurant it was a quiet afternoon and my mum had almost finished her meal by the time mine came out, I thought they had forgotten but it came eventually. Second time around service was much better. Would eat here again next time I'm in Singapore
4
This place is the best tex mex restaurant I have ever tried. Love their classic nachos which are prepared in individual portions so every bite has the perfect amount of all the ingredients. Their bottomless drinks are a kicker!
4
For people that like a USA food fix, Chili's is a good start, maybe not the best Mexican food, but pretty good. Service is good, drinks are pricey (but thats Singapore). Share plates and experience all the flavours.
4
Really good fun. Chicken jalapeno pasta was absolutely fantastic! Reasonably priced with nice staff.
4
The people were very friendly and attentive. Food was great, prompt and they made sure we were fed well!

Fitting to its name as a bar, patronage who enjoyed the companion of a high decibel environment would fit right in. Unfortunately for me, I was not at home in such environment. The ambient was so full of cacophony that we barely heard ourselves speaking, and the music blaring at us didn't make things better.The waiters and waitresses would zipped here and there, appearing almost everywhere except when you tried to get their attention. Most of the time they were too busy serving dishes or bringing guests to appointed tables, leaving their focus split between tasks and getting them to take your order a daunting matter.Despite my dislike for loud places, I still chose to revisit Chili's for one reason - its food. One should be prepared for its serving, an amount not for light eaters unless left to starve. My personal favourite so far has been a crispy chicken dish deliciously named Crispy Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers. The honey coated exterior lend the meaty dish an addictive taste on top of its crispiness, as if the latter was not enough to encourage diners.Of course a refreshing beverage is always necessary to wash down after ravaging a meal. I particularly appreciate Chili's Bottomless Beverage section where the drinks could be refilled, and with the size of the glass approaching the definition of a mug, you wouldn't need to frequently ask for refills. This would be especially useful for crowds looking to spend a long night of hearty discussion and gossips, where the drinks can keep on coming until you get ready to go
4
I've been to a few Chili's in the States (and in the UK when we used to have them) and so was keen share the experience with my partner who had never been. It serves filling, comfort food along with a great range of beers and drinks. Chili's may not win any Michelin stars, but if you like burgers, chicken and quesadilla then you're definitely in the right place. The staff were friendly and the service efficient. You have to leave the restaurant and enter the mall to go to the toilet, but that's the only gripe during a nice, filling, lunch
5
As an expat living in singapore, i come to this place to get some western/tex food at reasonable prices. There is no view like clarke or boat quay, only windows out to eu tong sen streetFood however is fabulous, and also prices are okay. Especially the margaritas are an excellent choice. Will come there many times, also in the future

I am a regular at this restaurant and am a fan of their food. Their lunch deals are priced very well indeed. Apart from the special lunch deals, the restaurant is a bit on the pricey side in my opinion. Food quality is however good.Over the last couple of months though I have been concerned about the hygiene levels at this restaurant. The side entrance which is from within the Central building itself is located after the public toilets. In that passage way, the stench of the toilet is very obvious. And this leads up to the restaurant entrance.To make things worse, this passageway smells of an uncleaned mop being used to clean the passageway. The same stench is also very regularly felt in the restaurant itself. Yes the restaurant will get dirty and needs to be swept and mopped every day - but based on the smell it seems the the mop is not clean or not enough fresh chemicals / dettol is being used in cleaning the place.The management should look into this urgently before the Ministry of Health pays a surprise visit and penalises the restaurant.Based on this experience, I have often felt that if these are the hygiene standards for the restaurant in the public area, can I really trust the hygiene standards of the restaurant's kitchen ? I am a huge fan and am often here about twice a week - but the hygiene doubts are making me rethink visiting the restaurant more often
1
Wifi did not work & staff were unconcerned. Meal took forever and when arrived was missing key ingredients. Very poor value for money.
5
This is a typical American/Mexican style diner situated on Clarke Quay. There is a bar area & it is family friendly.I had crispy chicken tacos which were delicious and my husband had BBQ ribs with fries & black beans. A bottle of 'Stella' each too.Great food, good portions & value. So good we went again
4
Chili's is an international chain, and the food at any of their stores is as good as the next. The one in Clarke Quay was clean with quick and attentive service staff.
4
I was served by siva, tall indian guy who suggested there promotions as well as there margaritas.im always been a fan of chilis sg but i loved the atmosphere in central more. Fast service , great food and friendly staff...
5
Ribs here is one of the best.. Not to mention their presidente margarita that looks like teasing us to get tipsy and the price is not overrated. This place might not have the best service but the quality is of the food and drinks is just one of the bes
5
No, there's nothing subtle about going to Chili's! it's deep fried, it's cheese, it's delicious! We had a hankering for tex-mex and this location is handy. It's not really genuine Tex-Mex but it hit the spot nonetheless. We ate:Texas Cheese Fries (between two of us, SO filling)Country Fried Chicken (comes withh mash & corn on the cob)Vegetarian Quesadillas (comes with mexican rice, black beans, pico de gallo & sour cream)We were stuffed to the gills after this lot, it was all good and washed down with a cold beer. The whole bill was about $70, not bad for Singapore and the beers were about $20 of this so all in all, good value.If you have enough of noodles, chicken rice and chili crab, this is the place to go :
5
It was busy night..but still I'll be cheating if i rate it lower than 5... it was frst recommnded by a friend from the hotel im stayin so i was thinkin ill give it a try aftr our tour since we'll get off in clarky anyway. Staffs are lovely.. i was taken care of ..and the food are just amazing, how i wish we also have it here in Melbourne. I'll definitely visit you guys again.

Had the New York steak, medium rare with a bottle of San Miguel. Delicious but had to cut off a few chunks of fat. So in truth it could have been leaner

After all the Asian and European cuisines, I was enticed to try out Mexican food next, hence dragged my one of my good friends Edwin* to Chilis at Central Mall for a Mexican dinner.The restaurant in question was non-pretentious at all, exquisite in its own way with beer-mugs chandelier lamps and chairs carved with the Chilis sign, but other than that, offers a very relaxed and comforting ambience for diners to enjoy good, fulfilling meals without feeling out of place.We started with the signature Beef Chili with Nachos – tender bits of beef slow-cooked in a thick, delicious gravy with onions, peppers and chilis (but note that this does not taste spicy at all) topped with sour cream and cheese. It was delicious simply eaten on its own, or eaten as a topping on one of their thick, crispy slices of Nacho Chips.I eagerly dug into my Chili Shrimp Quesadilla – a very delicious heap of melted jack cheese, shrimp, roasted jalapenos and corn salsa wrapped within thin flatbread sheet made of flour / corn. The burst of savoury flavours toned down by the slightly-grainy texture and light sweetness of the quesadilla skin – it was very pleasing to the mouth.For more detailed information and photos, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/dinner-at-chilis-mexican-restaurant.htm

Went to the outlet @ Clarke Quay on Monday. The food is really nice. Portion is generous too. Order the Crispy Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers, Grilled Baby Back Ribs and Chile Shrimp Quesadillas shared among 3 super hungry women.. and we can't finish it. Even the sides are very well served!However, the only thing they need to improve is their service.I believe they are shorthanded.. But we went during a weekday. Monday to be exact and it's tough to get the waitress/waiter attention
4
We loved Chili's for the fjitas, quesadaillas and the drinks. Their portions are huge so for 3 pax, order 2 mains and that is enough. Even appetizers are larger in portion than usual asian restaurant offerings. Love the Grey Goose Lemonade. Crowded and needs some queuing. Love the tender chicken fajita, taste to have it even without the tortilla shells. The calamari slight too salty. The nachos are spicy
5
Chilli Crab at this restaurant is really fantastic, the service was excellent as well. Sitting by the Singapore River watching the boats and taking in the wonderful atmosphere was priceless add to all this the laser light show from Marina Bay Sands makes a very special night
