Great awesome prata served with smiles all
Round. My usual breakfast include 2 prata kosong and 1 milo dinosaur...guaranteed to keep you happy and hearty till lunch time...and when lunch comes along, be sure to order their famous mutton briyani....simply irresistable!

I love Indian food, and the Banana Leaf is a landmark in Singapore. The food is always good, the service if friendly, and I stop by on every trip

Great menu selections. Lots of small plates to sample. Place could be cleaner, but the food selection makes it a must see visit
