Restaurant's atmosphere was quiet enough for a chat but with nice background music. Food was good with layers in flavour. Not cheap but worth it.

Have been here 3 times - once for brunch and twice for dinner & drinks. Food's a little pricy but the portions are good for sharing. Love that they always have new cocktails on the menu to try out!

Great atmosphere with great service! We ordered the whole chicken and it tasted amazing! Food was unique in taste!

Went there again with the family and I failed to get the photos saved. Probably because we got to it faster. Enjoyed the breads, dips, Long black, even the cocktails. The menu in itself is interesting and the staff was always ready and very helpful.

Went to Crackerjack for the first time under the recommendation of a friend. Shared the steak, lamb and fish with a couple of friends. Food was fresh, service was friendly but not too in your face. Will go again.

Crackerjack provides good services, food and drinks. I would love to try more of their dishes! The sweet potato hash was awesome.

The service and the experience were great. The staff was helpful and knowledgable. The food was decent. It is a good place to chill with friends on weekend.

Visited the place for brunch on a Saturday morning. The place was pretty empty although there was quite a number of tables with reservation signs on. QFC (S$16++)quinoa fried chicken, served with spicy banana ketchup and jicama slawI had never thought of using quinoa for breading. It gave a kind of popping effect in the mouth when bit. The breaded crust was thin and crispy, while inside was packed with juicy meaty meat. The slaw was tangy and brought out the appetite.Bourbon Mashbill Grits ($13++) Corn, rye, barley, smoked cheddar, soft egg, chicken scratchingsAdd bacon (S$4++)It looked plain like baby food with its gooey texture. Mixed all up, it tasted surprisingly savoury good with strong cheese taste.aguas frescas of the day (S$7++)Green apple + watermelon + sodaThe staff had asked about my preference before making this drink. It was like a bespoken drink. It tasted quite refreshing and fruity

A friend and I shared the horchata pancakes, the funnel cake, and the fried quinoa chicken - everything was delicious! The portions are a bit small, though. The flat white was served in a tiny little cup, so I would suggest changing that sizing out for a regular sized cup.

We just missed the Brunch time on a weekday at Crackerjack and decided to eat an early lunch instead.We were advised to get the Set Lunch, which we did. Broccoli Soup with Roasted Garlic Cream, Mushroom Barley Risotto (topped with Blue Cheese)/Mushroom-Lentil Scotch Eggs, and Freshly squeezed Grapefruit Juice & a Latte respectively. They were very sweet about switching up our drinks (and, they didn't charge for it, despite us being willing to pay). Ace customer service!The food was gorgeous. There was a hefty helping of salad with both the main courses, the flavours were top notch, and the portions just right. I'd love to go back

Nice space. Service is spotty. Itâ€™s pretty expensive too for what is served. Food was so so, not that nice

I have been to Crackerjack twice now and very impressed with the quality of the coffee making equipment and expertise of the staff, especially the barista named Carmen. She makes the best coffee in Singapore, hands down.

The bone broth was always delicious and good to go with their sourdough (although a bit too salty). The coffee was decent.

One of our favourite places to eat - Really tasty and different food options, especially if you're vegetarian. Great atmosphere and style with fast and attentive service.

Zack and Brendan are friendly and amazing. I Had a good time there. The bar is pretty nice as well!!!

Brendan and his staff were very friendly and attentive. The smoothies were really tasty and our breakfasts were too. Plan to stop by one evening for the food and cocktails!

Food: Delicious, freshly made hummus. Bone marrow soup can cure a cold and / or hangover.Cocktails: Twist on the traditional aperol Spritz is house-made, inspired by the bartenders love of cocktails and house-made ingredients. It tastes like a Christmassy spritz! Creative and fun. Service: Ronan is superb. Great cocktails, gets creative with what you like, and clearly loves what he does! Thanks for a great time

Mains were in the range of $20 to $30 which is common for similar establishments, but portions were rather small. Although Crackerjack seems to market itself as a dining-coffee-cocktails "concept cafe" - whatever that means - I would simply consider it a bar which sells food. That would make so much more sense.That said, the service was good and the servers attentive and happy to accommodate our requirements. Had a birthday celebration here with a medium-sized group and we were generally satisfied.Note that there is a $25 cakeage fee if your bring your own cake - a relatively uncommon practice in Singapore

Eight of us came to have dinner and ordered their special "we'll feed you" menu (that the waiter said we're gonna be filled) so it's kinda assorted food, they say... however when the food started to be served, they come in very small, one plate serving which to my opinion, too little to share! See photos Nevertheless... nothing can be said further.. the food keeps coming and luckily it's good enough. Lastly, each person is about $50+!
