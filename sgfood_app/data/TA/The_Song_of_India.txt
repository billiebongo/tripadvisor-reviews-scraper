Not the place to go if you're looking for traditional Indian food but it's unusually amazing. Really good fusion of east meets west.The restaurant is set in a charming classic black and white heritage bungalow. The decor is smoke but elegant and the food was simply amazing. We were particularly impressed by how accommodating the staff were: they willingly changed two of the courses of the set menu (we went there on valentine's day) for my girlfriend (who has food allergies) based on a la carte items. Special thanks to the staff, Thina who served us that night! Will definitely re-visit
5
A great place for a special occasions: beautiful food, great service, fine interior. Go for set menu and you wont regret. It was a great experience of Indian cuisine taken to another level of fine dining. Will go back any time

Took my family here for a surprise birthday lunch for my hubby. We opted for the buffet, which has a decent spread including starters, soup, Indian breads (served directly from kitchen instead of from the buffet), mains, fruits and desserts. We enjoyed the food and ambience, and the many waiters were attentive, professional and friendly towards my daughter. She got a complimentary mango lassi in the beginning of the meal, we received Indian masala chai tea towards the end of the meal. Do note that kids are also charged for the buffet (kids rate, my daughter is 5 years old). The restaurant is housed in an old colonial building with grounds outside where kids can run around. We left satisfied with full tummies

I went there for Valentine’ Day and the food and atmosphere were pleasant. This is a perfect place to celebrate an occasion.
5
My second visit here for Valentine Night. Great and organize service. Justin is always attentive and polite. Wonderful the Lucknavi Lamb shank, really tasty. I brought a bottle of wine and the corkage was in a reasonable price range. Great experience agai
4
We went to the Song of India for Valentine's Day and went with the set menu for the Day. All the dishes were really tasty and comparable to other Michelin-star rated Indian restaurants we have experienced around the world (Dubai, Geneva and San Francisco). The service was most memorable as too were the lamb and especially the naan. The best naan we had ever tasted, it had a subtle flaky texture.Highly highly recommended
5
My husband and I are visiting Singapore as part of our 25th wedding anniversary celebration. Having our final dinner at Song of India made our trip! Excellent food, impeccable yet friendly service and luxurious atmosphere. We had the Journey Through India tasting menu..... outstanding!
5
Fabulous food combined with great service made our 25th wedding anniversary evening so special. Highly recommended
4
Food presentation, ambience and hospitality were nice. Information about all food items was given. Enjoyed evenin
5
We visited the restaurant with great expectations last night and were bowled over by the experience. The maitre d’ was helpful and carefully explained the menu to us. Rohit was our waiter and he was fantastic. He took time to explain how the food was cooked and was very attentive, appearing just in time to re-fill our wine glasses and was very charming. If we had more time during this visit we would re-visit just for the Goan Fish curry which was exquisite - such magnificent flavour and texture. We will definitely return next time we are Singapore. In fact, it is almost worth a return trip to this wonderful country just to dine at Song of India (& eat the Goan Fish curry)!!!!
4
We visited it on 13th Feb 2018, food is really nice, good ambiance and professional staff. Best place for any special occasion. Price $$$ but fine for fine dining. Close to Netwon MRT and easily accessible. Dishes really attractive in terms of taste and presentation.Worth for a good evening!!
3
The ambiance is really good, can choose it for a romantic dinner with ur loved one, but food taste and quantity is not worth for money.Best thing we experienced is their arrangements on my special request like candle light dinner and special cake.Many thanks to Mr.Rohit for the wonderful service
4
little bit pricey. not all dishes were good..prefer if they close late for lunch as sunday afternoon
5
We went for Saturday lunch buffet. The dishes are tasty and light, bringing an unique flavour to Indian cooking not seen elsewhere
5
The lunch buffet gives you a good taste of North Indian cuisine. Good selection of vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes. We were served by Rohit who was very attentive through our meal. He ensured that we finished our starters before our naan was served as accompaniments to our mains. This was to ensure the naan was fresh and warm. The garlic naan was soft and fluffy. So good when eaten warm! We were reluctant to try the desserts but Rohit brought us the warm Gulab Jamun with vanilla ice cream and it was such as amazing combination! It's my first experience with North Indian cuisine and I'm acquainted withÂ an entirely new dimension of aromatic and diverse range of traditional food wonders
5
This was a last minute choice during a short stopover in Singapore but it proved to be a good one. From the moment we arrived the service was excellent and the food is on the same level. We both had the chef's taster menu ( one vegetarian, one non vegetarian) and both were beautifully presented and perfectly spiced. It's not cheap but you get what you pay for and I would heartily recommend it
1
I was told about 1 hour prior to my appointment that restaurant was not available at the time of my appointment and I should come half an hour earlier which was simply not possible. So, going forward, please check all these things before providing a slot for appointment which would be quite helpful. As such I am unable to review.
5
We were served by the staff Rohit who is very courteous and helpful. He gave good recommendations on the food and we enjoyed our lunch
5
We took some visiting friends for dinner and we all loved it. The service was outstanding and the food was faultless. We had the Journey Through India menu and it was incredibly well put together, it was a lot of food but a lovely sample of some of the finest Indian food I have ever had. Having spent many months in India, and eaten in many fine dining restaurants I would happily recommend the Song of India to anyone, it is definitely in the top few Indian restaurants I have even visited
5
In town visiting and being from Los Angeles, wanted to try some of the excellent Indian food I have heard about in Singapore. Hotel concierge recommended and they were right on. Food was fantastic along with the presentation! We each ordered a tasting menu and everything was so flavorful and high quality. We just had local beers which were good. Service was impeccable as well. Highly recommend
5
Very tasty food with balanced seasoning. Suitable for mild tastes. A wide selection of traditional Indian dishes from different regions as well as restaurant specialties. The service is excellent and all waiters are very attentive. Significant discounts with AmEx cards
5
This was our 4th visit to the Song of India, and once again it did not disappoint. We chose the Journey through India set menu and every element of every course was delicious. Matched with excellent service, we will return again
3
Had lunch with my foreign friend from Pakistan. Nice ambience. Main courses were above average. The venison curry I had was not wow for me as the curry favor was not well infused into the meat.Service was good but not great considering a Michelin star restaurant. Had two mains, one daal, naan and white rice to share and 2 bottles of sparkling water. Paid more than $100 after AMEX discounts
5
The staff provided superb service with brilliant smiles throughout my visit there. The food, Masha Allah, is fabulous in presentation and taste! Worth to dine there....
4
Excellent Indian cuisine and great service from Prasad. We enjoyed our dinner. The starters and main course recommended by Prasad were excellent. The wine selections were also good. Will definitely return.
4
Great place and good ambiance Food was really nice and staff is very friendly.Food and presentation is good
5
This review has been Long waiting. This is the second time we went there for dinner on my wife’s birthday. But even before this we had been with our Friends and family and each time Songs of India has won us with its sumptuous spread of food from soups, starters to main course and dinner. The menu tries to be true to India and its flavours. The tomato-coriander soup is one of the best we had so far and sets the tone for the upcoming delicacies. My personal favourite is Laal Maas - succulent deer meat in reddish gravy and Goan fish curry.It’s housed in a serene location away from bustling crowd. Staff was helpful and attentive. Would like to specially mention our attendant Mr Prasad who made our visit special by his warm demeanour and thoughtfulness. His introduction of the dishes before serving us was no less than a prelude of an interesting novel.Overall the ambience, food, service and thoughtfulness of the staff is what would make me visit this place again
5
Our table was looked after by Prasand the waiter. Very well behaved and his service was Super excellent. The ambiance and the environment was very nice. Would recommend to everyone to go and visit and try their food.
5
Recently visited on our wedding anniversary as a family, Steward found out the occasion from my Daughter in a friendly welcoming conversation. We enjoyed vegetarian meal, presentation & taste of starters was really good. Kothimbir wadi in a menu was a delight. Prasad our table Steward, presenting us a cake with candle was really a sweet gesture, made our dinner memorable. Also presented us a nice photograph capturing the special moment. In summary, the place is with friendly staff, nice ambience clubbed with delicious food
4
For my first Indian experience I decided to try this star restaurant. It was good but I was not too impressed. Maybe it is just me not being too keen on Indian cuisine
5
Located in the type of lovely house that is fast disappearing in Singapore, the restaurant has lovely decor and atmosphere. The a la carte menu looked great but we opted for one vegetarian testing menu and one (my) Journey through India menu. Both were superb, in fact when the surprisingly large mains arrived I knew I couldn't finish. Every course was great, with the tandoori appetizers (both salmon and chicken) being amazing, juicy and full of flavor. My wife actually said that the portions should be smaller, something rarely said in the context of Singapore fine dining. For either a upmarket couples date night, birthday or special occasion this is a civilized choice with great good, service and atmosphere
5
great service, good food, lovely location near town, recommend to make reservation online by chope.co...michelin 1 star
5
Excellent food and service. Authentic cuisine, high quality ingredients. Lovely intimate place for a birthday lunch.
4
We loved the food and the atmosphere is great with smiling and friendly waiters and waitress.The presentation of the dishes are excellent
5
I visited The Song of INDIA last weekend with my family and was pleased to get a great authentic Indian food after a Long time in Singapore. Thanks to Mr Prasad and his team for an excellent service.
4
The food is very good with generous portions & nicely presented. Service was also very good. Would recommend for anyone looking for an Indian meal in Singapore

The whole experience at Song of India was strange. I went in there expecting big things given how pricey the place is. It cost me $93 for my food, one beer and water. What that got me is a really small selection of food that was very bland and just not modern at all.The chef prides himself as someone who cooks using modern methods but the whole experience feels like something out of the 90's. The plate was at least 20 years old and nothing had any pop or vibrancy that most Indian dishes have. I pride myself as a huge Indian food lover and cook a lot at home and I was a bit embarrased walking out of the restaurant at the end. To top things off, despite being in an expensive restaurant there were loads of flies and I didn't even get that at the hawker markets.Save yourself a lot of money and visit places like the Noodle Story or My Awesome Cafe
4
Nice experience . Good food , good experience and good value for money. Daal makhani was the best I ever had in a Long time!
5
Very very nice food. Superb taste. Fresh mithai daal makhni dum briyani samsoa are awesome. Nice seating arrangement. Good service.
5
Had one of the best and delicious food in Singapore here . Staff is so friendly. Good service nd a special thanks to the staff member (rohit ) for helping us with our food choices . A must visit restaurant for tasty Indian food
4
It is our first time dining in a upscale indian restaurant and it certainly did not disappoint us. My wife was enticed by the eggplant with curry and spices dish. They have a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options so definitely you could find something for yourself. Price is on the higher side but indulge once in a while doesn't kills you eh?
4
My husband booked candle light dinner for us , it was good experience along with peaceful ambiance. Staff service is very good , Food is tasty , they could enhance the taste and flavours of punjabi curries , Staff - MR. Gagan was very obedient and good observer and helpful too. Jaypuri Tikki , Juice of the month - Watermelon mixed juice was up to the mark , starters were lucrative in taste Main course was not Satisfying the taste buds. They surprised us by having Couple photo and cupcake which was complimentary as they found its birthday celebration.Overall it’s worth to go there
5
True to it's word..... Hospitality....we were a little late and dying for tasty Indian food, the managers after asking the chef, served authentic Indian Mughlai food.Taste.....yummy threeCrispy naan , a portion of paneer makhani and plain rice were sufficient for four of the family.Damages.....55-60 Singapore dollars but loved it.Ambience...... perfect Suggestions.....a little away from market place say 750 metres but Google helped a lot.....must try in Singapore
5
The food was great! And the restaurant made it extra special by having a bouquet of fresh flowers for us at the table. They also got us a yummy mousse cake at the end and gave us a photo memento!!!The Spice Route cocktail was good too!
4
The food was very good but service could be improved as it’s a fine dining restaurant as staff need to be as competent to that level of service.Nice ambience and place to chill out
5
Visit this restaurant when you are in Singapore. The Chef here - Manjunath has got 2 michellin star and his food is mindblowing. I hope this restaurant does not require any review as it has got michellin star chef
5
I first experienced Song Of India when my business partners took me for a business lunch there. I liked it very much and when I visited Singapore for the Christmas-New Year break I took my wife for dinner there. We both enjoyed it very much. Our waiter, Rohit, made helpful suggestions for two of the three dishes that we ordered and both turned out to be excellent. After the meal was over the staff very helpfully ordered taxi for us to return to our hotel. Also I had left a package behind and Rohit immediately brought it over to us as we were entering the taxi. Overall, I would say it is an excellent fine dining experience for anyone who is in Singapore and has a yen for Indian food
4
good food. limited offering. Stars 1.gulab jamun and kheer.2.Mutton and bone to pick is with the Daal. Prices offcourse are $$$ and there is Yantra with much more for similar price point
5
Situated on Scott's road, this restaurant has a very good ambience and most important the food was tasty esp. the starters and the vegetarian curries. Would recommend the broccoli & zucchini fried starters and Rajasthani potato curry. Justin attended to us very well and his recommendations were bank on. Will visit again for sure
4
Food is not too heavy in flavour and oil so you can really enjoy the varieties of tastes and flavours. Attentive service by Gagan who serves with a smile and patiently explains each dish before asking guests to enjoy the food. Tables are well laid out so there is privacy for each table. Worth a visit if you are looking for delicious Indian food in a classy environment.
5
Paneer tikka was good but taste was a but stale. Better don't use colour. Keep is original white with seasoning of butter
5
Food was great. Great flavor and fast to serve! Was served by Rohit who was absolutely courteous and professional in special gestures for my wifeâ€™s birthday. Made our dinner memorable.
5
Very good, visited with my girlfriend for dinner. We had the journey through India set menu, I had the one with meat and my girlfriend the vegetarian version, we both enjoyed it immensely. Service was excellent, I really enjoyed that I could pace the food on my discretion, would go again. Michelin star well deserved
5
The food and service here are outstanding. I visited this restaurant with my wife on 28 December. The staff were very attentive and explained the different dishes to us. It is not your onion bhaji and vindaloo kind of place. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The only downside was the family groups with uncontrollable screaming babies. This is not just our experience. Just before we left at 9.30pm another couple moved tables from the other side of the restaurant to escape the mayhem
5
The Taste of meal was great. The presentation of food was unique. The staff is very friendly especially Mr. Rohit
5
Came to Song of India for our anniversary dinner because I was hankering for Indian food. Place has easy parking and has a beautiful setting. The service was impeccable and very prompt. Our waiter Prasad was very helpful especially given my inability to take spicy food, and have a few spot on recommendations as well as warnings when some of the dishes were spicy. The Lucknavi Gilawat Kebab was really unique.. See photo! It wasn't chunky kebab but very soft pan seared minced lamb served on a very instagrammable platter. We also enjoyed the deep fried okra and the palak paneer was delicious. The dishes were actually sizable and we didn't expect it to be that much food between the 2 of us. Doggy bag was thankfully available lol. Overall it was an enjoyable dining experience and we do feel the restaurant deserves the Michelin star..! Will be back to try other dishes which we spied when they whizzed past us to other diners..
5
We are served by Gagan during our visit there and he made great conversation with us while we waited for our food to be served. Gagan would also check on us frequently to see if our needs is met during the whole course of dinner. Food is presented very nicely and taste good.
3
We had the buffet lunch, and the food was bit average for a restaurant so talked about. Selection was small.The restaurant was nice but the air conditioning was not working, making for a difficult experience
5
Coming from the Uk we have experienced many a good Indian restaurant. We also know Singapore has a great number of choices when it comes to food. However our overall experience of The Song of India was excellent. Great food combined with great service
5
Song of India went above and beyond with delicious food and excellent service to make my mum's birthday a memorable one! Thank you Song of India for the food, cake and most importantly, giving us all such a wonderful memory (
5
From the music to the lighting, to the art on the walls, creating a fine dining atmosphere is all about the details. The waiter who served us was definitely very well experienced and knowledgable. He was able to explain and offer suggestions. Definitely one of the best authentic north indian food i have ever tasted
5
Impeccable service and good food. Lobster might be overwhelmed by all the spices which can be missed. Cod fish is fabulous. pricey but should be Michelin price
5
The service, ambiance and the food are excellent. Highly recommended to those who are looking for a quality Indian Cuisine.
5
We were given private room for 9 pax. Impressive service and great food with good quality.Very nice ambience too
4
Place is expensive and the food is ok. Didn't care much for the appetizers. The cottage cheese appetizers were ok. Main course - dal and rice - was palatable
5
Highly recommended restaurant, food and service are of high standards. I am impressed by the restaurant staff who were very professional, well organized and and adaptable. Special thanks to Justin for making sure our dinning experience was a very pleasant one.
5
We had real ‘journey through India’, it was a culinary delight to sample the best Indian food in Singapore. The service is personalised and we loved the hospitality and the way our comfort was taken care of. A must try experience
5
My wife and I had dinner there last week and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The staff were attentive and made us feel very welcome. They gave us good recommendations on dishes to order. The kebab platter (for starters) was phenomenal and the vegetarian dishes were creative. We didn't have room for dessert this time around, but will be sure to try it on our next visit
5
This was our first visit to Song of India. We were celebrating our Anniversary and the entire staff, especially Prasad, went out of their way to make it a memorable experience for us. The food was delicious with the right blend of spices, and the service very personalised. The complimentary dessert cake with a candle was a great touch. Would definitely recommend the restaurant 
3
We invited about 5 friends along with their families to the cosy, homely surroundings of The Song of India. We all had a great time in the dimly-lit ambience. Veg sheekh kababs were phenomenal. Veg dishes need a review. Breads need to be in variety. Saw many impressive non-veg dishes. We would have preferred 'Welcome drinks' and even if tiny birthday cake / muffins or cupcake from the restaurant. Our servers did a great job in capturing our great moment for which we are thankful to them. I also felt that 2.30 hours were less to enjoy all the goodies. I great, lush green, comforting landscape though, felt like home.
5
We had an amazing dinner at the song of India last night. The service was top notch and our server Prasad was attentive and made the night very special. We will definitely be going back.
4
We visited this place last week for Our anniversary celebration.food was awesome so delicious nice ambiance... good service Nd friendly staff... overall good experience...I suggest to visit once in The song of India ... surely u will visit again and agai

Celebrated my mother's 62nd birthday at The Song Of India on 8th December. It is indeed a pleasure to write a compliment for the entire team working at this restaurant. We were warmly welcomed at the nostalgic colonial house ( 33 Scotts road) which is where the restaurant is situated in. Great sitting area by the window and there was generous space for us. The special mention is for Mr Rohit who waited at our table. My mother was feeling extremely cold, and he immediately got a beautiful shawl for her so that she could keep herself warm. That was extremely kind and thoughtful of Mr Rohit. Right from the appetizers to desserts, he recommended the tastiest dishes that had certainly whetted our appetite. We ordered the Malabar Fish Curry, Chettinadu Prawn Curry, Steamed Basmati Rice, Saffron and Sesame seed Tandoori Naan, Tandoori chicken, Rasmalai and Masala tea. Food was exceptionally fresh and rich in flavour. Glasses of water were refilled without even us requesting it. Not just the water, we could go for a generous second round of helping if we wanted, as the plates are refillable. Rohit and staff ensured we were satisfied with each course of our meal served to us. Top-notch standards of hygiene warmed clean plates and cutlery, and impeccable service rendered by Rohit and the entire team. In fact, all I did was to inform them it was my mother's birthday, and they surprised with one of the most delicious chocolate cake slices we have ever eaten. They also took a photograph of my mother and I and gave us the complimentary printed photograph as a remembrance. thought that was truly a wonderful surprise and I thank them for making my mother's birthday a memorable one. A million stars for the excellent service. Outstanding and heartfelt. Each staff is working hard to go the extra mile just so we guests could have the best time and comfortably enjoy a sumptuous meal. This is truly customer service and The Song of India is perfectly exemplary for the rest of the service industries in Singapore. I had a fabulous time with my mother. Thank you, Song of India for pampering my mother like a Queen. I am so very delighted and appreciate from the depths of heart for every gesture you have taken to put a smile on both of our faces. A million stars for your top-notch service quality! Keep up the excellent work

Booked by family member in advance for a birthday celebration for a party of four.Restaurant cancelled booking for a bigger party.Very disappointed as was looking forward to a Michelin star Indian
4
I am definitely coming back to Singapore - if only to return to The Song of India restaurant I was invited here by a colleague and the dinner was FAB-U-LOUS!Previously I noted on trip advisor that Ushna in UAE was one of my top favourites in the world - Different in style but authentic in cuisine and attentive in service is the Song of India in Singapore . The food is delicious - even divine! The lobster is to be highly commended in particular. The kulfi and fruits in amongst the desserts were superb.A good wine list accompanies a brilliant menu. Service standards are very polished and high - attention to detail clearly permeates the place and the team  Well done Song of India team - first class!I will be coming back! Thank you ...........
5
It was a great experience in this restaurant. With good ambiance and Good Service by Prasad.Food is good here. We visit from Dubai to eat food here,And prasad not Disappoint us.We will visit again with our friends

I have dined in the restaurant way before it was awarded with one Michelin Star, the foods then were superbly prepared and presented, giving you the sight and taste experience you canâ€™t find it in other Indian restaurants. Prices then were also reasonable thus giving you the feeling of value for money. This time round, the restaurant ambience is by enlarge still the same, noticeable difference is there are a lot more serving staff then before. While most staff are friendly and always served with a smile, the captains look stern and serious. As we have a party of 5, I thought it might take a long time to go ala carte, we then took the recommendation to try out their best selling set dinner - Journey Through India (Non Veg). See pictures enclosed.Potato ball and Papadom served with 3 different sauces were very nice to kick start the dinner. The sweet and mint sauce really go very well with the papadom and we even ask the staff for more. Next come the soup - tempered Chicken and Almond soup with the herbal crouton was something none of us have tasted before. Never expected almond to go so well with chicken soup, this means the chef really knows what he is cooking. After the soup we were presented with another surprise- mustard enhanced smoked salmon and tandoori chicken served with mint chutney. I must say mustard enhanced salmon is really something new to many of us, and especially it tastes really good. Tandoori chicken was common but i find it lacks the char and smoky flavor. This dish can be done better in my view. To cleanse our palate and taste buds before the main course is served, lime sorbet were served. This is yet another best sorbet we have ever tasted. Whatâ€™s really good is that the sorbet is sweet and sour well balanced, thus giving you that very refreshing taste. The grand finale of the set dinner is the main course - The Art Platter which consists of Malabar Prawn Curry, Bhuna Lamb Ghosht, Dumpukht Chicken in Potli Masala, Garlic enhanced Spinach & Cottage Cheese, Black Lentil Delicacy accompanied with Saffron Basmati Rice, Yoghurt Relish, and mixed Naans. Before we start, we were passionately reminded by our waiter that all the dishes in the art platter are refillable should we require more helping. This kind gesture means a lot to those big eater, for us we can only appreciate the kind thoughts that restaurant has put in place. In the main course, all dishes were nice except the prawns which I find it over cooked and donâ€™t really look very fresh. Naans were the best to go with all the different curry sauces as well as the spinach and cottage cheese. Lamb was well cooked, soft but still juicy, similarly for the chicken too. The only setback of this set dinner is that you are likely to over eat cause the portion is more than enough for any Asian men and women. To close the diner party, we have masala tea, Alphonso Mango Kulfi, Gular Jamun and fresh fruits. Gular Jamun is well known for its sweetness, Mango kulfi became the star choice for the dessert category. Masala tea was not as expected as it lacks the cardamom and cuminâ€™s fragrance that we like, and I hope the restaurant management would read my review here and ponder upon why a simple masala chai in an Indian restaurant was not prepared well. To me, masala tea is to sum up the whole dinner, and the lacks of the spice fragrance can spoil the whole dinner which I hope the management will take a serous position to improve on. In order to be the best and well treasured, you just have to make sure no stone is left unturned, attention to details is the key.
4
The buffet lunch offered a good variety of different dishes and it was value for money. The freshly made naans were a nice touch. The drinks however were not very impressive for the price. The masala tea which was extremely dilute and tasteless and the lime juice was a tad too salty. The mango lassi was an exception and was really good. The service was impressive because our server , prasadh, took very good care of us and even surprised the birthday girl with a cake and a photo print out at the end of the meal. This was very thoughtful and a nice touch to our visit.
5
We ordered: cod fish appetizer, butter chicken, paneer, lobster and garlic naan. Food was 11/10. Highly recommend cod fish. Naan was the most amazing naan we had even eaten. However we may have ordered a bit too much - two mains and one appetizer is sufficient for two people. Ambience was great, perfect for date night or small groups. But, the best part of our experience was the service. The waiters were extremely helpful in recommending food, as it was our first time at this restaurant and we do not eat indian food often. They came to check on the food occasionally, and we're extremely pleasant and well-mannered. Very professional at what they do. :) We had a fantastic experience and will definitely be back!
4
My friends booked this restaurant to celebrate my birthday. A bit far from the MRT, but has great ambience and nice lighting. Ordered a la carte and the portion is very generous. Non veg and veg platter was very tasty and i loved the palak paneer. The best part is that they gave us free cake and even took a picture and made it into a card. Wonderful experience, will come again!
5
Celebrated my wife's birthday here and we tried the Journey Through India set and we were not disappointed. The food was excellent and the service was impeccable. We enjoyed what was served. The simple and everyday cuisines like naan was especially well made and delicious.We would like to give a shout out to our waiter, Rohit, who talked us through most of our meals and have been very attentive and informative. He is very good and really helped with our dining experience
5
Been there a few times and always enjoyed the food and service. Was there on the anniversary of my 1st date with my girlfriend and the staff found out about it and surprised us with a special desert and got a photo for the occasion too. Their buffet at lunch is real value for money and its a Michelin Star restaurant mind you
5
Had lunch at the Song of India - what a wonderful experience. It has a Michelin starred chef and the fare served is outstanding. The food is authentically Indian (unlike in many places outside India) - very well prepared and served with a finesse. The Dum Biryani and the Mutton Curry was specially outstanding !!!It is a select eatery, very well maintained and staffed
4
Celebrated my husbandâ€™s birthday at the restaurant, the staff were very kind and the food was great. A lovely experienc
5
We ordered from Ala cart menu. Food is excellent, especially the Saffron rice. Service is also good
5
This Michelin star restaurant is located out of Little India in a Black and White Bungalow on Scott Road. The image is one of high quality and the food did not disappoint.My host had only been for buffet lunches so the waiter helped us with the quantity of our choices.The menu is a vegetarian's delight. We had one traditional vegetarian appetizer , a samosa and a signature, modern appetizer, Vilayti Seekh, a delicious broccoli pineapple combination, a little too hot for my taste, having not had a real Indian meal in two years. Our main course was a vegetarian biryani
5
Excellent food, service, and atmosphere. Will definitely return on my next visit to Singapore. First rate
4
It was nice that they had prepared a small cake for my dad upon my request when i booked the restaurant. They had also taken a photo and printed it out to give us. It was a nice memento to bring home =

I recently celebrated my birthday dinner with family at The Song of India. I must say that Chef Manju Mural never ceases to amaze with his fabulous and creative yet with a lingering taste of authenticity that brings back the memories from childhood and homeland. The ambiance was very welcoming and food was exquisite. My Indian~Chinese family enjoyed the cuisine to the max. Chef Manju had carefully selected the menu and flow of dishes was very apt and complementing. It would have been a flawless evening should the service had been a little more attentive and punctual. There is room for improvement and make the experience at Song Of India most memorable
5
The song of India definitely lives up to its name. It's a beautiful restaurant with friendly staff and great food. I've been here on two occasions and I must say that it's definitely worth a visit.On my first visit I chose to go for the buffet, and during the second visit I went for A la carte, and I must say that the portions are impressive, I ordered chicken tikka masala and prawn biryani;Everything was delicious and two people could easily share and be satisfied. The staff are very friendly, from the lovely lady at the front door to my favourite waiter Gangan, on both occasions he was very helpful and willing to give suggestions. If you are in Singapore and want quality Indian food,this is the place to go
5
I wanted to treat my Father to Michelin Star Indian food on his birthday and what better choice than The Song of India! Excellent food. Great service, especially Mr.Durga Prasad who took great care of us. We also had a surprise birthday desert which simply made our day even better! They truly deserve a welcome for the great ambience and food. Food - 3.5/5Service - 5/5Ambience - 4/5Overall - 4/5 Only negative about this entire experience is the control over customers and keen watch on the buffet cutleries. We are vegetarians, but some other customers, not sure whether they were rushing or were in lack of serving spoons, used the serving items on the vegetarian section to scoop up non veg food, and placed them back in the vegetarian food as well. This is very wrong and I hope the staff there would hold stricter measures for it, at least keep watch on their customers while plating food. The problem was immediately rectified once I informed. So ! Just a personal preference: please do serve the starters with choice of sauces to go with them. And also serve them hot, because both our servings were cold .Thank you for this wonderful experience

I happened to be here on two occasions a few weeks apart in Oct -Nov.In Oct I went with my family for the buffet lunch at The Song of India and it was indeed a good experience. The service was great, the spread was excellent, the tandoor based starters were yummy and served very promptly. There were different naan-roti bread options and they were nice too. The overall ambience was impressive. The price for this lunch buffet was a reasonable 50++ /person.In early November, I went for a dinner at the same place this time as a group of around 20 people from my workplace ( majority of them were non-Indians, but with good taste for Indian food). We go out on such dinners once every 3-4 months, and try to change cuisine and venue each time. Sadly, I have to admit that everyone in the group and myself unanimously concluded that dinner at 'The Song of India' was the worse we had in Singapore over last 7 years!. The menu selected was apparently a 'Chef's special'. It was supposed to be a fine dining with set menu. However, there was nothing fine about the whole experience. The 'dinner ware' were shabbier than Kopitiam plates/ glasses. So called 'silver-ware' /'bone china' were sorely missing! There was even a shortage of tissues/ napkins (can t get shoddier!). Food was pathetic in taste. Samosas and a mini chaat was served in the beginning, that was obviously fried in 'rancid oil' from the ugly aftertaste it left in the mouth and I kept burping for next 24 hours.The chaat was served in spoon ( to mention the volume).If the taste was wanting in every aspect, the volume of servings were further pathetic! For eg only curry served was 'one ounce' (measured proportions) in a small beaker shaped glassware. On the name of biryani they served two spoons of dried shriveled colored rice! And we had paid a princely 130$/person for this horrible experience

We were visiting from NZ & went here based on reviews. Exceeded our expectations, excellent food & service. Gagan & the team were so welcoming and friendly that the entire experience was memorable. Will definitely visit again next time we are in Singapore. 10/1
4
The restaurant is located in one of those colonial black and white bungalows which was quaint and beautiful. The service staff were very friendly and explained all the dishes to us. Enjoyed our evening here overall.
5
We have been here several times and we keep coming back! By now we have tried pretty much all the vegetarian dishes that they have... But they regularly change the menu now and then and we got good surprises every time. Best dishes in our opinion : palak paneer, Rajasthani potatoes, paneer Tikka and their kerala appam dish. Also they have the best tandoori rotis we have ever tasted!!! Service quality depends on the person you get...

Their freshly prepared Naan is my favorite. The staff were friendly and attentive. Will go back! Value for $

Singapore is a vibrant culinary hub, and has numerous dining options for its diverse cosmopolitan residents. Whilst visiting this city, I had a confirmed visit on my itinerary to the Song of India. The fact that it’s the first Indian restaurant in SE Asia to have been awarded a Michelin enticed me to get there. Somewhere amidst the skyscrapers , and other commercial buildings, there opens gates to a quaint palatial place on one of the busiest lanes in the city. The Song of India is a beautiful restaurant. Invokes the Indian vibes and essence with its ambiance of typical colloquial architecture. Chef Manjunath Mural, the executive chef and curator of the restaurant is a humble passionate chef. They create renditions to classic Indian dishes which appeals to the global palette. What we now term as ‘Modern Indian’. When there’s a rendition , or a personal take on any classic, there are more chances of tampering the authenticity than recreating it; I was quite surprised and delighted to have experienced the difference at Song of India. The chefs dish up the classic dishes retaining its original flavours , and concentrate on creating the difference with its presentation. This certainly makes it easier for anyone to eat the dish and enjoy its true flavours. A must visit in Singapore for all of you who’d like to relish Indian cuisine !

I have our mommies luncheon there as one of my friend recommended this place. It turned out more than what we have expected. The food is good, ambience and service is fantastic. Durga Prasad and his team are superb. We would recommended this place anytime.
4
Great food,great service, great ambience.. ingredients for a delightful lunchCalling out Gagan especially for his personal service. Keep the great work
5
First time trying Indian fine dining.Great food, great ambience, great service, great experience
5
We went to this restaurant as part of the Eat Singapore book. We were not disappointed. Some of the best Indian food we have tasted and deserves the Michelin Star! Our waiter Prasad was fantastic and always ensured everything was ok. We would recommend going there to anyone!
4
I very much enjoyed our meal. Multi course set. Sophisticated spice pallet and not too much "in your face" so to say. Very good service. Very nice experience. Though if the up-charge from other top Indian places is justified is up to the individual.
5
Great food with very nice presentation and generous portion. Very good and friendly service and a Very nice atmosphere. Will definitely come back.
4
The exterior and interior of the restaurant is very nice and makes a good backdrop for photos. The food is also very tasty but overpriced. While the wait staff are friendly and helpful, we're not too pleased because they're not too attentive as we had to request for refill of drinking water a few times. They also brought out wine glasses that were wet. When we asked them about it, they said that the "glasses were kept in the fridge and it was water from condensation" but we were not convinced. I know what a frosted glass looks like and this definitely looks like it was just washed, not chilled. Even if it was just washed, we'd be fine with it but for such a posh restaurant, they should dry the glasses before serving.While we were there, an unfortunate incident occurred. The toilet's side panel of the sink fell apart and dropped on my sister-in-law's foot, which caused her toe to immediately swell. The restaurant assisted with an ice-bag and also paid for the full cost of the hospital bill so that was very professionally and properly taken care of
4
Ambience is really nice. Buffet is worth trying in terms of taste and variety but, itâ€™s quite Overpriced. Service is okay (not great). Check it out only if you have coupon or promotion
5
We came here for our anniversary. The ambience was really good. Staffs are really nice and the service is excellent.Definitely a must try
4
We came here for our 4th anniversary celebration and our experience was really good.Ambience was okay but the staff service, food quality and presentation was amazing.Must try is avadhi seek kebabs and alphonso mango kulfi
5
A great place for trying fine dining Indian cuisine. The buffet lunch is delicious and worth the money. The service and environment is also high level. I'll definitely come again
4
A very good meal at a reasonable price. Definitely one of the top Indian fine dining restaurants in Singapore.
5
Been wanting to try The Song of India as it's helmed by Michelin starred Chef Manju. Heard so many good reviews about this place. Finally decided to go with my friend for her birthday celebration. First thing first, the food is so beautifully presented and it's a total different experiences for myself and friend. I'm a big fan of Indian food but this gives me a whole new different perception. Also the service team is so attentive and good, I'm impressed. The atmosphere is also much cosy and nice, I would recommend for all types of gathering and celebration
5
An excellent Indian experience in Singapore - different from the usual fare - well presented and tastefully done. Service is superb and it’s a strong recommendation for anyone willing to try Indian food done modern.Try the set menus they’re quite substantial
2
Been wanted to try for long time before they got their 1 Michelin star.. took a long time as im not a big fan of indian food beside good prata or good nasi brayni...my thought is not necessary to go for their set menu..as too much for asian stomache..i think ala carte shd do just fine..but overall...i still feel tad disappointed
5
The restaurant is right beside a busy road, however once you enter it is almost like you entered a different world. Great ambience and even better food. Service was superb. Will definitely go back again. We spent about $400 for 6 people and we were all really full by the end of it
5
The food was delicious, especially the dal ma dumpukht makhni. The starter that we ordered, kothimbir wadi was also tasty and presented beautifully. In addition, we are also lucky to get an excellent service from Mr. Gagan.
5
I've been to The Song of India three times. I've actually never dined A-la-carte here but had the Sunday Family Brunch buffet a couple of times and the Diwali Set Meal once. The diwali meal was absolutely fantastic. The Sunday brunch is value for money and child friendly with lots of options. What i like best about this place is that the food is from around India and not just from one part of India as is the case with most Indian restaurants. The live counter during Sunday Brunch is fun for the kids. The buffet is quite varied with plenty of snacks, curries, salads and desserts. TSOI is really creative with the dishes and the presentation. And whatever meal you have, the restaurant has tons of vegetarian options too
5
My husband had booked the Sunday Brunch @TSOI for our 10th anniversary. This was the first time for us in the restaurant.We were welcomed, greeted and wished for our personal milestone by the friendly staff. The food was awesome - good spread, great taste, friendly service. Our kids enjoyed the food as well - from starters to dessert.Finally to our surprise, they gave us a complementary beautiful and yummy chocolate cake to mark our anniversary. They promptly took a picture and printed off a momento with our photo on it.Overall a great experience. Would like to visit again with friends & family
4
Great selection of classical Indian dishes all prepared with respect to the cuisine and with fantastic flavour and balance. They also have a delightful Mango lassi and service is good. Only weak point is the lackluster selection and quality of desserts
4
It was my wife birthday and when we entered the staff welcome her wishing Happy birthday. Food was nice and rich of different sauce and spices from indian tradition. I just didn't like some "small" details: one of the wine glass at the table got a stain, the Riesling i ordered by glass before my red wine, was not perfectly chill and the decanter was not properly dry off. Overall a great dinner for me and my wife. I will be back. Good service by Justin
4
Absolutely enjoyed our first experience at Song of India.Food: We had a smattering of vegetarian items (Pani Puri, Rajasthani Potato Fennel, Palak Paneer, Naan) which were all individually very good. Folks had the non-vegetarian Mutton Biryani and Goan Fishy Curry (Must try, amazingly tender with an exotic blend of spices)Ambience: Very classy and authentic, located along the posh Scott's Road. Music would have been a good addition.Service: Fantastic. 5/5. Both Mr Justin and Mr Gagan whom I presume to be Manager/Waiter paid good attention to the family and even presented us with a birthday dessert and a complimentary family photo. Small touches like these make a dinner experience all the more memorable.Definitely returning with my non-indian friends to show them a wider breath of Indian Cuisine
4
We went to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. The staff made it special. On the food front the taste of food was good but I have eaten more tastier foods
5
Friendly staff members with splendid presentation of dishes and great taste for indian tastebuds. Remarkable dining experience at Song of India with a few surprises .Great place for special occasion
4
Booked through American Express. Got a PDR, nice location and service. Food was modern Indian which was a nice change. I thought the marination was quite heavy . A good place to visit 
5
Situated on Scotts road, its a short walk from either orchard or newton mrt. Nestled in the conservation houses along the road, it is a fine dining restaurantThe food is tasty. They serve buffet during lunch hours and the price of buffet had been increased to $36 from the previous $38/ person excl of taxes. But they have increased the varieties they serve... definitely worth the moneyDinners are usually ala carte or set menu. The food is amazing, deserving of a michelin star restaurant. Nice cozy ambience and very friendly staffThy would be more than happy to explain the dishes you are about to eat, and even recomnend the best they have to offerExpensive as its fine dining, but worth to make your special day special with your loved ones..
4
I dined here with some friends. We decided to test some classic indian food and also some signature dishes.All was really delicious. The curry dishes have been really a caleidoscopi of taste and flavors with really balanced taste.The restaurant is a very nice area in an elegant colonial building. The main room is also very well decorated and the service is friendly and helpful.Price: around 100 Sing Dollar each ordering a la carte
5
High quality, genuinely warm service, with waiters who have a genuine understanding of the menu and wine pairing.The food is exceptional, not too heavy (for Indian food), containing good quality innovation from the chef.The cost is fair given the quality, much more so than numerous restaurants in Singapore. We took the one of the set menus $109++ per person and it was certainly worth it, with two starters, a mid dinner sorbet, followed by an excellent main + desert.
4
Lovey ambience, topped with excellent service by Prasad. He introduced us to menu items and shared about what ingredients went into the food, and how it's prepared. As it's nearing Diwali, he also provided us complimentary desserts. Very thoughtful and warm gesture to guests of other races
5
Superb food and ambiance. We visited for lunch with about 9 or 10 friends including a small child. Food was superb and service beyond excellent. Thank you so much Chef.
5
We came early September for our farewell brunch and had one of the most delicious brunch we could imagine. The range of curry variety were amazing, especially the mango curry (as it was the Alfonso mango season)! Chef Mural, the executive Chef from the Song of India greeted. He is one of the most kind hearted, humble Michelin star Chef around. We ordered butter chicken and the cheese naan from a la carte menu, absolutely memorable
5
This was my 2nd time at Songs of India. The dishes are awesome and worth the price. Prasad is excellent, he took great care of us with recommendations and service. Thanks, will go again!
3
Went there because my son said is 1 Michelin star. I have eaten better and far cheaper food than this. I would not recommend unless you want to pay for ambience.
5
This is a great restaurant in a wonderful colonial building with a great atmosphere. I'd recommend it for couples or if you are staying at the Sheraton Towers.
5
i have been here 3 times so far first time was in april this year for my wife birthday. it was weekday, the place hardly had anyone could be due to the accessibility. but it was our benefit so it was very quiet and we almost had the place to ourselves. we took the buffet which was 39.9++ food was good. the starters and the breads are made fresh to order. i am a big fan of dum briyani that day it was mutton i enjoyed. my wife has a sweet tooth and dessert spread though not elaborate it was adequate for Indian restaurant.Second time ; based the above experience, recommended a friend this place a party venue, charges was exorbitant at 60++, food beyond our worst nightmare, felt it was from a different kitchen altogether. They had the party hall booked next door .. i didn't factor this experience in my rating..third time was this sep for our anniversary. and its as a sunday.. it was great experience from start to end.. to being with our last kid a hyper active toddler fell asleep just in time. our other two kids and ourselves had a very peaceful meal.. starters were made to fresh again and was customised as requested. the staff was very kind and knowledgable and attentive. the live station was not so great, i was expecting different kind of food but it was pizzas made in indian style.. but kids loved it.. it went uphill from here with he main course in the buffet we really loved the prawn dum briyani it was tender and juicy prawn, still i wonder how they managed to cook the prawn soft and tender while cooking so long in the briyani.. we wanted to check the recipe! the curries were nice and had different flavours , most buffets have different curries but all with same bland flavours.. each had different level of spice / sourness etc.. chihcken gravey was nice. vegetarian items esp the eggplant in tomato was fresh and nice.. deserts were awesome the gulab jamoon was hot and tasted really fresh soft till the center. had a spread of kaju and other fruits and shot glass deserts two of which were nice one was average.. at this point were fully stuffed and were not able to move. and requested for check but the waiter came asked us to wait couple of more minutes we were puzzled... and this was the highlight of the day he brought a small house made two layer chocolate mousse cake .. it was so soft buttery sweet chocolaty .. My elder daughter who loves this waited 15 mins to make space and finish every last bit of it!! only gripe would be the price had gone up to 46++ from 39++... but i have not seen this level of service in many Indian restaurants esp in a buffet.. So i would highly recommend this place for any occasions . btw on sunday there was some offers for kids and they eat free with paying adults

The concierge at our hotel recommended this wonderful restaurant which is set in a historic building. On booking we were advised that the air conditioning was malfunctioning which added weight to our wanting very much to go. I cannot understand why people want Artic temperatures in the Tropics!! The ceiling fans, as well as performing their primary function added significantly to the ambience of the dining room. As this review is some months after the event, I cannot recall all the dishes we sampled but can offer this advice. Be guided by your waiter! We selected from the al la carte menu but were so keen to try as many of the dishes as possible we over-ordered. Unfortunately I cannot remember the title of the best dish for me but I can certainly remember the flavour and texture and overall yumminess. Stuffed and marinated paneer. Absolute bliss.Our waiters were very helpful and unobtrusive and genuinely delighted to welcome travellers. I strongly recommend business and leisure travellers, especially those from the UK to Singapore to try this excellent establishment
5
The cod fish starter is highly recommended. Food were good and the portion was generous. Service staff were very attentive. We were served by a friendly staff, Gagan. He was very knowledgable and explained every single dishes to us. Chef Mural himself even came out to greet us and asked for feedback. We will definitely come back for more!
2
the taste and quality of the food is no way closer to the cost. definitely not worth the cost. just 3 dishes buffet with very limited options for main course costs around s$43 pp (including ++). Definetely not worth. The waiters are rushing to close the buffet even before the closure
5
Great dining experience. Staff were very friendly and ready to recommend food and pairing with wine or sauces available. Naan was very nice and fluffy. Also, the appetizers were fantastic, really interesting way of presenting and packaging of the food. Curry was fresh with succulent fish served
5
Awesome Food and very welcoming staff.Surely a value for money.Complementary cake on my birthday too was cool..
5
Overall experience was great. Will definitely recommend to friends. And will visit again. Thanks to all the service staff
5
We were here to celebrate my husband birthday. We are vegetarian and enjoy Indian vegetarian food, so we picked SOL for a change. Service was great, we were greeted the moment we stepped in; drinks and food were served timely. When we were not sure about menu, they would explain to us and made suggestions. A male attendant we met during this visit is called Gagan. Decent vegetarian menu. However there were only 2 of us, so we ordered Palak Paneer, Biryani, Kofta and butter naan. Drinks are mango lassi. All food are great, drinks a bit too sweet to our liking but it was good. Restaurant interior is kind of from the last century, but maintenance was good. At the end of the meal, we had a slice of birthday cake (on the house), and they also helped us take a picture and printed out a copy for us. Good touch. We would like to visit again for sure. 
5
It was an amazing experience... both food and hospitality is simply best and perfect place to hangout... its my second visit with my bae to celebrate our anniversary and it was so special and we dint expect it to be so... chef mural thank you very much for the surprise and making our day memorable... we enjoyed our day!
1
I have to say what a shocking state of affairs... we have gone back after a few months... we were seated for 20 minutes before wine glasses were brought to the table .... while the food is alright it seemed to be overly in favour of food coloring ... Significant effort has been taken to remove the customer from "customer service". I have to say, the food was just inedible and while we went with a combination of guest that were Indians/ Pakistanis and brits / South Africans all agreed in unison that the food was just really bad!!!! It's very sad that the only Michelin star Indian food restaurant in Singapore which has so much multi ethnicity hasn't got this right. Will never go again... EVER!!!
4
Went there with business visitors from overseas. Choice, variety and quality of food was very good. Tasty but not to spicy for the guests (not used to Asian food). Service attentive without being obtrusive.Truly within the top ten Indian restaurants in Singapore and recommendable
5
If you want excellent North Indian food simply visit this outstanding restaurant. The service too is attentive and welcoming.
5
We had a lovely meal at Song of India last week to celebrate our son’s birthday. We have been to Song of India many times in the past and have never been disappointed. Song of India is one of our top choices in Singapore when we want to go for a special Indian meal. We are vegetarian and every item we chose was delightfully flavoured with attentive service and very good ambience. Chef Manjunath came by personally to enquire about the food and when he came to know that it was our son’s birthday, organized special candles and dessert for us. Thanks to all the staff and Chef Manjunath for a lovely evening
5
Pretty much composed, stylish with fascinating decor. Food is fabulous trust me. These guys cook with adherence to authenticity. The rich aromatic stuff I recommend is Awadhi biryani. I was served & taken care by a guy named Gagan, truly he knows the art of sequencing the items in order. Much happy, wish to be there for wine and dine again. Last but not the least, Aussie Victorian Shiraz played a role in setting the mood while indulging the taste buds.  Love and best wishes from Mr & Mrs Sanyal, Auckland, NZ.
4
Me and friend went here for dinner, we had the "chef's tasting menu" and had a really good experience.The presentation of the food is very playful and not like anything else I have seen in an Indian restaurant before, really nice.The food itself is very tasteful and some of the dishes are pretty spicy as the should be.Staff was very friendly and helpful
5
One of the best Indian cuisine I've had in a long time. And no wonder it had won a Michelin star too. Next time I'll get a bigger group to go so that we can taste more of the other dishes. Thank you, Chef Mural for a memorable dinner
5
Had lunch there on Sunday with my wife and 2-year old. The food was excellent but what really stood out was the service. Prasad and his team did a great job
4
Located in a lovely old black and white bungalow just off Orchard Road. Ideal for a romantic night out with your sweetheart who hopefully isn't as moody as my one
5
Authentic Indian flavour, nice buffet spread with choices..and great selection of desserts...execllent ambience...
5
The food was awesome . The service by the staffs are commendable. They were knowledgeable on the menu and able to give us advise to cater to our taste bud as we were spoilt with choices with wide spread of food. The food was v tasty. The chef was humble and personally came up to various customers to check on the food quality. I'm really impressed with their service. A nice ambience for all occasions.
4
We order a set menu and the food are all very good from appetizer to dessert. The varieties of servings brings a full sense of flavors. We really enjoy our evening with the good ambiance and nice staffs of the restaurants. The foods and the experienced we had is worth it
4
The place is well designed but the main hit for the place is the staffs.They were attentive to us and took care of us the whole evening.Shout out to Bahti for being a good host to us. All the best
5
Buffet was 50++ for 2 pax, for 1 pax is 29.90++. There was limited but good variety of buffet items (about 6 non-veg and veg main dishes, soup, assortment of fruits, about 4 dessert items) Other than the displayed items, the buffet offers freshly cooked free flow tandoori grilled chicken/fish/veggie patty/cheese/naan, that you have to order from the waiters. The flavours were good and we enjoyed it in our group of 8. Other than food, The venue also had good atmosphere, and there was free parking onsite
5
Visited Song of India for bid farewell to my mom leaving back India. We tried the set menu. Food was awesome and so was service and ambience. Simply the best Indian food in singapore.
3
Good but can improve. Should have better ambience for a Michelin star restaurant. Food was okay. Need to have more options
3
2 of us had dinner the Song of india last friday. The ambiance of the place was good. Service was good. The 2 meat dish and 2 prata, beer , The deer meat was good and the gravy taste good, the chicken dish was nothing to rave about, at best average. The Aloo prata and other ulta prata was hopelessly bad...worst i ever had in singapore. The Beer was very pricey. $39 for meat dish was way too much and a prata cost 9-12$ - its a joke. We are in singapore not in Peru or Bolivia... best to stay away from here and try other places if you want to eat better indian food and ofcourse maybe at 30% of the price.Won't return for sure and won't recommend other
5
Hands dow the best Indian food I have eaten. Amazing pallet of flavors from several signature dishes. Excellent service from Presad and Justin and the dining room is really quite beautiful located within a unique old historic home. Specifically the lamb shank was exquisite. It fell off the bone and was pure joy. Definitely well worth the price and somewhere I highly recommend for a special occasion or to sample the best Indian dining in town.
5
I often eat Indian, but this place was mind blowing! Price was a little high, but well worth it! Justin and Prasad were great servers. Try the chicken paparkia tikka. Amazing stuff. I highly recommend this place
4
Visited the resataurant with the friends, though the ambience and location of the restaurant is good. Food i would say not great but yes quite decent. Must try once 
5
We had an awesome lunch. Service was excellent especially by Gagen who took care of us at our table. He sure not only surprised my mum but me too with a small cake. Thank u Gagen for bringing the extra smile on my mum face

While located in a beautiful colonial bungalow, the interiors of the restaurant are rather dated and tacky.When it comes to the food, the portions are incredibly tiny and very overpriced. We had gotten a fish curry, a prawn curry, and a flambÃ©e lamb. The standout dish was the lamb, which packed the most flavor and had a slightly larger portion. The fish was average at best in terms of taste, but there were only 5 pieces in a dish that costed $39. The prawn curry was disastrous. It was very bland with a weird aftertaste, and only came with 4 pieces of prawns costing $39. We had also ordered roti and naan, and like the other dishes, the portions were incredibly tiny. Fortunately, I had the The Platinum Card from American Express, which gave me a 50% discount. But even with the discount, we were still getting little bang for our buck as the portions were ridiculously tiny.Disregarding how overpriced the food was, the flavors Really fell flat overall; even the best dish was just above average. It truly bewilders me how they had been awarded a Michelin Star
4
The Song of India in Scotts Road is a fine Dining Indian restaurant. Services and food are excellent as expected from such establisment. Prices are on the high side as wel
5
I was there for the lunch buffet on 13.7.17. We were welcomed into a warm, cozy dining place. The ambience put us instantly at ease since it was such a hot day outside. The food was sumptuous & the table service rendered to us was excellent! Mr Gagan attended to our table & learning that it was my Mom's birthday, he brought a complimentary Chocolate Kulfi cake with a candle. We were so surprised & an instant picture was taken and passed to us as a memory keepsake. We had a lovely afternoon lunch at The Song Of India. Surely we will return again for another special occasion and recommend the same to anyone. Special thanks to Mr Gaga
5
I have been visited this restaurant several times and always consisitent. Consistent of providing us excellent food and excellent service. Deserve to maintain their 1 star Michelin. I always loved their cheese and garlic naan. It's really fresh. Their mango lassi and the vegetable yoghurt (i am not sure the exact name though). I have go there every lunch buffet, they have few choices bit enough for me to satisfy and made very full and happy. Kudos to you guys and keep up the good work! :
5
Will recommend the place to all my contacts. Must visit for good Indian food and customer satisfaction
5
This is my favourite go-to restaurant whenever I have a craving for a delicious spice-filled meal or to celebrate an occasion. Offering an authentic taste of the flavors from all covers of India, The Song of India offers a carefully put together menu which would please the most discerning of palates. The team here is truly outstanding and makes dining here such a pleasure, each and every time. Thank you for making the birthday celebration a memorable one last Saturday
5
There were four of us in our party and after nibbling on some lovely Kashmiri naan we just settled on some mains and rice. We had the flambe Leg of Lamb, Palak Paneer, Tandoori Smoked Aubergine and the Malabar Fish Curry. We thoroughly enjoyed the meals. The real surprise was the Palak Paneer which was some of the best I have ever tasted - full of delicate and complex flavours. The flambe leg was a great balance between heat and spiciness. It too was a winner. I am a big fan of smoky flavoured aubergine and this one did not disappoint. Glorious flavour. The service was attentive but not intrusive. I can see why this Indian restaurant achieved a Michelin star. Recommended
5
We had lunch here. Very relaxed. We ordered off the menu instead of having the buffet. We had the most wonderful Paneer Gulnar Tikka. Stunning.The best Tandoori Lobster of my life. This has a lot of different reviews but the food here is first rate. Equal to London in quality which is saying something. We loved it
5
We had great a time, had delicious food, enjoyed thorouhghly. We were worried a bit for our daughter's food choices before going to the restaurant. We were relaxed by seing our daughter enjoying her food
4
The vegetarian dishes were very tasty and made without too much oil. The people were very friendly and entertained our requests for photos without any fuss. Highly recommend this restaurant especially for special occasions.

I was here for dinner, upon walking in, the reception pretended to ask us if we had a reservation knowing fully well that the restaurant had just tables full, then took an inordinate amount of time filling up a form before proceeding to show us our table.which was very close to another couple of people, of course we could overhear their conversation as well, considering how much space was available they could have put us in a quiet spot. The decor the restaurant is very tacky and lacked good interior design, the same can be said about the cutlery as well.we ordered some soup ( which was served in a glass bowl?), some paprika chicken tandoori and some naans ( mushroom and saffron ) and a bowl of yoghurtAll the food we ate was quite substandard and didn't reflect the price we paid ( approx over a 100$ ), the yogurt arrived as if someone had scooped some out of a tub stored in the freezer and it just so heavy and thick and hardly palatable.I have had much better service and food in many Indian restaurants in Singapore which offer the same choice of food and better decor and charge a fraction of the price.This is definitely not Michelin quality by any stretch of imagination, highly avoidable.I regret coming here and will not visit again

I made a reservation to dine at Song of India, which owns a Michelin star, on Quandoo and received a confirmation email from Quandoo the morning I was scheduled to dine. However, when I arrived, the host told me the restaurant was closed for a private party--no apology, no offer of assistance, nothing--just a brushoff! This is unconscionable!!! Unfortunately, this is not the only time I have had an Indian restaurant in Southeast Asia refuse to honor a reservation--the same thing happened at Gaggan in Bangkok last year. What is it with these restaurateurs? Do they have any clue about how to keep diners happy (not least of all by at the very least honoring their reservations!). My advice--avoid this place--great as the food might seem from reviews, and definitely do NOT book using Quandoo
5
Had the lunch buffet on a Saturday. The waitstaff were very attentive and they refilled our water/offered to replenish the bread and appetizers so we never had to raise our hand to get their attention. Gagan was very friendly and explained to us how ras malai was made

On my most recent trip to Singapore I had the pleasure of having Dinner at The Song of India, I have always been a lover of Indian Food and when i found out that this venue had been awarded a Michelin Star I was keen to see what the food would be like. I started with the Jumbo Prawn stuffed with Spiced Crayfish - this was by far the standout dish for me, the prawn and crayfish we both soft and tender and had been cooked in a mild sauce it came with a selection of sauces dotted around the plate and every mouthful was excellent. I then had the Lucknavi Lamb Shanks and again I was more than impressed the shanks fell from the bone and the sauce was perfectly based in spices and aroma. Desserts were a modern interpretation of some classic Indian Street Food Desserts capped off with a Chai Ice Cream. I tip my hat to Chef Mural and his team for pushing the barriers of what we commonly know as Indian Cuisine
5
We were staying at the York Hotel in Orchard and on recommendation wandered on to The Song of India for dinner with our 2 kids. All I can say is that we went back a few more times in our week long stayâ€¦. It has to be one of the best Indian restaurants we have been to. We are from Australia and have been to many many Indian restaurants but The Song of India is a totally different experience. The food was fantastic, very delicious and extremely well presented. We had a mixed kebab platter straight out of the tandoor and all the meats were succulent and tasty. The main course was served in the most interesting dinnerware and was not only appealing to the eyes but extraordinarily delectable. The freshness of the food came through with every bite. The onion naan has to be the best naan we have eaten anywhere and naan is now a common thing around the world! The dessert (which we had every day!) was scrumptious and a must to try. I am not one to take to Indian restaurants in a hurry but this experience was something different. The staff were all very impressive with their quest for perfection coming through with every bite

Was Surprised by my Wife, who Brought me to song of india for my birthday dinner. The food there was Excellent. Gagan provided a great service. And was surprised With a cake and photo as a birthday gift. Will recommend it to my friends
5
Great food and ambience. Central seats are nice. We liked to celebrate our marriage anniversary there
5
Came for my wife's birthday. Food was excellent. Gagan provided a great service. They surprised with a cake and a photo to remember the occasion. Thank yo
5
Unlike most Indian restaurants , every dish was spiced/ flavored just right , not over powering ... attentive staff , excellent ambiance ... will definitely go again . Kulfi's were sublim
4
The non-vegetarian degustation menu was particularly enjoyable. Although the lobster moily was unavailable tonight, the entrees we had - chicken lazeez handi and tiger prawn done moily style respectively, were equally outstanding. Also noteworthy were the delicious pan seared foie gras with mango coriander chutney, really tender awadhi lamb kebab and refreshing Alphonso mango kulfi. Friendly service and not excessively priced for a fine dining experience. Still one of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore, and we highly recommend a visit!
4
Said to be the only restaurant serving Indian food with Michelin star rating, but unfortunately the experience is not any special. The decor is typical but not exceptional, the food was good but can't be rated extraordinary and service was average. We, a group of abou 12 Indians, went with a great expectation, had the set menu dinner. The servings were just simple and good traditional Indian delicacie
3
Was tempted to try them and see what had changed since they received the Michelin star. The location, ambience and service is pretty good but in terms of creativity in the food, presentation and taste I would say it isn't even the best Indian restaurant much less a Michelin star deserving on
5
It is good to try their buffet at least once (enough variety and tasty food!) If not, ala carte is also good but more expensive overall. service is attentive
4
After having a master class one month ago with chef Mural, we definitely wanted to try his restaurant. We went there for the lunch buffet and were well received by a well trained team.The dishes were as expected : subtle, not to heavy so we could try everything and left us craving for more! And the lentil pudding is evil, one I digged in I couldn't stop myself!You can also see them preparing the naan which is very cool.The chef remembered us and came to great us warmly, he's always so nice.We'll be back for sure if we come back to Singapore 
5
Food was excellent and awesome service as always especially by Mr.Gagan today . Been there for several times and every time we have a wonderful experience .
4
Convenient and free parking at restaurant itself. Good food and service! Waiter was thoughtful to recommended less spicy option
4
Chef Manjunath Mural, brings out the magic with his cuisine, presentation and the blend of flavours. Fantastic service and beautiful ambience if you are looking at dining for a special Occasion, business Lunch or Family Dinner !Highly recommend The Song of India
5
Absolutely the BEST Place for a great Indian cuisine in Singapore. We had been there for a private lunch meeting and it turned out to the best decision. The ambiance is truly Indian with some very good decor, the location just right and the service outstanding. The food was very tasty, very well presented and just the right quantity for a person to be satisfied. The afternoon had some nice soups, starters with lamb, paneer among others, Naan and other curry. Highly recommend to try the Chef's Kofta curry if you get a chance to meet Chef Mural (Only Michelin Starred Indian Chef in this part of the region). Overall highly recommended when in Singapore or want to have some great homely Indian food
5
We celebrated birthday party at song of India. The food was extra-ordinary. All the ingredients used are fresh and good quality. My family and I enjoyed very much. Mum was impressed by the cod fish and prawns. Thumbs up and will be back as the food and service are really good. Value for money.Thank you Chef Mural, you are great
5
I had lunch with some of my colleagues at this restaurant. The food was absolutely wonderful, the presentation was very pleasing. The atmosphere was very pleasant. The head Chef Mr.Manjunath Mural and the staffs are very friendly and took good care of us. We had a very good experience and we highly recommend it
5
We were at The Song of India to mark our Wedding Anniversary. We had made a reservation and were warmly greeted at the entrance. After settling down at our table in the nicely furnished interiors with lovely paintings, we decided to try the Vegetarian Tasting Platter for starters. The samosas, panner tikkas and kothimbir wadi made for a delicious beginning to our meal. We were absorbed in the aroma and tasty flavours of the main course of Amritsari Chana Masala and an exotic Green Subz Medley with tandoori roti, rumali roti and vegetable raita (yoghurt). We then had vanilla ice cream for dessert.Later, we were happy to hear from Chef Mural, who stopped by at our table, that the restaurant had earned a Michelin star last year. When he learnt that we were celebrating, the restuarant staff got busy and served us a special cake with a candle much to our surprise and we were overjoyed! A photo was taken and an instant souvenir card was presented to us. We thoroughly enjoyed the visit.We recommend this restaurant for all those who like to spend a lovely evening with family and friends at this restaurant! Let the restaurant know if you are celebrating any occasion and they will make it special for you
5
we had journey through india-non veg and it was very very memorable and plating was beautiful. Bhuna lamb ghost was succulent. the food is not very spicy which is welcome at the same time its full of flavors. The ambience allows you to relax and enjoy wine.Would highly recommend getting set menu was portions allow for an interesting variety of dishes
3
We went for the lunch buffet. The food was average at best. Not much flavor even though the food was fresh. The variety was not large. They did not refill the chafing dishes regularly so many went empty for a long period of time. I have had much better and outstanding Indian buffets for lunch in the U.S.A. The Michelin star is not deserved here
4
The food was great, we took the "tour of India". This gave better options for my wife (vegetarian). The beer was very (very) expensive (even by Singapore standards) at $14 for a small glass (half pint). This is out of order (it really is). Also their air conditioning, really works (I asked for it to be turned up but no real difference), so make sure you wear long sleeves or take a jacket and keep it on (I kid you not, had to go outside to get a heat). For two, eating the tour and drinking beer, we spent (inc service charge and tax) $360.
5
This is not the first time that I have visited the restaurant but it is the first time I am reviewing it. The fact that I return on a regular basis is perhaps the best example of a good restaurant.The options for good North Indian cuisine in Singapore are limited and the Song of India is a notable exception. The food tends to be authentic and the service is efficient while remaining inconspicuous. I would recommend the lunch buffet, where the choice is not extensive, but the food is delicious. In addition to the buffet, the staff will bring a plate of appetizers from the grill and serve it to you on the table. They do the same for the assorted Naan's and rotis and will serve it to you on your table

Me and my Wife have been visiting restaurants for 20 years, across Europe and throughout Asia and Australia.Last week we came to Songs of India for the first time with my in-laws and I'm not exaggerating but we WERE BLOWN AWAY by multiple things.1. Prasad and Veer - if you ever want to see and witness what *seamless team work* is, see them in action! The way they greet, always *yes* attitude, going beyond to bring a smile on the customers face...these folks are just outstanding. Even if something is wrong sometime, I can tell you the warmth with which they speak and do things, you will always be smiling throughout.I can only say that I wish every one in my team is equally *customer centric* and my business will grow faster automatically.To the management - these two stars are pillars of the restaurant and you must preserve them for Long!2. Food - its the MOST FINGER LICKING awesome food we have had ever had. To the extent we over-ate. The spices it had weren't heavy on the stomach and the genuine taste of home was coming out. We had veg kofta, tasting platter and dal...and boy it reminded me of everything what makes Indian cuisine special.I can guarantee that if you come here once you will be compelled to come here again! It's my guarantee....these folks are so good.3. Ambience - it is undoubtedly the easiest place to hang out! Whether it's a business meeting or a family outing, you'll be at ease throughout! Net net - once you come here for food, you'll come back for Food + Prasad + Veer. They have more to offer than food....and for me that's what *pure delightful customer experience* is.Kudos to the team which hired Veer and Prasad!In-face within a week, my wife wanted to go back...
4
Loved the food, Service was great. They should look into the air conditioning and adjust it accordingly
5
Superlative Indian cuisine. One of the best we have eaten. The lamb dum biryani, prawn curry, palak paneer and stuffed chillies were all super. The service staff were also very friendly and polite. Very good experience overall. Definitely worth a return trip.
4
Good food and excellent service . Was a bit on a the high price site but within reason. Ambiente is nice and I guess they went through a rennovation at some point. Great paintings and artwork.Overall - an enjoyable experience
5
Ambiance of the restaurant, kind of set the mood right as you step in. Since we were trying the restaurant for the first time, we went with Chef's suggestions. The guy who waited on us game some good suggestions for vegetarian food and we were glad that we tried it. Kothimbir vadi from their menu is a must try. Mile Jule Kofta, their signature dish is very good (if you are not a big fan of spicy side dishes). Kids enjoyed their Kashmiri Naan thoroughly and we went for Dum briyani. The course was completed with yummy kulfi.In all, we left the place with a gratified palates
4
Well, nothing to complain. But also nothing outstanding to compliment. It's like the same standards of Yantra and other Indian high-end restaurant lunch buffets. But service is more personalise here and less crowded.
5
We had a wonderful time at this amazing restaurant which has both great food and lovely ambience! The chef was kind enough to arrange for a quick cake when he got to know we were there for a birthday celebration! A must try for special occasions!!
4
I had the lunch buffet.The food was very good, especially the freshly baked naan. I loved the carrot and coriander soup a lot as well. The spread isn't as wide as most high-end buffets I'm used to, but there's enough variety to walk off satisfied and intrigued by what the restaurant has more to offer.At $29.90++, it was a pretty good meal that did not tear a hole in my wallet too.I can't wait to have another tasty Indian meal in that gorgeous dining room
5
I was impressed by the welcoming to their restaurant. We were seated comfortably and one steward approached us with a welcoming smile for taking food order. As it was our first visit gone with his advise. He suggested paneer dish with garlic naan & bhuna gosht a mutton dish. Floor manager was around and took care us very well. Service was quick , beverage met our expectation.Manager was keen customer satisfaction checked about their food atleast twice during our meal. All together we had a memorable experience. He bidded a pretty good farewell while we were leaving the restaurant. Thanks a ton!!
5
We have been going there for long for business lunches as well as Family dinners, always a great feeling . The staff is very friendly and sometimes you even get to meet and interact with the Great Chef himself. I have been there with my European, Indian and Chinese friends as well and most of them ask me to take them again to this Restaurant
2
Went there for lunch as a treat for the family attracted by its apparent Michelin star rating. Regrettably it did not come up to the expectations.Firstly, the person taking my reservation the previous day on the phone didn't sound welcoming or enthusiastic at all about the fact that I had chosen them over the others in the town. He sounded almost bored :(Upon reaching there, the reception desk was empty... while you don't particularly expect dancers at the welcome but you also don't expect having to wait at the door trying to attract attention by waving to the staff I could see strutting about inside from where I was standing. Finally we were ushered in by a decent person. And after checking out the buffet, which wasn't too appealing, we decided to go a la carte. The order placement was alright. And then after that you almost always expect some complimentary papad or some some munchings while waiting for the food to arrive... but nothing.The starters (paneer tikka and Poochka) came fortunately not too late and actually tasted good and were presented very good. So we thought that okay it appears they are making up finally. But that was not to be.The main course plates when they arrived - were not warm at all. Another bad. The main course items (namely Aloo Gobhi and Pindi chana) were totally bland and no better than what they serve in a so called 'Indian' restaurant in a really vague town in some east European country and not from a prestigious Indian restaurant in Singapore if this repute.The staff were dressed in at least 3 different uniforms- some Indian looking and some in white shirt and some in black shirts... not sure why. It just causes dissonance and does not make the diners feel that the restaurant has got their act together.After food, there were neither any wet towels nor any finger bowls offered. No one came to ask if we would like to order any desserts. This is a total no-no for any fine dining Indian restaurant worth its name. Good things: The butter chicken was good. The water glasses were getting refilled regularly. All in all, disappointed with the first and perhaps last visit here. If the management is reading this, you guys are missing a good opportunity- pls take this feedback and make amends.

Was there for our wedding avn. There was a cake n a card which took us by surprise ..We were very happy.
5
The experience was good. Overall ambience was excellent. Staff was friendly and maintained the Indian culture in singapore in very true sense
5
Song of India offers incredible Indian cuisines with authentic taste presented in contemporary style. Chef Mural is very talented and is maintaining a high standard of Indian cuisine through his creativity. Song of India offer a contemporary decor and a great embient with good service. I would highly recommend this restaurant to Indian food lovers. Chef Mural definitely deserves a Michelin star
5
The setting is a colonial bungalow and very cosy nestled around green plants right in the middle of Orchard / Newton shopping districts.We had a lovely Chicken Kadhai followed by delicious Gulab Jamun all curated by the wonderful chef - Manjunath Mural with whom we has a healthy conversation.I am sure to visit this restaurant open for having exotic Indian Foo
5
Best Indian food I have had in a long time. Worth every cent. Being of Indian origin, I have been to many many Indian restaurants but the warm hospitality and mouth watering food presented in an unusual, fascinating way tempted the taste-buds every time. Thanks Chef/Director Manju and Chef Jeetu for making our week in Singapore memorable. You can assured we will be there everytime we are in Singapor
2
We were taken here by some Singaporean friends. The building itself is a stunning old colonial home and it has been nicely preserved. The staff are warm and friendly. However, the food is another story. We were led to believe that it was a North Indian restaurant. This is not the case. There are menu items from all over India.Before bringing our dinner, we were presented with an amuse bouche which looked lovely. It turned out to be a potato ball. As my first bite, it was underwhelming. We were brought a basket of popadums. They had been fried all rolled up, and arrived as tubes. This affectation made them unnecessarily fussy to eat, crumbling into a pile as soon as you tried to break off a piece. Then our food arrived. We had a Goan fish curry, a chicken curry from I'm not sure where, a prawn curry, an aubergine purée and some daal. All of the curries were a dull grey and tasted, essentially, the same. That is to say, pretty bland. The aubergine purée was uninteresting and the daal was OK. For dessert I tried their ras malai. The milk dumplings were firm and average. No wow factor anywhere in the meal. Considering the glowing revues from others, I can only assume that the Singaporean palate is not a discerning one. There is so much better Indian food in town. Give this place a miss.
5
We tried the specially curated menu by chef Manju Mural for the WGS 2017, a themed dishes lined up from the street food from various parts and famous cities in India. As usual, Chef Manju worked his magic to create an unforgettable experience with his culinary skills. The food was exquisite, service was polite and pleasurable. It certainly tingled memories of growing up in India while enjoying those famous street dishes.I would highly recommend the Song of India and chef Manju's cooking.
5
Had a very pleasant time with great food and very friendly service(from Mr Gagan).Would love to visit the place again
5
Some of the best Indian food for sure. Creative setting and enjoyable food. Very pricey but worth the experience.

We decided to go out for a special dinner on our eight wedding anniversary. My wife did the booking. As soon as made our booking we got a call from the restaurant that the bookings are fully taken and they are not able to host us for dinner that night.So we decided to go for lunch on the subsequent day and the booking was confirmed. Once we entered the restaurant we were greeted warmly by one of the staff. We were given a 3-seater table to settle and we started our dining adventure. The food was really good special mention for the non-veg starters (chicken & fish) and the fast food starters. The butter naan were crispy like heaven and couldn't help my indulgence to complete the basket. The naan was well complemented by the hot and tasty butter chicken. The restaurant manager came up to our table and apologized for the cancellation of our reservation. The best was reserved for the last. We were surprised with a candle cake for us to celebrate our special moment. They also gave us a photograph souvenir as remembrance before we left. At the end it happened to be a memorable day indeed. We would recommend family dining to Song of India for special occasions
3
The menu was average. Especially the vegetarian section was limited and the food was a little bland for the Indian palate.I think they may be having a new chef on boar
4
Good food with lot of potential to improve interiors. I do not recommended for seating outside. I liked the surprise for my birthday. Gagan was excellent and served us well.
4
If you have never tried Indian fine cuisine, you need to visit The Song of India! It has a really nice colonial style ambience. The food is really good - rich in aroma and taste. The naan was delicious and i adored it. The waiter could have been a little more attentive in filling our glasses, as they had to be called quite often. The manager was great though, as he checked on us to make sure we are ok
5
We enjoyed our dinner at this restaurant. We visited this restaurant with family of 7 nuclei get teenage childrens. We are totally vegetarian and could get good options. The starters were fantastic. It is little bit expensive but worth it
2
Very ordinary food. Paneer was super dry and had no flavor. Service was not what one would expect in a michelin star restaurant. The design and decor of the restaurant is nice.Overall I would say this is an average place.
3
This restaurant is great for those not familiar with North Indian cuisine. We are two avid lovers of Indian cuisine, eating it numerous times a week. We came to this restaurant expecting a fantastic Indian meal, however all of the dishes were average in taste which was incredibly disappointing for the price. The service on the other hand was excellent
5
Having been to many Indian cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Pune, and Hyderabad. And also less frequented place like Jamnager, I have more than a fair share of all the nice regional tastes of Indian cuisine. However The Song of India took the best of Indian cooking and came up with creative dishes that brought up the unique taste of Indian food to a higher level. The Sarson Cod Tikka was done just right with juicy cod pieces with nice charred corners marinated with just the right amount of spices which was not overpowering the natural taste of the cod. Also had two other Indian vegetarian dishes. One was spiced mushrooms and the other was a mixed vegetables dish. Couldn't remember the name of the dishes but they were so good that we finished every last bit. Wanted to order more but that would be over eating. We will be back for more definitely
5
Chef Mural is constantly innovating and creating more visual appeal to Indian food...which is so great. We went here for their Sunday buffet and were seated in a lovely private room at the front of the house. Song of India is located in a gorgeous black and white house...thank goodness for not being in a mall!The buffet options were more than adequate and the appetizers consisted of kebabs that were beautifully presented. Hot, crisp naans were brought to the table to accompany our main course and the desserts were delicious- best gulab jamuns we've had in a while. A filling and satisfying sunday lunch! Would love to go back for dinner
5
Wow, I was impressed, by the service, the setup, the food and more. We felt so important and the waiters graciously attended to our every need, always with a smile. Space was immediately created for our baby's pram, without being asked.
4
I just visited The Song of India. The service was excellent. The staff were very professional. The food is 2nd to none. I am a big fan of Indian food. But This is the first Time trying out this restaurant. I must say that I am impressed. This us definitely a restaurant worth visiting...
5
I went for an early dinner with my girlfriend. The staff was really nice and friendly, even the chef himself asked for our opinion. And we liked it a lot. We had various pieces of meat which were all delicious. Definitely recommend the Song Of India if you are looking for great Indian dishes
3
Food was ok, location is nice, service was average, bill was excessive. I would not go back unfortunately
5
The food was really good. The chef and all the staff were very courteous and helpful and their service was very good.
5
Your restaurant has one of the best food I have ever tasted in my life.The restaurant has such a nice embienc
5
We have been regulars to The Song of India, for a few years now -- even before they were awarded the coveted Michelin Star..all I can say is they are growing from strength to strength.Be it customer focus - making a table available for last minute bookings, remembering you and taking care of your family's tastes and each time surpassing themselves with even better food - there has to be a secret mantra to consistently score above expectations!!The icing on the cake is Chef Mural - we have known him as a friend of the family, but, his humility, patience, ever smiling demeanor just makes it all the more worthwhile.There is not a single thing you wish to change and trust me, there is no exaggeration here. Chef Mural and his team are doing a fantastic job, ensuring Indian cuisine and its variety and subtlety shines and we only wish they grow from strength to strength
5
This restaurant recently got a michelin star so the quality has always been awesome during the several times we visited this place. It is a fine dining place and pricey, however it will leave you satisfied with the food, presentation and customer service.It tends to get very busy so book early for a good table. The tables at the center of the restaurant are more comfortable for families.We had vegetarian dishes and Chef Mural does a great job of mixing indian food from different states to create unique combinations. Not sure of the exact name, but I have attached some pictures of the curries we had. It was a tower of baked potatoes in a creamy sauce and it was very smooth on the tongue. Chef Mural takes care of the patrons of this restaurant so a visit to this place goes beyond just food
5
I was unfortunately late and arrived near the end of lunch service. The staff couldn't have been more accommodating, lamb curry was delicious with fresh nann bread. They even bought out additional items due to the buffet being nearly finished
3
First time here and likely not going back. It's located in a lovely black and white bungalow on Scotts Rd but the inside looks very gimmicky like a fake movie set. Service from start to end however was excellent with polite and attentive staff. The starters we ordered were quite tasty and no complaints. The mains on the other hand were very bland with no spice whatsoever. What was worse was the nearby air freshener spraying out a clean toilet smell every few minutes that prevented us from smelling anything else including the food.Wine list: lots of choice but unfortunately full with overpriced "supermarket" wines. For example, Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc for $125! Cape Mentelle for $90 I believe which is less than $40 in local supermarkets
5
This is my favourite Indian restaurant in Singapore! I visit about 2 times per week. If you haven't tried it, I'd recommend the lunch buffet from Monday to Saturday, as the price is reasonable as you get to try some of their creations. I'd recommend their sesame Naan, butter chicken, Mango Kulfi, and soups.The staff are very nice, Veer, the restaurant manager is great as well as the other waiters.
5
The ambiance of this place is awesome right from the time you walk in. The service was good and attentive.Being a Lamb fan I ordered Raan( which is a baby lamb dish). They brought it to my table and did a flambe next to my table which i thought was pretty impressive.I had the Nalli Ghost as well for the Main Course with Saffron Rice and it was a good combination along with the Blue Cheese Naan.The restaurant Recently received a Michelin Star and I feel they earned it alright
1
Out of sheer curiousity, my family decided to give The Song of India a go, and boy were we disappointed. I have never come across North Indian food that's so bland, and the spice level was so low that my kids were happy to lap up the Chicken Dum Bryani (which was the most tasteless Dum Bryani I've ever had). Sure, you can say that we got what we paid for at a Michelin Star restaurant; but do you think I'd even dare to throw good money down the drain if they can't even get a simple buffet done right?I'm sorry, but there are much better North Indian establishments out there that probably deserve the accolades
5
I was with a group having a business dinner. As well as being vegetarian I also do not like tomatoes! Having been pre-informed of my "quirks", the restaurant provided me with special options which catered to my dietary needs. The food was excellent quality, very tasty and beautifully presented. Service was unobtrusive. All in all a memorable meal during my stay in Singapore
4
If you are an Indian food lover then this place is a must visit. I visit there alone for dinner and was really amazed with the ambience, hospitality and food quality. Yellow daal and chick peas liked very much and of course the tomato soup. Overall very nice experince as a food love
5
I love travelling for food.My friend and I ate here on the Song of India on 6 March 2016 after we had heard that the food was great there. The restaurant has also been awarded a Michelin star.You can supplement the food with different and exciting cocktails from a drinks menu, for example the Pink Lady. I took one cocktail for each course. The first course was bread, naan and chapati alongside with a spicy trout. As a main, I had chosen the very hot scallops. The food tasted so good. I absolutely loved it and I fully understand why the Song of India was awarded the star.It is located inside an old colonial house just north of Orchard Road - it's best to take a taxi. The ambience was very good because we chose a weekday
4
Good place to impress on food, though pricey. Would recommend as service is good and staff are attentive
4
The food was lovely. Service was friendly. Great location. However I cannot justify the price - with little India just down the road I can get similar food for 20% of the price. Only worthwhile if you want a nice setting and attentive wait staff.
5
Authentic Indian Food, Finger Licking Taste @ Singapore... Must try would be Daal, Sarson Da Saag, Gulab Jamun...Ambience and service both are amazing..
5
We went to this restaurant on Valentine's day. From Interiors to service to food each and every aspect of this restaurant was just amazing. Must have "Palak Paneer" & "Gulab Jamun"!!!
4
Visited this restaurant on a business trip to Singapore rather than opting for one of the hotel options.Beautiful old colonial style cottage and a warm friendly reception. As my dinner colleague was Indian I let him do the menu driving and was rewarded with a set of beautiful veg and non veg taster and beautifully cooked mains.The blue cheese naan was extraordinary.
5
Excellent food, service and location in a very charming Black & White Bungalow! Thank you Chef Manjunath for your hospitality, we will definitely be back!
4
Visited this restaurent for business dinner with colleagues and customers. What a pleasant evening. The ambience of this restaurent, set in an old colonial bungalow is just what was required after a day of meetings. Atmosphere is good, the background music is exactly that, and also adds that classic Indian touch. I could not fault the service, the guys that waited our table we polite and attentive. So, to the heart of this review. I could not fault it from the presentation of the appetizers to the flavour of the sweets, everything was superb. Each dish nicely presented, tender meats and tasty vegetarian dishes. If you want to sample a slice of India, this restaurent is an excellent place to start. Price wise I can't comment as I didn't order and didn't pay
5
The place had great ambience and amazing presentation and service. Each course was creatively constructed and an overall wonderful experience.
5
Great authentic Indian food and a very good fine dining ambiance. The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing.Service was excellent. Overall, a very welcoming place. We highly recommend it

I have heard and read so much about Song of India and finally tried it. Came with my family and we certainly had quite a feast! From starters to the mains to desserts everything didn't disappoint. The cod was heavenly, butter chicken was smooth and flavorful and the nanns was the best we ever had. Every dish served was a delight. Will definitely come back again and try more dishes. Not to mention the serving staff were so attentive to details and Chef Manju is unbelievably humble, friendly with a great sense of humor.
5
From the welcoming st entrance to the end, every team member was professional and with good manner.Food was excellent and menu was nicely balance between vegetarian and non. Signature dishes were outstanding.Overall, it was excellent dinner experience
5
Being away from home, had one of the best Indian food in SG, at "The Song of India". The food was just too perfect - the spice, the flavour, the quantity and the overall experience. Had the honour to meet the Chef Manju and learn how following basic values in life leads to success. The staff provided great service and were happy!! My favourite was mutton seekh kabab!!

I would always prefer Song of India when it comes to dine with family or guests visiting Singapore.1 scenic location and classy ambiance .much much better venue than the usual Little India joints2 Michelin star and totally deserve visit by families3 great food, very Creative and delicious4 Equally great and humble service5 Family Friendly and even kids would love it6 Complete value for money7 great for family or corporate gatherings, lunches and dinners, small parties8 Indian cuisine but made it such a way that it suits all tastebuds. Indian International Cuisine I would say!9 menu keeps changing and since I have repeated my visits, can safely say that every time it is still the best!10 they have event hall as well

Had one of the best food ever here at Song of India. This restaurant never disappoint me and I always had a good time here. Have to try the awesome chicken tikka and the Mutton briyani. Great restaurant atmosphere and the staff provide very good service. Learn a lot from Prasad whom showered warm hospitality and food insights on their wide array of options available. Last but not least, he even offered a complimentary desert to end the experience on a delightful note

If this is a one star Michelin restaurant then I can only think the inspectors failed to go to most Indians in Singapore.Being nice I would say they are naive - or perhaps the fact that they are located in a lovely Black and White means they charge over the top for poor service and average food.You can get way better food and service in Little India or the Singapore Cricket Club.I really would suggest avoiding this place - go to Little India or the Cricket Club (need to go with a member).A really poor example of the Michelin mark...........

Had a buffet lunch with my wife this week. The place was not so crowded. Excellent food and service. Very good appetizers served at the table. Good variety. Every dish had its own signature recipe, unlike most buffet places. My favorite was Goan fish curry.They offer free parking. The service was good.The only thing they could change is to instruct the servers to handle cutlery without making noise, especially when they have diners in the restaurant. Otherwise an excellent experience. Would surely go back
5
Tasty, Classy , Creative ...and the list goes on."Song of India" is a must visit if you are looking to have authentic Indian food.The experience begins from the the time you enter the Colonial bungalow that hosts the Song of India ..the service from the attentive staff adds on to the experience , but it is the food which is the hero and rightly so. The amount of care Chef.Mural and his team has put in is evident in every single dish that comes to the table, the way the table has been organised and the attention they give the guest.I have been here a few times and each time the experience gets better. I think the Michelin Star is just a beginning , this restaurant will go places
5
This is by far the BEST Indian restaurant in Singapore and well deserving of its Michelin star. Went with a group of close friends to celebrate my birthday (first time visit) so no idea what to expect but was not let down. Decided on the 5 course set menu and EVERY single dish was unique, delicious and very creatively presented. Would definitely visit again and recommend to all friends and visitors who want to be treated with a unique experience. Service excellent and food excellent- the best combination
5
This place deserves its Michelin star. Set in an old colonial bungalow, visiting the place itself is a treat. The century old wooden column gates were impressive. There's a relaxing old world charm to the place. Service was excellent and the food was spot on. We had the lunch buffet which was tasty and good value. There was a live tandoori station. The stand out dish for me was the dum lamb biriyani. It surpasses the kid goat biriyani at Bismillah which is widely acknowledged as Singapore's best dum biriyani restaurant.
4
Nestled in a beautiful colonial black and white heritage bungalow along Scotts road, the location is central, convenience, lush garden with ample free parking. It casts old world charm right from the beginning. The interior is maharaja art nouveau style with a little bite of natural light. Table is neat and well-set. This is the only One-Michelin Indian Resturant in Singapore, and it has an incredible value-for-money buffet for S$40++. The spread features a wide selection from soup, fresh salad, starters, curry, tandoori, paneer, dal to traditional desserts. Plus live-station of 'Polis', a rice flour crepe. Appetiser and naan are serviced to the table. Service is attentive and professional. Food is refined and delicious that live up to the countless awards and accolades it has earned in the past decade. The next time when you are craving for great Indian cuisine, save your stomach for this unique choice

Friendly, unobtrusive service from Randeep (might have misspelled).Restaurant has a soothing, soft ambience. What we ordered: appetisers: tandoori chicken, black cod tandoori mains: vegetable medley, chicken and fish currydessert: lemon sorbet, mango ice creamnames are all wrong by the way, i can't remember the exact wording for the dishes. I loved the tandoori chicken - just the right amount of char and level of spiciness.my family preferred the black cod tandoori for its softness and succulence. mains: vegetable medley was very, very good. just the right level of creaminess with some spiciness in the background. the fish and chicken curries were alright. I would have preferred something more spicy. To be fair, Randeep did inform us that they were weak to medium levels of spicy. We just assumed that medium spicy in an Indian restaurant would correspond to quite hot for Singaporean tastebuds, but apparently they have already dialled back. We had the curries with garlic/butter/kashimiri naan. Tasty, but a little too crisp for my preference. I like mine soft and chewy
5
Wonderful food Great ambienceMural is Michelin Star and has great culinary skillsLoved the Bhuna Ginger Lam
5
We were in Singapore for a day long stopover and decided it was a must to try a Michelin starred Indian restaurant. They had a buffet for lunch which we opted for. The food was great, especially the butter chicken, okra with lotus root, and the palak with Tofu. A bread basket of assorted Indian breads came with the meal-freshly pulled from tandoor and piping hot. We also had an assorted tandoori kabab platter which was delicious. Would definitely recommend the food and service here
5
It will have to be the best restaurant ambience I've experienced and best food I've eaten outside of India. It's going to be the only Indian restaurant in Singapore that I will visit. WellDone.

I know most of you wont have the patience to read this in full, hence I'll split it into sections.a) The Context:- Occasion: Our wedding Anniversary- # of Pax: 2 adults(wife and me) and 2 parasites, masquerading as our children.(6 and 12 yrs old)- This is supposed to be a Michelin-star rated restuarant, so our expectations were up thereb) The Good:- The wait staff were a delight to deal with. Mandeep especially - she recognized very quickly that my 6 yr old turns the color of a well-done lobster when any hint of heat hits his tongue, so she quietly put a bowl of yogurt on the table for him to stabilize his taste buds. - The cocktails. Missus had an Indian Spice Route and I had the Mauryan Sour. Both were done very well, flavoured delicately and yet managed to ensure the spices were the stars of the drink and not the alochol itself. - The Basil Chicken Kebab from the starters menu. The chicken was just cooked right. It was charred on the edges whilst being tender inside. The Basil marinade was superb - almost could feel like you were in the garden where it was harvested. The accompanying "fruit salsa" was to be the star of the night. Alas, only a small spoonful, over which my daughter and I dueled fiercely. The beauty of this salsa lay in the layers of flavoring that it released... It starts off sweet and citrus-ey, and then unleashes an explosion of heat from the chili as it coats your tongue. The result is a medley of flavors that reminds one of the road-side chaats of Delhi. Brilliantly done!- The Presentation: A big score on this front. Each dish was elegantly presented with dollops of colored mayo. It was a bit disconerting though, the dollops resembled tadpoles... come on folks, just dots yeah? or maybe the time tested brush on the plate?c) The Bad:- We ordered 2 starters (The Lucknawi Gelawat Kebab and the Basil Chicken Kebab). The Gelawat Kebab should be renamed Sukhawat Kebab(Geela means "wet" in Hindi, and Sukha means dry). I've had this kebab at the original god of kebab joints - Lucknow's Tunde. So yes, my baseline is rather high. But then again, Michelin star rated an all that jazz. So yes, the kebab were really bad. Overcooked, dry and overly spiced, It had completely lost nuance. RIP poor Lamb. You gave your life in vain.- Main course was the "Truffle and Mushroom Naan" and the "Garlic Naan". The Truffle Naan was thicker than what you'd expect from a naan, soft and chewy in the middle(read undercooked) and clearly the truffle and the mushroom had a huge fight in the kitchen. Sadly for us, Mushroom killed Truffle and hence there was no Truffle - in real or even oil form, on our plate. It must have been like a Game Of Thrones massacre.. no trace of the Truffle remained. RIP Truffle.- We also ordered "Dal Ma DumPukht Makhni". I should have stayed away just based on usage of grammar in naming this dish. The presentation lacked effort. The chef just poured it into a bowl, twirled some cream on and he must've thought - Viola! I vill imprezz ze patrons! He did not. The unwilling star of the dish was the chilli powder. It felt as much at home as the English Cricket team on their current tour of India. The flavors of butter, the black lentils, the cream were all scorched by the sheer heat of the red chili powder used. RIP Lentils and Tomatoes and Cream. May your family find nirvana in the handi of a better chef.d) The Ugly:- As though 2 parasites, sorry kids, were not enough, a common housefly decided that it would join us and proceeded to give us company throughout the meal. This was probably the only way to have the place be abuzz. I think the fly had better taste, or was a regular here. He/She stayed away from the food. Took in the smells and flew around and then left.Summary: This is a Michelin-star rated restuarant that passes off average Indian fare with fancy names at very high prices. The gap between what could have been, and what is.... is almost as big as the gap between my dream car and what I drive now. RIP $200+. You would have been better served being sacrificed at Little India. Sigh

Awesome food, loved the presentation, very creative. The service staff was very friendly. I would recommend it to everyone
4
Helpful staff, reasonable food prices even ala carte. The ambience is perfect for a romantic dinner.
3
This is not Michelin-starred food there must have been a mistake or we were just on a night where the song was off tune? Some very nice plates and excellent breads but some very poor rogan josh, palek paneer average. Very disappointed overall as expectations were so high, maybe too high. Decor doesn't help although credit to the interior designer who has managed to recreate the ambiance of a shopping mall restaurant in a beautiful black and white...service was good. 270 SGD for 2 people , expensive for what it was
4
My lab mates and boss and I were looking for a buffet that was affordable and within our budget and I chanced upon this indian lunch buffet while searching. As we stepped into the grounds, it felt very serene as the restaurant stood in an old colonial house with a courtyard decorated with plants and some alfresco seating that would be nice for an evening meal. The restaurant had reserved for our group of 10 to be seated in a private dining room, thus providing us with much comfort and privacy as we dined.The range of food is not as vast as an international buffet of course but there was sufficient variety. At our table, they also provided us with two baskets of naan and 2 plates of chicken and vegetarian dish respectively. However, whether the food at the buffet is worth the one-star in the Michelin guide, is something I am doubtful for. I just feel that perhaps the a la carte dishes would be a more accurate display of why the restaurant's awarded one star. I would want to try them one day when I feel like I can afford it one day!Otherwise, my advice to those who go is to not have too much an expectation that you are devouring something out of this world if you are there for the lunch. Just enjoy a delicious indian lunch and leave happy. :
5
Had amazing food in song of india.. its an awesome place to hangout with friends or family or as a couple... the food was super delicious and it was finger licking good.. starters like mushroom cheese, panner tikka was super awesome... not to miss the mango kulfi for the dessert... overall the place has good ambience, environment friendly place and the staff were friendly too.. michelin star you are super awesome as a person and good luck...
4
We were a little hesitant initially as the menu didn't seem to have the well known dishes Indian food has come to be known by. After some assistance from our waiter, he pointed us in the right direction.The tandoori was amazing and our favourite was the tikka. There was plenty of food to the point that we couldn't eat all of it.The setting is an old colonial house so has that real home feel to it. We sat inside as the balcony would have been a bit too warm for the time of year.The service was attentive without being in your face. We really enjoyed the dinner and will be back on our next visit to Singapore
4
The Song of India served us up a decent meal however there were some real stars on the menu compared to some of the options we selected. For starters without doubt the best item was the lamb chops, we also had the samosa and lamb kebab which were nice enough but the lamb chops were divine. The starter portions are also on the generous side so you can certainly share these.For the main dishes the star of the show was the butter chicken. The sauce on this dish was delicious and everyone else on the table was also enjoying this more than the other sauces. We also had a prawn curry and a lamb dish but these were not as good. We also had some of the breads and I can highly recommend the bread with onion, we were also going to opt for a sweeter naan but the waiter recommended against this and he was right as this would not have complimented the dishes.Finally we opted for a couple of desserts, the white chocolate cracked wheat and a creme brulee. The white chocolate dessert was very good and appears to be a signature of the restaurant and is certainly the dessert to go for. The creme brulee was not great and when asked by the waiter how the desserts were I simply said the brulee was not so good compared to the white chocolate dessert. Without any fuss this was taken off the final bill even though we did not ask for this so that is very good service and was much appreciated.As a whole the restauarnt is a nice environment, it was quiet when we went but it was also a Monday night. Our waiter was very attentive and happy to give advice on menu items and all in all we had a very enjoyable evening
4
While location is not convenient (i.e., not in a shopping mall) the building is nice/colonial. Food (North Indian cuisine) is authentic and deserts were really nice. Overall a nice experience..
2
The spread was quite ordinary. Just one paneer/chicken starter, some salads and a small main course selection. Food tasted average and I would rate it below par compared to other Indian restaurants in Singapore, forget comparison with India. No Indian beverages (lassi, aam panna etc) were part of the buffet, and the only saving grace were desserts which tasted fine
4
Located right in Orchard, this classic restaurant is actually quite excluded from the busy district. Love the building and the greenery surrounding it, such a serene place for a great meal. I am not a regular for Indian cuisine and had quite a hard time deciding what to have from the extensive list of dishes from different categories. The staff was super helpful and explained the dishes to us patiently. The meal started off with amuse bouche, sincerely prepared by the Chef. I love how the chicken soup is served with a crispy pastry stick, very delicate. Sarson cod tikka is a must try, flavourful and juicy. Aother dish that I enjoyed the most have to be Palak paneer, very fragrant and the spiciness level is just right.
5
It was good value for our money! Great place to catch up with friends and the service was fantastic
3
I thought some of the dishes we got served were good. And others like an aloo gobi were the potatoes were under-cooked and the cauliflowers were over cooked and overall the dish seemed worse than something I could have made myself, let the meal down. For the price, as well as having a Michelin star - I would have expected a more consistent quality of meal
3
The restaurant is located in a Black-and-White House which makes it very special. However, sitting in the dining makes you feel like on a cruise ship restaurant, I don't know why.The variety of the food is vast and the dishes we had all tasted excellent. Expect the ladies finger dish (Okra), which tasted strange, like burned grass. Service was outstanding. The overall experience was very good, though very, very expensive
4
Prasad made our meal here very delightful ....the lamb shank is great! The milk ice cream is a nice finish to the meal .
4
Food is very good, waiters, especially Prasad, friendly and informative. Enjoyed the dinner very much.
5
It's our family's third time here and we really love the food and ambience here. The quality and service never fails.

My husband and I visited Singapore this month. Near the end of our trip, our friend suggested we meet for lunch at "Song of India" on Scotts Road. We both enjoy Indian food and were excited to try out the restaurant.The décor is quite lovely. The restaurant looks very clean and upscale.We noticed that many people dined in for the lunch buffet, we chose to order from their menu. Our group liked that there were a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options that were suitable for each guest at our table. I personally really enjoyed the vegetarian platter, which showcased a variety of tasty Indian appetizers. The meat eaters at our table really enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala among other dishes. The appetizers, mains and desserts were all very delicious. Additionally, the staff was helpful and friendly
5
I had been to The Song of India , singapore for lunch and had a very good experience. The ambience is simply elegant . It is not too colourful like other Indian restaurants ,but it is royale . The buffet spread was really good , it was not over spicy .The Fish was simply damn tasty and it left a lasting tasting in me. The waiters were couteous and clean.To know that this is run by a Michelin star Indian Chef makes is more proud to be dining there 
5
It amazes me how contrasting restaurant reviews can be. One person can simply love the food and the whole experience while another would describe it as the worst experience ever. Well, if you read The Song of India reviews, it is no different. So who is right and who is wrong? Being a long-time food critic, allow me to share my two cents worth. Having tried their buffet at SGD29.90, this is my take:Food: Without a doubt, they serve really good Indian food. Some dishes like the Goan Fish Curry with Fresh Garlic Naan, you won't be able to match in any other Indian restaurant. The succulently grilled tandoori chicken served as part of the buffet would be a hard act to follow too. Being a Chinese Singaporean, it suited my palate as the spices in the food were not overwhelming but refined. The desserts could be improved though.Ambience: Situated in an old bungalow house, the ambience and comfort aspect was something I think no one has a right to complain about. Parking is free too. It would be difficult to find a better setting than this - very cosy and warm ambience.Service: The service was average but having said that, I do not expect personalised service when I'm having a buffet. After all, a buffet is supposed to be self-service, no? I got whatever I asked for in a reasonable time, so I have no complaints. Things may be different if it were fine dining.Verdict: Don't think Michelin Star, think good Indian cuisine at a great price. I think for SGD29.90, and with that kind of food, ambience and service, it is worth every penny. I think the reason for the contrasting reviews is that people have a pre-conceived idea that since it is a Michelin-Star restaurant, everything has to be PERFECT. But people, it's $29.90, not $299. With Singapore being the most expensive city in the world, you can't go far with $29.90. Eating out is all about getting value for your dollar, I can assure you that you WILL get your money's worth and more. I was told that their à la carte set dinner is about $100, that's pretty reasonable for Michelin Star
3
I personally think this restaurant is overrated and unnecessary way to expensive. The food quality is average and also cost to quantity ratio is terrible. Service is average and I expect the staff to be more polite and humble. I travel a lot and in India even for the best of the 5 stars the rates would not be as high this restaurant. In short I would not recommend this place unless you have lot of money and dont know what to do with it
4
The ambience is good for a relaxed meal. Good vegetarian choices too. The starters are a bit pricey, but good quality. We took the recommendations of the stewards and the meal was great. Desserts were decent.
1
How this restaurant received a Michelin star is beyond me. Service was TERRIBLE. The lady who seated us was rude and looked like she really didn't want to be there. The food was AVERAGE. You order a tasting plate for two and got one piece on a couple of the items. Prawns we're VERY over cooked. Lamb rogan josh was runny and palak paneer was too garlicy. They got our order wrong (very frustrating when the waiter doesn't write anything down and guess what...gets the order wrong!!!)and we received a plain nan instead of a butter nan. When the butter nan was received it was extremely oily and soggy with butter (and was undercooked). Inedible. The little cake for our anniversary was a nice touch on an otherwise average dinner. Also located in a strange area with drunk young Singaporeans below the window we sat near who had music blaring and kept waving and motioning to us. A very disappointing experience. Much better Indian restaurants in Singapore.
2
Lets be clear. This is not a michelin starred restaurant. It fails on almost every level...not least service. On arrival we were left standing in the entrance for some minutes before anyone came to see to us. We requested to sit outside which is a nice little area and preferable to the inside. After taking our seats...we waited a good while for the menus. No drinks were offered. After finally ordering it took around 15minutes for my drink to arrive. I ordered a gin and tonic. Even after the long wait for my drink the gin...ice and can of tonic all arrived seperatly and was awkwardly prepared at the table. The menu is vast and contains a large array of dishes however we wer left to fend for ourselves without any advice or reccomendations from the waitress.I went for the Ginger lamb Bhuna and the lamb was tender and beutifully cooked. The food was tasty enough but nothing special that you cannot get at many decent restaurant s all over Singapore. Also the poppodoms are rolled up and not nice and the dips are from a jar and not a nice jar. Seems this star has enabled them to double the price of the dishes....If you go here expecting a decent overpriced indian you will not be disappointed however it is nothing special unfortunately.
5
We know "many indian restaurants" around the world,this So far THE BEST!Very quiet, very nice building, very friendly and attentive professional people.Right from arriving to leave, comment: perfectThe food just SUPER!You get certainly quality / price WE WILL MAKE SURE : WE RETUR
2
My first time experience was amazing at song of india! Michelin star you are super awesome as a person as well as the food was super delicious.. The chef has some of the finger licking food like mushroom cheese starters, paneer tikka and many more .. super desserts lik mango kulfi and i really fell in love with it.. service was excellent! Over all its a must place for any indian to visit song of india and enjoy delicious food...
5
Had one of the best Indian lunches in Singapore. It has been 12 years in Singapore and has an opportunity to visit Song of India finally! Had been for a Saturday lunch. Amazing ambience, very tasty food. Loved the starter platter especially the mushroom and paneer. Not to miss Alfonzo mango kulfi for dessert! The staff were very friendly. The best part is Chef Mural. Had read about the Michelin Star. After visiting I know why he got one. He Interacts with all guests so nicely asking if the food was ok. He took time to talk and spend time. Overall I just loved it
1
How this place has a Michelin star is beyond me. I would've got better service and food at my local Indian restaurant for $5. To charge $30 for a dish that lacked any real care or consideration is appalling. The decor itself is nice but that's about it. The woman who served us was so ill informed and unprofessional with everything, from when she responded to my question about what a certain dish was "it's very Indian" was the only response I got. When I asked about flavors "Indian sir, taste very Indian" again was the reply.. next after we ordered wine she emptied the bottle, saw that the glass was obviously not filled to where it should be, looked to see if we noticed (we did) and then just shrugged it off and left. Could write so much more about why you shouldn't visit or waste your money, but am about to go get something else to eat, as we left both of our dishes mainly untouched. Such a sad sad experience.
5
Great atmosphere and totally fantastic food! Great service and nice staff. Absolutely worth a visit. We ate from the lunch buffe and that was great, so you do not have to eat the A LaCarte to have a great food experience.
4
Personal visit on my wife birthday. Restaurant is very good, friendly staff, prompt service. They even served b'day cake at no extra cost which made my wife very happy.Food was very good but needs more options for vegetarians in buffet.Overall very happy
4
Food was tasty, service was great. The staff was also quite attentive. It is a quiet place, good for romantic dates. But we ordered quite a bit & could not finish. Maybe just 1 nann instead of 2 will suffice or go with a larger group so that you can try more of their items
3
This is great located and highly rated Indian restaurant so I have been there but I was really not so excited with taste and available options. Also it is really very costly compare to other available options in nearby Orchard road or race course roa
4
The song of India truly deserve a Michelin star. The Chef has some of the amazing food items like the grilled chicken with basil and the blue cheese naan. A good environment but a bit noisy than expected
1
First time after the Michelin Star and the food was good as always.However, 3 things greatly soured my experience.1. There was a big group which was extremely noisy. It made conversation difficult for anyone else and not expected in such a fine dining restaurant. 2. One of the stewardesses (Geetha) was exceptionally rude. I haven't come across such behavior before and she was completely disinterested and not at all concerned about the comfort of the guests. My wife is still angry about her behavior.3. The soap dispenser in the gents was broken and spewing plain water without any soap.Very disappointed with this experience and I hope this does not happen again.
5
Had an amazing experience at Song of India. We wanted to dine in an up-scale restaurant and we made the right choice :)Journey through India set menu is a must try
4
We asked one of the waiter as to why the food tag didn't indicate the equivalent English name of the dish as we didn't know what we were taking, the reply was because it is an Indian restaurant.I rest my case.
4
Third visit to The Song of India and this was shortly after the restaurant won the coveted Michelin star. The Song of India is one of the well-known fine dining restaurants in Singapore and the menu has few atypical dishes like blue cheese naan, mirch ka salan, ulte tawa ka pratha, mushroom and truffle naan. Ordered blue cheese naan, aloo pratha, mirch ka salan, malai kulfi and Masala tea. We were served amuse bouche, compressed papaya with cream cheese before the mains were served. The breads were pretty good. Mirch ka salan, was unique too as the jalapeno peppers were scorched and stuffed with cottage cheese. The gravy was creamy, nutty and subtly spiced. The kulfi was fantastic and bursting with flavors. The presentation was visually appealing with homemade citrus jellies, cashewnut fudge, berries and fruits to offset the sweet taste. Only upon leaving the restaurant, I noticed the commemorative banner kept at the entrance to congratulate the chef for winning the Michelin star. I came to know about their achievement hence, I asked the manager if I could have a word with the chef, which he gladly obliged. Congratulated the chef and appreciated his eye for detail by picking the right choice of fruits to accompany the sweet malai kulfi. Overall, it is one of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore that any foodie will appreciate.
4
My friend reserve a table for dinner. Excellent place to visit. We order one of a set menu. The staff is very courteous,always checking on us.  My special thanks to the restaurant manager Mr. Veer. He noticed my friend feeling cold and offer her a shawl which adds another wow. Good job Mr. Veer.Food was good and overall we had a great time.
3
I guess the Michelin star really hikes your expectations from this place. And when you eat, you are disappointed. The food, if anything, was just average.In fact, we ordered Gajjar ka Halwa for desert and it was quite disappointing. But they are still pricey
3
We enjoyed our dinner here, the best dishes were the lamb cutlets and palak paneer. The venue is lovely though the interior is looking a little tired and the bathroom facilities could do with an upgrade/regular clean. Service was friendly though a little slow and inconsistent.
3
My first time to the restaurant and it was lunch on a Monday after the Deepavali weekend. The buffet selection was limited but sufficient. Food was good. The service was good but sullen. Is it because the servers did not get their day off
3
The food was below average... except for the Papdi chat n desserts... main course n starters were terrible... didn't except that from their buffet.... well I've been there a couple of times... but had either a la carte or set meals.. they r really good n rich...For buffet I wd rate it very poor...Starters were not cooked properly, naan was not good, paneer butter masala was made with tofu, chicken n fish gravies were also not good.
5
The food presented at the Buffet lunch at The Song of India was delicious! There was a wide spread of food and it was all very tasty. The Song of India provides a lovely ambience and this enhances the dining experience. We found the service excellent as the staff were most attentive.
1
My dinner last night at The Song of India was a series of ridiculous, unfortunate events.First, I showed up for my reservation for 1 about 15 minutes early, offering my profuse apologies. The hostess, however, had no record of my booking. Even after I showed her the confirmation email on my phone, she told me, "I'm sorry, sir, we're fully booked." But I have the confirmation email right here! Eventually a manager appeared and escorted me inside.Second, the manager escorts me to a table in the middle of the dining room. I was alone and preferred to sit on the sides - less conspicuous that way. I asked to be moved to a different table, but again I was told, "I'm sorry, sir, we're fully booked." At that point, I was the only person in the restaurant. I said, "But no one is here." They said, "I'm sorry." I said, "But I don't want to sit here." They said, "We're fully booked." I said, "I'm more than happy to leave and never come back if it's that hard for you to change my seat." They showed me to a new table.Third, as anyone can see from their website, they have several different set menus available, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. I had already made up my mind to select the Jugal Bandi menu (a non-veg pairing of inventive food and wine) before I arrived. But I was only given an ala carte menu. I asked my server for the set menus, and he said there were none. I told him there were several on the website? Eventually the same manager as before brought me the set menus. But when he saw me turn to the last page with the Jugal Bandi menu, he told me that one was not available. "All sold out." (Remember, at this point, I am the only one in the restaurant.) In fact, he said that on Friday nights, actually only ONE set menu is available - the "Journey through India" vegetarian option. I said, "Excuse me? Where on your website does it say that only ONE set menu - a vegetarian one at that - is available on Friday nights? If I had known that, I would not have come all the way here." He says, "I'm sorry, sir, what can I get you?" I say, "I'm not sure I even want to stay at this point. Please leave me alone for a moment and let me enjoy my drink."Fourth, he comes back 15 minutes later and asks me, "Have you made up your mind, sir?" I say, "You're telling me I have no choice, that one menu is available, so what exactly are you expecting me to decide?" He says, "Yes, sir." I say, "Please just bring me whatever you're allowing me to eat this evening so that I can leave as soon as possible. Thank you."By that point, my mood and my appetite were completely ruined. The food that eventually came out was OK, I guess, but honestly, I prefer my local place (Chutney Mary) out in Katong/Siglap area. And my bill at the end of the night for that vegetarian set menu and 2 drinks was over $150 - a bit ridiculous for all the drama I had to endure. This is certainly not what I expect from a restaurant that has earned a Michelin star, and I am more than willing to bet they will not retain it next year.Avoid

Ordered in the works from the starters to several mains, including naan. Portion are significantly larger compared to other Indian fine dining, so don't over order. The Dum biryani was tasteless, while the others remain flavorful BUT not worthy of Michelin, or rather the Michelin rating is just fast becoming another media publicity stunt. Service was good, but wont return or recommend to my associates, I can seriously get better food elsewhere at Muthu Curry or Samy Curry

Song of India had earlier this year been bestowed with a Michelin star, but its a decision that flummoxed Indian food lovers in Singapore. While the ambience here is amongst the best for Indian restaurants in town, the food doesn't stand out per se. While the general standard is 3.5-4/5, it would be the same as with half a dozen of its peers. Nonetheless, if you're going to the Song of India, you're going there for the ambience (its in a lovely colonial bungalow) and for the feel of the place
5
One of the best Indian food I've had!!! The service and place were excellent too! Couldn't ask for more
5
Booked this restaurant for the Buffet Lunch promo at 30$++ hoping to have some good authentic Indian food from a Michelin star chef... and it didnt disappoint. Food was great, spread was very limited but alright, decor and location of place was good. Service staff were helpful. Only suggestion would be to have less restaurant staff walking around or standing around and staring while guests are eating as it makes some people very uncomfortable and spoils the privacy of a nice quiet meal.
1
Terrible and disappointing!!! Food - a highly generous average rating! Service - BAD!Ambience - averageI've never been sooo disappointed with any restaurant in Singapore. Being a Michelin Star Indian resto, I went there with really high expectation and eagerness. Made the appointment in advance but they couldn't 'locate' the same on their diary. Resto was hardly occupied so got a table anyway. 3 of us opted for the set menu and chose different options. Stale food, burnt dal (lentil curry), undercooked lamb are a few disappointments to highlight. There was pepper ice cream on the menu which turned out just vanilla ice cream with some pepper sprinkled on it! The waiters were not professional at all. 1 of them took away my mom's plate while she was still not done. Overall, a very bad experience. Will discourage anyone who wants authentic indian food and at least decent service. Far better Indian restos are there in Singapore
5
Awesome food. Excellent service. Nice ambience. Should be on the list of Indian restaurants to visit when in Singapore.
2
I went with my friends just to try out the place. Compared to other Indian restaurants in Singapore, this one is really average in terms of food. The owner probably reduced the amount of spices in each dish to accommodate people who prefer lighter tastes, however, it was done in a simple way that only the taste of the spices were less but no additional flavours added. With that said, the dishes should be more accurately described as Indian inspired dishes but not authentic Indian food. I personally prefer more authentic Indian food, so I cannot give the restaurant more then two stars.....
4
Fantastic decor. If you were Samson you could bring the house down by pushing apart the Greek Pillars. The food is very good. More unusual meat dishes, very subtlely spiced dishes, vegetarian choices were excellent. Nan bread very light with saffron flavouring really good. Food and drinks expensive : pay for surroundings and lovely house. Staff OK but no special effort
3
Nothing special but a good Indian food restaurant. Very nice decor and service. Traditional Indian Cuisine served with a slight Singaporean twist. Will go back again
4
I recently had the 'journey of India' set menu at this restaurant and was very impressed!There's a sense of fine dining at the Song of India but without being too stuffy. The food is probably one of the best Indian I've had in Singapore; very delicious!The only drawback was that sometimes the service was 'too' efficient. As soon as a dish was finished, it was whisked away and the next course was served immediately. Maybe there could be a little 'pause' between courses.Besides this, I would fully recommend this restuarant
5
Waiters are very gentle and always charming. Well behaved. Always stand by. I would recommend this restaurant to all my friends and colleagues anytime.
4
The saturday buffet lunch is value for money compare to their ala carte menu. I like their tandoor chicken and dum chicken briyani. But the buffet menu have limited choices so may wish to pay extra to order other ala carte dishes from their men
5
wonderful food and service. especially for blue chesse nann...... goan fish curry and lamb and remember using AMEX..
3
Food options were limited, could have been more, all curries were too watery, expected better quality food for money paid. I may not visit again.
3
Staff were friendly, food was decent. Portion was decent. A little bit on the expensive end for the quality
4
I've been to a few Michelin star restaurants before, but this was the first Indian Cuisine one. Overall, the experience was nice overall. Yes, some people, when they start comparing this to a small Indian restaurant in India, they would feel that this is pricey.. but hey, that's the case with every Michelin star restaurant. Overall, my review:Pros:1. Good location.2. Good atmosphere. It's built in a small house like building, unlike many other restaurants in Singapore, which are either in a mall or in a dinig place (Clarke Quay etc).3. Food was good. It wasn't the best I have ever eaten, but yes it was good.4. Service was very good. The staff was very helpful.Cons:1. It was very cold. :( By 8 month baby just couldn't sleep or stay inside the restaurant. So, this spoiled the mood a bit.2. The food portion, especially the platter and starters, need to be a bit bigger. For the price, it was not enough.Overall, decent place to visit. It will be on the expensive side (Because of the Michelin Star), so beware
2
Not sure why we ended up at this place. To some extent, it was accidental rather than intentional, and it was a very disappointing experience. Save your money and go elsewhere to Shahi Maharani or Rang Mahal or Ras (Clarke Quay).The Good:1. Good presentation of food. 2. Friendly, attentive staff.3. Cozy, exotic ambiance with beautiful decorative plates.The Not-Good:1. Terribly small portion size. Even in the starters platter, they don't even serve one tiny piece of each item to go round all the persons in your family, which was 4 in our case. We had to slice each tiny item into a smaller piece so that each of us could taste it, and effectively we couldn't taste anything as the piece was smaller than a bite-sized!2. Priced exorbitantly compared to many other Indian restaurants that serve excellent food.3. Food taste is rather average, especially for the price you pay and the portion size.4. As if the food is not average to bad enough, it was pathetic to see that the plates in front of us were totally dusty and unclean. I wiped off a whole finger of black dust from the plate and showed it to the staff who apologized and changed them for us while explaining that those are not plates to be eaten from and hence they were not clean! Nice joke ...5. You'd expect the restroom of such a swanky place to be clean and well-maintained but NO, the bolt wasn't working properly, there were no hooks to hang one's purse on, and there was some leakage -- all this in a very dark and gloomy area ! Ridiculous oversight, I should say
1
I called to make reservation and asked if my Amex card is entitled for the 50% chope promo, the staff said yes as long as my Amex card starts with 3762 which meant it's the platinum series. But when I had dinner there last Friday and the bill came, the staff charged me the full amount and when I asked why, they said its because my card is a krisflyer card. Then why didn't they tell me that on the phone
1
This was truly a memorable evening for all the wrong reasons. Service, value for money and the quality of food were all terrible. We are avid fans of good indian food and this restaurant was on our bucket for a special occasion, this was a total miss for us on every level. Not sure if they just had an "off" night but they'll get no recommendations from us or a return visit, a great shame. Bo

My friend and I had the Sunday brunch buffet, and enjoyed our meal thoroughly. The spread of food was not very wide, but the quality of the food was superb! Serving the appetizers and food from the live station to our table was a thoughtful gesture, but otherwise the wait staff could have been a little more attentive. The masala tea (not included in the buffet, unfortunately) was pleasant, but could do with more spices. Overall, I must say this place truly deserves its Michelin star
5
Congratulations to Veer and the team at Song of India for their Michelin Star! Just enjoyed another fantastic meal. Service and food are the best! Mandeep was great and remembered my preferences from last time I enjoyed! This is the best in Singapore. No best in SEA
4
The food was well prepared but the set menu lacked sufficient variety in flavors and textures, and the wines provided in the pairings were mediocre. The waitstaff was cordial but the kitchen failed to time the service properly
4
We had the set dinner on a Sunday night. The restaurant is cosy, within a charming colonial house. We chose the non-vegetarian set - which is mainly modern Indian, with starters, soup, mains and dessert. The food is well presented and the waiter explains what each dish is. The price is reasonable, given this is a one Michelin star restaurant and is fine dining. Will consider coming back again
5
Having lunch Buffett , all the food are excellent , staff friendly n price is value for money . Even just won Michelin one star but still worth to dine here . Will come back again
1
Horrible! I wish I could rate this in negative. Absolutely terrible place with stuck up people! I suffered from food poisoning after visiting this place. This is the first time in our life my family and I have ever wasted food in a restaurant. We always order enough to finish or take away as we completely against wastage of food. When the food arrived it was so terrible we had to waste it all. We decided to speak to a few people there and they were so full of themselves that all they said was oh please come back again and we will make sure you have a good experience. No apologies and nothing! But I would never go back
5
very good surprise! We have been there before the restaurant got its Michelin first star, and we went after (last week). Quality of the food and service still excellent, and price remain unchanged! very good. bravo the Chef!!
4
Good ambience..the charm of the old colonial style bungalow is really cool. Food wise we being pure veg the choices were limited but whatever was there was very good. The paneer (cottage cheese) dishes were superb...service could improve a bit..
5
Brought my family there for lunch on Sunday. Located in a charming colonial style bungalow off Scotts Road which is a unique and refreshing change. Food was delicious, with a wide variety of dishes. Curries were rich, flavorful and very delicious! And the staff was amazingly attentive and responsive to our needs throughout. Highly recommended if you are looking for top notch Indian food in an upscale but still family friendly setting
5
I went for a dinner with my wife and friends on 9th August 2016 at Songs of India and it was a wonderful experience. Right from welcome at reception table decorum ,presentation of food, quality and taste with full comfort and light music added to our experience..They made our evening pleasant and we enjoyed it.Long live Sons of India!!!
5
The ambience of the place is perfect for a cozy dinner for two. The layout is ideal and spacious. The service of the staff is one of the best - very attentive and approachable. Even the Chef himself came out and checked with us if everything was ok. The food - basically premium quality. Overall, an awesome experience and definitely be back for the excellent food and quality service
5
Rich and tantalizing flavors. Melt in the mouth meats and gourmet veggies. On our 6 day trip we ended up going there every day either for lunch or dinner.
5
My friends n I enjoyed our lunch at Song Of India very much. The waiters were constantly keeping watch to our needs and atarters were serve without us asking. What made it even more pleasing was when the chef came out table to table asking us how we found the food and if there was any nees for improvement. It was sure an extra gesture by the chef to make us have a pleasant dinning experience.
5
We were a family of 10 celebrating a wedding anniversary and we were very pleasantly surprised to be given a private dining room with a dedicated staff to attend to us. She was very knowledgeable on the dishes and helpful in recommending what to order. We had several starters and main courses to share and everything was good, except for one of the eggplant dishes! The chicken soup especially is a must try! And the dum briyanis as well. The chef kindly gave us complimentary dessert for the anniversary couple to top off the wonderful evening! It wasn't our first visit and it won't be the last! One piece of advice: if you can't get a parking lot there, park at Sheraton Hotel just down the road
3
This restaurant obviously met certain standards to be awarded the 1 Michelin Star so I shall not tell you what is good about the restaurant, instead I will be providing my feedback to the restaurant so that they can get 2 stars.1)Though no fault of the restaurant - there was an irritating mosquito at my table 2) When my food came out of the kitchen, it was left at the corner for quite long, I had to gesture to a waitress to serve it to me before it got cold.3) I had to ask for water refill, it wasn't given to me automatically4) Do not order the fried okra, it was just shredded deep fried okra, not worth the pric
5
This has to be one of my favorite Indian restaurants ever! We lived in Singapore back in 2011 and use to visit it often, and ever since we moved out, I have been waiting for a chance to return , a trip I finally made last month! Let me start by saying that the Chef and his staff is extremely professional, polite and thorough. They are extremely kind towards families with kids and do cater willingly to any special request... All with a smile. Excellent and attentive service!The chef's tasting menu was amazing! I had the kebabs and main course of lamb-- that was cooked in lakhnavi style and to perfection. Meat was melt in mouth perfect with amazing blend of spices... And yet in the bone- perfect! The shorba (soup) was beautifully balanced with a stick of khari as soup stick.. I love and appreciate such traditional elements incorporated into dishes... Some things that add an X factor and we don't get anywhere else, and yet... It completes the dish in a unique lovely way! Plates were decorated with "rangoli" of chutnies (sauces) ... All this makes the heart go wow! Dessert platter was amazing.. Traditional and modern twisted into one plate and each bite a delight!... Really can't wait to return to the restaurant..All the best to Chef Mural and his team at The Song of India, and a special thank you for the experience.

The food was good but the main thing that would bring me back to the restaurant is the friendliness of the staff. Very attentive and detailed to attention. Overall a wonderful dinner treat
3
Has limited quantity of food but varies through different styles of Indian cooking. The ambience is very Indian, decorative and grand so it's suitable for special occasions. The place is very cold so don't forget a scarf while the location is moderate. Its very expensive especially ala carte menu.
2
Michelin star?? Really? We went with high expectations but you can honestly get better food in an Indian takeaway from Bob The Builder in Southall. Where do I start? Too much tandoori paste in the lamb kebab made it look radioactive, the chicken quality for the the laziz karahi was E grade at best, and the hyderbadi salan tasted like it was flown in from there last week. The best thing was the roomali roti which alas my 6 year could make with a stool and a rolling pin, and the tarka daal which arrived 10 minutes later than the other main courses. Overall thoroughly underwhelming and I suggest they stick the star in the tandoor.
3
Food is the usual North Indian style. But the paneer was tough and the pulao had no fragrance. Cod Tikka and sag paneer were good but the dal and chicken not even average. Expensive but I guess u pay for the location.
4
This is almost authentic Indian restaurant in Singapore.The tastes is great, the service somehow is average and menu choice is not very wide.But overall a good choice
4
Went there for weekday lunch. They had buffet promotion for 29.90++ (SGD 35) which was ok. Service could be better as waiter assigned did not bother to explain anything about buffet. He didnt tell that starters would be served at table and rest from buffet. Neverteless, he was polite. Also, after the meal, we were asked now you want Tea or Coffee giving impression that it was part of buffet (which was not), little bit honesty is desired at such high end restaurant.Coming to Ambience it was good, in an old colonial bunglow at Scotts road.Food was ok. Non-veg starter grilled chicken was below average, veg option paneer tikka was much better. They have decent variety, 2 salads and samosa alog with Soup for appetizer, 1 chicken and 1 fish curry, 2 veggie dish and Dal.There were 2 options for rice, Chicken biryani which was excellent and Jeera rice. Bread was made to order. The waiter did not ask us, we have to tell chef directly while taking our food from buffet.Dessert was decent with carrot cake, Strawberry Mousse, a fruit and Kheer.Overall a very good value deal in decent setup
3
We reserved a table to have lunch with old buddies. Good location & ambience. Food is average only. Not much choice but taste is good. The dessert is deliciously. Service could be improved. Overall good experienc
5
We had diner one night, although it was costly it was well worth it. the flavors were fantastic and the staff were fantasti
4
 Pleasant dinner with kind initiative from the staff for our wedding birthday. The overall was very goo
4
Nice ambience n fantabulos food. Service was good n i would love to go again. If you are looking for nice place with good foods than songs of india would be the one
3
My Indian friends going way back told me that the authenticity of Indian cuisine can be best judged by the chef's preparation of the deceptively simple dish: dhal. And that was what I based the evaluation of my experience at Song of India on. The verdict? It's pretty average, I've had better but there were worse dhal experiences too. The malabar fish curry was not too bad as was the chicken pulao. The naan was a little varied, going from burnt to a tad oily. Still the gulab was decent and helped round off the meal
5
Repeat visit to try out different dish. Service was great, manager (?) came to ask how we liked our food. No dirty looks as would other high end resto when my little toddler made loud noise and wandered ard
5
I have to say the one restaurant that I wanted to return to on my second trip to Singapore was The Song of India. The food is excellent. It did not disappoint on my second visit. My coworker and I ordered one starter and split one vegetarian and one lamb dish. The one thing to watch out for is they don't ask you the level of spice that you want. I love spicy and it was very reasonable for me. My coworker thought the cauliflower dish was to spicy. I loved it. Definitely worth a visit especially if you are on an expense account.
3
Food was good ..First time experienced a lunch buffet without tomato sauce n ice cream ... N number of dishes were very less for the money they charge ...
3
Liked the food and the ambience. Overall a nice evening. Given the quantity of their food, it is a bit expensive though. Deserts especially the kulfi was not up to the markIts a nice colonial house close to Orchard. Worth a visit at least once.Avoid the deserts
5
This is really it. I have been visiting Song of India for 20 years and honestly it is my favorite Indian restaurant worldwide. The location is great in a really neat old sing mansion. Food is exceptional and staff are the best. I travel the world and I make sure that when I am due in Singapore that I book my table here for Saturday evening. Staff and management are the best!
5
A fine dining experience of the mighty Indian cuisine that we experienced through a 5 course set menu called Journey through India. For 'not a soup lover' the chicken muligtwany soup and befitting starters were a palette teaser. A well spiced prawn chettinad curry, Chicken handi, Tandoori salmon served with warm house breads, were all perfectly made to the 'T'. Fulfilling main course, sorbet as a palette cleanser and my favourite desserts Malai kulfi and Gulab jamuns. Fabulous food and a fantabulous set of staff including the Chef. Chef Mural, ensures the guests are comfortable and is very keen to receive feedback. A humble Michelin star chef who along with his team whips up great food. We have been here few times already and will definitely go back again
5
We visited this place with friends from Newcastle UK and they absolutely loved the food and the restaurant it's ambience and the service. We went there for dinner and tried the chefs tasting menu veg and non veg and my husband had the journey of India - non veg set menu . Each course / dish was perfection . Absolutely delicious . We totally enjoyed the experience and so did our friends from the UK . A must visit for the best Indian food in Singapore 
1
I've been to Song of India a couple of times. And each time I leave promising myself never again. A couple of months later I get dragged there by some friend who's read or heard that it's run by some Michelin star Chef. The food is average at best. The buffet costs $45. What you get is basic Little India fare that shouldn't cost more than $5. Today we sampled chicken biriyani, naan, dal, and baingan bharta. All very average. The dessert was gajar halwa which was like orange play doh. The hole in the wall places in Little India do better.
4
We went to this restaurant on Sunday evening.. Very good ambience and location.. We ordered family set dinner for a family of 3 and a toddler..good thing there was a separate kids menu in this meal.. It was a 4course meal..Food arrived in small portions and tasted good.. All of us enjoyed dining here.. Will definitely recommend.. Price is on a higher side.. Almost $60-70 per person.. Starter took a lot of time to arrive.. 
5
Me and my family visited song of india in April. Food was good and I liked the ambience also. My kids also felt comfortable at this place. The food was really good and we felt as if we are eating home cooked delicacies. The air conditioner was making the place very cold. The staff was very thoughtful and they offered me to wear a pure wool shawl for some time. It was a sweet gesture. It was my birthday next day so my husband asked for a small cake which they bought with bful decoration and a candle. Overall it was an unforgettable experience. We were happy that we found this authentic restaurant on foreign land. Can't wait to revisit

Very spicy food, though I am used to spicy food. Waiters were just about ok, not the service we expect for such expensive place

I have been to song of India few years back, when Michelin star chef hosted a lunch as a part of world gourmet summit. Decided to pay a visit as it has been sometime. We went for a late lunch on a weekday and they were serving both buffet food and a la carte for lunch. As we were pretty hungry, we decided to go for buffet.The buffet spread include soups, crackers, a salad bar, a chaat dish, four vegetarian dishes, three non-vegetarian dishes, a vegetarian pulao and a briyani. The dessert spread had fruits and three desserts. On that particular day they served summer, lotus root crisps and paneer chaat for starters. They also served two plates of grilled baby potatoes and hariyali chicken, piping hot from the tandoori oven. Once we were done with the starters, the waitress came over to take orders for naan promptly and served it shortly. All the dishes were tasty; the blueberry panna cotta was unique and refreshing.Overall, the service was excellent, food was good and definitely value for money.
5
Outstanding food, great service and warm ambience. Would recommend their fine desserts and starters.
5
The service was good. The ambient was nice. The waiters were friendly and knowledge with the food and the surrounding. Worth the money spent

Having lived in Singapore for a few months now, and with my family and good friend over, my wife and I decided to treat everyone to a great meal. From what I had read about this restaurant, I expected just that. To be fair, what I had was not unpleasant and the restaurant itself was clean and wholesome, but for S$100 + per head it was hugely disappointing. The service was amateurish at best. To clear plates and deliver dessert menus whilst one of my party was still eating his main course is inexcusable. By the time we departed I could fully appreciate why the place was half empty on a Saturday night. The following evening my son and I ate at Lau Pa Sat hawker centre where we had a far tastier meal, admittedly in some what less salubrious surrounding but quite clean, for S$8 each. Song of India is simply not worth the money in mu humble opinion, in fact I cannot remember any restaurant in recent memory where I have felt more disappointed when being present with the bill, not since our visit to Embers in Yosemite and even that redeemed itself by being so terrible it was almost funny.
4
Very nice location in the Colonial Area of Scotts Road. Beautifully located in a very nice building. Had a very nice dining experiencing with good food being served. Its truly fine dining therefore amount of food limited. Service was very good, bill was like the food, spicy
3
very nice environment for a small group meet up and chill buffet. not crowded at all which was nice! small buffet spread but tastes were great - loved the butter chicken and curry veg! rice was good too. the fish seemed a little of the cheap quality side but not terrible. service was on and off - they were great in making sure once one serving of naan was getting cold to top up a fresh basket!! loved that. but slow otherwise (they seemed busy doing other things?)interesting kebab chicken with a very delicious salsa!!salad section also not bad with decent beetroot and chickpea/bean salad dishes.desserts that day were strawberry mousse and some wheat cup (tasted almost like a sweet rice muesli??) and a sweet warm carrot dessert - interesting but very sweet!if the spread had included mutton would have given a 4.5 rating!
4
The restaurant is in a stand alone house on Scotts Road. It's convenient to the Sheraton which is next door and a five minute walk. I went as an alternative to dining in the hotel. The reception is friendly and the dining room spacious. Choices are classic. Service was a little slow but the food excellent
4
The food here is really nice but pricey!! 4 of us paid â‚¬370 !!!I did have to ask for our drinks a couple of times. But the food was really nice tasting and it was a nice and clean establishment. A lady called Geetha was particulary great with our 4 year old, and that always makes a difference
4
Went to Songs of India to celebrate the anniversary of my first cousin. We started of with the Veg Platter, Dal, Vegetables and Naan's. The ambience is really nice....the dessert are to die for. Don't mind going to this place just for desserts!The quality of food is distinct though the place is expensive in comparison to other Indian eaterie
1
If I wanted to be surrounded by flies at dinner, I'd eat at my local hawker centre. I certainly wouldn't expect to pay $$$$ for the "privilege". The decor and the building are absolutely gorgeous, although there are steps everywhere, making this beautiful restored black-and-white very inaccessible for people with disabilities.The staff were professional but incredibly glum. Not a smile among the three people we interacted with. I thought they knew what they were doing for a "fine dining" establishment, but NO! The place was mostly empty but a family with a small noisy child arrived and were placed in the table immediately next to us. That was extremely rude and annoying, and set the scene for most of our meal.Really good, extensive wine list. Well done to the sommelier!Salmon kebab (i.e. tikka) was wonderful. Beautifully presented with amazing flavours and three different condiments and sauces. Excellent dish, highly recommended. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from here.Lamb shank was chewy and did not fall off the bone. Worse, it was served almost cold... just luke warm. How hard is it to ensure the food is hot when delivered to the table? The gravy was very dull, no curry or even Indian spicy flavour to it, just pan drippings, flour and cream. Not great, and way overpriced.Dessert of "chilli" ice cream was nice, but there was no chilli in sight. Don't be fooled! It was a couple of scoops of nice vanilla ice cream with some (old, not fresh) black pepper sprinkled on top. It was served with some beautiful pieces of fresh fruit and delicious Indian sweets. Not bad but not chilli.Summary: don't bother. The food at many places along Race Course Road is much better and you get avoid the price tag
4
I was staying at the Sheraton down the road and felt like stepping out for dinner, but didn't want to go too far. I had seen this place a few times in passing during my last visit to SG, so though I'd try it out. It's pretty nice inside, but they try too hard to be fancy fine dining. The food is incredible...but at an unfortunately high price. I ordered palak paneer, garlic naan and butter chicken, with a bill of $95. They gave me a small portion of rice complimentary after I asked if rice came with my chicken, so that was pretty great. But $95 for 2 dishes, no starter and no drinks is too much for a place like this.Again the food was fantastic and service was really great but the price is extreme in my opinion.
4
Wanna burn your tongue with the spices from india??? then this is the right place to satisfy your tummy. Expensive but a very good place to taste Indian food
3
I heard that it was a good place to go for authentic Indian food but was most disappointed. The food came cold. It was very pricy too
5
This was first time back to Singapore since retirement and wanted special dinner with my friends there. The Song of India did not disappoint. The house was wonderful...full of history...the decoration was tasteful....the service was superior. One of our party was himself Indian so he did most of the talking to our waitress. It was an interesting dialog that continued more less throughout the meal where they would talk about each course and how it should be done....especially, how spicy it should be. What amazed me was that most waitresses would be put off by such interaction....in this case it seemed natural and pleasant.The food was excellent....each dish was well done and seasoned perfectly for non Indian tastebuds. Also the mango lassies and Marcela tea were great.The place was a bit pricey, but I thought it was worth us.One thing that did help was that one of our group is a resident of Singapore, but grew up in Mumbai. He's taken me and other friends to Indian restaurants in many cities. I must confess that Indian menus are completely cryptic to me, but my friend always orders for us.....he tells me "Don't worry....I know what you people will like".....and he's always right
5
Good foodWorth going and eat so better once u r here in Singapore Nice ambiance vegii food and butter chicken is good  
5
Had a great experience; staff was very helpful and the pre-fixe allowed you to sample dishes you would not usually try. I would recommend this for a special romantic evening

We love eating Indian food and were looking for a more up-scale experience.When entering the restaurant, you're definitely not disappointed: this is a very nice dÃ©cor for an Indian restaurant. Set in a beautiful black and white house in a fantastic location on Scotts Road, just off Orchard Road.The place feels like a fine dining experience with nice ambiance and plenty of staff to serve you.Unfortunately, the food is pretty average and well over-priced. Looking at the menu, the dishes sound mouth-watering and there's a lot of variety but once it appears on the table, you may be at just any average Indian restaurant. The lamb korma and chicken masala were swimming in a thick sauce and there was absolutely no effort in terms of food presentation. The tasting platters were quite ok but we suspect the prawns gave 2 of us got severe stomach ache the next day. The food didn't look very fresh overall which was quite surprising given it was the evening before Diwali. We also ordered cocktails to start with (The Song of India's Spice Route) and that was probably the most disappointing cocktail I have ever been served. Looked more like a glass of tea filled with ice cubes and it didn't taste nice at all. It's also not cheap and given the location/ambiance that's acceptable. However the quality of the food needs to be up to standard as well. By the way, charging $11 / $23 for a (small) portion of plain white/ saffron rice is a bit exaggerated.Wine list was ok and what you'd expect at a fine Indian restaurant.Service was ok, no comments

Great food and a great atmosphere. Service was excellent as well. Good selection of wines. Loved the place!

So we heard alot of good abt The Song of India and decided on booking a Deepavali lunch there.Nice colonial exterior, looks very cosy but the service just didnt match up. Having made a reso 2 weeks prior, my mom was informed on the Sun bef we went that they didnt have her reso. When we arrived, the party before us got a very good welcome and when it came to us, the lady was just frowning asking if we have made a reso (despite us saying we did) and when she finally found it without any welcome or anything, simple brought us to the table, sat us down and walked off.Staff can be a little more attentive to refills of water and naan bread; which happened to only our table. The food was ok, the Chicken Dum Briyani was flavourful, that was the best. I love a good gulab jamun but found theirs too soft.One thing this irked me was that we had a toddler with us and she was overly excited and screaming. While I find it is within my limit to shush my child, I do not expect the service staff there to shush my child. They should not allow kids or any loud banter in the resto given how anal they are. There are other Indian restos around the island which are more welcoming to families and serves fantastic food that is accompanied with great service

There's a line in "Ebony and Ivory' that says there's good and bad in everything, and my Sunday lunch visit to Song of India was a liitle like that.The building itself is very eclectic, colonial-feel, but comfortable. I found the staff attentive, though did chuckle to myself when the gent on the front desk asked if I had a reservation (I was the first customer in the place and only two or three couples came in after me during my lunch - I think they had room ...).I liked the idea with the lunch buffet, which was most was self-served as hot dishes - excellent mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices - with other items brought to your table as extras. The extras were naan bread (very good), the small dish with a fried potato fritter covered with chana masala (yum), and a plate with mixed grilled items.The mattar keema from the buffet was excellent (underrated dish if you ask me) and the biriyani rice was tasty and moist. However, the let down for me was the mixed grill dish. There were some fish tikka, grilled vegetables, a sheekh kebab that I was advised was spicy and a milky colored chicken tikka. The fish tikka was flavorful, but cool temperature wise, The chicken tikkas were colder and the sheekh type kebab was ultra dry and dusty. A great idea, but the execution was off - perhaps they had been made too early but the innovation of the mixed platter was lost in the loss of temperature. They may have all been terrific when they were fresh off the grill, but it must have been earlier in the day. Overall, ambience and service was fine, bill a little high for what was on offer, and just not quite on song ......

Not sure what has happened to this restaurant. It has its good and bad days . inconsistent and very expensive place not worth quarter of the price
4
Indian food can be easily found in Singapore especially in Little India but the taste offered by The Song of India is far better.
5
Had an amazing dining experience at Song of India. The ambience is very warm and has a colonial feel to it. The food was very good, very authentic. Had a good family dinner!Chef Mural is very hospitable and makes an effort to interact and speak to guests. It was a pleasure meeting him after so many years!I look forward to visiting the restaurant again
3
Decent Indian food, served in civilized portions in its own style (a customised, glass thali!).The server didn't know to serve ladies first, nor managed to serve the guests first (seemed intent on serving the host team first inspire of repeated requests by them).No smile or grace in service and I'll trained
5
We went to this hotel for dinner last week and it is really nice.A fine dining experience of some lovely Indian food awaits visitors although the prices also reflect that.Recommended
5
My experience was excellent . Great place with decoratively placing of tasty food .kumsutradrink was really mind blowing .the food comes in great style .ambeince was excellent . Best place to make your memorable day more memorable

Set in a quaint old house near Newton Circus, this Indian restaurant serves standard indian fare, at a premium. Food is above average, but then, so is price. Service is average for the price paid. Parking is on the grounds (so it's free), but don't drive your Rolls, it's a tight fit!An interesting option for a date, perhaps
3
The food was really good. But the service was somewhat weird. When our company of nine persons turned up, the waitress seemed to wonder what we were doing there, so many, without reservation. After getting a nice table in a separate room, she continued to act strangely, leaning over us when serving randomly from left or right, no presentation of food. When asking if we wanted another beer and we said yes, she grabbed our half full glasses but then we protested and emptied our glasses in a hurry. As someone else paid the bill I don't know about the value for money. The evening was anyway amusing as it felt like an Indian version of Fawlty Towers, but with nice food
3
Ambience was too. Ordered for Shirley temple Mocktail, and i was simply served Sprite with Dasani Permanent sugar. Average experience. They need some good investment on Staff for being trained for efficient servings. Overall - Average experienc
4
This restaurant was close to our hotel so we walked there our last night in Singapore. The decor is rather fancy, and the prices are quite high, but the food was excellent. There were plenty of vegetarian options, and everything we had was delicious. Would recommend this restaurant for a romantic evening, or especially if you have a business expense account
3
Came here for the AMEX Palate deal. Ordered the palak paneer, the kebab set, the Goan fish curry and naan. The palak paneer was the best item out of the whole meal, which was surprising. The fish curry and the kebabs weren't very flavourful. It's a nice looking place, part of the cluster of old colonial houses, but no reason to go back. Very average
4
The restaurant is in one of the redesigned bungalows on scotts road, so the setting is extremely cozy.. The food is very good with lots of variations from the usual indian menus seen elsewhere..The desserts are nice too especially the gajar halwa
3
Nice place for dinner and good quality Indian food. It was quite quiet the night we visited and the bill was more eye watering than the curries. Maybe a special occasion place but be prepared to bring your own atmosphere...
4
Food was good. Ambience was nice. Service could be better. One of the lady staff did appear a bit rude. 
3
Pretty average. Service was good, ambience was pleasant. Starters were the best part of dinner. Very good chicken tikka and cod starter. Main course disappointed - not as rich in flavour as I would have expected. Nonetheless - an enjoyable experience overall
3
Went there as a family (4 adults and 1 kid) for the buffet lunch on 24-June.Location: 8/10- Very posh location; this is a landed bungalow converted into a restaurant on Scotts Road.Ambience: 7/10- nice serene surroundings, not noisy. Dimly lit interiors give a pleasant feel.Service: 6/10- honestly to us the staff looked a bit 'lost' and could be more responsive.Food: 5/10- that's what we went there for! A few details:A) Little variety: 2 chicken starters and 1 veg starter: all looked and tasted the same.B) Main course: Goan fish curry, chicken tikka masala (too oily and spices not balanced well), corn with vegetables (decent), daal tadka (decent), paneer (so-so), assortment of Indian breads (good).C) Desserts: moong daal halwa (too sweet), Strawberry and Pistachio mousse (strawberry was the saving grace), wheat kheer (average). Overall: lacked variety and imagination.Cost: S$ 29.90++ or 35 all in per person. Didn't charge us for the kid.All in all- may try if you have run out of Indian restaurant options in SG. Otherwise- a bit disappointing.Disclaimer: Have not tried their a-la-carte menu, so this review should be seen in the context of a buffet lunch only

I went to this restaurant for a group dinner. We were a large group, and predominantly vegetarian. The food we ordered was really good. The naans and the rotis were fresh, and the side dishes (curries) were yummy. I felt the gravy they used in the side dishes was of a slightly different taste from the usual fare you get in Singapore, which was refreshing. The portions were a bit small, though. The starters we ordered were great too! Special mention for the great service. They patiently waited on us and were very prompt with the service, though it was a bit chaotic considering the large group. The ambiance was cozy too.Definitely recommended
4
A beautiful place for a blissful dine. Though a bit expensive, it is definitely a place to frequent on special occasions. 
3
Highlights are the freshly baked naan, butter chicken and chicken tikka but you only get a small portion of tikka brought to your table , the rest of the dishes are a little on the bland side. It was extremely warm with little if any air co
2
I went to this restaurant to try a new Indian fine dinning place. The ambience was good, kind of awkward main entrance but still ok! Presentation of food was good, however the food didn't met pur expectations, nans were hard and chewy, dal was not good, service was ok ok! Prices very high, which i don't mind if food tastes according to prices. I would say it is a over hyped restaurent with nice decor but just average food
2
We have been there after an important business meeting, so it was an official reason more or less. The food was really good, but the service sucks. The wine that we ordered was not available, so the waitress offered us another bottle, which we did not like. Instead we ordered another wine (altogether it was some bottles in the end). We payed our bill and left the restaurant. After some time the waitress called me on my mobile phone and asked me to come back, because she forgot to charge a bottle of wine which was quite expensive. My boss who payed the bill had to go back and they asked him to pay more, because they said that the bottle, that the waitress offered us (the one, we rejected) was already open.....so what?? Why should we pay a bottle of wine, that we did not order!! And when she brought the wine, the bottle was NOT OPEN!! I was really disappointed of the evening at the end. I am not coming back!
4
Enjoyed a delicious dinner at this restaurant. Nice wine by the bottle selection. Wine by the glass selection somewhat limited. Service was prompt and pleasant. A nice setting for a quiet business dinner. Also great for couples
5
We were there for lunch last Saturday. There was a promotion for buffet where price was down to $29 per pax. However there was no compromise for food quality at such an offer. We tried every dish on the buffet table. We had good words for all starters, main dishes as well as the desserts. All the dishes were beautifully prepared with the richness of authentic North Indian recipes. Special mention to one lady waitress who was so kind and friendly to my little three year old girl
5
Our visit to the Song of India was an evening where everything just went right. The food was really excellent as was the service. One of the prize features of the restaurant was that its Naan Bread was cooked on stones as you watched and was the best we've ever tasted, even in India. It's sad to see some of the poor ratings, so maybe we were just lucky. We'll certainly go again if the occasion arises

This restaurant on scotts road is in a heritage house. Conveniently located with with enough parking space. Good ambiance. We wanted a corner table, they gave us a corner room with round table for eight. Polite welcome. Good service. Nice preparations and good presentation. Tasty food. Starters and main food quantity was reasonable. Their tandoori items are good. They have won best restaurant award in 2013

My husband and i went to this restaurant it was our first time to try an Indian food.. I was amazed with their Samosa i really loved it,cheese nan was great and Chicken tandoori..Chef explained every single dishes from their buffet they are very helpfull... Service was excellent and very attentive.
1
Indian is one of my favorite foods, and for past 8 years... this was one of my favorite places when in Singapore. What a disaster last night was. Took 30 minutes to get anything... then most all that came was either cold or cool... Tandoori lamb chops, Tandoori shrimp, cold.. s/b hot and sizzling... scallops cool. Chicken curry cold vegetable dish cold. Naan cold... lamb curry tough. Some dish explained as fried lady fingers - more like cold wood chips. Not fit to eat. Explained all to them... offered no solution or adjustment other than would remake... And they were not at all busy... No one came to ask how things were... had to track down server. Never again
1
We booked The Song of India for our family dinner as it had good reviews however our experience turned out bad. We ordered one of the lamb dish and the Lamb meat was smelly and spoiled. This is totally not acceptable for a fine dining restaurant. Even though the Chef came and apologized however the rest of the staff behaved as if its normal. The manager was all around however he didn't even bother to come and talk to us. This was quite a pathetic experience. The service was also not good. Very lethargic and not upto the mark even thought the restaurant was not fully occupied. The ambience and food presentation was good.
4
After having eaten at The Song Of India twice now, I would definitely recommend it to all those looking for a "fine dining" experience. The location is fantastic, set in a colonial style black and white bungalow right on Orchard Road, beats the fancy malls & high rises any day. The ambience was wonderful too. The food is great. We went for the set lunch once,and once for an a la carte dinner and the portions were quite generous. It was quite a filling meal which made it feel like good value for money. Loved how the chef had tweaked the regular Indian-fare, so that it was relate-able and comfortable, still tasted delicious, and didn't feel like the same old dishes one normally eats in other North Indian restaurants. The presentation was very good too.However above all, I think what stood out most for me & my family was how the management and staff valued the satisfaction and opinion of the customers and were willing to go out of their way to ensure everyone was happy. Overall, its a great place to go to for a special meal. All my compliments to Chef Mural and his team

I went to Song of India for a nostalgic dinner with my girlfriend who now lives in New York, where she is spoilt for choice when it comes to dining out. Being of Indian ethnicity, she is particularly harsh in her critique of Indian food, and rightly so. However, we were both delighted by the stylish takes on traditional Indian dishes, beautifully presented and graciously served by our lovely waitress Geeta. The palak paneer was especially good. The setting is gorgeous, and the location very central. Highly recommended

the reviews on The Song of India - outside Tripadvisor - tend to make it out to be one of the best Indian restaurants of all time. that's a bold statement considering Little India is a 15-minute cab ride away from the place. That said, this is definitely delicious, authentic Indian cuisine, offering the traditionally diverse menu. My knowledge of Indian food is not refined enough to tell you whether it's North, South or whatever - but it is tasty. But there are two but's. The first is that the food seems tremendousy thick and weighty. Although delicious, you do feel like it's going right to the pit of your stomach. And, the second is service - it's on/off. One person will be wonderful, the next will be aloof and uncaring. So, all in all, I'm not sure this is a place worth travelling to enjoy a good Indian meal, but if you're nearby, give it a try. that said, the prices are outrageous. As for me, I'd rather spend the money going to Little India for slightly better food and a more authentic experience

We went there with our friends and it was a nice experience for us.Food was pretty asmm, modern indian food, divine taste, value for money and great service
4
Went with my fiancÃ© this week , we had few signature dishes recommended by the waiter . The cod fish, beautifully presented very tasteful , had the butter chicken it was delicious with mushroom truffle naan something new , it was very different but very nice & saffron rice , finally we had malai kulfi again recommended by the server, finally the coffee , we will remember this dinner for long time surely I will recommend others . One more thing like to add service was quite decent but they must look in to there music could have been better romantic music 
1
This restaurant was good as have eaten there few times in past. Was one of my favorites of Indian fine dining in Singapore. Went there for a xmas lunch and was the biggest rip off ever, the aircon was not working. Only one fan for the whole restaurant. Extremely stuffy inside, food was terrible, a xmas turkey turned out to be a turkey pate. We ordered alacarte as buffet spread was awful. It definitely was the worst experience ever. There are many other Indian restaurants far better then this in Singapore, Rang Mahal, Yantra, Shahi Maharani to name a few.
3
Good quality food with nice setting. At this price point suggest you can find better indian food at some competitors (Tandoor, Raffles, Yantra
2
I found the atmosphere oppressive in an old, damp and musty colonial house with over-loud and frenetic taped piano music echoing round incongruously. The food is standard Indian with all sorts of decoration and a not particularly nice amuse bouche to justify the price. The vegetarian platter including "freebie" was acceptable as was the mashed aubergine. Did not think much of the lamb biryani. The wine list is overpriced..The food was OK but overpriced and the atmosphere was deadly
1
Went for a Saturday lunch buffet...The food just din't have the warmth you expect Indian cuisine to have!The restaurant smelt musty... The buffet was limited in spread...The cocktail did not justify its 16$ ++ price tag
3
Although the prices are a bit high, especially the wine prices, the food is quite nice. We had a nice, tasty meal, we left the restaurant full and satisfied. The service was good, the waiters were polite. ( one negative note though; the bathrooms clearly have not been cleaned for quite a LONG time....

Visiting Singapore from our home in Australia, after 2 days of Chinese and Malaysian style foods, whilst delicious, we were keen to experience a quality Indian Restaurant. But so many to choose from! We did not want to travel far from our Hotel (The Goodwood Park) due to Monsoonal Storms and The Song of India was a short walk away.From the warm greeting on arrival to the warm farewell on our departure, everything was truly excellent. The Lamb Biriani was to die for. Even Rick Stein himself would have approved. So if you are looking for quality Indian food in a beautiful property, make The Song of India top of your list. You will not be disappointe

I took the amex platinum card promotion and came for ala carte lunch. Upon recommendation by the waiter, I took the chicken tikka, spicy prawn curry (main), lamb ginger (main), fruit and nut naan, garlic naan. It was quite a lot of food for 2 people but the prawn curry is really flavourful.The lamb ginger is soft and tender and not spicy so its good. Fruit and nut naan is very good, not oily. I had to pack some food back as it was a lot. The amex promotion is for min 2 main course. Next time i will just come for the lamb garlic plus another main course (try a new dish).The garlic naan at 50% is 4.5, fruit naan is 6, main course about 20. Its not cheap but good value considering the quality after discoun

Hi thereI booked a table to celebrate a friend's birthday. We arrived at 12.10pm and practically had the entire restaurant to ourselves except when two other ladies came in to lunch. The service staff recommended only the buffet which was very reasonable at about $29++ and had to be urged to show me the a la carte menu. I had visited Song of India a few years ago and the ambience was much brighter and more modern compared to the current setup which is probably a result of renovations. We found it too dim and dark, and were glad to be shown the window seat although the the table was flushed to a wall instead. The food was good and I guess because the restaurant was near empty, starters were served at the table. However, from the moment we walked in, the place was warm and it did not improve. We felt rather hot afterwards. And that was a pity. I prefer the previous brighter and happier feel in the restaurant. Although the complimentary birthday cake 'treatment' was commendable for being well-timed. 
4
Nice buffet at lunch time in an authentic "black and white" house at walking distance from Scotts Road.
5
Really authentic Indian taste. Select the course dinner that suits your appetite for the evening and sit back and relish the tasty course meal that is served. The ambience is really very nice. Definitely a must tr

already the second time i've staied in this Restaurant and again, I am fully satisfied with the Quality of the Food, the mood, and the perfect Service. For sure I will have another stop when i come again to singapore. Thanks

It was a small celebratory dinner and we trawled the web for an appropriate place. Our guests wanted an Indian meal. Finally, with the help of TripAdvisor, we found what we wanted - and how! The Song of India is located in an elegant colonial mansion, with just the right lighting and enough space between tables so you don't have to listen inadvertently to those at the next table. We chose a 'set meal' - 'Journey through India' - which provided us with a variety of food from different parts of the country. From soup to dessert, there was much evidence of thought and artistry in the cuisine and our hosts enjoyed themselves thoroughly, as did we

I love this place..its quiet and neat place at a good location in Singapore... whenever i am in Singapore I certainly visit once... the food is authentic... love the taste and also the presentation...

We had buffet lunch here. Ambiance of the restaurant is good. service is also very very good. Food is very tasty. Overall i like Song of india

We had buffet lunch. Spread is good. Hotel is in a colonial style building. Service is like a Five star hotel. Food is tasty.

We went as a group of 13 ppl on a saturday for lunch buffet. They gave us a private room and it had a great ambience. Great Paintings and art works inside. It is a British era bungalow house converted into a restaurant. We all felt jawdropping on the moment we went in. The lunch menu had 1 veg starter(Tandoori Paneer) and 1 non-veg starter(Butter Tandoori Chicken). Both had very less oil. The veg soup was amazing.Then we had 4 varieties of nans(Garlic,Butter,Normal and tandoori Roti). They had 3 non-veg and 3 veg gravy. Then they had chicken and veg dum biriyani. They also had steamed vegetables. Then they had 3 veg salads and 1 sweet potato chat. Then we went to the amazing desert section. they had 4 sweets namely hot halwa, cold payasam, cold mango yoghurt and barfi. Then we winded up the lunch with some fresh fruits. Everything is unlimited in this restaurant. Incl tax, a normal lunch buffet comes at around $35. This place s very ideal for royal treats. They have only buffet lunches and not dinners. Dont go on a sunday as it costs $10 mor

If you ever feel like eating authentic North Indian food at the most awesome Black and White Bunglow just off Orchard Road, Song of India is the place to be. The food (both Ala-Carte and Buffet) is awesome and elaborate, servers are well mannered and trained to remember your order and not write it down. Decor is stylish and colonial. And Parking is Free!!But the best part? Totally down to earth prices!! Where else can you get these winning combinations
3
Situated on Scotts Road in a converted colonial villa. Decor doesn't quite live up to expectations. Service a bit pretentious - attempts to offer high class but doesn't always deliver. Waiter opened another (expensive) bottle of water without asking us first, and served the wrong beer from what was ordered. Food is very tasty, albeit rich and heavy with gravy. More substance would have been good. Bill was a nasty surprise. Two starters, two mains, a couple of breads, one soft drink and one beer - Â£80 / US$140! Very expensive. Would I go back again - No
4
first time I enjoyed dessert at an indian restaurant. food was pretty good. service was warm, if just a tad laid back. the staff know their menu pretty well, which is rather unusual these days. nice ambience. would come back again.
4
I always like to have food from here because food is good. Those who like to try Indian good should try here as well .. Service is good too....
3
Hmmm so where do I begin....Ok so we went to Song of India for lunch. The restaurant is housed in a nice old style bungalow on scotts road which was our main attraction. The building was impressive. We were ushered into a large seating area not lit very brightly. The place smelled a bit stale to us and reminded us of any old Indian restaurant smelling of stale spices( you will know this smell if you have been to old Indian food establishments). We went for the buffet, given the place the food was less than ordinary. The starters also weren't too good either. This place comes with a good price tag for just the location but certainly not for the food. I discovered the most expensive glass of lassi ( sweet butter milk) for a price tag of 13$! I mean , what's so special about that measly glass of lassi?! Not value for money and the food isn't good either. I would suggest it that if you want the ambience go thereabout in a place like Singapore which is anyway beautiful you would rather chose just about any place

We've fallen in love with Indian food since moving to Singapore and the food experience at Song of India is terrific. We enjoyed a couple of appetisers and main courses and were thrilled with each of them: fresh ingredients, uniquely and carefully prepared, and well cooked.That said, we found the atmosphere overly formal, the prices way too high, and the service mediocre. I should qualify this with the fact that my favourite Indian restaurants (that produce the most satisfying experiences) are local, mom-and-pop type shops that ooze authenticity. I just don't get the idea of a fancy/formal Indian restaurant.It's not that Song of India is un-authentic. It is unique, but it just wasn't one of those great Indian-food experiences. The absurd prices (chicken masala for $39) and generically stuffy atmosphere didn't impress, even if the food did
5
we were there twice..once at closing time around9.50 night and they did not say no and offered the best possible food they could manage the next day again we were there with a prior reservation.. we were a group of 12. 6 adults and 6 children being vegetarian and with kids we stay with dal paneer and rotis and they offer the best food we could find in whole singapore and most important 2 minute walk from shereton towers the hotel we stayed.
1
Had been here couple of years ago and loved the ambience and decor of the place. Their wine list had struck me as impressive and so we went again to celebrate the start of 2014. Been meaning to write a review ever since! The ambience and decor continue to remain the only highlights of the place. Service was terrible and lax and you would expect a place like this to have servers who interact and make suggestions for their guests but that was too much to expect. Food was mediocre at best and all in all our dinner here was best forgotten
5
I visit with my friend at 1june2014...the staffs and chefs is so humble..they explain everything nicely..foods is amezing...its my second visit...and everything is better than my first visit.... i sugest to try their naan bread,its so nice,they made for you freshly rigth after you order it,it isnt hard or ruberry.i can say its best naan i ever had..and always my favorite..i recomen to who want to visit The Song Of India to make reservation or come before its almost close,so can enjoy more dish and time to just chit chat with your friend or family in the nice and romantic dining area while eating lunch or diner ..

Went With the friends to celebrate the birthday of one our office friend . situated on scotts road near to orchard road which is very near to my office,i had heard about this restaurant but it was my first visit. It was not so busy they had few guest, probably we were early but later there were quite a few guest , the buffet spread had the varities with good choice, they served the kebab hot bread to us, they also serve soft drink with special price for lunch,Biryani and cottage cheese spinnach was tasty not spicy , naan was soft and final was a good masala tea which was a part of that buffet,i had a good lunch with the office friends in this decent place
1
Song of india is the worst indian restaurant in the city. The food sucks. The staffs have no clue about the food ordered. There is no soul or passion in the serving. Lousy service.High price for cheap naan roti. Please go somewhere else. This place sucks big time!!
5
This was a really great evening and Geetha was excellent in meeting my needs and seating us in a perfect location.All the food was truly inspirational and in a land where good food is plentiful, the Song of India stands out not only for the top quality fare, but also the overall experience, from the unique location in town, to the ambience created by the decor, Bose Sound Systems and Art work
3
Have been a patron of Song of India for the last 7 years or so, and even though their food is always pretty good our last visit can only be described as rude, bad attitude, unattentive, and totally unexceptable service!!!The service staff on our table had such a bad attitude towards us that we could not wait to finish our meal and leave. The frown on his face as he took our order was enough to say I don't want to be here?? If he doesn't like what he does don't work in the service industry?On our next trip to Singapore let me reassure you our regular visit to Song of India will not be on our agenda!!!

Fab food, perfect for fine dinning and if you need service with a smile. Ample of dishes to choose from in the buffet menu and great selection of dessert

We were a party of six and sat outside on the patio with fan for dinner. It's a lovely tropical setting and you have the antique Black and White building in view. I recommend the outdoor for a group as you can talk freely and gregariously; the inside is more formal and quiet and would be better for a couple or a group of four. This atmosphere is probably different during lunch/brunch. The light traffic noise outside might put off some, as the outdoor temps, but as we were a group there was no problem with our chatter and the ambience way over compensated.Food was fantastic as was the NZ wine that we had to pair. I chose some signature dishes and they did not disappoint. Lamb with ginger, Malabar fish curry and a chicken curry with very tender perfect chicken. They have a good veg menu and we had a few very tasty items as well. The aloo gobi was the best that I have had. The yellow dhal could have been more exciting.Finally the service was perfect. We were a bit indecisive about inside or outside and the team handled our back or forth without any grumble at all. Just enough attention when needed and all questions were answered including the history of the beautiful building.I had been here once before a few years ago and this time was even better, particularly with our group of friends. No complaints, happy to recommend based on our experience. The service absolutely added to our overall enjoyment.As a note, the inside was quite cold, but this is pretty typical for many Singapore restaurants.... so ladies remember to bring your wrap

My second visit, and it just keeps keeing worse. I am not complaining about price -- happy to pay this much for a great meal! But... The website pictures look captivating: the reality is humdrum -- the same visual brush-stroke of unidentifiable garnish on every plate, misunderstood orders, and food that ranged from stogey to terrible (lobster so overwhelmed by the sauce that it could have been bean curd or elk, for much as we could see and taste.) The staff are pleasant, but unless there is a new chef, new menu, plus staff training, this restaurant is on a dead end journey... as the fact that it was one third full on a Saturday evening would testify

Very calm and relaxing environment. The service is excellent. We opted Lunch buffet its good varities of food there. Being a vegetarian many choices for us. They offer varities of Indian Mithai at Buffet the reason may be we visited during Deepavali, Indian festival time. Its good place to visit with family and friends. It is one of the high end restuarant

Despite situated on the busy Scotts road, the restaurant has a charm that was very quite & relaxing after a long day at work. The service is excellent, with very courteous & prompt staff. It has an upscale feel compared to most other Indian restaurants, and you pay for that. The food was tasty, and so were the drinks. The staff doesn't rush you through the meal

This was my fourth visit for the buffet lunch with my office friends , its been consist good food & service too i should mention this, i likes the yellow fish kebab & biryani most otherwise all was good too. hope to visit again there very soon...

We have eaten a lot of Indian meals in our time and this was nothing special. It is in a lovely old house and the surroundings are nice . It wasn't very busy and we only went because we were tired and didn't want to go far. Mistake! We had a veg curry, lamb bhuna ,mushroom bhaji ,plain rice and a couple of breads , 2 bottles of water , 1 non alcoholic drink and 3 beers and the bill was SGD210 !! We eat in Virginia water in the UK for half that and the food was very average at the Song of India, no wonder it only had 8 people in there .We told our Indian friend in Singapore and he laughed and said it was for tourists or people taking business associates there .If you want a good Indian don't go, take a trip to Little India instead.Also the service was good , but no human touch

I was told this was northern India style. Everything about this eating experience was more than expected. The restaurant is in a beautiful old house. The service was great and helpful in explaining the dishes. The food was the best I have ever had. We had a number of dishes and all were great. I typically don't crave Indian food, but enjoyed ever bite.

I have been going here when in Singapore for some 8 years or more... best dish was the lamb chops.. incredible... except, last time they did not have any. Open at 6, and would not even let me in the door to sit down at 10 to six. Had to stand outside. Once seated, service OK, food just OK... nothing exceptional... Plenty other options in Singapore.. I will try them next tiem

Delicious indian food. Gourmet entres and starters, followed by classic average dishes.
Setting in beautiful as well as the drive up there.
Wine list was very limited.

We are a family of 4 and went to Song Of india for Thanksgiving dinner - it was delicious.. the service was great - my boys have nut allergies and they were very accommodating. If you like Indian food - this is a must in Singapore

i went to song of india with my wife on her birthdayand we enjoy our dinner like never before.we had tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala and sesame naan it was so amazing and so yummy, my wife still praising of the plating and garnish on the food. End of our meal the staff came with a complimentary birthday cake and sang a birthday song. thanks a lot for making our evening a memorable moment, will be back again and again............

This was my first trip of Singapore , I have been so many countries in the world as of yet and enjoy altos with my self, friends any family, but as we knows that we Indians always remains to excited about to have Indian food in overseas as well as other nationals, therefore we were the same as always seeking for authentic Indian food in Singapore as well, and after spending a several time to determined the place that we were looking for and finally stopped by the song of India 33 Scott road, as we entered in the restaurant and we found that the atmosphere was excellent as per out expectations since it is a beautiful setting in a Black and White House with attractive sculpture on the walls. The service was very good from welcoming to the finish, hence service staff was very helpful in making the choice and the food was worth the wait. Food was excellent as per our expectations from starter to main curse, and desserts, specially set menu that we have preferred to had, which has all the delicious items were included, contained deferent scrumptious and flavored which made our night amazing, we really amazed to find such kind of yummy authentic Indian food in Singapore, I really Would like to recommend to the all people that who are seeking to go Singapore and would love to have real Indian delicious food please donâ€™t let pass this great restaurant

My wife and I are visiting Singapore for the first time. We went to the Song of India today for lunch. It was easy to get to, located on Scotts Road within a short walking distance from the Newton MRT station on the NS line. It is located in an old colonial building and is not your typical Indian restaurant. Very upscale. Having read the reviews, our expectations were sky high. It was 12.45 on a Sunday afternoon, and the restaurant was strangely empty but for one other couple. we were seated promptly and the service was impeccable. In fact, there were just a few too many staff. A little disconcerting to see more staff than customers. We decided on the buffet rather than the set menu. The food was hit or miss. The tomato soup, hot, spicy and delicious. The appams from the chef station superb. The rest of the food, a mixed bag. The baingan masala chicken tikka masala, dal makhani were all top shelf. The biryanis, saag paneer, and mutton rogan josh pretty ordinary. What was terribly disappointing was the tandoori platter they brought to the table. Bland, tasted like reheated left over meat. If that came out fresh from the tandoor, I am hard pressed to explain how they could make it taste this bad. We ended up not eating most if it. The desserts were good, not great, and we liked the masalas chai served at the end of the meal. Was this a bad meal? Not at all. But when you charge $47 each (including service charge and GST) for the buffet (without drinks), there is no room for ordinary, and certainly no room for what tasted like reheated chicken tikka and lamb kebabs. And, I think it's a little much to charge $10 for what is described as "ever flowing soft drinks" (or something like that). $10 for soda which they tried hard to push (we were asked at least twice if we wanted soft drinks even though we made it clear we were happy with water). There are some nice touches that set the restaurant apart from the run of the mill. Like the amuse bouche of samosa chaat. And the desserts. At the end of the day, however, we did not think the meal was worth the hype or the price. We've had some $14.99 lunch buffets in New York City that tasted better minus the chandeliers and china

Surprised to find such yummy authentic Indian food outside India. I am a vegetarian and hence was so pleased to find so many vegetarian choices on the menu. The decor is contemperory Indian with a dash of tradition that suits the global audience just right. The staff is very helpful in making the choice and the food is worth the wait. Would recommend it to all people missing their homemade indian food in Singapore

This has to be the most expensive Indian food in Singapore, so my expectations were high. Sadly, they failed to deliver on every front. It was like being stuck in a bad sitcom. It took an hour for them to take our order, in that time a waiter had dropped something behind us and two staff were out with the mops. The champagne was lukewarm, the starters for ten arrived correctly for seven the other three had elements missing. The menus remained on the table until we physically removed them ourselves. The main courses were tasty but cold, the garlic naan was great BUT $110++ per person is a bit rich for just great garlic naan. How they keep going at these prices and lack of service when Little India offers a great range of food places where it may not be as fancy but it delivers on price and quality

We booked a table for ten people on Saturday night to celebrate a few special occasions. We thought it would be difficult to make a reservation because of the Deepavali holiday but the restaurant was very empty when we arrived at 7.30. It didn't fill up until after 9pm.The ambiance is excellent. A beautiful setting in a Black and White House with interesting art on the walls. This is where the positive feedback stops. Our evening was ruined by terrible service, cold food and a wait of more then an hour before our appetizers arrived.Perhaps the regular staff were having the night off to spend Deepavali with their families? The replacement waiters were untrained, rude and non-communicative. When our appetizers arrived, two of our friends were given half-filled plates and had to wait for another 15mins for the remaining items to arrive. The Champagne was served warm and the wine was not 'served' at all. We had to serve ourselves for the duration of the meal. The main courses were 'dumped' on our table without any communication and when we complained that one dish was cold, it came back 10mins later only slightly warmer after having been heated in the microwave. The service deteriorated as the restaurant got busier and we were completely ignored for most of the evening. Nobody topped up our water for the whole evening and nobody asked us if we wanted more wine. One waiter kept dropping things whenever he cleared the table because he was trying to stack the plates too high. The total lack of communication was incredible. We will certainly not be returning to this overpriced and arrogant restaurant when there are so many better choices in town

This restaurant is located on Scott's Road just off Orchard Road. There is parking spaces available. The restaurant is set in a beautiful house. You can choose to eat inside or outside. The restaurant does have stairs which are steep, there is only about 10. The restaurant is beautifully decorated. My husband and I hadn't booked a table but they were happy to serve us. They offer you water first, then they bring you papadum s while you choose your wine. Then you have the choice of two menus, a la carte or a set menu. We choose a fish platter to start with, I then i had butter chicken which was delicious. I would go back again

What an amazing experience! We have eaten Indian food in many countries of the world including Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and of course India. This was a beautiful dinner for two.Located just down Scotts Road in the centre of Singapore and convenient to Orchard, this beautiful North Indian restaurant is a large house with both indoor and outdoor dining to enjoy.The flavours are distinctly Northern Indian but even then have their own special tweaks of distinctive flavour. The executive chef, M. Mural has a way with Indian food that is to die for.Your meals are not your cheap, hawker style in terms of presentation, flavour or price. But you seriously get what you pay for here and everything from the tasting dishes to start, through the main courses with their Kashmiri flavours to the traditional desserts and sweets are magnificent.If you're a fan of Indian food, and I mean good Indian food, and you're in Singapore for vacation or you live locally and are looking for somewhere special to enjoy a nice occasion, this is one of the best Indian dining experiences you will ever enjoyThoroughly recommended and will be somewhere you want to revisit again and again

I had dinner here after waiting and anticipating it for some time. It is excellent food and service and well worth the visit. They do an amazing sampler menu which is amazing
5
My experience dining in the song of india is very wonderfull graet food with the great place and graet service,,,make me feel realy comfortable,,I realy enjoy my lunch there,,
5
My brother and sister treated me to lunch buffet here, a very random unplanned visit. I really enjoyed the food and will return one day I hope.Buffet food is good quality, a very wide range of foods, starters, mains and desserts.Good selection of rice, served hot just how it should be.The meat was very good quality, lightly spiced, correct balance of spice. Free from ghee.The bhajis were flavoursome and good texture of the veg.Little details like pickle, yogurts, raitas & chutneys plenty at hand.The staff were so lovely...I will definately go back
2
This song was out of tune. Bad service ordinary food. My wife booked this for my birthday as I'm a great fan of Indian cooking. Even though there wasn't many customer we were constantly ignored by the waiters. When we finally ordered the food it turned up late and incorrect. But the worst of it was that the food was bland and below average.
5
Had a great corporate dinner at song of India, with the awesome chef's tasting menu. What I liked most was the salmon with caviar, and at the end, the dessert was absolutely beautiful! The service was decent. And give a credit to the chef Mural who came to meet us. Definitely we will come back
4
I had the lunch buffet here. We were the only table at the restaurant. Despite this we had to continually wave to engage the service staff. The mutton was hard and inedible, the briyani was bland and quite frankly disgusting. The service staff is happy to sit around and talk as opposed to actually serve, when I walked in the host was sitting down and couldn't even be bothered to seat is. Overall it's a great option if you want low quality, over priced food and poor service this is where you should go.
5
We went to Songs of India for a team lunch today which was very good. There were a mix of us and the Indian team members also liked the food. The food was hot, tasty and fresh, the staff were very helpful and attentive. I am vegetarian and there was plenty of choice for me on the buffet - all the courses were delicious. I will definitely return again soon to try in the evening
4
The food was delicious, service was good though restaurant was busy. The dÃ©cor is charming with some unique paintings on the walls, I'm told they change ever so often so the next time you come there's a different look, grt idea. Was a bit cold in there but the staff were nice enough to give me a shawl. Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner

If your an Indian coming from India to eat Indian food at Singapore, this restaurant is a poor choice.. the food was pricey and for that the food did not qualify.. They had a set menu for the day as well as buffet and a la carte.. I am a vegetarian and opted for the buffet as they had lots of variety in the buffet, the food did not taste good and was bland.. My husband who is a non vegetarian ordered a non vegetarian set menu thinking that it will be different as he did not like the non vegetarian buffet options.. But the food they brought in for the set menu was the same as the buffet, when we asked them what is the point of serving the same food for the set menu when we could have just eaten at the buffet, they gave us no reply.. The service was fairly decent.. i will not ever go to this restaurant when i go to Singapore next time nor do i recommend it to others.
5
The food portions although small are delicious and will leave a lasting taste in your mouth..Highly recommended for Indian Cuisine Lover

Indien feine dinning!
On every stop in Singapore I also stop at Song of India.
Great food, great setting.
friendly service.
I will be back.

With a good reputation and dining in the midst of impressive settings, ambiance and expectation of a good service & good food made Song of India our choice for lunch.However the reputation of the Song of India was all tarnished when being attended by a rude and uncompromising lady-manager who refused to keep her word after agreeing to the requests made by us at the time of reservation. No effort was made to keep the diners experience pleasant & satisfactory, on the contrary we were made to feel that she was doing us a favour after repeatedly asking for the same requests. A sub-standard service & an embarrassing and regrettable experience in front of my guests!
4
Must say the food was very tasty , something we would remember for a very long time. Service was excellent. Kababs would just melt in your mouth. Very pricy but worth it as food was excellent
5
The first time I visited the place I immediately fell in love with the set up, it's so cozy and very romantic place, good for couple and family. The service is good and when they serve the food its perfectly delicious. I don't eat Indian food or I hate going to Indian restaurant coz of the curry smell but this place is different, I really like their food, everything they serve perfectly good. The dessert is awesome. My friends loved it too. I can say that they have exceeded my expectation..I always recommend this restaurant to my friends to dine, as my experience in this place is perfectly good
4
Four visits. Be prepared, its not cheap.Buffet was good, even for us veggies.Al cartes meals - the quality varied on each visit. The Indian breads weren't always properly cooked - but this seems to a be problem with so many Indian restaurants...Paneer was nice.The lassie's were made from sour yoghurt - and are in most places in Singapore
1
Tried their lunch buffet on promotion price. The choice and taste of dishes was really bad. Buffet dishes was almost empty. With just 2 tables they still made us wait for 15 mins??For an indian to have Dalia - as a dessert is worse.Would never visit or recommend this to anyone who knows how good indian food can be
5
The first time I come to the Song of India restourant is when I want to celebrate fathers day with my Employers family,I was falling in love with the Food here,mostly the laddy fingger fry and garlick naan bread,goa fish curry and chiken biryani is excellent,the first tastiest smoothy and yogurt raita I'm only found here,,,and one more thing wich make me can't forget about Song of India is: the first time I can meet my favorite Chef, Chef Manjunath Mural is my Favorite chef,and he make my lunch the sweetest lunch ever,,Thankyou Song of india,Thankyou Chef Manjunath Mural and Thankyou For Mr.Rayapati Ramesh(my sir) and Mdm.Kilaru Usha(my ma'am) for bring me to the song of india,this is my best experient ever in the best indian restourant ever, :) _El
5
Once I visited to song of India during the trip of Singapore and experienced the quality of food that we had here in this restaurant was dazzling, each course and food presentation was exceptional along with the conventional Indian flavor, especially starter and curry made us well satisfied, Atmosphere and service is quite nice & exceptional, for sure if I get a chance to go Singapore once again I would like to visit this great restaurant again…….
5
Though I dont spend too much eating outside, this time i could not resist , it was my lovely wifes birthday , so i reserved a table for us it was friday evening , restaurant was almost full , we were welcomed by hostess , escorted to our table. they recommended set menu but we went for individual orders, chiken bhatti was very nice and little spicy too which i like, my wife liked the prawn curry called masedaar not too spiced it was tasty. also we had yummy mango kulfi , our dinner ended with a surprize chocolate mini something like cake with a candle i dont remember the name which one the same hostess presented us. it was such a wonderful dinner , i and my wife could not resist to meet the chef, it was an honor to meet the celebrity chef Mural who was so humble though i have heard about him but i meet him first time , thumbs up to the song of india making our dinner the best , surely i will recommend to my friend
2
Stupidly enough, we can back 6 months after our initial disappointing review.Well, we should have not. I stand by each and every words from 1st review.Service is unfriendly and of very poor quality. Maitre D systematically advises you with the most expensive wines. Dishes are tasty but overly greasy.keep away, better food and service at neighboring Indocafé
3
I have eaten at Song of India several times and each time the experience has been the same so I don't think I will be returning. Atmosphere is quite nice, sit outside (but road noise and people smoking) as inside too cold and bright. The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced for Singapore. The starters are always fantastic and by far the best part of the meal. We have tried several mains, both meat and vegetarian options and they are consistently boring, bland and over-priced. I would go elsewhere for a cheaper and tastier meal
1
Very disappointed with our evening at Song of India. Whilst the venue was top class in a beautiful old "Black and White" home, the meal was expensive and way below the standard to be expected.For a start, two of the four main dishes had to be returned to the kitchen as they were cold. Its hard to understand how this could happen as we were the first to be served in the restaurant that evening at around 7:30pm. The tandoori chicken had none of the expected charcoal like edges to it and tasted more like a "stewed" red, soft chicken, after it was reheated. The specially recommended dish of "lamb kebabs" was cold, soft, red lamb minced patties and the samosas were huge but doughy. At $S160, including only one beer, this was a poor dining experience
4
A beautiful old colonial bungalow near newton MRT. The setting is beautiful. They have a lunch buffet at a reasonable price, please call to find out the current price. The buffet had many North Indian Dishes. The chicken Bryanni was fantastic. The service was average but nothing to praise about. A good relaxing lunch in a traditional colonial building. Not so busy apart from a few office types from the nearby office buildings.
2
Food is OK, but overpriced. However the main issue is that the staff are fairly clueless and the service is so slow it's both painful and embarrassing (especially when taking a customer).Lunchtime buffet is OK as you can just serve yourself.So advice is try out the buffet but avoid a la carte and the tasting menu at all costs

Last week I been to Singapore with my family for a holiday trip, during the trip we been so many wonderful places as well as Singapore known for it, with the exception of we also been some of Indian restaurant to enjoying Indian traditional meal, but didn't like any of them because of poor eminence and service, finally we go through some inquisition about Indian restaurant in Singapore by a number of people and get advised a few Indian restaurant , and were sent to the song of India on Scotts road, and had our diner at song of India, and really got aVery pleasant dining experience in the midst of gorgeous decorations and interior, with the excellence Indian traditional food and desert, each course was awesome with the pleasant flavor!
1
We were sent to this restaurant by the hotel, Royal Plaza on Scotts. This was a big mistake. With all the great food in Singapore, this was the worst possible choice. Beautiful decorations and interior but terrible food and service. We have eaten Indian food all over the world and this does not even rank with fast food. It is very expensive-go to the indoor food courts instead. One dish was too hot to eat, another dish was so mild it had no flavor. We consistently asked for water but never got it. The waiter was nowhere to be found. A million choices ina great food town-find another place
3
We had previously eaten at Song of India for a very pleasant dining experience however this time was a real disapointment.The celebrity chef served up two choices..... veg or non veg degustation. our group shared both but the verdict of all was the same: It was pretty awful both for the venue and for the chef.Each course was luke warm at best and it seems that the food was prepared much earlier and then heated by inept kitchen staff. The white wine we choose took 20 minutes to arrive and was served well above room temperature. The waiter was apologetic but it still took another 20 minutes for the wine to reach the correct temperature.The celebrity chef should hang his head in shame . We wre embarrased for our host
3
Staff very unfriendly,not one of them smiled all night, drinks took ages to be served very expensive $8 for one piece of naan bread.They would not call a taxi for us, told us to wait out on the street, all the taxis going past were booked. After waiting 20minutes A passing lady told us to walk down towards the metro station, we found the Sheraton and walked in there and joined the taxi queue. After about another 20 minutes we finally got a taxi. The driver explained that taxis won't go out to that area because they stay around Orchard road where they can charge a surcharge.Snag of India definitely not worth the hassl
2
We arrived at 9 p.m. And ordered appetisers and main courses with the request to reduce all chilli and spicy substances for the dishes of the children. As a result my son's chicken was not edible out of chilli and my lentils soup was not spicy at all. At 10.10 the waitress told us we have to order deserts, because later the kitchen would close. And we were not served all first courses yet! Nevertheless we ordered deserts and for ten minutes we were literarily piled up with dishes and with the last one the waitress brought us the bill and asked us to skip the desserts, because the kitchen had already closed and started to clean. All around us people from the stuff started taking away the tablecloths, glasses, etc.We asked the doorman to call us a taxi, but instead he showed us the way to the not-so-near taxi stand
4
I visited Song of India on a Sunday for a brunch buffet with my family. The place is very nice and the ambiance is very good. I suggest that you book before you go there as you mind be surprised not to get a place. The food was good and the buffet is well laid out and has a good choice of Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian options. The taste is pretty authentic and is a good place to also celebrate any special occasion with family and friends. It is definitely a must try place
4
This is high end Indian. The setting is very good and the staff present without being too much in your way. The waiters was helpful with suggestions, both on choice and quantity. I had an excellent Dehli ki chaat and a well balanced dahl. Only downside, it's pricey
5
The restaurant is set in what looks like a house built during the British Raj but is maintained beautifully. The food is excellent and the service is superb. We had gone with a large group and were not sure how much to order. The waiter was very helpful and actually told us that we were ordering too much bread for our group! The prices are on the higher side but worth it. The restaurant has a private room that is apparently frequented by dignitaries. The only negative was that due to the extreme heat they had not been able to prepare the classic "hard" icecream called Kulfi.
4
We went their on one of the Saturdays around 12 pm. There were not many people and buffet was just ready. Starters were good with options of salad, chaats, no samosa / pakoras. Main course options were nan/ rotis / dal / biryani veg and non-veg / raita / mix veg / papad/ pickles / chicken tandoori. Desert had burfi / gajar halwa. Plenty to eat and waiters were happy to serve.We loved it
1
Staff were unatentive and could not understand basic English. No knowledge of the menu, dishes priced at $30 with 4 chunks of chicken. The main courses came out cold and the staff couldnt wait to get us out of the door. If this is the song of India, then the fat lady has sung. give it a wide berth its overpriced and for a fraction of the cost you can get better Indian food elsewher
3
We went for a business lunch to this place. We were greeted by two monkeys playing at the entrance. The ambience was good but there were kitty parties going on of small groups of ladies. We chose the buffet option, there was good spread but the taste was not that great. Seem to attempt at satisfying everyone by the middle of the path flavours.Dessert of mango shrikand was disappointing. For a speciality Indian Restaurant at key location, it did not live upto our expectations
5
Centrally located in a beautiful historic "black and white" house. We started the evening with some nice papadams served with 3 chutneys. The papadams were rolled like a cigar. I'd personally prefer them flattish so I can get more sauce on them. But they were yummy.We elected for the "Journey through India" set menu. It was really nice. The starter was a very nicely laid out plate containing a small serving of spiced chickpeas, a small portion of hot smoked/spiced salmon and a deliciously succulent piece of tandoori chicken which was incredibly moist and tender without having that strange powdery over marinated texture that can be a problem. Followed by a beautiful platter containing a selection of curries from different regions. The food was lovely. It actually didn't seem like a lot of food when it arrived on the table but we couldn't finish it! I particularly liked the Rogan Josh and the Dahl. Husband favoured the prawn curry and the spinach curry.The service is attentive and the ambiance is perfect for a romantic dinner though equally it would be fine for a busines dinner or with friends and family. Good wine list and reasonably priced, although beer is probably the best bet with Indian food.The prices were, we thought, quite reasonable.The only issue we had was totally outside of the control of the restaurant and the staff. Just as we were finishing for the night, a particularly obnoxious dinner guest arrived who proceeded to make a spectacle of himself by being downright rude to the staff. Loudly berating the waiter, then the restaurant manager, and finally the chef about how the food was not living up to his expectations. All done under the guise of "I'm only providing you feedback for your own good". Sadly, some cultures think it's OK to be deeply offensive to anyone they see as "servants". A very rude and unpleasant man who quite managed to ruin our romantic date night
5
With rose petals strewn right from the doorstep to the courteous service and wonderful menu set for the special occasion....it was a delectable experience. Loved the ambience, the attentive service and was tickled to find rose petals strewn even on the way to the restroom!!!Lovely exp and yummy yummy food. Nourishing for the gut and and soul
3
Song of India comes with a pretty mighty reputation but the reality is it doesn't really get there. There's nothing wrong with the food per se but it just doesn't quite get there in the way that it should.The dining room and the ambience are great and the service is fine but it's the food that just leaves you feeling somewhat flat. Good North Indian cuisine can be found widely these days and Song of India doesn't really differentiate itself in any way or truly excel.The other thing to note since my last visit a few years ago is that the wine list has gone wildly downhilll with only a pretty poor and sparse selection available now. This came as a big disappointment given that Song aims to position itself at the high end of Singapore restaurants.You won't have a bad meal at Song of India but it won't be especially remarkable either and overall there are better North Indian alternatives in town for sure
5
Had a family reception in this restaurant. The ambience and experience were wonderful. The staffs were very attentive and professional. The buffet foods were delicious and fantastic. Loved their chicken dishes. The only missing dish/menu which my family and I would have really loved besides all the lovely buffet spread is lamb or mutton dishes. Nothing to complain but only to praise for the lovely dishes especially at such a low good price of S$19++ per person. My family was impressed by the wonderful service given by the staffs. Will definitely come back for more.
5
I dropped in unannounced n unplanned one afternoon n decided to check out there noon buffet. Very reasonably priced authentic north indian cuisine with a personal touch.My compliments to Hazel who served me and was a delight indeed. Even chef Rawat came over for a chat (after i requested to compliment him personally regarding the food) and was pleased to be able discuss the various dishes. Kudos!
4
Restaurant is set in a free standing house and has a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere. Service is attentive but not over the top. We tried the tasting menu called a journey through India and it was very well done
5
One of the finest cuisine in Singapore that I have found. I planned for a dinner date with my husband for our first anniversary, and I came across this restaurant called "The Song of India". First I like to commend the staff for an outstanding service that they rendered during our visit. They even made a simple surprise cake for us which I totally appreciate. The ambiance was better than I have expected it to be for a date, very cozy. Moreover, I like that they have a lot of different types of cuisine such as International, Indian and Asian food. My food of choice is in a very particular style and The Song of India has exceeded my expectation! I will definitely go back to this restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant for any type of occasion
4
the innovative new year eve dinner, tasty food and good quality, but pricyand quantity in 6 course meal fro 69 dollars ++ is too little . the service was quite confusing and no one new what they were doing. they overcharged the credit card by 300 dollars, but still amazing food and presentation-- but you had to tell them bring the nex t cours
4
Recently we organized a get together of family and friends at Song of India. The food was superb, with a wide variety of absolutely delicious dishes. There were several starters, a great mix of veg and non-veg north Indian cuisine, biryanis and sweet dishes like kheer, aamrakhand and classic Gulab Jamun. The service for very good and the event was enjoyable. I found simple non-alcoholic drinks on a costlier side and while the service was very good, would have loved a bit more of flexibility in event arrangements. Overall, the experience was superb and made the party memorable and enjoyable for every one
4
On Sunday , Me & Family went for the brunch we all the loved the food specialy varieties of kebabs biryani, one thinhg i would like to mention the live varites of chat was very tasty & yummy, my childrens liked it very much :) . i was very happy specialy for my childrens they liked food so much, thats why i will go again very soon...

I had been wanting to try Song of India for a long time as I pass by it daily, given its location on Scott's road. What a mistake. The resteraunt was half full on a Friday night. My wife ordered the lentil soup, which she liked and I ordered the Kashmiri Rogan josh. The food took the typical Singaporean time to prepare and we were looking forward to the dinner. When it arrived there were a pathetic six small pieces of lamb, which works out to over $5 per small cube and then to add insult to injury, the food had absolutely no flavor, none. Just the flavor of lamb. There was a small hint of heat that gradually built from some pepper, but it was almost if they took stale paprika and watered it down into a runny sauce. We buy a rogan josh sauce mix from cold storage that tastes far superior to what we were served at Song of India. Other than that the service was mediocre. The best thing we could say was that the atmosphere is nice inside, but that is about it. Needless to say we won't be going back. Who could believe that Indian food could be so flavorless. Next time buy a $8 can of sauce at the market and cook it at home

An absence of serviceA unwelcoming welcomeAn average cookingThese were only the starters. As main dish:3 out 4 wine selections available in the list but not in the supply. I ordered a Chablis at 75$, the waitress came back with a Meursault at 180$ as a replacement since no more Chablis was available, and without even mentioning it to me, she started to uncork...As dessert, at 10:30 sharp (on a friday evening) she came with the bill, requesting settlement. We were still eating our main course...food wise; nothing to say. Insipid, fatty, common.Friends, if a song, then then not one you want to listen to again

I was more than disappointed with this place. after hearing praises of it everywhere I decided to check it out and found it utterly pointless to my absolute dismay. We ordered a soup to start with which was supposed to be lentil soup and it had CREAM in it!!! I get the whole idea of making food rich but lentils and cream don't go along. period. then comes the main course which was equally disappointing. but the cherry on the cake was the bill. after being disappointed by each dish when you have to pay around 100 each it gets to you. so my advice is don't waste your money!!!

Mark my words, this is the best place in Singapore to eat Indian Food. Specially for the non vegetarians, I would highly recommend the 'Tandoori Lamb Chops in Adrak (ginger)' . It would blow your mind away.......This restaurant is very near to the Orchard Street ( I Stayed at the Mandarin Orchard and it took me hardly 7-10 mins to reach by a Cab)......though a bit pricey, the food is to absolutely die for. ...Go for it

Went on the recommendation of a locally based colleague - we were not disappointed. Was around 1/2 full given it was a week night, but staff were attentive, the menu was good and the food was very good. Quite high in "spice" (but they do ask this specific question so we're not complaining). Would go back
4
Just down the road from the Sheraton on Scots road this is quite a good looking place on the inside and is run from what I understand to be Local Singaporean Indians. The inside decor is very nice with service being on the hit and miss side. The meal itself was to a good standard and satisfied my curry craving :-) I would come back again but in all honesty I would be a bit more specific on the spice level of my curry
5
As you make your way to the resto, fall in love with the grandeur and class. You'd be welcome by courteous staffs. But these are mere superficials. Their set meals are the main attractions. Genuine indian dishes, you'll feel as if you are transported to the country. My all time favourites are nalli gosht, lahsoon jhinga, mouton, blue cheese naan, mango lassi, kulfi, and a lot more. Try it and be a fan like me! :

Some new Indian friends took me to this restaurant. It is about 2 minutes walk from the Newton MRT station. Food was really good though price is on the high side. Look out for buffet offers
4
Love the ambiance... nice colonial building. Food was great. The buffet spread had a wide variety and all of them tasted great not too sure which dish i liked best! Service was prompt and staff were friendly and pleasant. Great place for families, friends and business dinners. Great Value for money, will definitely recommend it to friends and family!Pimja

Was recommended by our hotel. Nice colonial building. Very good Indian food. Upscale - a formal restaurant. Most people there were couples, small groups, maybe a few business diners. Wine list was unusually good for Singapore, and reasonably priced for given the growers. Recommended as an occasion venue. But this isn't a cheap eats place like you find in the Indian quarter
5
Love this place. Bit formal atmosphere but the food and service is impeccable. Best item is the Lamb Shank which is juicy and gravy is also great.Walkable distance from orchard main junction like Marriott or Grand Hyatt. Epresently running a campaign for weekday lunch buffet at SGD 19.99 which is great value for money
5
The food was amazing but the speed in which the food in served is rather slow. I would recommend the naan bread with the fish curry
5
It was our first time in this restaurant. And i can say we had a great experience. We went there lunch time and we never know that they were having lunch buffet, so we've tried it and it was really good. Food was superb! Service excellent, though that time they were busy. Overall excellent

Me and my girlfriend went to this restaurant about 4 months ago. We had a deal on Amex to get the food half price and given we lived on Scotts road thought we have to go. Being British I certainly appreciate a good cuzza. However, we arrived and it was not that great. The air conditioning was on arctic settings (as a lot of Singapore places are), the setting was modern indian which is quite nice but then there was kind of chill out dance music which for an Indian restaurant was really not appropriate - even for "modern" Indian. The food was okay - the tikka the highlight and the service was average. It took ages to get things brought out even though there was loads of staff and no customers (Saturday evening). I must say I much prefer proper wholesome traditional indian not the "modern" fancy stuff and unfortunately that was the style here. I think they could really change a few things - especially the ambience and the service and it could get to a 4 out of 5 (also with some better food as well!
5
My wife brought me here for my suprice bday treat. Authentic north Indian food. The staff good at explain and suggest the food items.Wines at best price range from $65 ONWARDS.The outstanding part they play bday song and cake, very impressive
2
Entree was excellent - chicken tikka. Main course terrible. Lack of proactive service and had to constantly ask and chase. Tried to pass off Beefeater as Bombay. Good atmosphere but overall experience poor. Terrible value for money given the price.

Had business guests in town who wanted to try good Indian food. We selected Song of India considering our previous experience there. This place has a unique ambience than all other Indian restaurant, esp due to its location being in the old colonial bungalow. Each time you walk in there, the place gives you such an unique feel that you feel like sitting there for a longer time. Even though place was well occupied, we were seated quickly and attended to promptly. We were looking for something different from the usual Indian food and Chef Manju was kind enough to help us go through the various options and help us choose the food. Tomato Shorba and the chaat platter which we took as starter was awesome and just the way we wanted to start the evening. As part of main course, we liked mirchi ka salan which was lot different from what we had at other places in Singapore. As dessert, Mango Kulfi was the most suitable choice to finish the meal. Overall, lovely food and a lovely evening spend thanks to the Song of India team. Would look forward to next trip there soon

Me and my friends went for the lunch buffet , we tried almost all the dishes , good food with quite a bit spread , but its worth to have this buffet at such a affordable price
3
Would give this establishment an average rating at best as its ambience saved it for being poor. Overall nice presentation and ok service but food was certainly below my expectations
1
i have been to song of india many times in the past and was looking forward to bringing my parents for a special event this weekend.i made a reservation more than 1 week ago and was suddenly told by the manager on friday night when i called to confirm my reservation that they had not made the reservation. they did not even have the courtesy to call me back and then said that it was now full.this is extremely bad customer service and the reservation system is completely unreliable. i would not recommend this for a special event if you need to be 100% sure of your reservation
3
Having wanted to eat here for some time I was generally disappointed with the experience.Based on the reviews and what i had read, I was expecting creative Indian cuisine, unusual pairings and big flavours.I was disdappointed then that the menu was really just a selction of small Indian dishes, well presented and delicious, but I could have eaten the same thing in Little India from a banana leaf for 25% of the price.The setting is very nice, (a bit garish for my taste but fine) and there was an interesting wine list, however for a really top class Indian meal I would still recommend Rang Mahal or Vintage India
4
I went to Song of India for a Sunday lunch with my family, and we took the buffet lunch (S$29.90 per person, S$19.90 during the week).The restaurant is located in a beautiful colonial bungalow, with tables also outside.The buffet was not huge but with a good choice and the food was tasty and well done (though I'm not indian). The service was careful even if it can get better (we had to ask twice for some plain rice). Being my daughter's birthday we have been also offered with a very nice cake with candles. I can say that the total experience has been very good, with a plus for the really reasonable bill (about S$45 per person, a glass of Â wine included for me and my wife)
5
feels like home only its morecozy. food is simple yet huge in flavors. simply amazing
4
Yes, it is expensive. Usually, gourmet food is. The ambience was great and the food was fabulous. There was every kind of traditional Indian food, and a number of very tasty, creative fusion dishes. Try the spicy deer.The somalier was knowledgable and found us a great wine that was reasonable by Singapore standards, so the 4 of us enjoyed 2 bottles!The only weird thing was the fellow who approached as we were about to leave, and handed me an iPad linked to Trip Advisor, so I could write my review on the spot. I appreciated his initiative, but I politely declined so that I could reflect before reviewing. He discreetly disappeared.We will go back again

Song Of India started by a celebrity chef and located in Newton area (Close to Sheraton and just a couple of min walk)This place is in a Colonial house and ambiance is great. Reservations are strongly recommended as you might have to return if you reach there without reservation.We (Family) went there for Dinner and we opted for jugalbandi (Kinda 6-course meal) with some Chardonnay. The food tasted great and if not because of the 'slow service' it'd have been wonderful.Interestingly the wine combination was wonderful and if you are in to Indian food you know what I mean. It's often pretty tough to pair the right wine with Indian food. With the strong flavors of Indian spices, one would think to go for strong/blanc but our selection of naked chardonnay was wonderful and matched the light spiced items perfectly
5
It was my first visit to singapore with my family , i was recomended to visit song of india from my friend back india, when i visted it was an one of the best expereince i ever had ! ambiance was best , the food was great , servise was good ! i would recommend my friends to visit this restaurant when they visit in singapore ! i would conclude that i was away from india i felt i am in india having the good indian food 
4
The food is just remarkably delicious. Have gone there mainly for business lunches where the restaurant consistently over-delivers. The only drawback is the location is a bit far from the CBD
3
The Mother of all expensive North Indian restaurants in Singapore. The only glamour in the food here is the way they decorate and arrange it for you on a royal quality, king size plate. ( I did not say a king size quantity in food). You will leave this place still hungry along with your hungry wallet which would have been ripped apart by their bill size. So to all the respectable travellers here, kindly do yourselves big justice and avoid this song of India. There are many nicer songs of India in the Little India sector of Singapore for you to try and award a Grammy to

I visited song of india , it was fantastic wide spread buffet we had , i couldnt resisit my self to write a review after returning home , i am a lover of indian food and one of my fav place is been song of india , i was pretty impressed with spread inclusive of biryani, kebas , live savoury they call as chat counter and dessert ,surprise to see chocolate musse in indian buffet , it was yummy , it was pleasure to meet the chef mural also , service was atentive over all once more awesoome experience with my family , looking forward to visit soon ...

Excellent staff serving authentic Indian food, well spiced, plenty of different sauces. Good wine selection.
5
I have been in Singapore for 7 yrs and this is the best n consistently awesome Indian food ever...!The ambience is relaxing and the service is d best.U will never feel unwelcome! Chef Milind is a treasure.It is not cheap but worth every cent
4
We booked a table for 6 with friends and loved the outdoor setting they gave us. The Black and White which the restaurant is in is lovely, very nice decor. The food was great (particularly the fish), service ok (as always in SIngapore, inattentive) and total price not too silly. It was just stange that on a Saturday night there were only 3 tables filled - the place deserves more clientele.Recommended for a couple of group of friends, expect to pay $80 each plus wine etc
5
It was my husband's birthday and we were keen on fine dining and at the same time making sure food was good and quantity was good too. We always passed by this big white building and we were keen to find out how good it was. So, hubby's birthday was the perfect excuse.Drinks are slightly over priced but they have very good variety.I am a vegetarian where as husband eats meat. For the appetizers, he ordered the Chicken Tikka which he describes as exceptional. I had the mixed veg platter. It is very important to note that the quantity is quite filling. We were surprised because usually the quantity of appetizers in fine dining restaurants is not that great! Then for the main course, I tried the Hyderabadi Michi Salan - which was exceptional!!!! My hubby had something in fish [can't remember]. He loved it. Basically, it was recommended to us by the waiter there.We wanted to skip dessert but the they were so kind that they brought a small cake for hubby dearest. Which by far is the best cake I have ever eaten - ever!!! It is important to note, apart from having good food, if you dont have courteous staff, it could be quite a turn off. But these guys are so nice. They went the extra mile to ensure we were happy and made the date a special one because it was my hubby's birthday. They were kind, courteous and sweet.I would recommend this place to everyone who want to try great food, great ambiance, enjoy their meal and at the same time go back home thinking "It was totally worth it" :-
5
We had been to song of India twice, once for an event that we hosted and very recently for a family lunch. The food was tasty,the ambience excellent and the service superlatively good. The colonial setting gave an upscale feeling to the entire ambience.Special mention has to be made of Mr Mohan and his team of people who made sure all of our requests were promptly met and addressed in the best possible way.I recommend this place for any one wanting to experience an upscale Indian dining and best possible service
5
This was my first visit to Song of India. We had superlative food from Vikas Khanna menu. Great stuff
3
I lacked some fusion or creativity- too classical Indian. Probably great if you are a fan of currys and very typical Indian food less so if you look for some internationalised Indian food.I was promised mild curies, be ready for spicy ones - if that is what you like spicy original curries, this must be heaven for yo
5
My wife and I dined in mid April 2012 and were suitably impressed with the high calibre of food, service and atmosphere. The restaurant's website is curious, yet accurate, in setting expectations of great Indian food with a difference and served in an atmosphere of style and comfort. The colonial "black and white" is tastefully appointed. Service was attentive but not intrusive. They were responsive to special requests. A lovely night and one to revisit
5
Lovely place, settings, and the food and service is excellent, second of my favorite indian restaurant in singapor
5
My wife and I visited this restaurant for lunch on Saturday 17 March 2012 and had a long lunch which we thoroughly enjoyed. The service was attentive and we let our waiter give us suggestions of what dishes to have and just relaxed. The food was excellent and not overly expensive for what is a very upmarket Indian restaurant
4
I and may wife come back to the Song of India in january, after 2 years. The restaurant has still good food, but the menu is the same, without any inovative change. We choose a good wine and a set menu, with soup, chicken, shrimp, lamb, spicy yogurt, spinach, nam bread and greens. The restaurant is locatad in a beautiful colonial house, the food is correct and the service is attentive. It is a nice choose in Singapore, but they need to change some dishes in the menu to be more creative
4
The Restaurant is very near to the Orchard Road. Ambiance is good. They also have a separate room for group dinners. Their Tandoori Kebabs and Tikkas are just amazing. Dont forget to try the Kulfi.
5
Expensive but astounding ambience. Maharaja style.. Amazing food quality
4
This is probably the best upmarket Indian food in Singapore. It certainly beats Yantra hands down. They do need to work on the atmosphere, however. Yes, it is housed in a beautiful old bungalow on Scotts Rd. but the interior verges on the twee...and Kenny G just isn't the right background music for food of this qualit
3
We went here for a Sunday Brunch, which was good value and the food was good. However, they didn't offer the beer that was advertised as free flow and had in fact stopped stocking it. Instead we were offered Tiger only. We were also one of two tables in the restaurant but it did have a good layout.
3
There was only one variety of wine by the glass. Paneer tikka was bland and tasteless, although they did offer a replacement after I complained. Main courses were quite good, although the kootu was not authentic.
5
A beautiful setting, a gorgeous old building away from the frenzy of Orchard. As you walk up the access you are intrigued by the building, it appears to have history, a bit worn at the edges but that adds to the charm.The food is good Indian food, served with a flair. It is interesting to find that more and more Indian restaurants are taking the trouble to plate their food. A concept that is alien to Indian cooking, because we are not into single serve plating! However when done well, plated Indian food can be arresting.The chef at Song of India makes a successful attempt at "presenting" the food. Nice. Please keep it up"We were all vegetarians and were keen on the Appam and stew. It was excellent. Fluffy, warm, lacy, super absorbent appams. The veg kutu (a version of the stew) was just right. Mild and creamy with vegetables that still had some crunch to them.It is always a pleasure to walk into a place where the staff welcome you. That's what sets this restaurant apart. From the moment you step in you feel like a favored guest. Try it out you will not be disappointed
4
Old colonial house setting on Scotts Road. Has a lovely meal of some Lamb done Afghan style. Staff were attentive and knowledgeable although the waiter admitted it was his first day!I would retur

My one of friend recommend this restaurant called song of india , I went for the celebration of our anniversary with my wife , excellent ambience , decor , overall a very romantic place to have dinner with your sweet heart , food was very good service was great , we had a fantastic time there , if next time I visit Singapore will visit again definitely .....

If Song of India were a person, they'd probably be wearing shoulder-pads and leg warmers. It's a dated version of "up market" and it showed in the over-loud Kenny G music, old-school "dining booths", cheap paintings and unromantic lighting.There are lots of hip new restaurants in Singapore doing exciting Indian food. This isn't one of them. The dishes are mostly fairly traditional and the flavours aren't nearly as exciting as you'll get in Little India at a third of the price. Of course you might be looking for an experience a little more special than Little India, in which case I'd recommend checking on some of new kids on the block, like Krish in Rochester Park, that feature inspired kitchens and a cooler and more modern take on dining.A couple of other bugs about Song of India... our wine order came back as the right wine but the wrong year (without the waiter mentioning it), because they didn't have the vintage we ordered in stock. And the scallops weren't real scallops. They also had a real problem working out that 5 people required 5 menus.They do have a nice touch with the lamb dishes though.I assume this restaurant is coasting on a reputation from days long gone by, when choices were fewer. We went on the recommendation of a friend (who probably knew it by reputation only), but I can't think of any person or occasion that I'd recommend it for
4
Wonderful presentation of food, and excellent taste. The ambience is great and this place is very centrally located in a very posh and well connected area. Went there for an office party, which I had arranged. We had set lunch on a weekday, so it was well worth it, or else over the weekends this place literally doubles up the prices - maybe the premium for the location. Only, 1. The quantity of food is less, the servings should be bigger. 2. We had asked for a placard mentioning our office party, which, despite promising they failed to provide which was disappointing
5
i with my family we went for the brunch on saturday , it was my first visit , i have been hearing about this indian restaurant for good food ,service and the location, it was an great afternoon we enjoyed it, all the they served on the table they called it buffet on table. specialy my family liked the fish which was tasty and hot too, the lamb seekh with some nuts, biryani chicken , almost everything was tasty and unlimited .we oredered almost everything but small portion ,even the dessert were served in small portion indivitual it was good too . the server was happy to serve everything , if am not wrong his name was mr jaten , i wonderful after noon with the family with tasty food
4
Our hotel conceage recommended to dine in song of India as one of the best Indian restaurant , it was an unforgettable experience to dine there , service was classy , nice wine selection , good food too ! thanks to concierge who recommend us ! It was a wonderful evening there
5
My wife and I were fortunate to be taken to this restaurant, so I can't comment on 'value'............however, I can comment on everything else !!Firstly the service........pretty much excellent. The valet parking was efficient, the welcome friendly, and staff were not over attentive. We wanted to experience as many dishes as possible - our waiter patiently and expertly guided us through the menu selecting half a dozen dishes that went well together, yet provided contrast in every aspect.......taste, texture, colour, ingredients, and of course spiciness !! Served with delicious Saffron rice - all presented on a plate that resembled an artist's palette together with a piping hot basket of mixed Naans. Having tasted each of the offerings, we were then told that we could have more of any of them......so we did - all of them !! We didn't really have room for dessert, but we had them anyway - the Kulfi nestled well on top of the already full stomach !!My only disappointment was that the extensive wine list didn't include any from India - they aren't popular enough to make it to many wine shops, so this looks like a good opportunity for The Song of India to be a bit different..........I've had the good fortune to enjoy many a good bottle from the Grover Vineyard whilst eating fine curries in India.........it would be nice to do the same in Singapore !
1
I and my wife went to Song of India this evening. I had heard about the place from a number of people so we decided to try it out. For the entree we ordered Gilafi Kebab and veg platter. Both dishes were tasteless and clearly the worst we have ever had. I read a review the dal dumpukht was good so ordered it for the mains. Once again the dal was thick, gooey and tasteless. The only good thing was the garlic naan that was made fresh. I might have donated the $150 that I spent at this restaurant
4
Set in a beautifully restored colonial home on Scott's Road, a short walk from Orchard, Song of India is a great restaurant. I have been there at least six times for business lunches and no one goes away disappointed with the meal. However, the service tends to be slow -- possibly they are understaffed at lunch -- and I sometimes suspect that the special lunches are what was left over from the night before. But the ala carte menu has all the Indian classic dishes, portions are decent size (who needs more filling Indian food anyway) and the prices are not that bad for the atmosphere
1
I ate in the much hypted Song of India on Saturday evening.. Knowing a great deal about curries ( I have world wide experience) I can honestly say I have not eaten a poorer selection of dishes anywhere.. To fully experience their tandoori skills I ordered chicken and "lamb" dishes...Insipid spicing with no depth of flavours. ..I ordered 3 breads. A nan, a paratha and a roti which should be all recognisably different. Unbelievably they appeared portioned and all tasting the same!!!! As I was a guest I felt unable to voice my views in the establishment but determined to write this review to prevent others making a serious mistake and eating here..My advice is go elsewhere
2
Very ordinary food - just naming the dishes different doesnt make a great food.Poor serviceOnly the decor is decent
1
The Food was below average and the service sucked. For presenting and charging like a fine dining place they are so not anything like that. Would never ever go back.The location is great and lovely place but they really made sure you forget all of that by the time you leave the place..
2
Occasion: Valentines day dinner with better half. Reservation Time: 9 PMMenu: Fixed (set) menu.Made a reservation a few days ahead. THey called and reconfirmed. So far so good.Made it in at 9.10. Table was ready, not at an ideal location - but can't complain as the restaurant was fairly full.Ordered wine, but they brought out the appetizers before the wine and we were almost done with the appetizer before they got the wine out. Dinner was OK. My wife ordered the vegetarian option - and to our surprise, both the appetizer and the entree had the exact same grilled paneer (only difference being teh entree had a sauce on it. We weren't even done with our entree and they started cleaning the restaurant up (music goes off, tables are being moved back and forth, loud chatting between wait staff, etc). Our set menu was supposed to have Fig kulfi and chocolate mousse - we got a slice of watermelon and a small portion of regular kulti. Apparently they ran out of dessert. And all this without even a mention of why it got swapped out. Upon asking our wait staff - they acted surprised and were going to check with the manager, who added even less value. I dont understand why they'd take reservations for 9 when they know you're going to shut shop at 10.15 or so, especially when you're offering a set special dinner which obviously takes longer.  Food was nothing great - standard punjabi-type flavorings. HUGE disappointment. Been to several other fine dining Indian restaurants in Singapore and Song of India immediately takes last place
1
A true disappointment: what a wonderful location in an old colonial house and nicely decorated. The service was OK but became over the course of the evening worse and worse: it seemed the waiters had only one goal, which was to be done with their shift and to get home. We had a late reservation (9 pm) and were told that this was no problem since the restaurants stays open until 11 pm.... it seems however it was a problem for the staff and the kitchen. The next course arrived each time before we had finished the prior course ... and at 9.30 pm we were told we needed to order dessert now and also order last round of drinks since they wanted to close-out the bar. We were fully rushed thru a meal. In addition, the food was at best average ... there's much better indian food in Singapore then this ... so very disappointing given the high price of the mail ( 90 SIN$ excluding drinks per person !!!). Last but not least at approc. 10 pm they switched off the music...and the servers started to take their ties off.... and I was presented with the bill while still eating my dessert. I told the waiter that I found this to be rude and was told that they needed to close out the register.... no apology ... just unfriendly and rude behavior combined with high price tag made this a VERY disappointing expierence
5
I had one of my finest experience of Indian food here in singapore. This was my second visit and i must say they have lived to their status.The food comes immculately presented..hats off to the chefs...stunning presentation. rarely seen on indian food.the service was good yet non obstructive..the servers knew exactly when to come in and when to leave us alone.we had the 2 set menus and our wives shard from the a la carte menu as they were ona diet.ha ha!!The food is non oily, very light and extremely fragrant and flavourfullI highly recommend this restaurant for people looking for entertaining in style..its not a place for budget hunters.may be thay can have some pretty Indian girl at the hostess desk.....some miss world bollywood style...ha
3
To begin the food here is excellent evrything we tried was great... even the food we didnt order. The service is absolutely terrible we asked to check what a couple of dishes were and we got those delivered as well as our actual order, which we had to pay for of course. I had to shout to get attention from a waiter and literally throw money at them so we could leave. The service really ruins this restuarant as the setting is fantastic
4
The setting of this upmarket Indian restaurant alone, is worth the visit. Lovely heritage bungalow just a stone throw away from Orchard Road. Seating with much privacy, perfectly suited for entertaining a client or having a romatic meal. Extensive wine list with reasonable prices. Menu contains all Indian classics and many house specials, do ask the friendly waiters for suggestions, they will be very happy to support. Song of India also have a separate room for about 10 guests - we actually had a team dinner there some time ago and everybody loved it
4
The setting of "Song of India" is spectacular - it occupies an old heritage house in proximity of Orchard Road. Food is solid, we've been going there on a number of occasions and were never disappointed. They have 10 different types of Naan bread alone, a very wide selection of meat, fish, seafood and vegetarian dishes at different levels of spicyness. Excellent wine list, a bit pricey but worth it. Smokers will appreciate the outdoors lounge with ashtrays. The only donwside is that it's very very hard to get a taxi after dinner in that area so do make sure you book one well in advance or come by car - there is a private parking available
1
We went here for a special occasion, with a group of 8 friends and colleagues. The food was spectacular; a wide selection of very tasty and beautifully presented Indian dishes. The restaurant itself is beautiful, though we weren't thrilled to be seated immediately adjacent to the open kitchen. Prices are very high, even for a gourmet Indian restaurant in a lovely setting -- the cost of our meal (excluding wine) was S$100 per person. These prices would have been easier to accept had the service been decent, but this is where the restaurant really fell flat. Our server was hopeless; we surmised that not only was this their first night working at a restaurant, it was also their first night being IN a restaurant. For example: when taking the complex order for a group of 8 people, they didn't have a pad of paper to write it on; when I suggested that perhaps they write it down, they said no, they would remember it. And of course, they mixed up a number of dishes, bringing at least one we hadn't ordered, and forgetting one we did order. The server cleared away half of the finished appetizers, and then started bringing main courses without having cleared away the other appetizers. The server forgot to bring fresh plates for our guests with the main course, and we had to ask for this. The server cleared away all of the unfinished dishes (a significant amount of food) and then had it all thrown away, without asking whether we wanted to take it away with us. And the server was really quite unfriendly throughout the evening. This was service that would have been poor even of Racecourse Road, but at a super-high-end restaurant, it's really unacceptable. The group of 8 of us -- all local expats and food enthusiasts -- left the restaurant saying "never again", and I suspect we'll each pass our thoughts along to lots of other locals
1
Very good ambience and TERRIBLE service. The waiters made it clear that they are NOT supposed to serve even though it was a big group. Cold food and over priced

I don't mind paying over the odds if the overall experience is memorable. This one was, but for all the wrong reasons. The main issue is that the staff just aren't trained to serve customers correctly (a problem not exclusive to this restaurant, I might add, it is a quite common in Singapore). In and of themselves, my complaints are not major, but cumulatively, they lead to us leaving before taking dessert: (1) We had to ask for napkins; (2) there was an attempt to take my papadoms away (twice) while I was in the process of eating them; (3) the starter I ordered didn't turn up; and (4) despite requests for platters not include meat, we got lamb and chicken twice, despite pointing out the error when the first course came. Frankly, we could have got better service at the Raj at Biopolis and paid a quarter of the price we paid here

Date: 8/4/2010.The fisrt impression was WOW, beautiful building, but the food was terrible and terribly overpriced!!!!!This is our 3rd day in Singapore and still we both have upset stomachs............tomorrow we travel to Malaysia .......................get the bog roll on ice!!!!We are Indian food lovers, so we decided to try the tasting menu "Journey through India"......if India is like this food.............. thats one journey we wont be goin on!!! Terrible food, service average, dirty plates on the table, no polished cuttlery and serving bottle of beer without giving you a glass to poor it! For this kind of money Michelin Star comes to mind..............it should be 100 points in each department, but giving them 50 points would be too much!!! 2 out of 10Doesn't deserve a visit. Save you money and stomach

My husband & I have been wanting to try this talked about restaurant for a while and finally our friends suggested going there and recommended it highly too. The premises were on a beautiful piece of land, like an old black and white house and the setting and decor was tasteful. I did enjoy our appetizers and drinks but was quite disappointed with a straight up lamb curry that I ordered. The lamb was overcooked and dry and most of all, they were really small portions for the price we paid. For the 4 of us, we ordered 2 appetizers, 2 meats and 2 veg dishes, a few wines and couple of non-alchoholic drinks. The bill was close to $500! In these tough times of our economy, we can safely say that that will be the last time they will see us in there! We could've had at least 5 similar, if not better meals in another restaurant along little India. After paying that large sum, one would imagine that they would at least have proper ash trays sitting outside in the waiting area but all they had was a small tree stump. We were stumped! The very next morning, our disappoint continued as we were inflicted by the Delhi belly, spending an hour on the toilet

Good Indian Fusion food in a colonial building along Scotts. A little pricey but a refreshing change from the usual heavy indian fares

By odd I mean that we were virtually told what to order - and when we tried to order certain other dishes we were told they were no good. Good service except the dishes we were advised to order didn't work at all - filled up on very average chicken for starters etc. Also most of the food came cool - if not down right cold in some instances. The fit out of the restaurant also lacks any indian ambiance what so ever - and all this for quite a high price

I've sampled the Chef Milind Somani's cusine at the Vansh in Singapore. When I heard he'd started his own venture, the Song of India, I just had to try it.The verdict? A great place for an occassional meal but it still won't top the Coriander Leaf for me.First, the location. Its on Scotts Road in an old renovated Black and White. Not the easiest place to get to thanks to the traffic layout in that area.The service is absolutely excellent and the staff are very attentive as well as knowledgeable. They can recommend the right dishes and quantities for you.There is a fairly decent wine list as well. In addition, they have a special system for maintaining the wine that helps keep it really well.The menu is really varied and you will find something that will pique your curiosity.I would personally recommend their single person platter (thali). You can pick and choose your courses (starter, two vegetarian, two non vegetarian, dal, rice and bread basket). While it initially appears small, the portions are refilled. Try the fried okra strings, very interesting and tasty. And the Chicken Tikka Masala delights.The deserts are surprisingly average though.Be warned that this is an expensive restaurant and not one of the 'typical' Indian restaurants
