It is one of my usual places to go to for an authentic Japanese meal. The prices are reasonable and the ambience is homely.

We visited Tamako and the next next door Sanpachiro. They seem to share the same menu. There are affordable bento sets on Tamako menu and Yakitori/teppanyaki on the Sanpachiro menu, you can see the waiter bring the food from one shop to the other.Their bento taste was simple and felt like nice homecook food. Worth a return visit

A very simple place, but we enjoyed the food and the homely atmosphere. It's a good place for a satisfying meal at a very reasonable price. The service was good as well. They provided our children with kids cups and spoons, without asking for it. The yakitori was nice. If you are nearby the place it is definitely worth to try it

Tamako meal is your homely japanese eatery, no fancy dishes or out of this world mix ups, they deliver on consistency & hearty meals.Always have the sashimi, oyako don, ika mayo, yakiniku beef (to share of course). Good value, decent taste.Glad they added ice cream for just $1

People usually think of ramen, or sushi and sashimi when talking about Japanese. This Japanese style family restaurant (fami-resu) speciality is home cooked style Japanese food that is not too common here. The donburis with half cooked eggs with Katsu or chicken are a popular choice. The Japanese Curry rice is also one of the better ones you can get in Singapore, at a really decent price!Service is usually good, but gets abit slow when it's busy

Everything is so good here, services, prices, variety of foods serve, nice environment, bottomless tea, $1 for the ice cream, everything but the rice.Delicious tempura, pan fried gyoza, tempura shrimps, Japanese curry chicken cutlet rice, unagi don with egg and $1 ice cream (vanilla or matcha)! All are nicely done but only the rice, they probably mix with normal rice or just purely using normal rice. Nothing like the Japanese rice which is quite.... quality compromised.I mean if you don't mind, and not as particular, this is a good place to go

This kinda comfort place to one of our friends who's visited this place regularly. He brought me and my hubby here again last Friday night (5/2/2016).As it was our 4th bars of the night. We were pretty full and almost drunk. This time, We only ordered a small bottle of sake, 2 sapporo beers and 2 sticks of pork belly. We all got the same experience which very attentive and friendly service by Rika. The place was very packed at midnight and we ended up made a few new friends there. Total price was only 50S$

I actually visited this place on Orchard branch a several times in past few years. Why I never write the reviews? This place is always be the third or forth bars of the night. By the time I got here, it was too many alcohol been taken in my blood stream. The Actual arrive time was 10.30 p.m. The actual leave time was 02.30-03.00 a.m. in the morning.Lady manager at Orchard branch was nice, very service oriented and friendly. She sat with us to the end (3 in the morning today).Yakitori : Grill Miso pork belly is to die for. It was so delicious every single visited this is a must to order. Veggies grill also quite good too. Only try salmon sashimi in the past, it was fresh and tasty. The decorations was nice which just like other small Yakitori bar in Japan. The price was fair for food and drink. Bottle of big sake was 120 sgd and small one was 70 sgd. They also have a huge size which we never order as we already drank a lot before arrive to this place. Sapporo 3 bottles for.. $ (sorry I wasn't a beer drinker couldn't provides pricing but it was good deal for my friends) We definitely continue our support this establishment in the future.

Had dinner here on New Year's day. Service was very good. All the staff were patient and polite. The place was busy during dinner and yet, they did not lose their cool and remain composed and polite even when we made different requests at different times. They deserve 5 stars for this service attribute. As for the food, we had high hopes after reading the positive reviews. Unfortunately, it was a letdown. The meat from the salmon and tuna sashimi weren't firm. The teriyaki salmon was hard and not tender. The japanese rice wasn't sticky. If only the food was good

Came many time and never remember to review. Till saw on the wall to "like" in their FB. A place for a quick fix if crave for Japanese food. Fast, cheap and good! Place is small and it get fill up fast during dinner (open at 6pm).
4
Our relatives took us there for a late lunch. We arrived passed 2 pm, just in time before they stopped taking orders!The ladies have sushi set, the men have shashimi set (salmon, tuna & octopus) and udo (seafood noodles). All prepared & presented well, and the price reasonable.We'll certain go back given the opportunity.

I've been a patron of Tamako for many years now. It's been my go-to-place for not just quality Japanese food but even as an option, I always consider Tamako for their warm and wonderful service, quaint ambience and refreshingly honest meals.Andy, the owner, runs this humble establishment and is always around to answer any queries or share a suggested dish. Along with their free flow of barley tea, their food is served fresh and within a good waiting time. Try the Udon - fresh and thick. The soups are delicious and their sushi is tasty as well. Tamako goes against the grain of the usual Japanese chains or those with inflated prices. I strongly recommend this to those seeking a family restaurant that serves good Japanese food

Tamako Meal is a fantastic cozy Japanese restaurant that serves family-style dishes at affordable prices. Though their menu is limited (they only have salmon sashimi for fishes), all dishes are decent and service is great. Very simple, unpretentious and delicious meals that I always go back to. I think the star of their menu, which is not well-known is the Unagi Handroll. I always have it

Tucked away in a part of Singapore where time seem to have stood still, this small little family restaurant has a nice, simple Japanese ambience. Seats are limited for weekday lunches so come early or be prepared to wait.Food is home made and prices very reasonable. I kind of like everything I've tried on the menu. The tea is free flow and complimentary and has a nice baked rice taste. I usually dont need the wet tissues n return them for a discount. This place is popular with locals so well worth a try if u are around. Tip: if u cant get a place, try Causaurina Prata a few doors down - also very popular. Be sure to also check out the old fashion biscuit shop next door that sells many small toys popular with Singaporeans in the 70s

Nice little restaurant on Upper Thompson, is small with a number of tables and offers all the stables of Japanese food.Service is good and food is quite nice as well.Is not fine dining but if you want easy night out with nice food, nice staff and easy to find then definitely go there

Small place, a fair amount of tables well organised so that nobody is eating shoulder to shoulder with another guest. A medium serving of sashimi. It would be tuna, salmon and octopus. But we are given the choice of selecting which ones we like more, and leave out the other. A flexibility that wouldn’t happen in Japan. The lady who’s taking the orders seems to be the boss of the place. She’s extremely kind and sweet, soft spoken and smiling. Makes you think what did we do to deserve such special treatment.I like negitoro gunkan sushi, but can’t find them on the menu (help for beginners: menu with pictures of the plates). So I select some salmon-mayo sushi. Each piece is huge, by Japanese standards. And the taste is excellent. The nori wrapping is fresh, dry and crispy, as it should be in a good sushi. Made to order, obviously. Nori seaweed tend to get damp and flaccid very fast, so this is made on the spot for us. I also choose a Katsu-curry with white rice and big chunks of carrots, potatoes and some meat in the curry. The curry taste is very good. The pork cutlet is a bit tiny and dry – wouldn’t stand the comparison with the best tonkatsu you can eat is some places in Japan, but is reasonably good and as well freshly cooked. Finally, potato croquette. Two pieces, round and big (usually in Japan are smaller and flat). The inner temperature is scorching hot, so that proves again that they are just fried on the spot. And the taste is nice. Last remarks: the wasabi for the sashimi is better than the average, and surely top level compared to what you get in average Japanese restaurants out of Japan. The beer is a nice can of Kirin Ichiban, served well chilled, and with an acceptable price for Singaporean standards.All in all, very much worth the money (less than 50 S$ for two persons). A place where asking for a business card has a meaning: that you want to try it again later. And then, a place where they offer free books (Japanese) with such a graceful caption (look at the picture), cannot disappoint you when you sit at the table. I definitely wasn’t. A pleasant, well hidden surprise, if you manage to find this restaurant

Fami-resu or Family restaurants are a huge thing in Japan but they don't have many outside of Japan. I am surprised to have come across this cozy restaurant. The food takes longer than other restaurants to prepare but I think it is because they use traditional method of cooking and not microwave everything like modern restaurants. My favourite is the saba shio and salmon head. Salmon sashimi is fresh although their sashimi selection is very small. (Only salmon tuna and octopus). I am happy to see this restaurant on trip advisor as I come here every week ^_

This restaurant was recommended by my Brother. It's located along Casuarina Road, a few shops away from the famous Casuarina Prata place. Nothing too fanciful on their decoration, but service was good and they promptly refilled my green tea. Food was great in terms of quality and price! Me and my friend ordered a Potato salad and a tuna sushi for starters. The tuna sushi was quite different from the usual ones. You can really feel the pieces of the tuna when you bite into it. It's not like the usual mashed up tunas. This is really fresh! Potato salad was normal.Main Course was Pork Cutlet Curry Rice and a Shio Salmon bento set. The serving of the bento set was quite huge. It comes with a piece of teriyaki salmon, 2 pieces of fried fish with soya sauce stirred fried with green peas, 1 piece of ebi fry, decent portion of edamame, a portion of potato salad, 2 gyozas, some cucumbers and tomatoes and seaweed rice all for SGD14.80! Food was great! Highly recommended! Our total bill came to around SGD29. We will definitely go back again
