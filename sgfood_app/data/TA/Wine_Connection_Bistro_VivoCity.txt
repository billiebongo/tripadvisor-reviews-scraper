Had a business lunch at the Vivo venue. Good ambience and the food was great. Portions were generous for lunch.

Kid wise should provide more colour instead of requested. Example should put few colours into a cup let kid enjoy colouring.

Came here for my wife’s birthday and they were very attentive and warm! Special thanks to Lawanya and Ujjwal to their friendly and attentive service ! Definitely will comeback here!

Service good. Ambiance nice. Food. Not good. No flavor or salt in vegetables. Lamb cutlet was not seasoned. So had to use up lots of sauce to enjoy it. The seabass fish had salt but chunks of it as eating. Inconsistency.

This is an awesome place to enjoy different types of wine. Wide selection, that’s their big advantage.We had 2 bottles of Italian chianti over dinner meals of fish and chips, carbonara, tuna slices, burger and pan fried salmon over mashed potatoes. Great meal with family.Ambience made the dining experience all the more enjoyable. We sat outside, al fresco, overlooking Sentosa Island. Very good service by the staff - they were courteous and quick to respond.I’ll definitely be back

Wine Connection gives you a great wine menu and some deals for wine tasting too. The starters have the perfect combination with the wines on the menu. For the uninitiated, their menu will also tell you which wine goes with which food and so on.The staff is helpful and the ambience is warm

Pretty decent Lunch time menu for $18++. Greek salad appetiser was good enough and the burger was also pretty decent. Couple of glasses of a very nice Rioja at $7 a pop was also very good value. Nice view of the Harbour and Sentosa from outside. Service was a bit slow and confused but not unusual for Singapore. This outlet is relatively new so they may still be finding their feet.

Tired and hungry after work! Me and my friends decided to eat and chitchat for a while. We decided to go in n dine. One lady staff was attentive to guide as on our table. I'm just a bit confused that time what to order the staff Cath gave her recommendations and she patiently wait until we completely ordered. It was a very nice food thanks to her recommendations Kudos to Chef for our excellent food. Cath came to our table to ask if we want to order any drinks and we order nice red wine! We will surely come back and dine because of our wonderful experience. Thank you Wine connection and team!

I always go to Wine Co whenever I need my wine fix, and they never disappoint. I wasn't aware of this new branch but managed to stumble upon it, and boy am I glad I did. Love their wines, and I tried the prawn new addition to their menu as suggested by one of the staff. It was really good and very affordable too. Props to the staff who assisted us, I think her name's Cathie? Anyway, will definitely be back

Newly opened and the service could really be improved. You would think they would like to make a positive impression but having tried to pass me off with plastic parmesan cheese then wanted to charge me for real parmesan cheese for my daughter. Couldn't believe it. Never been charged for real paremsan cheese with pasta before.Plus despite no one being there they wanted me to serve the wine myself by leaving my kids and going to all the hassle of going to the wine charging station. Yet they had the wine on the menu and the menu did not say this. Apparently half the wine they can bring to you and half the wine you get yourself, but there is NO cost difference so what's the point apart from the obvious hassle factor. If you're mid flow conversation you do not wish to be getting up, queuing up, entering your credit card and bringing your own wine back!!! Outrageous! Bet they still charge GST on...the S stands for Service!Very limited kids menu.Such a shame. Back to Brotziet and Pizza Express next wee
