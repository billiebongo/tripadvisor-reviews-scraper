good ambience with good food! pork jowl and cheese chips are my recommendation. they are outstanding from the rest!
5
I came here for a short business lunch, there is a salad bar that is pretty tasty, and the salad bar comes free with any lunch set (14-20 dollars)
worth it!
4
Cosy place with decent drinks and food. Food portions are quite small so it can get quite pricey to feel full.
5
Went there on a tues evening, they had a good crowd but the crew remained attentive. The staff were knowledgable and gave good sake recommendations.Loved their Harami and charcoal skewers in general, but found the gyu tan too overdone for my liking. Will be back to explore more

Cozy ambience with a wide selection of food and sake, ShuKuu is the place to be for an authentic Japanese atmosphere. Amid the busy service, the staff remained attentive and the food was great.The Yakitori, unlike even those we had in Japan, was juicy and well cooked. My personal favourite was the beef tendon stew. The beef and tendons were so soft, and it melted in our mouth! They have a good variety of sake to go with your food, so definitely try them out too.Fantastic dining experience with good attention to detail (they even had hooks on the side to hang our bags). The décor is one of the best representations of a traditional Japanese food outlet. Will definitely return for more
5
Was recommended to Shukuu by a friend and it definitely didn't disappoint! The place is nicely decorated and gives an authetic Japanese feel. We ordered a few dishes, and our favourites are the yakitori and breaded oysters! There is a wide selection of sake to go along with the meal, which we highly recommend. It was a fantastic dining experience for both of us
5
We hadn't been to this area of Singapore before and were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and number of restaurants and bars.The outside of this place looks great and was pretty busy. We got a seat out on the footpath and the staff were really helpful. All the usual Izakaya staples are on the menu. Everything we tried off the menu was delicious especially the mackerel and the scallops with bacon
5
Spoilt for choice! There was so much variety and most dishes were so affordable compared to the other izakaya sake bars I've been to. I can't pinpoint a favourite but you definitely have to try the Rosti Mentaiko and the Gyu Ponzu, which is a lightly seared beef with ponzu sauce. The Wagyu beef was also extremely tender! The staff were very friendly and patient in helping us understand the different sakes and what pairs well with our orders. If you're unsure, they also allow a small cup to sample! I ordered the Sake of the Week (180ml, about 4-6 cups. Perfect for 2pax). It was super smooth, fragrant and had a tinge of sweetness to it. Shukuu had such great ambience and food that I would definitely be visiting again with more friends. Highly recommended!
4
Great food and perfect for impressing a Japanese client. The service was a little slack, but this was perfect for a business meeting where we did not want to be constantly interrupted by being over serviced. The menu is simple but the food was very effective, fresh and tasty. The tables were small, but very effective for talking over lunch
5
Visited ShuKuu from a friend’s recommendation. Didn’t did I know that this Japanese restaurant was hidden along the buzzing Stanley street which offers affordable Japanese food. Their menu serves an extensive range of Japanese cuisine, a huge variety including raw, deep fried, baked & grilled to charcoal grilled as well as skewers, mini donburi and soba. Also, the bar has a special menu that features food cooked with sake hence the name origin of Sake bar. This restaurant dedicates utmost attention to each individual recipes to the smallest detail, all the while using traditional cooking techniques. Spoiled from the variety of choices, the friendly staff had patiently gave us detailed explanation of their best-selling recommendations. I will recommend their two house specialty sakes, Umeyonado Yuzu and Sawanotsuru 1999 which was amazing. I love how it was pretty flavourful;, being light and refreshing yet bringing out a bit of sweetness. Most of the side dishes were less than $15 and it was pretty worth the money. We have had a pleasant dining experience with everything we ordered. Our favourites was definitely their tender beef Gyudon, and their mentaiko rosti served with a generous amount of well flamed mentaiko sauce. We also had tasty chicken karrage, and not to mention their oyster cooked in sake. Enticingly fresh and creamy yet giving off a unique taste from the sake perhaps, I would recommend giving it a try! If you’re looking for a chill japanese bar to catch up with your friends, I think ShuuKuu is just the place. In a nutshell, cosy ambience, top-notch service, affordable and brilliant japanese food, I will definitely come again
4
Service was very attentive. Staff anticipated our needs before we even approach them. Keep it up! We ordered several dishes, none really stood out. Perhaps a 2nd visit would help suss out some faves.
5
Very good authentic Japanese food paired with great sake, Prices were affordable as well. Friendly service staff who knew their sake pairings (ask for Mario!) - will definitely recommend family and friends!
5
despite being such a popular place packed full with people, shukuu gives top notch service! kudos to that. food was surprising and delicious too, highly recommended
4
Having just returned back from Japan, ShuKuu surprisingly did a wonderful job of bringing a similar taste and atmosphere to Stanely Street. We were greeted with a pleasant welcome by the curated decorations of the place and it brought good memories of the Izakayas along the streets of Japan. The staff were friendly and curteous from start to end and had went the extra mile to carefully explain their dishes on the menu. Their menu consisted of a wide range of dishes and interestingly even suggested what to end the meal with. A friend and I decided to try their dishes that were recommended but also tried others that were not. The kitchen was quick to serve the various dishes we ordered and they were dished out nicely and paired with good sauces.Just to highlight what we loved were the juicy and tender beef Gyudon, the sashimi that was fresh (and worth the price!), the mentaiko rosti that was well flamed, the tasty chicken karaage, the oyster cooked in Sake and the Yuzu Umeshu that was well paired with the meal. One other thing that I love about this place is that its busy but not noisy so its easy and great to get a conversation down with friends. Definitely a place I'm going to return back to
5
This is a hidden gem! This experience at Shukuu inspired me to want to try more of such under-discovered eateries! We went upon recommendation from a Friend and it blew my mind! I never knew the satisfaction found from these little eateries. We were first served by Mario, who was extremely friendly and detailed with his recommendations. The place was an ideal to just chill for a good cup of sake and some snacks after a Long and tiring day at work. MUST-ORDERS: I'm caught between 2 of my favourites that were recommended by the Chef, and could only be uniquely found at Shukuu. First, their grilled beef tongue. Like omg. I could taste a myriad of intricate Flavours that blended bloody good! It was extremely juicy (and Not dry) and The slightly chewy texture was just a perfect match. This is the first time I had beef grilled tongue and hands-down the only shop I will patronise for beef tongue! Like omg - they nailed it to perfection.Secondly, I extremely love the parmesan Chizu chips that was coupled with honey and tomatoes. It was like no matter how many I ate, I didn't have the "gelat" feel because the cheese taste was light and not overpowering. I don't know what's the sorcery behind this thing but it left me craving for more even as I type. I could literally taste the slight saltiness from the cheese and the sweetness from the honey and tomatoes. Totally recommended even for non-cheese lovers! Third on my list would be the "Chef's selection Skewers". We had the lightly grilled Mushrooms which was lightly salted that totally brought out the flavour. The Meatballs were handmade and we could taste the freshness from the ingredients - completely unlike what we had tasted before. The Wings were perfectly marinated and grilled - with a slight sweetness and tinge of bitterness from the grill. but the BEST would be the Beef cubes! It was juicy with great layers of fats that melted in my mouth. Unique choices: The deep Friend squid in squid ink tempura flour was unique. Although the flour was not as thick as others, I'm not a fan of deep Friend food, so I didn't really like it. My fiancé, though, really loved it because it was so different from the ones he ate outside. The flour was not as salty, and had great flavour. The hotate and salmon sashimi were fresh and generous in servings! Well-known for:Their most well-known for their sake and I can understand why. There was a bitter-sweet after taste that lingers in my mouth for the rest of the night. Overall, this was SO MUCH MORE WORTH than the more raved japanese outlets I've patronised. It was priced lower than some of the big names out there but Super worth the price
5
not easy to find if you are not helped with a map but perseverance pays!.a real Japanese restaurant with outstanding Sake.in a nice little street it have been a fantastic experience for a late dining (22:00)I would strongly recommend to follow one of their degustation menu they are excellent
5
Felt like I stepped into a hidden gem tucked along an alley in Japan. The cozy restaurant vibes made it conducive for catching up with family and friends. I particularly loved the Aburi Mentai Sushi and Kani Gratin (great recommendation from the staff, btw)—the flavourful textures melted in the mouth, making me wish I ordered more. Some of the other dishes were slightly salty for my liking, but overall worth a visit if you're craving some good Japanese cuisine. Excellent service topped the experience
5
Says it all. Amazing grilled meats without feeling that oily grossness. Sake pairings are on point.Service staff are especially friendly and are very willing to talk to you more about sake.Advice to potential customers: ask for food and sake pairing recommendations from that start. The menu is designed to be a sort of journey where the flavours flow smoothly from start till end. If you aren't drinking at least 3 different types of sakes over as many rounds of food over the course of the evening, you are missing out.
5
During the weekends, my fiancée and I came across this authentic Japanese restaurant called ShuKuu Japanese Izakaya & Sake Bar 酒空居酒屋. The moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was surprised by the atmosphere of the restaurant as it was as though that I step into a Japan town. The ambiance was perfect and the waiter was really patient in recommending us a suitable sake so we could combine perfectly with the meal that we ordered.I would highly recommend their Charcoal Skewers. You can choose the skewers to your own liking's, however, if you are indecisive of which skewers to get, there are choices to select a bunch of 5 or 7 different skewers which are under the Chef’s selections won’t get you wrong definitely
5
The food was heavenly good! Especially the grilled beef tongue which is rare to see in many Japanese restaurants. They had prepared it in a way that it becomes very tender & chewy.The garlic butter oysters are in extensive generous portion, I had 4 large oysters & with the combination of the melted garlic & butter, the taste of the oysters makes me want to have more. The grilled skewer also one of the most recommended food that I will recommend everyone to order too
4
The food is great especially the pork Joel and Saba fish. Serving sizes are a bit small but they make up by serving good quality dishes.
5
I enjoyed the lunch, wasn't too expensive for an authentic japanese restaurant. Lunch sets also come with a salad bar buffet.
5
We were served by Mario who was extremely friendly. The food was sumptuous and we had a good time chilling with a good cup of sake and some snacks after a Long and tiring day at work.their grilled beef tongue and grilled skewers were a perfect match with the sake. The skewers were juicy with great layers that melted in my mouth. The deep Friend squid in squid ink tempura flour was unique. it was so different from the ones I ate outside. The flour was had great flavour
5
ambience is great, it feels like you are in Japan for a second. I had braces and was worried if I have issues with the grilled squid, but yay! thats not a problem at all! squid was cooked perfectly, pork collar was amazing, sake was great. I'm not well versed about sake, however the owner and employees are always ready to share more info. The hot sake I had was amazing, and they are served in tiny koi sake cups! kawaii
5
Had amazing dinner here. It’s like being taken back to japan. From the service, the atmosphere and of course the food. The iberico black pork collar, MUST TRY! Oh try the beef tongue also! Sake service was divine, people at Shukuu Izakaya are very meticulous about their sake. Ask for a recommendation and you won’t be disappointed. Highly recommended and will definitely be back
4
The ambience is nice and chill with a modern Japanese interior design. Staff are attentive and eager to offer recommendations on the food and sake pairings. My friend and I had dinner here on a weekday evening. The most memorable dish I had was the Aburi Shimesaba- torched vinegared mackerel which came as a boneless steak sliced up in bite-size portions. The mackerel was meaty in texture and the vinegar gave it a well-bodied flavour. A must try if you like savoury vinegar flavours! What's a visit to an authentic Izakaya without having some piping hot Oden? The traditional soup came slightly sweetened from the dashi-based soy and it did not disappoint. It was served hot with daikon, egg, konnyaku and Japanese fishcakes. We also tried their Ika Kuro-Age which was deep-fried squid in squid ink batter (fried to perfection). We had the chef's selection of skewered meats and the crab gratin with mentaiko which came in a crab shell stuffed with cheesy crab goodness. The food was paired perfectly with some premium sake that was easy to drink and it brought out the umami richness in the food
5
Hidden on Stanley Street, SkuKuu is a cozy restaurant that brings out the spirit and atmosphere of Japanese dining. The restaurant itself feels like it has been curated to bring the focus and attention to the dining experience and of course, the food. The food selection is amazing, starting with a large choice of appetizers all the way to the choice of sake. With traditional dishes, all the way to crafted dishes, the restaurant has definitely placed its focus on creating a memorable dining experience for its diners. I would highly recommend first-time diners to try what has been recommended by the waiters and chef. I really enjoyed the Ika "Kuro" Age (Surume Squid in ink) and their Reba Shoyuzuke (Marinated chicken liver in soy sauce), both recommended by the owner of the restaurant. I have never ever been a fan of chicken liver, but this dish was something I would see myself ordering the next time I’m around. It was deeply marinated and perfectly cooked, enough to remove the bitter-chalky taste of liver. Take a leap of faith and give this dish a try.Last but not least, cleanse your palate with a sip of sake. The combination of flavorful dishes with the restaurant's recommended choice of sake is perfect for an after-work chill evening or a Friday night date
5
This is one legit izakaya that's got excellent sakes and delectable dishes. The menu is a line-up of traditional izakaya small plates and fusion creations (crab gratin/rosti mentaiko), all of which would go very well with the curated range of sake and shochu.The best part? The owners/staff actually know their sakes/shochus and cuisine, and are more than happy to help you out to choose a sake or explain the menu. Try these: surume squid in squid ink batter, the premium sakes (very affordable, great clean finish), oden, grilled skewer
4
Ask a friend out to dinner, and as you’re asking for suggestions, ‘Japanese’ comes up and the one thing that comes to mind, at least for me; are not many of these restaurants trying ever so hard to match Japan’s ever exquisite taste, only to fall short?Having tasted food from Japan itself, it has been difficult for me to find a place within the island itself that remind me of the first time I set foot in the land of the rising sun. Shukuu has relived that sentiment with me once again. The fact that the restaurant staff were patient enough to share their knowledge about the items in the menu, and how thoroughly they were able to highlight the key dishes which would eventually match the sake they would serve later on had me beyond delighted, or was it the other way around? They were just so well paired! We move on to the food, on most occasions, restaurants habitually reserve their best dishes for somewhere in the middle of your meal, but Shukuu kept it consistent from the very start! With the Tako Wasabi (Wasabi-marinated Octopus) to the five-piece yakitori set, along with all the dishes in-between, have kept me on the edge of my seat, always anticipating what came next with each dish. Minus the factor that it was my first time in the restaurant, the food served here could prove to be a staple favourite amongst the people who patronize this place. Yes, food can always be interesting the first time we make an encounter with it, but what matters most is whether or not the same dish can draw back a following. I believe i’ve been deliriously enraptured into a food haven. A must for a return, not just a visit
5
Is a Must to try out their Pork Jowl. Pairs up with runny eggs and Savoury sauce. A perfect match! The meat was very tender. Feels like it's melting in my mouth! Chef must be putting in lots of effort to prepare it. Kawa ebi-age was a HIT for me too. River shrimps was crispy and crunchy. I've have been popping up nearly the whole bowl while chatting with my Friend. Addictive! Overall, ambience was good. Definitely will recommend friends to here.
5
Good vibe, great staff, extensive sake offerings and good food - ShuKuu Izakaya scores highly all round. Special mention goes to the friendly, knowledgeable and passionate staff!
5
First things first, the service at this place is tiptop. Even though we were 1.5 hours late for our reservation due to life, the guy called us and held the table for us so that we could still enjoy a good Friday night out. The place is nice and cosy, and super accessible thanks to the DTL. Menu is extensive and the food is V GOOD for what we expected to be a sake place I.e. Legit sashimi, this amazing crab mentaiko which came in a crab shell, grilled squid, tako wasabi mmmmmm, grilled shiitake, grilled chicken wings etc etc. everything else was actually very yummy apart from the tori kariage which was normal. Food wise we were very pleased. The sake was the highlight of the meal because Luis would look at what we have ordered and then recommend a suitable sake to match our food. He brought along three bottles for us to choose and explained the sake in great detail, going into the notes, aromas, taste, origin, and even a story of how he visited this special sake brewery run by father&son, and that shukuu is the only place to have this sake, and it is currently his favourite. Needless to say, we were bought over by his charming words and ordered that - WHICH WAS LIFE CHANGING. All along I thought I've been drinking pretty good sake but then I tried this and I was brought to another dimension. The sake was sweet (not usually my fav) but it was amazing and I am ill-equipped to properly describe how good it was, but pls try it!!! also intrigued by how they served sake in wine glasses so that we can better smell the sake. please visit this place and have a conversation w Luis about sake because it was most enlightening and we are already looking forward to our next visit!
5
Been there not once but twice already within the month. Love the food and the cosy ambience of the restaurant. It's a good place to chill and catch up with friends whilst enjoying rather authentic Japanese cuisine. Tried the Gyudon, Salmon sashimi, Chef's Grill, Chizu chips and many more, which I missed out the previous time I was there and the standard of the food served is good and quite consistent. Will be back for more soon
4
The Rosti Mentai is really worth every penny! The thinly shredded potatoes were surprisingly crunchy, and not overly oily(hence avoiding the feeling of jerlak). The amount of mentaiko sauce used is just right for it did not overshadow the flavours of the , but rather provided an interesting umami flavour. Try the Pork Jowl ($18) if you crave for or want to upload instagrammy photos. The presentation is not only beautiful, but the meat is just so tender that it literally melts in the . The pork jowl is indeed a dish that satisfies both the eyes and palates! Overall, my friend and I enjoyed the food, service and ambience, and will definitely be back for more
5
I came with my friends and we had a really good time here. The ambience was cosy and the service was excellent. One of the staff even patiently went through the menu to recommend their popular dishes to us. We went during dinner time and even though there were alot of people, food was still served promptly too so we didn't have to wait long. The presentation of the food was well done, and the ingredients were of premium quality. They come in small portions, allowing us to try other specialties as well. Personally, my favorite were the crab mentaiko gratin, the deep fried squid ink batter and the spicy salmon don. We had Sake as well, which went really well together with the food!Overall, I had a great time there and I would definitely come back and recommend my friends to come
4
I first encounter about the place would be the staff. They are very friendly and attentive to our belongings. I went there with my friends last week about 6pm in the evening. The crowd started strolling in about 7-7ish. Big crowds stood in and makes the place feel so alive. That moment, I felt like Iâ€™m in some bar in Japan.What I would recommend would probably the crab gratin with mentaiko shaped with the crab style with macaroni. Really interesting concept. Small portion but good quality. They served the dishes hot and the presentation was good and ready for camera.Second dish that I will recommend will definitely be the Sureme squid in ink batter that comes with the mayonnaise. Perfect combination to pair with the sake. Lastly, we had the tuna belly rice bowl to fill our tummy. It was cut in small chunks served neatly and easy for consumption. Love the taste of it as it melts in the mouth.If you love Japanese food, try this place
4
We went on a weekday evening and the place wasn't that packed. There was a large variety of food, we tried the Gyu Ponzu, Hotate Mentai, 7 skewers, Bacon Hotate and two dons (spicy salmon and gyu). Everything was good except maybe the gyudon and skewers. The draft beer and iced hojicha were also great tasting. The prices could be more affordable though, we probably wouldn't go back again unless the prices drop
5
I have visited a couple of times and Shukuu have yet to disappoint me. I love how consistent they are with their food quality and service. Some of the hidden gems on the menu include their deep-fried homemade minced pork cutlet and crab gratin with mentaiko! Anyway, at Shukuu, there's such a thing called sake pairing where they recommend the type of sake to consume alongside the dishes ordered. I must say the recommended sake complemented the pork cutlet so well! I will definitely drop by soon for another round of great food and sake! Keep it up Shukuu
5
I have often passed by ShuKuu but it never crossed my thoughts to dine there till recently. The menu had a good selection of choices and I was impressed with the selection of house specialties that were served. The majority of the food came in appetiser sized portions which gives diners a chance to take their time savouring the flavours. I would definitely recommend ShuKuu for an experience in fine tasting and quality dining
5
Had a great experience here! The Food at ShuKuu was exceptionally delicious with premium quality ingredients, excellent service, and a cosy atmosphere. My favourite dishes would definitely be the charcoal skewers, deep-fried squid ink batter and the Gyu Ponzu beef that captured the citrus flavour. Highly recommend this place
4
Very nice food and sake. Nice jap cuisine. Only down side is that it is very crowded even on a wed night so it was very noisy.
5
And great service! Cosy, characterful sushi bar in a lovely neighbourhood. I love my sashimi, and have eaten all over the world, but this is up there.
Guilty secret - Parmesan chips. Yum!
Highly recommended
4
Dining at Shukuu made me feel like I am in Japan. The ambiance its nice and chill. Food for me its not fantastically good but my favourite dishes its the Yaki Gyu Tan "Beef tongue" and Gyu ponzu beef that brings out the citric of the flavour that is good for appetisers. Staffs are very friendly and helpful as well, for explaining each of the dishes on the menu. Overall good experience
5
Food was exquisite. Love love love the Spicy Salmon don that paired so well with Yaki Guy Tan (Premium grilled beef tongue). Once you get that combination, your life will change dramatically. Waiter and staff were really friendly and the food was served quick and promptly. Awesome atmosphere. Check it out, you won’t regret it
5
Dined here recently while over for the F1 GP. A cosy restaurant, a short walk from where were staying in the CBD. The selection and quality of food was excellent and served by friendly and helpful staff. We had a good talk about sake with one of the waiters which was great, and tried 3 different ones while there, very nice indeed
5
Restaurant is crowded mainly for weekdays as fillup with CBD people. Managed to reserve table for a good dinner! Its quite noisy due to small area, but still cozy to have a Jap feast. Good service by the male staff to intro us the popular dishes & a chill sake! Its mostly tasty, although the portion is small like tapas, U can advance inquire & check for larger shares. Can check the menu from their wedsite
5
Came here with a buddy to celebrate his birthday early. As usual, excellent food, fantastic sake recommendation and warm service! Getting some attention might be difficult at times but good things come to those who wait! Besides, what's the rush when you have a fantastic bottle of sake to sip on and the best company? Bought some Chope vouchers before arriving and it saved me 10% off the total bill! Any savings is good savings! Definitely coming back again soon
3
The portions of food is very little, food wise is average, don't have a dish which is outstanding. Quite expensive given the small portion
5
Visited last week for a belated birthday celebration! Bought some Chope vouchers and saved 10% from the $200 value of vouchers! The food was excellent as usual. And a slight departure from the norm of having sake or highballs. Ordered a 3 litre beer tower and it went perfectly with the many nibbles we ordered. Huge fan of their yakitori! Service prompt and friendly as always! My go-to place for a noisy evening of laughter with close friends
5
Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere at Shukuu Izakaya. Almost felt like my friends and I had stepped into Japan! Mackerel fans, I highly recommend their Aburi Shimesaba - one of the best I've had. We enjoyed their skewers too (bacon scallop was particularly good). I'd definitely be back
5
I've been to ShuKuu Izakaya a good number of times, and service and food is always excellent. The atmosphere is cosy and lively, but still possible to have conversations at a comfortable level.
4
food is good, complimentary salad, price is reasonable, atmosphere is not bad and service is good too
5
We made a last minute reservation via Chope (love Chope!) based on past reviews and were not disappointed. We love everything about the place - the friendly service, knowledgeable and flexible staff, great food, sake and vibe. An excellent Izakaya!
3
Food was good but on the high end in terms of price. Ordered the set menu (for 4 pax) and portions were rather small.
5
Cosy atmosphere/ambience, quiet enough for our group of 7 to have a conversation over lunch. Very good service. Excellent food at a reasonable price.
4
A hidden gem in the Tanjong Pagar area that is saturated with food choices, Shukuu Izakaya is definitely worth a visit. Stepping into the restaurant transports you to Japan, with carefully curated furniture and décor to create the ambience. The food served does not disappoint, either. I would highly recommend the sashimi-grade scallop that was seared to perfection. Another favourite was the Aburi Shimesaba – marinated in vinegar, the saba did not have even the slightest ‘fishy’ taste that one would expect. It was tender and easy on the palate, a must-try for all seafood lovers
5
Love this place! We spent about $30/pax here, and one of my favourites has to be their Mentaiko Rosti and Kani Gratin (only $8 and $7 respectively!) Another dish that left me a deep impression has got to be their Yasai Miso (veggies with their homemade Miso dip) What seemed to be a pretty normal dish turned out to be really addictive and we almost polished the entire bowl of vegetables (i dont even like eating vege in the first place). I later tried to dip other stuffs into the miso dip and it went so well together as well! Lastly, Pork Jowl Charshu is the the killer dish that satisfied everyone's tastebud. Highly recommend everyone to try
5
This place is a gem! Great ambience full of Japanese vibes, awesome food and sake, friendly staff, accessible location for the downtown working crowd, and perfect for some catching up with friends.Food wise, I highly recommend the mentaiko rosti and gratin, we polished it off entirely and almost ordered second servings if not for the many other dishes coming up. Also enjoyed the pork jowl char shu that melts in your mouth. Oden soup at the end was warm and comforting and reminded me of Japan. There's also a good variety on the menu that's great for sharing.Only regret? We wished the portions were bigger haha. Definitely be back for more
5
Went for the first time after work, Great Food! Great Service! Reasonable prices. I will definitely be coming back regularly! Go with at least a group of 4 so you can order more dishes - we thoroughly enjoyed every dish! Would recommend to try their Yasai Miso - it's a unique mix of Japanese and local taste. Their Pork Jowl Chashu is just a must try - the meat is so flavourful and tender. Their Kani Gratin is another must try - a unique and delicious crab gratin with mentaikoAnother must try is their Ika "Kuro'-Age - sotong in squid ink batter - YUMS!!The restaurant is easily accessible, in the middle of downtown, and has a warm cozy ambience to it - with unique hand painted designs on the outside
5
My first time here and it shall be my go-to from now on! Cosy and inviting, and in the middle of downtown. We visited as a group of 4, small celebration, and we've ordered about 8 sharing dishes. A very well crafted menu (not huge, but very complete) with everything you can wish for in a Izakaya. From seafood to prized meats. The price is very reasonable, and the food quality is way above expectations. Good to visit in groups as you'll be able to order a lot more and sample more :DWe've enjoyed every single dish, I will particularly recommend the squid ink calamari, iberico charshu, and the 6pc Oden soup dish! They are really good!
5
Nice ambiance! Great food with reasonable price, given that the restaurant is located in the middle of CBD area. Highly recommend to order their Iberico char shu! It melt in your mouth
5
Great food at super good prices! Service was excellent! This will definitely be a regular hang out after work. Must try these:
Salad with miso dip!
Squid with ink batter
Rosti!
5
It was my first time dining there. We had an enjoyable evening. The services and food were good. Will go back again.
4
Food is not bad but service is slightly patchy. Also, we had tempura that came 30 mins after we finished all our courses.
4
It's fine dining with no frills. Food quality was not bad. The service staff were really busy, But when we got their attention, they gave a few recommendations which are helpful.
5
Been here many times as it's near my workplace. Just came on a Tue night and the place is full. Always make reservations if you come on Thur/Fri evenings or if you have more than 2 pax. Always enjoy the raw tuna with raw egg, kani mentai and yakitori. Tuna sashimi this time is v fresh but the oysters in sake seems to lack the sake taste unlike previous times.Expect to spend about $50/pax even if you don't drink; the food is like tapas portion so you tend to order quite abit but overall I have always enjoyed the good food and casual atmosphere. This is a good place to wind down with friends/ colleagues after a hard day of work
4
We enjoyed our time at ShuKuu Izakaya which feels just like an izakaya in Japan (without the smoke). One of the staff had really good knowledge of the sake & gave great recommendations. There's also lots of choices of sake and food that goes well with the drinks. The food was good though it seems a little on the pricer side. The izakaya was packed though it was a Thursday night & at some point, it gets quite noisy so it's a little tough for conversations. I would advice anyone who wants to visit to make reservations first. I liked the deco of the place & the fact that they played Japanese music (instead of korean or other lang music). Overall, we had a good time and would be glad to return again.
4
a little noisy and good portion a little small - on the day that we were there, the aircon was not working well - no wonder it was kind of hot. This place is good for bar snacks but you cannot really stay in there for too long as it becomes like a fish market. The food was a little salty - the marinated octopus that needed fine tuning ; ordered the oden which was okay. the yakitori sticks were alright, tori tama is still the best. May come back again.

Went there with a couple of friends for some solid drinks and food! Second time I've been here so had the same level of high expectations! Didn't disappoint at all! Food was excellent and of wonderful quality. Tori karaage, mentai based dishes strongly recommended! Yakitori excellent but be prepared to wait it out if it's crowded! Good selection of sake which won't burn a hole in your pocket. Service extremely attentive even though it was running a full house! Strongly recommended for a noisy, fun filled evening

Went in for a quick bite during a weekday - The place is always packed compared to its next-door neighbours. Staff are friendly and food is good solid Izakaya fair - Chicken wings were my favourite! My only complaint is that there is no wine available but there is an extensive Sake menu
5
Food there is excellent however they seemed to be short of staff the night we go. But overall experience is great. And value for money.
4
Food was good with nice ambience. This is my third time visiting. Although it's a bit pricy but overall was ok
4
The staff was really friendly, and the food has a wide variety but it took a while for it to get to us. Will visit again! :)
4
I reserved early so was given good seats. The food was great and staff was friendly too. Good for chilling out after work.
4
My colleague and I went there for lunch. The lunch menu was good. The price was reasonable for the portion we have.
4
ShuKuu is great with its lunch sets which is what attracted me to it. The quality of rice is also great.
4
The food is very interesting and of very high quality. The crowd is relaxed and the service very good (they know their food and help you to order). I found the portions too small and eventually one has to spend more than expected. Expect to pay 40-50$ per person for a good meal with a couple of beers.
5
Yummy food and sake. Tell the staff what you like and dislike before asking for recommendation. Food is favourful so it goes well with drinks. Have oden for comfort food after too much drinks. When it gete busy, it might be difficult to get service but the friendly staff makes up for that!

This is not my first time at ShuKuu and the service was usually impeccable except for this round. I was seated at the corner and everytime I raise my hand to catch the attention of the staff, they get me to wait. After 2 to 3 tries, they continue to ignore me and goes off to the other tables to take the orders, I was pissed and went to the counter. They continued to tell me to wait but I raised my voice a little and said that I had been ignored for so many times. In their defence, the service was back to normal thereafter and they continue to deliver good value and good service

Dropped by for a meal here after work a couple of months back. The sake selection was good and the food was on the whole satisfying. Loved the Gyudon dish and the skewers were a good. The sake to go along with the food was good as well. Overal service was a bit slow at times probably due to the place being very busy at the time. Would def come back
5
I really loved the quality and presentation of the food, it was tantalising yet pleasing to the eyes!
5
The gyu don was so yummy! Salad bar was great. Good place for lunch and conversation! Great service! Highly recommend this to jap food lovers :)
4
Delicious food, esp charcoal grill wing and beef tongue. Blowtorched Salmon nigiri is awesome.
The boss-like staff is a little bit awkward as he looked very free and took photos everywhere, while the staff are busy. Service is generally good. It is pricey but worthy.
4
A very nice atmosphere with very nice staff. Friendly with smiles. Food has variety and so are their range of sake n shochu
4
With three sake to try by the glass or carafe each day, it's a fine way to find the sake for your taste!
4
Simply love the traditional japanese decor! Definitely a great place for after-work chillout and group outings. Food is delicious, especially the vinegared mackerel, beef tendon stew and mentaiko rosti. Good location too -- just a short 5 -10 mins walk from tanjong pagar mrt.

Nice casual place where friends can camp out with a bottle of sake and lots of tapas type izakaya bites. Sake selection is not bad but if u are looking for premium sake, this is not it. But medium range sake aplenty. But they do have the eau du desire or name is desire sake. Yum. Food wise, pretty good. We enjoyed the mental rosti, deep fried shrimps, the 7 skewers kushiyaki which includes tontoro, grilled squid. We loved the slow cooked pork jowl and roasted Camembert cheese with cookies most. The sweetness of the pork Jowl which is well cooked to tenderness, achieving melts in the mouth effect balanced against the subtlety of running yolk. And the Camembert...just yum! Service however was kinda slow. We struggled to get attention only to be asked to wait several times just to order...and to order sake, we gotta wait for the bosses to be available. Well, kinda felt better when Mario came. If they can train the staff to deliver better and more consistent service throughout the restaurant. Think they will get 5 stars from me and become awesome! Staff r not rude but just not attentive.

We ordered a bottle of Junmai daiginjyo, and it was oxidized and dry beyond palatable. However, when we told the manager, he flat out refused to exchange it. Overall experience was bad, an overpriced place, that charges premium restaurant prices but in a casual environment. The food was bland and needed heavy dosing of soy sauce
5
Been there for a catch up with the gang and surprisedly was an awesome place.Price were reasonable and the food really delicious. I can felt the passion of the Chef artwork.The place was quite congested during lunch and dinner time, suggest may go during off peak so you may enjoy the masterpieces from Chef
4
A party of 4 had lunch there and we ordered the katsudon thingy, the gyudon and negitoro don. All were yummy and great for the kind of price we are paying. The "salad buffet is a bit weird but the quality is good. The environment is pretty chill so wouldn't mind coming again for lunch or dinner
4
Very good service. Good skewers, esp pork collar, was music. Can skip the chef selection and try other stuff.
Can we have some more beers please.
5
Awesome food with wide range of sake. The owner was friendly and helpful too. Will definitely be back!
5
it was a good place for gals to catch up over good food & sakes / beers and we felt comfortable in the environment :)
4
I come here for lunch petty often, and their Negitoro is really really good. Pls try. Other than that, their white curry (w cutlet) is milky and tasty too.

I was working at CBD area and decided to try this place after work. It was a short walk from raffles place towards telok Ayer.First impression of the place was that it felt like a typical hang out place in Japan. The atmosphere was lively and relaxing. Customers were having tapas over cups of sake, laughing at jokes and unwinding after work.The food tends to have stronger taste, with generous application of salt and oil, to give a rich taste. This complements with the sake which is fuller and drier.Recommend for people who wishes to chill out after work, and for friends to meet up and try something different
5
Wonderful service & quality jap food at affordable rate. Good assessibility at stanley road cbd area near Telok Ayer Mrt. Also a good chillout place for a drink after work. Ambience is nice with both traditional & contemporary jap decoratives. Crispy shrimps, mentaiko rosti, grilled skewers paired with sake from their recommendations is great. Learnt a lot on how sakes & diff food is paired while the waiters passionately explained upon our call. Good place for a proper full meal or chillout. Gona share the love & bring my friends/families there

Hidden at CBD area for authentic izakaya. Accessible via Telok Ayer Mrt at Stanley St. Stepping in the eatery, you would feel like you are transported to Japan. The servers and owners are quick to make recommendation on food and sake pairing. We choose a house select sake on recommendation and had appetizers , grilled skewers together with sake. The crispy cherry shrimps give a crunchy feel and very fresh. Mentaiko rosti is a good fusion of japanese and european. Food is interesting in general and out of norm. The udon soup is definitely different from other Japanese eatery but its surprisingly tasty and flavourful. Definitely recommend Shukuu Izakaya for dinner and drinks if you are at Raffles Place or Telok Ayer area

You would frequent a Izakaya - Japanese bar for chill or colleagues bonding. This izakaya have nice lunch time sets which you can accompany with sake as well. The place was crowded. My friend made a reservation. I had the izakaya set which comes with pickles, rice and soup with 5 skewer sticks. Very substantial! I believe the night atmosphere would be different and I will return for their highballs. However I am very glad of Singapore's ban on smoking in restaurants.

Went there for a birthday celebration with 5 of my friends for dinner on a Tuesday. place was packed to the brim but luckily, we made reservations. We had a total of 13 different dishes and none of them disappointed! Most noteworthy mentioned was the Tsukune!!!!!!!!! U can taste the chicken cartilage within the minced chicken balls!! Wat a delight!! The minced pork cutlet was another winner for us! The minced pork was well marinated and the cutlet was crispy n tasty. This place is recommended for large group gatherings as there's too many yummy dishes to savour! Will definitely return again!!!!!!!!!!! Keep up the fantastic work!

Packed on the wednesday night that i was there. The place is lively and has an energy about it. Seems like they import a lot of ingredients and sake directly from Japan. Had the grilled skewers, chicken karaage, tuna tartare and amongst other dishes. No frills set up that tries to emulate a little bit of Japanese experience. They have a wide range of sake for those of you who love it. Beers are pretty cheap too! Its a perfect place for post work drinks and food with your colleagues
