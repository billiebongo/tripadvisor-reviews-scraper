It's our first time to eat Home-cooked Taiwanese Food. I don't know if it is authentic Taiwanese dishes, but who cares? We're hungry already. Not so bad at all.
Place is nice. Staff is friendly.

It was past 8pm. We were rushing to pick one that looked remotely able to dish out the food timely to meet our 9pm+ movie at the cinema upstairs.We were debating if we should go for fast food, but the missus was craving for something cooked and Chinese.The food was dished out slow, but about the right time for cook-to-order Chinese style.But.....But........I can tell you one thing for sure - If I am being charged this prices again for those dishes, unless someone I know insist on having a meal there, I would bring them to the one opposite them.a) I tasted the sweetest Chaipo Omelet in my life. Definitely not Chaipo. For sure. Chaipo is not sweet. Tho the portion is about right...b) Meat dumpling (狮子头) - the gravy was steaming hot. So hot they burnt our lips. But the magic was in the dumpling - It's cold to the core.c) San Bei Chicken (三杯鸡) - lukewarm. And do allow me to explain why it's called San Bei (3 cups), because, the making of it requires 1 cup of rice wine, 1 cup of soy sauce, 1 cup of sesame oil. 1:1:1 portion. No taste of rice wine at all....maybe the cook drank it. ha....I'm not being picky, otherwise I'd have picked on every dish I ordered. But I was sold Taiwanese cuisine. They were not Taiwanese cuisine... I've been to Taiwan.I'm sorry.They looked good though. Really
