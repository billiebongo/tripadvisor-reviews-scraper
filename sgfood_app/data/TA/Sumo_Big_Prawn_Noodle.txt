After seeing photos of the noodles posted by friends on social media, we finally decided to head down to AMK to check out this place.It was pretty easy to find the stall - it was located in the Block 628 hawker centre. Just remember to look out for the queue! The stall is located at the end of the row.When we reached at around 6pm+, the lobster noodle has already sold out (or maybe they just didn't have it that day) so we just went ahead to try the big prawn noodles. It costs S$8 per bowl; Although it's a little pricey for prawn noodles, the portion is really quite huge. There wasn't much customization - unlike other stalls where you can choose if you want the dry or soup version - as the only thing you can choose is between vermicelli or yellow noodles. That's a good thing though! The food was prepared very quickly. The soup was pretty tasty and it has generous portions of ingredients - prawns and clams. Surprisingly, the clams were the one that stole the limelight of the dish imo. The clams were very fresh and very meaty! At first, we thought we might still be hungry after that but it was actually quite filling!The only downside was that we felt that there is quite a bit of MSG in the dish. Nevertheless, a bit of MSG is always present here and there in hawker food so no complaints here, just an observation.Overall, it was still pretty yummy and decent

It's located at one hawker near Yio Chu Kang MRT. You can take bus too from AMK MRT. The taste of this prawn noodle is very fresh, quite light but still deliver great taste. The prawn noodle soup cost S$8 which is very worth it! The prawn very big and fresh and they add some mussels. The most popular menu is their lobster noodle anyway. Worth to try for all foodies out there
