We went here with lot of recommendations. They did not have too many vegetarian options. Whatever was there was good though.
Service was okay.

We ate here twice while visiting Singapore. I was familiar with the restaurant from previous visits to south east Asia and I wanted my family to try it. We were not disappointed. The dumplings were excellent of course but, their original wantons in black vinegar and chilli were the star of the meal for us. Their steamed buns were perfection and the noodle and veggie dishes were also to be recommended. We will return again. Excellent, efficient, and friendly service make this place shine just as much as the food. You won’t be disappointed

Visited on a wednesday evening.Luckily we went early at 530pm because after 6pm it became very crowded and there was a queue outside.Not many service people so they seemed always very busy serving customers and taking orders.Most were foreigners serving so they had some difficulty in understanding english.The food was slightly salty but tasty.The famous xiao long bao wasnt up to the original standard of Taipei`s Din Tai Fung.The skin was thicker and there wasnt much liquid inside.Prices were reasonable though

You have to try (a must) Xiao Long Bao (xlb) pork buns (their speciality) and pork and shrimp dumplings are delicious. After paying a dollar for a glass of tea the rest is free flow. Expect a que going late but still in 15 minutes you will in sitting. But the good part is, they give you a list to choose while waiting, ask for a menu to see the food. Enjo

Located in Parkway Parade, it is one of the many eating places of various cuisines and Nationalities.We happened to visit it during lunch time on a holiday.It is a time when generally there is a waiting time of about 15 - 45 minuets depending on the time you reach there. While you are in the "Q" you are asked to fill up order, from a printed order form having each and every item on the offer.Your filled order form is accepted and you are told your number in the "Q" for a table inside . Items on your order are being made ready when you are still waiting for the table as items on your order.are being made ready when you are still waiting for the table.A smart way to provide efficient service and quick turnover during rush hour :-) Decor is business like . Service super efficient.We had ordered Starters , Chicken Rice ,two types of soups . One was Chicken soup unfortunately I can not remember the name of other soup , bot it wad boiled rice noodles as an ingredients and of course steamed chicken dumplings .Starters & Chicken Rice good,Soups were average but steamed chicken dumplings were really vervgood . Highly recommended

This restaurant always have a queue. The wait time can take up to an hour during peak hours. You will be given a number and a menu with pencil to mark down your orders. Food here is good and consistent. Service needs more attention. Décor is ok

I just returned from a business trip to Taipei and had visited the Din Tai Fung Xinyi. Naturally, i compared the Singapore branch with its Taipei counterpart and found the following significant difference.1. The xiao long bao at Din Tai Fung Xinyi is slightly tastier.2. The drunken chicken at Din Tai Fung Singapore is much better as the meat is more refined and tender. 3. However the main difference is the standard of service. Taipei Din Tai Fung is superb and makes one feel welcomed despite being more crowded. Not only are the Taipei staff more polite and attentive, they take the initiative to make certain you have an enjoyable meal. Whereas in Singapore, the service gives one the impression of routine and coldness.4. In Taipei there would be a pot of tea on each table and the staff would offer to pour the tea but here I had to get the attention of the staff to get tea

We eat at DTF at least once a month since the DTF in i12 closed. DTF had been on of our favourites. Last time we visited we had that moment of realisation when we looked at each other wondered what we had been so enthusiastic about. This time I had to review it bluntly in the hope someone arrests the decline. The spicy wantons are OK. The fried rice is way too salty. The xiao long bao aren't even tasty like at a good DTF. The whole thing is just lacking anything to bite into. It's barely more exciting than a school canteen anymore. It's edible and OK for lunch or a grey solo meal rushing over from the Roxy on a business trip. But it's not OK for a date. It's not OK for thrills and it's not OK for a gourmand. Bland bland bland.This place has nothing on Paradise Dynasty. If you want food you can taste, nip down to One KM. Sorry dtf. Lift your game or get a restaurant big enough to give the food the right amount of love

Din Tai Fung is a great place to grab Chinese food, especially their Xiao Long Bao and the deep fried pork plate (Apologies, have forgotten the name). Aside from the usual crowd during meal times, Din Tai Fung also offers a variety of flavours in the Xiao Long Bao which you may try for a different taste.The restaurant is on the expensive side, the portion is acceptable however for those that have a larger appetite might need to order more.Great service by the staff, who helped explain the types of items on the menu and constantly checked back with us for our items and needs

Always an enjoyable experience. Service is fast and efficient although not always especially friendly. Put that aside. You can chose your dumplings or meals at your table or whilst waiting for a table. Your order is taken and the dishes appear quite quickly. A. Ice touch is the small "basket"provided to keep your bags off the floor. Helps them to stay clean and prevents a trip hazard. All the dumpling dishes we ordered were very good, with distinctive flavours. Recommende

din Tai Fung is a very famous chain of restaurants. The food is good. Staff we trained and attentive. It gets pretty full at peak time. you might need to line up to wait.
5
The food at Din Tai Fung is awesome. It is worth the wait for 30 minutes at times. We love the spicy noodles, vegetarian dimsums, mango pudding (must recommended). even the drunken chicken was awesome. Must visit with kids and families

What a great place. You start by looking at the lovely workers make the dumplings through a window and it makes you feel like you are watching a surgery.. Clean and super tasty - with branches everywhere, don't miss it while in SG.

Choice restaurant with a grand menu . Good week end selection for a family outing. Excellent service and food.

XLB is on everyone's table but my favourite has always been the fried rice with pork chop ($12.80). Think of rice coated with egg plus a huge slab of tender pork chop. Have not visited DTF for a while and prices have since gone up. If I recall correctly, it used to be $10.80. We also ordered hot and sour soup. It came warm not hot which I prefer my soup to be. The shrimp and chicken dumplings with spicy sauce and XLB were good but not extraordinary. Our meal came up to $45 thereabout after taxes

We stopped for lunch with the family. We enjoyed the sautÃ©ed bean shoots, dry noodles with special sauce, crab dumplings, pork wontons with black vinegar chili sauce, the fresh cucumbers appetizer, and the classic dumpling (xiao long bao). We had to return the day before we left Singapore because my daughter enjoyed it so much. The parents were happy to oblige.

A little disappointed. Maybe it was the anticipation and my no meat habit but - good but not great. This is about the 10th time we've tried to get in and the first time we have not been defeated.Dumplings we're good and my meat eating friends loved it.Next time I'm there I'll try again ... this is just my opinion.Service was pleasant but slow

Haven't been to Din Tai Fung for quite awhile now. It used to be our haunt as our youngest girl loved the crispy prawn cake here which no other restaurants offer. And we hadn't been back since the restaurant at Katong 112 had closed down and taken over by Tim Ho Wan which we feel were not standard meal offerings to fill our stomachs. And my eldest especially didn't like their small dishes. It was great to see that most of the crew at 112 had transferred over to this branch as we saw the familiar faces that we used to see almost on a fortnightly basis. Food standards have not changed as they kept to their quality. And service is still as prompt as ever even when the queue was really long during peak dinner hours. Ambience, however, is still not as exclusive as Katong 112 which we liked the most of all their branches. Sure wished they had stayed on...All being said, we still recommend this branch as the quality of service that we get from this crew which we are familiar with is still top notch.

This is also a lot of crowd. Also the making of the Xiao long boa can be from the transparent kitchen. There are three making the Xiao long boa - one making the skin, one putting the ingredient on the skin and one closing the skin. A smooth process of making the boa.Ordered garlic meat, Xiao long boa, garlic vegetables and red oil noodle. Standard is the same as other outlets. Overall favor and taste are good. Service for this outlet was fast may due to the outlet is smaller than others

The Xiao Long Bao was what made Din Tai Fung famous, but the quality and consistency seems to have suffered across the branches over the years. The skin was rough and thick, and the Shrimp and Pork Siew Mai and Dumplings seem to use the same skin and tasted bland. The only decent item we had was the pork bun. For good dim sum next time I would just walk across to the Neptune Dim Sum at Marine Parade Food Centre
