One of my favourite places in Singapore to eat Curry Chicken noodles (speaking as a local who has tried Curry Chicken Noodles all over the island). Love the place - good food, low prices and quick service.

Our party of 6 came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. As we were early, there were quite a few empty tables and we were quickly settled down to look at the menu. We ordered a steak chicken, chicken macaroni, bean sprouts and fried prawn paste pork belly, and of course chicken rice.The chicken was very nicely done, and the chicken rice fragrant. The fried pork belly was nice too but the portion was small for the price we paid. The bean sprouts was ok but the macaroni was nothing spectacular. As we were leaving, we noted that the tables were now all taken.

Food was fantastic! Went there with a Friend and we had a blast.Yummy chicken rice. Quick service. And clean nice place. It will be so busy during the lunch time and dinner. So take your meal time a bit late , so it won't be so busy. Then you can enjoy your food well. Otherwise you need to make a line to wait for having a sit Looking forward to visiting again

Came here today for lunch and opted for one of the chicken rice sets including a side of bean sprouts and supplemented with a cold barley water. Very busy at lunchtime but we were able to get a table without a wait. Food was decent and service was efficient. Worth visiting again

Singapore the most affordable chicken rice you can find here. It just few jumps from Bugis MRT station, just next to it. Yuumm chicken rice. Quick service. And clean nice place. It will be so busy during the lunch time and dinner. So take your meal time a bit late , so it won't be so busy. Then you can enjoy your dood well. Otherwise you need to make a line to wait for having a sit. :

Feeling very tired and sick, been wanting to have porridge and saw this place nearby where I lived. Ordered based on what was advertised on their menu board above. Got charged a couple of dollars more than what was "advertised" and when I queried in English, the waiter just bluntly answered in Mandarin and with my limited ability in that language, understood something along the lines of "those are old prices". SO, in other words, you're still using a misleading menu board because........?? If your restaurant signboard reads "Chuen Chuen since 1979", surely you'd have some revenues earned from the last 36 years to replace it if not, at the very least remove it?! Surprised Singapore, the fine city, allows false advertising by businesses. So not impressed and will never return. Food wasn't horrible but, attitude and dishonesty is! Just, simply not worth it

This is my second review and come to this restaurant again on March,17. This is my second time tried fish head curry and I recommend to my overseas colleagues and came together for business dinner. They share that the curry flavour taste great and i feel the fish head curry is suitable for 4-people.At bugis, this restaurant serve food fish head curry and chicken rice and worth trying if you are keen to try singapore foodEnjoy

The bugis branch is beside my office and came here with colleagues during lunch time. Been a year since I come back, this time I came back because I heard the change of staff and become for friendly to customer. Indeed the management did some reshuffle and I can see clear improvement of crowd. Order Chicken Rice set C and it taste great. Now it seem back to the old time where lunch time is very crowded. I notice today around 1210pm, the queue get longer to cater to working adult. Order Set C Chicken Rice set. Cost $4.50
