When you are in marina bay sands you expect so much more. The food court is just ok with staff that has language difficulties and unexplained menus . Quite a nightmare for vegitarians
1
Meals were cheap, but so was the quality. We were looking for a quick meal which is why we went there. Mostly pre-cooked meals served luke-warm, drinks served room temperature. Flavours in the food were strangely non existent.
3
We were out and about touring around and ended up here purely by accident. Ate chicken rice and ramen. Decent food, affordable prices. Wouldn’t make a special trip but if you are here it’s a decent choice.
4
Busy and hard to find a table but the Indian food (can’t remember the name of the stall) I had was worth waiting round for. Reasonable price (for Singapore) and very tasty. Freshly made/baked naans and helpful staff. Veggie options are also good here.
4
Came here for lunch yesterday (20/2) with my local friend - we had Hainese Chicken rice plus tofu and vegetables from the Tong Fong Fatt stall - very nice indeed - the rice was flavoured by cooking in chicken stock - we had three sauces - chilli, ginger and dark soy sauce.We also had desserts - my friend enjoyed the mango and I had the Durian iced dished - both good.Raspura Masters is located near the skating rink and has around fifteen or more stalls.Prices are reasonable - recommende
2
Rasapura had a lot of expectations from our side, but sadly it didn't live up to them. The food was decent however the Indian food center was terribly overpriced and the food too tasted pathetic. I, however enjoyed the ti pau and the other chinese food. I also ordered japanese food for Kurao-obi Ramen. This place doesn't have much variety for vegetarians
4
Lots of different food stall all under the same area at the end of the Marina Bay Sands complex.We found a Chinese food place that had sweet and sour pork and oyster beef and steamed Asian greens that had a depth of flavour that was amazing for a food court outlet, really good.$9 a plate was cheaper that a coffee at High Society which is 50m away
1
Worst Indian food ever! Naan was half baked, Dal had no flavors as it was atleast a day old, rice was cooked with excess baking soda to save cooking time and quality of rice was pathetic/ cheap, aalo palak had no palak at all. Being an Indian and an ex Hotelier I could sense that he is fooling tourists and non Indians and making profits. He obviously doesn't have any repeat customers... Some of you might get overwhelmed with sea food and. Beef smell at Rasapura food court. The only vegetarian option (besides this Indian food) we could find was Pasta and Pizza but I had hard time explaining the order taker not yo add any nonveg toppings! Worst Indian food ever!

Located at B2 of MBS, expecting to charge a higher price than usual. However, do prepare some food could have a premium as higher as 100%Neverthless, they have most of the local food to try, unless you willing to travel out of the building, this is probably the cheapest choic
4
For the last two weeks while making Asias Got Talent in the Theatre this became our canteen. The food is very good value by Sing standards although I would still recommend a visit to an authentic hawker location. Most of the food is great, the Indian as mentioned in other reviews is good. I really like the Thai beef and basil and most of the food on offer looked delicious. I was not impressed with the chicken rice. Normally you canâ€™t go wrong in Singapore with chicken rice, I did here, twice. Cold and bloodied and served by grumpy your men, really awful.Apart from that this is a great place to eat a value meal at MBS which other wise is over priced
3
This is a good spot to come any time of day. There is lots of choice and everything is well priced. But it is a food court, so don't expect a luxury dining experience.
3
Not bad for food court dining but not outstanding either.
Fried items had clearly been sitting for a while. Steamed dumplings were slightly better, but still couldn't get to any better than average.
4
It's really a shock for the senses when visiting Rasapura - so much deliciousness and so many people. If crowds bother you then I wouldn't try here, but if you are willing to try then go for it!
4
we ate here 2 lunches in a row because the strategic location and so many options to choose. despite being a food court the food offered here were actually good and tasteful. seats might probably be difficult to find during busy lunch and dinner hours, but I never saw people standing too long to be seated, just wait 1-2 mins and seats would be available. when we were there in August 2017, the ice skating rink was being renovated
5
Relative to the many other restaurants in Marina Bay Sands, the food court serves cheaper alternatives. But note that the prices are more expensive, compared to the other food courts in Singapore. Yong tau foo 6 pieces plus noodle is $7.70. I tried Ajisen (abit too oily) and Bak Kut Teh. The latter is spicy pepper-based pork broth served with spare ribs, one of the signature local dishes
5
Came here for an affordable meal (rare in Singapore!) and boy were we impressed! The Indian stall on the left as you enter the food court offered a huge serving, very tasty butter chicken and amazing naan cooked to order! Some of the best indian food I've had
4
we landed up here after visiting singapore flyer, crosssing over helix bridge and visiting the science museum. on going down from escalator we saw several eateries, and front one there was an Indian one. we went there for the set meal and curries were ok, but Nan was awesome - huge, hot and tasty bread. cost wise also pretty cheap - kids had a filling nice meal. then the adults of us headed to the casino on the upper floor.
3
I went to this food court after visitting Art Science Museum at Marina Bay Mall.I order Hokkien Mee, but I forgot the name of the stall.The presentation is ok, they put mee in somekind of bamboo platform. But the taste is quite tasteless, nothing special.You can see my travel picture at my Instagram : @adjimantor
4
We are looking for halal food. Luckily, we found this food court called Rasapura Master. It is a busy place and crowded. I'm happy that we found a halal food. The stall name is Nasi Padang. They served Malaysian Nasi Padang version. Their service is fast. Very clean. You can take MRT or Taxi.
4
I was hungry and smelt the Indian food from this stand and just had to have a skewer of lamb seekh kebab. I watched as the skewers were loaded into the tondoor and waited in anticipation. The dipping sauce was very tasty and the depth of spices in the flavouring of the meat were very complex and subtle. My only downside was the noisy atmosphere and lack of comfortable chairs, the food was great though
4
Get your seat secured first since there are so many people. I had hokkien mee and it was very delicious.
1
A waste of money and time. It's not good. Chicken Teriyaki ? Soooo insipid. Pork chop ? Sooo savorless. There's a lot of restaurants here, don't choose this one.
3
All kind of rather cheap Asian food in this food court in a mall and area dominated by quite expensive restaurants.
1
Not sure why there's a duplicate listing for this overrated food court. but giving it the same rating.
3
You not short of choices here loads of food to choose from. Usually order the fried meatballs with noodles never have been disappointed with it.
3
The food here is passable but in a city with such a rich gastronomic background, it's base ethnic roots were somewhat lost giving a "western food court trying to be Asian feel". The range is decent as is the food but it is nothing special and there are certainly more authentic, flavoursome and cheaper options around.
3
they have a variety of food from korean, malay, thai, indian and many others.Situated at the main food court of the marina shoppee -tried their indian food - tikka, boti and dum biryani -food was pretty alright, nothing great to write back home but a good option when you are visiting the marina bay sands hotel / sky park or surrounding area
2
I wasn't impressed with Rasapura Masters. Especially after visiting food centers in Thailand. The food quality is poor and very repetitive between vendors. The prices are good, and there's plenty of seating. It's in a HUGE mall, so depending which entrance you come in from, it's a very long walk
4
If you looking for a good & comfortable place to eat with air con and many choices of food then this is the right one. After long walk in Garden By The Bay, it really nice to seat there and enjoy a good meal, eventhough it quite pricey but it worth for a very good food taste.
5
I've been here many times and often take foreign visitors here too, especially if we've just been to the ArtScience Museum next door. There's so much choice, and most things really good. The concept of a luxury food court does seem a bit of an oxymoron but so is Singapore sometimes, yet it seems to work well
2
This is the only Indian restaurant in the entire food court. Lousy options hardly any for vegetarians. Very pricey for the quality and taste. Wouldn't ever recommend.
4
We had the bak kut teh followed by sweets at the TWG shop afterwards. We really liked both of it - especially the bak kut teh. We were here on a Sunday and didn't have any issue finding places to sit and enjoy our meal.
3
Food quality is average for Indian food. We had a chana masala and Naan. They don't keep the Naan prepared but do it in front of you once you order. Price wise it is expensive but there is no other option here.
2
Food court with a wide variety of different foods on offer. Very busy and very noisy which would be okay if the food served was of a better quality than it actually is.
1
Food was overcooked and kept warm for hours, No taste at all. Very noisy and shouting bad english speaking staff. Avoid this place. There are so many other food courts in the area
4
A great range of cheap asian style eats of different varieties and styles. All of it seems very fresh and is delivered fast.
3
The food here was surprisingly nice but obviously lacked the atmosphere of the real hawker markets. It's a quick, relatively cheap (compared to other places in Marina Bay Sands) place to eat. Not a whole lot of variety but enough to find something for everyone's tastes.
4
These are the same food stalls from other food courts in Singapore.At this premium location in Marina Sands Bay, you would expect prices to be ramped up, But it hasn't.Food quality is not anything to brag about but at least the portions are normal and not shrunkened.Clean and busy, could be tricky to find a table. Cleaners are pretty effective
1
This review relates to the Nasi Padang food outlet only.The food served is COLD! The lady at the counter was on her mobile phone and disinterested in customers. Did not offer options for warming the food. Pricing for each item is misleading.I strongly recommend customers to avoid this food outlet
4
Very good food court within the mall. Almost every style of cuisine you could want--some cooked food, even, so no waiting around. If you do wait, most locations give you a buzzer to collect your food when it's ready. it is crowded, so finding a table could be a challenge. Pricing is varied--not as cheap as most hawker centers, but for the location, very affordable
5
Food court in the basement area of the Shoppes (Mall). A kind of Asian food. I highly recommend the freshly made stir-fries in a pan and dont forget to get a fresh fruit juice (ask for not adding any sugar to the juice!)
5
Even though in the Marina Bay Sand Complex very affordable. Wide selection mainly Asian as expected but some western dishes available too
3
This is an overpriced foodcourt. The food here tasted average and totally not worth the price. There are much better food court in Singapore...
4
They offer a variety of traditional food that you can choose from. My food was from one of the shop (which I can't recall the name) that they allow the customers to customize their dish. Not so service oriendted but very delicious indeed.
4
On the positive side the food area in the mall had a good selection of eastern foods. The laksa we chose was very tasty and reasonably priced. As it should be.On the negative side the place was overcrowded and noisy. It took 5 mins from getting food to find somewhere to sit.As mall food courts go this is a good one
4
Once you have found a place to seat, you have many choices for all tastes. It's not expensive compare to the restaurants of the mall. We have tested the indian food at the entrance, big plate with nan, rice and different kinds of sauces. It was a good choice
3
In two minds whether to recommend this pricey food court. The food is good and its local with many different Asian styles. If you want to get the character of the open air food markets so popular in Singapore, this is a good place to come, as it is air conditioned (there is an ice skating rink!) and the food quality and variety is good.But there is a price to pay... literally... compared to the traditional open air sit down restaurants that are TRULY a 'real' experience. This is way more expensive which of course is to be expected in the Marina Bay Sands.If you are tired and hot and want to sit down in comfort, then come here. If you want the real Singapore food experience then you need to get our on the streets where you will experience something far more real, but far cheaper
4
As this is a food court in Marina Bay Sands, the price of the food sold here is very affordable (of course, you cannot and should not compare the price here with the hawker stalls in the residential area). There's also a wide variety of food. The only complaint is that there is very limited seating space available and you can see people constantly standing next to tables where the occupants are about the finish their food
1
A miscommunication re doubling the order on one plate ( I waited for the second plate) caused the kitchen staff at the Huat chicken wing counter to feel the need to start yelling at me. I had no idea two orders were on the one plate which my daughter had already taken. I also had no idea what she was yelling. With customer service skills like this these staff give rasapura a bad name. There was no communication. No one knew whose order was whose as it was. AVOI
2
Because we were staying in MBS hotel and we were with an elderly person, we have opted to eat most meals here. Knowing how good most of the hawker food in Singapore are combined with reasonable prices, this food court merit an honest evaluation from the food industry people. I can understand the higher cost that the stalls charge for the food but it shouldn't be asking too much if they serve good quality food as well. Because we were many, we managed to taste most food on offer. The only stall that's worth the praise was that selling Singapore noodles and carrot cake. The rest should be ashamed of the lack of quality of food that they serve. So yes, go elsewhere
2
The juice was so watered down, it may have been water. Lucky I got the one with extra pieces of juice, otherwise it would have been a very bad experience.
3
Did not meet my expectation of a fine foodcourt, esp one that is in downtown area. ION food court is much, much better than this one.
4
A friend & I tried several different dishes and everything was delicious! Food was freshly prepared and authentic. Must admit, it was difficult to choose among all the restaurants at the Marina Bay mall - they were all so tempting...
5
After getting in to Singapore late, I was looking for an easy find for breakfast food, but something somewhat traditional. This was a great choice, with really friendly service. Get the Kaya Toast Set!
5
diffrent kind of food indian , thai, chinese , malay , sea food, really cheap and good place to sit and eat but they only take cash so bring the cash when going there
3
The food court has a good variety of local food but it is very pricey compared to food courts in other malls. Even though it is supposed to be open for 24 hours, in reality most of the stalls are closed by 10pm and only a handful remain open in the wee hours. It can get warm and stuffy there in the wee hours as they turn off the airconditioning. It gets very crowded during lunch and dinner and it can be hard to secure a seat
1
There is nothing much to shout about dining at Rasapura Masters in MBS. For most of the food sold over here, you can get it elsewhere which not only taste better, but also selling at a fraction of the price sold in Rasapura Masters. In fact, the food sold here is so pricey, the price for a serving of chicken rice sold here can get you a decent set meal at restaurants in other areas. Also, the food selection is rather boring. Take your money elsewhere for better selections
4
A great range of tasty dishes await you here whether it be for breakfast, lunch, dinner or snack. You can eat well here for less than SGD$15.Highly recommended. There is a really good Chinese beef noodle soup vendor right in back corner - only SGD$6 for a bowl of beef noodle soup - super yummy.Indian food and Chinese dumplings, bao (buns) etc all very tasty
3
This is the cheap alternative for a quick meal at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, so don't expect too much. It has a lot of options and for the most part, it's pretty decent. Not as fun as going to the hawker malls but certainly a lot cleaner and more comfortable. The prices are reasonable, but as I mentioned, don't expect a great meal. Tastes good enough to fill your stomach so you don't walk away thinking you wasted your money
1
Didnt like the place , many shouting at you trying to sell you their food . I asked if a dish is spicy the lady asked what i want spicy or not ? i said not spicy she answered not spicy ...the food was spicy ... ion the juices session i asked if they have coonut juice , the lady said yes and gave me coconut water ...when i want to return and ask for banana juice which by the way was 3 dollars instead of 4.5 she siad they have only the big one which is ...4.5 usd !!! dim sums werent too tasty either...lotss of noisy and feel like a market with people trying to sell you whatever they wan
4
So much authentic South East Asian food on offer at this indoor hawker style food court eatery. Difficult to decide with so many interesting options, prepared to order. Only wished we had more time to try more...
5
Located in the Shoppes at Marina Bay, Rasapura Masters is a great collection of different varieties Asian food.
3
Some cuisines are quite good but the price tag is atrocious. Not very friendly staff but are ESPECIALLY friendly to tourists and TOTALLY forgetting the locals.
4
There was lots of variety of food options (though primarily Asian cuisine). It was essentially an upmarket food court / hawker centre. Clean, quick service. Food was good. Great place to get a bite to eat that won't send you broke in an otherwise expensive shopping centre
3
Tourists would marvel at the diversity of food on offer. Locals will find the quality average to below average, and prices much higher than at other 'premium' food courts in town, because of the high rent charged here. They converge at Rasapura because a meal here is still cheaper than at restaurants at MBS, except at the other food court called "1983 - A Taste of Nanyang" which is less diverse and no better nor better value
3
Three of us had not much time that day and spent the 'asian' breakfast here. We had 3 dishes plus desserts and were happy with what being served. To me the taste is okay (not better than other food courts or hawker stalls) but the price is a bit higher.Plus points for climated and cleaner/tidier place
3
Was at the area for a conference and decided to eat at this food court located at Marina Bay Shoppes. Large variety of stalls but at a definitely higher price as compared to other food courts. A bowl of yong tau foo (6 pieces) will set you back by $7.70, one popiah at $3.00, rojak at $6.00, rice with three veg at $6.00 etc. In the end, I had the Pepper lunch express of curry hamburg steak at $10.80 which seems reasonable. Plenty of seats are available. There are definitely cheaper options elsewhere but if you are in this area and do not want to venture too far out, this is the place to go to
4
At Marina Bay Sands there is a casino where top players bet tens of thousands a chip and downstairs there are luxury brand shops where they spend thousands of dollars on buying just one handbag.But if you are not in that class, and I certainly am not, you can still eat here, and it is some of the most delicious food you will find in Singapore.The food court has an astonishing array of cuisine, including Malay, Indonesian, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, many other regional cuisines, and western food.We chose to go with Malay food, and bought our lunch from Nasi Padang, a stall that offered a choice of rice with two or three helpings of the specials of the day.I chose beef rendang, curried chicken, and braised ladies' fingers (okra).My friend chose similar, and with a beer and a fresh coconut juice the bill was S$25, representing excellent value for money, particularly when I reflected on what someone would be paying upstairs in one of the fine dining restaurants
4
This place is a food court in Marina Bay Shoppes. Several stations serving a variety of food. Most of the cooks may be observed - worth a watch to see pasta made from scratch. The food is acceptable but not special but the prices are much lower than nearly all of the nearby restaurants. Getting a table for dining can be difficult at busy times
4
We were staying at Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the Rasapura Masters was only a short walk away from the hotel where you can have a variety of different meals (a bit like a food court) asian, westernthai etc for a reasonable price compared with the hotels. The meals we had were nice and filling
3
Atmosphere: Really colourful, vibrant in the evening with all visitors of Singapore dining here.
If you can decide quickly, then go and get your choice from one of the food stalls and enjoy dining in this atmosphere.
3
I had a medium portion of Singapore noodles which was $18, which is pricey for a food court. They were quite tasty though. There is good variety in this food court so it is worth a visit.
4
Probably the nearest food court to Marina Bay Sand hotel. 10 minutes walk. Many choices. Open early morning. I was told that some operating even 24 hours.
4
Good food but very very crowded. Difficult to get the chair. The food is delicous. Bak kut teh, korean food, dimsum. All food is very yummy with afordable price
4
We were tired walking all over Marina Bay Sands and getting tired. Our legs were aching and felt the hunger pangs. When we entered Rasapura Masters, we had plenty of choices from different food court. The food court is expensive compared to the other food courts in the different city malls, but one has to pay the price for all the glittering glamorous environments. Anyway, the food was good and satisfying. Loved the ambiance of the place.
4
We visited many hawker centres in the city and this one was basically a more expensive sanitised version. Although it was more expensive it still wasn't expensive in anyway and the portion sizes were huge! It's great because there's lots of different cuisines to chose from and you can try lots of different things in one place
3
We enjoyed lunch here though thought it really odd that the Shoppes would be host to a hawker style food place. It was a treat too.Place was far cleaner than Broadway or City Mall shops. Definitely had a higher standard and seemed to offer an expanded version of food choices.Our crew ate Korean BBQ, Viet bun bo hue, Chicken lahksa and japanese udon w/meatballs.Nice place to rest up after a morning hiking about
4
The Rasapaura Masters food court has many food options and reasonable prices for MBS. The food is more expensive than other food courts in Singapore but to be expected given the location in MBS. I had fragrant hotpot. I enjoyed the meal and would recommend especially if you like spicy food
4
If your are at MBS and feeling hungry, no matter which part of world you are from, all you need to do is visit this place and they serve all cuisines, all you need to take care of grabbing a seat.Vegeterians will have very limited variety thoug
4
This is a very good value restaurant in the food court of the massive shopping centre. We had 2 meals for Â£4 each so hard to beat. We tried a Korean seafood soup served with rice which was very tasty but very hot. There was so much choice I think everyone can find what they like but if you are scared of spicy food, it is best to ask when ordering. Anyway it was very good
3
There are many varian of food here. For me the taste is standard, i choose ajisen ramen when coming here. You better find table first before you order because its very crowded.
4
What a fantastic little find - a hawkers stand in the bottom of a posh shopping centre. The food was great and while not as cheap as some places, rather easy on the wallet.
4
A multitude of options are available. Pretty much any Asian cuisine you can think of. Dim Sum, Indian. Cash only
4
Huge selections and cheap considering located at prestigious Marina Bay Sands.
Recommended for cheap foods in MBS. Good.
4
Too many variety of food to choose from but prices are kinda high. But we can always buy drinks from elsewhere to save a bit.
1
I visited Marina Bay Sands on a weekend with my family to visit the Art Science Museum. We decided to visit Rasaputra Masters as my daughter was hungry. She wanted to eat Duck Rice so we approached the stall to order a standard plate of Duck Rice.I was shocked at the price of the Duck Rice which cost SGD8.00!! What went worse was the portion...It is extremely pathetic and was less that what a local hawker food stall was offering at SGD3.00! If Marina Bay Sands wants to slaughter the China tourists, please go ahead but not at the expense of other nationalities! Not to mention a bowl of noodles going at $10.00 and a cup of coffee at $2.30. The Singapore Government should not allow such inflation in Singapore! This is ridiculous
5
Go there if you want to have a quick lunch. You will find a big variety of asian food there. Quality and taste depends on specific lot. But all are very cheap comparing to the regular restaurants - around 10$ for a set (soup + main). Don't miss the local desert :-
4
Given its location, in an expensive shopping centre filled with designer label stores and linked to Marina Bay Sands Hotel, prices are relatively more expensive in this food court compared to other places. However, it is air conditioned, which is an advantage.We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights and had a few meals here. Enjoyed some dim sum for breakfast and roast chicken rice for lunch
4
So you're (window) shopping at MBS The Shoppes and feeling hungry, but afraid to spend a fortune in any of those posh cafes, lounges, or cuisine restaurants? Just head downstairs to this Rasapura foodcourt and pick your favourite kind of meals at more friendly prices--anything for quick lunch or dinner is available to choose according to your taste preference, from safe&favourite choices such as chicken rice/duck rice/japanese bento with teriyaki/tempura/katsu to more spicy or exotic Asian dishes. Snacks, appetizers or desserts such as fresh sliced fruits, puddings, etc are also available for those opting for lighter meals instead. Just look around the area before making your decision on what to have, just get the free seat beforehand as this foodcourt tends to get cramped and crowded during the busy hours or weekends. As for the service, don't expect anything extraordinary.. all the foodstall staff are busy serving customers that they sometimes forget to smile or being friendly at all.. but it shouldn't be a problem, cause it is usually the same in any other busy/crowded foodcourts.. you just come here for a quick meal anyway, not for long hour, fancy or romantic dinner
1
We went here for a quick supper before a concert and it was dire.The place was very crowded which is to be expected as it was a Saturday and it took a while to find a seat.We ordered Thai food and we were given a disc which rings when your food is ready to collect which is a great idea.The food was overpriced,tasteless,a small portion that bore no resemblance to the picture on the menu and looked as it had been hurled on the plate at speed.This was the second time I have dined here and it had not improved.The UB40 concert was excellent !
3
Had an early dinner here because we don't have much energy to walk further and find a restaurant to have our dinner in. Just enough to satisfy your hunger. Note, I didn't actually explored the entire food court so this is only my impression.
5
This is a food court with wide array of choices across indian, korean. malay, chinese, cantonese and continental food...is open till 10 and is very reasonable on the wallet...and all fresh
4
this massive food court has options of pretty much every asian food style you can imagine (including a few i was not familiar with). fun and tasty enough (it's still basically fast food, after all).
3
My rate to the stalls here are average to good but nothing special. It is just a normal hawker you placed in an expensive mall.
If you have time to explore the nearby places better eat somewhere else.
4
If you are in love with sea food, worth having here. delicious and tempting noodles. You can have indian, Malay dishes also. Vegetarian also have lots of options.
4
All in one eating place. You name a type of food and you gonna find this here at Rasapure. We looked for Indian food, and we got it. Great taste and great price.
2
There is nothing good to eat in MBS! Or nothing reasonably priced and good... Walked the whole length of MBS and didn't find anything of my fancy. The cafe I wanted to go (went before and it was quite nice) but couldn't find it. The same location is now a bank... Suppose it closed down... So I ended up in the food court. Walked around it and noticed everything is about 2-3 times more expensive than normal food courts. EXPENSIVE!Laksa for $8?!! That's madness... Korean food for $12?! That's restaurant price! Not food court. After one round I decided to get the KL Ancient Charcoal noodles. The most "special" dish on the list other than normal chicken rice, fish ball noodles etc. I think the noodles were ready made and just heated. I saw him pouring a ready cooked bowl of noodles into the wok and just adding a dash of dark soy sauce, stir up and serve... Not so authentic!The taste of the noodles was black, bitter and not great. The noodles were more like thick udon noodles than hokkien mee. I've had this in KL before, the one in Rasapura is nothing like it. Even though it's Rasapura "Masters" food court... I wouldn't eat in this food court ever again and I would definitely not recommend it. Bad.
5
Rasapura Masters is the hawker food court in The Shoppes at Marina Bay. It offers a real smorgasbord of Singaporean fare with all types of choices imaginable. I settled for a bowl of Yong Tau Fu, which is tofu in an unimaginable array of different presentations that you have with a selection of noodles in broth and eat as a wet noodle soup. You have the different types of Tau Fu (tofu) displayed and you get a bowl and start making your selections (don't forget some greens too!!) and when done, hand it over to the friendly hawker and tell him which type of noodles you would like (there are five different types...) he then cuts the tofu into more or less bite sized morsels, warms them up with the noodles and the veggies in the hot soup, and when done, he serves you a piping hot bowl of delicious tofu and noodles soup. In the mean time, you will have picked your spoon, chop sticks and served two small sauce dishes - one with a slightly spicy delicious sambal and the other a sweet and savory dipping sauce to dip the tofu while you eat. you then sit at any of the tables and enjoy this great and delicious experience of having Singapore style hawker food
4
This food court in Marina bay Sands mall serves a large variety of food from around the world at a reasonable price. Had vegetarian north Indian food here. A meal for one costs under 10 singapore dollars. you have to walk through the entire mall with a canal runing in the middle which is world class .MRT Station Marina bay front leads you to Garden by the bay and also this mall. A visit to both the places is a must whenever I visit singapore
5
We went here for lunch and we found that there were foods that suited everyone in our group. The only thing I didn't like was that there was not many tables so we had to look around for a few minutes to find a table. Other than this I recommend anyone visiting the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands to eat here.
4
It has good food, as we ate sarawak kolo mee but of course to us we feel the food is really expensive. But in the end the food turned out really worth the price for its flavour
3
There's a wide variety of food in this food court, but there's not a lot of western food choices.
The prices are also not cheap when you compare it to other food courts. Also not the most spectacular taste.
4
This food court in the Marina Bay Sans complex offers favourites from Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Japan, Vietnam and China. Open 24hrs. Food was good!
4
It's had Ben awhile for eating here really really enjoyed my meal... Chicken Rice & Pork Meat Ball Noodles. Yum Yum Yum. Looking forward to my next time already.

All sorts of Asian-Inspired food here. Was a yummy dinner and FAR cheaper than eating at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel!!!
4
This is a good food court with a wide range of food styles.We've been here on previous visits to Singapore and have always had a good meal at a reasonable price.The main problem is that it's popularity makes finding a seat difficult.When in Marina Bay Sands it is an affordable option for good food
3
This food court at Bayfront in the mall is not quite as stylish to look at or tasty as its competitors in Food Opera or Food Republic. There is still plenty of choice and there is ample seating, but the local dishes were not quite up to par. I would recommend 15 min walk to Satay at the Bay, admitted not air conditioned and still tourist orientated, but at least more authentic
4
I'm currently on a Korean food kick so went with that while my friend went Indian. Decent sized portions. It's not the best lunch you'll ever eat but the shoppers and office workers get a fantastic range of good food, served quickly, for around Â£6.Compare that to a UK food court of greasy burgers, chicken and over priced sandwiches and you'll know why I like eating in these types of places so much.Well worth a visit for a quick meal in Marina Bay
4
The Rasapura Masters food court style offers many Asian options of dining. It's casual ambience allows for an inexpensive meal. However the fact that it is based within the Marina Bay Sands complex does make it more expensive than elsewhere. There is a good variety on offer, Indian, Chinese of many regions, Japanese, Korean, etc. something to please most. Budget for $10-20 per head depending on what you order
4
Kind of Upmarket foodcourt. You'll be spoilt for choices here. They have Western and Asian cuisines. If you stay at Marina Bay Sands...then this must be one of your stops. The Indian food is good and you have a variety of choices. The Nasi Padang (mixed choices of dishes), Yong Tau Foo is also good if you want taste asian food . Not forgetting Chicken Rice. But be sure to tell them which part of the chicken you want, and whether steam or roasted chicken. On the whole i can't complain...it is worth the try but you have to go early as peak hours during dinner and you'll find it hard to get a table. The minimum for food in $6 or $6.50..i will be surprised if you can get anything cheaper...but there are numerous stalls and i could be wrong. Bon appetit
3
Food here is considerably ok but the food taste almost ok. Environment was too noisy and it is a long que as they are might be the only cheapest place in Marina.
4
Here you can have a range of good basic Asian foods -- from Korean to Indian favorites -- and some Western cuisine. Everything is good, hot and fresh and is pretty much fairly priced (for the area and building).
5
One of the best food courts I've ever been to. Not too generic, great atmosphere in a beautiful mall adjacent to Marina Bay Sands Hotel/Casino. Different cuisines for different palates.
4
we had just a couple of dishes, along with coffee and beer, after finishing our visit too the museum
The flavours were great. It was self service in the food court, but nice reasonably priced food. Nothing to complain about.
1
There is limited selection for vegetarians. So if ar veg u will b left with pizza or a pasta. There is only one Indian express and there veg combo is out of stock most of the time
4
A really good value place to eat, loads of choice so everyone can be pleased. Great busy atmosphere by the ice rink. You may need to float around the tables to get a seat, best to do this before you get your meal. Don't look for a fully empty table, you will be sharing with others. We took it in turns to go up and buy want we wanted. Jax went bento box, I had You mian which was lovely and spicey. Both S$8 ...Â£4. Didn't see many western faces which we liked.Beer priced S$5.60 can Tiger.Will go back
4
Rasapura Masters, holds a lot of different cuisines from other regions/countries like Japan, Korea, India, Thailand, etc but most have reasonable prices, meals enough to fill you up but not put a huge dent on your budget. It is a good place for a tourist or traveler to get a taste of everything a region offers. You can have Bah Kuh Te, Char Kuey Teow, Yakitori, Chicken rice all at the same time if you want! It was a good place for us tourists to have dinner and pick any food we want and come back to our table to share with our group
4
Everytime I go to Singapore , I've to eat Rasapura. It's a really nice place to eat. Espacially the MIXED RICE at the corner of Rasapura.But food price here is really bad things. I ordered the Mixed Rice with 3types of vegetables and 2types of meats and it cost REALLY EXPENSIVE. But nevermind...I'll go to singapore shortly and I'll try Rasapura again!FOOD SCORE = 8PRICE SCORE = 
4
Singapore is an expensive city to eat in, and sometimes one simply wants to grab something quick, healthy, tasty and cheap. Rasapura Masters offers just that...and with a family of 5 it gave everyone the chance to choose what they wanted to eat, Indian for mum, cantonese for one child, Singapore noodles for another, deep fried dumplings for another and a sampling of several cuisines for Dad ;-) The food was tasty and there was enough choice to keep coming back day after day
1
It's not even a last place one should go here. People here don't understand basic English. While they can't just understand what you asking them, their attitude is worse and on top the food is pathetic. More than money wasted, it was ridiculous behavior which irked me most.
4
There is heaps of different things to choose from here and they are reasonably priced. Good for a family - it is like a food court, so noisy and busy.
3
The surroundings were good but the service was very slow. Also, they won't serve you or provide a bill until you press the appropriate button on a contraption on the table. Coffee was mediocre.
5
I tried indian food at 3 different places in singapore...... indian express is the best one ...... i will always remember their biryani and chicken curry..... everything they served was fresh.... hygenic..... i will recommend this place to all i dian visitors. . Dont waste time in finding good place to eat... just go to indian express counter in rasapura masters.... it is not expensive.... under $sg 20 for 2 pepl
3
We ended up here for a snack and weren't sure how it worked at all the different stands. Finally, we ended up at one that did "rice bowls" with various meats and veg to go with it.The food itself was pretty bland, looked a little tired and was by no means hot, and it's all a little basic - they just slam stuff onto your plate and point at the lone bottle of soy on the counter.On leaving, some of the other stalls seems to be offering much more tempting fare, so maybe we chose badly. Also, it looks like you have to queue separately for drinks, which can make a meal into something of an obstacle course.In its defence, it's cheap (for Singapore) and no doubt an excellent option for people in a hurry
4
They got a variety of food choices that ranged from the local cuisine and fusions of different foreign cuisines. Some food were a bit pricey but was well worth its price tag. I loved the Prawn Mee and the Ho Fan while my kids found the Indian platter that my husband bought delicious
1
The last time I had Black Forest Gateau as bad as this was oddly enough in the Black Forest itself many years ago.However we have a new champion, and this is it. The only BFG in my life that I have left uneaten. It was horrific, and defied description.The smoothies were none too good either.Eat elsewhere
4
I went at lunch time and it was extremely busy. I struggled to find a table as did a lot of others.I ordered Biryiani Chicken from the Indian stall and definitely enjoyed it.Friendly and prompt service. They were doing the best they could with all the hungry hordes.At the end of the day it is a good court to fill up on food, not a restaurant so you can't expect too much. It was clean when I went despite a lot of table turnover.Also tried the Ais Kachang from the sweets stall. Ok, nothing to rave about. The only downside is the prices are too high for the food you get but in the MBS area, it's probably the cheapest
1
On 19th March 2015 at 12:36:14 (according to the Cash Register Receipt), I ordered 2 plates of “Char Siew Rice”, the Cashier asked if I want small plate or big plate. I said 2 big plates. Then I paid what the Cashier told me is the total amount which was $ 31.60. A minute or two later, I got 2 plates of White Plain Rice (just the rice, nothing else) and 2 plates of Char Siew (just the roasted pork, without the rice). After finding a table, I take a look at the Cash Register Receipt and realized that I was cheated or over-charged. According to the receipt, there were 2 plates of “Char Siew Rice” at $ 6.80 each, and 2 plates of “Char Siew” at $ 9.00 each, so the total is $ 31.60. But I got White Plain Rice, and they charged it as “Char Siew Rice”. The “Char Siew Rice” I know is rice with roasted pork on top of it. When they gave me the rice on one plate and the roasted pork on another plate, I thought that’s how they are serving “Char Siew Rice”. So instead of paying just $ 13.60 (6.80 x 2), I end up paying $ 31.60. On the other hand, I feel they charged me $ 6.80 for each plate of rice, the most expensive plate of white plain rice I have ever eaten in a food court
4
The first thing on my mind when I board the JetStar bound for Singapore is this place in the Marina Bay Sand Shopping Centre. In my mind's eye I see a Chinese man making fresh noodles right after you make your order in front of you while you wait. He stretches the dough to arms length and then doubles it into two strands, stretches it and doubles it into four and Into eight and then into 16 and then Ito 32 strands just right for a serve. He throws it into a boiling broth and then stirs it for few minutes until it is cooked to perfection. He retrieves the noodles and put in a bowl and put some of that tasty broth. He adds six wonton prawns and a steamed frond of bachoy. I could taste and savour the first spoonful of soup. Marina Bay Sand Rasapura, I am on my way. This place is glutton's world, a comfort zone of the hungry masses. Anything cooked in this place is wonderful. It is a place of adventure for people like me. This place do not disappoint
4
In a Mall setting, Rasapura offers the most amazing variety of delicious foods, deserts, teas, coffee etc. The set up is huge & as it is self service & very busy it takes a wee while to orientate oneself but it's worth it to persevere. Reasonably prices esp when you consider the location.
2
You would think when they clear the table...use a wet cloth the cloth would be clean well it stunk really really bad the entire time sitting you could smell this damp wet musty smell.... Hard TK enjoy food with this smell lingering....
1
Its better to eat elsewhere if you're looking for food court plates. Ridiculous portion and prices. And its just reopened from pest infestations.
5
at marina bay convention centre you can find an Indian restaurant, who cooks amazing food. you can have all your Punjabi dishes like Chicken Butter Masala, Dal tadka, Paneer etc.
3
Rude PRC lady at Chendol stall shouted at me to wait. When I told her that as a service staff, she should not be so rude, she kept insisting that she was busy and that customers have to wait and not disturb her.
2
I usually go here to eat my favorite meat ball noodles and chicken briyani but every time I see the people cleaning the tables I have second thought of going again. The piece of clothing that they use to wipe the tables stink and lingers on the table for a long time they don't use the proper soap and deodorizer to wash it. I may say the standard of cleanliness is going down. I understand that this area is a busy place but I don't agree that the cleanliness should be compromise specially for a eating place.
4
We went there twice, lunch and dinner. the black herbal chicken is recommended and my favourite is always the lotus root soup. La Mian is also not bad. The selections are vast and I liked the dimsum too.nice ambience and being seated next to the ice skating ring is not an everyday sight, although it was empty.Lunch time was packed so it harder to get a seat. I suggest to eat before lunch hour or after not during.overall, I am happy with my eating experience here
5
We’re not really hungry when we went to Rasapura Masters at Marina Bay Sands. We just had a light snack to keep us energized for the rest of the day. I ordered Popiah and mahal ordered Kueh Pie Tee. I’ll better make sure that we are really hungry during our next visit. This is one of the places where we can experience authentic local dishes and the choices are massive
1
I hated my experience here. It was very busy. So difficult to find a place to sit. I had Indian- Very under par. There is a queue but some people decide they would rather queue jump and still manage to get served-which i think is outrageous. I didn't return for the rest of my trip in Singapore and don't think i will ever eat here again
3
This place has a lot of variety of food from Japanese to Malaysian to Chinese and local Singaporean flavours ... and that is about it ! Tried the Kolo Mee ( Sarawak delight ) but unfortunately not up to par ( 2 stars only ) , even the Americano Iced was only a 3 star ! A little pricey here but this is Marina Bay Sands mind you , so expect to pay premium price for street fare ! You can view the skating ring here , good for a bite when the kids are skating 
4
Every now and then we go here with bigger groups to eat supper. Although this is a rather pricy place our guests always find some tasty meal which they enjoy, including drinks. Usually we find a table for eight or more people where we can eat talk and laugh together. Before or after dinner we usually go for a little stroll to do some window shopping. Bus 106 always brings us here and home again
5
Visiting this amazing food heaven is a must when you stay at Marina Bay sands hotel or just do shopping in the Shoppes. A range of different Asian cuisines at good prices,sometimes very crowded but clean and delicious!
4
Food is a bit pricey but you can opt to share it to split the cost. A good selection of Asian food to satisfy one's palate.
4
not so cheap but different asian cuisines are all over the places, including Filipino. Fast service among sellers.
3
Many times already we ate at the Rasapura Masters Foodcourt , when we visited the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall and Casino .The foods here considered as the most expensive compared to other foodcourts we tried in Singapore ,some dishes is about SGD 11-14 !My favorite is the Korean Food Stall , ate several times there.Friendly service by the Korean speaking girl ,fast service.Drinks are quite cheap about SGD 2Well, because lack of options of reasonably priced food in Marina Bay Sands , we are sure that like it or not , we must come back..hah
2
Why would you expect a lot from a food court? Well, you would at least demand better service, aside from considerable pricing. Would I pay double for chicken rice? Maybe. But rude service staff? Nope, didn't pay for those. Service is so bad it feels like I'm in someplace very rotten. But with an ice skating rink
2
I would have given this food court a much better review but this particular stallholder who I spoke to was one of the rudest hawkers I've ever met in my life. What is even more insulting is that he is the stallholder of the Singapore Fried Noodles stall (which coincidentally serves one of the worst fried hokkien prawn mee I've ever tasted), and needless to say, he's not even a Singaporean. Obviously the committee behind Rasapura Masters do not care about the authenticity of the food they serve or the kind of staff they hire.But overall, the food in Rasapura is pretty good, the staff in general are not the nicest people on earth but that stallholder at the Singapore Fried Noodles stall really pushed my limit
5
Rasapura masters is like a higher class of hawker, maybe because of its location. Food was good though, lots of options to choose from, different cuisines in just one location makes it very convenient although slightly difficult to choose what food to eat. I love the pepper lunch. Lots of tables in the area and they are clean considering its a foodcourt. This is a good experience of Singapore for me
3
A meal for approximately S$10 for each, you can have the same thing for half price in other food court. Some have good taste, but some is just so so. I love the fish soup counter which I think is the most decent counter there, try their 2 tone fish with milk soup to go with plain rice, nice and fulfilling for $8.
3
Do not expect much from a normal food court. I tried the curry noodle from the Sarawak Kolo mee stall- rating 4/10 ,bibimbap - 5-10saving grace is the fact that most item are less than S$10 so you cant beat the price in the location we are talking about. So i shut up and eat :-
4
Food courts do not come bigger or more full of tastier food than this one. Located on the far end of the Marine Bay Shoppes in the basement, this place has a skating rink which one day I think is going to make way for more food stalls and seating. It would make more money than the odd skater. The range of food is amazing. Deciding on which one to eat from is harder work than you think. Anyway if you miss you can always try again
4
Just like other food court, serve variety kind of food. When I eat there, the cleaning service seems like didn't have spirit to work. They put the dirty plates and bowls with loud noise.
4
While the setting may be sanitised the food is authentic and the locals seem to flock there in great numbers, to enjoy a wide range of regional recipes.
4
It is worth to try the Ng Ah Sio Pork Ribs Soup and the Chinese Dim Sum, especially when you have no time to visit the old shop.
4
Variety of food. It just that there were only few Halal option. I ate Ayam Penyet. The price was standard. During lunch time, 1 p.m. the place was very crowded.
5
The food Court at the Marina Bay is the best food court I have ever seen. The food is fresh and plentiful. The only drawback is that only one place has drinks. Do not miss this food court if you are in The Shoppes at Marina Ba
4
My favorite food is yong tau foo. They have best yong tau foo in town. beside young tau foo, there's so many variety of food here. My favorite dessert is mango pudding served with milk and fruits.The place is clean and comfortable. But most of their staffs don't speak english well. They prefer to speak chinesse
3
The plush chairs at this foodcourt certainly comes with a price. The choices are similar to what we get at most food courts but double the price. It is convenient though to grab a quick bite before catching the 8 pm Watershow at the Promenade upstairs. Food taste average. It is still a more affordable option amongst all the eateries at the Marina Bay Sands
2
As we were staying at MBS, we went to Rasapura to have dinner. We asked a question to one of the food court employees and he answer us in chinese, obviously insulting us for the gestures he performed and the look he gave to us.This is a constant in that shopping mall: people unfriendly and not welcoming tourists
4
This is in a large food hall in the mall next to the casino at the bay. I love curry laksa and this was a good one freshly made and generous. Worth the walk into the mall which, to me, was otherwise boring. Food is served at the counter and then you find a seat in the central communal area
3
Rasapura Masters is a quite the normal food court with some stalls and a lot of tables. The variety is decent, with halal food available at the Indian food and Nasi Padang stalls. There are also many other 'typical' Singaporean food stalls, along with beverage and fruit stalls. If you've been to a food court before, don't expect anything outstanding. It accomplishes what it's meant to do and it's a fine choice for slightly cheaper choice of food in the mall.Oh, it's also located next to the ice ring area so I guess there's that
4
Locals see this as a hawkers market type eatery.
Cheap and crowded fun.
Lots of counters, lots of choice.
Dull design wise.
5
you can select the ingredients you want them to cook for your dish (you can choose soup style or stir-fry. it was quite tasty and the price was very good too.
4
Went on a Sunday night and you've to be lucky to be able to find a seat! It's like a comfortable, air conditioned hawker centre, quite ok food with great variety but if you're looking for more authentic food, visit an actual hawker centre!
4
A food court with variety of local taste and reasonable price. It is beneath of the Marina Bay shopping mall. Shopping and eating can be done in one go.
5
fabulous, plenty of choice for everyone. Grab a seat, make a base then do a tour to chose any of the amazing delights on offer.Noodle star is great, you can see the chef making the noodle and dimsum freshly by hand throughout the day. Fresh juices are a winner, ABC (apple beetroot carrot is a hit)during lunchtime (1130 - 1430) it gets REALLY busy and you may even find yourself sitting at the same table but seperately
3
If you are frequent to your hawker centres, then this place is a upmarket version located on the ground floor of the MBS. Every occasion I have visited the service is quick and great value for money. I always go for the Beef Kuey Teow and my wife Prawn Mee. Both I would recommend. Finding a table is like a treasure hunt but this is Spore. Cleanliness and Service are both great and tables are serviced quickly. Romantic Dinner? I would think not, but a bite to eat or craving for some local fare its ideal. Prices slightly higher than a normal hawker but you are located right near City Hall
4
This place is a food court, have so many choices of food and beverages from different country, such as Chinese food, Indonesian food, Thai Food, Western Food and many more. During meal hour, this place will be crowded with people, so you must be very careful and fast to grab a seat. I choose Wonton Soup and it was delicious..
4
We had lunch over here before heading to the Gardens on the Bay. There are lots of choices but we settled for Japanese (Tonkatsu and bento box with crab) which was good and cheap. We ate early and it did start to get busy as we left
4
We had Indian food which was the first stop when you enter Rasapura Masters. The meal was quite good but maybe their menu could've used a bit more to make it interesting. The food court was clean and cool. Not too many people when we were there so that was good.
5
You can find international food from here. Open 24 hours (selected stalls). A lot of seats and easy to get your seat. You can try Thai, Japanese, Korean, Singaporean, Malaysian, Indonesian, Chinese food and much more. Homemade Barley Drink is good to try both warm and cold. The price is quite high but you will get very big dishes !!
3
The food court is average, but it's a big plus that you can drop by after clubbing, at 4AM, and get some noodles or dumplings before you call it a night.
4
The price is expensive , you have to spend $6-$20 here to eat and drink but the food is decent . I love korean food here.
4
Rasa pure was a delightful experience with its wide variety and quick service and affordable good food, loved the coffee and local bread and seafood dishes. we tried out many different things and have nothing bad to report about the place.
4
Good side: There's a lot to choose from different cuisine from Filipino, Thai, Indian, Western, Mexican, name it! They got it all.. Its a place to set your mood on food cravings.Down side: It is where all people go during meal time. A lot of chairs and tables but chaotic during peak time and hard to find place to seat.Happy Eating
3
Ordered pork meatball porridge for my daughter but the texture was bit too firm for her liking. Ordered roast duck rice for myself. Too little meat was given. The roast duck was not as nice as the one at 313 Somerset. Didn't seem very fresh. I was charged for the soup. Other members of my family also ate there.
4
This is one of cool place to have lunch, afternoon tea or even dinner. With various food from western, japanese, malay, indonesia, chinese, indian, some dessert and others kind delicious food. I've tried bento once and that was delicious with affordable price. All kind of food starts from 3,5 singapore dollars with average around 7 to 8 singapore dollars. Located inside a huge mall marina bay sands at the ground floor. Must try if you are a food lovers. But must be ready at lunch or dinner ti es because the chairs will full. The view was nice, near the skating arena
4
Great Food, Lots of choices but everything is marked up when compared to other Hawker Markets / Food Courts in Singapore. We have visited twice and the Pizza is great, drinks great too but drinks are $2-4 more than everywhere else and the Food is $4-10 more as well. Is the price justified? Probably not. Will be people pay it? Probably yes and they come in there droves. Clean and Tidy, by and indoor "ice rink" in a really smart mall
2
I was there at the Rasapura food court last July 20th and bought a plate of food from the Nasi Padang store. Had ordered 2 choices of meat mainly, a squid and a beef item + 2 vegetables (but I cant remember what I had). Total price for my lunch costs me $18.50 ALONE....I check with the Chinese male staff whom was serving me on the counter and requested for the breakdown of all the dishes and to my astonishments, he replied me saying "That's the total lah, all added up for you..."Seeing that he's a Chinese nationality, I kept me cool and repeated the same question again, this time in MANDARIN as I'm a local Singaporean Chinese.Very reluntantly, he gave me the breakdowns of the pricings of the 2 meats and paused for more than 5 mins before telling the rest of the vegetable dishes...I was there in the queue and was thinking... " DID HE JUST MAKE UP THE PRICES AS HE GOES ALONG".... there's wasn't any foodcourt management staffs on duty to be found and answered my quiries. For a moment, I was surprised that this is the standard of MBS Food Court, I should have dined at the nearby Suntec City or ION Food Mall.I wish that the MBS management will take a very seriously view on the Food Court Services rendered out to their diners, after all we are consumers...
4
It is an amazing food court with far so many varieties including local Singapore cuisine of course. It also has number of famous local stores in one spot. My fish sliced noodle in soup is very tasty and the fish balls soup from a Sarawak owner is absolutely tasty
5
Everything was fantastic here, except that the Char Kuey Teow is wayyyy below par. The best is the Singapore Wok fried food. It is just like it is in Newton Circus... Also, this is meant to be 24 hours, but when we went down after midnite, there were only 2 shops open...not much choice
4
The place was really packed and getting a table took a while.Being able to order different cuisines from the various counters was convenient.The prices are about 25% higher than other food courts as you are paying for the location.It is still worthwhile.
2
This food stall is a rip off with its meal package. Taste not that good. And the size is super mini. Don't fall for it like I did.
3
Marina Bay Sands can be expensive. If you are looking for low price food options while still getting great food, this is it. Very wide selection of international cuisines. Great local dishes and unique finds.
4
There are several food outlets offering Malaysian, Chinese and Indonesian meals and drinks. The Indian one is rather small and has northern dishes. I had the Indonesian meals twice and found them delicious.
5
Get the whole/half duck to share with the family - restaurant standard. The side of pork is also excellent (both are better than if you buy the individual duck& rice, pork&rice). My mouth is watering just typing it.
4
Food court located at Marina Bay Sands. Serves a variety of International cuisines – Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Indian, Malaysian and etc.. Our best orders that go with our fried rice according to taste were: Cereal Prawns, Fried Fish, and Black Peppered Beef.Cost ranges from $20 – 35 (Singapore Dollars) per order.Equivalent to the Hawkers food court but in a Marina Bay Sands standard. Compact place but tidy
3
This food court is one of two in the mall. They both have similar fare, this one has a larger selection. Overall the food is average, but the value is high for the food quality to price. If you want a quick decent bite while at the mall without paying the celebrity chef or other restaurant prices (with may be better food); the food courts are a great alternative
4
Tucked away near Marina Bay Sands Shoppes is Rasapura Masters, a nice selection of the finest hawker centers in Singapore. Have your fill of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Indian, etc. at the end of your shopping trip. The joke is that this is where you get to eat after you shop because this is all you can afford :)The Malay curry my wife tried was superb she said. My Japanese fare did not disappoint as well. We should have tried the dimsum made before us but we'll probably save that for another trip
5
Located near the skating rink at one end of the shopping mall at Marina Bay Sands, Rasapura Masters brings the best of Singapore hawker food to shoppers and visitors. Apparently created through a competition among restaurants and well-known hawkers, Rasapura offers an amazing variety of selections from Indian, Italian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese to Thai plus a hamburger place. Sounds a bit hokey, but it works. My wife and I visited Singapore in early April, a very hot time in a hot clime. While we enjoyed some of the neighborhood hawker sites, eating delicious offerings in the air conditioned comfort of Rasapura Masters was most welcome
4
the restaurant in Marina Bay Sands is really great place to visit if you are looking for variety in cuisines. We got indian veg food too though the thali was almost over. Good food. And the place is lively and happening. Self service is the norm. There are stalls for mexican, japanese, italian, indian, mediterranian, chinese food and maybe some other too. Reasonably priced. But do eat before 10 at night as they will all close down after that
