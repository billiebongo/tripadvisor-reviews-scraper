The poached eggs were overcooked, the banana hotcakes were underwhelming - served with a side of 'mixed berries' which was essentially a single blueberry, strawberry, raspberry and grape, and the service was poor.

Found this place when searching for food in the neighbourhood which is scarce. Easily accessible on foot being near the entrance of the compound, it is a major plus. Good place for a quiet lunch to chill and rest.
4
Service was great, waiters were friendly and attentive. The Lamb Shank was beautifully roasted while the Beef Brisket was towards the dry side, it still tasted good. Didn't expect the place to have so few patrons but this may be due to the location.
3
Food price on the high side for a lunch compare to Shopping Mall restaurant.
Food is delicious. Place is cooling as it is located at a slope.
Homemade Lemonade @ SGD6.

Great to celebrate special moments with family and friends cozy excellent exceptional and awesome place to gather with friends and good place celebrate special moments thanks for memorable and wonderful time

A few friends were going here so I decided to join them simple for the social aspect, I've been twice and both times the food was lacking to say the least. The recent visit was more of the same but worse. It appears that the cooks here (I can't imagine that they have a proper chef) learned their Mexican on YouTube as the food is nothing like Mexican or Texmex except they all use meat, onions and tortillas. Seems they have increased the prices once again as well. It's a great venue, hopefully the owners will hire a proper Mexican chef or go back to the Spruce concept
4
Must try their Pull Pork Burger ! Meat is soft and tender with sufficient marinate. The Churros is a disapointment compared to my 1st visit. They have changed the presentation and shrink the size of the churros. Texture is hard and not taste is a bit off.
5
Visited Coyote based on a friend's recommendation. To my surprise, this Tex-Mex restaurant is neatly tucked and surrounded with greenery. Superb green environment, friendly and attentive service crew, easy and casual dining settings are most desirable. Would definitely recommend for parties or after work happy hours
3
It's in Phoenix Park so best if you drive or take cab. If not it's a bit of a walk. Tex Mex food. Quite interesting menu. Good selection. Nice atmosphere as it's set among some trees. Reasonable food and attentive staff. Prices won't break the bank either. Nice for quiet meetings away from the rush of Orchard Road. Could be good for family gatherings as well
4
We have the restaurant chic card in Singapore, and thought we would try Coyote for a Sunday brunch meal. When we turned up we were given the choice of indoor or outdoor seating (chose outdoor as it was a relatively cool day and setting). Menu looked good for brunch, and discounted 1:1 margaritas made our drinks choice for us. Breakfast Chimichanga was really good and the chicken burger was huge and very tasty. Kids meal options were decent as well. Only small meal complaint was the chips with my wife's burger were luke warm at best.They have a bouncy castle for kids as well as a playground, so the little ones are set... we will be back with friends
5
really appreciate the waiter crew at Coyote, being attentive and quick. Food waiting time a little slow, I waited 30min for my food, but was okay because it was on a busy day.
3
Very few restaurants with this price tag bother to address their customers by name even though they know who you are through the reservation. The manager ensured our time there was personalised and that made all the difference. Kudos to that.
4
This is a nice place for a relatively quiet lunch on a Saturday afternoon. You can choose in the aircon section or non-aircon section of the restaurant. The food and service is good.
4
Service was friendly and warm, food served tastes different from usual western cuisine found at shopping malls, deifnitely worth the trip there to try out their Mexican delights!
4
For weekend brunch, restaurant was not overcrowded. Food was good (esp the Nachos!), service/attentiveness was ok. Additional boosters would be the free parking, and the outdoor playground which was a big draw for kids!
5
I had the pleasure of dining at Coyote recently. The waiters were attentive and the view was worth the price of food.
4
A pity that I went with wife only, so couldn't order much food. Had wanted to try other dishes. Should go in a group so as to try more dish. The portion was also big. Want to go back again.
5
We had all that and every item was surprisingly well prepared, tasty, good! Only the service was slow... as they seem short-handed.
5
We were lucky enough to have dinner inside with a wedding reception right outside our window. It was so festive and fun. Our dinner was excellent. I'm one of those picky eaters that has to order special and everything arrived exactly as I ordered. Even with the chaos of a wedding we had wonderful service

Visited Coyote with my friend on a weekday afternoon for lunch and stayed till it was dark. It's a very quiet place surrounded by greenery and away from Civilisations and buildings- doesn't feel much like you're in Singapore and I love the ambience of it! Service is amazing with the staff being attentive to refill your water and to ask if you require anything. I'm a huge fan of Mexican but I felt that the food here was a big let down. Quesadillas are my favourite and I usually finish them up real quick cause they're too good. However, I did not like it one bit here. I had to force myself to eat as much as I could and I managed 3 out of 6 pieces which was really sad. I had an iced Mocha too which I felt was really average and nothing like the mochas I've had out. The food here really isn't to shout about but it's definitely a great place to get away from everything and to enjoy some peace and quiet, would recommend it for dates too!
4
nice place for mexican food. at this place that used to be spruce. good selection of drinks as well.
3
My friends and I had dinner at this place back in September. The food is not bad, but i still think it is not authentic enough. The price is also a little expensive.
1
Food was mediocre. Most of the food tasted from off the shelf. Also, the pancakes were dry. Even Macdonald's hotcakes were much better. Lastly, the hygiene is bad. There were lots of ants in the toilet and there were ant nests with eggs.
5
Great food with awesome service ! The staff were very attentive and they threw in complimentary drinks. Will come back and dine again. Highly recommended for gatherings.
4
We like how the food was prepared. Very tasty and delicious! Very nice ambience in a park. Would love to go there again!
2
Coffee was bad, food is overpriced and small portions. Ambience did not fit the restaurant theme at all. Some of the staff was not friendly and sullen faced. This is such a huge contrast to the previous spruce where I had my wedding there. So disappointing
1
We had to wait over an hour for our food, even though the restaurant was not full (although they did have the sense to bring the kids meal after "only"half an hour). The adult meals, when they eventually arrived were missing key ingredients (guacamole, black beans). It's a huge shame because the venue is lovely and there is a children's playground, but we certainly won't be going back until it changes hands.
1
This is the most painful restaurant review I have ever written. It appears that neither the owners or chef have ever eaten real Mexican or TexMex food. As a long time, former resident of Texas and frequent visitor to Mexico I can't say that anything on the menu is either good or even close to authentic. As an example, the pico de gallo appears to be made with tomatoes, capsicum aka bell peppers) and pickles (or a pickled veg of some sort?) rather than the standard tomatoes, fresh jalapeÃ±os, onion, cilantro and lime juice. Numerous other items completely missed the mark as well. The prices are also outrageous, even for Singapore. $48 for 6 tacos (or $56 with service & GST)? No sides, just tacos.While it may surprise their chef, proper Mexican ingredients are readily available and affordable in Singapore (see Belmote Latin Foods) so there is no excuse for such poor execution. I truly feel sorry for the chef/kitchen staff as this is the worst attempt at Mexican food I have experienced anywhere in the world.Spruce was actually quite good, it's too bad that they killed it by trying to transition to a cuisine they clearly do not understand
4
Coyote has specials in most days, and the standout was definitely the Taco Tuesday. It's all you can eat tacos - choose from pork, beef, chicken, shrimps, vegetables, and fish - for only $25++! We had the pork, beef, shrimp, and fish. I can't pick a favorite cause they were all so good! If you wanna eat tacos on a Tuesday, I don't see why you should go anywhere else other than Coyote
5
We visited Coyote on a weekend evening. The place was nicely decorated with both indoors seating and alfresco seating. The waiters were prompt in serving us with the menu and subsequently, food.Food was great! We tried the enchiladas and Habanero Wings. Not to forget the delectable Nachos! The wings came with a generous spread of chilli sauce. The Nachos were generously layered with avocado and cheese. Quality service and Quality food.The staff were particular about service, and repeatedly dropped by to check on our needs. Service was commendable
4
Hidden Gem ! Try it to agree with me. Super love the Amigo Churros, so freshly made. Also the Chimichanga is good to share for ladies. Very tasty and authentic !
5
We had the burrito, chimichanga, and enchallatta plates, all exceeded our expectations. Especially loved the live guacamole station - had so much fun picking the ingredients! Will go back again, and again!
3
Food was average. Service inconsistent. Coffee was served without spoon and sugar. Not worth the visit
4
This restaurant is tucked in a very quite and romantic park. The restaurant is has nice food and quite ambiance. Definitely a good choice to bring your dates. The staff are extremely friend and i had a very good dining experience in coyote.
2
was not able to sit at the indoor air conditioned seating as there was a private event starting soon. as im pregnant i was very concerned with mosquitoes given zika situation in singapore. would not have gone to coyote if i knew the indoor seating wasnt available. both husband and kid got bitten by insects and i didnt really enjoy it. food was o

Visited Coyote recently. Solely visited this by my own search on Google. The menu, pictures, place decor looked very nice on google. The location is a bit off beat but it is worth the visited. Located amidst the High Commissions in Tanglin, it is a quite place away from the crowded Orchard. The ambiance was very pretty with good light and decor. We ordered the chipotle wings for starters (they have a good variety of wings on their menu), quesadilla and burrito. The chicken quesadilla was quite nice but the burrito was quite disappointing. I have had better burritos in Singapore and was expecting something better. Would definitely go back to try their brunch menu and their tacos too :) Menu was impressive but one visit is not enough to try everything
4
Mexican food lovers to note!You have one new place to have your nice jalapeÃ±o wings and if you are game for the hot wings, tell the lovely service staff to bring you the hottest one. You get Spicy, juicy and sexy!Coyorona, if that's what was named, after corona and margarita, make your choice less hassle. 2 in 1, will be the best beverage after the spicy wings and freshly made guacamole. I was with my peeps and we love the team service.Nice place for a night out, nicely tuck in a corner of Tanglin.Come and give your lip a lift soon! #hottestwing
4
Took my business associate to try out this restaurant. For starters, we opted for a quinoa salad, a huge portion which they split into 2 full plates. Grilled chicken with mango salsa and curried herb sauce was nicely done. Each and everyone of their staff was genuinely friendly and helpful. Casual and quirky atmosphere with alfresco dining. We will be back for sure
4
The food at Coyote is okay but the service is fantastic and there is a playground for the kids. On saturdays and sundays, they also have a bouncy house. This was the closest to a relaxing brunch my husband and I have had with our son
2
The menu of Coyote was exciting enough to drag us out Sunday morning for an early brunch. They are very vegetarian friendly, which was appealing. We had a Garden Breakfast, Huevos Tacos, Churros, Latte, & a Cappuccino.The food was bland and tasteless, the Churros were skinny with a gloopy chocolate sauce that was definitely not dippable. The saving graces were the coffee and the friendly service. I wouldn't really recommend the place
1
Oh dear, what happened? This used to be a real cool place but now it doesn't know what it is. TexMex? But with burgers and pasta? Food was pretty disgusting and place was empty and dirty. Don’t waste your time going out there.
5
The nachos and churros were extremely tantalising. If I had a 2nd stomach, I would've ordered another round of churros.
4
Enjoyable meal. Great vibes at this place that used to be spruce. Totally different concept, now being a mexican restaurant. But at least theyve kept the awesome sea prawn pasta.
3
It is a nice little place tucked away in Tanglin Road. The ambience was pretty good, however the brunch food was average - nothing extraordinary, and the service was poor - I guess they didn't have enough servers that day, the manager was taking orders.
4
The food was good and delicious. The ambience of the restaurant is perfect for a fine dining night. Friendly staff.
3
Quiet place to chill. Service was great. Nachos was warm and portion was generous for sharing. Tried the tequilla wings, seasoning tasted normal. Pulled pork tacos was nice, but my friend felt that the Pasta Con Carne (beef pasta) was too "strong" and "exotic" for his liking - actually i think it's very traditional mexican seasoning, so I guess it's pretty much personal preference
3
We were looking forward to some good elotes, but we were disappointed with the flavours. Not enough cheese on it. And it was a tad too pricey for one and half corn at $15. I must say we enjoyed the service provided by the service team. They are very friendly and definitely introduced us to a very nice tea - sea buckthorn
4
This restaurant is very child friendly and offers a good range of menu choices both specifically Mexican and otherwise. Service was prompt and polite. There is a good choice of drinks that are, by International standards, expensive as is the norm in Singapore. There is a children's play area and there was an inflatable play device that sadly was deflated on our arrival at 18.30pm
4
I used be a regular client on weekends at SPRUCE @ Phoenix Park, which 'Coyote by Spruce' has just replaced (they obviously belong to the same group) - which is how I learned about this brand new Tex-Mex restaurant. I had a great time there, the team has not changed, and are as friendly and welcoming as ever. Only the food has changed, and while they've kept certain classics (like the Steak & Eggs Benedict), they've mostly gone toward Mexican classics. They offer all kinds of tacos, quesadillas, salads, and sopas, plus chips and salsa, and other snacks to munch on with drinks -- and they have kept a good collection of burgers too, including the yummy 'Coyote burger'. With lively music, a big selection of different flavors of margarita, plus the 'coyorita' - which is a margarita with a Corona inside (sounds a bit weird, but delicious) - to me it's the perfect place to go with a group of friends, since the atmosphere is fun and casual. One of the friends I went with had kids, and the bouncy castle was a huge hit during brunch
2
Why do people feel they can make regional or ethnic food by reading cookbooks and not having ever experienced it? Coyote opened to great fanfare so we decided to try. The place is run by Indians, with Indian pictures all over the place. I like Indian food. A lot. But this is supposed to be a Mexican restaurant. It is not. It is a restaurant that serves food that is billed as Mexica, but doesn't look or taste like it. We tried the tacos and the beef brisket. Neither had any authentic taste. No salsa (we were given a bottle of store bought hot sauce). Tacos were not served with rice and beans but with a few tortilla chips. Margaritas were overly sweet. Avoid this place at all costs. There are much better Mexican restaurants in town.
1
The restaurant looked pretty on the outside, with a good outdoor space. However, food was really bad. The menu was confusing, felt like they were trying hard to be a mexican restaurant when they had no idea what mexican food was.
4
Steak Frites yummy
After the visit, realized that restaurant should give discount for charging using Citibank credit card.
4
Went for lunch but no sheltered carpark, not my preference.
Great experience for the ambiance and food quality slightly above average.
1
Service really not a TOP notch at all. Food quality is not standard anymore. Not even a star for this one. Good luck to anyone who want to dine here. Not worth to spend every cent here.
4
I've made a reservation for a Saturday brunch at Coyote by Spruce. When it was closer to the date, the restaurant staff called and provide an update on the latest changes of the restaurant (from Spruce to Coyote by Spruce and the changes in menu). Service and the ambience is good. We were well greeted by the staff (the same person who called) upon arrival. Because there isn't much crowd, the food was served relatively fast. We had Big Breakfast and Coyote's Breakfast, both were equally good. One of the staff even initiated to help us take some good photos. Overall, a very good experience
3
My biggest and main complaint was that Spruce's baked beans has been changed from their home made beans to something which tasted like it came from a can, and not even a good can of beans like Heinz' but some off-brand baked beans that were super sweet and extremely weirdly coloured. Also the scrambled eggs which were served to my wife were excessively salty.The pulled pork waffle was otherwise very yummy. But the slightly strange decisions made by the restaurant vis a vis their sides left us fairly disappointed
3
Love the lazy laid back feel with green all round. They have a great menu and good choice of wines. Dessert looks good too. If recommend this as the place to go for a long lazy lunch or a dinner where ambience is important and food is secondary.
3
Great location with some lovely, relaxed outdoor seating. We came Here for bruch on a sunday as a group of four adults and three young children. Service was slow to the point of non existent. It took ages to order and then the wait for our food was even longer. We didn't mind too much as we took the opportunity to catch up with each other, but I can see how others might not have been too pleased. The food and drinks when they finally arrived (more than an hour after we arrived) was tasty and well presented but other than that, fairly unremarkable. The kids enjoyed playing on the bouncy castle and in the playground. Service was equally slow when it came to pay
3
we went there for a family dinner on labour day. we were the first group to arrive but got served our food almost around the same time as two other groups that arrived 20 minutes after us. the food was okay, but the truffle bearnaise fries was a led down. pricing was generally quite affordable but when we asked for the check, we waited for another 10 minutes after passing our credit card to them. thy didn't have a lot of people then still. service was generally very slow but the waiters were very polite and even made the extra effort to provide water for our dog.
3
Spruce at Phoenix Park is nicely located. Spacious and private area for dining. The menu serve the usual western favourites and adequate. Food was not memorable. Service was awkward and can be fine-tuned, a bit more enthusiasm would do nicely. Thankfully the company was great and we overlooked the shortfall of food and service quality. Great site. A missed potential. Will not rush back
4
The ambience was nice for a special occasion. Mohan and the team had exellent service that made my dinner enjoyable. Will be back again!
4
The servers are friendly and specially decorate the dessert for us. The pasta is great too. Restuarant nicely decorated.
1
Disappointing visit to Spruce for a Sunday Brunch. Was told the food would take 1 hour to arrive as their kitchen is down, yet I still see food being served at other tables. No apologies, not even a glass of water from the service staff and manager. I ordered 2 glasses of lemonade but the manager seems to want us to leave. What a stark difference to the warm hospitality the other Caucasian guests are getting!
3
The staff were lovely, especially the man who served us. And their kid's menu is always going to appeal with chicken nuggets, fish and chips and cheeseburgers. The main menu has plenty to try, and the food's quite good. Nothing to rave about, but good. The Australian Angus tenderloin is a little on the small side, and the side salad is just leaves. But also nice. Worth visiting, but just for a casual night.
4
One of my favorite burgers in town! I love the Fire Station Spruce, not only are the burgers incredibly good, but there is also an interesting mix of American and Italian influence thanks to Chef Mauro Scotto. I even heard that he was the former chef and owner of a Michelin-starred restaurant! Definitely worth trying- and fun on weekends too for a leisurely brunch... Plus, thereâ€™s some live music several times a week
3
I was pretty shocked to receive a below average service from one of the waitresses. She basically rolled her eyes at me when I requested to switch to an indoor table (I felt like there were mosquitoes outdoors). Spruce did call to confirm our reservation a day in advance and we've clearly indicated to have an indoor table. Upon the request, she told my bf all indoor seats are fully booked and so I had to emphasize that I did make a reservation. Then she said "I can give you a table but I need it back by 8pm." Wow.... Tell me how should I fee
2
I popped in quickly to grab a takeaway coffee, didn't bother looking at the menu, just ordered a large flat white to go.It's definitely my fault for not looking at the menu but what I got was a small (average tasting) coffee for $9++.I'm sorry, what? $9? Live and learn - won't be going back for coffee
3
As my title says ... the food was not bad, we enjoyed it, but the service was slower than I would hope. That said, the servers were polite and pleasant, so an issue of load mostly. Place has an area for kids to play, which is nice, although bouncy castle was not working. Not a bad place, but doubt I would frequent
4
It was my third visit and I remained impressed by the cosy atmosphere, warm hospitality and elegant cooking. Nestled in a corner of Tanglin and Kay Siang Road, the location is unassuming with free parking. The surrounding fauna and flora add to the dining experience. Staff is always on their toes to cater to each customer's requirements. Matched by thoughtful cooking that considers the sourcing and preparation, I highly recommend this eatery for an off-beat experience
5
If you want to experience great food and great environment, do give this place a go. Nicely nestled in Phoenix Park along Tanglin Road it offers both refuge from the hustle and bustle of the city and a pleasant experience to the palate.A great place to entertain or to celebrate those special occasion. The service is great and the service too
4
Food were great; we were satisfied with our selections. The set lunch/dinner was value for money. However, service was extremely slow; but the quality of food made up for the slow service.
4
Had the garden brekkie and chicken benedict- fantastic food as usual- in particular the chicken benedict came with corn waffles. Great!
4
i fell in love with the restaurant the moment i entered. unpretentious and cosy feeling.
makes a great regular hangout with the girls.
my fav dish is the ahi tuna tartare!
4
The food is nice with a touch of italian cuisine. The fish crispy and the oil wasn't old. The location is great in the phoenix park with wind and animal.
4
At first Spruce looked like one of the many Italian restaurants in Singapore which is a little handicapped because of its relatively hidden presence. Due to earlier rain we had booked a table inside, a somewhat bland and rudimentary setting looking small and rather empty for a Saturday night. Then, we were pleasantly surprised by the warm and friendly attitude of the team and the good selection in the menu. The assistant manager Elgin and his colleagues were very attentive to all our requests and glasses never stayed empty for more than a few seconds. The food was generally fresh and well prepared and for the few friends whose meat was not exactly to their liking, they quickly prepared new ones and made us all happy and full. Though we enjoyed also the wines, it took us a while to find a good bottle due to their limited cellar and most wines on the list being sold out or down to last bottle. For an Italian restaurant they have to signifcantly broaden the selection and top up their stock for especially Italian wines. After dinner, to enjoy our deserts and coffee with a smoke, we went outside on the spacious and nice patio which had a larger capacity than indoors. Deserts as well as the ice cream were very good with large portions to satisfy even the biggest appetite. Overall, we enjoyed our evening at Spruce and believe to have found a new little gem where we will surely be back again
2
Have been here for breakfast previously and liked the casual atmosphere. However, went for group lunch recently as we thought this was a cafe type of place. It turned out to be a fine dining wannabe. Serves only bottled water and food portion was small and pathetic. The highly recommended ribs were not fresh and mash tasted awful. This will be my last visit.
3
The place offers good decent food. Had steaks and wines which were just right. The ambient setup was good. Serene place without too many people or noise on our weekday lunch.The only shortfor perhaps is the service. When we enter the place, we cannot find the waiter. After we ordered our food and in between our meal, we don't see the waiter around either as we needed to ask for wines, Short of staff I think. I would give it a four star rating if not because of the lack of service staff
2
It was not crowded when we came for brunch but it took ages to get a menu, took even longer to have our order taken and the black pepper we asked for never came. You can be waving from your seat and be consistently ignored.Food was mediocre for the price you pay. The mushrooms in my dish were soaked in oil and it spread onto the other items on the plate. Don't get me started with the desserts. Overpriced and lousy. $15 for a slice of chocolate cake that was dense and dry..go figureWon't be back and do not recommend anyone to dine here. Ambience isn't even that fantastic. Take your money elsewher
2
We had a Saturday brunch here (Bukit Timah branch), based on recommendations from friends. The brunch menu is fairly limited and uninspiring, not to mention expensive (e.g. S$23 for a caesar salad). I chose the most interesting dish I could find, the ahi tuna tarture with avocado (S$22). For that price, I was given half an avocado, five pieces of wafer thin toasted baguette, and some tuna tartare, which was too salty yet otherwise bland. My partner had the eggs ben on waffles, which was also unimpressive. Service was fine.There was nothing memorable about this meal, we won't be coming back

First time there with friends. Great ambience, good food & attentive and friendly service. Will come back for dinner!
1
First and foremost, I am not a difficult customer and it takes some pushing for me to write a very negative review. I have been to Spruce twice before. I always thought the service was poor but for some reason my wife seemed to like it. We went back today with our two young daughters of 8 and 6. We were welcome by a long queue with no waiter in sight. We tried to ask nicely for someone to attend us. Unsuccessfully. After 20 minutes of wait we decided to go elsewhere. The good thing is that my wife now agrees with me and we will never go back to Spruce.
3
Used to be packed many years ago and I was a bit surprised when I went yesterday. There were only a handful of tables. The staff was great -- friendly, helpful, but the food was below average. I ordered the big break and nothing on that plate was something I would allow out of my kitchen. The eggs ben were almost like hard-boiled egg and the bacon was soggy. It's a real shame since the environment is fantastic for a weekend brunch. It's an easy fix though -- get a new head chef
4
We have been to Spruce a lot, but only for breakfast. Their menu could use some change now and the service can be a bit slow especially when it fills up which is usually a given by about 11am on Sunday.They don't have tons of options for breakfast, maybe about 6-8 choices but these are consistently good. The banana hot cakes with a side of chicken sausage is usually a favourite of mine.Spruce isn't terribly cheap but it's a nice reliable place with both indoor and outdoor seating options. They also have a small kids playground which unfortunately has no shelter from the sun, so really only good for a quick play. As a result though it attracts a largely family crowd so there are usually quite a few kids around. If you have a family then it's fine. If you're a young couple looking for a quiet place, this may not be your first choice

Worse brunch experience ever ! Will never return to this place again. My friends and I (table of 4) arrived around 12pm, the place was crowded outside and inside. We placed our order at 12.20pm. It took ages to get our drinks and after a while of talking we found that it's been a while since we ordered and we could only see waiters/waitresses serving drinks. 45 minutes after palcing the order, still no sign and I ask a waitress what is the situation with our dishes. She just replied with a smile they have a problem with their system and the kitchen never got our orders !! Come on, seriously ?! Problem may happen, but at least the staff and the manager who seemed to even care about the sitatuation didn't even inform us or other tables. We could see that angry people were leaving. We've been told that the food was coming and a while later still nothing so we decided to leave, hungry and angry ! I do not recommend this place at all
2
Felt compelled to write after the poor service and value provided by this place due to the following:(1) We were seated outdoor, but when we requested for an indoor seat, the wait staff promised us to inform us immediately when an indoor place was available. When we saw that there was indoor seats, no one informed us, and when we asked to change our table, we were rejected by another wait staff who rolled his eyes when we put in our request again.(2) Our food took more than 45 mins to arrive. (we have the receipt with timestamp), despite us chasing for the food a few times. And even then, only 1 arrived. Due to the long waiting time, we cancelled the other one, and asked for the bill. The bill took another 15 mins to arrive.(3) I felt the portions was too small to justify the price tag.There's other better cafe choices around, and i would suggest to skip this place

If you do not want to feel disrespected as a customer, don't go to this Spruce branch restaurant at Phoenix Park. We arrived with two toddlers at lunch time today . Having seen the 'wait to be seated' sign at the entrance , we stood at the entrace waiting to be directed ( there were no one queuing then). After waiting for a couple of minutes, as no one was coming to serve us, my husband went inside the restaurant trying to get someone. He was able to get a waitress who gave us this 4 seats table we saw from outside while we wait . The next thing that happened was beyond our believe. While the waitress was cleaning the table, we saw a lady guest went straight pass the queue ( there were some other guests waiting behind us already then) into the restaurant and few seconds later she sat down at the table which the waitress was prepping for us. It turned out that the table was given by the restaurant manager to the lady guest. When we told him that the waitress has already given the table to us , instead of correcting his mistake of giving out a table that's already been given out, his response was: Sorry, she is a regular guest here so she gets the priority. We couldn't believe it . The manager could have given her any table that was NOT already given to anyone else, but he chose to disrespect us by snatching the table that was given to us to this lady guest showing the utter most disrespect to us as restaurant patrons. I have never felt as discriminated by any hospitality services as this restaurant did.So if you want to have a enjoyable lunch at a place where you are being treated as a respectful customer, don't goto Spruce

A couple of our friends threw a brunch party for us for their birthday last weekend. The service was atrocious- the staff took so much time time to come and take your order even after repeatedly going and asking them to come over and much more time to get the food. I don't mind if the food comes late and is good but unfortunately the food is below average. I ordered the standard English breakfast which was forgettable. Pancakes were bad. We ordered birthday cake for our friends was super expensive and extremely bad. Too sweet too dense- not worth having even three bites. Anyways not going there gain for sure. Nothing on the table of 12 people was good so definitely would advise you to give it a miss

To be avoided. Went with the family for brunch, and encountered a disastrous experience in all respects. We had to seat ourselves after waiting at the host stand for 5 minutes without being noticed. The entire restaurant looked like it had been hit by a tornado. It was a further 5 minutes before having to go collect our own menus. It went downhill from there. One meal was brought out 15 minutes before the others. All the food was poor to average. The staff were ridiculously incompetent, and at no point was service recovery attempted. Extremely poor experience. We had decided to give it a second try, but will not make that mistake again.

this is the place I used to to go for weekend brunch in my first year here at singapore, there used to be a salad with dates that was just too good but over the years the price has gone up but the quality of food has gone down. The ambience of the place is quite good but thats that - nothing special anymore

Kids friendly, nice brunch, the perfect recipe for my sunday morning.
there is a bouncing castle and a small playground. Don't forget the mosquito patch !
5
Great centrally located, leafy spot to bring children and adults for a weekend brunch. Service was very friendly, food was nice. We loved the playground on the lower level, tho the bouncy castle was having some issues when we visited. Overall this was a perfect location for a group of friends with young children and without. Everyone was happy

We were there for dinner yesterday and had looked at one of the placards placed on the table which featured wine promotions. The promotional price for a glass of white or red was $10. We ordered a glass of red to go with our dinner. When the bill was presented, we found out that the restaurant charged $13 for the glass of wine. Naturally we enquired and were told that $10 was a weekday promotion. My response was that nowhere on the placard did it say that was the weekday rate, in addition, it was also not explained to us when orders were taken as we clearly pointed to the placard when our order was taken. His response to this is 'prices are charged at management's discretion'. What does this mean?!?! I took affront to this and told him it's the management's discretion to charge whatever prices they want on the menu as long as it's clear. However nowhere does it say a weekday vs weekend rate. The same guy then told us that that was a happy hour price and unfortunately we didn't come during happy hour?!?!?It was only $3 difference. I just wanted to pay and never come back. When the change was returned to me, he told me under his breath that they are charging me $10 for the wine. I still wouldn't come back

Went for brunch last Sunday and experienced very poor service. There seems to be no training whatsoever, the staff is truly helpless...The whole thing dragged terribly - we spent two and a half hours there for just a one course brunch type of meal and a fresh juice. I honestly would have gone for dessert, but by the time we came to that I was feeling very warm and just wanted to go home (sitting there for so long) and anyway the staff never came to suggest dessert. It's a pity as the place itself looks really nice (although it's extremely noisy), and the food is not bad... But the service ruins it. A real mess. Avoid the stressful experience

We had a wonderful dinner and the ambience was excellent. Was introduced by my sis-in-law and their fingerfood was fantastic. Good for gatherings! But the place is located at a remote area so need to either take a cab or drive a car up. Highly recommended to visit
3
We went here as a couple for Sunday brunch and were decidedly underwhelmed. We sat inside which has zero atmosphere and horrible acoustics, we literally could hardly have a conversation as it was so incredibly noisy. Have never been in a noisier restaurant. Completely not relaxing. Waited 15 minutes for two coffees with a lot of chasing, but they were good once they arrived. Food was tasty but not good enough for us to go back, there are better places for brunch. If you have kids though, this is a good place, and the whole outdoor area was jammed with buggies, babies and kids
2
I used to go to Spruce for brunch very regularly 3 years ago, and decided to try it again last weekend. Unfortunately, the overall quality has dropped.Food. I used to be wow-ed by their plating, the servings but this time round, the serving was smaller than i used to remember, sausages were smaller basically, I was not wow-ed. I felt embarrassed for recommending this place to my friends and practically dragged them for brunch here. All of us finished our meals but did not feel satisfied, and definitely did not feel "yup, this is a good meal". I made a reservation prior and asked for an outdoor seat. Staff told me they will try their best. Twice. Fine with me, until we got there on Saturday noon, the place was half empty, so we got our outdoor seat. To me, just tell me you will give me an outdoor seat and not half promise me when you have so many empty seats. This place used to be packed during brunch time with queues. Maybe another sign?Based on my experience, it's not value for money - you pay for the nice environment outdoors. Food is not satisfying.. we need to eat something else after an hour (elsewhere of course)
5
I selected this place based on some online reviews. I went there will little expectations and did not make any reservations. The place was not crowded at all when I arrive at 9:15am (they open at 9:30am) on a Sat morning.I was given a table indoors but they outdoor seating looks good too. There was a sign stating that kids will eat free from the kids menu for any adult main. I asked the waitress whether I can apply the offer and she replied "yes". I ordered a eggs benedict and wife ordered a Ahi Tuna Tartar. My son ordered a tomato based pasta from the kids menu.When the food came, the staff told me that the waitress had made a mistake and that the kids eat free offer only applies to weekdays and on weekends. However, he immediately also said that they will extend the offer to me since it is their staff that made a mistake. I thought that was pretty good.The waitress that made the mistake later on came out to make an apology. I again thought that it was a good touch.The food was pretty good. Nice presentation and also very tasty. We really enjoyed the food. Ordered a coffee and a tea as well for wife and I. Total bill about SGD 64 including service charges and tax.When we were leaving, the staff gave my son a cookie. I think he caught us looking at the cookie display earlier. That obviously made my son's day. What a nice way to start the weekend. Will definitely come back again

For the mains, the pastas are really the showstoppers, because they were so confidently delivered that you thought you were dining in an authentic Italian trattorias. The Signature Prawn Pasta looked like anything, but a prawn pasta. This inventive dish born out of Spruce's first-generation American head chef to mark its opening, has been a popular mainstayer on the menu.  Luxuriously coated with spinach and zuchinni puree, the orecchiette (cat-ear) pasta is tossed with chopped sea prawns and savoury zucchini bits. Brilliantly peppered with grana padano cheese, the flavours are superior than an average basil pesto pasta; strong, garlicky without letting your fork paused for any moment. This is probably the tastiest prawn pasta I've ever had.The Squid Ink Pasta Carbonara is also too good to share. Being a carbonara fan, there have been many scary encounters of bad cabonaras being either too watered-down or too dry. This achieved the right consistency, though it could be less salty since there were already rewarding amounts of smoky bacon in the creamy swimming pool. The oven-roasted Chicken Pullet might not eclipsed the pastas in terms of richness in taste but it does have the power to win on its natural flavour. Served with rosemary velouté sauce, the effect is of simplicity rather than showiness. Visit user's blog under profile for full review and pics

I was in the Tanglin area and looking for a place to dine. I thought of Spruce at Phoenix Park and my dining companions went along with my suggestion. Spruce has two outlets, with the second outlet at Upper Bukit Timah Fire Station. I prefer this outlet, as it is closer to town. The staff informed that their menu has different offerings from the outlet at Bukit Timah, and there are new additions to their menu.After some recommendations by the staff, we ordered and here are the highlights of our meal:Appetisers- Ahi Tuna Tartar: Base of Avocado topped with fresh tuna and toasted thinly sliced ciabatta bread: The minced tuna was fresh and paired well with the avocado. Try it!- Crab Cake: Fresh crab meat, aioli and Asian slaw: The best dish for the meal. For crab cakes (ordered elsewhere in the past), I always get lots of potato. However, for Spruce's version, every mouthful was chockful of crab. Next time, I will order this and have it all by myself. A must-order!- Foie Gras: This was served atop a base of diced caramelised apple. The foie gras was a decent size and the diced apple was nicely caramelised. A perfect pairing. - Coconut Chicken Salad: The chicken breast was crusted with coconut and deep fried crusted. Sitting atop a generous serving of fresh salad greens with home-made horse radish sauce. The serving alone is good for one person's lunch! The sauce was also good!Main Course- Australian Lamb Rack: The rack of lamb is coated with dijon mustard and panko crusted and served with veal jus reduction. The lamb was fresh and nicely grilled. I loved the crusty bits of panko and mustard!- Beef Tenderloin: A thick cut of beef grilled and served with sautéed diced vegetables on the side. Although it looked overdone on the outside, it was medium on the inside. Kudos to the chef!- Smoked Duck Breast with Asparagus, Purple Mash Potato and Parmesan Cheese: I would prefer to duck breast to be thinner and cooked less longer, so that it is more moist.Desserts- Baked Ginger Date Pudding with Vanilla Ice cream: This is their signature dessert, and I loved it. It was served warm and I highly recommend this. It reminds me of Christmas which is just round the corner. Must-order!- Matcha Cheese Cake: This was a daily special. The cake is steam-baked and dense. After my first mouthful, i found the taste unique and couldn't put my finger on what was unique about the taste. After debating with my lunch group, I had to ask my server who replied that the cake had salt in it! After that revelation, we ate the cake again and we could inded taste the saltiness of the cake. Good for sharing, as it is 'heavy'.The portions remind me of America, where the portions are big. Good for sharing with friends or family.I like the food here and will definitely be back here again, especially for some of the food items that I tried on this visit. Do visit them and try their food soon

Wonderful service right from the beginning to the end. Service staff have good product knowledge and recommendation spot on for my family.
Definitely will be back again and hope the service standard maintains. The quality of food is yummy!
5
If you're looking for a great outdoor and relaxing ambiance for brunch with your family or friends, this is the best place to be! Food is a little bit expensive but really good and they have outdoor playground for kids too.

2nd visit to the Bt Timah branch for brunch. First visit was over a year ago and the place appears unchanged. Brunch menu offers a variety of eggs benedict to slightly more substantial American and English breakfast platters.Ordered the English Brekkie, Steak Benny and their house Spruce Benny. Food was not bad but neither was it memorably good. From presentation to freshness to taste to portion size, average sums up what we had. Service unfortunately is not lacking in room for improvement - attentiveness and friendliness barely made the average grade. Drinks took longer than food to arrive and needed some reminding. Even at 10am and at 1/3 occupancy. You quickly get the feeling most staff need some, if not a lot of, motivation. Perhaps, more training as well. Still, it's not near the worst service experienced and staff do get the job done eventually.Ambience wise, this moderately upmarket restaurant that was formerly a firestation has that clean, casual and modern industrial/NY loft vibe. There is both air-conditioned indoor and open-air outdoor seating and depending where you are seated indoors, strong drafts can stiffen a neck&shoulder or two. On the other hand, it can get pretty hot and sticky sitting outdoors. Did not see fans. Situated in a green spot along Upper Bukit Timah Rd, it's not the most easily accessible eatery to get to by public transportation unless that you take a taxi or live nearby or have direct bus access. Car owners though, will be happy that ample outdoor free parking is available. It's a pretty child-friendly restaurant in that the setup is pretty spacious and they have child seats available plus something on the menu for little ones. Expect to pay from S$25 up per person for a breakfast plate plus a cup of coffee. Would I come here again? Probably, if I were looking for such a breakfast or brunch place without reservations made elsewhere on a weekend or public holiday
5
We were regulars of this place (Phoenix park) from 2008-2012 before moving overseas... We just had an early Sunday BF and found it to be as good as we remembered it. Highly recommend the Spruce Garden breakfast and the soft scrambled eggs with Salmon. Lattes are still amazing (remind us if Sydney lattes)
1
Encounter bad service at my 1st visit to Spruce @ Bukit Timah Outlet Perhaps it is the post lunch hour? Or maybe I am not dressed appropriate like a worthy customer for your restaurant?? Or most likely your staff wants to take a lazing afternoon break??? But you shouldnt be letting potential customers stand at the entrance looking at the menu and cakes without a hint of service. 3 of your staff saw us but they all turned their heads away. What's more, we were already standing in the restaurant like a silly.Can't I even have a cake and coffee for my tea time? Really bad service in my honest opinion...
4
premise - its a refitted fire station of old and has nice touches of chic and 'coolness' to the placelocation - upper bukit timah and free car park. had ample smoking areastaff - smiles and smilesfood - we didnt have any but the desserts was ok, didnt take a pic as the tummy was impatient. had wine too (missed te happy hour by THAT much... sigh)crowd - mainly yuppies, families and teensverdict - good for late evening chatterbox session

We enjoyed a very good Saturday morning brunch at the Phoenix Park/Tanglin Road location and loved the outdoor terrace surrounded by greenery. The service was fast and efficient, food tasty (with poached eggs cooked to perfection) and good coffee all for a good price. Will definitely return
2
The restaurant's setting is not particularly appealing but, given that this is a refurbished fire station, it comes with the package. The restaurant is quite well restored and the layout works well with the main bar in the centre. However, this is where the music stops. We ordered two salads and one burger and, for the kids, pasta. The Caesar Salad tasted funny and the dressing made it inedible. The "signature salad" had a chemical taste and was barely edible. I had to force it down with water. In hindsight I wonder why I bothered.The worst part of this experience was to realise that behind me, in a corner, a Rentokil Rat Poison Box full of pellets had been left there with my kids playing beside it. Luckily I realised in time.I had to give two stars just because the management realised the mistake and gave a 50% discount. Will I be back? Not in this lifetim
3
Had lunch here with friends. Good food: both the salads (Caesar with crab meat and Spruce special) were excellent. And so eas the risotto one of us ordered. Too bad the coffee after the meal was undrinkable. They have the right equipment, but either don't know how to use it or don't clean it properly. Too bad!
3
Comes hugely recommended but we found the brekkie options fairly underwhelming. The service was slow, kids menu options uninspiring, the thick bread novel but prone to drying up, the butter only forthcoming when ordered, the sausages slightly overdone and the eggs a tad watery. The kids enjoyed the outdoor play area for about 10 mins - it was quite dirty, as in hasn't been cleaned and wiped down in days dirty. A 100$ later, our family of four drove off wondering what the fuss was all about...
5
Great place to chill and have a couple of drinks with friends. Quiet and nicely tucked in an area where you have adequate privacy. Good selections of beer and food.
4
If you're in Upper Bukit Timah, this is a great place for a friends/family meal. Plenty of parking, good set lunch on the weekday I went, light with a sense of space and style. I'd come back.
5
Great tuna burger and signature salad. It was busy and slight communication difficulties around allergy issues.
4
Went there for brunch with friends. It was a nice place though the food portion a bit small.
The location a bit secluded and it reminds you with ps cafe at dempsey.
Please make a reservation before.
4
Had my dinner there thrice. quite a cozy place for catch up with friends and colleagues. Parking area is limited but this place is away from town area as well so there is not much of a crowd (which is good!)Price wise maybe towards the high side but for the ambiance it is worth it

Visited Spruce's branch which is located at the old firestation at Upper Bukit Timah Road. We had dinner at Spruce and I must say that it is quite an enjoyable experience. It has a quaint feel at the restaurant as it is used to be the firestation and the food that we ordered is generally good. I had fish and chips while hubby ordered their famous spruce burger. We were not dissapointed. The fish and chips portion is huge and their fish batter is super crispy and not oily. Hubby's burger is juicy and yummy. Ended our meal with an oreo cheesecake which is creamy but not too rich. They also have a super long happy hour on monday and tuesday : 3.30pm to midnight...More detailed review and photos@http://eatplaycook22.blogspot.sg/2014/05/eat-sprucefirestation-upper-bukit-timah.htm

Out of the two "Spruces" I prefer this one ... Food was good in both but the service here was more attentive. I like the setting too. Although it is close to Orchard/Tanglin rds it has almost a rural feel. Would be keen to come back in the evening.... A relaxing place..
1
I visited on 1 May at 11am. I tried using the hungrygowhere booking late the night before, interested to know how restaurants manages such a third party based system like opentable. It matched my expectations that that reservation wasn't relayed. What a lousy system!We ordered the big brekkie, eggs Benny and the Bloody Mary (1 for 1). The quality was horrendous. The mushroom and eggs were tasteless and my family who ate the eggs Benny all had bad tummy upset. While it is not conclusive, we just get a bit worried. The Bloody Mary was ok but a bit pricey if not for the 1 for 1 deal. The 2 glasses taste different so in terms of consistency, it leaves much to be desired.
2
....which is ok if you have children that enjoy a good run around and a reasonable scream during lunch, but not if you dont. The service is very hit and miss. We arrived for a Sunday brunch and waited at the door for quite a while but when nobody appeared we wondered into the restaurant to seek out the elusive staff. We were then severely admonished and told to return to the entrance and wait.The venue was about 80% full and extremely noisy to the point of headache inducing. Children were screaming, crying, whining, running around. The service was a little slow, but staff came to take our order after an awful lot of arm waving.Food appeared quite quickly; mine was the signature pasta - imagine my surprise when it turned out to be shell pasta in a bright green sauce with no garnish. It looked like something that might be served at an Adam's Family banquet but tasted ok. My friend had the big breakfast which he said was good.We had dessert; ginger date pudding and apple pie, both quite nice.Overall the food was good, (but strange) but the atmosphere was too noisy and the staff, as mentioned in all the other reviews, still need to up their game given the prices.Wont be back because of the noise

I booked the restaurant for dinner for the 7 of us because I was intrigued about dining at the old Bukit Timah fire station. I grew up with this as a landmark and the location is actually very good. We sat in the area where the old fire engines used to be and it brought back memories for my daughter, now 18 who visited when she was 5!!!! Service was good ... in some cases very pleasant and warm in other cases a bit cold but still efficient. The tapas plates were tasty but with very small portions esp. for the price. This turned out to be true for almost all the dishes .... prices were high for the area (out of town) but portions were average to small. Food was generally quite tasty but as far an American fare goes, $18 for a burger with a patty less than 3in in diameter is somewhat dissapointing. The biggest dissapointment was the cheese plate, $25 for what seemed like morsels of cheese ... I am not joking!! On the contrary the cakes were massive and quite good .... go figure!!!! I gave 3 stars for the novelty especially if you have kids or old folk that might remember the place. Apart from that, a second visit will not be high on my list list of priorities.
4
I like their pasta & cupcakes.. especially Red Velvet.. although they are famous with their but yet I still haven't tried, weekend always fully book for brunch.. definitely will visit again.
4
I went to Spruce on a weekday at lunch time and the food was good while the service was reasonable.
Overall I would visit Spruce again as I was pleased with the ambiance, the greenery and food.
5
Working in Phoenix Park office campus, Spruce is a jewel of a restaurant. Quality is very good and service always kind and professional. I love Saturday&Sunday brunch. Atmosphere is always relaxed and casual, perfect for families with kids and couples as well. I never tried dinner, just breakfast, lunch, brunch
4
We had dinner here last Friday night. More than adequate for a relaxing meal with partner or friends. Definitely not a show stopper with food and service. Service was average and considering it was a quiet night, we were surprised that we had to look for the waiters. Three of the four had the Spruce burger and to be fair, it was nice. Our other dining companion had the tuna burger and it was apparently very good. Entree sizes were very generous. The chicken wings were large enough to share, even for 3.One of the big selling points is the outdoor seating. It makes it a relaxing meal, just what we needed after a hectic work week
4
I heard about Spruce for sometime, so decided to head there for dinner, to try out their "wholesome and unpretentious American cuisine served with warm hospitality" as quipped from friends and Spruce's website. es, esconced in a rather inconvenient location for non-drivers, rest assured that Spruce makes it up to diners by offering a peaceful, lovely and enchanting dining ambience that makes your arduous journey well worth it.The first Main Course - the Roasted "Pullet" Chicken was served - served with vegetables, desiree mashed potato in rosemary veloutte. The slightly charred taste of the tender, juicy chicken was lovely, the meat was smooth as well. The mashed potato was infused with the fragrance of rosemary, and the texture was milky as well.Lastly, the Mushroom Risotto - with Porcini mushroom and truffled hen egg - one of the most delicious I've eaten, especially mixed with the sweet silkiness of the egg. The mushroom rice was absolutely flavorful, and the texture was cooked to softness without being mushy.I understand the fuss over Spruce now, and would definitely be back for more, maybe try their famous brunches as well.For more detailed information and photos, please check out:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/dinner-at-spruce.htm

We made a booking for their function room which is good for 16 pax to celebrate our civil wedding. Their sommelier elgen made a good wine recommendation for our group. Their staffs are attentive, professional and polite. The food was amazing and absolutely worth the price. We had a wonderful and memorable experience and highly recommended! They help us also to call a cab for that night which we really appreciate!!

Spruce over promise and under deliver on it's Cesar salad with crab meat and tomato momotaro! I paid a premium for the salad for the tomato momotaro, but they looked and tasted like the local tomatoes which are tasteless and orangy red. Momotaro is supposedly red and juicy inside and quite sweet and tangy at the same time. I didn't get to enjoy what the menu promised. The crab meat smell fishy. When I feedback to the service staff, the manager told me the crab meat is frozen.. I am reading between the lines : " so expect it to be fishy and unpleasant since it is frozen" . That's fine, I don't expect fine ingredients but if a salad costs almost usd 20 which is more than ahi tuna tar tar, then I expect quality. The romaine lettuce was feeble looking, lacks crunch that I expect. For gods sake, it's a Saturday brunch, if you can't even deliver freshness on a Saturday with huge traffic then when will you do so? The creamy dressing is not too garlicky which is a good thing but it's boring!!! Perhaps something citrus and olive oil to bring the frozen crabmeat to live???!!! It was a large portion but we are not in a camp.. We don't need quantity here. Service manager was kind to offer a replacement but I said no , coz I don't wanna waste food and there's a 50 percent chance that it would turn out bad. True enough, my girlfriend who exchanged her fishy crab cake for pasta, and it was bad too. Maybe only good thing is the burger, but my other girlfriend said the burger was a bit dry.. She was being Asian and polite ;) The only thing is the fairly good service and the latte was drinkable. Latte is not served in a tall glass which is typically served elsewhere and I only taste milk instead of coffee.

This place is out of the way so pretty empty weekday lunchtime Service was prompt, pleasant and unpushy. Had the snapper with fennel salad. Very tasty - SGD27. I liked the decor but there is no view as there is a main road one side and a car park the other. It was a pleasant place though and I would come back (with a friend who has a car!) and try the mushroom risotto..
3
The location to the restaurant isn't really convenient but the environment is peaceful. It's an old fire station that's been converted into a restaurant. We had heard that the service was slow but to our surprise, the waitress was quick in taking our orders and our food came out quite fast. My son had the mushroom risotto & it was really delicious. I had the Spruce Boston Clam Chowder & Prawn Pasta. The Clam Chowder was just ordinary but I enjoyed the prawn pasta. The pasta was served with prawns chopped into tiny cubes in zucchini & garlic cream sauce. My husband had the Spruce burger which is their chef's recommendation. It was delicious but a little small. The ambience of the restaurant was pleasant & the staff that served us was friendly

This is the second time we visited this restaurant. The previous time we were there, we noticed a family dining outdoor with their dog. We thought that it is a dog friendly place, so we walked our dog together with 2 young toddlers all the way from our home to the restaurant for 30 minutes during our second visit. Upon arrival, we were rejected by the service staff from dining even outdoor. To add on, she did not even allow our dog to be left out of the perimeters of the restaurant in the carpark, claiming that no dogs are allowed in the whole Bukit Timah Fire Station compound.As it was inhumane to walk my 2 famished toddlers back home with no food places around the area, my hubby had to walk home with the dog and return again to pick us up in the car. Upon clarification with the operation manager, leaving the dog out of the restaurant perimeter is allowed. Suffice to say, there was no standardisation in enforcing their regulation, creating such inconvenience and displeasure to the whole dining experience
5
We went there for lunch. The Upper Bukit Timah Road location is in an old fire station. Very open and spacious. We had fresh tuna burgers with avocado and seasoned fries. Also fresh brewed ice tea.
1
Poor service, ruins everything there. Good food but overpriced especially considering the terrible service.
4
My family and I have eaten twice now at the FireStation location and have good experiences on both occasions.Food is simple and good, and incredibly fast in terms of delivery. Staff were overall pretty good although I did find it odd that we didn't appear to have a waiter dedicated to our table. I wasn't entirely sure who to give the tip to at the end of the meal.Great for kids too - cheerful kids menu that mine enjoyed.Very popular for brunch on Sundays so booking is essential
2
Tried the 2nd location this time, in a cute space at the former Bukit Timah firestation. The pros: nice decor, free parking. The cons: arrived at 11:40 in the morning, told the place was full and we would have to wait till noon for a table. So we said we would eat at the counter. The server then changed her mind and showed us to a big table for 4 (we were just two), by the big window! A great seat but why out us through that nonsense earlier? And by the way the whole time we were there the tables around us were not occupied. After that service was fine if not outstanding. We shared their burger (classic, with bacon on top) and the brioche French toast. The burger not as memorable as before, a rather small patty drowned in sauce and pickles. The French toast was fine but rather stingy on the mascarpone and jam topping. With two coffees that came to over $50. Not terrible but doubt I will be back
4
Nice restaurant for a weekend brunch, with indoor and outdoor sittings. Food is good and prices are reasonable. Eggs benedict on corn waffle was a nice twist. Didn't noticed any buses passing the main room, advisable to go and leave by taxi. The place is children friendly and there is a play area with slide. Reservation in advance to avoid disappoinment. Seems a little under staffed, as they make customers wait before being sitted, although restaurant is not full
4
Spruce now has 2 locations - Phoenix Park (original location) and the old Firestation location in Upper Bukit Timah. Had Sunday brunch at both, and food and service were basically the same at each. The Phoenix Park location has a bit more outdoor ambience (more trees around) but the Firestation location is more accessible from the 'burbs. Read the menu thoroughly as some classic items are in small print and not highly advertised. Everything we've tried has been tasty. While it's not a cheap place to eat brunch, it's a good value compared to the local hotels buffets and other brunch places. Crab cakes, Eggs Benedict, Pancakes... (Firestation also has FREE PARKING!
1
Arrived with the family for a quite, late Sunday breakfast. and althought the ambiance is good, the service downgrades this place phenominally. I ate my breakfast before the wife's breakfast came. The coffee and sprite were forgotten. I had to wait 10 minutes for salt/ pepper and Ketchup. No, this is by far the worst experience I have had in Singapore.If the owner employed someone who looked at the customer (not only for the next one) and staff who were interested in the business. So sad as the place sound really be a good one considering the location and ambiance.I feel so upset I don't want to waste more words on this place. The only advice I would give to others is that if you go, be prepared to be disappointed,
1
Unfortunately, we can't click a zero on here, because that's what this place is worth.The one star is for the location. It is at a corner plot of land in Phoenix Park. Ample space, good air, we were excited when we were seated for service.Then came nothing. Service was HORRIBLE. The servers seemed fatigued, unmotivated, uninterested in making eye contact with the diners lest they get called.Table water came with the third request.Table cutlery was incomplete, we had to make do, we couldnt get the attention of the waiters and waitresses...as you know by now.My burger came medium rare, when medium was the order. Tastewise, nothing like a chargrilled cafe burger I envisioned, more like a fastfood burger. But with cafe prices.My daughter had the cajun hash. Roasted vegetables with scrambled egg on top. Frankly, how difficult is it to roast vegetables?? This was dry, tasteless, and the egg was overcooked.The crowd was there today, it was Sunday. Why they were there, perhaps it was like myself, to try a new place for brunch. For me, there will be no return trip.Final straw was when the bill was asked for. Ten minutes passed without a bill emerging.I had to approach the cash register, before I finally got attention. It was tiring. I forgot I went out for a simple Sunday Brunch.Don't bother with this place
4
Located in a quiet area just in the city, the restaurant serves very good food. The menu is not extensive, but the quality is good.The biggest area for improvement is service. Whilst I appreciate this seems the norm in Singapore, the industry here needs to lift the game. Staff don't seem motivated, happy and don't really know the menu. From the time you visit the front desk to inform them of your booking to the time you leave, you are left wondering about all the improvements which can be made.I think 4 stars is generous, but 3 may have been a bit harsh

This past Saturday (before the haze set in) my boyfriend and I stopped in at Spruce during the middle of a long walk for a bit of food and a drink. They seemed to have a wonderful brunch menu though I decided to go with a burger instead. Despite its small size it was super tasty and I washed it down with a delicious IPA that is not on the menu. The service was wonderful as well! Will definitely be going back

Ate here with 2 friends on Thursday 9th April 2013. 2 of us got food poisoning from the Tapas.
Tried to report it to the manager but still waiting for a call back.

Great place for breakfast or lunch - offer both indoor and outdoor seating. Food is very good, service pretty good. Great for families with kids - they have a play ground and a good kids menu. Will for sure come back.

I think service could be faster. Eg. Refilling our water can be promptly. Kids meal was delicious. My children enjoyed e free lollipop at e counter.

Been reading many good reviews about Spruce, their food and cosy ambience... went there finally after 1 years... very disappointed...Was there on a Saturday afternoon, there were just 4 tables occupied. Ordered the Big Brekkie and was not very impressed by it. You could actually count the number of mushrooms on the plate and the german sausage was very salty...It was very difficult to catch the attention of the staff, although there were more staffs than the customers at that time.when it was time to call for the bill, i got to walk up to the staff and asked for it...Not impressed by it, not at all... for that price, i could actually find another place that is much better

It is honestly quite difficult to find a good brunch restaurant in Singapore. I had heard some good things about Spruce so i was keen to give it a try. After getting a few dishes and sharing with some friends, I would say that the only dish I would go back for would be the Egg benedict with crab cake (But maybe it's because I am a sucker for crab cakes). The Mac & cheese that so many people raved about was terrible! it was bland and powdery, as if they hadn't cooked away the flour properly in the roux. The hash was a little undercooked so the vegetables were really hard and the potatoes were also not crispy.Not sure if I would be keen to go back

I've been coming to Spruce for the past 2 years. About twice each year. I come here mainly for the coffee and atmosphere, which is good. However there is a very noticeable decline in the taste of their food. The breakfast now comes with soggy greasy bacon, beans are cold and the scones have lost their texture and fragrance. Compared to two years ago, the price absolutely does not equal quality

We found this place, very highly recommend, to not be great value for money for dinner meals. We had the sharing plates to start with a group of 10, then I had the burger, and a brownie sundaw. The food was good, but the ambiance was lacking. Super loud people there and the music was really loud too. Hard to hear each other talk. The wines were okay, but, again, expensive. Heard that brunch is better here

Went and arrived at 130pm on a saturday afternoon.. bistro was half packed, with a few vacant tables. We ordered a sig burger and sandwich plus 2 coffees with a snobbish looking indian lady. Thereafter, we waited for 30 mins and was getting impatient, called a waitress to inform them of our wait. . 15 mins passed and still no food on the table. Not even the coffees! In total, 45 mins. Its only after 45 mins of wait were we smart enough to cancel the orders, and its ONLY then that we got all the attention from the staff. How can such service standard survive in this stiff competition in singapore. How??

This is the SPRUCE branch set up in an ex-Fire Station. Free parking. Quite pleasant surroundings for meal. Salad is huge enough for a single meal. Soup is also quite generous portion. The burger is $18++ but taste better than popular fast food chains because you can decide how the burger is cooked. The French fries are crunchy. Drinks are expensive - fresh orange juice $8++, 50cl bottled still water $7++. Currently, Citibank credit card has 15% discount on food bill

Happened to pass by this place and decided to give it a try. It was fully packed and probably food will be nice. Most of the customers came in with reservation. So we have to wait till they allocated the seats to them before we can have ours. The deserts displayed looks great but we didn't get to eat any cause my girl couldn't wait to go off because of the crowd and noise compacted in a glass house. We have a hard time deciding what to eat cause there really isn't much choice. For kids menu, it's even limited. My girl had the fish and chips which was plainly served with apple juice and nothing else. For $12, I must say, it's not worth it especially the fish its coated with thick layered of batter. Usually she can finish almost all but after a few bites, she said she's full. I guess it's the flour.My maid had a $18 beef burger with a few chucks of fries. Definitely not very appetizing and tough to chew. For me and my hubby, the sausage meals look very much like breakfast menu rather, even though its on the lunch menu.The bread was burnt, sausage too salty, other than that the rest taste good. But for a $19 meal, I guess, it's a little overpriced.The service is reasonable fast. There are about 12 staff serving both at the bar counter and the restaurant. Definitely our first and last to visit Spruce

Sit outdoors, find a quiet corner and get a bottle of bubbly for a long lazy Sunday brunch with good company. The crazy long queues have gone so it's manageable to get table without the long wait.Food and service are fine but the atmosphere is what you come for. Clientele is a mixture of expat families and young couples on weekend morning dates

A great restaurant with extensive menu for brunch and attentive service. Most importantly, it's got a great ambience. Always ask for the outdoor seating, you feel like you're dining in the forest. A personal favorite of mine is the Eggs Benedict Crab Cake, it's to die for. But I tried most of the other stuff on the menu and they are all equally great. The only drawback is that the prices are astoundingly high - spending nearly $80 in one brunch sitting is quite painful. I'd definitely go here way more often if only they lowered the meal prices by a little. Overall, a great place for the occasional brunch when you feel like splurging

Nice place to relax over a Sunday morning breakfast / brunch. A little on the costly side, especially the drinks - $6 for a very small hot chocolate that was gone in one gulp! Everything (food and drinks) was good quality and tasty, and service was good despite the place being completely full. We will be back.A huge thanks to the honesty of the staff, who ran out to the car park after us to give me back my mobile phone - which I had left on the table without realising.Thanks again

Went for Sunday brunch and was delighted with the company. Food-wise, I thought my Crab Cake Benny (S$25) was just ok. While the crab cake was full of luscious sweet crabmeat, it somehow didn't match taste-wise with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. The back bacon was overcooked till dry and hard. The Big Brekkie (S$19) was tastier IMHO. Juicy mushrooms and tomatoes, with fresh eggs! And I love the foccacia toast.Service was warm and attentive. Just a note tho, the air-conditioning was turned on at full blast, and it was quite chilly, just mere minutes after entering the cafe. Ceilings were high, so noise and chatter were amplified

Ordered oysters and was assured by the staff even the manager that the oysters are fresh but they were served room temperature and slimy . Ate one piece and was not fresh and spoilt my appetite after that , I can't even make myself to order the dessert , in case I have the bad experience Keep fingers cross I won't get sick by eating the one tiny oyster tonight

We had breakfast at Spruce over the weekend . A lovely setting along Tanglin Road, so green and just the perfect spot to enjoy breakfast - but make sure you are there early as once the families arrives with small children it is not so nice anymore. I have never really found the service very good and some waitresses rude and arrogant. Food nothing fantastic but for breakfast not bad either. However on my last visit my bagel was very stale and resembled a biscuit. I did not eat it and told the waitress that the bagel was not fresh. She took note but never said anything. I called for the check and the manager came over and introduced herself , apologized and charged me for the tea but not the meal which I appreciated.However Ii thought the waitress should have informed the manager and I should have been given the option to order something else . Will I return? Maybe

The outlet at Bk Timah is nice and cosy with free parking. But I do find that the price for food is about expensive. Tapas of 2 choices is $18 which consist of 4 slices of croquetas with parma ham and 4 small pcs of fried batter with mushroom is abit expensive.

There's no point complaining about service. Unless you go to a top end place like CUT, service is non-existent in Singapore. To the better things: breakfast is delicious, with items like soft scrambled eggs with caviar and salmon leading the cast. Coffee is good, but not inspiring. Having said that, it's probably an 8 on the Singapore Coffee Scale from negative infinity to 10

I went here for lunch today for the first time. The set up is similar to the restaurants at Dempsey, fairly casual lunch time menus with nicely presented courses.I had the scrambled eggs on a muffin with some chicken. All cooked v nicely, and served well by helpful and friendly staffI will go back when I'm off the diet

Nice restaurant located in a beautiful greenery. You can escape the hectic of Singapore`s business life bay having nice cakes and coffee or proper lunch or dinner at Spruce.It`s one of the restaurants in Singapore where I also really like the professional staff.They are attentive and charming and always at your service.The wine is of good quality and pretty reasonable .Like this place

The service was great and the food was delicious. Portions were very generous. Wine pours could have been more generous. Overall a vet nice dining experience.

The family went to Spruce for dinner. The food was very good particularly the short rib and steak. My wife who does not usually eat risotto loved their serving. The short rib and tenderloin were all very flavorful and tender! Worth another visit.

These guys do not respond to email or phone. When visiting in person their service is similar. Definitely not a place to return to.

We went here as it was advertised that it did a good brunch with an undercover playground where children could play whilst you watch them and have your coffee. This is not the case. The playground is outside and cannot be seen from the restaurant. That aside though, not a bad place. The service was erratic and our drinks arrived a long time after our food, but the food itself was really good. Good portions, cooked well and well presented. Overall an ok brunch, our 3 year old had a play around at the park once we had all finished eating

We are regulars at spruce at phoenix park. I cannot fault it. It is one of my top picks of restaurants in Singapore. Breakfast is simple and tasty. The tuna tartar, the garden breakfast or the breakfast burger are hard to pass up. The mac cheese is heavenly. The coffee is great and the service is incredible. They are always so accomodating when we go there with our toddler. They always let her choose her own cup, plate and cutlery colours and there is a playground nearby to play in. A very sweet touch. The atmosphere is great and for a busy place it is actually very easy to relax. We always go early around 9.30 and have never had to line up. Its a great place for a get together with friends too

We love the brunch here. Big portions, american sized servings and all fresh ingredients. My daughter and husband went for the egg benedict done in several different ways - I went for the crab salad with momotaro tomatoes with my kir royale - yummmers! Price could set you back a little but hey, when you are enjoying the atmosphere of a village-like restaurant tuck in the bukit timah hills, once a fire-station - you would just be glad for the great food and ambience. Their lunch and dinner menu looks great - until then, bon appetite

Visited Spruce at Phoenix Park, near Dempsey for a Sunday brunch. It has been many months since my last visit but it was pretty decent before.Even by 10.30am the place was busy with a nice hum to it. That's where the good stuff stopped I'm afraid. The table had dying flowers in rancid water on it, not the nicest of touches so they had to go for a start.A disappointing tale of lukewarm coffee, undercooked eggs, over cooked bacon, hard avocado and dishes arriving 5 minutes apart, followed. I have since heard that they have changed chefs; whether that explains a pretty mediocre affair I leave for others to decide. This was a shame as it is a good venue, particularly if you sit outside. I would avoid going indoors as it is all whitewashed breeze block walls, not the most inviting.Overall I would like to say that I enjoyed it as it is an excellent location slightly off the beaten track. However, whilst the service was attentive given how busy the place was, the food itself just wasn't up to it

Spruce is a delightful restaurant tucked away in a quiet corner of Phoenix Park. Nestled among lush greenery, Spruce is a nice hideaway from the hustle and bustle of modern day Singapore. Unfortunately, Spruce can be a little difficult to get to, especially if you do not have your own transport.There is very little to complain about the food - it is good, but not great. The portion served for the main course and overall prices are reasonable. They do have a small selection of wine and liquor to go along with your lunch/dinner selection. The must have items are the dessert, which I think is affordably priced and yummy. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant for people looking to have a quiet and relaxed meal in a soothing environment. The selling point for Spruce is definitely the ambience, more so than the quality of the food

been here twice now. love the atmosphere - although it is a bit crowded, it kind of suits the place. had a bit of a wait during one trip as we did not have a reservation, so I would recommend making one. the food is good, the the service is good. i'm not a fan of tuna burgers, but i must say, the one at spruce was good quite. i would recommend it - and the signature steak benny. its a must try
4
The coffee is good, service was attentive and good and the added bonus of a free scone, jam and cream was a nice touch. Lots of people there and a great atmosphere. Not sure what all the previous complaints are about. Worth a try I say. There is a nice vibe at this place

Sunday brunch. All staff totally in the weeds. Had the British breakfast which I could have made a better one at home. Flies on our cheese plate. Ordered drinks that never arrived
Won't be back. Shame

The burger with wild rocket is tasty and juicy. Truffle fries are a must try!

My wife and I went to Spruce for brunch on a recent Saturday morning with two friends (arrived around 10/10.30am). We did not have a reservation but did not need to wait and were seated at a table outside on the covered patio. Nice, relaxed atmosphere. I had the tuna burger, which was excellent. Another in our group had the eggs benedict (they have several eggs benedict specials) which looked very good. Overall good food and very nice atmosphere for brunch. Recommend going early as there was a line-up when we left

For some reason this place is completely PACKED for brunch. But that of course didn't stop me from coming back because there's something inherently attractive about this place - I put it down to atmosphere (extremely laid back, casual) because it's definitely not the food. The pancakes are average, eggs are blend, sausages oily, and the coffee was absolutely terrible! The other redeeming factor (other than atmosphere) is that it serves brunch till 4pm so it's great if you wake up at 3pm and realise your fridge is empty. however, if it's 3pm, you might as well go for the lunch menu which looks awesome
3
Located far from the city centre which is a pain to get to but it has a nice atmosphere as the place is decorated very modernly and finished with a beautiful decking area! The food is very average, nothing to write home about which was disappointing! Staff are efficient but not overly friendly - again the word average springs to mind! Its a little pricey for average food

Some friends made a reservation at Spruce as a "surprise" get-together for someone's birthday. It was a surprise alright - we got there and there was a queue. When we eventually got someone from front of house's attention (which in itself took like 5 min), we were told we had to wait even though we made a reservation. The person was rude and abrupt even though the restaurant dropped the ball. And of course, she promptly disappeared again and no one else came back to the front of house. Further, since there was already a large crowd waiting at the entrance already (some of them plonked on the floor around the front of house - they look like they've been there quite a while), I found it hard to believe her when she said it was a 10 minutes wait for the table. We left and took our business elsewhere and will never go back. The whole point of making a reservation is so that there is a table available at the time reserved. If the restaurant is not able / willing to keep a table open until the time reserved, then do not accept reservations. And obviously, the front of house needs to be manned by someone with people skills

We had visited Spruce several times over the past 8 or 9 months. From initially "very good" I must now downgrade it to "Average". The entire service crew apparently was changed and it shows, the typical personal, spontaneous and always excellent service is now mediocre. The food, despite the menu being the same or similar, is also no longer that exciting and fresh as it used to be. The location is still one of my favourites, seating outdoor gives you the feeling of being int he middle of the greenery away from the noise of the city

I was pleasantly surprised here to Find a Brilliant Restaurant tucked away at Phoenix Park in Singapore Given that its autumn its still very Hot but we found a cool leafy outdoor table, The service was pleasantly Good, Staff informative on Wine and Food Knowledge. Courses delivered timely at the right time, Finding this Gem in Singapore with service Food and Drinks all in due course is rare I commend this well run restaurant

My friend introduced us to this restaurant located near to where I live. Located in a quiet suburban area, it gives us a sense of relaxed, at home environment with nice foods. The owner was there to serve us with friendly manner, and helped us with lovely family dinner occasion. Just for a note: this place can be quite crowded on weekend brunch time. Also it may be hard to grab a taxi in the premise, so try to call up or catch at Tanglin road gate

My first time to come here and it is really and enjoyable place for a brunch, but off course very packed.They serve decent food at decent price.The tuna buger was very promising on the menu but a bit disappointing though.Tehy offer good desserts and cakes. They apparently also offer dinner BBQ on Tuesdays
