When here with friends under the recommendation of the front desk guy in our hotel. I was a gem, this restaurant would be our go to restaurant for our next visit to Singapore. I would recommend the mutton, it was glorious.

Air-con, clean, spacious place, with helpful staff; we ordered tandoori chicken masala, bhindi masala, kadai vegetable, pepper mutton, tangri kebab, biryani rice, tandoori roti. fish tika, and lime juice; had a hearty meal at less than $25 per person.
4
This restaurant is clean and air-conditioned. There is a wide variety of Indian and even Chinese cuisine. I recommend the Masala chicken and masala prawn dishes. The briyani rice is tasty. Many types of hot and cold beverages to choose from.

Visited with family with young kids.Place is easy to locate and convenient reach.Ambience is simple .... Usually typical of South Indian restaurants. It's comes from their culture... Very simple and down to earth beautiful souls..Hospitality is greatttt..... Very warm and kind... Again their cultural infusion....A good selection of cuisines and items on menu... Will surely find something or other to satisfy all varying taste buds...And food is real tasty... Loved the spice level as I'm a spicy guy...May need to inform in advance if need some customised spice levels.. Esp for kids.And it's big restaurant with ample covers.... Still almost full... That itself speaks of their food n quality.Overall acoustics may need improvement...But Great place for good meals anytime.... Enjoyed it thoroughly

Having been eating at Apollo Banana Leaf all my life, and given them chance after chance but they did not improve so not going back again, because service was terrible, became too touristy the fish head also tend to be overcooked because of the crowd and they stop the free flow of pappadums which it a must when you have curry.Found this place a few shops away and its was heaven send. Great atmosphere, nice, friendly and smiling service. Fish head cooked just right and most important free flow of pappadums. Sakunthala you be my go to place for my Fish Head from now on

Like some other Little India Indian restaurants, it's decorated like a coffee-shop but air-conditioned, with simple decor and spaced-out tables and seats.The maÃ®tre d' is a very pleasant host, and comes by to talk and to recommend us some dishes.We wanted to try the dum briyani, so we ordered 2 sets : chicken and mutton. However, he recommended us to order just 1 set, and to compliment the main set with 3 other dishes : chicken, fish and Chinese-style fried brocoli. Indeed a strange Indian restaurant with a Chinese twist, as others have mentioned here.My first time trying the dum briyani and it was good : fluffy and not oily. The mutton tasted good, but the fish was average. The chicken meat was not tender and too dry. The last dish brocoli was excellent.It was a weekday Thurs night and it wasn't that crowded. We also had ginger tea to finish our meal and had a hearty talk until closing time at about 10.30 pm

Was my husband's birthday today. N he was veg. So ordered veg biryani for him.. didnt taste nice.. i tried the mutton dum biryani. Sad to say the biryani itself was not hot, just slight warm, tasted stale. Not what i expected.. i believe when its served it must be hot, appear fresh and aromatic
3
Nice place to host friends for a meal. Which was exactly why I was there. Most memorable was the mutton and chicken biryani. The rice was super flavourful and the meats tender without them being oily The paper tosai was a tad disappointing as they were not that crispy or it was left out too long. The fish head curry was nice, the curry gravy was piquant and slightly creamy which made the dish very appetising. The fish was also just cooked and the flesh was firm.Those who are not fans of spice, this is the one for you.there were other dishes on the table were nice too but too much for that night.overall, place was very nice and food was no braine

This restaurant located in little India Singapore. Restaurant has a wide range of India food that make you satisfied . specially their mutton.

Sakunthala's Food Palace Located at 66 Race Course Road, This place was recommended by the locals and didn’t disappoint on taste or price. It’s a another race course Indian restaurant , with varieties of North and South Indian food and a touch of Chinese cuisine , which I find strange in a Indian restaurant. It’s not the cleanest place in town, but due to low to middle range budget the place gets very crowded with their local Indians. Service levels are good, but it can improve. The quality of food is tasty such as, the specialty of the house the curry fish head, also the Chicken Briyani. Would recommend this place for a must try if you are in the mood for Indian flavors

The restaurant was located walking distance from the MRT station. The dine in area was quite huge, modern and simple in look. One was quite surprised to find live seafood display shelves in an Indian restaurant, which was something commonly found in Chinese style Seafood restaurants. Interestingly there was Indian kitchen, as well as, Chinese kitchen in this restaurant. There was a open hot food counter, as well as, a live cooking station which was opened to other to watch.We were served complimentary appadam while waiting for the dishes to be served. We tried on a number of drinks. Badam Milk ($4.00)Milky and not too sweet.Fresh Lime Soda (Sweet) ($3.00)It was like carbonated lemonade.Lassi (Sweet) ($4.00)It tasted like yogurt drink.Fish Head Curry ($26/small, $30/ big)A whole anggoli fish head is semi-stewed in a rich thick orange curry with assorted vegetables such as okra and brinjal, and a generous helping of Indian spices and lemongrass. The final result is aromatic and fragrant with mellowed spiciness.The curry was first cooked in the Indian kitchen before handling over to the Chinese kitchen for touch up before serving. The fish meat was firm and tender, with tender cooked vegetables in the curry. The curry was not heavily spiced as traditional indian curry.Chilli Crab (S$40/ 800 grams)Live Srilankan cooked in sweet and spicy sauce.The dish was pretty similar to the usual chinese seafood restaurant, where the crab was covered with a rich spicy sweet sauce. The crab was pretty fresh and we could see that it was freshly taken from the display shelves.Mutton Biryani ($11.50)Basmati rice cooked with lamb, saffron and aromatic spices Although the piece of mutton was bony, the meat was quite tender, without strong gamey taste.Chicken Biryani ($10.50)Basmati rice cooked with chicken and selected spices The meat was tender and rich.Pepper Mutton (SGD $8)Sakuntalas SpecialityThe meat was pretty tender with texture similar to pulled pork. It was covered with a rich spicy paste which made it a must have with rice.Butter Chicken ($9.00)Boneless chicken pieces in a creamy tomatoes butter gravyIt was rich and creamy with tender pieces of meat in it.Tandoori Platter (Non-Veg) ($25.00)A combination of chicken, fish & prawn and slices of bread.It consisted of the following :Plain Naan (a la carte $3.00)White flour Indian bread baked in clay ovenKashmiri Naan (a la carte $4.20)Indian bread stuffed with dried fruits, nuts and baked in tandoorTandoori Jhinga (a la carte $18.00)Fresh prawn marinated and grilled in the tandoor ovenFish Tikka (a la carte $14.00)Cubes of fish marinated with exoctic spices, grilled in tandoor ovenChicken Tikka (a la carte $14.00)Boneless chicken nuggets, marinated in tandoori masala & yogurt, grilled in the tandoor ovenChickenChicken Malai Kebab (a la carte $14.00)Chicken marinated with cream and grilled in the clay ovenFish Malai Kebab (a la carte $14.00)Tender and creamy clay oven baked fish cubesThe grilled meat was tender and flavourful, while the bread was soft and fluffy.Meals ($4.50)White rice served with two vegetables, chicken gravy, rasam and buttermilkIt was served with fluffy white rice, vegetable dishes, and gravy, making it a simple and tasty meal.Biryani Rice ($3.00)Basmati rice cooked with saffron and aromatic spicesThe rice was fragrant and light.Don't forget to help yourself with some of the mouth refresher at the cashier, on the way out

So I went to Sakunthalas at Race Course Rd for lunch today and I ordered mutton briyani which is my usual order in that specific restaurant. But I found a warm in my curry which is extremely disgusting as I'm not sure how many more worms could have been in it. I complained to the staffs and they told me it was due to the weather as it was raining yesterday which made no sense?! And the manager said it might be the vegetables that might have contained the worms in it which clearly shows that they are not hygienic as they are meant to wash vegetables before cooking and to check if there is it's rotten. I have called the relevant department and complained and they are currently monitoring the restaurant. I would really advice people to check their food thoroughly as I can't really force anyone to not go there anymore. I honestly felt so disgusted and vomited as it's the worst experience I've ever been through since my last visit. So people be aware.

A friend who made his first visit to Singapore requested for spicy Indian food. We went as a party of 10, comprising of friends from Singapore, England, Canada and Sri Lanka. We started with a platter of mixed cuts with a sweet naan - the fish is lovely!We had the most amazing Dum Biriyani (we love the mutton) and the restaurant's signature dish - Spicy pepper mutton. The bru coffee is also delicious

After my disappointing last visit in year 2016, I ended up here again during the fasting month as a friend was giving us a treat.After this visit, I vowed to myself never to step in Race Course Sakunthala’s even if I am getting free food ( I am not sure how the Dunlop street sakunthalas is, but I have heard that it is way better).So we ordered one fish head curry, prawn sambal and mutton varuval. 1stly prices are not cheap. The concept is like some expensive coffee shop (not restaurant) with long tables and chairs , yellow lights etc.The price you pay is not justifiable at all. a few pieces of mutton costs you like $15 minimum. Same for prawns. The mutton was lousy. So hard. Prawn was just so so. Fish curry was the worst ever. It was so fishy and smelly. But frankly the fish meat itself seemed fresh so I do not know what went wrong. I did not want to complain well it was a treat right. But when my friend herself commented that the fish was smelly I could not help it. By then we were half way done. So we just left it. We complained to the waiter who mentioned that if we had told before they would have gotten a new bowl for us. The cashier told the same. They were least bothered about the quality of the food I guess. If they were, they would have asked more questions rather than just saying that ‘if you had told us that it is smelly we would have gotten you a new bowl’. Oh well. No way am I going to get back here again. It is just a tourist trap

Visited this place for the first time, with family. Ordered a mutton dum briyani, veg meals, Sambal fish, tomyam soup and a bowl of steamed rice. There was some rice left even after we had slightly more than what we usually have. We here is two adults and a child. Mutton was very soft in briyani. I consider myself a lover of tomyam soup and my spouse as briyani connoisseur and both of us felt our respective favorites were upto the mark. Service was good. Orders were taken through tablets. We could look at the images of menu and choose accordingly. The bill was $33. The price is about right for the place and food. I would recommend.

Cab driver suggested this restaurant and went in with little hope. But, food was really good and they serve unlimited portions of biriyani. Fish fry was good along with Tandoor items. Service time is good and restaurant is open till 3 AM or so. Good options for Vegetarians as well.
5
I've here first time and wow its nice experience. I love Indian food...so im crazy on it. The place always full and u will see many small group or families here. If u alone or just couple u can share table with other guest... the portion for me too big since i eat small portion...but the taste....really nice...its just like home style food... i know i will come bck again soon...yeayy

Now a days, all the Indian Restaurant on Racecourse Rd. are fully Air-coned, clean & modern look.Sakunthala has additional attraction e.g. Halal & has Chinese dish with live fish to chose from as well. As my in-law family all are Indian with vegetarian & meat eater we still able to enjoy each dishes here. I had a late lunch thus took light meal as Tandoori chicken, naan , fried bindi, cauliflower. As my expectation on Tandoori chicken was low since they all are always dry & tough. Well well, theirs weren't. It was moist & tender and sourness from yogurt was just right to make you mouth drool. Bindi was crunch and nice. Cauliflower wasn't what I expected, it was similar to Chinese sweet & sour texture rather than similar to how they prepared bindi. Naan could be bit fluffier & thicker. I can simply recommend Sakunthala with their dishes but I enjoyed this restaurant extra over with their services.
4
The Mutton Biryani is really good. No complaints. Service is also good. We had the naans, Gobi Manchurian, chicken tikka. Overall we had a really good meal. They were helpful in helping to organise waffle ice-cream as cake for our friend.
2
Went with a party of about 20 for a Sunday lunch.
Service was terrible.e.g. serving the curry 20 mins before any rice appeared.
Missed orders. Just chaotic.
For something similar but much more reliable try Apollo next door.
4
Loved their fish briyani and prawn briyani.Their fish curry with mango was fantastic too.Waiters were attentive and food was served soon.The only setback was drinks came way too later than food but they have plain water in a jug.Definately will come back
3
The good:
• Ample sitting place
• Air conditioned
• Toilet available
The not so good:
• Salty food
• Price of food not value for money
• Good to try, but not a must
5
Group of 19 all with individual bills with really good food and service it simply does get better, the price!
Enjoy your meal, we did!
4
Went to Sakunthala's again after 2 years and went home full and happy. Great choices for Indian food. We had Chicken Kadai, Chicken Tikka, Naan and Prata Bread as well as Brinjal and the veg of the day. All dishes were good and the staff friendly. The ambience might be lacking to some but for me it is a reason to return
5
Food was great and delicious while the cleanliness of the restaurant needs to improve a little. Overall was great, definitely recommended for people to try when in Little India. Price was in Mid-Range though. Food: 3.5 / 5 Cleanliness: 2.5 / 5 Service: 3 / 5 Environment: 3.5 / 5 Total: 12.5 / 20 (Recommended)

Decided to get into the spirit of Deepavalli & visited the restaurant after a many years on the eve evening at 6pmChose this restaurant over others because of the tradition of upholding the memory of their mother's cooking.Ordered a veg meal platter , with a recommended fish kolumbu and tandoori roti and a plain lassi for the 2 of us.The veg platter looked unappetising , tasted sour which I thought was its unique taste but on hindight may have gone stale. The fillet fish in the kolumbu (probably sutchi fish) was not totally cooked, curry seemed like a pour over from someone else's order of fish head curry gravy. The only saving grace was the tandoori roti which was superb. Had a tummy upset on the way home and the 2 of us visited the loo a couple of times . Think we were saved from a worse ordeal by the plain lassi and the white rice. If you are constipated visit here.

This restaurant's reputation proceeds itself, and it lives up to the hype. Located across the street from popular shopping spot Mustafa Centre, it's centrally located and has a large, air-conditioned dining area. The staff are friendly and attentive. The menu is extensive but not too difficult to navigate. The set meals are great or spend a bit more on the specialty dishes, or do both like my wife and I. The food is so good, we often fall into the 'eyes are bigger than the stomach' when ordering and walk out too stuffed
4
Good place to bring the family. With a variety of dishes that will suit your taste buds. Clean environment and friendly staff. Must try their masala dosa, fish head curry and the Indian desserts. Liked the masala tea and ginger tea too. Value for money. Will definitely visit again.
4
If you want good quality low budget food I strongly recommend the said resturant . Very friendly staff good service above all food is delicious and very budgeted in price.
4
We picked this place at random and were not disappointed. I loved the Kothu Roti and my wife enjoyed her Dosai. The only disappointing aspect was the weak chutney's, but we'll come back here again.
5
You know you've found a good restaurant when the locals are queueing outside. We had a heap of food with drinks for $35. We couldn't eat it all. Yum

Great food...
Great aroma...
Great prices...
Ony sad thing was dessert was unavailable due to a fault in the ice machine.....

This restaurant near the MRT station is easy to find with its huge sign. The place is spacious, clean, bright and well staffed. We ordered onion rawa masala, not on the menu and they cooked it without extra cost, a mean rawa thosai and mutton murtabak , all freshly made and served at the same time. We had 3 masala teas although cold water is served for free . What we liked best are the various sauces, which can be topped up for free - just wave to the attentive staff and they replenish without batting an eyelid. The bill was less than S$30, all included.Opens till 11 pm everyday including weekends. A convenient place to have a late dinner after exhausting oneself at the nearby Bugis and Orchard shopping area
4
If you are into Indian food - curries, chillies, unleavened bread, then you should give this restaurant chain a try. The one I recommend is next to Mustapa's Shopping Centre at Syed Alwi Road in Little India. Service is quick, food variety is more then adequate, price is very reasonable.Order a glass of plain warm water to wash down all the spices.

Recently toured Singapore and Sakunthala was our preferred go to restaurant for lunch and dinner for most of the days.. They have got a great variety of Indian vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes which are fabulous yet economical by Singapore cost standards.. Their prawn masala, fish curry, butter paper dosa and Mutton Murtabak are a must try.. We had the opportunity to try around 25~30 of their dishes over 5 days and Sakunthala never disappointed taste and service wise ..! It's so popular that the side walk beside the restaurant is also full to capacity even at 12 in the night.. The ambience though not very upmarket is still very welcoming with clean tables and chairs and cheerful and helpful waiters and staff..Will definitely visit again.

My family used to frequent the dunlop street branch many years ago. Over the years their standard has definitely dropped. But we chose to come to the Race course road branch for a surprise birthday dinner which we were doing for my cousin from overseas.It was a disappointment and we will not be coming back here again for sure especially that our relatives from overseas whom we were hosting commented that the food was just average.I personally went down to the restaurant to reserve for 15 pax a day before and specifically said that I wanted the last section , corner of the restaurant for seating. the cashier agreed.On the day of arrival, they were unable to give us the space we wanted. They gave excuses saying there is a bigger group and they have given that space to them. The manager seemed least interested to even speak with me when I asked him for help and got his staff to handle me. fine.And then I asked them for an additional table and the staff told me that the tables beside us are booked already. But when we counted they only gave us 3 tables = 12 pax. I had booked for 15 pax? My husband explained to the staff again and he gave us another table.So we started ordering. Food came in quite quickly and the restaurant was filling up real fast. The biryani was really sub standard. We could still taste the not fully cooked masala in the chicken biryani (we are Indians btw), prawn biryani tasted beta but you have to really fish for the prawns. e vegetarian Chinese mee goring was sweet. Drinks were good tho (especially the lime soda). Kothu prata was ok. So we came to a point where I wanted to bring the cake out and cut it. So I asked the staff to clear the table and then bring the cake.The staff brought the cake out after just clearing the plates and with many cups n tissues lying around on our table still ( So far in my previous episodes with other restaurants, they will ensure that the tables are fully cleaned before bringing the cake). I asked the cashier to play the birthday song and I could not even hear the song when my cousin cut the cake. Iwas really irritated by then. So we left the restaurant and went out for desserts to another place.Not a place to go to if you are looking for authentic south indian food and good service on a weekend (when it is packed).BTW, we chose Shakunthalas over Apollo banana leaf coz of the fact that Apollo is always very crowded and noisy and squeezy. After the dinner, I told myself at least we would have bad a better meal end of the day if we had dinner in Apollo. :
5
This is definitely one of the places where I had one of the best authentic Indian food in Singapore. I had curry fish head, garlic naan and biryani. While they were all extremely aromatic and fragrant, they tasted equally good as well. Portions were adequate and service staff were prompt. The best part was that the restaurant was fully air-conditioned, making eating spicy food in humid Singapore a painless and comfortable experience
4
First encounter with order made via an app on an iPad. How interesting and you will be able to obtain the breakdown of price. Had a set of banana leaf rice with three selection of vegetables plus a medium sized fish head curry, masala chicken, a basket of papadum and a plate of "ladies finger". The "ladies finger" tinged with chilli powder was done to perfection and highly recommended. Food was served in the shortest time and service was excellent. Enjoyed thoroughly.
4
Ive NEVER been dissapointed at Sakunthala's. You always leave satisfied and happy. The lunch plate is great as it comes with so many extra yummies.
5
i want to experience indian food and the taste is awesome
the portions is Big and the quality is good
4
Had supper with two of my friends.
We had naan, chicken bryani & chill sambal rice.
Total cost $36
Very affordable for a big and delicious portion.
Will definitely come again.
5
Serves fantastic indian food .Had some Naan's and Lamb curry was mind blowing.Loved the ambience and the taste.

we r there with our family few of the tables are a bit small ! their briyani is must try.they have an special "vattha kulambu" whis is an killer taste aswell........
..

Last time the fish head curry used to be very nice and tasty.On our visit tonight the fish head curry was very diluted and not enough spices and herbs. No love goes in to the curry.Malai kebab was very salty and over cooked. It should be soft and melt in the mouth.Tandoori chicken was a bit dry and not spicy enough. I think need to be marinated longer.The veg curry (brinjal and okra) was OK but a bit stingy on the portion.Cereal prawn was excellent.Palak paneer was good.Service was very fast and good. The place is very clean and nice air cond.
4
Every time my family & I are in Singapore, this restaurant is a must visit ! The taste & portions remained the same for years. Above average portions & very tasty - truly superb. So many dishes to choose from. When in doubt just go for the set meals. They have Chicken Set Meal, Prawns Set Meal, Vegetarian Set Meal plus several other choices. My personal favourite is the Lamb Set Meal. Each set comes complete with main dish together with white rice, a few selection of veg & potato side dishes plus a few choices of curry, rasam & yogurt gravy. Other popular choices include the Tandoori Chicken (available after 1pm only), Briyani rice, Kashmiri pilau & the popular Butter Chicken. Plenty of drinks & desserts to choose from as well. From Masala Tea to Kulfi to Ice Blended concoctions. The choice is yours.Only downside is the serious lack of space. One must be early to get a seat or just bear & grin it while waiting for others to finish their meals. But it's worth the wait. Logical spot to have your lunch, dinner or supper after serious shopping at Mustafa (just across the road).
4
Prawn biryani is my favourite dish in here, very superb. keep up the goodness and freshness in your recipe. This restaurant is always the best when comes to dining for lunch or dinner. But the staff needs to be trained on how to accommodate the people who comes to eat. Other than that, Good food value for money
4
Had the mutton masala biryani with chicken 65. The portions were huge and the biryani was delicious. The black pepper mutton was well flavoured and not too spicy. Chicken 65 was moderate sized portions, crispy on the outside and tender inside. The chicken was well marinated as well. Good food on the whole.
4
If you're in Little India and doing shopping in Mustafa Centre. Better get your food right here just next to mustafa centre you can get typical and tasty indian food with lots of varieties of food. I used to go right here with friends on weekends. Quite nearby from Ferrer Park MRT Station can reach by walk only.. :
5
We had dinner twice. Good food.. Nice Hospitality. Nice Waiter. On Mac Book you have to order and you will get what u ordered. CRABS lover can absolutely visit this restaurant...
5
For real Indian food, go here. Got it recommended by a local in Singapore. We weren't disappointed, the dishes are simply amazing.
4
Had company lunch here. Been here a few times and not disappointed at all with the food . Should try the fish head curry and the crispy lady finger dish. And of the sweet treats as well
5
Great place for India food
A and its open till 3am I think in weekends
Co we went for dinner well past midnight on a Saturday
3
Located just across Mustafa Shopping Mall in Syed Alwi Road. They serve Indian meal buffet where you can choose from the food display or have menu order. Place is strategic, easy to find, acceptable clean, typical Indian resto- busy, friendly staffs. Food are soooooo delicious. They have many varieties of menus. I had Chicken Briyani and ice lemon tea (they had in big glass). Meal size are big portion! make sure your stomach is very empty after shopping to have this big meal. Ask the waitress for menus suggestion, also the spicy levels
4
Visited for dinner with family, place was crowded, and that was one indication the food must be good. enjoyed it immensely. I choose a kottu parata and my wife a masala thosai. the food was severed fast and taste good.will stop by next time to try other options. They also accept credit card
2
If you want to try north Indian dishes in south Indian flavor this place will be right for you, we tried north Indian butter chicken dish which was served with south Indian Flavor. This restaurant is good for people who like south Indian food served on Banana leaf. Be careful before ordering any items that rates in menu at door and table are the same on IPAD.we brought this up to their attention and they came up with the excuse that our menu has to be updated. We really got attracted by the rate displayed in the menu on the front door. Not a nice experience
3
It was my birthday dinner with a friend. The service is "so-so" and the concept is to place your order over the ipd.The food was alright. The Chettinad fish a bit too hard and the fish meat stick to my teeth but the Fish Cutlet was juicy. The Garlic Naan was nice. However, too dried for the Butter Naan. The sauces was delicious, specially rasam. All and all was average. Will return to try the fish curry as seeing many orders
1
We use to go to this restaurant once a week every Fri or Sat night for dinner for months; but after this Friday the 21st of August, we might never go back as it was the worst experience. No one ever wants to be sick after eating at any restaurant.We ordered Masala Thosai, Mango Lassi, Tandoori Chicken, chapatis which are our usual orders, this Friday we also ordered Chicken Masala as well. We don't know what was off or bad but something was contaminated as with 2 hours of eating we were running to the toliet as we were having the runs. Our stomachaches were hurting so bad and we had 2 more episodes of running to the toliet that night.There is no other explanation. Either the water added to the lassi was bad or the ice used to make the lassi was contaminated and not proper or the chicken masala was off and still served. Whatever it was; it is not something that we will forget.It's rather sad as we do love going there for Masala Thosai and Mango Lassi as they are fair when it comes to their pricing and for a good meal it was a cosy restaurant where you could get fast service and a good indian meal in Little India which was not overpriced.I do hope that the management of Sakunthala will take action to ensure that hygiene is checked more thoroughly with the staff who work there as this could be the only cause of such a bad experience in a restaurant
1
Went to this restaurant with the whole family on recommendation of one of our Hotel staff. Lack of customer service was noticeable but we thought that good food would compensate for this. We ordered a variety of dishes including Samosas, Tandoori Chicken Masala, Biryani Rice, Lamb Vindaloo, Aloo Jeera along with some other sides.Chicken was cold in the middle and the rest of the family thought their dishes were well below the worst Indian Restaurant we have ever been to! If I didn't know any better I'd say we had heated up leftovers. Would not recommend this place at all.Very disappointing considering that we caught a taxi especially to this restaurant for a nice family meal.I did mention to the staff that the chicken was cold and very dry, like old chicken and they said okay, would I like to have it heated up !! Too dangerous with chicken and too bad . I wonder who is leaving all the great reviews for this restaurant online or if we just got leftovers. Too bad
5
Now it's became one of my favourite restaurant . I went there with my wife last night . We tried the fish briyani and chic briyani . The food was fabulous but the drinks are quite expensive. Highly recommended for an authentic Indian cuisine lovers❤️
5
This was an excellent dinner that I had after checking out the Mustafa Centre. I went ahead and order the variety (5 different curries) deal and was pleased with everything on my plate.
4
We were only Westerners in a packed spot that delivered excellent food, very good service in a clean, bright spot across from Mustafa Center. Poori, Naan, Chicken Tandoori masala and Mutton Rogan Josh were sure fire ( and I mean "fire") choices. Spicy and flavorful but worth every bite
4
We ordered Chicken briyani, butter chicken with plain naan and mutton naan. The food was delicious. This place is halal certified by MUIS. Food was served quite fast but I find the price is a bit on the high side. The place is clean and just next to 24 hour Mustafa Centre. So convenient
5
Recommended by our Uber Driver and he was right! We had lunch there, the Vegetarian set and for me the Mutton Briyani, and I have to say it's one of the best Indian food I have ever experienced! Highly recommended! And we will share this to our friends and family! Definitely I will be back! Thanks Guys!

We always make a point of visiting this restaurant when we go to little India.It is basic down to earth place with out any frills but it is clean and the food is good.and reasonably priced.There is a wide variety of food and vegetarians are well catered for,the portions are good and the food arives quickly.The place gets very packed and noisy,but you dont feel rushed,there is also some seating outside.It is well worth a visit for a quick bite when you are shopping or for something more filling if you are spending some time exploring the area
4
If ambiance is what you are looking for, this is not the place, however, if very good India food, good service and very reasonable prices is what you are in search of, then this is the place.Lots of variety, vegetarian, spicy, real spicy , mild, all available, a must try is their Fish Curry
3
Been here tones of time as this place is one of the most popular Indian cuisine joint for any Locals and proximity to Mustapha Centre which is the only 24 hours shopping centre in Spore. This restaurant is probably one of hundreds of well running establishment in Little India which do not give two hoods about review online or Trip Advisor. That's makes the consumer at their mercy. Nothing really disastrous about them but I would say they are cocky with their supreme taste in food which in return gives them handsome revenue. But other areas except food is seriously mundane from the ambience, presentation, service and price point. That's all. Have a supreme taste spicy Indian food without any other expectation

We asked the locals where to go for a great lunch, well this is the place they all send us too. Food came quick and was warm. Mutton was spicy as I wanted it to be. Chicken biryani was not as spicy, but still good. The tea afterwards was part of the meal.

Has lunch with my family for first time here. I should said we have a bad choice of choosing to eat here. We a order a dam mutton brayani come with a chunk of bone with no meat at all, the papadom was hard n cold not crispy. Curry fish head vegetable especially the lady finger was old n you couldn't chew. Furthermore prawn , keema , naan all look pathetic . Wouldn't come again for sure.

We ordered fish head curry, mutton briyani, chicken briyani and butter chicken with plain naan. Everything was delicious. The place is halal certified by MUIS. Food was served quite fast and the price is quite affordable. The place is clean and has many seatings.

Went with two friend of which one is a local and he recommended it. Biryani was great and so was the mutton. Great mango lassi too. Not expensive

Eat-in at Sakunthala's is generally good. This last week I decided to do a take-away. I asked for a fish briyani and mutton briyani. The fish in the fish briyani is usually well cooked and will be moist. But the fish that came with my briyani was a fried fish , hard and cold. The mutton briyani...The briyani was soaked in the oil from the mutton gravy and I got to throw away half the rice. It cost me $20 for both the briyani. Felt very cheated by the quality.

We were staying on Orchard Road but came to know from friends that here we must try Fish Head Curry. I must say that it was really a great experience. We did not dine here but a Masala Dosai here and it was crispy and very delicious. Then we took take away parcels.They gave a big round plastic box and it was almost a full fish less its tail. It is enough for 2 persons. The curry is aromatic and contains eggplant, tomato and lime slices. It is spicy and very different from other fish curries. Little tangy due to floating lime slices but awesome. Try it with steamed rice. The big fish is large enough and fresh. Good quantity of meat in it.It is spicy so keep your cold drink or cold coconut water ready to wash it down

The food here is good, lots of choices. But it is busy and noisy. We had the crab biryani and roti prata. It comes with rice and sauce (maybe naan too?). It is very filling. The crab biryani was too spicy for me. Husband ate most of it. The roti prata was delicious: very buttery and hot/fresh. Instead of standard curry sauce, it came with a different kind of sauce, I don't remember parts of the meal. The wait staff are attentive and even efficient. Too much at times. The noise level comes from the customers as much as the staff. Lots of shouting, so this is not the place for a quiet romantic meal. You have to share a table with people

My wife and I had our Dinner there on Christmas Eve. We ordered Chicken Masala, Potato & Peas, Fish Cutlets and plain Naan. The Chicken Masala was good. The gravy was tasty and a little spicy hot. May not be suitable for children. But we like spicy food so it was good for us. Potato & Peas came with nice mild gravy - goes well with naan. The potatoes were soft and perfectly cooked. However we found the peas still a little hard. Fish Cutlets were nicely done. crispy on the outside and soft inside. Unfortunately it tasted more like potato cultlet - could not taste fish in it. We would prefer it with a little more fish meat in it. The plain Naan was a disappointment. It was quite flat and not fluffy at all. Overall it was an above average meal at a reasonable price

- Wide variety of food and cuisine- Very filling- Fair prices- Very comfortable seating- Good, friendly and attentive serviceTaste:- We had Briyani (South Indian style) and also some North Indian dishes and drinks such as lassi.- Everything tasted good.But:- Noting stood out- I get the impression that in their quest to include a wide choice spanning different cuisines, they dont specialise in any one particular kind of food. Hence, they are jack of many cuisines but master of none.- Indian cuisine is meant to tickle your taste buds but the key ingredient here seems to be moderation, hence you might not get the notes of spiciness.This place is good to bring guests who are conservative in food choices and want a safe choice

V wanted to try this restaurant for a change but it was not a very gr8 foodie experience !!!Starters like manchurian and tandoori fish was omg soggy inOil !! And I don knw wen it was made!!! Naan was even horrible !! It was jus right out of freezer and was not wort it to be called naan!!! And shahi paneer wasAnother disaster!!!

We went here as a group of five friends. With the help of the staff we were able to order different dishes. One person was not able to take too spice food, so she missed out on some of our delicious variety of dishes that we others enjoyed so much. This restaurant always fills up very quickly during meal times. As we got up and readied ourselves to leave we realized that others were already waiting to take our table. No wonder with such good food, and an efficient staff their servers and cooks do so well. We truly enjoyed our dinner with lots of laughter

Went there a couple of weeks ago on the recommendation of a friend. The food was pretty average and the service nothing special either. Not the worst place to go to but there are certainly better places a stone's throw away.
Pretty disappointing overall.

The black pepper mutton is excellent. Chep underrated place with good stuff to eat inhouse or to take away. Very close to mustafa center, so ideal for bringing home some indian food after shopping

Mango lassi, lime juice, sugar cane juice and more were a welcome treat in the Singaporean humidity and I was so pleased to be able to communicate with the waiter in my smattering of Indian.We ate the best chana masala and dal makhani I have eaten anywhere with naan and roti made right in front of us.Yum, yum, yum, you have to go here for cheap authentic Indian, you really have to :-

On the first day of the trip, we walked all the way from Beach Road to Little India for Indian Food.As one of us wanted non-vegetarian, we opted for Sakunthala's.The ambience was OK, food was also OK, though not on the best side, definitely not on the bad side. Rava dosa (Thosai) was good but little oily. Chutney was awesome. South Indian meals disappointed us as it was not on the best side

the one i went was the race course area. The lamb biriyani was great .we had number of dishes the prawn masala, mutton masala, chichen curry with garlic nun bread was also great..the service was great too.nice ambience. Pricing a bit high ,depends on what you choose.Overall food was good. Keep it up

Since I'm staying very near Chinatown I wanted some thing different for lunch so took a trip uptown to walk around a bit and get some good Indian food. Most of the stalls on Dunlop Street look the same, but the menu at Sakunthala's looked good, the main restaurant had great reviews and a friendly hostess came out to greet me. The restaurant was also mostly full, despite it being nearly 2pm so took that as a good sign.It wasn't. I had a simple order of Chicken Masala, yellow rice and a diet coke. What I got was an enormous plate of yellow rice (a platter, really) that I'm not sure four people could finish (with a whole egg in the middle), and a very small dish (bread plate size) of about 6 small pieces of chicken in a dark brown sauce - not a Masala sauce.Since this was only lunch thought I would try it anyway. The chicken was mostly bones and bone pieces, it was cold and also contained a lot of gristle. Ugh.I asked the waiter to replace it with what I ordered but he said it was 'fine'. I said it was cold and he again said it was fine and that it was late for lunch. I asked for the bill and it said chicken biryani, with two orders of bread (instead of the rice) which is not what I ordered. Still could not get them to correct the bill.I paid and left, had a snack a short time later at a much better restaurant not too far away. Overall, very disappointing. Too many other places to eat in that area to put up with cold food, bad food, and not great service.Note: I was chatting with the owner of another restaurant and he pointed out that since it was late in the day, I likely got whatever was left in the bottom of the vat. Good point... Definitely won't go back there

Been to this restaurant a couple times and have tried the famous Fish Head curry.Served on a traditional Banana Leaf was very good service, quick and easy to order. Great cleanliness inside and the price is just right to suit a reasonable budget for the quality and cuisine. This restaurant is very much for those who are familiar with Indian food. Perfect to satisfy your hunger and cravings. Order, eat and Go I would not visit for a special occasion

Must go and try this awesome fish head curry. The fish was super tender and the curry was just perfect with all the ingredients mixed together. You do not even need to worry if it is spicy because it is not. Yet u will never get enough of it!! So dont forget to try!! It cost SGD24 for a huge pot or an even bigger one for SGD30. Standard rice is Sgd2 per person.

I had been to the restaurant twice, once with the coupon to try out the curry fish head at discounted price, another time is the team dinner and only then i know they are Halal.Curry fish head tasted quite good for my 1st time. My 2nd time experience we had their Indian food like curry, Gobi, naan, tandoori chicken, etc. Food tasted good for me as Chinese, I especially love the Gobi except for some certain items like one of the curry chicken. They use the tandoori chicken and added on the curry so it is kind of having another round of the same food. However, my Indian colleagues they don't really feel good. 1st they said it is not authentic north Indian cuisines anymore, it actually blended into local so it has more local taste

Service was good. We made appointment to dine in this restaurant for 6 persons, and my hubby and I reached We went in first and waited quite long for our friends but the staffs did not show any sign of impatience, unlike staffs of some other restaurants. The staffs even joked with us and made us feel comfortable. Food wise was nice especially the curry fish head. We had also ordered their bryani rice and Naans, all were very yummy and the price were also reasonable for the portion they served. The bryani and curry fish head make me feel like going back again to try. The deep fried lady finger is also another nice dish which one can eat as finger food. Overall experience was good and hope they keep it up with the good service and nice food. Only one thing, parking is hard to find but you can park at the multi carpark behind

The food was good and had quite a bit of variety including the vegetarian dishes. I tried the Biryani which was nice though not the best that I have eaten.

Good, spicy quality foods are being served here. Service staffs are also friendly, polite. We can try good spicy seafoods here. only one drawback is seats are limited compared to the rush in peak hours. But you can make online table reservations in their webpage.

I frequent sakunthalas about thrice or more a month! Worth the money and realllly good food. Gotta try the pepper chicken and fish curry.. Staff are pretty friendly as well!

This restaurant, like the Banana Leaf Apolo nearby, features Chettinad cuisine from southern India. While the food is decent and the decor is a slight improvement, overall this is a pale imitation, with the Chicken Masala here failing badly in comparison.

If there's one thing u shouldn't miss at this restaurant it's definitely Mutton pepper fry. It's the best. There r many other restaurants serving this particular dish but none tastes better sakunthala. I travel to singapore frequently and I make sure I visit sakunthala at least once. Other than mutton pepper fry, u should also try the fish thali. That's also very nice.

We ate at the location on Dunlop street twice. Less touristy and even though they have the same menu as the other location on race course dr, prices were slightly cheaper at this location. Delicious food, my husband LOVED the masala crab. The Thosai, chapati, and roti were very good as well. Great value, authentic food, must try
4
I have dined here at least a dozen times over the last few years. It is my favorite Indian in Singapore, right in the heart of Singapore's Little India (directly opposite Mustafas Shopping Centre). I just had a 24 hour stopover in Singapore and headed straight to Sakunthala's. Great food, clean restaurant and fantastic value. Delicious Roti and curry sauce and Tandoori chicken for about S$8

Generally we all know Indian food are rather pricey because of all the spices used. We came here twice because I bought the Fish head curry voucher for $18. We added rice, drinks and a few more dishes for extra $25. Thats for 4 people so its quite cheap. Have had better fish head curry but different restaurant serves different style of curry. Here its more citrusy with lemon slices cooked in

Food lovers who want a taste of Indian Food should not miss out going to Sakunthal's Food Palace. The ambience of the restaurant creates a cosy setting to chit chat after a long day be it shopping or work anyday any time. It also can be a spot for business meetings weekdays afternoon as the place is pretty crowded by dinner. Staff are attentive and will be ever willing to suggest dishes that can tantalise your tastebuds. The restaurants has both pre prepared meal which you can choose from or food that can be cooked once you place your order. The food is really Good, do give it a try

Had a fabulous lunch at the Dunlop street location. In spite of our language challenge our server was able to convey his recommendations which proved to be excellent. Complete meal was very inexpensive and most likely the best Indian meal we ever had. This is a local restaurant so be prepared for rustic surroundings and be surrounded by locals. Canâ€™t wait to return
