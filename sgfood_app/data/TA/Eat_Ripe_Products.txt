While in Little India, shopping or taking in the sounds & aromas of India in ample measure, this Fresh Fruit Juice stall stands out in sweltering hot Singapore! Ask for any blends of pineapple, Apple, orange, banana, water melon or coconut water, you will get served with a smile in this otherwise no-nonsense place. Have been here several times over the years and find the fruits always fresh! Do try it next time you are in Little India
