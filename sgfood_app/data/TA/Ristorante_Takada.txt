Had the Christmas menu and I must say the taste and quantity was just right for me. However, it does get a bit noisy when the place gets filled. Other than that, good experience.

Great food but service can be improved. Waiter was unattentive and slow to respond. Had to be asked twice for everything including menus, utensils and napkins.

Celebrated my cousin‚Äôs 30th birthday here. Standout dishes were the uni pasta and miyazaki beef. Chestnut montblanc was a terrific end to the meal!

The tenderloin is 80gram for 88 bucks. Didn't order that. Ala care also very small portion. Quiet and nobody else is there. Won't return

Went to Ristorante Takada this afternoon for our half-anniversary, since we had a Chope voucher to use up.We had the 4-course Omakase lunch. Pictured1) Amuse Bouche and bread2) Mushroom cappuccino3) Burrata and Parma Ham4) sea urchin and squid ink pasta5) cabbage wrapped braised veal main (for him)6) wagyu steak main (for me)7) dessertWe had relatively high expectations since we knew the chef had previously been at Arossa. While the lunch was not was disappointing, it was also not mind blowing. I really liked the sea urchin pasta - it was full of umami. The mushroom cappuccino was interesting in concept but fell short in execution. The braised veal was blah but the wagyu was amazing. Overall: not really quite sure I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll come here again, unless I get another voucher or discount

Bread was warm but very stingy with olive oil and balsamic. All the food were lukewarm and the mushroom starter with Onsen egg was cold. Uni pasta was a letdown and the Uni was smelly. A5 Wagyu Beef was not cut properly and it was chewy with a lot of fibre. Dessert was not the best combo with basil foam overpowering the strawberry and it tasted weird with the panna cotta right below. With all the supplement a 4 course lunch would cost around $110 per pax with taxes. At this price, I have tasted way better quality. Even Buona Terra is much better.

Went for my husband birthday and it was only the 2 of us. The restaurant checked on preferences and his name for desert and they special baked lave cakes he was craving. Got confirmation after hours and super quickly. Service was impeccable and food original without being out there. Chef Takada checked on us. Highly recommended, it's a hidden gem. The Takada team deserves your visit and dollars. Worth the trip to Alexandra road

My friends and I have been to Restorante Takada many times, never failed to be amazed by the food quality and excellent service. The squid ink pasta and mushroom cappuccino soup is out of this world! Main course is always something different to look out for, juicy beef or fresh seafood. Leave the best surprise to desert for a happy ending to the meal:

This is the sort of place you want to keep to yourself so as not to spoil your secret little go to Italian. We had two lunches here in a week as the food really impressed us.From the August menu, we'd highly recommend:1. Japanese squid with lardo 2. Conger eel tempura with corn fritters3. Sakura ebi pasta4. Pasta with Uni and squid ink5. Chocolate terrine6. Gelato - strawberry, yoghurt, chocolate and vanilla.The lunch menu is really good value. Service is attentive and enthusiastic.
5
Chef Takada does wonderful things with his seasonal ingredients like amazing Wagyu A5 beef, and fresh fish from Tsukiji Market. Even dessert was superlative - those canales!! Lovely cosy restaurant with excellent and friendly service.For dinner, only a set dinner menu or omakase. Lunch has a la carte options.Parking available at the Alexis condominium where the restaurant is located
5
Had an absolutely fantastic dinner, tried the 5 course meal. For the food quality and dining experience against price, definitely worth the price paid. Only cons is that they only serve beer and wine!
3
Went for the Omakase. Uni pasta was the most memorable, the rest were mediocre. Portion was rather small.

Advice to make reservation in advance to avoid disappointment.
If you do not know what to order, you may try the omakase menu.
Value for money and you will get to try the variety of their starter.
Friendly casual ambience with cheerful service staff
5
Dinner was excellent with very considerate and attentive service. Staff were very accommodating with switches in the menu.

Will come back and hoped they have more menu sets to choose from in future .
Overall the menu is appetizing and very Family orientated . Thanks üôèüèª

Very good value for lunch. Food was very good and presentation was pretty. We like it so much that we are going to do our annual new year's luncheon there with 20 other friends!
5
Perfect!! And very unexpected. Unpretentious setting, fantastic service and food creation is beautiful and taste amazingly nice.

The best risotto I've had! This is a hidden gem literally as it's set in the middle of the automotive and¬† residential¬† district of Alexandra (ample parking!). Very good value for money set lunch as you get a 3 part starter + 1 pasta + 1 main + 1 desert + tea/coffee for just $48++ (so it's actually 6 courses for what is published as a 4 course meal on the menu). Food: - ¬†the burratta starter was an interesting delight. - the risotto was awesome (the saffron risotto that came with the osso buco) .¬† - Perfect pasta.¬† Although everyone raves abt the sea urchin pasta, the slipper lobster pasta is¬† just as good if not better.¬†- Seafood soup main was v good , so don't feel compelled to order the ( v generous serving of) veal... though you should¬† order the veal just to get to the risotto! - ¬† I don't like tiramisu but I can tell theirs is really good ( there's a creme brulee alternative). Alot of food. Definitely not the usual simple Italian. The mark of a good Italian chef is in the pasta and risotto and chef Takada nailed both

I had a family celebration lunch there. We called ahead to book for a large group and informed the restaurant of food allergies as we had several members with food allergies. I am allergic to dairy. While they promised to provide alternative dishes for the members for allergies, even though they said the dishes I was getting was dairy free it turned out not to be the case. I was given a scallop with saffron cream sauce, and the pasta dish also had a sauce that tasted it had cream in it. As a result, I had tummy upset after the meal while in the restaurant and had diarrhoea again when I went home. When we informed them all they said was "sorry"! What if the allergy was more severe

Singapore is, perhaps, the best food in Asia due to its ethnic diversity, discriminating diners, and strict hygiene laws. Ristorante Takada was an amazing experience. The restaurant is tiny, perhaps seating 20 people, so make reservations. The prix fix meal has several choices with upgrades, which is fine. I had the delicious scallops, lobster pasta, and tiramisu. The server did this cool thing with ricotta cheese and dry ice that she topped the tiramisu with. Showy but delicious! Highly recommend this gem while visiting Singapore. The chef/owner and I are pictured here

The food was excellent, the service was very good and warm. Although we did have to wait for a dish the waiting was rewarded with the amazing food and caring service
5
We had Omakase 4 course and 5 course set lunch (68++ & $88++)
Quality food with reasonable price and with fine dining presentation
The portion of food is generous
Friendly service
Advice to make reservation in advance

Went for lunch, very worth it! Excellent presentation and delicious. The uni-ikura dish was especially yummy. The pasta is a fairly big portion so you will come out full! Will come again.

My wife and I went for lunch today. The food was delicious... Italian with Japanese flair. The service was impeccable and Chef Takada was friendly and took personal interest in our meal. This restaurant has tremendous potential and we recommend it highly.
5
It was our first time there to celebrate a birthday. We discovered a delightful restaurant with service, food and ambience that also speaks of value and quality. It is also a place for someone to dine alone comfortably.

value for money set offered. service staff very proactive and professional. executive chef will personally thank you and send you off.
5
The service was impeccable - from the service staff to Chef Takada, all were so warm and welcoming. Needless to say, we were not disappointed at all as the food was excellent!

Ristorante Takada has a special 2 week menu that‚Äôs promoting fresh produce from Nijgata prefecture. Niigata prefecture is famous for their rice and seafood. The rice is also used to brew sake and there are quite a few famous sake breweries. The featured items in this menu include edible chrysanthemum flowers, fruits, seafood and even wine from Niigata!I settled in for a special 5 course meal in this Italian restaurant that uses premium Japanese ingredients in their food.Here are the highlights of my meal:We started off with Antipasti Freddi: - Tartare of Japanese amberjack with olive soil: Diced amberjack fish with dehydrated olive oil ‚Äòsoil‚Äô atop it, with a shoot appearing to ‚Äògrow out of it‚Äô. The tartare and 'soil' were good. Loved this.- Marinated botan prawn with Niitaka pear: Presented like an ebi sushi. I had thought the white cube below was a piece of daikon. Only later did I realise that it was a pear! Nice.- Flat fish and edible chrysanthemum Kakinomoto Mille-feuille: Looks like a steamed ‚Äòhar gau‚Äô (Steamed Chinese prawn dumpling), but its was actually thinly-sliced flat fish sashimi wrapped around edible Kakinomoto chrysanthemum petals. Oishii!Next up was Antipasti Caldi. Loved the presentation, where it‚Äôs like art on a plate! There were: - Fritto sper squid with black aioli sauce: Squid was not fleshy, compared to the calamari that we are used to.- Oven-baked turban shell in garlic butter: The turban shell had a good bite to it. The ones here are from the Sea of Japan, where the shellfish are bigger and meaty, thanks to the currents there. Cut a slice and dip into the blob of squid ink... Umami and delicious! This was followed by the Primo - Risotto with snow crab Kensayaki style, topped with Koshihikari rice red miso paste and ginger foam. There was diced daikon folded into the risotto before playing and then torched. Topped with red miso paste and ginger foam, before the 'lobster-bisque'-like Japanese crab soup was poured into the bowl. Good!Fish was next. We were served the Secondo, which had:- Roasted goose fish lardellato - The star of this dish. Meat was fresh, firm and tasty. Couldn't get enough of it.- Saut√©ed blackthroat sea perch - Nicely pan-fried with crispy skin. Yum!Molecular dessert - Okesa persimmon tiramisu. Espresso-soaked ladyfingers, with a slice of light and airy topping of mascarpone cheese and egg yolks. Topped with diced Niigata persimmon. Table-side, the chef whipped up 'molecular' cream, by pouring cream into a bowl of liquid nitrogen and then bashing it with a whisk, resulting in a popcorn like bits, which they serve over the tiramisu slice. Eat fast, cos the cream will melt within a minute or so, once they warm to room temperature.To pair with the food, we had two wines and an aperitif:- Aperitif: Love&Plum - Plum wine, Shirone Niigata Japan: This is a bubby wine. Personally, I much prefer the usual umeshu, which is sweeter than this plum wine. - Sauvignon Blanc 2015, L‚Äôescargot: Light on the palate. - Yashiko 2014 Muscat Bailey A, L‚Äôescargot: This was my favorite of the lot. The aroma packs a punch, and I picked up kyoho grapes in the aroma. The wine was more mellow on the palate. What I like about this restaurant is the use of fresh Japanese ingredients done in a different cuisine (Italian), as most times, chefs will stick to ingredients sourced from the country where their cuisine originated from.A good meal, with the use of fresh ingredients and prepared well by a chef who knows how to bring out the best of each ingredient without the use of too mush sauces and flavorings

Nestled in a condominium, it caught my attention and I was handsomely rewarded by impeccable service and quality italian-japanese food! kudos to the chef!

This was an interesting modern interpretation of Italian food. The owner and chef Takada San takes pride in his offerings of two degustation menu's. Without doubt his Japanese heritage plays through in the choice of ingredients and in some instances the preparation. Well worth trying

Between my partner & I, we took a 108 per person set and a 148 per person set. We had the good fortune of discovering this cosy hidden gem nestled in Alexis condominium and we found everything fabulous here. Everything we had was delicately crafted Italian Style Cooking with fresh Japanese ingredients. And we were lucky that when we dined, we arrived as the only patrons here. I think it was only when we were 3/4 through our meal that, we were joined by another couple. The appetizer for the more expensive set was called "tuna & avocado tartar with Hokkaido Vegetable". Well, the dish turned out to be more impressive than its description. The tuna & avocado tartar were served in a flower pot designed to look like a potted plant, which was surrounded by Hokkaido Vegetables of 3 different colours. Once my spoon dug into the "soil", cubes of tuna sashimi mixed with green avocado were revealed. This was a perfect contrast in taste, texture and colour! The presentation of the burrata cheese & Parma ham was no less appealing. Served on a granite coloured plate, the presentation together with the multi colored Hokkaido Vegetables was a fireworks of colours and a treat for the eyes as well.Next, while I had squid stuffed with seafood flavoured couscous, my partner had Hamo Fritto ... essentially a fried fish dish. Both were served with white asparagus.Then we were served Hokkaido Uni Pasta ... essentially a lump of sphagetti toppped with sea urchin. Served with squid ink sauce, this sauce was separately contained so that we could decide on the amount to use. The Horseradish sauce that accompanied the A5-marbled Kagoshima Wagyu Tenderloin Steak was out of the world and simply exquisite. Risotto Foie-gras with Mango bubble was also interesting. The mango bubble was a small cube of mango sitting under a dome of foam.Roasted French quail with Intingolo sauce was a miniature lava egg! I thought this must have taken a lot of trial and error, as the egg unless a chicken egg was so small.I was so anxious that the fish would be overcooked, but to our delight, the Sauteed Seabass with Saffron cream didn't disappoint as well as the cooking was timed perfectly. The lamp shade was also unique, as it created a fascinating pattern of lights on the ceiling. Overall, we felt that everything was so intricately presented and prepared with so much passion and finesse, that it was a celebration for both the eyes and the taste buds.To crown our dining experience here, at the end of our meal, the chef himself graciously honoured us by coming out to greet and to thank us. We couldn't have hoped for a more beautiful meal

This restaurant is situated in the shophouses along Alexandra road opposite the BMW showrooms. Small interiors with maximum sitting of 24 pax. We tried the set lunch menus of both three and four courses set. We had tartar of Tuna with Avocado, white asparagus with octopus. The tatgliolini pepperoncino with Hokkaido sea urchin (very good!). Mains of Iberico Pork low temp cooked and Wagyu beef cheek very well done. Desserts of tiramisu and Creme br√ªl√©e delicious. Strong recommendation for couples or small private dinin

My friend took me to have lunch together since visiting Singapore on weekend. I was really impressed the quality of food. It makes me feel having real Italian food in Singapore. Cleanliness is also perfect. Very simple decor and make me feel extremely comfortable. It reminds me feel like home as well. Service is tip top and very efficient by details focus staffs. Materials they are using also selected great choice of quality. Thank you so much for unforgettable and memorable experience for all the fantastic staffs and chef Takada. Looking forward dining in again when I visited Singapore near future soon

My 4th trip here, each has been perfect- and today was no different. I personally love the ambience of cosy intimate restaurants to the larger overly noisy/brightly lit ones, and this place has gotten it just right. Service is good, quick and unobtrusive. The real star is the food - fresh produce, insanely well prepared and each dish is very different from the next. We did the Omakase lunch at 68+ plus a glass of wine- total came to 100 which was excellent value for a starter of burrata, parma and fish carpaccio, quail with foie gras, taglioni with uni, braised beef cheek with mash, and a perfect end with coffee/tea, some petit fours, and a fruit salad (which included an awesome tangy lemon sorbet, slice of dense choc cake and a macaroon). Kudos to the chef.

I always prefer small cosy/intimate restaurants helmed by the chef/owner who personally supervises the produce of the day and oversees the cooking of every dish.Chef Takada does just that and turns out well prepared and flavoured dishes using a minimum of sauces and letting the quality of the produce speak for itself.The restaurant week lunch lunch price is exceptionally cheap. $25 gets you the basic 3 course with hamachi, a very decent choice of mains including a generous Iberia pork dish and largish desserts. I don't think you can get a better value meal with the food quality, sit down ambience and service anywhere in Singapore!This gets my vote and is another restaurant that I certainly will return to after Restaurant Week.+ The chef himself came out to check on how everything was. Very decent wine list.-- Wine price markups a little high but you can buy-one-and-bring-one with corkage waiver
5
I tried the omakase lunch menu to get a sense of chef Takada's interpretation of Italian cuisine. I must say I was pleased with the result. Flavours were nuanced and balanced - Italian food that makes you pause and appreciate the subtlety of what you are eating. Your taste buds will not be hijacked by an excess of olive oil, garlic or cheese. Will definitely come again

We visited on a Tuesday nite. It's small, cosy n modern feel. There was a good crowd. Staff were friendly n knowledgeable. Here, it's Italian helmed by a Japanese chef Takada-San. 2 degustation menus were available. We selected the $128 menu. Quality was good n portion well thought out. Our dinner began with cappuccino of carrot soup. Starter was Burata cheese/Parma ham n a side salad. Followed by Hokkaido scallop, white asparagus, both key ingredients very tender. Next was a Chef Takada-san's signature - squid ink tagliolini peperoncino wif Hokkaido uni. So good, that we ordered an a la carte to share!! Meat course was Chef Takada-san's Kagoshima Wagyu steak, perfectly medium-rare, served wif asparagus, n a yummy eggy-cheese souffl√©/tart (?). Again, portion was good. Too big a piece, n you won't b able to enjoy d next pasta dish- we picked Sakura ebi n tomatoes. Again, the dish was well executed. We ended the meal on a sweet note of petit fours n tiramisu. Nothing fancy, but I always luv tiramisu with a good dose of expresso Some dishes offered a choice eg Wagyu steak or beef cheek, Sakura ebi/tomatoes or Parma ham/tomatoes. It was a pleasant experience. But serving time in between courses can be a bit long, or maybe we were just hungry!!

Ristorante Takada had come highly recommended, so my expectations were high. The food was excellent - difficult to find fault in the quality, presentation or taste. The service and the reservation procedure however left a lot to be desired. We booked online, where we were made to pay a deposit. However when we turned up at the restaurant, they had no record of our reservation, let alone our deposit. Fifteen minutes of back and forth ensued before they found our reservation and agreed to deduct the deposit from our bill. Service was also, initially, very poor. Despite the restaurant being almost empty when we arrived, and there being waiting staff around, we had to ask for a drink menu, and then again ask to give our order. It was as if the waiter was trying to avoid us. Once the drinks and food started arriving the service from the other staff was gracious. The restaurant did lack a bit of atmosphere - it felt like it needed a good maitre d' to pull everything together. If it sorted out these front of house issues Ristorante Takada has the makings of one of Singapore's best restaurants. The food was good enough for me to want to go back and see if they can do this
