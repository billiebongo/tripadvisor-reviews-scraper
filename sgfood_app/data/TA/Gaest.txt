Fresh baked bread, fresh and simple ingredients. Have tried all the sandwiches and they are all excellent. For vegetarians, the potato sandwich is my favorite.

High quality food and drink. Lime soda and home made Scandinavia cakes on offer. Jazz music in the background.

I lost my way from Thian Hock Keng Temple to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple but found the good coffee.
Staffs are very nice.
It's opposite the Amoy Street Food Centre.

I really like the sandwiches and salads here. Well made food, interesting presented and efficiently served. Not as cheap as some of the lunch places in the CBD but home made, imaginative cooking makes it worth the price. fantastic homemade bread as well.

Discovered this very cool eatery through a colleague! The cappucino's are perfectly made! So far my favourite coffee place in Singapore!

Tiny Cafe on Telok Ayer/Macallum St. And utterly unpretentious with an excellent pork sandwich (with excellent crackling!) And fresh, moist delicious bread. The beetroot salad was fesh and very tasty.I thought the staff were great and friendly. Shall be back to check on the weekend brunch.Coffee is non-acidic with a slight bitter follow through and mild. For me, very good and the right size

This was my favourite place for salad and soup, one of the best round that area. A small cafe but serves good soup and saladToday I decided to try the pork belly sandwich and I was really disappointed.The so call crispy skin was chewy and unbreakable after chewing. When i gave feedback the staff all laugh from service to kitchen and think it was funny that I made that remark. Now this is not at all funny and I wish they could change my sandwich but they made no such effort.The service girl tried to offer coffee but i didn't accept it. Kitchen guy quickly took a small piece of pork and heat up in the oven and ask me to try it. Is absurb when you try to oven heat a cooked piece of pork which makes it even harder to eat.Sadly I don't think I will ever want to come back to this place again.Just felt disappointed over the stafff reaction laughing about the pork not cracking. Alex if you are reading this review I hope you educated your staff about how to respect a customer complain

Staying nearby on our latest trip to Singapore, searched for good cafes and came up with Gaest. Followed the advice of other reviews and went for the pulled pork sandwich (though there really wasn't a contester on the menu).Absolutely delicious with fall-apart pork, crispy crackling on yummy sourdough. This is clearly their go-to dish. The coffee was very good but tiny for the $4.50. Service was a bit gruff, but not unfriendly

Totally love the texture of the sourdough and it goes so well with butter. Flat white or a cuppa was fantastic as well. For awesome nordic sandwiches do drop by Gaest! For a healthier option do try their homemade muesli with greek yoghurt.Small cafe just opposite Amoy street food centre

The food here is spectacular. It has the best sourdough bread in Singapore, and the sandwiches come in surprisingly generous portions. My favourite is the smoked salmon sandwich which is so well-balanced (not too salty!). It's a fantastic lunch place. A little pricey though and there's little space in the shop (but that makes it nice and cozy!)
