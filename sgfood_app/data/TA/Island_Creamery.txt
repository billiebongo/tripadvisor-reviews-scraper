We love popping by here after our dinner/drinks at Bar Bar Black Sheep next door. The ice cream flavours always rotate which gives us something to look forward to, and the service is always good. :)

This review pertains to the Joo Chiat Road branch.
Granted, the selection of ice cream on offer is fair enough however the customer service of the lady on was nothing short of disgraceful. Rude and discourteous.
Certainly won't be returning.

I've visited island creamery a few times and enjoyed their pulut hitam ice cream. If you enjoy the dessert, you will enjoy the ice cream. I tried the soursop sorbet yesterday too and totally enjoyed its refreshing taste.

Utterly disappointed with the ice cream and waffle. Been there before about 5-6 years back. Decided to return last weekend for nostalgia reasons and I must say it was a complete let down. First of all the place was hot and stuffy (went there at noon) and tables and chairs were messy. Hardly any room for a pram. There was only one service staff who looked very depressed. The ice cream options were limited and nothing to shout about. Waited 20 min for the waffle which would have been fine if it was worth the wait. When it finally arrived, we just couldn't stomach it. It was the most awful waffle I've ever had. The chef at the kitchen needs to fix the recipe please. I now know why the place was half empty when we went. I will not return

Came here for dessert after dinner with my family. We ordered a chocolate lava cake, baked alaska, coconut icecream, reverso (chocolate) and teh tarik (milk tea) ice cream. Absolutely recommend the chocolate lava cake, it is so rich, gooey and the insides flow out when you cut into the cake! The "reverso" (chocolate) ice cream has a rich flavour too. The baked alaska is light and fluffy. The teh tarik tastes just like milk tea, but the flavour is not as strong as the other items we ordered. Made the mistake of trying the lava cake before trying the teh tarik ice cream, could not taste the ice cream at all... They have lots of unique ice cream flavours that are uniquely Singaporean, definitely give those a try

What is wrong with the service staff?I'm the one who greet her first, yet she doesn't greet me back and her facial expression seemed like we owe her a million bucks.We are the only customers in the cafe.. and she left us in all by ourselves still have the cheek to go out for a puff.Utterly Disappointe

One of our favourite family treats!We tend to stick to simple ice cream in a cone, but my son tried the sizing hot brownie the other day and said it was gorgeous!Nice friendly vibe and you can buy ice cream in tubs to take hom

Island Creamery seems to be a pretty well known stop for Singaporeans. And I can see why. This is probably the best ice cream I've had in Singapore.Their twist is also making a lot of regional flavors: ping pong Milo, soursop sorbet, Chendol, Tiger sorbet, and even Durian. I usually get the soursop because it is amazing. Real fruit is mixed into it. So obviously the favors is really rich. The environment is what one would expect of a beloved local ice cream store. Inside walls are plastered with photos of people eating ice cream.Strongly recommend

Visited Island Creamy at Joo Chiat branch today in the evening. Heard of many good reviews that the ice-cream is very nice. So I went to give it a try today. The store had no patrons only the staff, a pinoy woman who was playing with her phone without knowing that I was in the store. So I just nicely said hi! She appeared to be annoyed. And gave me that glare then walked over to the ice-cream counter from the cashier. I felt that I wasn't welcome to the store. So I asked what is the popular flavor? And she rudely" All in the front." Straight away asked me you want tub or cup? Obviously I was in front the ice-cream counter..I am like what a day! Don't think the ice-cream is nice! She is really rude! The bad customer service left a bad taste in my mouth. True enough after 5mins, 2 Ladies went into the store to purchase ice-cream and after a while they started to talk to her and came out complaining. Looks like your staff spoiled many people's day on what is supposed to be a happy ice cream day

It is no small feat to makeThe best ice cream in Singapore especially since it's so hot and people need to satisfy the crazy things people that are pretty hot and sweatythere are so many different flavors here I just I haven't even tried the mail and I have gone here from around five years and I love it.every celebration deserves an island creamer visit. by the way I'm not sponsored

One of the best ice cream in Singapore. Price is cheap, super value for $$$. Great local selections and many creative flavors. Not too sweet. Must try!!!
5
We visit here at least once a week, and often take their tubs of icecream home. A combination of the usual favourite plus some Singapore special offerings. Very friendly staff.
4
went here after reading about in the Lonely planet guide, the ice cream was really nice and creamy. Would go again.
4
I do like the range of our authentic taste of ice cream offered at the cafe. The mud pie is sinfully worth trying. The service staff is generally happy working. However, we observe one young man probably the owner or his son, is probably a bit impatient or arrogant in his way handling his customer who has a request about their products. We will quite disappointed with that

I needed ice cream and on this visit, I got the Apple Pie Ice Cream. The ice cream had cookie crumble and apple bits folded in. There is a taste of cinnamon, which adds to the authenticity of flavour. Its good!It costs $10 per tub
4
A quaint home grown ice cream and dessert place in Singapore. All their ice creams are preservative free and hence taste really good. Cones, cups and tubs are available. We love to go after dinner. It has a lively atmosphere and really friendly staff.Senior citizens get a free ice cream and my daughters treat my mother each time we go there.Who said only Haagen Daz made good ice cream

With the sweltering heat that we are experiencing this week, I am thinking about ice cream a lot. I popped into one of my favourite ice cream shops and spotted this flavour - Kopi ice cream. I asked and the shop assistant said it’s a regular flavour but not always in stock, as it tends to sell out. I promptly bought a tub. It costs $10.Back home, I tried the ice cream. The flavour is exactly like the local kopi that you get at hawker centres. It has a nice local coffee with taste of condensed milk flavour. Very authentic flavour. Perfect for an after dinner dessert and it’s a two-in-one treat, where I get to eat my dessert and coffee at the same time. Recommended

I have had a craving for Pulut Hitam dessert for 2 weeks. Last weekend, I decided to pop by to get a pint of their Pulut Hitam Ice Cream. Good thing is they have it in stock! It costs $10. Brought it back home and I finished a third of it in 1 sitting. They also have other local flavours such as Horlicks, Chendol, Teh Tarik in addition to unique flavours suchj as burnt caramel as well as bananas and cream. Recommended

Where's my Durian Ice Cream!?!??!I am Desperate! Exasperated! Having set aside my craving for their wonderful durian ice cream for other popular flavors once again, for 9 weeks consecutively! Yes I know everyone else may be luckier as supply is slow...Damn them and their principles for wanting only the best durians only.Sigh.... Next week then
4
A good place to have dessert such as ice-cream and waffles. They have a large variety. The environment is nice and cosy, but the crowds usually start packing in an hour before closing time so come earlier to have a larger pick of seats. The walls are adorned with photos and captions that past visitors have left, you can leave your own as well if you can find some space. After closing hours, you can still hang around at the outside seats but the shop itself will be closed
4
Still a good clean fun location patronised by lots of students. Has a good energy to the place, and great ice cream.
4
This ice creamery serves some of our favourite Singaporean flavours that you won't find elsewhere. When we were last there, we enjoyed flavours like Tiger Beer, pineapple tart, Chendol, Horlicks and Milo. Such fun flavours and not overly sweet too. Delicious.
4
This is one of the earlier ice creameries. Started off being affordable, so maybe that's why it's so crowded these days. Two great selling points: fantastic local flavors and lovely airtight boxes for take home packs. Love it!
4
The local flavours that I like are horlicks, durain and chendol. I would recommend this to my overseas friends when they are in town :)
5
Tucked into Serene Center this little spot offers a wide selection of ice creams with unique flavors (burnt caramel is my personal have). The staff is always very helpful as well!
5
Not only are their range of icecream flavors wide, but they also taste great - perfect pick-me-ups any time of the day for any occasion.
5
Fantastic ice cream, stunning flavours. Extremely friendly staff. Buzzy atmosphere playing good music. So glad we found this place, will be back many times.
4
My entire family love its ice cream , creamy rich and simply yummy and make you crave for more. Although the price is not really cheap but we always make it a point to have it at least once a month.
4
Our family loves ice cream and we often visit this place. They have good ice cream flavours and ice cream cake too!

Ice cream appeals to nearly everybody but what helps an ice cream parlour connect with its customers are flavours they offer. The more unique the better, and this establishment tries hard to do that with 4 or 5 different ones. Names like Bandung, Milo Ping Pong, Pulot Hitam and Pineapple Tart are probably unfamiliar to most non-locals but would resonate immediately with Singaporeans. But does it really matter if you don't know what you've chosen? One of the beauties is in discovering something new that you didn't know you liked just 5 minutes before.Was at the Serene Centre branch on a weeknight and it was crowded - lots of youngsters too. I guess everyone was having a good time

Love their coconut ice cream!
They offer a variety of local ice cream flavours which are all very good.
4
You must try the pulot hitam ( black grain rice ) & coconut flavored ice cream ! We usually end up buying tubs of them home.
4
Friendly warm service made the experience very welcoming. The flavours are uniquely local favourites like Horlicks, Milo Ping pong, pulot hitam, teh tarik. All very delicoious!
4
Lots of interesting ice cream flavors.
The ice cream cake is great too
5
Must try their Teh Tarik Ice cream... Favourite hangout place for teenagers
4
I love their new creation. My favourite is the Pulau Hitam which is a local Chinese favourite hot dessert made into ice cream. Try it if you like sweet desserts.
4
We love our ice cream and this place really is good. I've had richer ice-cream but also at twice the price so not complaining. There are seats inside and out. Inside always seems really cold to me though.. duh! maybe because they are serving ice-cream! The sundae is great, the apple pie is ok. I haven't tried the ice-cream cakes but they look really good!We always go after dinner and it is full of teenagers! But it really doesn't matter, just expect that it could be a little loud if there is a big table. We take the baby in the stroller and there is plenty of room. It's a nice, relaxed place to hang out and eat good ice-cream

Everytime I visit Singapore, this is a must to visit. All flavour are unique and many local influenced flavours which catches my taste. Have not managed to try all yet, but these are some of the yummy flavours: burnt caramel, horlicks, pulut hitam, durian, soursop and everything else
4
We discovered this place on the way back from the hospital. First impression – hangout spot for teenage lovebirds in school uniforms. The quality of the ice cream shocked us. The texture was smooth and the flavours were layered – subtle notes blending in with heavier tones. Try the Rocher flavor. There’s a lot of local flavours like black beans and such but we weren’t adventurous enough to venture outside our perennial favourites
5
One of of my favourite hangouts. They sell a variety of icecream flavours, and at a reasonable price. They even provide free flow of milo and horlicks powder toppings (Might not be much for you guys, but i love it). Wonderful way to relieve stress, or even have some fun with your friends. They allow you to print out your photos or draw on papers to paste on their walls as decorations

This is 1 of the few ice cream shops that offer Singaporean flavours of ice cream ranging from Pulut Hitam (black porridge dessert), teh tarik (milk tea) to ping pong Milo. Tourists and people who are adventurous should try the local flavours.
4
It is okay...I hate the smell in there!But they're ice cream and ice cream cake is very nice!Bought a ice cream cake for birthday and it was delicious!
4
A variety of "local-flavoured" ice-cream.

One of our family's fave places for ice creamy-goodness! We've been going since their early days when they were just a hole in the wall at Serene Centre. Love the Nutella and the rare but delish Bandung!

Don't fancy ice cream, but cozy place.

Best local ice cream. Handmade and fresh, local flavours like teh tarik, chendol, pulot hitam, black sesame, horlicks and tiger (beer) sorbet stand alongside cookies and cream and the very chocolatey reverso. A much better value than Ben n Jerry's as you're not paying for freight and brand
