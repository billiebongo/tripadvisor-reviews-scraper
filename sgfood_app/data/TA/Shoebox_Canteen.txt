limited menu but very well executed items. A small, casual place that fronts and great bar just behind it. It has a young vibe.

Great place for drink but not for food, food choice is less but service is great. I'm food hunter, so is a bit disappointed.

The food here is delicious and we had good service. However, the menu is incredibly limited. We thought the idea behind the cocktails was great but opted not to spend $25 per drink.

Me and my girlfriend had a great experience of this place. The local is very nice and we were very happy with the kind waitress as well as with great food and drinks. Recommended!

Excellent bar but a bit noisy. People go for cocktails but they aussi serve food. Limited choice but very good quality. Service is a bit "relax"

Very nice ambience with good live music but selection for food is not so great. In addition to that there were some dishes not available or sold out. Service is great with very attentive staffs. May be back but only for drinks as they have a good range of cocktails

My family and I visited the cantina one day for lunch. We had black burgers and some mock-tails and everything was amazing. I'm sure if we had visited in the evening the atmosphere would have been even better. Nothing bad to say. Visit if you have the chance :

We came to try Bitters and Love in back and the food out front. They do serve cocktails in the restaurant but no food in the bar. The restaurant is small so we made reservations. If you don't like a draft, do not sit with your back to the door. It got annoying after about 15 minutes, especially as it was a cool and rainy night. My partner had the steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare and so tender. It wasn't a large piece though for the price (or maybe because I wanted more!). I ordered the duck confit which was good, just not as good as the steak. They also had kitchen issues and so my duck didn't arrive until after my partner had almost finished his steak. The waitress was very apologetic and it's not her fault but it was still annoying. I saw burgers and fries going to other tables that also looked good but almost every table had ordered the steak. We will definitely go back for more steak and cocktails! The restaurant is small but cosy. It's not fancy and the tables are a little close together for intimate conversation but the place has a nice vibe to it - good for a casual not romantic date

Wonderful food, and the cocktail concept is great, however the service is poor at best. It was very quiet when we went in, yet we still waited over half an hour for the waitress to bring us another drink, and then she got the order wrong, she really seemed bored and disinterested which is a sham

We just had dinner at this cute little 'shoebox' restaurant. Yummy food and great customer service.
Beef burger was great and highly recommend getting the Bread Basket as entr√©e.

We didnt know this place existed until a friend told us about it. Situated between Boat Quay and Clarke Quay and opposite beautiful park. Excellent table service and simple modern bistro food but big in flavuors.Try their classic hamburgers homemade from 100% ground beef.

We are frequent patrons here and come back every time for the amazing atmosphere , reasonable prices (starters $10 to mains $20) and friendly staff. Menu tweaks every 6 weeks which makes it interesting.

This eatery caught my eye with its' 5 bubble TripAdvisor review and it was so close to Chinatown, hence my partner and I decided to give it a try. The waitress was very accommodating to give us a table although they were fully booked for the day. She even took the time to explain very politely their menu for the night and provided her recommendation. We were sold when she shared more about their crab cakes.It is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, my two thumbs up!Recommendation: Do book early with them to secure a dining spo

Just visited Shoebox Canteen and was about to praise the food, drinks and ambience when the most amazing thing happened. We were struggling to get a taxi to get us back to our hotel and after 20 mins of trying and failing, the owner Ernest drove us home in his own car !! So go to this place, not only is the food brilliant, the ambience lively, and the music perfectly chosen - the people who own and run it are good people. And in my book that combination is rare and precious - as was their delicious burger and truffle fires, which I demolished in record time

We went to the restaurant after visiting China Town. They have a small menu but everything on the menu sound very good. We tried the burger and the crab cake which were both excellent! Although we did not jave cocktails they looked very good. Especially also the service was the best we had in Singapore

recommended by the concierge at park royal pickering (which is a fantastic place to stay). we wanted somewhere that is not your typical french or italian. so shoebox canteen popped up. interestingly enough, the duck confit was confit over 2-3 days using their local duck instead. it wasnt overly salty and still had the duck flavor with a crispy skin as it should be. the prawn pasta was using local sea prawns, oven grilled with garlic, chili and olive oil. it was succulent and tasty. the prawn bisque stock went well with the pasta. we really enjoyed the food

When you arrive at the restaurant, will only see "36" with no name on it. It is a joint business of Shoebox Canteen and Bitters & Love. If you want to have a la carte meal, have to sit at Shoebox. Bitters only serve fingers food. The all time favourite menu here is the burger. The right amount of fat drips when I had it. Fabulous!We also ordered the steak. Cook how we like it. medium rare....served on the bed of mashed. Well presented. Had a glimpse at the chef. Very much good looking. lolMy photos do the talking.The service here is top notch. All are locals. Very much represent Singapore. A bit of fresh air from foreign staff from restaurants in Boat Quay, Clarke Quays and 5 star hotels that only know how to patronise customers. If you want to know seafood restaurants that's tick their box without getting ripped off, just ask one of the staff around. They would be happy to guide you
