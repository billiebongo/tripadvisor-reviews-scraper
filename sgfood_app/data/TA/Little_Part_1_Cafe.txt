Peacefully tucked away from the busy beast that is Upper Thomson Road, you would never have reason see this place. It is well located from Windsor park, and oozes "cool" without being pretentious. Belgian themed menu with quirky artistic decor

Had a late evening dessert and coffee here! Very good coffee and quaint little venue to chill out! Inexpensive affogato!

Was at their new outlet at Blair Rd. A nice & cozy place, everyone there is like a family. Some staff have work with the boss for years. Today tried their chicken salad, nice sauce , fresh veg, pretty presentation. Next we had thier sausage with whip potato & corn. Nice Germany sausage, nice taste & crunch. Like it. Finished with prawn pasta. House red wine was smooth, went next door for more drinks. Had Yamazaki whisky, smooth & nice tast

Located near Thomson Plaza and off the main road. It is a little hard to find for first timers. The menu offers a wide variety of European fishes: Irish beef stew, Belgium mussel & fish stew, German sausage... etc. It also has a wide variety of drinks / beer. It was an interesting experience but for some reason I was just not very impressed by these European flavor.

My first visit and my partner recommended the stew. The fish and mussel stew on a cool rainy day is just what I need. The very lightly breaded fish is flavourful in the tomato based gravy, just right hint of tangy. The sides of a very fresh simple green salad of lettuce, arugula is superbly refreshing. I love the slight bitterness of the arugula leaves. Mmmm mussels fresh and done just right so it's not rubbery or shrunken. Wow! Quiet ambience, restful, attentive service. Must come. And variety of beer is good. Mmmmm. Only thing .... Minus ... Parking . But worth coming

We found this place through a friend last year, and decided to try it with our 4 kids. Loved it - ever since that day, we've been here once every often, whether there's an occasion or not. Favourites are the BBQ wings, Irish beef stew and of course the mussel pot, which we have every time. Pizzas are nice too, but you have to come after 8pm to order the pizza, so early dinner with the kids won't work if that is a must

This place is hidden near Thomson Plaza, it felt nice the moment we walked in. Feel comfy and place is nice. They serve delicious food... We had salmon spinach, Shepard pie, buffaloes wings & apple crumble. We enjoyed the food so much especially the dessert. Server are friendly. As for parking, it might not be easy as lots are limited

Good food with a nice ambiance that really helps to make a meal truly special. The cafe is located in a nice quiet area and is run by what we thought was one family. The food was good home cooked food. I had the chicken schnitzel and it was very good! Definitely recommended to anyone looking for a cool little cafe for dinner one nigh

I have been to this place a couple of times before and just recently again to have some quality conversations with a group of friends over drinks and good food. I have always thought that this place is quite a gem tucked a bit off from the busy Upper Thomson Road and that is why discovering it is like finding a diamond within the crevices of rocks.This quaint and homey cafe exudes a relaxed atmosphere with a tinge of hip and modern vibe through the music they are playing. Loud enough that you can hear it yet soft enough so you could talk comfortably with your companion without disturbing those seated on the table next to you.The food's taste is good. The flavors are balanced. The servings are plenty and are actually good enough for sharings if you are small eater. It's a good thing that they serve plenty of leafy salad on most dish. The dish that stands out for me is their weekend special (only saturdays and sundays) Beef Stew, which is so tender, and flavored just right. The Mussels is not bad, they are plenty and meaty.The price is fine, I think. For the serving quantity, and the quality, you are actually getting your money's worth.The Staff are friendly and attentive. There's only one problem with this place, which is parking availability. Since this gem is tucked within a residential neighborhood, there is not much parking spaces available. However, you may park at the nearby Thomson Plaza, and just walk for a short while along Upper Thomson Road and turn at Jasmine Road

Not far away behind Thomson Plaza on Jasmine Road, you can locate this cozy and rather homely cafÃ© that sells a gamut of craft beer and ciders. Parking is the only issue here as the lots are limited. You'll have to circle around the private estate to secure a parking lot. Food wise, I will recommend any lasagna. Staff is friendly and you'll certainly have a great wine & dine opportunity with your date
