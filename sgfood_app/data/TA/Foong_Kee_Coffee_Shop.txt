Sauntered in looking for a second morning cup. Appears to be a local Chinese eatery. Absolutely no sign or evidence of coffee anywhere. Did not partake of anything there. Poor rating due to misleading name

Tried this coffee shop yesterday for lunch.
The place was always crowded during lunch.
Their chasiew melts in ur mouth.
Their roast pork also a must try
Definitely one of the best in Sin

Delicious char siew and noodles. Nice wanton noodle and roast meat. Cheap and good food in this restaurant.

The coffee shop only has one stall, and it sells Cantonese roasts: char siew, roasted pork belly, roasted duck etc. I found the char siew a bit chewy but the roasted pork belly was fine. Dumpling soup was also ok. The coffee shop is extremely old and looks like it needs a bit of renovation though some may appreciate the old school look. The sight of mynahs scavenging for food in the dustbin area at the back of the coffee shop (where the air well is) may be a turn off for some.

Try the signature Chinese roast pork ("char siew") at this well-known shop that's been in the area for over half a century. Friendly place, tends to sell out quickly by lunchtime, so come early, e.g. around 11.30am. Prices are affordable, starting at S$3.Excellent choice if you're staying at the hotels nearby

Came here for a second time as we had a good experience. As expected the service was personal yet professional and food excellent. Special mention to banana (Patna I think is her real Name) for fantastic service over 2 nights and Ruben for the most excellent service on tonight. Had a white wine cloudy Bay 2013 which was stored well and tasted as expected. Food wise we the grilled Tiger prawns, soft shelled crabs and morning glory veggies.. As expected excellent! The food was well cooked and tasted really nice. For dessert I had the feed banana with roasted rice and ice cream.. Delicious!! I recommend this place totally. Every request is met with a smile and carried through. For me five thumbs out of five is not enough... Enjoy!!

Roast pork with crackling skin, scorched char siew caramelised to perfection. Have it with rice or noodle. Comes with a clear soup.The noodle was crunchy yet tender. The roast pork with a nice blend of fat and lean meat. The char siew perfectly scorched at the right places. Soup and chilli condiment just nice. Service is prompt and without frills. In keeping with its coffeeshop image. We sat al fresco on the five foot way corridor of the outlet. Fantastic

I'm pretty particular about my roast meats - duck needs to have a nice skin, be tender, and not overly sweet from the sauce and rub. Crispy roast pork has to have a lovely crisp crackling, tender meat that has some of the fat under the skin rendered out but retaining some juiciness. Foong Kee's rice is standard but a little dry even with duck gravy, but their noodle accompaniment is superb - al dente with a nice bite.Getting a table can be tricky - don't be afraid to ask strangers to share their table or to stalk a group that's finishing up. The staff are nice enough but there aren't any niceties here. They're so busy they expect you to give way, especially when they're carrying a tray laden with food and hot soup.Don't skimp on an inexpensive meal. Skip the $3 portions and get at least a $5. Or even $6

The best, by far, wantan mee, roasted duck, BBQ porc and rosted porc in the area. Congratulations to the hard work of the team working non stop there. Excellent

Thought it was a famous one as read their article at the front of the outlet. Price wise was pretty good deal. Service was very unpleasant though...but what could i expect for a 3.50 SGD Wonton noodle...

Old style eateries like these are fast fading from neighborhoods.
This place has been around for ages and the roast pork and cha siu are fabulous. Took some home to mother-in-law !

Very rude staff to tourists, but the food is very good.
Char view and roast pork with noodles is recommended!

famous for their char siew/roast pork in singapore, i feel that its only so so for me. i prefer the char siew in kay lee at paya lebar.

At $3.50, it is value for money char siew and siu yuk rice. The siu yuk was a combination of tenderness and crispiness yet not oily. Very well done! Hands down expensive versions at food court.

- one of the best charsiew in town - thick, flavourful, with bits of crispy skin on it.- rice, however, is a dry anticlimax.- service is quick, despite not having many hands and the weekday lunch crowd.- not many parking spaces, come by foot

I don't usually get around here but when I do, it's usually because it's time to renew my first aid license as the training centre is just nearby.This place is very crowded during lunch time but that said, if you're slightly earlier you can still get a seat. It's coffee shop style so don't expect it to be sparkling clean. The roasted meats are also roasted indoor so you can see this gigantic roasting pot (what do you call it?) at the inner side of the coffee shop.For $3.50, you get your worth of char siew rice/noodles! Remember to ask for half fat/half lean meat if you could; that literally melts in your mouth! If you reckon you need some roasted meat, you can also top up at $1 only.Only $4.50 for roasted meat and char siew of great quality - what more can I ask for
