Visited Baja fresh @ sail.... Kids enjoyed thoroughly... Nice ambience.... excellent food.... Good value... Must try!!!!

ate burritos at CBD area just now. It was so delicious. They offering 1-for-1 beer also.
Great deal.
5
YUMMYYYYYYYYY! A great place to lunch in the cbd! Cheap and good! Worth a try and will recommend to everyone

Food was great! Guac was nice. Will come back a second time. Casual setting good for a casual dinner with friendsüòä
5
We had a great time drinking beer and chatting. The atmosphere is very chill and the beer tower looks great!

First time eating there. We were told that the items we ordered come with Jalepanos and brown rice - turns out you have to pay extra for those. Contacted customer service, they only replied after a follow up. They admitted the mistake, apologized and did absolutely nothing to correct the problem. Eat Mexican elsewhere

I had the Baja Chicken Bowl. Portion was pretty generous, and comes with a small side portion of tortilla chips, a small cup of salsa, and 2 other spicy side dressings.Prices indicated on their menu and display board are before Service charge (10%) and GST (7%) From diner perspective, would have appreciated to have these prices indicated upfront. Service is a mix between fast-food and table service - You queue to place your order, but meals are delivered to your table. Cutlery and water is self-service.Cosy, laid back, casual setting - nice for a quick work-day lunches
5
We enjoyed the food and the servings were pretty large. Service was great too!
There is also happy hour, which is good for people who want to enjoy a margarita with their dinner:)
5
Awesome food and ambience. Very tasty food and good staff. The food was very fresh. Also the drinks were very nice
5
Baja Fresh Mexican grill is a good place to hang out with friends and serves good food at an affordable price at all times (24/7) my favourite thing about this restaurant is the salsa and the jelapeno given as condiments
4
Always been to the outlet at rendezvous hotel but now that I discovered the sail outlet, I will come here instead! Good food decent portion and love their chicken tortilla soup!!
4
really pretty decent if you consider the fact that they are actually a fast foodish kind of place. portions are good for the price too
4
HEARTY MEAL, VERY FULL. price is unfriendly for students like me üòî but i guess its kinda worth it cause the portion is quite big and you probably wont need to get dinner. Also its 24/7 üëå

Our first try of Mexican food in singapore and pleasantly it was tasty and we loved it :)
Will recommend you t Bret it out if you like Mexican food.
4
Refreshingly tasty fast Mexican food which tastes much better than appearances would suggest. The burritos were particularly good - although could be a little more spicy. Churros are delightful too
4
Good location, good food, good service.
Fresh food, cheap drinks, lotsa promo (like write reviews and get free stuff)

This spot was located at The Sail, next to the Hooters restaurant. We were happy to find it open on a Sunday for lunch. The nachos were perfect, real melted cheese, tasty salsa, and fresh chips. The other meals ordered were satisfying as well: chicken burrito, American tacos, and burrito bowl. Exactly like we remember from the US (delicious!), but prices were crazy Singapore expensive
4
Good portions of food. The quedasillas of chicken breast were nice, good approximation of north mexican food.
4
The food was really good ! Loved the ambience . Loved quesadilla . Food was fresh and yummy .üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
5
Tacos and burritos are great üòõsalsa is yummy too. The taquitos are abit too dry:( but it's was a great experience!
4
The food was fresh and the chicken I ordered was also excellent. I wonder how their chirps taste like though.
5
I ate the spicy chicken quesadillas and it's üíØüíØüíØ the first time i ate here is last month and tried the margarita which is fresh af
5
The Mexican food is great! Try the fajitas, the chicken is perfect, not dry and well seasoned. The upkeep is nice and clean with lovely Mexican music playing.
The staff is friendly and welcoming .
4
for a quick and simple mexican meal without all the frills. nothing fancy but a decent place for a quick bite. great that they open late too
3
While the food was pretty good, it is overpriced given the quantity ($16 for a small quesadilla that isn't even filling for a relatively small eater). It's also quite strange how there is service charge for everything, even though you have to order from the counter. I mean, one doesn't have to pay service charge when dining at KFC, and the amount of "service" provided is about the same. Also, I bought a small coffee, and I was again charged service charge for that, which is quite unheard of for any type of establishment serving coffee

I used to prefer this branch to the one at Rendezvous Hotel because the food was fresher and done better. Not to mention, it is usually nice and quiet on the weekends. However, this recent visit left me disappointed. The steak was dry, the vegetables not as fresh, and the overall standard of the food had dropped. It's not bad, but.. it used to be better. Perhaps it was just a different cook on this particular day I went.

We booked for family buffet lunch. They brought us multiple dishes of the same item, so we were unable to sample everything. Some dishes cost extra on an "all inclusive" buffet - a surprise that ambushed us, like a Mexican bandido.No desert included on buffet, but an offer to receive if you wrote a review on TripAdvisor. Hence this review.Finally, all dishes and drinks were served with disposable cups, plates and cutlery. No sustainability - Any concern for the environment is as believable as a Lucha Libre (Mexican wrestling) re-match! Stay away unless you have lots of cash and your tastebuds are undemanding.

Great Mexican food! Our usual place for work lunches - the fajitas are great, love the churros too!!!!!!!!!
4
Good service, decent food, good place to hangout and chill.
It's also on entertainer app so that's a plus!
2
Pretty ok.Average food.slightly overpriced for quantity.would recommend if any individual came her with their friends over the weekend
4
Pretty decent Mexican food, something that is hardly available in Singapore. Churros are extremely good
3
Ok burrito, meat could have done with abit more flavour. Ingredients were decent. Ambience was alright as it was not as crowded.
5
Really yummy food and really big portions! Best fajitas I've had in a while. Also comes with rice and nachos so definitely worth the price!
5
Been here the 4th time, healthy food with good Mexican flavour... extremely helpful staff who cater to my special requests !
5
I am really fond of Mexican food and love it...Baja Fresh is a very clean fresh and delicious restaurant the food taste fresh clean and delicious.....Their desserts are absolutely amazing....The display of the restaurant is a very good feeling to sit in .....I recommend this restaurant ....If you guys want Mexican be sure to come to Baja Fresh!!!!
5
The service was excellent and they prepared our order super fast! The food is always amazing and made with fresh ingredients. Highly recommended. The best part is that it's one of the few places open till late! =D can't go wrong with this place and with Mexican food!
3
It certainly took me a while to locate this eatery. The food was ok. We were surprised we had to pay service charge when it was like a fast food restaurant style type of service. The staff were friendly and helpful.Might be a while before we return to dine here again
4
It is a brand new place we bumped into. Food is fresh and service is great! Our kids love the nachos and our salads are very tasty!
2
Not very impressed with this place. The food is mediocre and quite expensive. Everything is served in disposable plastic, so really not at all good for the environment. There are definitely better choices around.
4
Prices are very decent especially after the entertainer and taste is not bad. There is a nice selection of beers for those who need to keep fresh in the sweltering heat, overall nice ambience
3
Just an average Mexican food and pretty much overpriced. Choice of meat other than chicken, cheese, jalape√±o, and other incur additional cost and it quickly adds up to $20 meal.
3
The food tasted great and the drinks were nice! The service from Gokul was extremely good aswell I was very pleased with coming here, would recommend to people near by for a nice lunch!
4
Definitely one of the better options if you fancy mexican food.
This place caters more to the business lunch crowd. Food quality is quite good, and price is reasonable.
I usually get the pork carnitas baja bowl, delicious.
5
Great place and good food. Staff are very friendly and accomodating.
Food is always fresh and have a wide choices of drinks.
5
Outlet is nice and has a modern concept. Their food is better than guzman and gomez so if you're in the CBD area craving for a taco or burrito, I highly recommend Baja Fresh üëçüèΩ

I only started writing this review for the free churros for trip advisor post promotion the place is currently running. However, when I went up to the counter to show them my concocted 5 star positive review. In hindsight, unsurprisingly the sour puss who served us initially was no where to be found. My review of the place is as a result much more honest.The burrito was ok, but extremely overpriced for the amount that you got on the tray. Which is probably the reason the restaurant was completely empty during the lunch hour rush. Aside from my group and a staff member seemingly passed out on a table at the back.I wouldn't normally comment on the candor of the wait staff, but the server was particularly unfriendly to the point of being rude. I don't think I saw her make a single friendly comment or facial gesture in our 5 minute counter or should I say ordeal with her.This place needs a serious rethink of both it's customer service and food pricing it wants to survive in the crowded marketplace
4
We tried out Baja Fresh - a Mexican fast food place. The tacos and quesadillas were very good, perhaps a trifle too juicy. What impressed me, for a fast food joint, was the fact that we could pay after we had finished eating. Worth multiple repeat visits.
5
Super fast service and amazing burritos! Nacho chips + salsa with your order! Great price to match! Will definitely be back again!
5

Fuss free mexican food! Very convenient to grab a quick bite :) they even sell cirspy cinnamon churros!
4
Convenient for after work food & it has one for one entertainer app too. Preferred their tortillas over burrito bowls.
Book with chope app with extra points!
3
An order by the counter small restaurant at the Sail, Marina Bay area.
Quite authentic and fresh, however some of the single taco's meat portion is quite small.
5
Conveniently located in Tempe CBD are with appropriately priced food, quick service and most of all- always open!
One of the best work-lunch options around
5

Cheap price and the ambience inside of storeys perfect.. Good for big group or especially for couple.. Two thumps up guys..

We were on holiday in Singapore and I had stumbled across a groupon offer for a Mexican unlimited buffet meal. We had trouble finding this place and were disappointed to find it to be like a fast food type place. Our disappointment was nothing compared to the disappointment of the staff though! She sigged dramatically and told her co-worker 'it's 6 groupons!'The unlimited buffet was actually a set menu which you could order more of. The nachos were cold and stale but sadly a highlight compared to the other food.A taster plate then arrived. The chicken in the burrito and taco was cold. I queried this and was told that burritos are served cold and that the salsa in the taco had made it cold. The soup had been microwaved. Badly! Mine was scorching, my husband's one still cold. I'm any case it was vile!The next lot of food contained undercooked chicken so I returned it.The best thing on the menu was the chicken fajitas. They did not seem keen to give us this. I had to ask 3 times and it was served half an hour late. The chicken was cooked and hot. The rice and beans freezing!Thankfully, we have all woken up this morning without food poisoning!Do not go here! The worst food ever! No atmosphere and sullen moody staff

I went to this place with my family after getting a 50% discount from Eatigo, which I strongly suggest you implement before going to this place as is it generally pricy. I had a Mexican burrito with mahi-mahi ($13 = $6.5 after discount) which was a good portion and tasted pretty good although turned out to be really nothing spectacular. Pretty mediocre drinks choice, ordinary service. Kind of just your average fast food place, if I'm honest. Don't really plan on returning
