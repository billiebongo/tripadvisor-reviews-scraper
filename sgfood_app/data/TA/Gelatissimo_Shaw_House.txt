Always a good stop when you are at Orchard. Many flavours to choose from and you can taste it before getting one. It’s nice and light with creamy consistency. Worth the buck and great for people watching.

I was not expecting to find a good gelato place on the street, when I stumbled on this place. The gelato is good, little pricey ($5 for a scoop). I will go back

nice spot right on Orchard road with a few tables. Kids serving were pushing upsell on sizes to all the customers - just let us order what we want! Not at all friendly.

May not be authentic but doesn't mean it's not good. I could not get enough of the salted caramel. Kids loved their choices too
A bit pricey but I loved it.

This title place is run by efficient polite staff that let you have a little tester of any flavour prior to purchase. They are so friendly and are genuinely happy for you to try before you buy. I had a small tub with 2 flavours - salted caramel and espresso. The flavours were bang on and I recommend it as a great place to get your desert after dining out or just as a treat.

I used to visit the outlets at Takashimaya and Shaw Centre. I totally agreed with some reviewers that the staff purposely try to cover the top of the cup and left a big hole inside. There was a scale there at the counter but they either don't use it or just pretend to put the cup on the scale without really measuring it. This is really cheating. You charge $5.90 for a small cup and that's already quite pricey so don't try to cheat on ice-cream again. I stopped buying from Gelatissimo for a Long time but sometimes I can't stop my kids from wating to buy although they themselves noticed this poor practices. They always call the shop cheaters

Very nice gelato in a range of flavours. You could try them before you brought which is a great idea as you then don't waste your money on something horrible especially as some of the flavours could be unfamiliar. Watch the upselling, if you don't hold to your guns you will end up with a bigger cup/cone than you initially wanted. I watched every customer being upsold with the same lines "only $ more you get an extra flavour ".

I and my wife are Italian. Yestarday wanted to try the gelato of gelatissimo under Singapore flyer, we tasted the vanilla, pistachio, and Belgian chocolate. The texture was sufficient, but the three flavors were the same taste and bad. For us Italians that the food is like a religion. This gelato is not remotely as one in Italy; it has only the Italian name "gelatissimo" then you should simply call ice cream

To me its by far the best ice cream in SIngapore still and no signs of change. They have lots of amazing flavours to choose from and it is reasonably priced. I love going there !!!

Delicious gelato, friendly service. New Nutella gelato was really good, worth a try! Plenty of flavours to choose from

We are European and really enjoyed our excellent ice cream and cold tea! We definitely recommend this place! And the view on the garden bay while enjoying a nice ice cream makes it even better :).

Of the frozen desserts we had in Singapore, this was the best. Pretty close to the "real" gelato flavor and texture.

We were just walking around when we chanced upon Gelatissimo. So we ordered one "Regular" Cup (which gave us the choice of two flavours). We chose Mango and Lemon Cheesecake. The price was SGD 7.50, which was not that bad for the size and the option to choose two flavours, but was still quite expensive. The Lemon Cheesecake flavour was amazing, and nothing like I had ever had before. I absolutely loved it. It really tasted like a lemon cheesecake, with sweetness and saltiness, and even tiny, tasty bits of crushed biscuit crust in the mix!  But I have one problem with the Lemon Cheesecake- at certain times, I got the taste of coconut and the feeling that I was eating coconut bits, which made me wonder whether the scoop for the same coconut ice cream was used to serve my scoop. It was not very common, but not very pleasant either. The Mango flavour we ordered was amazing as well, and the other places where I have had this option just pale in comparison. This was sweet, but not overwhelming, and very delectable. In conclusion, Gelatissimo is a really great ice cream parlour, one I heartily recommend. It is a bit pricey, but worth it

We had dinner at one of the restaurants in the Ion Orchard shopping mall, and were headed back to our hotel, when the idea that "there's always room for Gelato" hit me. This busy outlet has a couple of dozen flavors, some quite familiar, some -- like Chocolate with Chilis" less so. But fortunately, you can ask for a sample spoonfull of any of the flavors to avoid unpleasant surprizes. We ordered small cups at S$5.90 each. The girl who took our order tried hard to up-sell us to the medium cup, telling us that "for only a little more, you get a bigger cup and can have 2 flavors." We resisted. You should know that the small size may look small, but it's pretty big, certainly enough to enjoy the very good gellato without the guilt of the larger portion size. This outlet can be crowded, so it may not be possible to find a place to sit.Hope this review was helpful. I enjoyed the chocolate, and my wife liked the Chocolate Chip

I couldnâ€™t taste any of the saltiness as suggested by the name of the gelato. My friend did manage to taste some salt at the bottom of the ice cream cup.Ice cream is smooth and creamy. Nice chocolatey flavor and there are bits of chocolate cones in it, which has a nice bite

Good (average) gelato compared to all I've had, however better than most of it's type in Singapore. The service is very friendly, space is maintained well and clean, prices are average. Suggest offering a better take away option, as not much option to date other than putting another cup upside down over the top, which ultimately melts quickly

I bought a small cup of gelato. I noticed the manager had the guy scooping the ice cream take ithe ice cream out of the cup and then re-serve it before giving it to me. Less was put in, you could tell by what remained behind. The manager was obviously showing the guy scooping the ice cream how to make it look full while covering the top and leaving the cup empty. When I called him on it, he told me that that's how the serve it in Italy. I guess he took me for a dumb tourist. As a long term resident of the island, I knew it was a sneaky little way to make more money. Despite the flavor, the sleight-of-hand left a nasty taste in my mouth

On a recent visit to Singapore I was taken here for an ice cream on the basis that it was probably the best in Singapore. This was one week ago.It makes much of its association with Italy but I have to say the product in no way approximates to the quality of even the average Gelateria in Italy. I lived there for years and have travelled all over the country. I am also a gelato afficionado so was sorely disappointed by my rather expensive cone.Testimony to this is the fact that I can't rightly recall the flavours I chose. They were quite undistinguished. Surprising, when a lengthy explanation of the difference between gelato and ice cream is there to be read by the customer waiting for his cone or cup.I think the fact is that this is part of a chain with a standardised product. It is presented very well but the form is much more impressive than the substance
