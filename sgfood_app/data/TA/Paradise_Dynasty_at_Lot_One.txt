My parents are huge fans of the Paradise Group chain of restaurants plastered all over the island, which explains my family's frequent visits to their restaurants. They specialise in Chinese cuisine and serve a variety of dishes, from noodles and soup dumplings to hearty traditional desserts. Paradise Dynasty is undoubtedly one of my favourite go-to places for a good bowl of handmade la mian noodles and yummy savoury dumplings The la mian noodles pictured here were accompanied with five juicy and plump prawn and pork wanton, each of them encased in a delicate slippery skin which was amazingly smooth. The noodles had a light and springy texture, and was cooked in their signature pork bone broth. The signature stock is said to have used ingredients like pork bone, pork ribs and whole chicken, and is simmered over slow fire for 12 hours before being served. This thus gave rise to the thick and flavourful broth, yum! Overall, this was an extremely satisfying bowl of noodles! Best inhaled on a cold, rainy day ☔️As for the service wise, it differs for every outlet. I would say that their service is above average, even though the tables are usually not cleared very promptly and the food does take quite some time to be served. Nevertheless, I really appreciate how consistent the quality of the food is across all the Paradise Group restaurants! I can definitely foresee myself patronising their restaurants repeatedly in the near future

Very good ambience .Good decor. Courteous service but staff need to be trained as the sequence of orders are mixed up !. being a working day not much crowded,Price range was affordable ,portions small and so order more food .and Food reasonably good .not the Indian Chinese variety ! Lunch Cost about 80 Sing $ for

In general one can expect consistent quality in the food by Paradise Dynasty. However what was more shocking is the service standard my family received upon checkout. Attempts to use our credit card voucher was met with "system does not approve" by the cashier. Even after calling the credit card company for verification the cashier actually refused to listen to the phone and was adamant that we could not use the voucher. Overall this is not the service standard one would expect to receive in a restaurant

paradise dynasty has varied menu ! taste is simple. not so extra special that wouldmake me crave to come back. the portions of the food is adequate. can share with friends. the cost is so expensive for the kind of food that we ate. but kudos to the staff! they are very organized and professional and is very helpful. give a smile when we ask for recommendation

I was with my family at the outlet at choa chu kang.the service was quite good.the xiao long bao was comparable to ding tai feng standard.i orded ramen with fried pork chop for my son which was quite tasty but soup a bit salty.the yangchow fried rice was too bland,not much fragrance.the egg white with scallop was one unique dish i orded but sadly to say not to my liking.fried chicken was crispy and tasty.the dessert that came late after repeated to few waitresses was the glutinous rice ball with peanut puts a happy ending to the dinner.overall satisfactory dinner.

Visited on 9thOct15' with family around 11:40am,restaurant was already 40% full as including me there were 4 queued waited to be seated. Every crew were busy either taking orders,serving food n attending guests. Purpose of visiting mainly is craving for their Yang Zhou fried rice as few months ago tasted quite well. And Groupon is having a great deal so decided to try. Order through a small ordering list,just tick or write down the quantity that u wanted,then wave the service crew to confirm n process your order. As I don't not under the 6pcs n 14pcs of Xiao Long Bao so I thought can choose my own flavour for the 6pcs-$7.80,so i tick 6 different flavours,the lady,who taking my order just shout out u can't do this way of order and she walked away without clearing my doubts. Honestly, I was quite shocked to her shouting out. Ordered Yang Zhou Fried Rice$11.80, is dry unlike my previous yummy fragrant taste so both of us cannot finished it or it is in a big portion. Crispy Spring Roll,3pcs for $4.50,is hot crispy n tasty. Chilled Aloe Vera, $3.50,actually if chilled will be tasty but it served together with fried rice so by the time we eat it already turned unchilled n the aloe vera cube taste like sour. Water Chestnut drink $2.80. Overall experience was unpleasant with the service of that lady crew. I do understand that the whole restaurant was crowded but do mind your attitude. Had observed that lady,she never put on a smile even attending others. Groupon deal do include 10% + 7% service charge so do need to top up the exceed amount of $50 of $28.80 paid deal.
