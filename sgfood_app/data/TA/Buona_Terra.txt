Very good food and interesting menu. Nice and cozy atmosphere.
The fair skin Singaporean waiter was always grumpy and even didn’t poor the water to my glass, but came to poor water to my partner a few times. I’m not sure what is his problem???

Service, atmosphere, food still at top. The "open" choice to select your menu is a great idea and you definitively can't get wrong on any choice.

Thats Super-b fine-dinning with amazing food and wine selection.
Very impressed and satisfied.
Thank you very much for my romantic dinner with my wife and your kind service and tasty food.

Here for a birthday celebrations. It did not disappoint. Food was authentic. Ingredients fresh. Only limitations are the small menu selection, and similar plating presentation for the dishes.

perfectly presented and delicious menu. good location for quiet business lunch and meticulous service

I went here for dinner to celebrate my birthday with my wife. The service was exceptional - they welcomed us with a complimentary champagne and the night got even better when the dishes started to arrive.They have 4/5/6 course menu, with really flex choices on the dishes. We ordered all the pasta on the list and couple of secondis. The pastas were awesomely dente, really subtle in taste (most SG Italian go overboard with strong flavors) and amazingly presented. The portions were just right (again, many places go overboard with sizes). I have not tasted such light on pallet carbonara in Singapore - add a generous shaving of black truffle and you are in heaven.The iberico pork fillet was again amazing and my wife had the fish dish, which was served up with crispy fried scales of the fish over a juicy portion of the fillet.The cigar-ash chocolate mango desert was both inventive and delicious.They even have private rooms for larger gathering and you can ask them for menu customization in advance if you are looking for something different. because we went on a weekday, the place was quite, which was also something I liked. The steward was very attentive and helped us enjoy the experience.Revisit Likelihood - Look out for special occasions

Our son organised the booking for our 40th Wedding Anniversary from Australia and was very impressed with the professionalism and total ease of communicating his request for a special ‘Chef’s Choice’ degustation dinner complete with a beautifully presented Anniversary message from our Sons. We were made to feel very special from the moment we arrived by being greeted at the door with ‘Happy 40th Wedding Anniversary’ and then presented with a card from the restaurant with a message from our sons.! We were then treated to the most amazingly delicious food we have ever tasted! This was accompanied by exceptional and attentive service by the smartly attired and affable staff who made us feel special, every course being explained in detail and paired with an equally delicious wine. This memorable evening was completed with an extra special course presented with a Happy Anniversary message from our sons written in chocolate! If amazing service and exceptional food is what you seek, then we would highly recommend this restaurant for a superb dining experience! Thank you to the wonderful staff at Buona Terra for a once in a lifetime experience

Situated along Scotts road resided in a old heritage house. Great italian food, ambience is great but little too cramp. Service was great with reasonable wine, very Creative food with combination of Italian with Japanese ingredient like Ikura and uni . The white and black truffle are out of the world ! Simply love it and great selection of wine at reasonable cost ! Should have awarded a Michelin star

Caveat: the following review was written while still intoxicated from too much wine at the restaurant earlier.Now that that's out of the way let's get to the meat of things and my oh my was there meat. Ms Significant Other and I popped in for pur 4th year anniversary and what better way to celebrate than with spectacular Italian food. We got the recommendation from Hui a personal friend and wife of Luca (chef extraordinaire of Da Luca also a must-try for the Italian fanatic) and figured if an Italian chef came here on his off-day then we can't go wrong!The meal began with two different amuse bouche(s?), but the highlight came in the form of a mini parmesan cone with caviar and potato cream.My appetizer was a taglioni pasta with potato cream and white truffle flakes, while hers was sea urchin served in shell with caviar and cauliflower cream. I loved the taglioni for the complex truffly miasma it left on my palate but GOOD GOD that sea urchin was umami! Like being punched in the mouth with a fist full of briny goodness!The cured yolk carbonara came next - almost a signature dish, the pasta was intense and flavorful. More than just the egg yolk and the cheese, there was smoked Italian bacon (guanciale) in there that really elevated the flavor to a whole new level and stood out strong. Girlfriend had the swordfish which (if you can believe it) was so incredible that it managed to overshadow the carbonara! Pan-seared just enough, the swordfish had a firm oily bite to it faintly reminiscent of fatty pork; the flavours bled into my mouth in a heady swirl before the crisp skin and salt cut through the torpor and brought fresh delight!My main was a delicately roasted lamb lacking the gamey flavour I was so worried about thankfully. A parsley crust combined added new dimension to flavour, but the real star of the dish was the Jewish artichoke prepared in three ways - roasted, pureed, and fried chips. Each method of cooking awed me with the versatility of the humble vegetable, since the only artichokes I was familiar with came in a jar and preserved in some questionable solution.As we neared the end of the meal, my dessert was an artisanal cheese platter with a tasteful selection of cheeses and jams. The Roquefort blew my mind, but just as I thought it was impossible to talk to this experience, a tree of four different desserts was brought up before us. Comprising a pistachio white chocolate truffle, a passionfruit jelly, dark chocolate, and an almond biscotti, all 4 desserts were insanely good - think satisfaction like waiting until the end so you can watch rhe secret end credits of a movie. Totally. Worth. It.Our sommelier and host Davide was a joy to converse with all evening, and recommended a full-bodied Sicilian white wine that was perfect for the meal. The restaurant even gave us a complimentary nougat profiterole dessert on the house and courtesy of chef Denis to celebrate our anniversary! Dashing sommelier Gabriele smoothly asked our poison amd returned with a flourish of rum and whiskey - the whiskey in this case being a 20-year aged Nikka Yoichi, so smooth and sweet with a touch of smoke at her tail. Gabriele joined us for a drink after presenting the girlfriend with a Samaroli 1998 rum from Guadelupe of which only 270 bottles of the same existed, further cementing that old world Italian hospitality.We left the restaurant slightly tipsy but extremely happy with the evening's choices. Food? Amazing. Ambience? Awesome. Was it pricey? Well slightly yes, but honestly if you're paying for a fine-dining experience paired with impeccable service and warmth then you can't go wrong with Buona Terra.Many thanks to the team (if they read this) for making this a memorable evening! Maybe next time we will bring Luca and Hui too

Buona Terra is not cheap, let me repeat, it is not cheap. But it is really really really good. The restaurant is small and quite intimate without being over the top. Staff are extremely friendly and very helpful. We allowed the Chef to deliver to us his own creations, within our cuisine tolerances (no pork). This was done cheerfully and wonderfully. Each course is an artistic and taste phenomenon. The wines that come with the courses are excellent and always surprising. Desert was hilariously good, sometimes a cigar is not a cigar. Overall this place is very expensive even by Singapore standards so if you want to dine to impress, and dont have a budget, this is the place to be. You will not be disappointed

The executive lunch was served in a pleasant ambience by good service staff but the quality of the food and the value was 'Just Short' . Portions were small and although flavor was acceptable it was below expectations.
5
Located not too far away from the busy Orchard area, this restaurant is quiet and serene. Ideal for cosy gathering with friends. Food served was delicious and we were all satisfied with the service from the crew.

Considered one of the more romantic Italian restaurants in SIngapore, Buona Terra sets customers in the mood as soon as they step into the rectangular space off on the side of a Japanese Restaurant at 29 Scotts. Wine racks display lined the entrance hall on both sides with bold coloured paintings set off the moods. All good. Food was a little more uneven with some dishes rising to the one * level such as the Tilefish with crispy skin and some almost there such as squid ink spaghetti with bamboo clam. The colour of squid ink contrasted well with sliced bamboo clams served in the shell but the chewy texture of the clams worked less well to have the dish sing. Still, if you are there on an expense account meal or impress a date, there could be worse places to sink that kind of money.

I went last Saturday to celebrate my husband's birthday. All the staff was really friendly, smiling and good communicative. Melissa was really nice to help to arrange a nice surprise for my husband and the restaurant manager offered us a really good dessert wine. The food was really good, it met our expectations. We had the "carta bianca" menu, so we left the chef chose for us. And he chose really well! Really interesting was the zabaione with escargot, I am not a fan of both but it was really nice. The desert was really good, expecially the chocolate cigar!! We found out later that chef wasn't in charge but everything was just amazing, that means the kitchen staff is well trained. Still compliment to the staff floor which is really good and prepared, with a good posture and elegance, something not easy to find in Asia.
3
Food in offer was okay but not spectacular. Service was good and staff were flexible. However too many good set lunch options in town. E.g. For what Les Amis offers in terms of pricing and food, this place comes out short. Even the clam noodles that are featured so prominently falls short as size of portions were too small for value of food
5
Been here four times already and always on special occasions. We usually take the 5 course menu and are never disappointed. Great service and very knowledgeable about the food and the wonderful wine list. The room could be decorated a bit more as it can feel quite empty/bare when only a few tables are taken.Expensive yes, but worth going
5
Have been to Singapore a hundred times however would only know about Buona Terra when invited by friends. What a beautiful place; with really good Italian dishes presented in an amazing style; it's art. But the icing on the cake so to speak are the desserts, haven't seen anything like this so far
5
Amazing food, the best service and the sweetest and kindest chef! We went there for my husband's birthday. Upon arrival, we were told that there was a very noisy/drunk group n if it was ok. Frankly the noise was quite loud. But the food, service, kindness, numerous apologies made up for everything. We will be coming back and have been recommending it numerous times already!

THIS IS A REAL HIDDEN GEM !Not easy to find, but close to NEWTON subway station, this Italian restaurant, with a really Italian CHEF from the Garda Lake, in my opinion is the BEST PLACE TO EXPERIENCE a Michelin Starring Meal, but it is not yet recognized by the famous restaurant guide, this is just an advatage for your wallet. The restaurant offer minimum 4 courses, all of them are ARTWORKS to experience a sensorial journey throughtout the Mediterranean Sea, along with an extraordinary selection of wines.Mostly of the best ingredients come freshly from Italy, a mention to the magnificent GAMBERO ROSSO DI MAZZARA DEL VALLO, an exclusive and rare red shrimp from the Southern Sicily Shore. And also a mention for the use of sauce from fresh FICO D'INDIA, a typical sweety mediterranean fruit. The Desserts are a journey into the journey, it will be hard to choose just one because are really tasty and nice, sometimes a pit to break to taste it. For example they offer a cracking fine chocolate CIGAR filled with a cream, and ASH of sugar posed on an real crystal ashtray. At the end of the dinner you can delight yourself with an impressive selection of Scoth Wisky.In my experienced opinion, this restaurant is the best place in Singapore to have a really luxury dinner, the opportunity to try a worthy Michelin Starred Cousine at the right cost

Love the way the menu is designed. You can choose the no of dishes you like for your meal and you have great flexibility in deciding the dishes. Theres also a nice repetoir of wines and the staff is able to choose a good bottle of wine which is within our budget. The food is good and interesting and overall it was a pleasant dining experience.
5
Had a great meal here!! Only set menu offered!! Food was very good! Prompt and friendly service. Look selections of wines!!
5
Proper nice cosy ambience that serves delightful plates of Italian dishes. Albeit the portions were small, it was surprisingly filling. Chef Denis is very friendly and will come out of his kitchen to check if the food is to your standards.
5
Excellent food and service. Stunning wine list. We had the private room in the back which was perfect for our business dinner. Venue is really nice, in particular for out-of-town guests. We will be going back soon.
5
Celebrated my wife's birthday here. Service was excellent, attentive yet unobtrusive. The food was very very well executed. Thought the mediterranean soup, egg souffle, penne amatriciana and squid ink pasta were particularly good, the pasta perfectly al dente and flavourful.
4
Place was cosy and nice. Service was attentive. Food portion was just good and food was tasty and presentation was creative.
2
The wait staff just took away the bread basket without asking if we need refill. They did not offer a bag stool to hold our bags. I placed my bag on the floor and saw other guest hang their bags in the back rest. Don't expect such service standards from fine dining restaurant. Saw other table being served palate cleanser before next course. But not my table. Inconsistent service based on value of meals ordered?

This was a group business lunch. The cuisine is Italian but with a good touch of influences from other culinary traditions that can be said as masterfully concocted. The restaurant only offers set lunches. Of the sets available, we chose the 4-course menu. It is not a large restaurant and the private room can only accommodate 8 people. However, for larger groups they join up the table so that our party of 14 can have the meal together. Thus it is a cosy atmosphere.Located in a colonial era black and white house, it can be busy therefore it is recommended to book ahead. We had excellent service and the food tasted fantastic. Indeed very good value for money for a power business lunch. Ample parking area too

A small restaurant that offers an interesting menu concept. Choose a 4, 5 or 6 course menu and you can pick any dishes you like (even 6 desserts if you so fancy). We tried 10 dishes in all. One dish was very tasty. We enjoyed the uovo - essentially a poached egg yolk inside an egg white soufflÃ©. The pork was also decent. The rest of the dishes were all right. Well-seasoned but nothing spectacular. The pastas were a bit of a let down. Gnocchi was bland, and the squid ink taglioni was overcooked. The kitchen seemed a bit disorganised. They forgot one of our pasta dishes and it only came out at the end of the meal after our steak - and only after we asked them what happened to it when they asked us if we would like any dessert. They appeared to have clean forgotten about it as it took themanother 20 minutes to produce a spaghetti cacio e pepe. No apologies for the oversight. The waitress matter-of-factly said that there was a table of 16 somewhere else in the restaurant so too bad for us I suppose. The poor service in this supposedly fine dining restaurant was unfortunate. In general waiting times for the dishes were erratic. Some appeared pretty efficiently and others took a while longer. They had a nice and expectedly over-priced wine list. there's better (and cheaper) Italian options around.
5
This was my second visit to buona terra and I'll definitely return when I visit Singapore again. It's a small restaurant but not cramped. Service is excellent. The ability to choose freely across the varied menu to a sample across different courses of ones choice allows for a full and tailored experience of flavours. Add to this a smiling and enthusiastic chef making his diners feel at home and you have a winning combination
5
Buona Terra never fails to surprise. Alta Cucina ( Italian high cuisine) . Absolutely fresh, quality ingredients, transformed via artistic renditions . Matched by wine pairings that truly work. Friendly, genuine, warm and unobstrusive service.No, I do not own shares in this restaurant . And yes, we hope to come back to this " good land" year after year

As every Saturday, we go for a couples dinner. Checked the new Michelin guide and this one was recommended and me t to home.When we arrived we got a bit disappointed with the setting as it was like the garage of a black and White House.We sat and they urged is to get am aperitifs or something to drink. Which after finding out that the min price was for a 4 or 5 dishes and not cheap, you tend to stay as you already ordered something. The couple in front of us left when they found the prices. They didn't need to pay for the sparkling water.The food arrived and it was amazing! Very well done, each dish was just right!!!We won't go back as the atmosphere and the setting is a mood killer. Pity! They put good effor

My wife and I went for dinner with 3 other adult friends. The place is small but nicely decorated, although noisy because conversation flows from nearby tables. It's also quite cold inside. The selection of food is fine if you like seafood. But for people like me who don't enjoy under the sea, selection is limited. For dinner, the selection is 4 course, 5 course or 6 course meals. The items can be anything from the menu, anywhere from all main course to all desert. No a-la-carte is offered. I ended up ordering one item for 2 courses because not much appealed to me. 3 people in our party ordered a dessert item and 3 main courses. 2 people ordered all 4 main course. The first 3 courses were served together in a timely manner. However, the 4th course was somewhat of a disaster. 1 person received her 4th main course alone. We waited but nothing else came. Long after she finished, the 2nd person's main course came. It had been forgotten. After he finished the deserts arrived. It was strange 1 person eating at a time until the deserts arrived. On top of this, I ordered medium tenderloin. It was totally brown and dry. My friend who also ordered medium tenderloin, received it a course after me and it was nice and pink. Noting the vast difference in the way our beef was cooked, I mentioned this to the maitre d. He checked the order and confirmed that we had both ordered medium. He couldn't explain why they were different.I must note here that I'm not one much for fine dining. But $128++ for a 4 course dinner of tiny proportions that were not cooked properly just doesn't cut the mustard. Fortunately, they didn't charge for my overcooked tenderloin and my friend's 4th course which was forgotten. All said and done, this is a place I will never return to or recommend to others
5
Great place. Restricted seating. Reservation is a must. Great wines to complement the food. Had a 5 course meal - just had to tell what our likes and dislikes + allergies and the chef makes up a great meal.Joyce served the table and she was great in introducing the dishes. Can be an expensive affair by the time you have done a few bottles of wine like us on top of the food
4
Buona Terra is nicely tucked behind one of those Stratford-on-Avon influenced bungalows along Scotts road, and reservations are encouraged. Upon arrival you are nicely welcome by the smartly presented well-trained crew. They have a lovely private room and wine cellar within its private area and the Restaurant maitre'd suggests the menu for the day. For lunch there is the Inspiration and Ascencion menu which consists of a appetiser, pasta and a dessert. Chef Denis Lucchi's also has the Costellazione menu and this would be paired of with wines. It's menu features authentic Italian pasta, scampi, fresh dal mare, and also an a la carte menu - dalla terra. After you place your order, dishes are served in small bites allowing you to taste Buona Terra chef's efforts. Great for those who are looking to celebrate private events
5
In my years of travel I have always noticed that a very small restaurant always serves great food. And when I saw Buona Terra and its 20 seater space I was sure we have made the right choice. Fabulous food, great wine and excellent service. The flavours we just perfect. Saffron, truffle, veal, everything was delightful. A must visit in Singapore. Heavy on the wallet but what you pay for is what you get. The Turmisu to finish off was a dream
4
 Prices are reasonable for 3 course lunch sgd 48 . Chef decides what you will be served after you inform staff of your dietary restrictions . Beef carpaccio is too beefy and I had to send it back. Very good main course of fish served . Excellent panna cotta desert - one of the best I have had. Watch out for the price for tea it is 10 dollars per cup!There is complimentary parking as you can park on the premises

We visited Buona Terra recently for a private business dinner. It was our first visit to the restaurant but it will not be our last.The food was excellent, the service fabulous and the choice of wines exceptional. The wines are displayed in coolers in the restaurant and really interestingly lit as they change in colour. We drank some excellent Bordeaux but that seems to have been a special order as the restaurants wine list is primarily Italian. The food was really interesting. We had a set menu which was picked by our hosts. We started with Uni which had been prepared with roe and served in the Uni shell. It was chilled and delicious. This was followed by a really interesting dish of warm duck liver served with a tea flavoured ice cream and a crumble. It sounds weird but was really very good. The next course was a lobster risotto and beautifully prepared. As a main I had the Wagyu beef which was cooked to perfection and exactly as I had ordered it. Dessert was a mix of ice creams and chocolate components.The whole meal was incredible. Really well done. Beautifully presented and very interesting.I would highly recommend a visit to this restaurant if you are in Singapore

In one of the restored black and white bungalows along Scotts Road, the ambience in this restaurant esp the private room is quite perfect. Parking is within the compound and there's a valet if it gets crowded. One chooses a 3-5 course meal at a decent fixed price. Before our courses started, there were two complimentary appetisers which were delicious. The truffle egg custard was my favourite. The seafood soup had chunks of seafood but not as tasty as I'd expected. Lobster pasta was decent. Good choice of desserts. Service was attentive but they did make some mistakes with our orders so best to check that.
5
A fine intalian restaurant in a charming black&white.Gabriele the Maitre D' is also charming and will snarltly pilot you through various succulent dishes.One of my favorite being the ink spaghettis with botargo. Wines are velvet on the palate and some Rosso are worth the degustation. Forza Itialia
5
Was there with bosses and distributors for dinner on a weekday. We ordered sea bass cooked with sea salt and beef for sharing. Each of us ordered our own 2 or 3 course dinner separately. The French waiter then brought out 5 bottles of wine for us to choose, giving us detailed history of each wine. We did choose the Amarone.I had the Parma ham with cheese for appetizer and it was a great start. My main course was lamb and it was also done just nice. Next was the beef and fish for sharing and I must say that the beef with the various sauce and sea salt to accompany was excellent. Fish was also very fresh.For the wine, our colleague from overseas made a very good choice and it went very well with the food. Just that the waiter did not reveal to us the price of the wine even when asked. Finally for dessert, the lava cake was also very good and we were also served chocolates.Overall, good attentive service and nice cosy environment. Good venue for entertaining business guests

Sumptuous Meal and Excellent Service
Especially like the Bamboo Clam with Squid Ink Pasta and Grilled Black Pork Loin.
Like the friendly sommelier and service staff.

Been there several times, nice place to drive your car, easy to park, good food and good collections of wines. very good place to impress your guests.

For more reviews and photos, visit my site hungrybaker.coBuona Terra is an Italian restaurant nestled in a refurbished colonial bungalow in Scotts Road. I had read excellent reviews of the place and was looking forward to trying it.The ambience seemed lacklustre when we arrived, compared with the quaint Indocafe (a sister restaurant) just down the road, and the amuse bouche, a potato cream with prawns, also did not excite the palate. However, a lovely selection of bread arrived shortly after. The fluffy buns were buttery and soft as cotton, and the breadsticks nice and crisp.The Pappardelle Verdi ai Funghi Porcini, or Green Rucola Pappardelle with Porcini Mushrooms, reminded us of a Chinese dish, both in looks and taste. The noodles were done al dente but I would have preferred them a little softer as they were thicker than the usual pasta.The Trota Salmonata con Arance, Olive e Pelle Croccante, or Poached Ocean Trout with Capers, Orange, Olive Powder and Crispy Skin, arrived looking uncooked, but it was soft, flaky and reminded me of smoked salmon in taste and texture. The accompanying olive powder, crispy skin and cherry tomatoes provided bursts of flavour and texture. Really enjoyed this.The Semifreddo al Torroncino e Salsa al Passito, or Nougat Parfait with Passito Sauce, was rich and creamy and sweet, with a taste that made me think of kaya. A sweet ending to a lovely meal

Went for my anniversary and it was my first time. Was even more surprised to find the restaurant full on a Wednesday, but after the meal I could see why.The bamboo clam pasta was one of the best pastas I've had, as well as the pork cheek dish. Service was attentive and they even had an Italian sommelier who was both outgoing and shared his stories. He didn't ridicule our budget for wine and even offered a pairing menu.Overall a pleasant experienc

Came here for a business lunch. The ambience is ok and would be even better if we had a larger group and booked their one large private room. Food was very good. We had the Parmesan brûlée, Squid ink pasta in bamboo clam, bronzini, lobster linguini, octopus salad and all were delicious albeit portions a little small if you are a big eater
4
This fine dining establishment is definitely an experience, but be prepared to open your wallet. I had scallop tartare, and as you'd expect the flavours were delectable while the portion was modest, and an excellent swordfish seared to perfection with a well balanced Salmoriglio sauce. The wines are expensive (especially for an Australian) but if you ask, the helpful maitre'd may find you something more reasonable, as he did with us, finding suitable wines for

My husband and I enjoyed a lovely dinner at Buona Terra.Lovely tasting food, small restaurant and somewhere you can dress up and not feel over dressed.Gabrielle, the man in charge, was very helpful, extremely knowledgeable with wines and very professional.If you can afford it, I recommend it

Dinner party for 10, celebrating a birthdayThoroughly enjoyable from the breads, the entree the linguine the lamb main course all very well received beautifully presented and very tasty.The only problem was the first bottle of red was not optimum and we changedThe Italian beer ( not peroni) was a surpriseI took the train from the city to newton and them a short walk there all with no fussThe bathroom was clean Overall an enjoyable evening and I would go bac

We had a good time when we dine here when we were in town last year.Decided to introduce this fine Italian restaurant to our friends when we met in Singapore.Gabriel the sommelier is still charming as ever and staffs are helpful which make the dining experience so pleasant.The menu is so inviting and wine list is extensive, we went for the three courses menu and finish off with cheese and coffee. My host can not stop raving about the experience.We noticed the place is much more busier than we were here last year

Perfect antipasto! Best was the poached egg with white asparagus and seasonal white truffle! Great mains and super ambience! Difficult to match!

Visited this restaurant on 23rd Dec 2014 for dinner with 2 friends for Xmas gathering. We all know that food portions for Italian fine dining are rather small (but served in a very big plate!!), thus my lady frd and I opted for the 4 course ($98++) and 5 course ($128++) for our guy frd.Buona Terra is very flexible on choice and course of food you like. You can have the choice of all mains or all dessert for the entire course of the dinner. It's up to you. I had 1 appetizer (Scallop Tartare), 1 pasta (Squid ink Tonnarelli with Bamboo Clam) and 2 mains (cod fish and veal tenderloin). The portions are small but I regret for being greedy and went for 4 course. The sauce from the pasta and main course were so rich that I was already full after the cod. Their bread were also very nice... it's freshly baked upon request!! Thus each time we waited ard 20mins for the bread but the wait is really worthwhile.Service - EXCELLENT!!The waiter and waitress are well polite; always ready to explain the dishes and give recommendations. Price wise, we each spent ard S$150 excluding wine, only had mineral water. Besides the dished I had, here are some recommended dishes which my frds had:1. Seared Giant Red Prawns (Appetizer)2. Ox Tail Tortelli (Pasta)3. Charcoal Grill Pork Jaw (Main - Superb!!)4. Lamb Loin (Main)Lastly, there is no risotto in the menu but if you like, just request and the chef will do it for you
5
We hosted a business pre-Christmas get-together at Buona Terra and right from our first arrival to the last person leaving the experience was a delight.Gabriele was a charming host, hugely educated in his food and wines and a very willing host.Each course was expertly prepared and delivered and every single person commented on the quality of the food, absolute winner.Typically with large group dining there is a level of compromise to food quality or service or both, not here, the food was excellent and each course was timed perfectly. Staff communication was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.I would highly recommend this restaurant for food, wine and service - I'm not sure anything else can be added!Thank you Gabriele
5
I ordered the tasting menu with accompanying paired wines. It was both extensive, varied and a delicious combination of flavours and textures. The wines were also carefully chosen. I would definitely recommend this - my only (small) criticism is that the courses may face been slightly too large for an extensive tasting men
5
It was one of the most terrific food experiences in sg. They startedserving a set course meals afterlong discussions and consultations with sufficient guidance. Basically Mediterranean dishes with slight influence of Japansee food materials such as wasabi etc. As four of us were very keen on materials, prior discussions are really essential.Each dish was not overwhelmingly large, well decorated with colorful sauce, and really photogenic. Waiters were all very attentive to us, we enjoyed food and conversation plus cosy atmosphere. As it was the day before of my birthday and the day after my spouse's they offered complimentary fruit cake plate for each of use which was absolutely impressive (I need to be thankful to my friends for their advance notice to the restaurant and prearrangements for us). We stayed the restaurant until midnight since it was so enjoyable moment. Yes, the cost was not very low of course, however, you need to support good restaurants
5
Although not far from Orchard road, this restaurant is best reached by taxi. Don't let the unassuming exterior and the somehow hidden entrance deceive you. This is a restaurant which is very serious about excellent service and top class Italian food. Both the maître 'd ( Gabriele Rizzardi) and the Chef are Italians. The Burrata served with the finest of Parma Ham is outstanding, so were the linguini with fresh bolettos, the papardelle were the best I ever had. They also have a friendly approach to you bringing in some wine - buy a bottle from them and they wont charge you corkage for your own bottle. A slight negative is the air-condition outlets which are located exactly above the chairs were patrons sit - bring a jacket
5
A colleague recommended this place so me and my friends tried it out a month ago or two. It looks like an old house from outside but once you enter it will really amaze you. Along the reception or entrance of the resto is a big wine cellar of maybe about 200 pure italian wines of good choices (seems they really choose their wines very well). They escorted us to the table and offered complimentary sparkling wine. The food menu is also purely italian. We tried their burrata with ham, seafood soup, cassoncelli & other pasta, scampi, pork jaw & 1 more main dish which i forgot the name - all I can say is "IT WAS THE BEST OF THE BEST". Service wise excellent. Very friendly & attentive staffs (not to mention the cute waitress). I will surely recommend this place to others. Kudos

My husband and I have spent the last several years in asia and dine out every day for dinner. It is the same rigmarole for us on most days in Singapore. The experience as a whole was one to remember. Gabriele and his team’s service was impeccable and not to mention, the food and wine. Just before our meal began, we were each served a glass of Italian sparkling wine and Oysters, with compliments from the sommelier and chef. I was stirred towards the veal tongue by the waiter that had taken my order. The unusual dish, turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Soft in the middle and crispy on the outside, the accompanying green sauce was a perfect match. Pasta was on my to try list, and I decided on the special Tagliatelle with white truffles. It was a simple and delicate dish which I had with 4grams of truffle. I ended my dinner with the Tasmanian Beef Tenderloin served with porcini mushrooms, leaving me no room for dessert. The atmosphere was cosy but a tad bit too cold for my liking. $318 for a bottle of Barolo Sandrone 2008 was one that matched my main dish like the last piece to a puzzle. Once again, at the end of our meal limoncello and petit four’s were served with compliments. We enjoyed the dinner thoroughly hence this is the first written review to thank them for a memorable evening

The risotto was the worst i have ever had. i like al dente but it was uncooked and had no flavour at all. probably poor stock and not enough cheese, done in a hurry!Iberico pork cheek from spain was dried up and cold. Probably kept in freezer too long!!!Wines are overpriced, 4X markup.Narrow and very uncomfortable

interesting restaurant, good location, easy parking, middling service ranging from very attentive to slightly forgotten. Good wine list including some good supertuscans to choose from. The food- presentation was ok, taste just ok. Too much water in the tomato based pasta, everything tasted watery. The carbonara and the pork jaw were good though. Deserts were average. The octopus salad was a sad and watery one. If you are going to put cucumber in a salad, please dehydrate is a little first.I am always sadder with bad meat than with bad vegetables. I guess because first we kill the animal and then we dishonour it by cooking it badly.Sorry, if you are looking for gushing reviews, then you wont find it here. One of the sad things about modern times is that more and more people work more and more hours and have less and less time to cook real food. This impacts their ability to understand and appreciate real food or the subtle nuances that distinguish very good from mediocre. That is why we see a surfeit of gushing reviews in every website; hold on to those stars folks and dont give them away so easily.Overall, this restaurant was a pleasant experience. Will i go back there? i think i will because i got the impression that this restaurant was serious about improving its food. And because it will not take too long for them to do so
