Was at the Tampines Mall branch just before 9am for a leisurely Singaporean style breakfast.
Kaya toast and Chee Cheong fun (rice rolls) were the order of the day. Not too bad and watch the world pass by.

If you are looking for good food for breakfast, lunch and dinner, this is one of the place I recommend. Price range is around SGD2 - SGD3 for coffee and toast. They serves chicken rendang, Mee Siam, Mee rebus, and laksa. These cost around SGD5. Today I personally loves their Singapore laksa. It taste so good. The noodle, the soup are well cook. Easy to find, it located at exit of City Hall mrt station. Very clean and comfortable place to dine. Very friendly staffs too.

Visited the outlet at Raffles Place after lunch. Must say this is a popular local coffee place amongst the people working in the area. To Ensure one gets a seat, should come before 12.30pm. The drinks here are nice and reasonably priced. However, it's not a good place for chit chat when it gets too crowded as it gets noisy

Came back here again last week for more tea and toast after lunch nearby. The venue has been recently renovated and now seems more popular, but still possible to get a table without too much difficulty. Tea and toast remains consistent and pretty much in line with what you would expect in any local cafe

Been to this outlet near the exit from Esplanade mrt a few times recently. It can get pretty busy at lunch time but otherwise it's usually not too bad and easy enough to get a seat. 2 teas and some toast for $5, so pretty good value
