Nice place to chill. Food is pretty good. Prawn balls, caesar salad with prawns, mushroom soup, deep fried mushrooms are highly recommended. Service is OK. Always seems to be plenty of Grab / Uber around.

It was hard to see this restaurant from the main road as it is hidden in the STC Riding Centre, facing the riding grounds. Although we visited in the evening, we could still see the display of horses and their riders. We enjoyed their fish and chips very much, the fish was of good quality with a well-done batter. Nothing like what I had ever eaten in Singapore. Will return again

WHO: Four 30-somethings looking for a place to chill in the North.We wanted a nice place to drink and dinner so one of us Googled this place out. Reviews there were quite even so we decided to give this place a try since it was near. Place was quite packed on the weekends when we arrived about 7-ish. Dinner crowd. The decor was updated, and everything overlooked the horsie place. I call it horsie place because I reckon that's where the horses hang out during the day. Since we were there at night, i believe they were asleep. There is nothing quite like this place in the North. Well, to the point: Beers were cheap (especially at Happy Hour!), food was well-portioned and delicious too. Servers were warm and attentive too. There is even a darts game thingy. Didn't try cos i don't see the point of darts. (Didn't realise I made a dart pun there.)If you're staying up north, or just lost some money at the races, maybe drop by here for a drink and some food to chill out or cheer yourself up
