Went on a Friday night, was a short line which required about a 15 minute wait.
Burgers and fries were nice, but they forgot to bring out the onion rings we ordered. Was kind of a blessing as we were too full after our meals.

Outstanding burgers. The burgers are nice and juicy. The bikini bottom burger (soft shell crab) is just delicious!
4
First visit here and the food was the best thing to be complimented here. We had the Bleu Peppercorn and Bikini Bottom burgers which is a must try however don't expect good waitering as I believe they're short on staff.

I've been to Fatboys Orchard and Holland Village before on multiple occasions and I've never had a bad burger. However, it is my opinion that the standards have dropped in this branch.My 'fat b@st@rd' burger's patty was totally dry and not juicy at all. Making it a huge pain to finish the whole thing. However, the Bleu Peppercorn that my SO ordered was much better prepared.Service was great and one wouldn't expect much of a bistro styled burger joint.
3
First off, service was good. Staff were really friendly. Service was also fast. But burger was rather disappointing. Portion size ... was big but taste was mehh. Had the portobello mushroom burger, bun was soggy n mushroom was tasteless. Friend had the peppercorn bleu cheese burger which was very dry. We shared the cheese sticks, which were quite good.

My kids dragged me here - when we vacation in Singapore I make it a point to eat at Singapore's renowned hawker stalls breakfast, lunch, dinner and anytime in between. But my kids raved about this place having been invited here by relatives a couple years back, so reluctantly, I decided to give it a shot and boy was I pleasantly impressed. What surprised me was that this restaurant is a Singapore original - i.e. It was not founded in the West. The quality and taste is comparable to many of the 'gourmet'/specialty burger joints in the US. The hamburger patty is made fresh and not from frozen, and so are all the other ingredients. I ordered the Fat Basterd, likely their biggest and baddest burger which comes with two good size juicy beef patties, loaded with bacon strips, cheese, a fried sunny side up egg, lettuce and tomatoes, topped with BBQ sauce, sandwiches between sesame buns. It was huge, it was messy, o yeah, egg yoke and sauce running all over, but it was soooooo good. I must have used up a dozen napkins - I was a mess but I was fully satisfied.So if you are looking for high quality, tasty burgers in Singapore and do not want to eat run off the mill burgers from the 'clown' nor the 'king', this is the place to come

Visited the outlet at pasir panjang, which is air-conditioned too, just opposite pasir panjang mrt station. Place was pretty empty for dinner on a friday night when we came in around 6pm, not fully packed by the time we left around 7.30pm too.Malt vanilla milkshake ($8.80) with additional Nutella ($1) was pretty amazing, rich vanilla taste with a faint nutella essence inside. Not the best we ever had but still quite promising.Jalapeño Poppers ($10) side dish came a little plain and boring. Only 8 pieces of poppers served with a sweet sauce (possibly a mix is thousand island and something else?), cream cheese filling too much to the ratio of jalapeno. Tastes TOO cheesy and not spicy at all. Crust was good though, crisp and crunchy.Bikini Bottom Burger ($18) came medium as well, beef patty was cooked delicious too. Soft shell crab doesn't taste greasy but had a slight fishy taste (not very bad but can be improved with seasoning). Salted egg yolk taste is practically missing, couldn't taste at all from the watery yellow sauce. Bleu peppercorn burger ($13) came medium, beef patty was cooked perfectly - juicy and moist. Blue cheese sauce couldn't taste much, too mild. Expected the burgers to be bigger cos fatboys yeah but the burgers were sadly just normal size. All burgers came with lettuce and tomato served separately from the burger itself as well as fries that were pretty great! Crispy till the end. Total bill $53.10 with gst but no service charge. Quite pricey for just burgers, especially the jalapeño poppers that costed $10 for just 8 little pieces! Overall tasty burger but the special sauces or sides can be improve

Four of us visited during our holiday, great food, we ordered -2 x Fat B£$%^&D burgersSwiss Shroom.Mac/Cheese.Great serviceReasonable Price for the meal.Very Tasty Food.Close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station.If you like burgers i would highly recommend this restaurant
2
when you approach the menù, you feel like it would be delicious and creative since you can also personalize your own burger. but when you taste it...... the worst hamburger ever eaten, and we picked the chicken!!!! that should be the easiest meat( in terms of quality standards ). it was fat, not healthy and disgusting.it'a pity because the location along the main shopping street, Orchard road, and the kind waitress could deserve a better food!2 burgers ( chips included )+1 orange juice+1 coca cola+1 mineral water: 36.15 SG

I have always been wanting to try this burger joint after hearing all the good reviews from my friends, and indeed, I didn't regret doing so!Basically, you get to choose your burger, and then your fries, so we ordered the Yolo Burger with Parmesan Truffle Fries and the Wimpy Burger with Beef Chili Fries. Both were really tasty and rich in flavours, and the meat patties were succulent. The portion was just right too, and it kept me full for the rest of the night. Prices were affordable too (around $15-25ish), although the service could be a little faster. Otherwise, I love this place, and would definitely come back for more, and to get fat here
5
Great tasty huge! burgers and satisfying sides. Chilled atmosphere and good service. Would absolutely recommend to burger lovers.
4
Good burgers next to plaza Singapura and close to MRT station. Large selection and friendly staff. Also rather fast service.
5
You can't go wrong here..it's all in at Fat Boy's Burger Bar...beer, good burgers to match and just a very good meal when you need a good burger down the belly.
4
On Friday afternoon we went for dinner. Burgers were yummy! We were pleased that tv was not on and music not too loud; good vibe!
4
Offering a good selection of delicious burgers, including vegetarian ones. This is one of the best places for reasonably priced burgers.
4
we went to the outlet at Thomson Road. service staff were friendly. different variety of burgers. we tried the Swiss Shroom and Wimpy burgers with chicken wing & beer. excellent food quality.
5
I have been to the holland village branch and the one at dhoby, their pork burger has to be the best burger i have ever had. You get to build your own burger as well.
4
Sometimes in Singapore you crave comfort food and we visited fat boys for the first time. The burgers are a great size deliciously juicy and perfectly done great fries a jug of beer nice diner style place. It's popular I had to queue to get in but absolutely worth it.
4
Hung out with my friends in this cafe and i have to say that the food is reasonably priced and the ambiance is very suitable for a gathering with a group of your friends. Fries are soft and warm, one of the best I've tried in cafes
5
~went twice to the Orchard Road outlet in a week after Foong Chee recommended it, second time with my kids back in 2015Oct-Wimpy Pork - Juicy YUMz-Wimpy Beef - delicious-Country Fried Steak - super thin meat-Philly Cheese Steak - oh so yummy melted cheese-Bacon Cheese Fries - salty-Truffle Fries - fragrant YUMz-DIY Burger - yes you gotta do it more than once to get it rightGreat place for burger

The Restaurant serves all different range of burger, the place is must try burger lover. They also serves draft beer with reasonable prices.
4
Place was pleasant with typical Americana decor. Food was hit and tasty with the biggest burger being BIG. I'm told that a burger needs to be juicy and these were very juicy....so of you are a burger fan, this chain restaurant is good for you.
5
I've been to Fatboys many times and every time they never cease to amaze me with their burgers and their willingness to customise them for me. Great taste!!!!
3
Good place for hangout and chit chat. Beef is fresh, tender and juicy. Definitely much above fast food burger.
4
The burger is awesome and I usually have the black paper burger without the blue cheese sauce I like it very much. I tried their malt shake and it was great. I'll come back for sure.
I visited their other branch at 38 orchard road
5
I am not a fans or burger, because in my mind keep thinking that burger always comes with small-tiny-cute burger and double tender small-tiny-cute burger bun like at most american fastfood. But love Fatboys burger. So creamy cruncy and thick burger with a high level of taste. My kid loved as well. French fries was so thick and long. Compare with McD?. McD is nothing LoL. Been about 4 times at Pasir Panjang Branch. "Think about burger?. Remember Fatboys". I wish i could gain weight of it, but i couldnt. I think i need to stop by again soon !!!

Even though Fat Boys has been around in Singapore for quite a while, I've never been to one. But one weekday night I decided to give it a go. They offer western comfort food, like greasy burgers, artery clogging mac and cheese, chili cheese fries, milk shakes etc.They also offer customization of burgers, so you get to pick your veg, meat, egg, sauces and even buns. You could pretty much create a mega upsized burger with all forms of protein and dairy products, as long as your wallet was okay with it.Most burgers are priced around $13-$18++, you can top up $2.50++ for truffle Parmesan fries or chili cheese fries. Just top up and you won't regret it. Totally worth the extra time in the gym and money!So here was our feast for 3 pax, 2 hungry adult males and I! It was way too much food. I could sense food coma approaching as I looked at the table!1. Shrooms Burger $13++ + $2.50 for chili cheese frieslove mushrooms and the mushrooms here were quite generous. The burger bun was fluffy and slighly crispy on the edges, but as time went by, it became a soggy burger bun. The onions weren't very flavourful but rather, they were quite oily. Nonetheless, the onions brought out the flavour of the juicy mushrooms.I loved the melted cheese. It was perfect for the thick beef patty. I really liked this combination and for the price. I felt that it was pretty decent. The chili fries weren't as good as I had remembered. But the fries were crisp all the way.2. DIY Burger + $2.50 for truffle friesAt Fay Boys you get to customize your burger. For this baby, we haveHoney Oat bun $2 with1. Beef Patty $92. Bacon $2.503. Sauteed Shitake Mushroom $24. Swiss Cheese $1.805. Fried Egg $1.506. Fried Onion Rings $1.507. Garlic Aioli $0.80Total $21.10++It is a pretty pricey burger but it has everything that I want on a burger, no veggies! The burger came pretty quickly and sadly I didn't get the honour of bursting the runny egg yolk. The garlic aioli sauce was addictive and it really gave everything in the burger the same flavour.3. Chicken waffle sandwich $15.50++Another sinful main course, chicken cutlet sandwiched between cheese underneath a buttermilk waffle. The chicken cutlet was pretty thin despite it's length, but it was crispy and breaded. The waffle was quite tasteless despite it's colour. The mash potatoes were strangely cold but tasty.4. Onion RingsI loved these onion rings mainly due to the batter they used. It was fragrant and very crispy. It wasn't doughy at all. The onion rings were huge in diameter and they tasted great with the bbq sauce.5. CalamariThe calamari was abit too chewy for my liking. But the wasabi mayo was it's saving grace. Definitely preferred the onion rings over the calamari.Overall : Decent burgers with quick and friendly service. Just skip the sides
4
Ordered the salmon set with mashed potatoes, which was replaced with fries as they were out of stock for mashed potatoes. Service was prompt. Just one thing, I hope they can improve the taste of the truffle fries. It tasted just like normal fries. Price is a little steep as well
2
Not sure how they did it but they were able to serve the burgers very quickly, the meat was not hot.. only warmish and very greasy but precooked I think. When I sent the food back they pulled it all apart, burnt it on the flattop stove or in a pan and then put it all back together again. I noticed everyone was getting their food very quickly when they sat down though, wonder if the food was as bad as ours was. Had a pitcher of beer as well. slightly flat and didn't taste good ( Stella ). Think the beer lines needed cleaning. Waitstaff were despondent probably because they don't work for tips ( Singapore ) and you needed to almost throw yourself in front of the waiter just to get service. We ate on a Sunday afternoon at 1 pm . Would never recommend going there. Potato head in Singapore is amazing though

I visited the Orchard Road location. My service and burger were very good. I had the beef burger with shiitake mushrooms and Swiss cheese. There are other items on the menu but burgers are the specialty. They have many different burgers on the menu as well as the option to customize your own. I would like to check out the pork burger next. They have a bar. Liquor and beer. No wifi. Very busy during the day.

Management of this outlet is horrible! Came with a group of 10 friends and after 50 minutes of wait, we finally received our meal! Wow will definitely not come back here anymore! Keep up the good work
5
If you feel like a good burger try this place! They have a huge selection and the cheese and bacon fries are great. I'm not usually a fan of burgers but these were different, large portions with bacon, nice cheese and quality rolls.
5
I personally had the Wimpy Beef Burger, one of their signature dishes on their menu. It was really flavourful.
4
The wasabi sauce that comes with the calamari is very 'powerful'. Really clears the nostrils. Ordered the Bushtacker. I would say that the portion is decent (I was expecting huger portions actually). The beef tastes fresh and sweet. Fries is so so. Nothing special. Plain water is self service and free flow. Service staff were helpful and quick to respond.
1
My friend and I visited the outlet at Holland Village last Thursday for the first time at 630 pm. The mashed potato with my low quality salmon was cold and obviously whipped from powder! And the french fries was hard and stale. And worse of all, the waitress couldn't wait to get rid of us because she checked with us 3x if she could clear our plates! There was still food on the plates. It's just that we had stopped a while to talk without our mouths full. Will never go back to the restaurant
5
Created my own burger with exactly what I love and no extra stuff that I don't usually like that normally comes on a burger. Absolutely sensational. Lucky to get a table. If you know your burgers you would probably agree this is one of the places right on top of your lists. The variety and possibilities is mind boggling

Firstly, I think the burgers are decent considering the price range. But twice in my recent visits to the outlet at Upper Thomson and Dhoby Ghaut, I've encountered horrible service. At both outlets, don't bother expecting any acknowledgement from staff when you stand at the entrance waiting to be served (take note both occasions there was no one in the queue but 2 of us). The nearest staff will take a quick glance at you with no direct eye contact, look back into the store and spot a empty seat before turning back in your direction to give a reluctant gesture of motion of their head for you to come in (again, no eye contact). And every time you call for their attention after waiting patiently for someone to respond to your wave, they will respond by telling you they need to get something else done first. Even after waiting God knows how long to get someone's attention to get the bill, they still insist on clearing your table before getting the bill. When they come with they bill, they don't say a word - just leave the bill folder on your table and walk off without even a glance at you. I finally walked up to the cashier myself after waiting another 10 minutes just to get them to pick it up with my credit card. What sealed my horrible deal with Fat Boys at Dhoby Ghaut was when the staff returned my credit card wrapped in my receipt by shoving it in my face (literally), she came from behind and held her hand literally 2-3 inches from my face with my card. And she wasn't even looking at me, she was serving another table with her other hand. Is this how I should have my credit card returned to me after I walked up to the cashier to make payment and paying for GST and service charge?Honestly, if the wait staff at Fat Boys hate the crowd and the job so much, please quit. Stop ruining the reputation of a good establishment serving good burgers. If you hate working in F&B, please quit, don't let your unhappiness overflow onto your customers who were looking forward to a great weekend dinner. And if this culture is inculcated by the management, then I suggest diners please think twice about spending your precious money on GST and service charge at Fat Boys. Stop tainting the service culture in Singapore and bringing down the standards of the industry

I have visited the Fatboy's restaurant in Orchard Road, near Plaza Singapore. While the food was good enough, at least what I was able to try, the service is terrible and substandardized.We ordered starters and main course. Starters and my wife's meal was served within 20 minutes. However, after 40 minutes waiting I remained unserved. This is totaly unacceptable, specially if you take into account that the restaurant was almost empty (only 3 busy tables) and the rest of the customers were all set. There were at least 6 staff members doing basically nothing, laughing and fooling around the bar while I was waiting to get my food. No need to say I asked for the bill and I walked out. No one apologized and no one gave me any explanation.Seriously, hawker centers provide better service than this Fatboy's joint
4
It was my second time here at the flagship outlet along Upper Thomson Road. I ordered Pizza The Hut and again, I was pleased with the serving of the burger. However, the fries is a little over fried and the presentation of food is mixed up where the burger is placed in front of the fries. Overall, the food quality is good. You might need to wait for half an hour to get a seat if you are coming in a big group
4
Located at Upper Thomson Road, this restaurant serves burgers as a specialty where you can either choose from the menu, or mix and match to make your own burger to suit your taste! I ordered Wimpy Beef which has a beef chuck patty, chewy bacon, cheddar cheese, a fried egg with BBQ Sauce and fries. The burger is good but the fries were slightly over-fried
4
Cool burger joint in front of i12 Katong. The wimpy burger and the thick Vanilla milkshake was good. Decently priced and goo decor, a must try if you love an occasional unhealthy burger.
5
Had a great meal here while staying with a friend in Singapore.
The Burgers were absolutely delicious and it was hard to choose, when looking at the menu!
Lovely service and a must-eat when you love burgers.
Nothing like the sloppy fastfood franchise burgers.
5
The burgers here are tasty and made well! Excellent value for money! Love the outlet at Katong for a chilled out evening!

When heard of this burger restaurant,we expect something look/taste more better than those fastfood burgers.But what we agree with some reviewers comment.Burgers is enough to fill you up but not make you addict to it.Service is like uncle or auntie in coffeeshop style.And is a non aircon restaurant (upp.thomson branch).Parking is a headache,one way narrow road,but free
3
We had the Wimpy, the Royale with Cheese, and Disco Fries.1. The Wimpy: either the bun was too soft or too much sauce. The meat did taste like beef but not beefy enough to my liking. Overall score: 5.62. The Royal with Cheese: it's better than the Wimpy. The buns did not fall apart and the meat tasted "normal". Overall score: 73. Disco fries: bad. It's just Fries in gravy and cheese. Score: 2I'm not a fan

This place fails on the basic elements that make a good burger. 1) The Wimpy burger meat pattie was not good quality and had a sponge-like consistency. Rather than allowing the natural flavour of the beef to come through there were unnecessary seasonings added, I suspect this was to disguise the poor quality of the meat or added filler. The end result was a pattie with an unusual texture that did not have a pleasant taste.2) The second major failure is the bun. The normal white bun was not available so wholemeal was offered as a substitute. Whilst I can accept that they ran out, no self-respecting burger joint should serve wholemeal buns. Period. The consistency of the bun was completely wrong, was airy and dry and tasted like cheap long life burger buns you might buy from a supermarket.All the other gimmicky burgers on the menu simply try to compensate for the fact that the basic burger elements are not up to scratch. Would recommend the owners/franchisee's try Omakase burger to understand how to do a burger right. Also see Byron burger in the UK or In'n'Out in the US.The Fatboy burger is quite possibly the worst burger I've had

This review is for the Fatboys outlet on Orchard Road, nearby to Plaza Singapura.My friend was having a craving for their Wimpy burger and I had never tried Fatboys before so we settled on this place for dinner. On a weekday night the outlet is full but not packed and you can still enjoy a nice dinner without feeling rushed. Bonus points for the fifties/sixties style music that they played and the cool decor.I had the chicken mac'n'cheese and it was nice, but not cheesy enough for me. But that being said, I do like my cheese in (over)abundance so the amount of cheese sauce might be just right for another. The highlight of dinner however, was their beer battered onion rings. At $7.50, this was really value for money! I wasn't expecting much but when the waiter set the plate of onion rings down in front of me, I was startled to see the size - each onion ring was easily the size of my palm. Extremely yummy too.I was told that the prices of the Burger Bar are slightly cheaper, but you are paying for the sitdown service here, I expect
5
Loved the food; the onion rings and the Chilli they served with Nachos were outstanding, the bacon wrapped sausages & burgers themselves were pretty good!The music was a tad too loud & the beer was a tad less chilled but the ambience was buzzy and the service was friendly! Similar in all manners to the Joo Chiat outlet including the lame fries somehow they can't get over that!

Snuggled in a tiny corner of Joo Chiat Road opposite the Katong 112 shopping mall is Fatboys the Burger Bar, which serves up burgers with a twist: its a burger joint, its a bar, its... a burger place where you can customize your own burger from a list of buns, patties, cheeses, add-ons and sauces all in the comfort of a 'happening' environment. Besides burgers, Fatboys the Burger Bar also has other comfort foods such as onion rings, milk shakes etc... All in the comfort of a cosy pub/diner environment.Service was acceptable, Singapore-style that is. It did take some effort to get them to notice us for an additional order, but other than that orders were taken down promptly. Food was served in a relative fast time and payment was a breeze. Price and taste wise, Fatboys the Burger Bar nicely covers the segment that upmarket artisan burgers and fast food miss. The prices aren't (as) cheap as fast food but definitely more affordable than the arty burgers, and mostly certainly very filling (and tasty too)! We almost could hardly finish the Beer Battered Onions Rings and burgers, along with the milksakes and my root beer float

I had a gathering here with my old camp mates. This place is chic and cosy for a start. We were seated on a long table for more than ten. They offer burgers with a twist here and seriously, they are much better than those burgers that come out of conveyor belts. Interesting menu with many different options and not forgetting meat balls and chicken wings too.This place serves their food just like American restaurants do, BIG... So one burger alone will fill up a grown man'a stomach easily.Overall, a nice place to hangout and dine the classic American way:
