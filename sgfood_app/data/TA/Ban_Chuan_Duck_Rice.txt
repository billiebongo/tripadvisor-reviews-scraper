My family and I enjoyed the braised duck rice sold by this stall. The food is tasty and the price is very reasonable. Highly recommended for braised duck lovers!

Not sure why this is in Trip Advisory in the 1st place and there is no review on it, the place is located in the local hawker center, normal quality food

It's a stall located at a non aircon hawker centre in Ang Mo Kio Town Centre, 8 minutes walk from Ang Mo Kio MRT station. Fortunately, there was no queue today. Just waited 2 minutes (usually about 10-15 minutes) I got my plate of braised duck rice with peanuts at $3. All self service, no waiter. Simple & tasty dinner. Enjoyed the plate of duck rice with fresh sugar cane juice ($1.30). Value for money
