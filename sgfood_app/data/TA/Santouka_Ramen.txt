The ramen broth is rich and scrumptious, the star here is the Pork Cheek.
A worth visit when you are in Singapore

Self-styled Hokkaido ramen joint. Specialty is the pork cheek. Portions are generous and their set meals are pretty reasonable. But the noodles were overcooked and the soup was very salty and lacking depth.
Service was very efficient and polite.
5
Worth the price you pay at such a location in Singapore. Comfortable location for a chat during lunchtime!
4
Fast and friend service. Ramen is al dente. Soup is delicious and not too salty unlike most places. Pork cheek slices are so tender, generous portion, thick slices and very tasty! Such an enjoyable dinner for this first time customers. We'll be back again.
4
Ramen was cooked well. Soup is definitely one of the better ones in Singapore, but not the best (IMHO). Paired by meal with a Daiginjo Sake, which was good! Would visit again.

my number 1 choice for ramen in singapore! compared to the other popular chains, santouka tends to be a little lighter (very much less oily) but still flavourful. tried their very first flagship store in asahikawa, hokkaido and i can say that the taste they've achieved in SG is pretty authentic!Other than ramen, their gyoza is pretty good too

So I've been to Japan several times. To be honest, I don't know what the fuss some patrons have about space and the staff. There is plenty of space - compared to most Ramen restaurants in Japan - even in Ganso Ramen Alley in Sapporo. Right, I'm sorry, we're in Singapore and we need plenty of personal space when eating, even if we're there for the Jap stuff. Honestly, to me it isn't as big a deal if the company's good. Cutting to the ramen: my friend had the Spicy Shio Ramen, while I had the Awase-aji Ramen (soup base mixture of shio, shoyu, and miso), both with cha shu. Ramen broth tends to vary in salt content - but is still considered very salty even if it's supposedly mild - even in Japan depending on which region you're in. If you're not really into salty stuff, plain shio ramen usually (in my opinion) isn't as salty as miso or shoyu and is lighter on the palate.While my friend found the spicy shio's broth salty (possibly due to the added spices), my Awase-aji's broth was good. Not too light, but just enough taste and texture to tease my palate. The ramen and the cha shu, however, were just slightly overcooked, but still went well with the soup and spring onion garnishing, and the complimentary kimchi they served. But please, please be kind to the staff. Some may be new on the job, or may be special needs persons. Be nice to them, yeah? I don't have a photo because I was there to eat not to Instagram my ramen

In between classes and needed a quick lunch. Restaurant just opened and the waiter was a bit over personal. Finally got the menues and tried to order. The items we wanted were out of stock, and instead of allowing us to order alternative items, the waiter insisted on telling us this long elaborated story on why the items were not available [I didn't care, just wanted to order]...we then made a second attempt to order, and he then wanted to discuss the specials; the ordering experience was exhausting. Food however was very good. Very skimpy on the meat for the price, but I'd recommend ordering the pork cheek as an additional extra. Very good.

.Visited twice.Sat outside on both occasions.All their tables are tightly spaced.Their al fresco area is a REDUCED SIZE compared to adjacent outlets.The seating is even more compacted indoors, and the air-con very weak.Both visits .. only 10-20% of seats occupied.I had the Pork Cheek Ramen.It was DECENT. Nothing wow .. nothing memorable.Service was FUNCTIONAL on BOTH visits .. that means they take your orders, bring you your food, settle your bill. Off you go !

Dined there last night and it was quite packed. Had to share a table with a couple. Food wise though I would say does not offer as many ramen items on the menu as compared to other ramen places. Tried the shoyu ramen and it comes with bamboo shoots, leek, nori and chashu. Add ons for ramen egg costs $1.50. Still, for the price paid, can't expect much. Portion wise for me was a little small. Plus point is they give a jug of water for every group of diners
4
The Kara-miso roasted pork cheek tokusen toroniku ramen was chilly and refreshing (maybe a tad too chilly, but great). The Katsu curry was also special. :)
4
Great ramen, tried the shoyu ramen set with chicken Karaage.
All delicious and gyoza was nice too.
Close to Orchard Rd
4
Food was good, service staff friendly and helpful but getting there attention was a nightmare, they were too busy and not enough staff. It's. Disappointment to what was otherwise a lovely meal.
3
Overall nice ramen. A cool place to have lunch in Cuppage area. They have good selection in the menu. We had Shio ramen and awase-Aji ramen. A bit salty but tasty.
5
It used to have brach in Jakarta. But not anymore. I love the noodle very much because it's a lil bit stiff and curly. The soup was tasty. And the pork cheek is really the hero. My wife crazy about it so much.
3
We ordered a Shio and a Shoyu ramen. Both we felt were too oily to eat. The 'belly' charsiew was hard to digest despite the full fragrant of Ibrico pork. Not the type we like under the hot weather.
4
I was pleasantly surprised by this Ramen shop which is a five minuter walk from my office. My wife and I both ordered a small bowl (not always available elsewhere) of ramen which although a little salty was still a good portion. The tongkatsu was soft and well cooked.The service was slick and friendly.All in all a good lunch although a little on the expensive side
3
Passed by Cuppage on the way to Orchard Central and chanced upon this place. Kids are fond of Ramen so they insisted we have lunch there. The Shio stock was not bad, though wife commented it was a bit on the salty side (I didn't mind). The parent/child set was a nice touch and the Iberico Gyoza were quite good. The Salmon salad was also nice, with a mild kick (didn't know it had Wasabi)The place although cramped, was alright. At least that's how I remember some neighbourhood Ramen places in Japan a few yeaes backIn the end, I still prefer the subtle flavour of the soup from Marutama (less popular Ramen place), as well as their firm noodles. But these days, it seems they are getting less and less popular though, hence harder to fin

I chanced upon this in Cuppage & decided to have ramen for supper. It's Vancouver serves the most delicious miso ramen which till this day, still brings back fond memories. My expectations were set.Service was prompt, didn't have to wait beyond 5 minutes for my orders to arrive. The broth was creamy & fairly tasty. I love the creamy, orange liquid egg yolk. Portioning can be more generous. The set came with a small bowl of rice which was almost cooled to room temperature so that didn't impress. The restaurant feels like an oven with too many bright downlights, poor air conditioning & poor air circulation. This is definitely a mood damper, the discomfort pushes me to eat & run in a hurry.
4
the ramen here was great. Not the best I have ever had, but by all means it was very good. It was a great find, and is a little difficult to find, but when you do it's worth it. It is definitely on my list of places to return to on my next trip.

I took the ramen and ice cream for dessert. Really good and tasty for the price you paid.

Really delicious. Very rich and tasty broth. The Iberian pork cheeks are sinful!!! I have been many times now and was never disappointed!
4
Nice ambience. Even though the place is small but the indoor ventilation is better than expected. Services staff are friendly.
4
i love the iberico pork cheek ramen, perfectly marinated and grilled to melt in your mouth... served with good comforting broth completed with an onsen egg (add-on, with additional cost), this is my comfort food.
5
The iberico pork cheek ramen was the best i had in Singapore so far. The meat was tender and cooked to melt in your mouth.
3
My title kinda sums it up. It's tasty but it's too salty. That ruined the deliciousness. Yes I know some will argue that "Japanese ramen is supposed to be salty" or "it's like that in Japan too". But I've eaten Hokkaido ramen in Hokkaido, it's not that salty... Ok some others will argue "it's a different style!" But still, too salty. When food is too salty, you can't taste it or enjoy it well. It's tasty but too salty. Service ain't great. Manned by a few aunties. I would just say, feels like eating in a food court. Those who've experienced Japanese hospitality will understand the stark difference. Would I be back? I would just say, there are other ramen shops I prefer. It's a matter of preference.

This is my second time to this restaurant, the first being a couple of years ago.I ordered the pork belly chashu shiyo ramen whilst my husband had the miso soup version. My children had the downsized (less $2 each) chashu shiyo ramen as well. In addition, we ordered the ebi and tori kaarage.The ramen was excellent, the noodles were smooth and the broth was not too salty nor oily. The portions were great, not cloyingly huge, so it was a satisfying meal. I also like it that the restaurant gave the downsize option, which was excellent for small eaters like my children who were too old for the child's meal but yet could not finish an adult portion on their own. The ebi karaage was good, it came freshly cooked and was very crispy. However, for the tori karaage, although the meat inside was moist and tender, I felt that the skin was a bit overfried, it was dark and a bit hard. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. Indoor is rather tight, I sat literally side by side with the couple at the next table, their table was only pushed away from mine by less than 5cm. The chair that I sat on was unusual, with only one arm rest on one side, so it was rather odd being able to rest one arm on the rest and the other on my lap, for the lack of the better place. As I am not a petite person, I also found the chair a bit small to be comfortable. Service was good, the staff were generally very responsive except for once when I had to ask for help in topping up my water cup. They even encouraged me to eat the leftover vegetables on the plate before they cleared it. I do find the pricing a bit high though. For 2 regular ramen (my shiyo ramen was $17 alone), 2 downsized ramen, 2 eggs, 1 ebi karaage and 1 tori karaage, the bill came up to $90, considering we didn't order any drinks and only had plain water.I would come back to this restaurant again

I visited this place at 2 p.m. yesterday. My order was Iberico buta ramen with soya soup. Soup : very rich and tasty Pork : super tender and yummyNoodle : very bouncy This place is the best Ramen in Singapore to me. The best for me which compared to other ramen places called Ramen Play, Ramen Monsters, Tonkotsu Kansan and Nantsuttei. None of them match the quality and taste to Santouka. The let's down was the shop was too hot. It was only fan turn on yesterday. I was swet like a pig while having the hot soup. The Service was not very attentive or friendly.
5
~2nd time here in a few years, I distinctly remember the grilled pork cheek served in a square dish, my wife & I dropping in after a short walk along Cuppage Terrace :)~2 boys were happily touting outside (somewhat friendly), at the least more welcoming than the standoffish girls of Harry's the pub in front of Hokkaido Ramen Santouka~we were seated just inside the sliding glass doors which was the warmest location but it was packed for dinner so we didn't complain~there was a huge jug of iced water already on the table which I've only seen at very few enlightened eateries :)Here's what we ordered~New Small Ramen & Char Siu Rice Bowl Set (Shio-Salt): a truly flavorful dish of ramen that impressed me, as well as a great bowl of Char Siu Rice YUMz~Iberian Pork Tonkatsu Curry Rice with Salad: a thick moist juicy slab of pork that did not agree with me as I was more used to dry white rough loin meats. We packed this to go for $1 more~Iberian Pork Toroniku ala carte: OMG this was simply a meltful slice of delicious pork YUMzWe'd definitely be back, checkout some photos I posted, cheer

Went there for a late lunch at around 1.30pm and met up with some office crowd.The tables seem tighter than at Central and there isn't the river view like the other outlet.However, the staff here are more personal. Being aunties, as opposed to the younger staff at the other outlet, the waitresses were very observant to look out for our baby and helped out with the baby chair.Another good thing was the drink dispenser which I happily helped myself to cold soya milk.The food at Santouka will always be awesome to me as they have found the best soup broth and offers the best pork cheeks in Singapore!Absolute must try though it might be pricier than the average ramen restaurant
5
Love the ramen here! Must try! The side dish was delicious too! Will go to this place again for sure!
5
Pork cheeks melt in your mouth! It's highly recommended. The salad is refreshingly good as well. Staff are efficient and friendly. Highly recommended - good quality soup base and those eggs - another must try!
5
Have eaten here many times over the years. Its always good (both the one at Cuppage and Central). In fact it seems to be getting better I think. Service seems to have improved and the food is getting more consistent. Keep it up!
4
Some friends and I stopped in for a beer here which was cheaper ($10) for authentic Japanese beer than the surrounding area where a glass of Heineken ran for about $16.The staff is very friendly, talkative and helpful.We also ordered chicken gyoza ($6) which was above average quality, and edamame ($5) which was a bit overcooked.Stop here if you're looking for decently priced drinks and some grub, but there are probably better (and worse) deals out there if you're not craving Japanese
4
Food here (and their other outlet at Central in Clarke Quay) is always consistent. We were here for dinner on a Sunday night and there was a line to get in. Noodles are springy, broth is tasty, stewed eggs have a nice yolk that's not too runny and their signature pork cheek is divine.
3
Miso Ramen was nothing to shout about. Both noodles and broth were average. He the pork cheeks however were divine. S must if eating there. During happy hours which run from 2100 to 2300, beers are practically half priced. There is a good selection of japanese craft beers here.

I have heard some good things about its well-raved pork cheeks ramen, hence it piqued my curiosity. So, upon stepping into the quaint little Japanese ramen restaurant in Cuppage Terrace, I knew what I wanted before the waiters came with the menu. It was claimed to be "very valuable parts, only 200 - 300g entire pig" and "served daily in limited quantity".So I had the Roasted Pork Cheeks Ramen (SGD$21.00 for small portion) with Kara-Miso (spicy) soup base. There was an additional SGD$1.00 charge for the spicy soup base.This spicy soup base was a little more spicy than I remembered since my last visit (albeit at another branch), but it suited me better. It was thick and flavorful. The ramen noodles were springy but rather nondescript, similar to the Chinese yellow thick noodles.The pork cheeks came with bamboo shoots, chives and black fungus strips, all of which I deposited into the noodle soup together with my Komi Tamago (flavored / braised egg at SGD$1.50). The pork cheek slices were smooth and tender, rich in texture but light in flavor. It was good, and the pork slices were thick enough to give a very good "mouth-feel" (known was "kou gan" in Chinese), simply to say, the palate agrees!For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/04/lunch-at-santouka-ramen-cuppage-terrace.htm

We visited this Japanese restaurant in Cuppage for the first time. The food was great and a lot of variety on the menu. We liked the set menu deals and were very happy with the food. Excellent fast service and friendly staff.BUT the seats were SO uncomfortable that we left with pain in our lower backs. We sat inside the restaurant indoors near the window on the bench style seat which strangely was slightly sloped down so we kept slipping off the seat. There is a lack of space in the restaurant overall as the tables are too close together. It is just so uncomfortable!!It is important for seats in a restaurant to be comfortable to contribute to the enjoyment of dining. If they provide a takeaway service we would buy takeaway food from them as the food was good but we would never go back to sit and eat in this restaurant again
3
After hearing so much about this place, finally managed to convince my regular group of friends to head over to Cuppage. Waiting time was reasonable for a place which is well known. Tried their tonkotsu char siew, which was good. The soup was thick and tasty (might be salty to some), the ramen just the right texture and the char siew was tender and tasty. However, must add that it certainly wasn't the best ramen I've tasted. Perhaps I was just expecting too much-:

We were at the Centrepoint – Orchard Road area and looking for a place to dine for lunch.We walked past the Cuppage Terrace and came across a ‘1 for 1’ deal for ramen and their set lunches. We decided to go with the ‘1 for 1’ deal for their set lunches. The set lunches have a total of 8 options:- Chicken Karaage- Deep fried Prawns- Deep fried Prawn and Fried Salmon- GyozaFor each of the above, you get a choice of:- Rice ball wrapped in sweet tofu skin or - Salmon rice ball with seaweed.In addition, each set comes with a bowl of ramen. You have a choice of flavours for your ramen soup base: Salt, Soy sauce, Miso or hot Miso. You can also upsize your noodles to medium size for an additional $1 or large for $3.As there were 4 of us, we ordered 1 each for the sets available, and chose both the rice ball and salmon rice ball, so that we can try both.Here’s the verdict:- Chicken Karaage: The chicken pieces were quite large and deep fried to a dark brown. Chicken were juicy.- Deep fried Prawns: This is of the frozen kind. Nothing much to shout about. - Deep fried Prawn and Fried Salmon: Prawn as mentioned earlier. The salmon was rather dry for my liking.- Gyoza: 3 pieces of gyoza. It was ok. - Rice ball wrapped in sweet tofu skin: The tofu skin was sweet and this is eaten like a sushi.- Salmon rice ball with seaweed: cooked salmon that has been flaked and mixed into the Japanese rice together with furikake. It is pressed into a mould to ge the triangle shape and a piece of seaweed is placed on the outside. This was delicious and my lunch group loved it. Must try! - Ramen: Each of us ordered different soup base. I had the miso and it was just salty enough for me. Loved it.For 4 pax, we spent $45.Try it

After visiting many ramen outlets in Singapore, Santouka definitely works magic with their signature ramen and finally opened my tastebuds to good quality. Service was straightforward and quick. Had the price been less steep, I might just get addicted!
2
Came here for dinner after a very nice experience at Santouka in Vancouver. We were disappointed. Taste was so-so, and everything (ramen, side dishes) was too salty.
Will not return.
4
My tenth trip to Santouka and I love their Char Siew Fried Rice with pork cheek. I have also my favourite pork gyoza to go with my meal. Not a big fan of their ramen though. I prefer their fried rice and pork cheek best.
5
Enjoyed their shio ramen and pork cheek, the ala carte BBQ pork cheeks are much better than the set ones. For eggs, it is not very consistent every time we visit, sometimes just nice, sometimes overcooked, especially during weekends.Definitely the top ramen restaurant in Singapore nevertheless
3
The menu is interesting with lots of small bowls you can mix and match. My credit card offers 50% discount for the pork cheek ramen so we took that.We find the soup too salty. The pork cheek is nice. They were also generous with the portions.Will return to try the small bowls. Maybe they are better
5
I finally had a chance to try the noodles here, after hearing so much rave reviews on hungrygowhere. The branch at Central is particularly challenging to find, as it is hidden away in a corner, and you had to walk through a restaurant called Rendezvous Kitchen. But this restaurant is a gem, it's as though we have came across a little shop along the streets of Japan, and I'm so glad we came here. Together with my friend, we ordered a small ramen with salmon roe rice bowl set. The ramen soup is heavenly! Very smooth to drink, and very flavourful. Though we opted for the Shoyu style soup, it didn't taste very salty, which we could really enjoy the original soup taste. The salmon roe just pops into your mouth, while the cooked salmon tasted very fresh without the raw fish smell. My friend taught me to enjoy the salmon rice with the ramen soup, and sprinkle some chilli powder on it. It was awesome! The half-boiled egg was my favorite, and it went very well with the salmon rice too!I would definitely come here again
3
Service is fast and efficient.The choice of dishes is interesting, and although i have not tasted their ramen (elected the best last year), rice and roasted pork cheeks were good.It is located in a busy street among other restaurants, so it is easy to find. Can be busy at night
3
Went to the outlet in the Central Mall in Clark Quay. Came early on a Saturday so there was no need to line up. Had the Iberico Pork special ramen: generally too oily, although the Iberico Pork slices were good (expensive at $22 ++ each serve though, but fortunately there was a 1:1 promotion going). Not really sure why this place is so popular: on the way out at about 1pm there were around 15 people lined up to get in. There are better Ramen places in SIngapore
5
Went there during the 50% promotion at the Central Clarke Quay branch, each person pays about $13 for an excellent bowl of ramen with well marinated tender pork cheeks! Love the pork cheeks! Best in town! Nothing beats it. it is pricey when there isn't any promotion but well, there is always a promotion almost every month! The portion is great and soup is tasty
4
When I have the chance, I will like to have a bowl of ramen at the restaurant. This is one of my favourite ramen in Singapore.During my last visit, I had the shoyu ramen with the flavoured egg. It was still as good. The broth was tasty and the texture of the noddle was good. However, I still feel the price was above the average
5
This is the very best thing you'll find in SG, esp in orchard! I'll choose a full bowl of ramen there! So delicious! It's tasty! Spicy or not, stilll Tastyyyyy!
4
Fantastic ramen and pork cheeks. Try to get a table outside if you can, we felt a bit too cosy inside.
4
I would definitely recommend Santouka for Ramen in Singapore, I love their pork cheek and cha siew ramen. Both are delicious ! Egg is additional $1 but it must add :)
3
Heard some good reviews from friends, so decided to check it out. Seriously, the ramen is very average, I have been drinking water non stop since I came home, not sure if it's the salt or msg in the broth.Also this is probably the only restaurant that I know in Singapore who charges $1 for takeaways. I thought only hawker centre does that. If u really want good ramen, try Ippudo 
4
This is easily the best ramen shop that i have eaten at - and their pork cheeks are definitely to die for. The texture is soft and tender, and the flavours are just... wow. Certainly worth every single cent.The texture of the ramen noodles are great too. I love the springy texture, and at the same time, they're not overpoweringly eggy, unlike some other ramen I have eaten, so that's great too.The Shio soup base is my favourite. I like it, because it's not too rich and at the same time, packs a real punch in terms of flavour. Miso and Shoyu are just as good too.On my latest visit, I tried their cold ramen (Hiyasi Chuka) and it felt a little strange cause I'm not used to cold ramen noodles. But the taste was just as good as ever, and have I mentioned those pork cheeks...?For more in-depth review and to see great photos, check out my blog: http://www.prischew.com/food/best-japanese-ramen-ramen-santouka

I'm not a big fan of ramen. But the pork cheek, gyoza, kara miso ramen, shio ramen and miso ramen were gone within minutes it reached our table. The wait to be seated was more than half an hour but it was expected as the restaurant has limited seats within such a small space, and also the fact that we visited during lunch hours. Price-wise was okay, maybe a little over the average. Overall, nothing to rave about but nothing too bad about the food and service either
5
Tried this ramen based on my friend recommendation. Eventually, i regulary visited when i traveled to singapore. In peak time u need to queue, average need to wait about 10-15 minutes for small group. I loved the pork cheek ramen with shio soup. Very tasty, and forget about the price they charge. For noodle lovers, you can upsize the noodle. Free flow of mineral water. The gyoza was also good.Other menu, they have set of katsu, fried rice, and many more. Better to dine in clark quay branch, better service and taste. So for ramen lovers, dont miss it
1
Had shoyu cha shu ramen. The soup is oily and cha shu is tough and chewy. Ordered eggs and they are overcooked. Prc Cashier gives indifferent attitude while flirting with China guy whose girlfriend is seated beside us. Busy chatting until I butt in and said I'm rushing for time
4
This was our third visit and we were left contented at the continued richness and tastiness of the broth. I had the set with the grilled pork cheek and the meat was great, though I would have welcomed a couple more pieces. My wife had the char siew ramen and she thoroughly enjoyed it. Do order at least a medium bowl if you are a regular eater, as the small bowl is, well, small. Though a little hard to find (it is located behind the Rendevous Restaurant) it is well worth the search
5
Ramen joints in Singapore have sprouted out in numbers over the past few years. 1 of my favourite is Santouka, with the other being Ippudo. Santouka is famous for the shio (salt) based tonkotsu soup. Noodles are al dente and have the right bite. I do recommend their famous pork cheeks too which are very delicious! Be prepared to queue during peak hours
