Amidst the flurry or Japanese options along Orchard Road, this place stands out for lunch. Great nigiri sushi and chirashi lunch sets cost around 15-25 SGD, a fraction of their dinner prices and good value for their solid rice and fresh fish. Worth a visit.

Fresh ingredients, enjoyed my dinner. Most staff were friendly except one waitress whose attitude needs improvement.

it was the first visit for me and my family, and it is not worth returning for the second time. Average food & service.

I had the set 9 and was impressed. The quality was top notch and though approx $60 net was well worth it. Would definitely be back.

Annoying experience at this place. We were there on a Saturday night. We had the 1 for 1 maguro don that was advertised in the laminated sheet and added that we wanted a chawamushi. On the same sheet the chawamushi price indicated was $5.To our shock when we were paying the bill we realised that the chawamushi cost us 12 and when we raised it to the cashier she said that yes it’s 12 and cos it contained the unagi (listed in the main menu). Instead of offering a solution she continued to charge our credit card while yelling for the waitress who took our order to come. We didn’t even open the main menu so how would we know that we had been served the premium chawamushi with unagi. In addition the waitress looked like a student and inexperienced. The cashier kept saying cos we ate it we would have to pay for it. Not wanting to create a scene we left. Nonetheless extremely bad experience and yes you have lost another customer (from the few that you r left).

We had a good meal in Japan Food Town recently so decided to check out another restaurant at the same venue. It was a very early dinner and since some restaurants were not ready for business we settled for Tsukiji Sushi Takewaka. Bad choice.Service was terrible. We were looking at a board to see what was on their menu and a waiter came by to greet us. I asked for a moment to finish what I was reading as there was no queue. Few seconds later I looked up again and asked him to seat us and he well, looked past us and casually called out to someone walking in who looked like another staff. Wasn't so impressed to be ignored since it only took me a few seconds before I asked for his attention.So we were seated and were served by a second staff - a young girl with good disposition but... seriously lacking in product knowledge. I enquired if their produce was from Tsukiji (as restaurant name suggested) and she didn't know. I asked why the sake prices were covered with sticker and she replied they were out of stock (almost 80% of the small sake listing). I was keen to know when they'll have the stock again. She didn't know and had to check. Came back and said they were not bringing in anymore.But it was the third staff who took the cake. She was standing couple of tables away looking bored and had nothing to do. When I caught her attention and asked to refill the tea, her attitude was bad and even gave a face as she walked away. In between the whole time when she was not standing looking bored, she was walking in a very slow pace near the few occupied tables eyeing the customers eating. It was to say the least, uncomfortable to the customers and rude.My order of Aburi Sushi was very average. It's not good quality sushi and I was honestly, a little let down. The rice was lacking in quality and the proportion of rice to topping was off (the rice was barely there). One of the fish in our other order of Chirashi Don was not fresh and the accompanying Soba overcooked and too soft.However, bad service and unremarkable food are not what earned them a 2 in the rating. The straw broke when I noticed the bowl of the Chirashi Don my kid had. It was chipped. She had almost finished her meal by then and I was really upset that she was eating out of a chipped bowl. Kids may accidentally place their lips on the bowl when eating, even if that didn't occur one might cut their hands when holding the bowl. This is something that should not have happened anywhere. On closer inspection, another plate before us was also chipped. Interestingly, after we complained a table near us also asked for the manager and it seemed like they were having the same problem.I can accept poor service and average food, but not when a restaurant doesn't respect the safety of their customers. Very disappointing.

First time there with my husband - opted for the set meal (nigiri set) and another a la carte nigiri set....set meal came with tempura soba. Sushi was great but tempura’s batter was more like a western fish&chip consistency rather than the light airy Japanese batter. Overall still ok

To say that service in Singapore is poor seems now a complete cliche but this restaurant still manages to surprise with a complete lack of engagement and empathy - very clinical throughout with staff seemingly going through the motions with zero interest in even remotely engaging with customers. They'd employ robots that you'd get better treatment.Disappointingly the food is equally mediocre - way too salty and oddly presented, it lacks the charm and authenticity of quality Japanese food.Overall, zero reason to return and this restaurant does a major disservice to the newly created Japan Food Town in Wisma Atria, for which we had high hopes... one would have expected they could find a decent operator for their flagship sushi experience. Avoid

Tried out this restaurant with the family. It serves mainly sushi and sashimi.We had the Gekimon Chirashi sushi and Hana Chirashi sets with an order of grilled salmon belly.The sets came with chawanmushi and soup. The sashimi were fresh and tasty. The chawanmushi was one of the best my wife and I ever had. It was smooth and just the right firmness. The salmon belly was grilled to perfection.We also had a scoop of their excellent ice cream. Rich, creamy and not too sweet.We were served by Bird and Si Jia. They were excellent. Helpful, attentive and unobtrusive.
5
All cuisines are very authentic with fresh food ingredient. The customer service is also very friendly and responsible. Price is reasonable for the Japan restaurants.

The sashimi served was fresh and the service of the restaurant was gd. A nice place for a gathering with friends & familes!

The food was tasty and the sashimi were fresh. There were a great variety of food. However i wish there were more dessert options and them being available too.
3
Nice quiet ambience but service can be better. Difficult to get the waitress attention. Seems to be understaffed.
5
The seafood was fresh and the otoro sashimi simply melts in your mouth..We ordered the sushi set and had the sashimi for two..excellent and attentive service.
5
We enjoyed the kaiseki set very much. The sashimi were fresh and generally very good quality. Sake list was limited but sufficient.

Japan food town at Wisma Atria - Tried Tsukiji Sushi Takewaka last night. The service needs some polishing - the service staff carelessly spilled soy sauce accidentally onto my jeans and wifey was almost a victim when they almost tripped over the soy sauce when serving her; the sushi, supposedly the strength of the restaurant, was well below my expectations. The rice fell apart very easily, and the raw fish were sliced too thinly for my liking. The tempura was passable but it was nothing to shout about (the batter was, unlike the raw fish on sushi rice, ever too thick); the stewed dish was lukewarm and the chawanmushi was, again, nondescript. All in all, it was very run of the mill

Unexpected japanese high quality food !the best Gindara Saikyoyaki I've ever eaten outside japan! it is grilled black cod cooked with saikyo miso (the miso makes thedifference!)Extremely fresh Sushi and sashimi. surprisingly wonderful tempura, try tempura cheese.try also chese + avocado + salmonand macha desser

I find that the lunch menu is really value for money. The same items are offered in their regular menu at a higher price. Lunch is also less crowded and more serene than dinner time. Their sashimi and Chirashi don was really fresh and tasty. Not too expensive and comes with miso soup and chawanmushi which is equally tasty. Will definitely go back again during lunch

Japan town at Wisma Atria houses many Japanese outlets, from ramen shops to the famous Tsukiji. Often busy during lunch, you might have to queue for a little while to find your seats. Food is served piping hot but a tad pricey. Most of the usuals can be found- unagi, sushi, chawan mushi, sushi platters, and also set meals.If you are a big fan of the same shop in Ginza, this shop won't disappoint
4
The sashimi here is really fresh. Staffs are also very helpful. Will definitely go again when I'm around the area.

The restaurant had great sushi and tempura. Overall, experience was an excellent dining for business and leisure. Thank you for your service.

Went for dinner on a weekday and the restaurant wasn't too crowded. The salmon avocado maki roll, cha soba and anago were decent. Ordered the uni tempura and wasn't impressed. Couldn't taste the uni at all and the batter was thick and not crispy.

Came here for lunch on Saturday. The price is quite high, but with the quality of Sushi and Sashimi that we got, it's quite worthy. Most of the fish are very fresh, and the Chirashi sushi is my personal favorite. Definitely coming back here.

Was at the newly minted Japan Food Town on level 4 of Wisma Atria, Orchard Road looking for a good Japanese meal. There are lots to choose from and it's interesting it's split according to the type of Japanese food by the region. I settled in at Tsukiji Sushi Takewaka and ordered the chirashi don. It came with a side serving of miso soup, chawanmushi and a slice of blood orange. The sushi was adequate for its price and delicious. And the chawanmushi comes with a layer of jelly-like sauce which makes the ultra smooth egg really easy on the tongue. Even the chicken meat is tender. And all at a surprisingly affordable price of S$14.90. I would say it's great value for money. Plus if you download the Japan Food Town app you get a 10% off your bill. Will def be back to try the other stuff on the menu.

Good food but was the first time that my family goes into the private room. Nothing great in fact we didn't like it. It was warm and there seems to have a lot of small flies on the wall. My kids were so afraid that those flies will stick to our food so we rush through dinner.

Japan Food Town has 16 restaurants in total. One selling unagi was so tiny. Decided to go there for dinner tonight only to be totally disappointed by Tsukiji Sushi Takewaka.Service was abominable. My dear husband waited 45 minutes for his meal. Why? Because his order did not show up in the system! But his set dinner of sushi and tempura did fly onto the table after that.Mine was an unagi set. Unagi was not bad. Our helper had a chicken soba soup which she said was good.It has rather reasonable prices for lunch but not so for dinner. I just don't think it was worth it. It's kind of neither here nor there in terms of pricing.The Manager gave us a card for a 20% discount for our next visit. Kind of dumb really. Don't understand why the discount couldn't be for tonight's meal since they made the blunder tonight. Duh!A much better choice would be Takujo Fine Dining just outside Emporium Shokuhin at Marina Square. That one I think is more pricey but better quality food and much nicer ambience and definitely much better service

Went to celebrate a friend's birthday, place was small and cosy. we ordered some tempura and the batter was a bit oily and bland. We each ordered some bento set, for me the rice is abit sour maybe due to the vinegar, the sashimi given is pretty thin in slices. Prices is also on the high set given the quality and portion that we are given.

Food quality and ambience was good, but restaurant refused to honour a promotional discount of 10% they advertised on magazine (Mangosteen Club). The Japanese Manager who could speak good English at first when we ordered our meal, suddenly could only speak Japanese when he explained why there was no discount when I showed him the advertisement and paid the bill. Strange! Manager said the promotion is for the next visit. I pointed out this condition was not written anywhere, not even in fine print. He said ' it is my rule'. Anyway I paid $240 for 3 pax without discount eventually. Well, that's some Japanese integrity I experienced tonight. What's the point of offering a promotion when in fact the restaurant is greatly reluctant to honour it? deceptive ads

We went for a Saturday lunch to celebrate my Son's 21st birthday. We ordered the Tsukiji sushi set ($63); a lunch special sushi ($24), Irodori bowl set ($39) and a Una Don set ($30). The lunch special is not that special - you pay peanuts, you get peanuts. The Tsukiji sushi set tastes better, however, it is not filling enough. The chawan mushi looks and tastes good tough, but we went there to eat sushi, not chawan mushi! Service Service is slow - we asked for more tea & one of the servers (who has a twin also serving in the restaurant) acknowledge our request with a look & "waved us away" and did not serve us tea. When we asked for the bill, one of the same twin servers treat us like invisible. Apparently, the owners think the food is enough (which is not really fantastic) & service is a luxury - so unlike Japanese.
