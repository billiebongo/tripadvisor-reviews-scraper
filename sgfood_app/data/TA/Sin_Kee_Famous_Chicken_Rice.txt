Guys, you ready? Sin Kee Famous Chicken Rice is the best chicken rice in Singapore. Essentially. I have tried many chicken rice dishes over the years but it just does not compare to this one. Nope, not bragging. Just telling the #TRUTH.

I went to the one at Holland, near my flat, I have to say it was the best chicken rice so far i've had, for me, this exceeded the famous one at Maxwell Market, you know which one i'm talking about. the rice is absolutely delicious, chilly was amazing, chicken is served chilled. do come no later than 2-3pm cause it may sold out. When I arrived and ordered my chicken, there was a young woman at the cashier, and older woman scooping the rice and one man cutting chickens. the woman at cashier wasn't friendly at all, she yelled out loud to a man after me for giving her $50. "I don't have change for $50!!!, do you have smaller notes?!!" in mandarin, wow seriously do you have to yell?, i thought to myself. the other two people at counter was neither friendly or rude, they were more like "nah, here is your rice!' attitude. so if you want to come and taste this delicious chicken rice, get your small notes and don't create hassle for that cashier unless you want to get yell at, she wants her customers to be straight up easy for her and don't create a slightest inconvenience for her

Have anyone tried this Sin Kee Famous Chicken Rice outlet at the newly opened and renovated FM Foodmore @ 3 Yuan Ching Road (Jurong Superbowl).. is this the same branch as the old Margaret Drive and Holland stalls ?i grew up eating the famous and best Sin Kee Famous Chicken Rice in Margaret Drive.. and even followed them when they moved to Holland area ! I was surprised when they opened a branch in this Jurong FM Foodcourt near to my home ! I was disappointed with the quality of their chicken, rice as well as sauces and the price is pretty expensive but then again, this is in a neighbourhood foodcourt !Price for half chicken is SGD $16 and costs $5 for 1 plate of chicken.. The chicken is nothing as compared to their famous branches, even the rice is oily and simple, chilli sauce is not tangy ! One word to sum up.. "Simple" as easily found in other chicken rice stalls in markets ! I noticed this branch instead of displaying their famous "white chickens", there's none on display except mostly Roasted Chickens on display.. strange ?Disappointing meal and left me wondered if this is the really "related" to the famous Sin Kee Chicken Rice or just a francise stall... ?

We have not tried this chicken rice since they moved out of their original location at the Margaret Drive market. The quality is still there. Chicken meat is still juicy and flavourful. The rice tastes right and so does the Chilli sauce. We ordered half at chicken @ S$13 and a bowl of lotus root soup (which is not tasty enough). Although we came at 12 noon on Tuesday, the queue was only 4 person deep and order taking was fast. There were plenty of seats at the airy food centre. We will be back for more. One of the best chicken rice in town

This chicken rice stall was manned by a son of the original founder. I was very popular until it changed ownership. Although it say Sin Kee, I guess the original owners must have sold their recipes to them.I found the chicken not as tasty as before. May be it is just mental.I did not even finish my plate which is quite unusual for me, especially chicken rice.Okay but not memorable.

They were reopened after closely sometime. I missed the stall and went back to taste it right after the news broke out.The chicken is still as tender as before.The service is now more "digitised". Good for them.I will bring my family back here for their chicken rice

It was tasty chicken rice. Chicken, rice and chili were all better than most chicken rice stalls. There is one near 20 Cross street , #01-03/04, China Square Centre, wherein you can get not only chicken rice but other varieties as well. My fav is their sweet & sour fish rice and egg. Price is reasonable and definitely will go again

Last month when I walked by this shop, saw some signs about their soon to be opened. Had determined it is my another must try place. Their new branch in East Coast Road has then truly opened just few weeks ago. I have tried and tasted many different Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore. The appearance for Sin Kee's chicken was pretty attracting. So fresh and shining looking when those white chickens were hanging up there. You can tell it is a good one right away.My judgement was right. I ordered the chicken rice with thigh meat. The meat was so tender and fresh. The only thing it was some fat which you need to remove it if prefer. Their rice was quite fragrance, texture was just right and the portion was much more than other restaurants. Even the tomato and cucumber were fresher than others. The ginger and chilli sauce were all great complement to the dish. But you could simply eat without adding anything else. Because the chicken and rice were delicious enough by itself.The staff named Mei was very friendly and a loyal employee who is not only a true advocate for the food but proud of her boss achievements too.I will definitely going back again and again

The way Ben prepares the chicken rice is extremely tedious and loaded with tons of effort. He follows his dad's recipe right to the smallest details. I once asked him why doesn't he prepares more chicken knowing that he has to turn away lots of customers who come late. He said that he is doing this out of his passion for the trade not for the money. As an ardent fan of his family's chicken rice for the last 33 years, the only concern I have is who will carry on the tradition of making this super yummy chicken rice. You have to try it if you are in Singapore
