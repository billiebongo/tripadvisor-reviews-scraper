I eat waffle with baileys ice cream and mou san wang ice cream and caramel gravy its really good, will come back next time
3
Good ambience and can be crowded over the weekend. Can prebook table ahead to avoid disappointment. Slow serving of food ; waited 30-45 mins on weekday dinner half filled restaurant
4
Delightful restaurant near to hotel, bit tired but well supported by locals. Good choice of dishes, great ice cream and coffee
5
Lovely café in Tiong Bahru. Had a wonderful lunch wit greattach atmosphere. Be sure to plan on dessert.

I noticed "Chapter 55" just across the street from the hotel I was staying at and went twice for dinner.  Both times it was half full, the service was fast enough and the young waiter who served my table twice, although it was a couple of days span between my visits, asked me if I would have the same wine as before - white Pinot Grigio.  The menu is quite extensive and the choice of ice cream, gelato, is huge. The pizza had good combination of ingredients, although the crust is too thin and crispy (not like they do it in Italy) for my taste but this is common for most pizzerias in Singapore. On the other hand, the waffles and gelato are mouth-watering and the latter is difficult to choose as there is a wide variety.  Nice atmosphere, interesting plackards on the pillars, good for groups and families with kids. Prices, in my opinion, are reasonable.  I would love to go again to "Chapter 55"

Casual dining but serve excellent food. Ordered squid ink pasta and thin crust pizza. both are delicious, better than i have tasted elsewhere. Had a starter of buffalo wings, its nice but not any special from elsewhere. Some problem with making reservation but no harm done

I’ve been to Chapter 55 thrice prior - food’s decent though considerably overpriced for a casual dining establishment on a weekend.My Boyfriend and myself placed our order with a service staff at 415pm. At 440pm - our food had not arrived. It was off-peak, the restaurant was barely half-full and service staff looked generally disinterested and bored - standing around not doing anything. We had to call someone over and enquire about our food - one of the service staff had the cheek to ask us if our order had been placed. After a while, we realised that 1) our order had been taken but for some reason, not communicated to the kitchen 2) the staff all looked confused. Manager did not come up to us to attempt to apologise, neither did we receive a definite time as to when our food would be ready. Note that we were the only new customers who had placed an order in the span of 30 mins. Kitchen was empty. We decided to forget about the meal and left. I’m not sure I would make the effort to recommend Chapter 55 to my friends, or anyone for that matter - given the exceptionally low bar for service. It would have been nice to have been reassured that the food was on the way, or that it would take at maximum another 10 minutes. Not for the staff (and manager) to stand there gaping with confused expressions.

1-for-1 deals for weekday lunch; doesn't apply to every single item on the menu, but they are clearly labelled & the variety is decent for a promotion.The Seafood Spaghetti & Vongole (White Wine Clams) Spaghetti were pretty generic & tasted like the base was the same, just different ingredients. However, they were delicious & I'd return again for this promotion because at $16++ each & then the 1-for-1 promotion, it's a good deal.Surprisingly, even though the space was crowded, we were able to be seated immediately - that probably depends on your luck, though. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats only No reservations Self-service water statio

Its my monthly visit to this cafe because I love their waffles and ice cream! Friendly service staff and very nice ans cosy ambience in the cafe. Their food is good too! Well recommended to bring your family and friends over for their main course and desserts!!!! Lovely and keep it up!
3
We only had our waffle there as it was told in google that they have one of the best waffle in town. Service was prompt, however waffles took about 25mins to be ready to serve.Store manager wasnt very helpful at the cashier. Delay payment of all guest and while collect payment he was also taking on reservations on phone. Ovarall - so so..
4
Reasonably priced with good meals. Would recommend for anyone staying in the area. Refreshing ice cream as well!
4
This cosy restaurant offers reasonably priced food and delicious waffles with gelato. They have big enough tables and room to cater to groups, making it a good place for gatherings.
5
Visited for lunch because my sister highly recommended it and the food and dessert definitely did not disappoint. Nice ambience to chill and relax, and staffs are friendly as well. Their crabmeat pink sauce spaghetti and salted caramel gelato waffle are superb!
3
Location - edge of tiong Bahru hipster area.
Ambiance- comfortable. Sat outside for early dinner
Service - could be friendlier. Especially runners who brought food.
Food - comfortable not gonna rave about it.
Will I come back? Only because of location.
5
The four mushrooms pasta here came with a generous serving of succulent oyster mushrooms, not overly seasoned with garlic and the pasta was cooked al dente. The service was fast as well, even during lunch hours.
5
This Italian Bistro / Cafe is a excellent place for cafe with a waffle with gelato. spacious restaurant fun and friendly staff. Very reasonably price food, great atmosphere, and just a short 5 in walk from the Hotel Nostalgia. will be going back when back in Singapor
5
Stayed opposite at Wangz Hotel and found this place on our 2nd day. Excellent coffee and gelato. Went for dinner on our last night in Singapore. Had the beef lasagne and pork sasuage ravioli. Both were very good and fast service. Will be back when next in town
5
Came across this cafe while passing by the streets.Love the ambience of the cafe.Service was...alright. Server was busy chatting with others that they completely forgot our order so we had to wait for another 20 minutes. Had a Butterscotch Waffles with 2 scoops of ice cream - Mau Shan Wang & Ferrero Roche. Gotta say the combination we picked was odd but it tasted just nice
3
Tucked at a corner of Tiong Bahru, this cafe is not as crowded with those popular ones nearer to Tiong Bahru Market. They spend effort on putting up the place and is rather interesting, food placement is good but waffles not the best that we tried. Cappuccino is okay as compared to my favour cafe. Recommended for getaway from the crowd of Tiong Bahru.
5
The 1-1 deal at lunch-time on weekdays makes this a really affordable treat! We got the 4-Mushroom Spaghetti, the John Dory and the Pumpkin Salad. The salad had a little too much dressing but the other two dishes were delicious - particulary the spaghetti. Portion sizes are generous. Service was prompt and friendly
4
this is a ever popular favorite of the office lunch crowd - 1 for 1 selected mains on weekdays. Good value lunches. But desserts and drinks not discounted. A scoop of gelato will set you back SGD$5.
4
Our hotel was near here so we spent a couple of nights here. Food pretty good, they make the best Sangria with a shot of Tequila! Great for birthday celebrations as they bring out a cake and everyone sings with loud music.
4
Italian cafe with the usual suspects. We enjoyed a vegetarian risotto and a pasta and the ice cream was extremely good.
5
Interesting pricing 1 for 1 !! You can get 2 items and pay 1.
Very good atmosphere and friendly staff !
Good adress to go for lunch or dinner with great dessert!
I recommend
3
We had chicken wings and shared a pizza, both were very nice but we thought the menu overall was quite expensive.
2
Went there twice. Tried their pan-fried chicken and waffles. Chicken tasted bland and not well-marinated. Waffles did not taste well too. Their ice creams were flavourful but not creamy enough. Would only go there during 1-for-1 lunch deal.
5
Relaxing, great food and the right feeling for any time dining, especially at nite, the service from the staff is first rate even though its bust, I would advise you to book ahead , make sure that you look at having the sweets with icec ream
4
The 1 for 1 lunch deal on weekdays is really quite good value but without it, the prices seem a bit steep. Even though this restaurant is close to both my office and home, I only come here during lunch as the full price doesn't quite seem to justify the quality and quantity.
2
And I am one of those who seldom criticize on food too! Granted I ordered off the menu because I wanted to eat squid ink lasagne but cannot have the shrimp and crayfish that came with the pasta along with the scallops, squid and clams, but somehow the pasta came with only two scallops, about four pieces of squid, and a copious amount of clam ... shells which occasionally has little pieces of clam meat stuck into them. What can I say? The sauce was good ??? And the pumpkin salad with greens was just drowning in dressing too. Hmm..
4
My family and I had lunch here on March 28,2017. I have been with friends before and enjoyed their waffles and ice cream tremendously. At lunch time on weekdays the 1 for 1 deals for some dishes makes it very worthwhile and I am glad to say the taste and portions are not compromised. Go early or after 2 pm if you don't want to wait for a table as it's packed with office workers. Service can be slow and not attentive during this time. I love the waffles so will be back
4
Came here today to try the 1:1 weekday set lunch. We had soup and a pasta main each and the total bill was $30: pretty good value. Seafood pasta was decent as was the beef lasagna. Not sure I'd want to pay full price though.
3
Located near the big street. Served different flavors of ice cream, server are generous with toppings and scoop of ice cream.
Dessert are nice too. Should give it a try if you are around the corner :)
4
My 1st time there and love the 1 for 1 lunch offer. We had a great time and will
recommend to others too.
4
Great to see that the fish dishes served are fresh. Simple, good value without being pretentious. They have a large menu, which unfortunately lends to some mediocre dishes. The carbonara was drenched in sauce and quite bland. Worth a repeat visit if you pick the right items.
4
My husband and I were exploring Tiong Bahru this afternoon and found Chapter 55. We originally planned on Cantonese for lunch but instead enjoyed a lovely Italian meal of pizza, lasagna and seafood pasta. Great service, low key environment and very reasonable prices! I wouldn't say it's a destination restaurant but a definite visit if you're in the neighborhood! Don't miss the cheese fries bolognese to start
4
This cafe has one of the most romantic experience. The lighting contribute to the romantic aspects. Great variety of gelato. The lime flavor, i recommend it to others that love lime or love challenging their taste buds. Not only the dessert is nice, even their simple pasta like vongole is this delightful. If simple pasta like vongole can be this nice, you can try imagine other food. They have added quite a lot of clams to it, which makes it more worth the price. The only one thing that I see is insufficient in the cafe is service. The staff are not really attentive. I took quite a moment like around 10 min to be able to take my order. I feel that they need to be more observant. Other than that, all is good. By the way, their bolognese lacks of the 'beefy taste'. And i won't explain further. Hopefully the next time I visit them, it will get better :
3
I was there for dinner, the food are Italian based and many choices.Price are not cheap, slight higher than average. But some of the dishes in the menu have 1 for 1 for weekday lunch, so I guess it's best to eat there during that time!We had Seafood Rissoto, Bonito pizza and seafood linguine.Taste is pretty good especially the Bonito pizza, although we find the Rissoto a bit too dry and salty.Environment is good and they realaly get crowded after 6:30pm!Didn't have chance to try their dessert.Maybe next time
4
I tried the buffalo wings and it's the best I have tasted to far. The margarita pizza was good. And the gelato was simply amazing.A simple restaurant and 1 for 1 lunch deal during the weekday makes it worth it. Service was good. Food was served within 10mins. Personally I liked this place and would visit again. Enjoy !
4
Came here for lunch a couple of times. The 1-for-1 lunch deal makes the meal really worth it, so come with friends! I tried both the chicken and sea bass dishes - personally preferred the sea bass more. The chicken was doused in pesto sauce and wasn't really worth the price (kind of expensive).The last time we came though, we waited AGES for my meal to come!! Like a good 15min between when they served hers and my meals...unacceptable! The waiting cost her the warmth of her food. It gets crowded during lunch hour because of the promotion, so come early or after 2pm
5
I'm so happy. I have a place to go for good pizza at a good price. I will always go during lunch to get the 1 for 1 deal. It's only on select pizzas but the Hawaiian and Romano pizzas were so good. I bought 2 pizzas for S$21 takeaway. I'm relatively cheap when it comes to pizza but I'm so happy with this price, value, and taste
4
Probably the best pizza I have had in Singapore! Good size, good price, good toppings. Staff are really good and attentive. We had a great time.
4
Great weekday offer of lunch although it does not apply to everything on the menu, only the cheaper dishes. Good taste especially the beautifully done sea bass. The sausages were also a delight.
4
I have been to Chapter 55 countless times, and not once they have not satisfied my palette with great service from their staff. Be it pasta or pizza, their home made gelato with yummy waffles, plus their lava cakes, are enough to make you drool.
4
 1 for 1 lunch promo to 3 pm on weekdays only. We ordered the following items 1. 2 Mushroom soups . SGD 8 . Not bad. Yummy âœŒ2. He ordered carbonara. I ordered beef lasagne. SGD 20. The carbonara a bit undercooked but otherwise okie. The lasagne is not bad. Total damage : SGD 30. Each pax SGD 15. They only charge GST here no service charge.
5
It was an evening hangout with friends as this place was very close to our hotel. Its very small with limited seating but very interesting interiors. The music they were playing was awesome. The staff is amazing and very helpful. Exhaustive Italian menu but we stuck to pizzas which were too yum. Ice tea was the best I ever had. And the desserts.. OMG.. you must have the waffles here
5
This is an interesting place, and it has a strong Italian flavour - great pasta. The staff are attentive and know the menu well. However, the desert is a must. An explosion of flavours and tastes, and the presentation is excellent. It is worth a taxi or MRT ride to enjoy the experience. If someone in your party is having a birthday/celebration, keep it a secret and tell one of the staff - be prepared for a different surprise
4
This unassuming little restaurant tucked at a corner of Tiong Bahru Road serves really delicious food. The mushroom soup ($8) is thick and creamy. The beef bolognaise tasty ($18). Beef Tenderloin ($34) is tender. John Dory ($18) is fresh. Staff are friendly. Only downside is a bit noisy and yes the patrons dine wearing t-shirt and Bermudas
4
This was a lively restaurant n the middle of the up and coming Tiong Bahru area of Singapore. Lovely food, excellent service and a good atmosphere. Range of Italian food and the most amazing desserts - good choices for everyone. Excellent choice of Ice cream. Well worth a visit. Had we stayed longer in Singapore we would have gone back again
5
The 1-for-1 Lunch deal is simply awesome. You will just need to pay $18 for a seafood pasta and any of the other dishes pictured (pizzas are included too). This, Chapter 55 gets really crowded during lunchtime! The extremely affordable prices and substantial portion is truly an attraction
5
After a long trip from the UK my son and I wanted somewhere really close to where we were staying to have something to eat. Advised by hotel staff to try Chapter 55 across the road from Hotel.After opting for pizza the helpful waiting staff advised pizza was very big and enough for the two of us.Pizza was great,coffee great and also my son really enjoyed the ice cream selection that he chose (far too many he wanted to try them all).The atmosphere was great the staff very helpful and all greeted with a smile. Would definitely go again on my return visit to Singapor
5
Had dinner there one evening. Food was remarkably good; reasonable prices, good service. Great gelato bar. Enjoyed this immensly
4
Popular restaurant near Holiday Inn Atrium. Nice Italian food, authentic flavours and well presented. Friendly and efficient service. Apparently well known for its desserts which we didn't try. Pasta dishes were yummy. Good value for money in Singapore.
4
After sampling some of the traditional Singaporean meals, my wife and I felt like something a bit different so we headed off to Chapter 55 Restaurant which was a short walk across the road from the Link Hotel we were staying in . We were presently surprised by the lovely atmosphere and pleasant decor. The staff were very friendly and attentive and the selection on the menu had some great dishes to choose from. We both enjoyed our meals with a glass of wine and very much enjoyed this dinning experience
4
First time here .... Food is not bad especially the Lamb Shank ... The seafood spaghetti was so so and portion is ok only. The waffles dessert is to die for ... Crispy warm waffles with delicious choices of gelato !!!Overall nice place and reasonably priced food.
4
Italian-style food with a bit of a local twist to it; good atmosphere, place is crowed, lively, don't go there for a romantic tete-a-tete. Must try the gigantonormous waffle desert.better avoid the house wine, not sure where that Shiraz / Merlot is from...would I go again: YE
3
we had dinner here on our first night here and hubby had a pizza and i had the sea bass. very nice meal but almost died when the bill came as we had both had 2 drinks during the meal and it came to $82 which i thought was a big much. i only eat small meals and normally only have an entree as a main meal but this main was entree size so was good
4
Big fan of their pastas and risottos. Tried a couple of their mains as well and never failed to impress us. Pastas are al dente, unlike many local restaurants that failed at cooking pasta. Great Italian food at affordable prices without going to pricey Italian restaurants. Love their gelatos too - try the Mao Shan Wang, Lychee Martini, Mandarin Orange, flavours! However, they have recently increased the prices of the gelatos - not good.A few of the newer staff need more training. One has gotten orders wrong and cannot understand our simple orders. But we love the seasoned staff - very friendly
4
This is quaint little restaurant which seats about 10-15 tables with both indoor and outdoor seating ... its children friendly, they have baby chairs which will be provided upon request ... My favorite in their menu is the waffle with gelato , they have a choice of 8-10 flavors if not more ... I had Duck Rissotto , one of their Pizzas and waffles ... Everything was tasty and well presented ... The service staff is averagely pleasant so i would like to see more improvement over there ... If that happens then i would give it 5 rating instead of the 4 i have given right now

4
Drop in to this Italian bistro for lunch and you'll get a 2 for 1 deal on pizza or pasta. The best thing about the place though is the young waitress named Catherine. We arrived in the area late in the evening looking for directions. And even though the restaurant was busy, Catherine went above and beyond to help us find our way. Good food, great waitress
3
Place setup is very nice. Calamari could be better if has deep fried longer.
Gelato range is good and taste good. Overall food taste good.
5
Gelato ! A real italian gelato !
We were so full yet we can't help not going in for a real italian flavour !
Buy one get one free all weekdays, that makes it even better.
Great value.
5
menu is mostly italian type.pizza is good.deserts are excellent.staff are happy and attentive.nice atmosphere.prices are on the high side but worth it.can be crowded on some nights so best book on friday and saturday evenings.
3
Good italian food, scrispy pizza and other well done dishes here, but the best is the icecream.
Nice atmosphere and the service is quite fast.
5
Found this restaurant whilst walking round from Hotel Nostalgia one night & had 2x excellent gelato cones. Returned for thin & crispy pizza & very nice pasta one night whilst also enjoyed the 1-for-1 lunch deal one deal
4
Lucked into this place after eating a quick Chinese lunch elsewhere.... Walked in here while dodging rain! Great environment to relax.... All the food looked great!! The apple pie was mediocre, but the presentation and vanilla gelato was wonderful!! I'll definitely plan to come here for lunch or dinner the next time I'm in Singapore!!
5
Fresh pizza and nice surrounding restuarant, clean and warm welcome in here.I stayed at a hotel nearby the chapter55 which is convenience to eat italian food here. A varities of flavors Ice-cream looked fantastic however I haven't tried it yet because I was full with Hawai pizza
5
The perfect way to end the day after a spicy meal is to go to Chapter 55 in Tiong Bahru for a delicious ice cream. I had salted caramel ice cream and tirimasu . Very creamy. Great welcome from the friendly staffWell worth a visit
1
This is the 1st time here though I always pass by this restaurant. Saw good and bad reviews on the website. My order is Aglow Oglio seafood spaghetti & seabass but it's really horrible to have such a taste not even average standard. Sea bass is overcooked but still better the spaghetti was wondering how can they be even call Italian Bistro when they can't even cook a proper spaghetti. The waitress service is true not good as post on the website but they don't charge service fee so I guess it's fair then you don't expect any service from them. Really not worth to try them, you can find better food in Tiong Bahru area with cheaper cost
4
The place is convenient, just along the main road (beside the Link Hotel) and we happened to pop-by for lunch when they were having a weekday lunch promotion.!Lunch time crowd is busy, with some patrons having to seat outside (alfresco indeed!). But service remains efficient and our order arrived within 10 mins, ready & hot!. The portions are not generous but still decent ,  Though my first time here it sure looks an interesting place to hang around! It has a cozy interior and the decor is interesting with some thought-provoking pictures & signs. They served a long list from pasta to pizzas to risottos. There are also appetizers and desserts (waffles & gelatos) to choose from. Our bunch of friends share some spicy buffalo chickens & gelato (ice-cream) too. We ordered passion, honey-ginger and lemon tea as drinks, not too disappointing. For main course it was beef lasagne and dory fish. Though none of them 'blew us off' they all tasted modestly well. Staff were friendly, cheerful and efficient which contributed much to the relaxed-wonderful atmosphere. And the place sure looks a good spot to catch up with friends & colleagues.The bill was reasonable for our party of 5, with the Promotion! Will come back again and try out other signature dishes.Recommended to try..
5
This is a great little restaurant, lovely staff, lovely food. Good price for Singapore. Amazing selection of handmade ice cream too
5
a crowded joint, but the food is really good, especially the truffle fries.
big portions, especially for the pasta.
4
Visited on a saturday night, very busy but service remains efficient amd production of food very quick, served hot and tasty. Overall experience good, apart from the drink they forgot and the hawaian pizza not that tasty. But worth to visit and i will come bac
5
This place is unbelievable. Even if you are not staying in Tiong Bahru area. this restaurant is a must. the pastas are fantastic. the gelato in a word WOW and the waffles, well do yourself a favour, get on down there and get yourself one. The menu is extensive, its great for families and the staff are fantastic.
4
Staying at the Link Hotel, we found this little number. Mainly Italian food and very busy with the locals. (Always a good sign) Very friendly service and good food. Not huge servings for the Western tourist but sufficient for my wife. They have a one for one deal at lunchtime. Give them a go.
4
We headed here for lunch as I've been told they had the 1-for-1 deal. It meant that you can choose 2 dishes from a certain selection of dishes and just pay for the price of one! It's rather worth it if you come with a bunch of friends and share the food! Food wise is decent while the coffee is nothing to shout about but decent to fix your caffeine craving!
3
Visited last night and we were surprised to know that they don't serve bread which is quite unusual for an Italian restaurant.There's an opportunity to improve on timing of the serving. We were served the main course while halfway on appetizer. It resulted to squeezing in the big plates on a small table, plus the main course got cold. Otherwise, the sea bass pesto and duck confit were ok, the gratin as side was quite good, and the foie gras was bland. Wine was not ok. Plating /food presentation was good.The dessert portion was bigger than usual, good for sharing
4
Visited the restaurant twice during our short visit to Singapore as we stayed in a hotel nearby. First time was for lunch and dinner on the other day. Among the great food we had were the calamari fritti, pizza margherita, rocket & caesar salad and the handmade pasta! Don't forget to try their gelato too! The staff was friendly and they have nicely decorated interior. The only downside was that they only serve Australian beers, ales & stout instead of having Italian beers maybe
3
Don't expect high-end Italian dining here, think of it more like TGIF or Applebees. The food is honest and hearty, the service is cheerful and the prices are reasonable. The decor is an interesting mix of what the interior designers wanted (hipster brick and copper industrial) and what the owners wanted (cat pics and funny signs), so it won't be classy enough to impress a date, but it is a congenial atmosphere to catch up with friends.In that strange inexplicable way that Singapore restaurants sometimes have, when we tried to book for 7.30pm we were told that all bookings are a standard 7pm, but they would try to hold our table
4
We were planning to go to another place for lunch when hubby spotted this place and suggested we go here instead. We ordered the crab bisque, calamari, sausage and mushroom pizza and 3 flavours of their gelato ice cream Crab bisque - flavorful although a little watery than I expectedCalamari - nice. My daughter couldn't stop eatingPizza - freshly made with thin crust. Love it. My daughter who doesn't like pizza too much actually said it was nice and finished a whole slice by herself (she's only 3!)Gelato - not bad. It is a little too sweet for my liking although hubby and daughter were happily gobbling theirs downStaff were friendly, efficient and relaxed (in a good way) which enhanced our experience. Will definitely come back again
4
Been here a few times - risotto is better than any I have tasted, especially the saffron seafood. Waffles are lighter than normal, freshly made and pretty as a picture. Reasonable food at fairly reasonable price point.
5
Excellent menu ....great selection of ice creams .... Busy place so perhaps book or come early ,,.. Service great ,,,,
5
Italian Food mixed with Singaporean courtesy. Value for Money.
Thye service was really good so was the food.Whenever you go, the place is full of people, hence feels very vibrant
5
One of the newest and best pizza and pasta in Singapore at reasonable price. Located at Tiong Bahru. For lunch there serve 1 for 1. Waffle with ice cream is also one of my favorite. Highly recommended
3
Location - tiong bahru area in front of Wangz hotel. Can b a pain to park.Premise - ok sized. Good mix of modular tables that allow for mix n match of tables to cater for small or large number of pax. Decor is some what similar to the rest. U c 1.... u c em allStaff - friendly and smiles all around.Crowd - friends... families... couples. All sorts! :))Food - only had the dessert. Lava cake. Nah. Had much better ones before.Verdict - will i come back? Only to try the main dishes. Dessert time over there again? Sorry but the lava cake was the FINAL chapter for me.... gedditttt :)

My wife and I have been to Chapter 55 three times over the last year. The first time was for dessert. We decided to try the gelato because it looked absolutely delicious. I had a mango gelato. But the flavour was terrible! The staff had carelessly used the same scoop for durian and mango, and as a result my mango gelato tasted like durian. Could have been an honest mistake. The second time we went to Chapter 55 was for dinner. Service was slow, but then again the place was quite full and so we though the slow service could only mean that the kitchen was under a little strain. The third time really sealed the deal for us. We're never going back. The lady who took our lunch order served our pizza to another table. We waited for 40 minutes before reminding her about it and she was as surprised as we were about it. The place wasn't crowded, so that couldn't have been an excuse this time. The lady waiting our table was not very apologetic about it and said she can ask the kitchen to make us another pizza if we were willing to wait for 7 minutes more. The pizza eventually came to us 10minutes later, but we were charged full price for the meal (I must also add that the meal was slightly overpriced). The taste of the pizza was not too bad, but certainly not worth the price and the time we spent waiting for it to be served.

Hello readers, Yesterday at about 930 pm, my best bud brought me to Chapter 55 for some ice cream waffles. I'd heard about their Durian Ice Cream, and we're big Durian Fans. We went to try their ice cream flavors, they were mostly really good. Serving lady was generous with a tasting scoop and was all smiles when we tried the different flavors. Mandrin orangeLychcee MartiniMao Shang Wang DurianSalted CaramelWhen it came, it looked really good. But we were disappointed in the taste of everything. Ice cream on its own was really good. Cream didn't add value to the dish, not did the sour cinnamon apple/fruit. I would suggest that customers have the ice cream on its own, get an extra scoop instead of the waffle. Thanks W&J for the treat

My group of girlfriends, a total party size of 8 decided to check out Chapter 55 at hipster land. So I called in to make a reservation, but an automated voice answering machine told me I would receive a text message to complete the reservation, which I did. It was a short URL to make a reservation via Chope. However on Chope, I could only select a maximum party size of 6. So in the comments I asked for 2 more seats.A few hours later I got a call saying that their cafe's reservation policy requires each person to spend at least $25 and order a main course. Waffles which are riced $18.50+ with 2 scoops of ice cream are not considered a main course. Even the staff encouraged me to walk in. This is ridiculous. So we decided to walk in, and the food better be worth the effort!Despite the phone call, I was delighted to be greeted by the beautiful ice cream display!And I pinched myself to be sure I wasn't dreaming when I saw the $23 per pint price tag. Okay, let's see if their ice cream is really twice as good as other competitors, to be priced this high.The interior has a very homely, retro feel to it, the lighting isn't instagram's best friend. You will have to improvise or try and get a table by the windows.1. Beef Bolognese Cheese Fries $15+With truffle tries price at $14, we decided to try something else. Sadly, this dish wasn't what we expected, even though there is supposedly cheese in the sauce. We couldn't taste any. It was a plate of very soggy fries, with a very under seasoned beef bolognese sauce.2. Squid Ink Risotto $25+Tasted cheesy and I felt gerlat very quickly. This is the first plate of Risotto that I didn't like, I am normally a huge fan of Risotto.It's waffle time! Despite the unsatisfying experience with the main courses, I was so certain the highly instagrammable waffles with ice cream would be the highlight of my night!3. Waffles with Mao shan wang durian and belgian chocolate $18.50+I liked that the durian ice cream colour wasn't overly yellow, which a lot of ice cream parlours, normally add yellow colouring to, it didn't smell very fragrant but it tasted good. I liked the durian ice cream. The Belgian chocolate tasted okay, it didn't leave an impression for me. The waffles, which I was looking forward to, tasted ok, I've definitely had better waffles in the surrounding area.4. Waffles with Pulut Hitam and Pistacchio $18.50+The only redeeming factor that Chatper 55 had for me tonight, was the Pulut Hitam ice cream, which I truly enjoyed. However not all the girls at my table liked it. It wasn't displayed, but they had it in the freezer. You could bite into the black rice bits in the ice cream. It a legit, pulut hitam ice cream! The Pistacchio was also a memorable ice cream flavour. You can distinctively taste the pistacchio.The bill for 6 girls and we weren't very big eaters, so asking all 6 of us to order a main course each isn't the wisest cafe policy, even from a business stand point.The staff weren't well organized and took a long while to clear our table. The first staff cleared one plate, and a male staff cleard 2 more plates. We were done with all our plates and when the waffles came, we still had half a table worth of dirty plates. Only after the second waffle came to our table, did another male staff who served us the waffles, clear the rest of the dirty dishes.The chinese local lady at the cashier who spoke mandarin was very friendly and polite. I had higher hopes for their ice cream and waffles with such a high price tag on each plate. On the bright side, they have BOGO weekday lunch offers

Came here for lunch today: pleasantly surprised to see an extensive range of 1:1 lunch deals. Opted for the mushroom soup to start with and followed up with the seafood aglio olio pasta, both of which were very decent. Worth making a trek out here for lunch

I love Rome and this little Italian bistro in Singapore brings me right back. I've been here a few times now and each meal was excellent but I just had their fresh made paste in a scallion laced cream sauce with prawns and scallops and clams that was buttery and simply perfect. If your in the neighbor and you love the simple perfection of Rome 's best, this place is a must

Do yourself a favour and call in to experience a great menu and yummy ice-cream. The food & service were excellent and the atmosphere was generally quiet even though the place was full every night we were there. We shall return.

This restaurant serves pizza, pasta, salad, ice cream and more. The food was okay, a bit pricey though. Staffs were nice.
If you intend to try this restaurant, they're having a 1-for-1 lunch on weekdays.

2nd visit to this Italian bistro. The buffalo wings are delicious, spicy and yummy. They serve good quality food. Their gelatos are yummy and of good quality. Most importantly their staffs are very friendly and attentive. I will return for their waffle ice cream. Just to share, they have weekday 1 for 1 promotion

I've visited Chapter 55 since its first days of business and must say their food as well as service is one of the best in town. 1-for-1 lunch promotion is a must to try, though its only available during weekdays. Prices could be a little bit more expensive compared to other restaurants in Tiong Bahru area but it's worth a try

We were warned about their crowds for weekday lunch so our party arrived promptly at opening.We shared the following items:Caesar Salad - okSea Bass, lemon pesto sauce - dryBonito pizza - niceWaffle ice cream - waffle was soggyOverall nice but seems their crispy waffles have fallen behind.Hopefully the lunch crowds keep coming for their popular 1-for-1 else a bit costly for ala cart

This is a smallish casual Italian cafe/restaurant located near the Wangz Hotel.I have eaten pasta marinaras all over the World and this is the best I have had. The linguini tasted as though it was made in house, the selection of sea food was plentiful and fresh and the tomato based sauce with garlic and chilli was spectacular. A truly memorable dish.If you have room the gelati bar is well worth a visit to complete your meal. The lychee and mandarin flavours were both great.Alcohol was expensive but I guess that's normal for Singapore; the beer selection was 100% Australian

A very nice, quaint and cozy Italian restaurant with reasonable prices, both for their pasta and drinks. I ordered a squid ink linguini and my husband ordered a risotto. My pasta was incredibly cooked al dente although was a tad bit salty. The claims, prawns and crayfish was firm and fresh. The risotto was great too. Lots of flavors and cooked just right. Special thanks to jason who took care of us and took my review of the food with a big smile. I will definitely come back.

We stumbled upon this Italian Bistro, Chapter 55, at 55 Tiong Bahru Road, which was newly opened in Dec 2014, by the owners of the Ice Edge CafÃ© in Kovan.They have a full gelato counter, and serve a range of Italian classics, including pizzas, pastas & risotto, seafood and meat. Their mains are priced between $16-$36 (mostly at $20+).We dropped in for their one-for-one lunch, which is available during weekdays, for selected items on their menu. The place was packed, and we had to wait about 20 minutes for our food. We were ok with the wait tho, 'cos we really liked the cozy interior and the friendly staff.We took the picture below during the off-peak period when they serve "tunch". Loved the space, and made a mental note to return for waffles/desserts and drinks.Refer to our blog for more information and pictures: https://angiekayexplorer.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/1-for-1-lunch-chapter-55-italian-bistro-in-singapore

Squid ink pasta was truly al dente and generous portion of seafood, though it was a tad salty. Vulcano pizza (like a calzone) did not have much punch in taste, probably too much tomato paste. Roche-flavoured gelato tasted just like Ferrero Roche chocolates! Even the 'mau shan wang' flavoured gelato was so rich and creamy. The memorable experience was the interaction with the staff, esp Jeryck! He was SUPER attentive. We had the luxury to try almost all the different flavours they have at the counter, because he was patiently describing and serving the sample scoops to us. On top of that, Jeryck was also very meticulous. He knew that it was my friend's birthday dinner, he organised the crew to sing a birthday song and brought the scoops to us with a lit candle! It was such a pleasant lovely surprise not only for the birthday girl, but also us! Although he was serving at the gelato counter, he was observant enough to get his colleague to help us with photo taking when he noticed we were struggling to take 'selfies'. Such acts of service richly enhanced our dining experienc
