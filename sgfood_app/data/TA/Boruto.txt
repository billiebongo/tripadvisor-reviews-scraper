My girl posted in facebook and i went to try, food was good and yummy. Will go again soon, as yet to try others range of food from their menu.
5
Awesome food. My favorite would be the truffle somen and squid tentacles. Wide selection of (Japanese) drinks. Happy hour until 8pm.
5
Foods at B≈çruto was great! The ambience is good too! I would go back for the food and ambience!
However, the staff could have arranged a more comfortable table/seat for us, since we went like 5pm and the restaurant was quite empty.
4
food was great, we really enjoyed the food! Good service, friendly staff and nice ambience. Sure we will visit again!
4
Food was good and service was prompt. However, it would be good if they were to recommend more on their selections.
5
Nice ambience.. tapas v yummy too. My friends and i have a good time. Good service. V attentive staff.

This cosy restaurant helmed by a local chef has a lively vibe and serves very creative Japanese cuisine at reasonable prices.

Was given the counter seat even when the restaurant was obviously empty that time (5pm) as we were told it is fully booked.We requested proper seats and told them that we will move once there is people needing the seat, therefore we were given unwillingly a older waitress. At 630pm when we left, there was no additional people occupying the other 4table? Imagine they didn't offer us the table, we will be awkwardly facing the staffs in the bar and listening to each other's conversation as the restaurant was empty af the entire meal. It cost for 2 cost abt 18+$, the service was all great except for that waitress which gave an uninterested attitude when serving/clearing the food, (I almost thought I owed her money) the rest were really polite. I mighy visit again though

My office is around the corner, I have walked past this restaurant numerous time during day time it is always close. I was extremely curious since it is always closed. Signage was not obvious and operating hours are not stated, as such I did not pay too much attention them until they collaborate with CHOPE. Advance booking is require as online reviews mentioned they are always full house. I arrived at 7pm seated by the bar table near to entry, they rejected quite a number of spontaneous clients due to full house.The high chairs along the bar ain't extremely comfortable, hope they could look into it. Service staffs probably have to be more attentive on these areas:- Bag chest is not offer unless requested- We ordered big bottle of sake, they will normally transfer some sake to the decanter for customers. Most of the time we are replenishing our own sake rather than being service. Under staffs as you could see their staffs are practically running to attend to customers.- However each time they helped us to replenish sake into the small decanter, a couple of times sake was replenished to the brim. I understand the staffs are busy, however this should not be the way. - Their kitchen is open concept, allowing customers to have the view of their food making. Honestly we enjoy seeing how the chefs make these delicious delicacies but we don't think it is appropriate for chefs to scream at the top of his lungs when calling out orders to his team.Foods was amazing, you have to try to know what I meant. Just mental note I would request for normal table and chair seating for my next visit.

Brought here by a friend who knows the head chef , angus. By the end of the night, it seemed like half the customers are his friends. Counter-style dining, with some tables as well. Japanese influenced tapas basicallyWe didn't specifically order and Angus just served his specials - spicy octopus, mussel soup, charcoal chicken, oysters, somen. The soup and somen are stand-outsIt happened to be a very noisy crowd - large family talking at the top of their voices, and a large group of angus' friends having a jolly time. I wish it was quiete
3
Boruto's somen is great, but the rest of the food, while fresh and thoughtfully prepared, are often overwhelmed by the overdone sauces.
5
Second time at boruto and the quality of food consistent. I enjoyed the pulled pork tapas and cold somen in particular. Thank you Boruto for the excellent dishes.
4
Happy hour sake at $10++! 4 varsity to pick.
Food is tasty a little pricey as most items are tapas style.
2
Forgot our orders. And orders took forever to be done. Also items were way over priced for quantity and quality! We understand that it is a tapas bar however $18.80 for 1 piece of scallop?
5
You can taste the passion in the delicacy of the cooking and preparation.
Definitely a must-try if you're looking for awesome Japanese food!
5
The food is really good. The chef cooked with passion. & best of all the price is very reasonable! Highly recommended
5
A wonderful place for a selection of Gourmet Japanese Tapas and premium Sake.
Great vibe on weekends!
5
Second time & recommended new friend this time. Was again really satisfied with the food each time both friends & myself. Especially like the truffle hiyashi somen, ebi tempura donburi & ahi tataki. Good that it is tapas portion so can try more items but ironically it is a little pricey for the tapas. They have very good sake selection too, had a good one from Hyogo. Will be back to dine again introducing new friends to it. Saturday is a good time for value happy hours dishes plus sake yet minus the crowd
4
This is one of the better izakaya bar in town. There have a wide selections of sake and Japanese whiskies. Drinkers that fancy Japanese whiskies and sake will definitely love this place. On top of Japanese brands they also carry other type of whiskies and wine too. A nice place to chill and hangout after a long hard day at the office
5
I went there for a quick middle day snack, ended up having a full meal instead! Just couldn't get enough of this delicious food.Started of with a tuna tataki with Japanese leeks and chili sauce, followed by suveed short ribs Wich would just melt in your mouth and ended up with the truffle hiyashi somen, the all suggested by the professional chef Angus.Thank you again guys! I really appreciate your job and I'll be back for sure to try more of the food and get a culture of sake
5
Very very good food love it. Service is good too . Value for money. Cold pasta Nunber one . üëç.......................................must try ......
5
Enjoyed watching how each dish is made from scratch. Good quality of food served. Price is on the steep side but it's all worth it!
5
Friendly staff, quick to requests and yummy food. Instant fix to work stress with friends. Fell in love with the whiskey I have been longing for. Reservations highly recommended especially for Friyays!
4
Great vibe, friendly service, delightful homemade plum wine and good value $10 tapas dishes and selected beers and sake on Saturdays. Just wonderful!
3
Forgettable but select dishes were interesting. Happy hour Drinks were affordable for CBD area. Service could be better. Oysters were good but over priced.
3
There are star items in their repertoire that are very satisfying. Beyond those however, it's rather hit and miss.
4
Small restaurant but will space out so doesn't feel cramp. The tapas are tasty. I love the Oyster. 2 at $18.80. They have a good selection of sake and offer some in carafe. Expect to pay more than similar restaurants.
4
Boruto is located just outside the hotel I've stayed and they serve uni pasta which was why I picked that place. We arrived about 8.30pm and sadly they ran out of uni already. We opted for Truffle Cold Somen as an alternative. It's different but it's good too. There are a couple of specials that goes for SGD10, eg. negitoro don but was fairly simply and nothing special. Crispy pork and rice sushi we had for starter was very addictive. Foiegras could've been better - a little more pan fried would be nice. Some fish we had that came in a form of fillet, was really bland. Some hits and misses here and there, but generally we enjoyed most of their food. Perhaps a few improvements would set things right
5
Everything we ordered was different and phenomenal. It's a very creative menu. We ordered oysters, crispy rice taco (amazing), sashimi and avocado and crab salad. We ordered cocktails which were made with tremendous detail and tasted fabulous. They do have wine (contrary to previous reviews) but it's a limited selection. It's a former bank and they store some of the best sake behind a vault. We ended with a great closer - the chocolate surprise. We will go back!
4
I work nearby, so there's always the glitzy temptation of 28HKST or FOC, but Boruto has consistently performed beyond expectations with both food quality and drink pairings. Their 10-10 weekend (Saturday), is perfect for a couple's dinner. Order any tapas for $10, and get sake pairings at $10 per cup. I usually leave it to the staff, who are rather good at pairings.I do love the new dishes that they put out. Teba Gyoza (basically chicken wings stuffed with gyoza filling!!) and Tori Take are must orders! I walked in sceptical, but I'm a fan now
5
Strongly recommend the somen and tako with truffle. Sashimi may be small pieces but fresh. Overall pricey but good experience.
4
Big selection of Sakae , tapas style Japanese French fusion food . Reasonable price . Great for date night.
5
Food was tasted excellent and the staff were welcoming and friendly. Definitely visiting this restaurant again.
5
We had a fabulous time! Ordered half the menu and a tower of Asahi.
I think my fav was the oysters with yuzu and wasabi!

We decided to try this place out having just read about it. We went there on Saturday night and the place was buzzing with people and activities. We ordered about 6 tapas and 2 glasses of beer. The first dish that came was the fried salmon skin which was nice. We thought the next dish would come soon after but alas, it took a good half an hour before the next dish came and this was after we had to bring it up to the attention of one of the servers. By then, we were rather hungry and polished off the whole basket of the salmon skin. We also had the scallops, clams, gambas, octopus and something else which I have forgotten. The dish that stood out was the clams because we enjoyed the soup that came along with it. We ordered 2 desserts - truffle Creme br√ªl√©e and another which was alright.The strange thing was that there were servers standing around but the food just took very long to come out of the kitchen. There seemed to be a party going on the second floor and perhaps that took a toll on the food preparation staff resulting in the backlog.The place has a nice vibe to it although the air Cond was too cold. I think we would have enjoyed the night out more had we not made to wait so long for the food. Food wise, I think it is worth a try for sure
5
My first time @ Boruto and it did not disappoint. The place has a minimalist feel about it spread of 2 floors. Our host, Angus, was superb - He order on our behalf and showed us their Sake ‚Äúcellar‚Äù - Full or rare (And expensive) sake. Food was excellent and as we were seated at the bar everything was made in front of us. Can‚Äôt recommend the place more. Only ‚Äúdownside‚Äù if you call it that was apart from Sake there‚Äôs a limited menu for anything else - They don‚Äôt stock wine for example etc

Boruto is a new concept Japanese modern kitchen plus Japanese Sake Bar. It is a sister restaurant of Tamashii Robataya, one of the few Robatayaki restaurant in Singapore. Unlike its sister restaurant, Boruto served Asian fusion, predominately using Japanese ingredients to go with their extensive list of Sake. The unit at Golden Castle Building that is occupied by Boruto, used to be a bank. The first floor is the Tapas Bar, complete with the view of its open kitchen. The second floor is the sake bar, mostly focus on drinks, a bit of bar bites and extensive display of sake in fridge and as well as their cold room Vault. Yup, they keep their sake in a vault complete with a security device, the vault was left by the previous tenant, so for the fun of it, they have reused the vault for their expensive bottles of sakes.While waiting for all our group to arrive, we nibbled on Sake Kawa Senbei ($8.80). It is a crispy salmon skin tossed with sea salt & chili powder. Solid crispy salmon skin, delicately seasoned and a good bar food dish. To celebrate the year of the Rooster, Boturo curated the Chinese New Year Japanese Truffle Infused Yu Sheng with Salmon & Yellowtail Sashimi ($68 for 3 to 5 pax). A beautifully plated Yu Sheng, drizzle with truffle infused oil plus golden pouch. The Yu Sheng is just delicate and refreshing, while the truffle infused oil accentuate the flavours of the salmon and yellow tail sashimi. A good start to our main meal. A bigger portion for 6 to 10 pax is available for $98. There is also Salmon Skin Yu Sheng ($48 for small, $68 for large) and Japanese abalone Yu Sheng ($98 for small, $168 for large). Kani Croquettes ($12.80). A Blue crab meat croquette with sweet corn & poached onions, black garlic mayo. According to Chef Angus Chow, Boruta does not use any milk or cream in their croquette. This bite size croquettes has a crispy exterior to protect the creamy fillings. For me, it tasted like eating the crab roe from the female crab. Yum Yum. Hotaru Ika ‚ÄúChai Tao Kuek‚Äù ($12.80). Loligo squid saut√©ed with garlic, poached onions, Japanese pickles & egg. Tender and springy squids well coated with generous amount of eggs. Not your regular Chai Tao Kueh though. Madai a la Plancha ($15.80). A Grilled sea bream with red miso broth, Shiitake & minced pork. The firm texture of the sea bream provided a good protein to absorbs the red miso broth. The cherry tomato added acidity to the dish, together with a earthy shiitake mushroom. Black Barley + Uni ($35.80). Definitely a very creative creation and a more healthy version of risotto. I experienced variety of texture in my mouth from the crunchy barley, springy and tender octopus plus the creamy velvety texture of the uni. A marriage between Japanese and Italian cuisine. Two thumbs up for creativity, however it can be an acquired taste. Roasted Pork Shoulder 1.6kg ($88.80). For those suckling pig lover like me, this is a must try dish. Perfectly roasted Zaragoza pork shoulder, with paper thin crackling. The meat is just tender and succulent without any hint of gaminess. The truffled green tomato chutney complement the meat nicely while the salad with balsamic dressing below the pork provided enough acidity to balance the fattiness in the piggy. Absolutely Gorgeous!!It is so much better than most Spanish suckling pig in most of Spanish restaurant in Singapore. The portion is good for 4 or more. To avoid any disappointment, please order in advance. Our carbo fixed for the night is Truffle Hiyashi Somen ($15.80). Cold somen tossed with confit egg yolk & shio konbu, topped with truffle molecules & sakura ebi. A smooth and springy noodle, well infused with truffle. The sakura ebi added a clean salty taste with chewy texture, while the truffle molecules give this dish a crunch and caviar feel to it. A good end of the dish. *Please note that the shave truffle is not part of this dish, just an extra Ompph by Chef Angus Chow on the night.Dessert was Truffle Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e ($8.80). A smooth, solid, lightly truffle infused cr√®me br√ªl√©e with a crackling sugar glaze on top. Warabi Mochi ($6.80). A more subtle flavoured desserts, slightly chewy and well coated with soy bean flavour. Ambiance of the restaurant in intimate and cosy, accompanied with good jazz music at the background. Good place to relax and chilled with your friends while you feast upon the food and drink. Overall, we were well overdosed by truffle in a good sense. The creativity of team at Boruto really impressed me. The Roasted Pork Shoulder, Truffle Hiyashi Somen, Kani Croquttes and Yu Sheng is a must try here. Kanpai!! Cheers!

We loved this place and Angus Chow! A Chef with lots of good food ideas, he whips up tapas after tapas of bar bites to go with our sake.Coming here for sake is like commissioning a free flowing tap open to let sake wash down the throat. Sounds heavenly, doesn't it! Boruto has a very good selection of sake ranging from ginjo to daiginjo to juyondai. Shouting many labels from tatenokawa, kokuryo, born, isojiman, dassai and many more, the owner really knows his sake and stocks the cellar well. Tip- level two is so much nicer with the cellar at easy reach! :

Established in May 2015, Boruto Singapore is a modern izakaya gastrobar, offering creative and exciting small plates alongside an extensive range of Japanese sake. Taking its name from the former tenants, a bank, Boruto Singapore is poised a stone's throw away from the Central Business District in Singapore, and regularly draws a crowd of executives in the evenings.Ambience at Boruto Singapore is modern and sleek, exuding a Prohibition-era secret vibe. Dark black and wooden furniture lines the bare, smooth concrete floor. Against the wall, rows upon rows of sake casks are stacked to the ceiling. Bright spotlights cut through the shadows, creating an interplay of light and darkness. On the 2nd floor, the former vault, now repurposed, guards a cache of sake, its solid heavy metal door acting as decor. Choose to sit over the counter, where you can watch the chefs at work in the open theatre kitchen, or observe as the bartenders mix your drinks.Service at Boruto Singapore is professional and courteous. I note that staff are efficient and helpful, offering to clear away empty / dirty plates when you're done. They display good product knowledge, able to introduce and briefly describe dishes upon presentation. While they offered goodbyes when we left, oddly, they missed out on greetings when we arrived. I like that the staff also engage diners in conversation, offering a personalised attentiveness, making people feel welcomed.Food at Boruto Singapore is best described as creative, unique, and exciting, a fusion cuisine. Call it modern Japanese or modern Singaporean, they specialise in small plates / tapas / sharing snacks, executing each dish to pretty high standards. Bold in taste, each features 1 or 2 key ingredients which really stand out. Part of the appreciation is having the staff inform you how the dish is created, which enables you to enjoy the layers of taste. Portions are tapas sharing size, meant for communal dining. They've kept prices relatively lower than a restaurant, though I feel it's priced similar to other gastrobars. Budget SGD $58 per person for a full meal here

So you have two cities and any restaurant to enjoy your birthday dinner in... Boruto was such a lucky choice, Fantastic food (I usually don't like fusion cuisine), great service and just so easy to enjoy. Japanese classics riffed with powerhouse Spanish flavours just works so well here. We will be back
5
I have to say this is by far one of the better japanese food in sg. The dishes are well prepared and innovative.
4
Always love coming here cos of the friendly and welcoming vibes. Wide range of sakes to choose from and the tapas are amazing too. Go for the fried fish skin and the truffle somen.
4
This unassuming restaurant punches well above its weight once you get in off the rather nondescript street and into the cosy interior. Fantastic selection of food, smaller bites to bigger dishes. The tuna and oysters were amazing. Loads of different sake to try too!
4
If you are like me and you appreciate a good uni pasta, Boruto is the go to place to satisfy the crave. Add to that, the sake selection... leaves me wanting.
Unfortunately, they didn't serve uni pasta today and I was left disappointed.
5
Boruto has some great sake, thats for sure. My team has a mix Japanese and they love the place. And as you know, if the Japanese love it, its a good place. We often have our team drinks there and even when visitors from other centers visit us, this place is often the first to pop up among the discussions. Great drinks, decent service anf the food is tasty though the portion is quite small. Overall, slightly on the pricey side but if you are willing to blow your budget on a great night with a good flow of good sake, this is the place to go
5
We found this place by accident, it looked very enticing and did not disappoint! Sake menu is very detailed, and the staff are very knowledgable is assisting with the sake selection. Served in a genius little carafe, with a separate central ice compartment, keeps the sake cold but does not dilute it. Brilliant!We tried a couple of bar snacks as well, the crispy salmon skin, yummy & interesting!Other menu items liked delish too
3
A cozy tapas sake bar with friendly service crew around make you feel want to come back.The price of the food is reasonable. If you are there, ask for the "10:10" menu, the tapas is $10 and the beer is at $10.Personally I do not recommend the Uni Pasta, the pasta and the uni doesn't blend well, it only looks "grand".I like the kani + kaiso salad, very refreshing and appetizingThe green mussels are fresh and juicy, it serve with toast bread
5
Refined Japanese/French fusion.The outside has nothing different from any average Japanese restaurant but if you take the plunge into the menu it will excite your curiosity with a fresh breeze of modern Japanese / western fusion cuisine. The result in the plate is eyes and mouth pleasing.The next thing you know is that you want to come back and try the test of the menu.Not cheap but worth it
5
Between my 3 friends and I, we ordered around 10 tapas to share, with some excelling more than others (the beef short rib, truffle cold somen and crispy chicken roll were particularly spectacular and the beef saga tataki and Hokkaido scallops were just about above average). We also had around 1-2 happy hour / promo drinks each, and our very enjoyable dinner experience came up to ~$70/pax. Ambience and service were pleasant
4
Dinner and drinking session for 2Clean design, upmarket feel. I like the lighting of this place.Staff and Service: Varies.....it is normally excellent but sometimes they do get maxed out when the crowds arrive.The highlight of this place is the variety of Sake available. We were brought to a "Vault" on the second floor to view some limited bottles. $350 and above bottles of Sake......pricey. But we had to try.....and the recommended bottle was good!!The food: fusion.....some done well, some not so. The Uni pasta was good, but some of the other dishes didn't quite go down so well. Overall: Great place for conversations and Sake. But this place is PRICEY!! and the level of food kinda doesn't live up to the amount of money your forking out for it. IF this place improves on the "Value for Money" factor, it will be a regular place for me to hangout
4
We had ordered almost all the happy hour food, it was excellent.
Staff were courteous prompt and very helpful with saki choices.
4
Excellent service from the staff of Boruto for acceding my request to cook a baby meal for my son! Also they prepared a cake for my husband birthday!
4
Saw some reviews online and decided to give this place a try!
The food was surprisingly very good! Only thing to fault was that the portions were quite small.
Loved the ebi tempura donburi!
4
Love the 10 for 10 promotion. Great value! Family always enjoy the food & drinks here. Lights are very dim though.
5
Truffle Creme Br√ªl√©e with a nice glass of Sake!! Delicious!!
My partner loved the warm chocolate surprise with ice cream!
5
Visited on a Saturday night and had several tapas to go with the sake. Only on Saturday, there is the 10 dishes for $10 menu, on top of the ala carte menu.The Hiroshima oysters is plump and fresh, and comes topped with a dollop of caviar. Another highlight is the Tori Take which turns out to be surprisingly good given its unassuming appearance. The tender chicken roulade is stuffed with tasty shiitake jam whereas the skin is fried to a thin crispy layer. My favorite goes to the Hiyashi somen with truffle and sakura ebi, which is devoured within minutes.The warabi mochi also stands out perfectly. Made in house, it is so soft that it literally melts in the mouth!Even the sake we are introduced to, ranging from dry to sweet ones, pairs well with the different dishes we have. Of course, the meal is also enriched through Boruto's stellar team and Chef Angus for his warm hospitality
5
My husband booked the restaurant and prepared everyone in advance in case we were disappointed, especially me, as I'm always skeptical and almost always proven right unfortunately..BUT we loved it! The spicy tuna with black olives was an excellent starter, left us wanting more.Other must haves include the mussels soup with a delicious garlic broth that you dip bread into. The chicken donburi was very tasty, the chicken nicely cooked.My sons enjoyed the cheesy potato mentaiko. And don't miss the sashimi set, which comes with tiny globules of soya sauce and yuzu sauce..The $10 per glass of sake was value for money, my husband had 3..I would have liked a more thorough wine list which is about the only complaint I might have.Will definitely return and encouraged you all to try it at least once
3
They really try with the food and it turned out ok. More experienced chefs typically try to bring out the natural Flavours of the ingredients. At this place, the sauces, jus etc drown out the natural Flavours of the main ingredients. The consomm√É¬© was a little salty and was cloudy...looked more like a broth. Plating for food was good though.The staff try also but inexperienced. We asked for a counter seat and they squeezed us next to another couple even though the rest of the counter was empty. Asked if they were going to be busy and they said yes....and of course for the rest of the night (we were there for 2.5 hours) no one else turned up...so basically ended up maneuvering for space while the rest of the counter was empty. Also, the lights at our end of the counter was off...apparently there wasn't any bulbs in the sockets. Further, where we sat, they used this end of the counter to store glasses, boxes etc, so it really defeats the purpose of a counter seat where you're supposed to watch the chefs in action. The whole seating felt as if we sat in a section of the restaurant that was closed off.It's a good place to go if you're looking to drink sake and chat...with food and dining experience as a secondary objective
2
A little surprised by the positive reviews so far. My experience on a Friday night was a total opposite. Given the fair bit of hype, expectations were quite high.Some memorable highlights of the meal included the tori-take roll and beef short rib. They were, unfortunately, followed by one of the worse versions of uni pasta I have ever tasted. The pasta was dry, tasteless, and the uni did not taste fresh. This dish is marked as a "special" and gets a lot of attention here, but is almost inedible and we left a good 3/4 untouched.The final dish, as we were still hungry, was the A5 wagyu steak. This was no better and the beef lacked any flavour. Rather surprising for (what should have been) a premium cut of beef.Overall, a very unimpressive experience for a total bill of $160 including a beer and a cocktail. I would not return
5
This unassuming Japanese restaurant's easy to miss, but do yourself justice to visit this place because it dishes up some of the best Japanese-fusion for its price. We started off with the ika geso karaage ($10.80), or deep fried squid tentacles. This was tasty alone without the salted egg dip that came alongside. Somehow our table managed to cause a sell-out of this dish, that's how addictive it was.Eringi "pasta" ($13.80) came in the form of tubular mushrooms. This came topped with a perfect, almost jelly-like egg yolk. As tasty, if not more so than your usual flour-based pasta, minus the carbs. The 58C beef short ribs ($18.80) was conveniently cut into small cubes for ease of sharing. Yet managed to be lightly seared outside and pink in the middle, retaining all its beefy juices.Truffle hiyashi somen ($15.80) with truffle molecules and sakura ebi was the star of evening. Each mouthful was a beautiful medley of flavours and textures.Now don't you leave without trying desserts. The spanish pain perdu ($12.80) was beautifully done. A moist buttery broiche dusted with sugary cinnamon. Oh so good.Granted you're not going to get top notch service for the price you're paying. But all the better for laid-back conversations and cheerful banter. I'll highly recommend this place for anyone looking for somewhere casual to chill out after work
