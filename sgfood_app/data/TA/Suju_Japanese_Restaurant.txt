They have a nice vegetarian set that is tasty albeit with limited variety. You don't have to request in advance. The setting is really good. I recommend a reservation especially if you want to go over the weekends.

The best and most unique thing about Suju is the rice. The home-style food is quite good, but not memorable or refined enough to justify the high prices - about $90 per person at lunch.

Great Japanese food on Orchard Road. While sitting at counter table you can enjoy view on chefs preparing great dishes
Sushi's and shashimi's are delicious and tempura's are good
Service is efficient and friendly to so so depending on your luck with waitresses

Very good Japanese food right here at Orchard. Both the chicken, cod fish and pork dishes were excellent! The California maki can be improved more, the ingredients not so tightly rolled. The rice set was really good, expensive though. Service was prompt and attentive.

We went here to have dinner before watching movie. This restaurant serves very good japanese food, either itâ€™s grilled chicken, gindara or fish. They were fresh and taste nice. Ambience is good, services are fast and efficient. Pricing is considered relatively high though. A good place to have nice Japanese food in Orchard area.

It was THE BES

Eating here made our day! We found baby mushrooms in our miso soup just like how it is served at our favourite Japanese restaurant where we are from. Other than being so pleased with the miso soup with mushrooms, we were very happy with the grilled salmon with salt, grilled mackerel and fried chicken. The mains with accompanying side dishes were well prepared and of good quality. Very happy that service was efficient. We plan to dine here often now! Thank you

This restaurant has been very famous for its uniqueness and high quality in Japan for a long time however I have not had a chance to go in Japan yet. So it was really exciting to visit them for the first time.The quality of food as well as service are quite good and the price for lunch compared with location and quality is quite reasonable, I should say
5
I come here regularly, with friends, for business, with family.Service is polite and efficient and the food is consistently good.The tofu salad, cod, chicken in vinegar, ginkgo, sashimi, pork with ginger are all tasty and fresh, The rice is always cooked to perfection. Must make reservations! It is very popular
5
I like the japanese rice here because the rice is sticky, shining & taste good. Not all the japanese restaurant the rice are sticky and nice. The gindara taste good too but have a lot of bones. The food serving is fast and the service is good
4
Loved the classic Japanese dishes made of miso and Kurozu / ponzu ( different types of Japanese vinegar). Tried natsu ( eggplant) with miso and grilled sea bream and fried chicken and sashimi by the chef.
4
Enjoyed the food had sashimi, maguro avocado salad and chicken, didn't like the chicken too much but that's would just me!
Service was great! Not the cheapest in town but good enough value

The title tells it all. We really love going to Suju, all food so far was excellent and service and ambiance is also nice. We can highly recommend visiting Suju...

I was there with my family couple of days ago for dinner and pretty average Japanese food, service was pretty good. You get a 30$ voucher for you next visit, I don't think I will be in a hurry to return.

How I loved the freshness of the fish I ordered. It was so well prepared that I just ate up every morsel of flesh including meticulously disassembling the head. Loved the miso too. Well stocked and thoughtfully enriched. The beef was cooked just right, medium and juicy.
5
A very nice surprise. The food was wonderful. We had a rather large party, so we had a feast and most dishes were shared amongst the table. All the food was very well prepared, we did not have any problems. The taste was very authentic Japanese flavours. My wife is Japanese, and I have spent over 10 years in Japan, so I hope we understand what is considered authentic flavour. It is a little bit expensive, the Wagyu steak clocks in at around $150 SGD (and my son did not share any :-( Overall we thought the place was great. The place was busy, reservation recommended for peak periods. Service was pretty good as well. This is now our favorite Japanese restaurant in Singapore. Overall an extremely satisfying dining experience. Well done Suju

Suju was recommended by my Japanese hairstylist and it didn't disappoint! Authentic food like you are in Japan! The menu is a little confuse to read. I got our friendly waiter to recommend and she did an excellent job! We had the signature miso cord, and beef cheek. Both almost melted in your mouth. Sashimi was also fresh and the king prawn tempura... yum! The quality to the food is amazing, down to your grain of rice. All imported from Japan. The rice is fluffy, sticky and shiny. Take the time to read the history of the restaurant on its menu. Lastly, sorry didn't have much time to take pictures of the food, we were all too excited to eat
4
From the outside and even upon entering, Suju looks very casual and the expectation is not very high. But when the food arrives it is really appealing and of excellent quality. The service is also very good. A really excellent restaurant hidden in a really casual wrapper.

Found a hidden gem right in the heart of orchard at the mandarin gallery! Nice restaurant to have meetings.. Ordered the grilled salmon which was really fresh, but the salmon skin was sadly not done well as it was burnt. Great service and will return to try other dishes next time

Most of us have reliable "go-to" restaurants in every city, and we explore other restaurants for variety but continually return to restaurants with reliably fresh and outstanding food and service. Ever since we discovered Suju in 2003 we have returned often for both lunch and dinner. We recently had a late dinner at Suju, and we were delighted to find that the menu offered 8 different kinds of umeshu plum wine from different regions of Japan. We chose a Kokotou umeshu okumusashi from Saitama. It is a delicious mixture of a sour fruit and sweet brown sugar. It has now become my wife's favorite kind of umeshu. It seems a special treat because when we were in many cities in Japan, only one kind of umeshu usually was offered. I noticed for the first time that the servers are more than very attentive. Before they leave the room, they check the tables to see if diners need anything. We had an excellent gindara misozaki and agedashi tofu. Both were plentious and delicious. The bill was higher than in restaurants with less reliable food and service, but the value was excellent. Suju remains one of our favorite, most comfortable, and most satisfying restaurants in Singapore

My favourite Japanese restaurant in Singapore! It offers fresh food, with authentic ingredients. The food is light and tasty, and quality is never compromised. If you pay with Amex card you get a $30 voucher for every $100 spent for the next meal.

Food wise, they have always maintained the quality and standard.
The white rice is delicious.
Service was also very good.
It is a high end izakaya and the price reflects it. 2 pax we spent 400+ including 4 drinks.
4
The sashmi are fresh and tasty .Service staff friendly and attentive .But prices as compared to a couple of other japanese restaurants with such quality freshness are very high .
5
Staff service is good. Food is delicious and nice. The miso soup is special. Unagi sushi really taste like the one I ate in Japan before. Salmon belly super soft and juicy. But the price is very expensive.
5
Absolutely delicious sushi, fresh, tasty, great miso soup. In comparison to sushi prices in other Japanese restaurants in Singapore the food was not so expensive. I strongly recommend the restaurant for Japanese food fans!

A lot of restaurants in Singapore are closed on Sunday. Hence it's not easy to find a good restaurant for lunch & dinner on Sunday. Tonight we had a delightful dinner at Suju. We ordered Nutty salad and I always enjoy having salad in Japanese restaurant because most of the Japanese restaurants usually have their special ways to concoct the sauces. Do try the Jaga butter potato. They were fragrant, salty, sweet & buttery. Their fish, beef & chicken were fresh too. As it is a Japanese restaurant, you must try their rice. The rice is shiny, moist & "good mouth feel". Local & Japanese like to eat here.
5
My husband and I are regulars for their lunch sets (dinners can get expensive)... It's Japanese home cooked food at its best. A lunch set consists of pickles, very good Japanese rice, miso soup and a main dish. A pity it doesn't include a mini dessert.

This place is great for lunch! Good menu selection, decent prices and good dining setting - the noise level doesn't overwhelm the room and it's comfortable seating, they don't squeeze in the patrons like sardines :) Lots of light and the space puts you at ease.I enjoy this place and bring lots of friends, family and clients in for lunch. I haven't tried them for dinner yet.The food is wonderful and well prepared - but the service is very poor - so leave your expectations out the door and enjoy your meal and ambience. Apart from the chef and front office/reception staff - the table waiters don't smile, take and serve orders roughly which doesn't quite suite the atmosphere of the place the way the owner and head chefs would probably want it to be. Luckily the staff behind the scenes, reasonable price and food quality make up for the bad waiter service

Bad restaurant with poor service. When we sat down, the waitress told us that the food quality is reflected in the menu prices... which was so wrong. We ordered foie gras which had very small portions, chicken dish was okay but not great, wagyu beef quality not amazing. Toro was good, but for $58 they only give you 4 pieces. Overall, it was overpriced less than average food. Also, the service isn't great. We asked for green tea and they gave us Chinese tea instead. When we commented on it, they were oblivious to the fact that it was not green tea. They also served us a coke which was flat (sugar water).Disappointed in the quality of food considering that this is in Mandarin Gallery which is supposed to be one of the more premium establishments

Good quality Japanese food. Cooking style is more like home cooked food, unlike most other Japanese restaurants. They offer a variety of rice which is cooked when you order; so be prepared to wait a little after you have ordered. Price point is above average. Be prepared to pay at least $60 to $70 per person for dinner (before drinks). Service standard could have been better
5
Although the staff there are not so Japanese, food was very authentic. I heard from my friend who recommended this place that this is the branch of another shop in Kinja.
Will I visit? Yes . Very likes it.
5
It was the best Japanese meal I have had till now. Everything is fresh and delicious - miso soup is prepared from real fermented soya and bonito slices not instant soup. Sushi is very good and rice cooked perfectly. It is not easy to find - last floor of Mandarin Shopping Gallery at the end of the passage.Really recommended if You are in Singapur and Wish to have a good meal (just good meal not dependant of the cuisine
5
I walked pass this restaurant many times when I went to Ippudo next door. It didn’t appeal to me as it looked dull to me. Recommended by my Japanese hair dresser @ Ion, I came here with my wife for dinner immediately after my hair cut. Ordered all the Chef’s Recommendations, a couple of main course and a pot of Sake.Food is surprising nice, Miso especially. What I really like was that the food here is different from other standard Japanese restaurant. In addition, the service was good and so as the price.Will surely come back again

Ate here for a spontaneous lunch, had more space than the others either side, its on the fourth floor of a shopping mall tucked away. As it was just me I was seated at the "bar" which meant i could see the chefs in action. Staff very attentive and friendly. Ordered the tempura set lunch and had diet coke and tea, came to 85 sgd, so not cheap but not very expensive either.Food seemed well prepared and good quality, taste comparable to that I have had in Japan.I got 6 mixed starters, a plate of sashimi, tempura prawn (huge) and miso and rice. Followed by a dessert of some kind of curd with fruit, very nice.Atmosphere relaxed, no issues at all, felt right at home. Would recommend for a nice lunch away from the chaos of Orchard Road.Will definately return when next going through
4
The set lunches here are outstanding value and it is well worth the effort to escape the grind of Raffles Place with a short trip on the MRT to Somerset to take advantage. Lunch came to $63 for 2 people including tea. Set lunch included rice, pickles and miso soup as standard items. Polite and friendly service, no reminders required to top up the tea. Great value and good quality food

I had walked by Suju a number of times going to ippudo next door. Decided to try it out for dinner as there were many Japanese dining in Suju. If there are Japanese here, must be authentic and good. And it was!! One of the most delicious Japanese meals i've ever had. The sashimi was very fresh and well portioned. The stir fry oyster was a surprise, firm and tasty. The Chef's Special, duck with foie gras was a delicious combination. Tofu salad was most memorable. Suju is a now definite dining stop whenever i'm in Singapore. Price is reasonable for the great quality served. Service staff were attentive and very courteous. Highly recommended

It was late and I was hungry, the menu conveniently had sets for lunch and dinner that solved time consuming ordering. The set offerings that came was not only satiating but huge as they were rolled out by the manager, Fujino Takayoshi--- the delicate crunch on the Sushi and succulent tenderness of the wagyu beef.. unique miso.. Wow! What was best was a testing trio of sake to accompany the meal. Irresitible not to go back for more

Suju is now my favourite fancy lunch place. I can’t speak for their dinner service since I’ve never tried it and something tells me I can’t afford it. However, their lunch sets are superb though still on the pricier side (approx $30 less drinks, service & GST). They have a wide variety of lunch sets available – their cooked dishes are significantly cheaper than their sushi offering. I’ve tried the pork ginger and the daily Suju special and both were delicious. They have a wide variety of lunch sets on the menu so you’re bound to find something you like. The quality is just above the average Japanese restaurant, which somewhat justifies the price. Simple things like the rice is better and the miso soup is tastier. If you happen to be in Orchard and in to treat yourself for a Japanese lunch, head to Suju. Book in advance to be on the safe side

We chose Suju restaurant while most restaurants in the Mandarin Gallery were closing up at 9 pm. Suju was open until 10:30 pm. What a great find! The atmosphere was quiet and romantic. We had a choice of virtually any table that we wanted. The tastiest of the dishes that we ordered was gindara fish misozuke. Second was deep fried eggplant with miso sauce, and third agedashi tofu. The Japanese rice was delicious. We found ourselves eating it with the sauces. The waitress, who appeared to be Japanese, was friendly and helpful. It was quite a treat to be able to enjoy such delicious food in a peaceful surrounding. The ceramic plates and serving dishes were lovely. The price was higher than usual, but we felt it matched the quality of the food, service, and atmosphere

Business lunch. Ordered a cod fish dish which i rate 6/10 while my business associate ordered a teriyaki chicken dish which was rated 4/10 bcos too chunky. Read in a food blog which place was recommended for its rice which we found so-so. For the price will prefer Sushi Tei.
