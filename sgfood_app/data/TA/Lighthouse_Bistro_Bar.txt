Very exquisite cutlery and tableware. Good wine glasses used. Attentive and friendly service staff. Fresh seafood. Tasty food. Will come back again.

10/10 will come again... I've been to this place countless of times and back before they did the renovation. It's classier now, suitable for romantic dates to gatherings as well. The menu has also been revamped too but still as delicious (or even more if I dare say). The service was also on point as they are friendly and attentive.My favourite would be their Asian lobster pasta. The pasta is cooked perfectly al denta and each mouth was flavourful. The seafood was also fresh. It is downright addictive and I had it 2 days in a row, even my dad who doesn't favour western dishes loves it. Other dishes that I've tried would include the Seafood fried rice and the rib-eye wagyu which is worth every cent

Returned the 2nd time this round to have drinks and lighthouse platter. Asked the server to introduce us a Rose wine & the only choice in the House was good and very reasonably priced! We ordered a platter to go with our wine & that was a perfect match!
5
We had the steak and garlic squid. Both were excellent. Great service too. Quiet place and very close to the MRT if you dont' want to deal with the bad parking situation around there
5
Never fails the taste buds . repeat visit and we often come there for lunches. looking forward for next visit.
4
The tile says it all. It was a nice place to meet friends and catch up. Food was good. N service was great.
5
Enjoyed the food with my BFF. Will visit the place again definitely. Great ambience. We enjoyed our dinner
5
superb western cooking, never fail us whenever we visited the restaurant for lunch or dinner. There were photos taken of the food, will upload when I get it from another hp
5
Every dish that we ordered came nicely presented. The food tasted just as pleasing to the taste buds. The staff are friendly and experienced. They were attentive and ready to make suggestions if they sensed that you need a little help. Iâ€™ll definitely come back many times more.
5
A hidden gem indeed. Ambience is great with excellent service. Food selection is mainly western but the Asian Lobster pasta is a must try
5
Loved it dine there tonight the main meals were executed perfectly. But winner of the night was pisang desert amazing! And the service was very good.
4
Happy to discover this gem! Food and service were both good. Enjoyed the lobster pasta! Craving for it right now! Nice ambience too
5
Lovely ambience. Christmas decorations already up and really put us in the festive mood. Very tasty food and good portion sizes. Seafood very fresh.
5
This is my second time visit, the fried tiger fish is very crispy outside and tender soft inside. Coffee americano with milk is very strong, dense and smooth. The aqua marine mocktail is a good choice to cool down
5
There are always new items available and this time, we ordered 2 of their new items, lamb shank and asian lobster pasta on top of our usual fav, fisherman's board. Lighthouse bistro has never disappoint us. Lamb shank was tender and served in generous portion. Asian Lobster pasta was flavourful. We shall return to try the desserts next time
5
We're a family of four just visiting Singapore for 1 x night, were looking for a nice meal in a good environment, this was great! Meal was excellent ( we had Lamb Shanks), and dessert is a MUST! I had the Salted Caramel Chocolate cake, others had Pisang Island dessert - both were perfectly prepared & presented, tasted superb! Recommend this restaurant.
4
Cosy bistro with friendly service staffs. Excellent food especially the Asian lobster pasta. Got the 'wok hei'.Not to be missed the spicy garlic prawns, Parmesan cheese garlic bread, Honey Charred Chicken & Salted caramel Chocolate lava cake. A great place for good food & wine
5
It's my second time to Lighthouse and I still love the food as much. I brought a different group friends and they enjoyed the food so much. Service needless to say, as usual attentive and friendly. I will definitely come again! *thumbs u
5
I am pleasantly surprise with the quality of food and service. The food presentation is good. There was few people that night, but I guess few people know of this little gem hidden in an industrial area
5
A stone throw away from Lavender MRT. A small and cosy restaurant where both the food and service is really good. The fusion “mee goreng” is one the highly recommended dish. You will surely fall in love with it. The manager Dewy is also very attentive and helpful where she will be able to advice you on the best wine to go with your main. Do drop by if you are around this area.
5
Nice ambience, great service and superb food. the food are of great quality. Highly recommend. Must try the fisherman's boar
5
This was excellent ambience in a setting at the fringe of the city centre. The mee goreng was delicious.
5
Tried all 3 kinds of soup, tiger fish & fries, lobster pasta, rib eye steak, honey charred chicken, smoked duck breast and lava cake. Taste of mushroom soup is good but would be better if it is thicker, wouldn't recommend prawn bisque to people who can't appreciate prawn heads. Lobster for pasta was huge and juicy. Ordered medium for rib eye but it's abit tough. Lava cake is moist and not overly sweet. Set lunch is available too. Service was great but can be improved. Love the ambience, great for anniversary with the company of wine
4
We had visited lighthouse bistro couple of months back. Basically there was no change. The ambience, the staff the service were as good as we had found during our last visit. Change was, this time we had gone for lunch and had moctails. We ordered Hot lime, summer kiss. I ordered Fly me to the Moon . I do not go to the moon but the mocktail was good. My recommendation to all in case you do not love extra chilled drink remove all the ice cubes. They only dilute the drink.On the menu were Gambas Aglio Olio, Honey Charred Chicken with Sweet Potato fries, Asian Lobster Pasta and Member's special lunch menu. Between five of us we ordered all of them so we could test all. All the dishes were GOOD.Worth a repeate.
5
Quiet & pleasant atmosphere.Staff is very attentive . They will clear away your dishes once u have done eating. Asking when you would like to serve your desserts. All was perfect with exception that the ribeye was still not cook to medium rare. Have to ask the cook to re-cook as it was too rare to eat
4
A very good meal here of smoked duck with lovely mash, asparagus, tomato and red wine jus. Would prefer fresh duck breast as flavour of smoke was a bit too much. Husband had lobster and pasta which he enjoyed enormously. Shared a huge plate of calamari with chicken floss to start - very yummy and the house red was just fine. The best thing - the very lovely staff with their warmth and great chat. Thanks.
5
Experienced waiting staff and fisherman board a good choice to pinch then talk. Location is near to MR
4
Great ambience! Friends and I enjoyed! Would be keen to try other food selection next round! See you next round!
5
I've lost count as to how many times I've visited this restaurant. I have tried different dishes each time I am there. It always exceeds my expectations and have me wanting more... The price is actually very reasonable for the standard of food offered and the classy but yet comfortable atmosphere. It makes for the perfect place to hold events as well. Definitely highly recommended! The staff are also very friendly and attentive
5
my family is a regular at this marvelous bistro - for all western food events.the staffs are courteous and the prices are very reasonable for a restaurant
5
Food quality is good and portion is big. The environment is nice, very few people in the weekend lunch time. The staff is very friendly.
5
The title said it all. The serving were bigger portion than we expected Foods were well presented and tasted yummy! Will definitely go back for sure
5
Me and my Mum visited here last night. We are staying close by and it was just a stroll away. Our dinner was amazing! Very well cooked and really delicious. Cocktail was great also! We are hoping to drop by again before we leave back for Australia. Very well priced also
5
enjoyed very much the entire 3 courses meal with wine, good value for money. got a discount as we live next door at Ciltylights 
4
It was clever of the restaurant to give their signature pasta (angel hair) complimentary in July 2017 for min. 2 diners with min. spend $35. Usually compliementary dishes will be sub-standard, but for lighthouse bistro, it was their signature. Well done.
5
Service is good, food presentation and taste is outstanding. Do keep up the good work. Will definitely visit again.
4
The food are nice and the price is reasonable. The ambience is nice too. The restaurant was neatly located.

Here is the answer as to why unique ;Light House Bistro Bar is located in the same building as Singapore Marine Officer's Union.It offers special privileges to members of Singapore Marine Officer's Union. As one of the privilege,once in awhile , as a promotion, at dinner time admittance is restricted only to members of Singapore Marine Officer's Union that too only by reservations .My son is a member of Singapore Marine Officer's Union.Saturday the 8th July was one such day . Reservations were made for 1730 hours.Light House Bistro and Bar is located in heart of Singapore and it's commercial district . Along with location the ambiance is under stated but pleasing..Staff is friendly and polite.Service prompt and efficient.We had ordered Italian dishes from the menu , which were , Soup: Prawn Bisque Main course : Chicken Comme with pomme puree , fillet of Sea Bass with sweet pepper sauce , Asian Stirr Fried Lobster pasta with Lumpfish roe . For Dessert Chocolate Lava fondant with ice cream . For drinks Tango Berry.Presentation of the dishes was artful and pleasing to the eye.The food was good and tasty . Value for money.The quality of food and service at other times and days is equally good.Strongly Recommended 
5
Ordered the angel hair seafood pasta which was delicious. Tasted like our local mee goreng but with better types of seafood. Beef steak was cooked as per ordered. Nutella pie was yummy!
5
Fisherman's angel hair pasta is a great surprise. The taste is fantastic. Recommend to go back again
4
Been several times when visiting singapore great location cosy inside with good service excellent menue street views ffrom bistro recommen
4
Great food at reasonable price. Though the selections on the menu are limited, the food is good and will visit again to try other dishe
5
This is my third time here. I must say the service is superb. The waitress was very attentive. And gave us complimentary coffee to compensate the Long waiting time for our food.
5
Brought my best friend to this place from States, she loves the food immensely! Her husband enjoyed his meal here and they wanted to their family here too. the food was so fresh and tastefully done...we will come back for more again soon. Thumbs up
5
Great service and food. will go back for more! Got a surprise birthday cake for the birthday boy. Great effort and surprise! :)
5
Great lunch spot.Great service and eating experience for work lunch. We were sat promptly and ordered the linguine with seafood. I wanted it spicy and it was delivered as such. Very good amount of mussels, prawns, and calamari along with mocktail which quenched the heat. Well done
4
Went back again with some friends today. This place has never fail. With its consistency, I am always assure that my guests will not be disappointed with my recommendation. Apart from the good tasting food, the staffs are also attentive and friendly. Though the menu hasn't change much but I am good with it as each time, I could still enjoy something I savoured before
4
Reasonable pricing for the ambience of the restaurant. Attentive and polite staff. Angel hair pasta was good, tasted a bit like hokkien mee though.
5
A great place to take a date out. Great ambience. Good food. Would recommend the place to anyone to have a good time!
5
It was an unintended lunch. Happened to chance upon and turn out to be a good experience. The food portions were generous and most importantly it was of quality taste
4
Ordered fish & fish and the steak set lunch during our visit. Quite a good deal as it comes with a drink. Price is nett too.The steak was delicious while the fish was a bit oily too our liking
5
Had a birthday lunch w my Friend. Both of us ordered the angel hair lunch set. It was really yummy and value for money! They even gave me a complimentary slice of cake (came as a surprise). Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. Nice ambience, good food and excellent service! Would love to come here again
5
super good food and ambience for an average price dinner :) went there for my birthday with a group of friends! would recommend :
4
Excellent service that gives a warm friendly vibe and made this a great dining experience.Value for money set lunches and the food is very good too.Thanks and will be back again
4
The ambience and service is good but one of the main (fish) took 45mins to serve. The wait is unacceptable but the server did apologise and offered a drink on the house.Quality of food and presentation is also excellent. On the whole,I would recommend it to my friends
5
Dropped by after my passport collection. Lovely ambience, kids-tolerant, patient waiters, carefully prepared dishes...there is nothing not to like about this place
5
I had the beef steak cooked medium. It was delicious and juicy just the way I love it. Mushroom soup was not from a can, and the mint chocolate was delicious on a cold rainy day :) I'll definitely come again if I wasn't on a budget.
4
Ambience : V.Good.Food : Excellent especially the Thai Fried Chicken. The birthday dish Salmon in soup was not that desirable as compared to the usual fried with some sweet source.Service : V.Good.A-La-Cart : General feedback from many members is price too expensive. eg "Mee-Goreng" Angel Hair noodle at $19.00 is too high. Some moderation in the prices would attract more patroning from the members.Compliments to the Chef ! Food quality and taste improved tremedously ! How about serving Onion Soup with Garlic Bread some day ? Overall experience : V.Good. Compliments to the Team and Management 
5
Went to Lighthouse on few days a go for lunch. The service was very nice, and the suggestions were great. We had the grilled ribeye. Both main dishes tasted very nice and the steak was cooked "medium" to a perfection. Also I love their wine collection
4
 Had a gathering with Friends and we had a customised set dinner at S$35++ per pax. This includes a soup, main course and a dessert of your choice.Environment is cosy and we are able to dine at a private corner.Fantastic service received from the waiter/waitress as our plates are cleared and water are refilled. If you have NTUC credit card, you will be eligible for 15% discount of ala carte food/drinks items.Well done, I will definitely dine in the near future. Cheers
5
Fresh salad and excellent steak for my wife. The steak was so tender.
I had the fish and chips. The thing I like about it is the fish had a nice texture to it because they use sea bass
5
Four of us dined here in the evening enjoying first class service and memorable food. Fortunately none of us drink alcohol as the wine list is very expensive. Not so the food menu which gives terrific value and great variety. We managed two courses each declining desert as we well satisfied. We rounded out the experience with excellent coffees. A couple at a nearby table ordered the PPLighthouse special desert which is the size of a main course and looks delicious on its own. Great value, great service and a great evening
5
Went to Lighthouse on. Friday for dinner. The service was very nice, and the suggestions were great. We had the grilled ribeye and the perch fish. Both main dishes tasted very nice and the steak was cooked "medium" to a perfection.Really enjoyed this restaurant and will come back again
4
The ambience is quite nice, next to City Lights condominium. There are quite a few URA car parks nearby.They served coffee on a tray. Coffee art was nicer than the average in Singapore, but not as elaborate as in Taipei.The char-grilled chicken and vegetarian fried rice we had were nice. The seafood linguine was not al dente.For lunch $19.90 gets you one of these three mains plus one coffee or tea or soft drink.Will come back:)
5
FoodI had a P.P Lighthouse.Out of curiousity, I asked what does P.P means,turns out to be Pulau Pisang.With the Caramelized Toast, with Banana Slices included, this dessert is best matched with a scoop of Coconut Ice Cream.(If you do not like coconut, you can try it with Vanilla,but the experience may not be as unique as Coconut Ice Cream).Ambience.It is a therapeutic experience sitting next to the TV, watching the slow mo process of cooking. With wonderful selection choice of background music. Not advisable for business meeting because it is way too relaxed.Service.The staff are well trained to serve us.Simply makes you feel at home
5
My first review. We had the salmon soupA saladA sea bass fish and chipsThen after we added a half bottle.of bordeaux Plus a pp Lighthouse desert. If we add items it's because atmosphere and food was really good.Cost 100 sgdWe will definitely come back again as it's unusual for me to be so satisfied with the food and the service.The soup was exceptional! The dressing of the salad was perfect too. We enjoy our evening. Keep up the good work.Highly recommended =)
5
Am back in SG for a 4 day stay. And I am drawn to come back to Lighthouse. Their aglio olio prawns has been a fave of mine... for years. I lived in the condo right beside the resto, you see. It is no longer on the menu. But they indulge me, always. They respect seafood! Their prawns are always perfectly done. And very fresh. Love how their menu changes and improves. Today, I also had their baby lobster appetizer. So frsh and delish! Love the service. I will never forget that they even helped me mail my Christmas cards one December when I was rushing to catch a flight. Lovely people. Wish them all the very best
5
after a show we walked from the laveder station to have a good meal. the place is stylish. calming music ad good service
5
We used this restaurant twice while staying at the V hotel which is opposite.The food was delicious. I had fish on both visits and it was excellent.The staff were friendly and service was excellent. The restaurant was busy so probably best to book. The air conditioning works well so was very pleasant
5
Lighthouse Bistro is a surprisingly good find in the Lavender MRT region. The ambiance in Lighthouse Bistro is suitable for group chitchat and romantic duos alike, so long as one does not suddenly look for space to kneel for a proposal. Despite its corner lot occupancy, space is still limited within the joint.The Tiger Fish and Fries was an excellent choice, the pacific sea bass nicely coated in delicious batter and topped with nori fries, which was better than your average French fries. The nicely marbled and juicy Black Onyx Angus wa definitely a recommended dish, one of the finest I have tried before, perfectly paired with potato risotto, turkey bacon crisps and sauteed mushrooms. There was simply no better word to describe the deliciousness of the meal.We enjoyed our dining experience in Lighthouse Bistro and Bar tremendously, thanks to their absolutely above par meals and magnificent ambiance. The staff definitely did a good job in contributing to such an experience, and the chef outdid themselves in preparing such a fine meal
5
Brilliant service, Great menu ,Excellent choice of wine,will return when next in Singapore.We stayed at the V-lavender hotel which does not have a restaurant or bar the Lighthouse Bistro is situated across the road which was really convenient.
5
Our club had our New Year's dinner here. Due to our large number, we were offered a pre-order set menu. Nevertheless, the food was great and the service excellent. Will definitely come back here in future
5
Tried the food because I saw the offer on groupon. Though we came using the groupon vouchers, the portion of food were not in anyway reduced. The staff were very welcoming. The food were fantastic. The price were reasonable. Go try it
4
Discovered this great restaurant on my last night in Singapore metres from my rather ordinary V Lavender hotel. Food and service and the ambience delightful. Scallopsxand Sea Perch excellent
4
I bought the voucher from Groupon Deals ! Value for money. Food is very delicious and not salty & oily at all. Will buy more in future. The only sad issue is that no children below 18 years old are allowed when using Groupon Voucher. I have to use the voucher for take away instead. Thanks to the staff who advised me to do so. Good service & helpful
5
Awesome dining experience. Welcomed with friendly staffs. Cosy place. Food is very good at very reasonable prices. We have dined here several times with different groups of friends and everyone were happy and satisfied.
5
Due to the work load, had totally forgotten to celebrate a birthday for a very closed friend. Remembered the cozy ambiance, decided to try my luck and drove to LHB on last Saturday evening. The restaurant was packed. No reservation at all...how? A male service staff (think his name is Andy) offered outdoor seating. Spotted three high stool chairs at the bar counter and he confirmed they were not reserved. Hahaha... luckily my friend was wearing pants. For the start, prawn bisque and salmon in milk were served. My friend loved the salmon in milk as she found it something special as she was worried about the fishy smell and taste. She took a few sips of the prawn bisque and commented she would guarantee return to try it again. Foie gras didn't loose her praise at all.Grilled sea perch and fisherman board were served once we finished the starters (thought had to wait long since the restaurant was packed). My friend was surprised by the generous portion from the fisherman board. Even though the sea perch was slightly over grilled, the tenderness inside remained. Andy recommended orange chocolate and caramel chocolate as desserts. When served, Andy and his colleagues came with a lighted candle on the dessert and they sang birthday song. My friend was taken aback and thankful by the effort of all the staff even on a busy night. My friend loved both the decoration and sweetness from the desserts. To wind up the whole dinner, I ordered a Latte and she had a mocktail. Even though this was my friend's first visit, she sang praises that the ambiance was cool and the prices were very reasonable for a "not" fine restaurant. In return, she will celebrate my birthday at LHB next year. However, only one minus point that she pointed out - time to change the outdoor signage
1
Don't waste your trip to this place, very bad service, even by using Groupon I don't think is worth it at all, can't imagine paying full price! there are better places then this, don't waste your time here. Ordered the grilled fish, fish taste stale, n the foie gras taste terrible, steak don't taste fresh either, the salmon soup taste sour!!! overall one of the worst restaurant I have visited so far!!! Pictures looks ok, but trust me they taste horrible!!
4
When I got to the place, I was really impressed with the layout of the restaurant and it was definitely cosier than it looks on the sofa seats :) Staff were polite and friendly which gave me a very good impression. I went to fetch my friend and we ordered our food after awhile and my friend was super hungry, eager to start eating looking at the beautiful menuJust some things to point out that we find the menu, although nice, was not easily readable and was in the kind of order which I guess I personally would prefer a separate drinkslist.Kind of wished there was a bigger selection of wine by glass with a light bodied wine for my friend new to wine to try out.Also our food was delayed due to kitchen congestion but it was just a Wednesday night so I guess it's a busy restaurant. I wasn't really particular but my friend was literally starving but good thing the food finally came and prior to that we were also offered a free mocktail as a service recovery.Food looks great and quite tasty and we enjoyed the fisherman's board but the mushroom on the honey chicken was a lil cold(not sure if its supposed to be served cold) I guess overall it's a superb place for the good ambience, music weren't too loud and friendly staff especially the waitress who served us
3
We first visited them last Oct 30 for dinner, arrived around 6:45 evening & it seems no vacant tables. We waited about 10 mins before somebody approach us, in the end the lady told us that no vacant table & all is under reservation,we can come back other days since we dont have any reservation for that day. Few days after Nov 2 we made reservation for dinner for 7:30.For those small eaters their serving is right for you guys.Food is served hot & seems fresh. We order Pink Salmon and chattered chicken(cooked and presentation is well done).Please note those who bought in Groupon voucher it was indicated that service charge is included in the voucher but the fact is when out bill came out, you still paying for the 10% service charge.For this concern its between lighthouse & Groupon miscommunication or what?
5
From the moment we walked in the door, we received wonderful customer service. We were hoping for a good meal as well and we were not disappointed, it was very good.
4
Good food good service.
will come back again
食材新鲜，餮前三文鱼奶汤，磨菇浓汤可口，红酒牛排与蜜汁烤鸡都很美味，服务周到，店内装饰优雅舒适，我和太太都喜欢，必会再来
5
This restaurant/Bistro outdoes most. The service/food/pricing is amazing. We really enjoyed the evenin

I was browsing TripAdvisor for a good restaurant to bring my wife to for our anniversary and I stumbled upon Lighthouse Bistro & Bar. So we decided to go there on a whim, and boy were we not disappointed!The ambiance and decor definitely made the place look more like a fine-dining restaurant - nothing like what its name says (i.e., Bistro - a small, inexpensive restaurant). We were ushered quickly to our table by a charming lady (Jesleve?), and given glasses of water while we browsed the menu.Perhaps the only gripe I had was that the menu was not very clearly descriptive: Where exactly does the Starters, Sides, Mains, Desserts, Drinks start and end in the menu?. I had to do some guesswork and read every food item description in detail to know which was which. The fonts on the menu were also quite hard to read, so in the end it was a bit of a problem when placing my order (guessing the food item + hard-to-read fonts).We ordered a Medley Mushroom soup ($7.00) for starters - the soup was really thick and "mushroomy" (though a tad too salty). The garlic bread stick was toasted real crunchy and still retained it's crunch after it had cooled down (how do you guys do it?).For mains, I had a Honey Charcoal Grilled Chicken (? not sure of the exact name but it cost $18.00), while my wife had a Salmon ($24.00). It was hard to fault the food - the chicken was grilled just right - tender, juicy and soft. The Pink Salmon was also similarly juicy and tender right down to the middle (which is often the hardest part to get right).After the mains, I had an Americano ($5.50) and an Orange Chocolate Cake ($10.00). The cake was a real doozy - the chocolate was pure and unadulterated. The presence of orange peels sealed the deal for me - this was really excellent orange chocolate cake that you would normally find at a fine-dining restaurants - not at a bistro.The Americano was not too bad at all - it was served on a coffee ritual tray (very nice touch!). The coffee was aromatic and light, with an Arabica taste that was not too overwhelming (unlike some restaurants that overdo the Arabica beans until the coffee is absolutely sour). However, the milk in the little jug was cold, and cooled my coffee to room temperature almost immediately after pouring the milk in (-_-").The servers were very attentive and refilled our water glasses promptly and cleared our plates without being intrusive at all. I would return to this restaurant for the food, the ambiance, and for the excellent customer service shown by Jesleve and her team of servers.Do note that this place is a bit off the beaten-track; the closest train station is Lavender, and is about 5-7 mins' walk away with no direct shelter through-and-through from the train station. So unless you are driving there, you'd best have a brolly in case it starts to rain
5
Having eaten in the restaurant our waiter suggested we took a look up stairs at the rooftop bar. What a delight, we were well fed and watered and really only wanted to enjoy the ambience and the marina sands light-show which the bar staff were quite content for us to do so. TIP this is a great place to enjoy the light-show from and I would highly recommend it.

I created a trip advisor account just so I can write a review for this place. That's how much I love the Lighthouse Bistro. Cmon guys, we all know the food and beverage business ins SG is pretty cut throat. And honestly, I'm tired of awesome places closing down so quickly just because people don't know enough about them. Even more tired of Singaporeans complaining that there are no nice places with good food or that some places have horrible service etc etc. If we want awesome places to survive, we are going to have to show them some support somehow. So let's spread the word!!!Introducing Lighthouse Bistro and Bar. What an amazing place!! Firstly, let me just comment on the fabulous service I received from them. Their whole team is absolutely amazing!!! How many times have you ever walked into an establishment and the staff greet you like a old friend? They seem so genuinely happy to see you and immediately escort you to your seats. Service is warm and friendly but the best part? They are highly attentive without being intrusive. My first time there I was on a date with my partner and it was absolutely perfect. We were left alone enough to enjoy a quiet romantic dinner and yet they were attentive enough to ensure our water glasses were filled, and our plates cleared. Never once did they interrupt our conversation or try to rush us by clearing our plates quickly. My second time there, same amazing experience. My friend commented just how awesome the service was and understood why I had ranted and raved to her about this place! Their service is amazing and absolutely brilliant. Very consistent too which is awesome!Ok so next..the food...I was blown away by their food. Their seafood platter was delicious! (Both times I was there, both times I had to order it because it was delicious!) Have tried their scallops, rib eye steak and sea perch. All the dishes were marvellous! Okay, to be honest, was it the most unique food I have ever had? Maybe not. But it was definitely delicious. The food is fresh, portions are hearty and the prices were so affordable. Do try their ribeye steak and add on the foie gras! Amazing!!The whole bistro is very quiet and romantic and perfect for dates or quiet dinners with friends after work. Its like a great place for a chill out session. Ladies, if you are looking for a place to gather your friends for drinks and food, this is it!! However, I think a Happy Hour promotion would go really well at the Bistro. Or a 1-1 cocktail promotion of some sort. Also, a bar bites menu would also work in this case. Or maybe a wine and tapas menu? All in all this an amazing bistro with really awesome food that will not burn a hole in your pocket. So guys go check it out! Shoutout to the fabulous service team of the bistro as well

Nothing special - probably won't be back. There are plenty of better places up the road, such as The Bravery, Antoinette, and the Chye Seng Huat cafe.

Lighthouse Bistro & Bar is a gem that we discovered recently. Conveniently located close to the Lavender MRT station, this is a good place for dinner if you happen to be in the vicinity.My dining partner and I tried several items from their seasonal summer menu, and found all to be appetizing and full of attention to detail in terms of flavor pairing. We had the Salmon's Milk Bath as a starter, the Australian ribeye and Pacific pink salmon as our mains and finished off the meal with the Orange Chocolate and Salted Chocolate & Caramel desserts. We also appreciated that each dish was delightfully plated and presented - it certainly enhanced our dining experience that night.It is rare that I have found such attentive and pleasant waitstaff - they are efficient and unobtrusive while maintaining a professional yet cheerful manner. In fact, it was one of the first few things we noted from the moment we sat down to peruse the menu. I only wish more places in Singapore would have such dedicated waitstaff!Definitely going on my list of places to eat at and I will return again to sample their next seasonal menu when it is out
5
Simply cooked food. Taste is good. Portions are generous. Had the seafood platter for 2. Honestly nothing too fanciful but good enough for the taste buds. Fish and squid dishes are well done.will definitely go back for more.Located 5 minutes from the Station.Ambience is good to be on the first date, wont burn a whole in your pocket.service is excellent as well, with each staff being attentive to your requests
4
I would like to thank the crew that served us that night! Smiles were always on their faces upon approaching customers. They would ensure that customers are comfortable and enjoying the process when eating and relaxing at the restaurant.I would like to shout out a big thank you to the lady staff - Eileen. Your service was fabulous! Your passion and determination and great service touched my heart! Im grateful to be served by you and reaching to my request! Your remarkable service will always be etched in my heart! :

a good meal at the end of tiring day window shopping around the Malls of Singapore also a bit jetlagged. staff were very attentive polite and good service.
5
Recommended by a friend to patronize this newly renovated F&B GEM. Was captured by the classy interior decor and the cosy ambience when the door opened and was greeted by a friendly gentleman server. Thought this fine restaurant food will be costly but I was proven wrong. Another friendly lady server recommended the food with great knowledge and patience as this was my first visit. Two thumbs up for her recommendation for the Prawn Biscay (soup), Tiger Beer battered Fish & Chips (main dish), Orange Chocolate (dessert) and a beautiful Teddy Bear deco on the Latte. Last but not least, the soft background music added another point for me to LOVE this place further. Many thanks to all the staff at Lighthouse Bistro for the wonderful evening and will see you all soon

Visited lighthouse for dinner.1. Service is excellent. It is a refreshing change from the poorer service standards of the cafes and similarly priced restaurants in singapore. 2. Food. 4/5. Good but can be better. I had the tiger beer battered fish n chips which is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. However, I did feel it was a little overfried and caused a slight tickle at the back of the throat. Thankfully the waitress took initiative and offered an extra lemon wedges to balance it. Great service! 3. Ambience/ Decor 5/5. Attention to detail is key here. Wide screen television shows you how the food is tastefully prepared. Quality furniture, tastefully designed menu.All in all, for about 20$ for a main course, you get the most bang for your buck compared to most other restaurants or bistros around this price range. My hope is that standards do not drop once they become more popular

Stayed in the V hotel and this restaurant was around its vicinity. Did not look very appealing on the outside, but, boy were we surprised when we open the doors. The interior of the decor is classy and cosy. We were greeted by friendly staffs. The food is amazing too. Specially love the Fish & Chips

My friends and I decided to give this place a shot for its nice interior as we were in the area and needed dinner. Based on the staff's recommendation, we ordered their fish and chips, and was pleasantly surprised and satisfied with the dish. If you're ever in the Jalan Besar area during dinner time, you should definitely give it a try

I really liked how the bistro looked, the decor was really pretty and it had a very homely atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed the Salmon in Milk and the Fish and Chips. My friend, who had been there before, also suggested the Fishermen's Board, so I'll be sure to try that the next time I visit. Overall, I feel that the appealing, high-quality food was value for money and it's a great place to have a meal especially for special occasions

Decided to head to Lighthouse Bistro with a couple of girlfriends for an after work bite. Was pleasantly surprised at my experience with the restaurant. It was recommended by colleagues in the Jalan Besar area. If you're looking for the perfect spot after work where you can grab a light bite, catch up with friends and have a cheeky glass of wine during the midweek, then Lighthouse Bistro is an excellent choice. Will be back for another visit soon if not for the wine, then for the Salmon Milk

I was walking around the Jalan Besar area and came across this hidden gem. While the exterior of the restaurant is nothing to shout about, the moment I walked in I was thoroughly impressed with the modern decor and soft colors that wasnt too loud.To top it off they even had a private dining area for 4 of us which they let me use as it was not crowded at that time. The starters were not just good, they were something I would expect from a fine dining restaurant with lovely presentation and very generous portions. We ordered a fisherman's board which had a generous portion of squid, fish fillets, prawns and mussels; the scallops, foie gras and salmon in milk. Of all these dishes I was particularly blown away by the 'salmon in milk' dish with its creamy texture and umami flavour that left me wanting to drink it directly from the bowl! For mains we tried the fish & chips of course being their signature dish; the angus steak; white seabass and Brazilian chicken. The steak was cooked medium rare as I liked it and had a lovely buttery rich flavour and not dry. The fish and chips were lovely as well but thought the sauce could do with improvement.We also found that there they had a good wine list with predominantly french wines at very reasonable prices. I'll probably come back again in the evening for that and dessert!If you're looking for restaurant with a cozy ambience, great food and value for money this is definitely the place to go

A friend and I were looking for somewhere to have a really nice lunch to wrap up our stay in Singapore when we happened upon the Lighthouse Bistro. The staff were great, the ambience was good, and the food was lovely. Heartily recommend it
