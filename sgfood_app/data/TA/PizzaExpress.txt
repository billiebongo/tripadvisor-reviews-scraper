We had the laksa pizza when it was on 50% offer. Although service was Abit slow as they missed out our order. But food was good

The dough balls were very good and unique, while the pizzas were average. I would definitely go back there for the beers (happy hour) and the dough balls.

Dough balls is a must have for sure! With 3 different condiments to choose from; pesto, garlic butter and one more.

I would say the pizza is better than the pasta. Food takes a while to come but tastes pretty good!!!
5
the pizzas were nice especially the laksa pizza. however, the mac and cheese tasted bland. the lasagna made up for it. the tiramisu was also good!

Restaurant was nice to offer my table a complimentary dessert (snowy doughballs) & they were prompt in catering to the dining requirements of me & my friends & their kids. Thanks

This is a great, fuss free, beautiful and convenient spot to bring your partner out for date night, park opposite next to Raffles Medical instead of Duo as itâ€™s much closer. Pizza was great and we were amazed by how yum the crust was, wine was decent for the price, and so was the fig pudding! They ran out of burrata on a Sun dinner though which was a slight disappointment but the ambience and pizza more than made up for it. Rounded up the evening with a visit to Mr Stork for drinks in a rooftop teepee :-)

Been a frequent diner at Pizza Express (Scott’s square outlet) 1st time to Duo..cozy ambience & attentive service.

Good atmosphere with open kitchen. Staff were attentive as well.
Pizza was unique and somehow different from the regular type of pizza.
The salad was fresh and nice to the palette.

I am not really a huge fan of pizza. However pizza express has changed my mind. The pizzas are not too heavy with cheese and the crusts were just right!

Pizza is nice, thin n crisp. Attentive service rendered. Unfortunately we ordered the chocolate fudge cake, was only told after we finished our meal that the cake is unavailable!!server should check what is available when customer place order.

pizza is nice n tasty. Food is excellent and price quite reasonable. The only problem @Duo is washroom too far.

Tried the laksa pizza. Did not have much expectations of a pizza with taupok but the flavour was great. Crab ravioli was the highlight of the lunch.
5
Service staff were very attentive and food was excellent. Delicious pizzas and pasta for the adults and kids. Materials were provided to entertain the kids and the decor of the place was comfortable and classy. A must-visit! Everyone was excited to come back again.

PizzaExpress pizzas are really good! Price is value for money too. Definitely a family restaurant and I would go back anytime.

I am still missing pizza express, the pizza are great. I didnâ€™t tried other outlets, the one I had was at DUO. The place is new and parking is very convenient. The servicing is fast especially when the crowd is quite packed. I will definitely visit again within a month

We went as a group of 9 people, ordered 1 platter of dough balls, 2 salads, 4 pizzas, 2 desserts and a drink. The highlight of the meal were the pizzas, which were delicious, as were the doughballs! It came up to less than $30 per person, which is incredibly reasonable, and super good value for money. Would be happy to recommend Pizza Express, and will likely be heading back again soon!
