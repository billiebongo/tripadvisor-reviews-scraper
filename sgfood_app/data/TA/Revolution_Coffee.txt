Its located in the Infinite building... location is very remote and food is not very special to shout about, although still good for filling your stomach

The coffee was as good as all the reviews said, and the brunch wasn't bad either. The kicker was the super friendly staff who were incredibly accommodating and seeming to be loving life.

The cafe was located at the ground floor of a office block, just a stone throw away from my work place but no direct public transport to the place. The dine in area was made up of mis-match tables and chairs. Interesting industrial decoration. For a weekday lunch time, the place was pretty empty. Help yourself to the iced water by the counter.Nasi Lemak with 5 Spice Pork Confit (S$9.90)Chef Shen Tan's Signature twice steamed Nasi Lemak (featuring 10 ingredients) served with ikan billis, omelette, housemade sambal and coffee sambal on cool cucumber slices, signature pork confit, marinated with coffee grounds and 5 spice powder.The meat looked rather fatty and charred black, but the taste and texture was just nice. Best to go with the coffee sambal. The housemade sambal was a bit too spicy for me. The ikan billis was quite crispy and crunchy. The rice was pipping hot and fluffy. Shendol Delights : Coconut Pannacotta with Gula Melaka Syrup topped with homemade Red Bean Ice Cream (S$10)Chef Shen's version of local dessert Chendol is a creamy smooth coconut panna cotta served with Gula Melaka Syrup, Chendol and housemade Red Bean Ice CreamThe panna cotta was rich and creamy but it was lacking of the coconut taste. The chendol seemed to be factory made as it stain the brownish syrup to a greenish colour easily. The ice cream was just plain flavoured one without any red bean in it, and with a too icy texture.Flat white ($5.50)Served with latte art. Rich in flavour

The coffee house is supposed to be well known for its Nasi Lemak but my lunch kaki and I were disappointed with it. The crispy chicken set was not bad value at $4.90 but it did not taste great. The rice was soft and soggy and the chicken was not crispy. It tasted sweetish. Drinks were very expensive - tea costs more than the Nasi Lemak, which does not make sense. Location is way out and the way from the carpark down to the ground floor involves twists and turns. Ceiling was leaking today when we visited. Definitely not worth visiting

Stopped off here for a quick coffee after coming back from nearby Tanglin Trust school. What a great gem hidden away. It is at the bottom of a big studio building and has a very cool, modern vibe to it.The coffee was really good, and we ordered some nasi lemak items, a beef rendang and a nasi lemak fried chicken. All items reasonably priced and very delicious.Staff really nice and friendly. Will become a go to spot when coming to and fro from the school

I didn't know what to expect actually. Small town trying to give people some coffee options only to fall short...not here! This put many other shops to shame. The barista cared what she was doing, service was great, the customers even had great energy. The place was hopping on a Friday night. Serves wine and food too.

I found this cafe while I was exploring more options on Google maps. At first I thought the cafe is easily accessible but it was a bit difficult to find it as I continuously stumbled upon wrong roads. The cafe has a rustic style furnishing with bottle cartons and wooden planks that are out together to make tables. The cafe is good for family morning breakfast and the cappuccino is one of the best. The service is a bit sloppy but surely they are trying their best. A good place to visit if you are bored with the usual places every weekends

Visited in a quiet Sunday to try it out as I had time on my hand. Had a mocha and it was ok. Nothing to boast home about. Vibe will be much busier during a workday as location is geared to cater for the office workers lacking on a Sunday

Decided to make a trip to this cafe, since it open on New Year's Eve. Very little crowd, probably due to the location and we got the whole place to ourselves. Service is good and staff are friendly. Food wise, I would say rather normal and nothing much exciting but at least cafe latte was decent. Visit if you are in the area, else make a trip to Holland Village and you will have more options.

A new discovery for us both! An eclectic,out of the way cafe that serves Peranakan fusion food at its best - Ayam buakeluak pasta and chicken rendang nasi lemak. Strong authentic flavours!Don't forget to leave room for dessert Pulot Hitam Pudding and Shendol Delight... different and delicious takes on traditional desserts!Be prepared to go into a food coma after this meal...
