Great hidden gem! Haven't had a pie I haven't liked.
Reasonable price and great service. It's a must visit every time I'm in Singapore

The service is excellent. Friendly staff. The chocolate cake is super duper delicious. Thumb up! Will definitely recommend this place to family and friends

We chanced upon this cafe after having dinner nearby, and at 9pm there were still plenty of flavours of pie to choose from. We picked the Honey Macadamia first and, when we couldn't decide on a second, were recommended the Strawberry Lemon as something refreshing to pair with it. And what a delicious combination they made! We were impressed by the generous chunks of macadamia, which was a delightful contrast to the smooth lemon curd. We'll be back to try more

We found this cafe at a quiet corner behind the main Upper Thomson road (behind UOB). Seemed like most of the customers were doing take-aways, or had pre-ordered, so we had the cafe to ourselves. There were many types of pies to choose from, and the friendly staff took the time to introduce every single type. We tried the Apple Rum and Hazelnut Ginger ones, and liked both. Drinks were not bad too - we tried the Flat White and Grapefruit and Chamomile Soda

The pies here are wonderful! Very interesting and quirky dÃ©cor with very friendly staff who would explain to you all the pies that they have. If it's your first time, try the lemon tart! It wouldn't disappoint. Overall, a great dessert place that specializes in pies (or tarts if that's what you call them)

Stumbled upon this place on New Year Eve 2013 (or was it 2012) and hooked ever since. This is the probably only place specialising in dessert pies in Singapore and they do a good job at it. All my friends have their own favourites, but I love the S'mores, cherry and the new Pumpkin Pies. Service here is okay, typical of most (hipster) cafes

Delicious pies and lots of variety! I had the strawberry lemon pie and loved it. I think between the group we tried five different pies and everyone loved their choices. Can't wait to go pack for more! Low key and I can see bringing my kids here during the day too

These are not your grandmother's pies! Many different varieties from the humble apple pie to the crazy Camp Symmetry pie, all with a summer camp cabin feel. Special note - The key lime pie has vodka jellies inside. For those, like myself, that do not take alcohol it would have been nice to know before biting into one

An artisanal Pies and Tarts cafe, you can't find other cakes. I tried a few pies but still love their lemon pie the most. The pie can find at other cafe or ice cream place too. Cafe environment is quite good with a very huge bear at the central stage. It is a good place to pass your tea time with a few friend chit chatting over the desserts. Coffee tasted average, doesn't give me a deep memory

The dinner venue this evening had been Windowsill Pies, known for its pies and tarts as the name itself states. The interior is pretty, boosting a "in the woods" theme with its polished wood furniture + floor paneling as well as artificial trees standing tall within. It is an eye-catching cafe for sure, and sitting by the windows I noticed many passer-bys stopping by to check the cafe out and taking some photographs.The Morello Cherry Pie came with the pretty criss-cross lattice design, instantly standing out from the other pies. The Morello cherries were sour but balanced beautifully by the sweet filling. The crust was a lovely golden brown, and was thin, light and crunchy. Every bite was a delight.The Coconut Lime Vodka Pie came with thin and crunchy pie crust as well, as well as satin-smooth lemon curd. There was a slightly tarty flavor to the lemon curd, but not overwhelming. Within it are transparent vodka cubes - adding a bitterish but lovely touch to the pie. The pie was very delicious overall, but we were a little disappointed that the "coconut" was not a flavor within the pie itself, but presented itself merely as the dollop of coconut cream atop the tart. The vodka - if infused with the lemon curd, might have given it a more even flavor true to its name.I had a Chai Latte (SGD$5.00). While my hot latte contained wisps of chai's aroma, the coffee itself was rather diluted.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/01/dessert-at-windowsill-cafe-lavender.htm

If you like pie, this is a very nice place to visit.
Interesting decor, good service and of course good pie.
The pies all have well balanced flavours, some chew-able texture to them and not too pricey.
Definitely worth a visit.

Excellent red fruit pie, ok burger, nice setting. You can tell toilets have not been cleaned for a while... Not going back, maybe only for the pie take away

Went there for lunch with my colleagues. Very good service and friendly staff but i am very disappointed with their coffee. their mains are average and their pie, which is supposed to be their signature, are average too.

My wife and I were visiting family here in Singapore during the Thanksgiving holidays. I had a craving for Pumpkin pie. Found this place online. For pumpkin pie, this is not it. Tasted more like sweet potato pie. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't pumpkin pie. I also had a coffee, which wasn't bad but if you are here in Singapore go to a local hawker stall for great coffee, if you want to pay more than you should for average food and coffee then go here

As the name suggests, this place is heaven for pie lovers. We ordered the lime vodka pie (heavenly!) and a grill cheese sandwich (if I'm not wrong, that's what it's called). Both of these were a delight to our taste buds. especially the tomato herb sauce on the side. The staff is ever smiling and the decor is cute, funky and pleasing at the same time. It is a great place to hangout with friends. Definitely going back

Had heard about it on social media and bookmarked it for a visit. It is around the corner from the hotel I stayed at.The grasshopper pie ($7.50; don't worry, there's no actual grasshopper in it) was edible. The mocha was just not to my taste, sadly - water was probably a better option :P As a tourist, I don't know if I would come back here just because. Also, what kind of cafe doesn't offer free WiFi for customers, anyway

The café is approximately 5-10 minutes’ walk away from Lavender MRT Station. Exit the Station via Exit B, go around the V Hotel Lavender and you should see the entrance into Horne Road. Walk down along the road, you should find the café within a low-rise building, directly opposite the Jalan Besar Stadium. Those using Google Maps will find that the app puts Windowsill Pies on the same side of Horne Road as the Stadium, but this is not the case! Windowsill Pies is actually located OPPOSITE the Stadium, so do take note!My friends and I visited the café at night for some pie desserts. The entire café was packed and buzzing with activity, but we were lucky to find a table big enough to accommodate our group of 5 quite easily. We got straight down to pie-business, and ended up getting 6 slices to share. The pies we got were Morello Cherry, Funny Apple, Smores, Strawberry Lemon, and Coconut Lime Vodka. As for the last flavour, I can neither remember its name nor what it tastes like =/ In general, each pie costs around SGD 6-8, with Smores and Coconut Lime Vodka being the priciest of the bunch.Of the six flavours I tasted, the Coconut Lime Vodka, without a doubt, won by a mile. Coming in at second would be the Strawberry Lemon one. The tartness in both pies was just right; and you really get that zesty, citrusy flavour that makes each bite just simply refreshing. The Coconut Lime slice also had the added bonus of vodka jelly cubes included in it, so you not only get that tangy flavour, but you also get the added heat of the alcohol as well. I highly recommend getting either of these flavours if you’ve had a full meal prior to dropping by Windowsill Pies, because they are just so refreshing that you won’t get that bloated feeling at all! The one pie you definitely want to avoid if you’ve had a full meal would be the Smores one; its sticky-chocolate filling is quite rich, and if you can’t handle the sheer decadence, finishing the pie can become quite a chore. The Funny Apple slice would be their take on the traditional apple pie with an added twist of rum-soaked raisins included in it; it’s nice taste-wise, and I think it would make a good choice for someone who is looking for something sweet, but not cloying or heavy. As for the Morello Cherry and the forgotten flavour, they didn’t really leave me with much of an impression compared to the other four flavours.The café also serves main courses, and their offerings apparently change every fortnight, but since I was just there for desserts, I didn’t get a chance to try. I would probably head down again some time to try their mains and see if they are any good, and maybe “re-sample” some of their pies as well =

The cherry and key lime pies are to die for! The cherry pie is amazingly sour with a hint of sweetness and goes very well with coffee, while the key lime pie has a rich flavour of vodka which definitely enhances the flavour of the pie. A very rich and robust flavour with each bite.The decor of this place is certainly unique and a must visit if you are in the Jalan Besar area.Pies are a bit pricey but give yourself a treat. You have to try it to appreciate its goodness!Tip: Avoid the lunch crowds and go earlier like 11am or much later like 230pm to get seats as it can get pretty crowded in there with few chairs to spare

Coffee and food is good but limited choice. Love the kong bak bao, esp one with the pesto sauce. The atas burger is good. The cafe is packed with youngsters and couples. Obviously not happy with the presence of families like ours. ;)Could be the crowd, we waited over an hour for the kong bak bao.
