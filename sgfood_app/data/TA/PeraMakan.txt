One of the most if not the most authentic and classic Peranakan cuisine around. Simple cooked for enjoyment with family and friends. Will be back time and time again for sure
4
Reservation via Chope app was fuss free. We ordered their 10 pax set meal and all of us enjoyed the food!
4
We manage to have a table at PeraMakan (Keppel Club). Ambience was good. Very cosy and comfortable. Food was served very fast!
4
OMG always sooo delicious and giving the taste of Paranankan after sooo many years. THANK YOU. Balualah, petal, otak, lady finger..... and Must Have durian chendol.
4
Food was good and very kind of them not to have corkage charge. Recommended and happy to be there. Please also consider
4
Peramakan has always been our go to place for peranakan food as their dishes are very nicely done. We had a good dinner with our relatives as it was the 3rd day of Lunar New Year and was fortunate that it was open for business. Staff were all very friendly and attentive
4
Maybe it was Chinese New Year special cuisine but our host just went over board to treat us to a complete feast of different Nyonya dishes. We particularly enjoyed the Chicken Ayam Kleo and the Ayam Buak Keluak, the Pork Babi Pongtay & Nyonya Ngoh Hiang, the lamb shank rendang was delicious, as were the Nyonya Curry Fish and the seafood Otak Otak (reminded us of sheek kebabs) had an light spice definitive different flavour. The vegetable Nyonya Chap Chye was excellent and the Apam Berkuah was a lightly sweet idli like new dessert which we tried. All in all a terrific feast of Nyonya cuisine
4
Went on a recommendation from the Lonely Planet. It was good if not spectacular food and a chance to try Perankan cuisine, as the L.P. suggested. Itâ€™s also tricky to get to, upstairs at a swanky golf club at the end of a long drive, so would recommend taking a taxi
2
waiters spilt drinks over my mother in law not once but twice! they sems to be in a rush while clearing the plates and don't seem to be apologetic. anyway the restaurant wasn't packed so there's no reason to rush !! food was ok not fantastic.. definitely is our first and last time going there
3
Average. Not at all busy on a Monday night. Food is served lukewarm (or the aircon is really strong in the dining room).Traditional dishes served with rice so quite rich. Desserts were ok. Kind of underwhelmed and would not return. Good value though, around $200 for 6
4
This is my go to place for Nonya food, cooking is consistent for many years. House wine by the bottle was surprisingly cheap. Good place to bring overseas guest to try local fare.
5
We haven’t been back in a while and we were surprise at the standard of the food. It was amazing! Currently the best peranakan food in singapore.
3
Average food for penarakan standard. there are many better one with reasonable price. Ambient is good no doubt, but again for the restaurant food is important.
4
This is my first time trying out at this place. The food is delicious and the ambience is good. We enjoyed our dinner. Good for family gathering.
5
Shiok Sekali. Sedap Sekali. An excellent place to eat PERANAKAN FOOD. I am a baba and if I can vouch for this, YOU KNOW it’s SEDAP SEKALI!
4
Is difficult to get authentic peranakan food with quality and price.
Recommend
- Ayam Buah Keluak
- Desserts
- Udang Goreng Assam
4
Nice place with nice food. The service is good and staff was attentive as they recooked our dish when they realised they forgotten that we ordered non-spicy dish.
2
Ate here many times in the past & enjoyed it. This time, however, was a disappointment; not sure what happened.The Nyonya Chap Chye was not even as good as a similar dish from an economical rice stall. The fish in the Ikan Masak Kuah Nanas didn't taste fresh. What's worse was that the dish was also quite tasteless. The only redeeming dish we had was the Ayam Sio where the chicken was tender & tasty
4
This was our third visit to this establishment in about 5 years. We started with a pretty flavourful Bakwan Kepiting, followed by the really delicious whole shank Lamb Rendang. Tried the Nyonya Pork Ribs for the first time and it did not disappoint. In addition, we had a generously plump baked Otak Otak and the Sambal Terung was very well grilled, tasty and not too oily. Ended the meal with an enjoyable Bubor Cha Cha, Apom Berkuah combo. Not the most affordable Peranakan food around but always satisfying
4
The dishes looked heavy but tasted good. Ordered ayam (chicken) buah kelauk and beef rendang, both were tender (the beef was a little spicy but tolerable, the chicken was not spicy). We also had spring rolls, which are different from the usual Chinese spring rolls and tasted good too -- a delightful change from meat dishes. The durian cendol has a dollop of durian meat on it and was less impressive to me (still good), perhaps durian pengat could be a better choice. Overall we enjoyed all the dishes we ordered
5
Great food great place best place to entertain business lunches. Authentic Peranakan food no where is as tasty
4
The food and service was very good. The Beef Rendang (signature dish) was particularly good. The service was attentive, quick and friendly. The price was not too low but I would say it was reasonable value for money.
4
Whenever I think of good Peranakan dishes, Peramakan is the go to restaurant. I've been patronizing this outlet for many years, and the staple dishes are consistently good.
4
This is a nice friendly place to go for decent Peranakan food at reasonable prices. The staple dishes are consistently good.
4
Good Spread of Perankan Food and the quality of the food is good. I enjoyed the food and desserts were just as good too. Will highly recommend this place.
5
We were there to introduce our friends to Peranakan food We ordered the Ayam Buah Keluak which is something very Peranakan The beef rendang was tender and the gravy thick and the spices well blended Overall, we enjoyed all the dishes we ordere
4
My dad likes the food here and he is usually very critical, so I'm really glad I've found a restaurant to his liking. Really takes a lot of guesswork out of meals! The prices are a little high but only because it is a mid range restaurant. There are vegetarion options too. The waiters are friendly and attentive.
5
staff was courteous and friendly. service was very prompt. we ordered 7 dishes (including dessert) and we are done with our dinner in less than 1 hour. Food is good and reasonably priced. the appetizer (crackers with acar) is a bit overpriced at sgd6 per plate. all dishes up to my expectation. good job peramakan
5
We had Sunday lunch at PeraMakan with family and friends. 5 Adults. The food was good, portions were large and the servers were friendly. It was a pleasant restaurant for eating and chatting, with the tables well spaced-out and a nice ambient noise level. I especially liked the soups, the lamb rendang, babi pongteh and the desserts. Highlight of the day for me was the durian chendol. Yum!
5
Ordered the set for 8 and it could easily feed 12! Extremely generous portions of authentic peranakan food. Service staff also let us swop some items in the set menu out for whatever else we fancied. Too bad they didn't have the durian puffs, but the durian purÃ©e was a clear winner and the best dessert would have been the banana pancakes (I don't even like bananas). Service was attentive and prompt. Definitely recommended for families!
5
I'm not a peranakan to judge the food. But overall I'm happy with the type of food and flavour. Service staffs are friendly too.
5
We all enjoyed the tender chicken and buah keluak and unique cincarok omelette and the eggplant dish.
3
Had an enjoyable meal at Peramakan. Among the staple favorites we ordered, the ngo hiang, lamb rendang & Durian Chendol stood out. Portions are generous The club house interiors has a non pretentious relaxed feel, & service is friendly. Recommended, except it's in an out of the way location in Keppel Club, near Vivo cit
4
Food order:Lamb shank rendang - decent but I prefer the beef rendang we had the previous visitBBQ fish - star of the lunch. Fish is fresh, tender with delicious spicy sauceBeancurd with seafood - ok. Would be better if they used homemade toufu. Kangkong - good but most restaurants do a decent of this dish anyway.
4
We brought overseas friends to introduce peranakan food.Food was great and dishes were served promptly. Service was friendly and very accommodating. Unfortunately, we were "upsold" and ended up with too many dishes. Wished someone would tell us if there are sufficient or too many dishes.Overall a good experience
4
If anyone wants to taste authentic Peranakan food then this restaurant is a must! Fast service with friendly staffs to take care of all your needs. The place is convenient to reach if you drive, if you are taking public transport then be prepared to walk all the way to the Keppel Club.
4
From an exclusive club to expanding their business into exclusive food republic chains making their delicious Peranakan food more accessible to most diners. At Vivo @ food republic. A plate of main course or dish regardless of whether it's pork, chicken or beef is $7.80 including 2 sides. If u r heading to Vivo. Check it out & u won't be disappointed.On a little walk to city square for desserts. We also found Kathryn HO, owner n executive Chef on duty at their first ever dessert stall. Training her staff. We were delighted personally make the rojak for us. Chendol, bubor char char were very good.
5
When in Singapore, you must try at least one peranakan restaurant - this one is a good bet. Located at the Keppel Club, so you need a reservation. Excellent service and food. Must try the Ayam Buah Keluak - a unique chicken curry with black nuts
4
Never expect to find such fantastic vegetarian Peranakan food so heartily prepared within Keppel Golf Club opposite Sentosa in suburb Singapore ! Its "buah keras" (candlenuts) mock chicken curry and 'beef' rendang are amongst the very best..Typical Peranakan desserts are just classic along with most non-vegetarian dishes too.The restaurant is well designed, spacious and comfortable catering for big family gatherings, with quality customer service at reasonable charges
5
Peramakan has always been able to deliver at very consistent and high level for its food. You don't feel that the food was mass produced and more importantly they are delivered to you at the right temperature. Most of the Nonya restaurants tend to pre-cook and upon order, heat it and gives a finishing touch. Ayam Buah Keluak was excellent, petai bring perfectly executed, chap chye was nice and the finale - appoom with banana purÃ©e was heavenly. Service was friendly and competent though tends to be rough. I look forward to be back..... very soon.
5
If you're looking for a really authentic strait chinese food experience you're at the right place here!

We celebrated a friend's birthday at Peramakan @ Keppel Club. We ordered the set menu for 8 and found that the portions were really generous. In fact, we had to pack some of the food to take home. We loved the beef rendang, braised pork ribs and otak otak. However, we do have one suggestion for the set menu. Except for the chap chye, the rest were all meat and fish dishes. It would be great if there are one or two more vegetable dishes for a more balanced meal. For dessert, the apom berkuah and bubor cha cha were delightful. Sadly, the place looks quite worn and the ladies' toilet was out of order. I wonder what Peramakan's plans are when the Club's lease expires
3
You don't have to be a member of Keppel Club to dine at PeraMakan. The food is good,but it is not the most delicious or refined nonya restaurant in town - more like honest home cooking. The decor is dated - 70's style. Service is attentive. Compared to more upmarket Peranakan restaurants, it's good value, although the very steep parking fee eats up the saving

REVIEW ON TINGKAT PERAMAKAN, OWEN RD. Date of visit: 26 Feb 2017My family of 6 visited the latest addition to the Peramakan chain at Owen Rd for dinner. Before we visited the restaurant, my wife recce-ed the place, and looked up the prices. Seems fair - averaging around $8-10 per item. It was my first experience with Peramakan, and I have heard good reviews about the food, so decided to give it a try. I was worried about the prices as I have heard friends who ate at the chain talking about how expensive the food was. Nonetheless, decided to give it a go!So we went in, and ordered a few items off the menu. We checked with the waitress and she told us each order is good to feed 2-3 pax. Hence, with the 6 of us, we decided to order 2 portions of each dish so that there was sufficient to go around.So starting from the top left item in a clockwise fashion, we ordered:2 X beef rendang ($10 each portiom)2 X nyonya chap chye ($6 each portion)2 X Penang nyonya pork ribs ($7.50 each portion)2 X Nyonya tauhh ($7 each portion)Alas, the food came. And the staff claimed to have combined 2 portions of each food item into a single bowl (see picture). Portions were absolutely PATHETIC! For 2 portions of tahu, there were only 4 small pieces of tofu ($14), 7 pieces of cabbage with some black fungus ($12), 4 cubes of beef ($20), 7 pieces of small pork ribs ($15). Left us barely full at the end of the meal, and hardly satisfied. WHY TELL US EACH PORTION CAN FEED 2-3 PAX, WHEN THE TRUTH IS IT CAN PROBABLY ONLY FEED 1?!Left the restaurant feeing disgruntled, and unsatisfied. The owners might have wanted the place to be more atas kindda restaurant, but c'mon lah - please help set your customers' expectations right at the start of the meal!
4
My husband and myself were interested to try out Peranakan food and were glad we did. We tried the Ikan Garam Assam, Sambal Kangkong, Otak Otak Makanan Laut, Sago Gula Melaka & Durian Pengat. No regrets with any of the choices. Otah was full of flavor with handful of prawn n fish chunks. Not forgetting the desserts, simply yummy
4
If you craze for Peranakan food, this is a reasonable restaurant to visit. Like the beef rendang, kang kong, different forms of fish, Ayam Buah Keluak, pickles/ajar. Chap Chye is so so. The environment is very pleasant and parking is easy. May not be top, price is a little above average but generally quality of food is consistent and good. Service is also good.
5
The day I returned to Singapore having spent 3 weeks away in London just for foods, EPL & musicals. I decided to find out the new joint that was set up by the same PeraMakan group @ Keppel Club.The frontage was excellent n surely the display of their signature Kueh Kueh, bak Chang, bringing out now the lunar new year delicacies were mouth watering. The main barie consists of many varieties of their signature dishes not to be missed. Chap chai, beef rednang is so tempting, At $7.80, a generous piece of chicken Maryland, n two side dishes. I decided to add long beans n lady fingers. It was simply beautiful, nice meat cut n chicken was so delicious that melts in the mouth. Long beans were not overcooked, it was crunchy. Lady fingers were fried with a touch of sambal that makes it so so yummy. Accompanying my plate of delicious meal was a generous serving of sambal belchan.Service wasn't like second to none. Cheryl from the n group managed the stall with a beautiful smile. Very friendly staff.It was so good that I invited 4 of my friends to lunch with me again @ PeraMakan next week.Keep up the good work.

My family and I are big fans of Peranakan food, having experienced the wide range of Asian cuisine, from the Philippines to Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Throughout our expat travels, Peranakan food kept grabbing our attention and is now amongst our top cuisines, though we love the wide range of offerings of Asia and the world.We had regularly gone to a more tourist-known Peranakan restaurant downtown. But recently my wife ran into some Peranakan ladies in Singapore who recommended PeraMakan and we had also tried and loved the PeraMakan outlet at Tangs. So when our daughters who live in North America came to spend the year-end holidays with us, we decided to do our Peranakan dinner at the PeraMakan restaurant at Keppel Club. First of all, it's a bit tucked away at the Keppel Club, so not easy to get to if you don't drive a car. Secondly, because of prior engagements that day, we could only get there at 8:30pm and that was the time of our reservation. But last orders were at 9pm, so the whole meal was a bit rushed.Nevertheless, the waiters were understanding and flexible, and we were able to quietly choose the dishes we wanted and sit back and enjoy the whole meal. We ordered the Beef Rendang, Ayam Sio, Mee Siam, Ikan Caram Assam and Chap Chay. We accompanied this with their Achar and a nice bottle of wine. The stars of the night were the Beef Rendang and the Ayam Sio, but we loved the Achar and the other dishes, too.We ended the night with some Sago Gula Melaka and Chendol to cleanse our palates, and these were pretty good.A great experience
3
They only have set menu for 8 and up, so 6 of us ordered a la carte. Otdered the usual - otak, omelette, fried fish, chicken buah keluak , chap chye. All were ok and neither excellent nor ba
2
The portion for each dish is too small for 4 pax. They should have pre-alert us to order double. Also I don't think the food are fantastic. Not worth a try.
4
The food is certainly among the most authentic and best Peranakan food in Singapore. Located in Keppel Club, the restaurant is open to the public. The service is attentive while the setting is basic. Affordable prices;
5
A very conducive environment with beautiful Peranakan decor. The food is great, serving real Peranakan dishes whose history dates back to old colonial times
4
We were lucky enough to celebrate the wife's half-century here with close friends just recently. It was my first time at the restaurant and I had trepidations as the booking was made from overseas (we're not locals). But most of the online reviews were positive, so I dived in. Luckily, the experience lived up to expectations. The quality of the food was exceptional. Service tended to be hit and miss, but I could excuse that. Everybody left with a satisfied tummy after dinner.
5
Its not in the center of town, the decor is nothing that special but all this does not diminish the popularity of this restaurant. The food is good honest home cooking styled Peranakan food. The Ayam Buah Keluak is particularly good with the restaurant providing spoons to scoop out the goodness 
3
This was my 3rd visit there and somehow I didn't experience the 'wow' factor which I previously was used too. The saving grace about this restaurant is the friendly service. My friends and I ordered the Assam fish dish and we felt that somehow it didn't taste right. When we gave feedback, they were quick to offer a replacement dish. When the order arrived, it was cooked and served by the owner herself, who profusely apologised for the error. The main reason was that the Chef was new and still in training. I haven't been back since and hopefully the Chef has since honed his skills.
4
Reasonably good Peranakan Food: Ayam Buah keluak was good but a little sweet, the buah keluak taste did not come through strongly. Also the contents in the nut was too finely minced. I would prefer it more coarsely chopped, Bakwan kepiting - not really outstanding, did not get the crab taste in the meat. But the soup was well done and very flavourful. Nangka masak lemak - flavourful and good. Ngoh Hiang - love this dish. crispy on the outside and meaty texture on the inside. For desert we had durian pengat - This was the highlight of the day. Very well done with strong durian flavor. Overall food was good and authentic but a little pricey. Service level needs to be improved: They appeared a little shorthanded and overwhelmed. A couple of waiters appeared inexperienced and could not respond to simple queries. I had to approach 2 waiters and walked to the cashier counter twice to settle my bill. Apparently only one staff was handling cashier and bar counter functions. I had dine there before and the service level was much better then
3
This was a favourite for authentic Peranakan food. Somehow this recent visit was a bit of a disappointment. The set lunch menu is reasonably priced with all the usual favourites. The fish assam was good with very fresh fish and the right tanginess of assam. The chicken in the buah keluak dish was a little dry and the beef rendang was not as flavoursome. Chap Chye was delicious and a healthy dish. The otak otak was a generous serving and quite delicious. White rice complements Peranakan food but here, it was somewhat sticky and slightly soggy. Desserts used to be our favourite in Peramakan but this time, only the durian pengat impressed. The apom berkuah sauce was not thick enough; the durian Chendol had a lump of durian purÃ©e that didn't mix well with the whole drink. Service was not up to the usual standard too. They were slow and forgot two of our orders.
5
If you do have money to spare, then come for this top class Peranakan cuisine, which serves almost all the usual famous Peranakan dishes. Excellent service, and portions which guarantee to fill you to the brim,Preferably if you have a friend who is a member of Keppel Club, so that you can at least enjoy a 10% off the hefty (albeit, worth it) bill
4
Ordered Kang gong, fish, curry chicken, curry mutton. Loved the mutton for its soft texture, they must have slow cooked and simmered it. As we waited for the dishes, we collected items from the pokestops. The is also a gym to train Pokemons near to the car park. For dessert, the durian mousse and durian chendol were fantastic. The mousse was made from D24 durian flesh, really sweet and delicious as it is
4
Lovely restaurant with great food. We usually end up eating here once every two months when we're craving their delicious beef rendang. We either do take out and take the time and really sit in the restaurant for dinner. Some recommendations: Beef rendang, Nonya Pork Ribs, and Nonya Tau Hu. We've also tried the spring rolls and they were great too. Service is very efficient. When we call to get some takeout, the food is usually ready in 10 minutes for us to pick up. BTW, this restaurant is located in the Keppel Club and would be best to go there by car or taxi as it's a long walk from the main road
4
Peranakan cuisine are normally spicy food but there's also non-spicy dishes. Popular is the Ayam Buah Keluak and Babi Pontey.
4
Had dinner here with friends. This place serves authentic peranakan food. Best to go there by car as its quite a long walk from the main road.
4
There is really a huge menu with tons of options. We even had an interesting dish made out tough wooden nuts open and fillet with a delicious sauce / Spices were very well balanced . Nice service . Friendly atmosphere. The place is located in a Golf/ Tennis club, and can accommodate really large groups. A great evening
5
My first visit to Peramakan at Keppel Club - loved it. Some of the best peranakan food I've had in Singapore, reasonably priced, atmosphere nice and chillaxed, service was super quick and helpful. Our group of 6 ordered the usual suspects - ayam buah keluak, sambal kangkong, braised ribs, ikan assam asin, beef rendang, ngoh hiang, chap chye, nyonya tahu and a pork/prawn meatball soup. Chilli sambal was so good too. Food was amazeballs. Service staff knowledgeable, helpful in giving suggestions and very quick to respond. Fuss free experience. Highly recommend
4
Frankly, this is the place to be for Peranakan. My two weeks back in singapore n returning to Peramakan makes me a happy boy.My first visit was on Mother's Day. I brought my UK's Friend along. He truly enjoyed the evening.Again, after my holidays in Taiwan n Shanghai. I returned on the weekend, as always packed with 3 of my friends.The curry fish head is always good. We had the traditional Ayam buak kelat, NGOH Hiang, chap Chye, sambal kangkong, n everyone had the meat ball soup which was very good. We ended the evening with grass jelly n bubor Cha Cha. Was refreshing, well prepared.Most importantly, service was always good. Staff service staff, many familiar faces that it's such a delight to see them over n over again on each visit.Now that I have returned to Melbourne. I have to wait for three months @ in September before I visit you .... Every week.Keep serving the best of Peranakan in town. Missing you much .... Till September ...see you again

Our family of 17 had lunch here and mostly enjoyed the dishes. All in all, the meal cost @$350, which was quite reasonable.We had several of,our usual favourites, including assam fish head (this was nice but some of us wished it could be a little more sour), beef rendang, ayam buah keluak, nyonya ngoh hiang, otak otak makanan luat, hee peow, itek tim (duck with salted vegetables soup) sambal kangkong and petai, and bakwan kepiting, or meatballs with crabmeat and vermicelli soup. We also had chen hu, a new dish for me. It was a salad and had rich rojak sauce, which I enjoyed.There is also a wide choice of dessert, including during penyat (a family favourite), chendol and durian chendol.If you park close to the club, it will cost $5 an hour. If you do not have the elderly with you, there is cheaper parking in the multi storey carpark near the driving range

Located in the rather run down Keppel Club, this place was packed with large tables of multi-generational families on a Saturday night. The restaurant probably does well for a number of reasons:1. It's pretty hard to find Peranakan food in Singapore.2. The prices are reasonable.3. Service is generally efficient and warm in the old school Asian way. You can see the servers are pretty flat out.Having grown up with home cooked Peranakan food as a child, I must say the food is average rather than stellar. Most of the dishes could benefit from a lighter hand with the salt. What we ate:A. ladyfingers stir fried with sambalB. ikan panggang (grilled red snapper topped with a tangy chilli sauce) - the best dish for us. The fish was really fresh. C. chincalok omelette (chincalok is a traditional Peranakan relish made from fermented shrimp, chillli, onions and lime juice)D. babi pongtay (pork stewed with fermented soya bean paste)E. bakwan kepiting soup (meatballs made with pork, crabmeat and bamboo shoots in a chicken and pork broth)F. hee peow soup (cabbage, fish maw and prawn and pork meat balls in a chicken broth) We also had an order each of bobur chacha and durian pengnet for dessert. We were a table of 4 and our meal came up to S$105 (US$78).Non club members planning a visit with older members of the family should note that guest parking is a bit of a trek from the clubhouse and that the multi storey building doesn't have any lifts/elevators
4
we were introduced by our friends to this slightly upmarket peranakan food in Kepple club. It is expected that the normal dress code and behaviour be observed, which makes this place very pleasant for family or business lunches in an airconditioned, clean and quiet surrounding.The service was excellent and the food authentic. It is a far cry from the normal stuffy, smokey hot Singapore market food courts. The pace is leisurely, the steamed rice is hot when served and top-up regularly by the attentive waiters/waitresses; This goes well with all the typical Nonya dishes.A cold lime juice or cold local beer or even hot tea to cleanse your palate for variety of taste challenges.The desserts eg. sago, chendol or ice kachang (with durian if you dare) or banana dips with pancake etc etc to finish one satisfying day at the clu
3
pros : parking is ample at the Keppel Club, especially at lunch time. it was not crowded. service is so so. didn't have to wait too long for our food. yummy, home style cooking. reasonable prices. the beef redang is exceptionally yummy, so it is the otak. it has a casual atmosphere. to try more dishes, it's best to come with more people.con : difficult to get to if you don't drive. cabbing it would be the next best alternative
4
I have become a fan of Peramakan since I friend took me to their East Coast restaurant a few years ago. Unfortunately the East Coast Restaurant is now closed so I have to come to their original out at Keppel Golf Club. A bit hard to find I must say.The restaurant has a nice ambiance - it was like the dining room of a peranakan family. Service was quick and the staff were polite. We had lor bak and satay for starters, followed by beef rendang, sambal kangkong and otak. All the dishes were very good and suited our taste. For dessert we had chendol which was very refreshing. I wished I had more room in my tummy to try the other nonya desserts.Prices were quite acceptable
4
Difficult to get to by public transport but the food made it worthwhile. Rustic but authentic straights cuisine - we enjoyed all the dishes we ordered. We will return on our next visit to Sungapore.
4
Had our family CNY reunion dinner at this restaurant. The food was excellent and the waiting staff were also very pleasant. My favourite was the barbecued squid. A great dining experience overall!
4
Came here twice in a week. Especially like the Ayam Buekalak as well as the Assam fish and the kang kong. Finishing with the chendol, If you have a larger group, the better as you can try more dishes.
5
We have not tried this restaurant for some time and suggested this to our friends, one being a peranakan and cooks well. Service was attentive and efficient. We ordered the set and ate more than enough. All the dishes were top notch, beef rendang was almost fork tender, meat ball soup was slightly salty but meatballs were wholesome and tender. Ikan chuan Chuan was flavor some, buah keluak was out of this world, Assam prawn was the let down being overcooked. Durian penyat was a lovely end to the meal, rich and creamy. Such a gem, Highly recommended!The food was grea

This Restaurant is located at Level 3 of the Main Club house of Keppel Club. It is managed by a true-blue Nyonya who learnt cooking from her grandmother and her mother, a generation of people who take pride and passion in preparing with love, good home cooked food! By blending Chinese ingredients with various distinct spices and cooking techniques used by the Malay/Indonesian community, Nonya cooking gives rise to Peranakan interpretations of Malay/Indonesian food that is similarly tangy, aromatic, spicy and herbal.The Restaurant is brightly lit, quite spacious being split-level and fully air conditioned, and able to accommodate 180 people including a private room that seats 25 guests. The walls are decorated with framed colourful ceramic tiles that are found in Peranakan homes. Other colourful ceramic plates, tea pots and Peranakan artefacts are scattered around the hall. At the entrance are counters displaying for sale, various Nyonya cookies, jams and sauces.We ordered from the Chinese New Year Ala carte menu a soup, four dishes and deserts. This menu has less items than the usual restaurant menu. Prices are not cheap.The Bakwan Kepiting and Hee Peow soups were served in individual bowls. These came piping hot. The stock tasted rich and would have been tastier if fried garlic in oil was added as a dressing. There was hardly any fish maw ( hee peow) in my bowl.The Ayam buah keluak dish comes with 2 nuts - you pay additional, if you wanted more nuts. The gravy was very rich and thick with the contents of the nuts. Tasted authentic, but I prefer the nut contents to remain in the nuts and a lighter gravy. The Sambal kangkong was a disappointment. The kangkong leaves were over-fried and limp not crunchy, and the sambal itself lacked ‘kick’. It was not spicy or tasty enough.Seafood Otak otak was expensive, and unfortunately dry. The otak was flavourful and perhaps a bit strongly spiced, but it was certainly dry and unappetising. Nyonya Pork ribs had a crunchy texture when you bit into some cartilage. The gravy was on the sweet side and this was altogether a nice dish. Our desert was the Chendol. This was refreshing, tasty and faintly aromatic with the black cane sugar. Very delicious.We ate the food with steamed white rice, which was charged at $1.00 per person, but the waiters do keep asking periodically to top up the rice. Our drinks were frequently refilled, empty were dishes removed quickly, and generally, the service was polite, friendly, attentive, and efficient.Upon sitting down to table, I first noticed the cloth napkins. There was also a small plate of paper napkins as well and toothpicks on the table. It’s always nice to see some attention to details like these as it does say something about the Management. PeraMakan is open to club members and to members of the general public for lunch and dinner from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm and from 6:00 pm to 10:00 pm respectively. The restaurant is available for private bookings for lunch, dinner, tea reception or cocktail reception and is opened everyday. There are ample parking lots at the covered multi-storey car park or on white lots at Club House.

Maybe this is authentic Nonya restaurant but not the best I ever tried in Singapore. We are very disappointed with the foods. Taste are not bad , but not delicous as what we think. Most of the foods are pre-cooked, served fast but food are not really hot. Only the fried mee siam are hot, the rest not really. Dessert , I only like durian pengat, the Apom Berkuah Pancake really the worst dessert we ever tried.  The foods do not inspire me to return to this restaurant again

Off the beaten track in the Keppel Club is a restaurant serving authentic peranakan food. Lovely combination of spices and flavored. The friendly staff are well versed in the menu and are able to provide advice on dishes. Excellent place to take visitors for a taste of food truly Singaporean

We love eating at Peramakan for the Peranakan food that is cooked with heart. Arriving 30 min past our reservation time we were glad that the restaurant still held our table for 4 plus 1 infant in tow.We were famished and ordered:1) ngoh hiang2) babi pongteh3) ayam buah keluak4) chap chye5) assam fish6) bakwan kepiting 7) durian pengat8) bubur cha cha9) chendolDespite it being a very busy time for the staff, the food quality was excellent and the service staff were very friendly. We felt so blessed eating there today. We will be planning for our next visit to the restaurant soon
5
We had several dishes there. All very authentically Peranakan, richly flavoured and delicately prepared. Really as delicious as it gets. What got our attention was the signature rendang beef using meat from the cow's shin which explains the tenderness of the meat. We loved the chendol too. Definitely a restaurant on my shortlist of must-try when in Singapore
4
There are probably 2 or 3 Peranakan-style restaurants in Singapore i would go to - this would be top of the listSet in the comfortable surroundings of Keppel Club, i recommend go as a group of 4 or more, so that you can order more of their extensive menu to share!!#shiok#nomnom

Coming from a Peranakan upbringing, I can say that the dishes served by this restaurant is very authentic. Worth going. Try every dish! Restaurant is spacious. Portion of food is a little small though.
5
Had a business lunch here with my boss and the food was great! Service was very prompt too.. The best peranakan food I've eaten in Singapore so far!
4
went as a large group.
great value.
good food.
dessert really very lousy (not enough Gula melaka in both chendol and coffee which supposed to have gula melaka)
4
Service is attentive. They got the timing just right to take our order, and were quick to clear away dishes and refill my beer.The dining room itself was not that large, a split level affair with perhaps 10 to 15 tables. I didn't like the giant wait station in the middle, repurposed from a buffet, but that's a minor quibble.They enforce a dress code of "business, smart casual". At least for men, this seems to mean button down shirt and slacks. I wore a sport coat and felt overdressed.Food is served western family style, except the wait staff serve you rice out of a larger bowl they bring with them right after your dishes are served. First 2 dishes were on our table in minutes, and the third was presented well before we had finished dishing out food onto our plates.Had the Beef Rendang, Otak Otak and Chinese spinach with sambal, all were really tasty. Desert was the Durian Mousse and Durian Chengdol, also good. I can't comment on the authenticity of the food, but I thought it was excellent
5
Go before the Club disappears! The kitchen is helmed by a very competent Bibik who churns out heavenly dishes. Especially recommended is the melt-in-your-mouth mutton rendang. Babi tohae is also divine, but the dish is seasonal owing to the availability of the prawn only in April
4
As a tourist, this was an entirely new kind of cuisine for me. I had read great reviews and I wanted to try this out. This restaurant can only be reached by cab or car. But it is worth the visit. The restaurant requires advance reservation as it is pretty full most of the time, especially weekends.Now coming to the food, I must say it was totally different and an amazing experience. I tried Ikan Garam Assam and the gravy was amazingly tasty and the piece of fish was cooked to perfection. We had it with rice and it tasted amazing. I also had Satay Ayam Panggang and it was again a great dish. For dessert, I had Durian Chendol as my friend insisted but considering I totally dislike Durian, it was a real bad ending for me. Overall, it was a totally new experience in terms of cuisine and taste. I would recommend anyone to surely have one meal at this place during their time in Singapore

My husband is Peranakan so we know what Peranakan food is supposed to be like. This is our go to place for family birthdays and other celebrations both for the quality of the food as well as the ambience. It is one of the few Peranakan restaurants which is a little more upmarket and celebration worthy and yet pocket friendly enough. There are a few other good peranankan restaurants around but they are more like cafes.We love their Ayam buah keluak and especially like the fact that they allow you to order extra nuts. The nuts have the right ratio of pork and nut and you can still taste the full fragrance of the nuts and the chicken is not too dry.Our other favourites are their Babi ponteh and beef rendang. Both are tender and flavourful and taste exactly like what they are supposed to taste like.For desserts their Apoms are quite soft and tasty.Parking is easy and a short walk through the golf driving range of the club. It is a little hard to find as it is tucked away at the end of Bukit CHermin road, a little off the beaten track.They do catering too and we have catered some nice bento sets for some events as well

I was being introduced by my sis in law for the nice cuisines in this restaurant. The prices were expensive but really worth it. Their lamb shank was delicious, super tender like Rendang style and did not bear any typical mutton taste. And their chap chyes were tasty as well. Most of their dishes were recommended. Been to this place 4times. Things you should be aware of, booking or reservation is preferably required. Especially for big days or special occasions. Many times they are quite packed or full house on weekends.You should really visit this restaurant if you are free. The only drawback is the location is inaccessible because you need to drive or take a cab to go in. Hope my review helps. Cheers

Brought a voucher online that suppose to dine at their East Coast Road branch which was near us. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed as told by them the Santa Grand Hotel made them to move out in 2 days! In order to honor the voucher, the restaurant made arrangement for us to order all dishes through phone at their Keppel Club branch, where we could conveniently pick up at their Peramakan Deli along the same location in the East Coast Road.I ordered the Lamb Shank Rendang. It was pretty good portion, the meat was incredibly tender and fragrant. Believe it or not, I happened to fall sick when the day I picked up the food. Unable to eat it right away, so saved it until the day after. The Lamb Shank Rendang still tasted very good. Another dish was Penang Nyonya Pork Ribs. I was unable to wait too much longer to try it out so simply reheated the dish by steaming it the next day when I felt slightly better. It is not as heavy as the Rendang so my body handled it well. The meat was tender and it was so flavorful! Tasted just like from one of those grandma recipes. Last but not least, the dessert: Durian Pengat. They used quality durian and it was a wonderful completion.These dishes were ordered as a takeout, I can't imagine how it would be like if we dined at the restaurant directly. I will definitely revisit the Peramakan Restaurant or even place another takeaway order from them. The lady at the deli was very friendly and had a good welcoming smile too

We had a barbecued squid, brinjal with prawn and ladyfingers in sambal. Total of SGD46. The brinjal and ladyfingers were excellent - five stars for them. Barbecued squid, while good, was not remarkable. As it was a takeout, the restaurant packed a generous cup of their famous fiery chilli paste for us. Thumbs up!I rated "Very Good" instead of "Excellent" only because of the location - too out of the way to tempt me for a return visit
5
Tucked away in a quiet corner of Singapore, PeraMakan is a great place for a relaxed satisfying meal.
At lunch, the food was delicious, the service prompt, and the desserts a stand-out!! A memorable meal indeed!!
5
I went with a couple that grew up with Peranakan home-cooking and they love this restaurant. The durian dessert was AMAZING and the sambal was so good that I had to buy two bottles to bring home. Really excellent stuff.
5
Location at keppel club is a little out of the way but worth the trip. Standard Nonya fare. Gula Melaka is out of this world. Price is riht

One of the better peranakan restaurants in Singapore. The food is tasty and the portions generous. It is good value for money.We had ayam buah keluak (a specialty dish cooked only by the peranakans). The gravy was not thick enough and the chicken was tougher than it should be. Usually the meat should just peel off. The buah keluak itself was thin. I do not know what went into it and it did not have the signature bitterness. The bakwan kepiting was okay. The meatball was again hard and there was not much crab meat. The bamboo shoots was also inadequate. Taste-wise okay. The ikan tempra tasted quite good and did the nangka cooked with the sayur lodah. The bubur chacha was too sweet but they used fresh coconut milk which made it better than those which used canned coconut milk.In all, my verdict is that it is a good substitute for home-cooked peranakan food

We arrived before noon to this restaurant. It's in a club way off the main road. Thinking it was special, given the reviews, we were looking forward to a yummy and tasty lunch.What a HORRID experience it turned out to be.Waiters and waitresses were nonchalant.We had to flag down numerous staff before we could order.We did notice the staff perking up by 1230. If we were too early arriving at 1145, the restaurant should not have received early reservations.First dish that came was Hee Peow soup. Oh my! It was lukewarm. Actually, it was only faintly warm. Oil coats around one's tongue with soup at that temperature. So, again a wavedown to get attention. Again the staff telling us they would prepare a new batch....and what came out piping hot later was my half eaten meatball....returned to meRice came after more wavedowns. By this time, our impression of the restaurant was down to an alltime low.The one bright spark was the fishhead curry. That turned out cooked beautifully.The other piece of dynamite was an employee coming to us to tell us all our wavedowns and search for service was disruptive. Oh my.We wont be revisiting this restaurant. It is lost in bad staff management.And honestly, although the dishes were not super bad, they were not worth the trek to Keppel Club.There are many peranakan restos around town, and yummier too. Plus better service.I do not recomnend this restaurant at all.The one star is because I was unable to give a zero star revie

A very good restaurant in a quiet relaxed environment which feels more rural than most of Singapore. The menu has a large selection of very good, unique food. We had fish, vegetable, chicken, and beef dishes all of which were very tasty. The desserts were also very good and interesting without being too exotic for western palates
4
My wife and I have eaten at PeraMakan a couple of times. For mains we had Ayam Buak Keluak, Ikan Garam Assam and Sayur Nangka Masak Lemak, and for dessert we had Chendol. We found the portions for the mains to be rather generous. However, the food was not really piping hot when it arrived, making us wonder if has been pre-prepared. The dessert was kind of disappointing as the portion was pretty small and seemed to be lacking in ingredients. The ambiance was nice. The staff were quite attentative though, and would fill up our glasses before they went empty. Overall still value for money, especially for the mains
3
This place is a good place for gathering and the service staff served with a good attitude But this is where the good stuff stops....While the food tastes reasonably authentic, unfortunately virtually every dish has been pre-cooked too early which makes the quality very ordinary and disappointing. We need to get a few dishes reheated (most likely in a microwave) as they came served cold

Suggested by a Singaporean family friend, we enjoyed sharing four dishes at this highly-rated restaurant, part of the Keppel Club. My pan-fried squid (Sambal Sotong) was nicely-presented and spicy enough for my taste. My wife and I were truly delighted to discover that the Sambal Kangkong , water spinach, is most likely the identical green vegetable to our favourite Vietnamese dish, Morning Glory. Served in Sambal sauce, it was delicious. Another specialty, Ikan Chuan Chuan (fish with ginger sauce) was new to us... and enjoyed by everyone. Beef Rendang was the fourth of five dishes we ordered. We'd have loved to have tried the fifth(!) With none of the wines listed known to us, we decided a punt (at rather high prices) wasn't wise... and settled for Tiger beer. Conclusions and recommendations? Service was friendly, food prices reasonable, and meals spicy and tasty. Our beers were reasonably priced, too. Those who prefer wine may be a little disappointed that no Australian, French or US wines are available

The Peramakan is the restaurant of the Keppel Golf Club, where also non-members are welcome. It offers an excellent choice of Peranakan food (Peranakan = indigenous mixture of Malay with early Chinese travelers to Singapore, with its own culture and cuisine). Even some of our Singaporean friends had Peranakan food for the first time. The dishes are all very tasty, the service fast and efficient, the ambience of the restaurant, though, a little dull
4
A nice place to go for a local lunch or dinner for any ocassion. Their menu has something for everyone. However preference for dishes depends much on individual taste and tolerance for spicyness.
Their desserts are outstanding!
5
We were in PeraMakan ini Keppel Golf Club on Vaters Day. It was fully booked,  but we got a table for an hour.We ordered Chicken Keluak (very tasty! ), Pork Pongtay (was ok), fish soup with meatballs (very nice), squid bbq (great, my fav) and eggplant with shrimp (very nice).In total we paid about $120. The staff was very attentive and polite. It was a great experience and I would recommend this restaurant if you want to eat peranakan food

We're fans of Nyonya food, the Straits Chinese fusion of Indian, Malay and Chinese cuisine this restaurant got good reviews so I booked ahead from Hong Kong for this restaurant. It's quite a way from downtown Singapore, out past Sentosa, located on the third floor of a golf club. It's quite brightly lit, and not terribly atmospheric. The signature Byonya dish, ayam buak keluak, chicken cooked with the ground black nut that don't seem to crop up in any other cuisine was excellent, with additional whole split nuts srved with little plastic spoons so we could winkle every last delicious drop from the shells. Our next choice, ikan chuan chuan, was more mediocre. Fish fillets were fried and served with shredded ginger. It was the fish that was disappointing being a bit overdone. Strange seeing as the place wasn't all that busy despite it being Saturday night. We thought the three of us could manage two side orders of vegetables and so it we could. Sambal kangkong was the best we'd every tasted. Kangkong, or kangkung, is Chinese water spinach and is only seasonally available where we live in Hong Kong, so we always eat as much as possible when we can get it. It was stir-fried and richly flavoured with blachan shrimp paste and chillies for a taste sensation. Our other side was green beans with tomatoes and prawns or kachang panjang. Not bad. Service was attentive and friendly. We got the club to call a cab to take us back to our hotels and one arrived quite promptly, so no problem getting there and back, but it is quite a way to go for a variable quality meal. I think next time we'll eat in town

What are the flavours of Singapore? This must be it. Spicy, zesty with touches of Chinese, Malay and Indian all in the spread we feasted on that night during a company event. From fragrant, hot rice, homemade sauces all in different shades of red, dark red to black and my taste buds will forever remember the absolutely delicious belachan chilli (which I could lick off the plate or eat that with plain piping hot rice). There is a PeraMakan in the East of Singapore, Katong should you wish to try something closer to your neighbourhood. You might wish to wash down those spices with some plain yogurt to neutralise your stomach. Have you had a taste of Singapore yet?

Read the reviews of the restaurant and it is not often that I agree with all the recent reviewers about their dining experience, even the occasional misstep in service.Ordered the set menu for 8 and for each item, there was a choice of between two items in the same category. Nice touch.....Special call outs are as follows:- Ayam Buah Keluak - You have to try to understand why this is on the must have list- Beef Rendang - Super tender beef in a rich but not overly spicy sauce- Ikan Garam Assam - Nice chunks of fish in a tamarind gravy. Not too spicy not too sour- Udang Goreng Assam - Even my daughter who is not a great prawn lover had multiple helpings- Sambal Kangkong - Never knew that this humble vegetable can taste so good.And for dessert, there are multiple options, in order of my personal preference:- Durian Pengat - To die for........- Durian Chendol - The perfect combination of gula melaka, coconut milk and durian.Definitely a restaurant which is on my "must go back again" lis

We had been wanting to visit this restaurant for a long time and finally made it on our anniversary. Glad we chose this restaurant. It was definitely one of the best meals I have had. The ngoh hiang is made to perfection. We also had assam prawns, oxtail stew, grilled fish in ginger sauce and ayam rending. Apart from the chicken dish, which was just good, the rest was excellent. The lemon grass jelly was very good, but the star of the show was definitely the durian chendol. It is absolutely heaven on platter. We will be returning here for many more meals. We loved the Peranakan decor and service was friendly, without being intrusive. Prices are quite reasonable. If I have any grouse, it is just the out of the way location
5
The restaurant is situated on the 3rd floor of a golf club away from the main part of the city. I understand that they have another restaurant on the East Coast Road. We had one of the best meals of our Singapore trip at this restaurant. The food was delicious. We had booked before leaving home and it was probably just as well as the restaurant appeared to be full, mainly with families. However, they had enough staff to cope and the service was great. My wife thoroughly enjoyed their Ayam Kleo and said it was one of the tastiest chicken curries that she has ever had. I had squid in tamarind sauce and we shared Fried Kailan and some of the finest fried rice dishes I have ever had (Peranakan Fried Rice). We will definitely return to this restaurant next time we are in Singapore, probably more than once

I always think that people who live in the East is very lucky because Joo Chiat/Tanjong Katong area is an enclave of good food, wanton mee, nasi padang, prawn noodle….etc. And now, this Peranakan deli shop adds to the list. The first thing that caught my eyes are the buns ($1.50 or 6 for $8) that looked like HK-style Bo Luo Bun. Perhaps due to the dominant flavours of Nyonya fillings, the sugary crust did not stand out like those from Crystal Jade. For full post feel free to visit my blogThe Sambal Petai Savoury Bun is the best out of the three. I thought it would be loaded with the petai vegetable bean but I found more prawns instead, which were considered huge for bread. I love the fiery spicy kick, which nearly knocked me off from my TV couch (was enjoying this in front of TV).Their pies ($1.90 or 6 for $10) look petite but is heavy on fillings. The Ayam Kleo Meat Pie and Babi Pontay Meat Pie won the Seafood Otah Roll ($2.20, picture below) , which did not have a fully flaky crust despite reheating. TheAyam Kleo (nyonya curry chicken with potatoes) sounds like a typical curry puff, but is much balanced and interesting in flavours due to the sweet shortcrust pastry......Pandan desserts are my favourite but both Pandan Portugese Egg Tart ($1.50) and Pandan Swiss Roll with Kaya could be revised with more pandan. Pandan swiss roll had slightly dry texture that day. Durian cream puffwas marginal, not too different from those elsewhere. ......for full post feel free to visit my blo

Casual homely environment with no-fuss efficient service. Must try the sambal belachan, rending, fish otah, ayam masak buah keluak, ngo hiang, chap chye, sambal terong. If you're brave enough, try the hati too - Liver wrapped in omentum.The lime aloe vera drink is refreshing and helps cool you down after all the spicy food.Do leave space for the super desserts - kaya or durian apom balek, bubur chacha,chendol and bubur hitam.
4
This is not my first visit. Have been there a few times when we entertained guests from overseas. The food is good. This time we had the Babi Pongtay- meat was tender and tasty, Beef Rendang- beef practically melts in your mouth, Sambal Sotong - tasty but could do with more gravy, Ayam Sio - just nice. We also had egg omelet with chicalok- small portion, nothing special. We had Egg plant - one portion of egg plant was paired with a prawn, French beans - normal, Bitter gourd- cooked to the right crunchiness. We also had the current special, deep friend chicken with a local spice and some other dishes which were also good.For desserts we had the Apom Berkuah- this is a typical Peranakan dish, should try this if you are there for the first time. We also had Durian Pengat and Durian Chendol, only for those who like Durian. Between the Pengat and Chendol, I think the Pengat is better with durian. Good place to bring overseas guest. The portion is rather small so you will need to order a fair amount of dishes. If the stir fried vege dishes came with prawns, it would seem to be a Prawn dish rather than a vege dish- not the place to get your daily vege requirement! Has a home cooked taste, would go there again
5
We went there with some colleagues who ordered different dishes and they were all excellent! The staff was friendly and attentive. I can definitely recommend this restaurant.
5
Ultra Friendly service, big open clean and attractive restaurant. And great local food with good advise and recommendations from waiting staff.
4
Had an enjoyable family lunch at Peramakan. The Ayam Buakuak was dellicous, Assam Fish Head was tasty and fish was fresh. KId's liked the Beef Rendang. We all liked the Sambal kang kong. Great place to have a family meal.
5
It was our wedding anniversary & we wanted to have nonya food. We ordered different dishes and they are all good! Service was great too with all the staffs very friendly, attentive and helpful! The place was nice too. We would definitely go back again.

WHen Chinese traders first came to Southeast Asia as traders couple of centuries ago, some settled and married local Malay women. Their children, the culture and cuisine are called Peranakan. The Malay word for food is makan - so Peramakan is a fusion word.The simplest taste may be soy braised pork called Babi Pongtay. But you should go for ayam buah keluak - soy based chicken stew- candlenut is a local "spice" so it really adds a twist to the food. Southeast Asia surrounds the Straits of Malacca- so seafood is abundant. simple is chilli paste sauteed fish ikan sambal. If you like a,light tangy broth, ask for sambal assam which can be the base for fish, calamari or prawns. For veggies, plain is chap chye, mixed veggies in hokkien - a Chinese dialect. standard is sambal kangkong - chil paste greens. And for the adventurous try petai - the local version of lima beans fried with small prawns.For beef or mutton- the dry friend Rendang is staple for Malay to Minangkabau nasi padang cuisine.Always leave room for dessert. If the whole meal has been a struggle, then you owe it to yourself to end with apom berkuah - banana caramel sauce over steamed fluffy rice-cakes.Never disappoints.But coconut milk is the basic taste for desserts.If you like yam and sweet potatoes, bobo chacha is worth a try. Or else, chendol with jelly strips we call green worms. If you like rich brown coconut sugar, gula malaka is a sago pudding that often pleases.But if you want to continue your adventure- the fabled fruit durian is served in 2 ways, as a topping for chendol and concentrated in a mousse called Durian Pengat.For the fainthearted, usual assortment of tri-flavor ice cream (van, choc and straw) or ice shaving called ice kachang will quench any fire in your mouth.So fusion - its nothing new but these time tested dishes from at least 18th century must still be around for a reason- they taste good
4
Local friends took us to Peramakan a few years ago, and we try to visit each time we're in Singapore.Great value food, wonderful peranakan dishes and lots of choice for the whole family.Beef rendang is a winner.Even the desserts are a hit, we love the gula melaka and the sticky black rice.Keppel Club is a bit out of the way, but well worth the trek.Atmosphere is family friendly and service is efficient
4
Been to Peramakan twice in the last week as we were that impressed by it. First went there with a colleague from work and we had some overseas visitors this week and thought it would be a good place for them to try some Peranakan Food. You can have the usual selection of Nonya fare and the portions are generous enough. The Ngo Hiang we had was freshly made and delicious and they even allow you to order additional pieces of Buah Keluak at a reasonable $1.50 ea
5
I can say this as I am Peranakan and come from a long line of Nonyas who would rather cook and eat at home (and do the dishes, and there'd be a lot to do!) than go to a semi-ok Peranakan restaurant. The food here (hope my mum doesn't read this) is as good as my mum's cooking. The Ayam Buah Keluak is authentic, hearty and no-nonsense; meaning, it is true to the original recipe. Other restaurants will "bluff" you by adding meat or fillers in the black nut, but these guys give you the real thing and it is mouth-tantalizingly delicious. Other must-orders are the young jackfruit curry and fried aubergines topped with sambal and prawns. Oh leave room for dessert, the durian chendol is pretty amazing. I've only been here twice but will definitely go back to try more dishes! And bring my mom along ... :
5
A very happy surprise. The food is lovely! Clearly good quality and in good portions. The chicken dishes, we had three, were tender, succulent and very tasty. Had a prawn dish too - very good. Notably good sauces and delicious local flavours. Durian desserts are fantastic and homemade. Service was friendly, efficient, welcoming and helpful - just right. Maybe the lighting was set to show how bright, clean and efficient the place was, but the tables had tablecloths and there were some nice window tables. This is not a show-off place - but if you value authenticity, quality of ingredients, cleanliness, tastiness and value, I'd be interested to find anything better. Prices were very reasonable indeed. Overall, excellent local food, good service and superb value

This place serves excellent food, but in not so extravagant atmosphere. All their dishes are authentic and plentiful. Loved their ayam bua keyluk. The place is a little difficult to find though, so do check google maps before you come. The price is reasonable. Best for meals with family, or not so fancy occasion with friends
