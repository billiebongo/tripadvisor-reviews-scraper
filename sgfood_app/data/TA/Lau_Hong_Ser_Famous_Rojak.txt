Love the rojak here. The owner does every plate of rojak with much attention and passion. He also serves his customers with a smile. Be prepared to wait as most people who visit this hawker center will order Lau Hong rojak as side dish.

Eccentric hawker, long queue but oh, worth the wait.. One of the better ones in this area. I believe there is a number that one can call and order in advance ..I just never got down to asking for it. :)

very cheap and good rojak. Only setback is you have to wait at least 30 minutes for it. Stall owner is also pretty friendly.

When we first came to the hotel our tour guide told us about this famous rojak..That's why we will not leave singapore without trying the food they told us the best...It's great to know that there's a lot of restaurant in Bugis market who served this kind of foodIt taste good not familiar with my taste bud. Only I know that it's yummy.
