Overall is good. Brought my bf there to try out. He's a bit disappointed that we can't bbq it ourselves haha but the food is good. Wish the portion is a bit bigger though hehe. Will come back again :)

I enjoy the hassle-free experience of dining at BBQ Box; all the delicious grilled meats pair really well with light beers that often have special promotions. Highly recommended comfort food.

Not sure whether the place just got renovated only or is there a change in ownership. The receipt now reads as BBQ Station. We ordered all the usual stuff of bread, meat and noodles and somehow did not enjoy it as much as previous trips.

Some of it we'll bring. Some of it we won't. There will be other stuff you didn't order. There WILL be cumin. Or as we call it cummins.

Decent place for spicy grilled fish hotpot..we ordered their signature soup base. Bought the voucher from Fave however the fish given was only 800g instead of 1.2kg as stated. The overall taste was good however the fish wasn't fresh hence its slightly fishy in taste. Service was good. Place was very clean!!! Will visit this restaurant again for their skewers.

Delicious food albeit the meat skewers (beef/chicken/pork) portions were a bit small. The chicken wings was excellent. The plate in the middle of the table is just for heating up. Reasonable price.The only disappointing side of this restaurant was I really wish i could bbq the food myself would be more fun. The marianades are really good already on the meats.Secondly photos of the food items on the menu would also make it a plus

BBQ box is a must try! Been here quite a few times now and never have had a problem. The flavour and spices are delicious! However, eating different skewers with having the same flavour all the time will eventually catch up on you and you will feel fed up with it. Having said that, by the following week, you will start having cravings for it all over again! The Shiitake Mushrooms is a must!! You will not be disappointed

In Sg and tried this place, as it is amongst a street full of food outlets, some of which had long queues. This place didn't. It was busy and had a good atmosphere, but service wasn't fast, and not very attentive. My second beer never arrived. My wife enjoyed her selection of skewers (although I thought the cajun chicken tasted floury and unseasoned), and my 'cool noodles' went unfinished because it was so sweet. I doubt we would go back

1. Location :Geylang Outlet (they have 3 outlets as per website)2. Price :Starts from $1 onwards depending on selection. Some premium stuff are more expensive which we didn't try.3. Food :A small candle is being light up inside a box place with foil which is used to put food. All the items have been spice and cooked before served. It's too salty even after we have asked to reduce it. Otherwise, the taste is quite ok. The peppercorn in the noodles are too overpowering that numb our tongues. 4. Service :Not bad and food was served quite promptly after order

Located just around the corner from where we were staying in Geylang we probably wouldn't have tried BBQ Box however it was late and I had a thirst for a beer. At first I thought it was unlicensed but they whisked us away through the kitchen into a room next door, which had seperate bar. The food was really good - Chinese BBQ, it's kinda like like Japanese Yakitori, but cheaper and bigger portions. Each stick is about S$1-2, and it's simply like having a salty spicey buffet on a metal skewer. Downing them with a cold Tsingtao beer is heaven. With over 50 items on the menu we based our choices on the recommendations of the elderly Chinese waitress and the boisterous businessmen on the table next to us you. Given that you have to try the grilled romaine lettuce, grilled asparagus, grilled pork belly and cajun chicken wings - the smoky aftertaste is amazing

Not bad for local to eat this type of food taste.
Different styles then others bbq area. Foods been serving are cook then reheat @ bbq box.
Crowd during weekends and most of it are from China.
Best food for recommendation are their prawns.
4
Their BBQ meats are cheap and delicious..properly marinated and cooked nicely, it's goes along well with cold beers they served. Service was good by friendly uncles and aunties...sure will come back again!.

Th cuisine is northern Chinese. Doesn't look much from out and its not a fancy place. The food is good. Pricing is mid range. Got good chilled beer.

BBQ Box is a restaurant which is known for Chuanr 串儿 (Chinese style barbecued skewers) . Recently it has expanded its Bugis outlet, which is now located right inside of the Bugis MRT station. The restaurant also have 2 other outlets in Singapore, one in Geylang and another in Chinatown. There is free WIFI with password provided on tissue box on the table. Mini bottles of mouth wash available at the sink to refresh one's mouth after the strong flavoured meal. The toilet was quite hippie looking with lock on. There are bins provided by the table side for one to throw the shells.For starters, we hadDry Soya Bean Cake Floss 红油干豆腐丝 (S$6.80++)It was shredded bean curd skin, marinated in a spicy chilli oil mixture.Refreshing and peak up the appetizing.and Grilled Oyster 碳烤生蚝 (S$18.80).The fat juicy oyster was served topped with a chilli garlic mixture. Yummy.The Chuanr were served over a griller to keep warm.Grilled Pork Sausage 烤猪肉脯香肠 (S$1.60++)Looked dry but tasted not bad.Grilled Shisamo 日本多春鱼 (S$3.20++/ 3pcs)Lots of roe in the fish.Grilled Sweet Corn 烤玉米 (S$1.60++)Juicy and sweet.Grilled Romaine Lettuce 烤油麦菜 (S$1.30++)The vegetables was well char grilled with a smoky taste, but I felt the seasoning a tab too much here, although it tasted alright when washed down with beer.Grilled Pleurotus Eryngii 烤杏鲍菇 (S$1.50++)The mushroom was soft and juicy.Grilled Tentacles of Squid 碳烤鱿鱼须 (S$5.80++)Chewy and smoky.Grilled Fresh Prawn 烤鲜虾 (S$1.60)++)Juicy and fresh.Chicken Mid-Wings 吊炉鸡中翅 (S$2.20++)Juicy and meaty.Grilled Beef (leg meat) 牛肉串 (S$1.00++)Juicy and meaty.Grilled Mutton (leg meat) 羊肉串 (S$1.00++)I felt that the mutton was quite tough to chew.Cajun Roasted Chicken Mid-Wings 奥尔良鸡中翅 (S$2.20++)The version of mid-wings was much more flavourful with a more spicy taste, compared to the normal flavour.Grilled Bread 烤面包片 (S$1.00++)We like it so much that we ordered another round.Served hot, it was nicely browned and crisp, with a buttery taste, sprinkled with sugar and spices. Addictive and kind of reminding us of an old school taste.There were various condiments on the table to add extra flavours to the food : vinegar, soy sauce, chilli sauce and raw garlic ( to thin the blood after having the high cholesterol barbecued food).Don't forget to order icy cold beer to go with the food. We had Lao Te Beer 青岛嶗特啤酒 (S$5/ 600ml) from Qing Dao 青岛, China , which was recommended by the staff. It was light and refreshing.The star dish was Special Seafood Combo 海鲜大咖 (S$88.80++/ small).I was surprised that there was so many ingredients in the seafood combo, ranging from abalone, scallop, crawfish 小龙虾, prawn, squid, lotus root, quail egg, black fungus, potato, to bean curd skin 豆腐皮. I felt that the spicy broth in the dish was toned down to suit the local taste bud.After finishing the seafood in this dish, we had the remaining broth topped up with more broth and some handmade noodles. It was delicious having the noodles with just the broth in it.Overall the food was yummy. Served in little sticks, I found that one can really eat alot

BBQ Box (Chuan Shao Gong Fang) is a Northen Chinese cuisine restaurant, specialising in barbecue / grilled skewers. Their first outlet was established in 2007 in the Geylang area, followed quickly by their second outlet in the Bugis area, which opened in 2008. With a strategy to cater to the masses, BBQ Box (Chuan Shao Gong Fang) commonly draws in crowds even on weekdays, and is fully packed on weekends. Their success has led them to open a third outet in the Chinatown area in 2015.Ambience at BBQ Box (Chuan Shao Gong Fang) is part of their appeal. Unlike other places, the staff actually help you barbecue / grill the skewers in the kitchen, and serve it to you ready-to-eat. This means that the place smells clean and fresh, you don't walk away with food odors on your clothing. The spacious, brightly lit area is also kept clean and neat, and the modern furniture is relatively comfortable. Tables are nicely sized, with a warmer in the centre to keep the skewers hot, which I felt is a good idea.Service at BBQ Box (Chuan Shao Gong Fang) is decent, of passable standards. Each table is equipped with a call button, and staff usually show up quickly. They converse mostly in Chinese Mandarin, but are competent in English as well. Orders usually take about 10 minutes or so to fulfill, rather quick despite the crowd. I note that staff are also efficient are clearing away empty / dirty tables when guests leave, though you'll usually have to call them if you want to change your plates mid-way through your meal. Expect a queue of about 20 minutes during peak dining periods, advance reservations are recommended.Food at BBQ Box (Chuan Shao Gong Fang) is focused on North Chinese cuisine, particularly read-to-eat skewers barbecued / grilled to order. To cater to the masses, the recipes use a lot less salt and chili, making it palatable for most people. For the China Chinese, they can still order the 'traditional' taste, which is intensely salty and super spicy. Generally, I find the toned down version (using less salt and chili) to be tasty enough with a slight hit of spices, and at least I don't walk away feeling thirsty or uncomfortable. Flavours are bold, largely due to a house made spice marinade on the food. Communal dining is highly encouraged. Prices are comparable to other restaurants in the area, budget about SGD $35 per person for a full meal here

Haven't seen this much around Singapore. Skewered meat and vegetables aplenty, seasoned with cumin and other spices unique to China. You can think of it as satay but expect the flavours to be very different from the local Singaporean satay. Comfortable seating, good for medium-sized groups to family with children. Noise level is high because the noise is trapped indoors and Chinese people love to speak loudly. Expect lots of mainland Chinese people. Sunday dinner is worst time to come. Lunch is best time due to lack of crowd

Finally I got chance to try BBQ Box branch at Geylang. Thanks to my girlfriend's boyfriend. Took a free ride there. It can accessible via by MRT station, Kallang and 8 to 10 mins from there. We had simple supper as we already had dinner from other place. Their marination and the way of their BBQ skill were better than Tan Quee Lan. As usual, I loved their mantou, Romania vegetable (must try). You can request less oil for BBQ. We had the chicken and pork skewers, I can smell their herbs like thymes etcI will visit there again. Hope they will remain the same and good standard

My girlfriend went to BBQ box in Geylang and Tan Quee Lan branches very often and she knew the menu very well. She always posted into Facebook to share with friends. It was my first time to Tan Quee Lan branch. Good stuff must always share in the trip advisor. We ordered the pork and chicken sticks, grilled fish and mantou, I had 2 of that. We also ordered few rounds of Romania vegetable too. Staff were very courteous. They were made their rounds to clear our table and also to check any additional orders if needed

There is always a long queue here and one late night there was none so we gave it a try. My jaw dropped down when I saw the menu prices. So cheap ....and when they served the food OMG. Very nice ! The only down side is they use the same marinade for all. But food was good

“Guys I really suggest BBQ Station if you can take some heat”, said Ken, our local friend in Singaapore. I smirked. How could anyone suggest barbecue to a Dubai resident? What do they think our winter (whatever that is) comprises of anyway? We buy dozens of absurdly warm but-hey-its-fashion woolen wears for our 15 days of winter. We roam around scores of “winter markets” which basically sell the same things. But above all, we barbecue away, man. We are the kings of the play. The champs of the game. Don’t talk barbecue to us! I couldn’t have been more of a moron. Barbecue Station turned out to bear a different take on the concept of barbecue. For one, it might look as if the spice rub on different meats are more or less the same – but of course, they are not. Second, it might seem as if some of the dishes have more of a fried texture than barbecued – which could go either ways, I’m quite unsure. It proudly showcases the fatty layer, it sometimes leave that slight oil tinge. But the essence of the matter is – it is deliciousness no matter how you look at it.It was around 3.30pm when we stepped in, so the restaurant was empty with the battle scars of the past lunch time remaining here and there. The staff squat around couple of the tables working on assembling meat on skewers and handling the home-made noodles – preparations for the dinner time. We took our seats and skimmed through the menu, ticked the items we fancied and sat back. The menu gave us the option of ordering the item per piece or skewer so that we could try more dishes without the hazard of a precariously bulging tummy. Our order consisted of one skewer of chicken mid-wing, one big lamb rib, one fresh sleeve- fish, one grilled fresh prawn, grilled oyster mushroom and two mutton BBQ leg meat. The guest with us wanted to try out more daring options like the grilled pig trotter and pig ear with cucumber. We waited with unabashed impatience and a well-built appetite. The skewers arrived first and everything else followed within a span of 2 quick minutes. The spice rub was worth killing for – fennel and chilly flakes seemed to be the stars of the rub. The prawns squirted out juiciness when bit into, instantly prompting me to order two more of them. The mutton bbq leg meat and the chicken mid-wings were perfectly grilled and well marinated, so was the sleeve fish, though one skewer was too less to appreciate it fully. Being a sucker for mushrooms, I quite liked the grilled oyster mushrooms too. All said and done, the Skewer of the Year award belonged to the fabulous grilled fresh prawn. The big lamb rib was a shocker. It was glorious in looks. The marinade glimmered on the dry skin. And the fat…oh the fat! The fat proudly paraded itself just under the skin, but visible enough to be seen and salivated on. Four very rich and ravishing rack of lamb that came with a dry dip of spices. Tasting much like a chaat masala of sorts, the dip did unspeakably amazing things to the already delicious lamb, making it almost sinful to leave any bits untouched or wasted. The pig trotter looked more like a boney version of the lamb rack, so that didn’t interest me much. But the pig ear with cucumber looked fascinating and refreshing with the greens drenched in chilly flakes. Our friend recommended it heartily and the empty plate at the end of his meal proved to be his testimony. So this place BBQ Station, also called BBQ Box in their visiting card and some banners, is not really a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. They have mini branches around Singapore, with the one we visited in South bridge road. The cuisine is Northern Chinese, with an extensive selection of fish, meats and vegetables (cold and hot) to choose from. Everything we had ranged from S$1-3 per skewer, with the big lamb rack being the exceptional $S18 and the pig ear and cucumber being S$10. A locally recommended BBQ spot that is definitely worth a visit during your next visit to Singapore. BBQ Station/ BBQ Box: 262, South Bridge Road, Singapore 058811Tel: 62216629. Open from 12pm – 2am.*Our friend says the restaurant is PACKED during the meal times on regular days, so make sure you are prepared to wait a bit, or make a reservation.
