A good place to visit and eat serving a variety of delicious Chinese and Malay Food.
They serve a mean Rojak Singapore and Satay.
2
Ordered 10sticks of Beef satay, although well seasoned they were really tough n chewy,not too sure whether it had to do with the cut of beef that they were using.
3
Good place to hang out after a walk at Botanc Gardens. Not much variety, but the cheapest option around.
5
We're here before 7.30AM and only a few stalls were open. The other popular ones were still preparing. Had a bad Nasi Lemak, not so good banana ball, and the best tea halia.
5
Such amazing carrot cake! A must eat! Haven't found any better/ including Newton! Crowds can be heavy at peak hours.
3
An old but busy food centre in suburban Bukit Timah. My guest had the prawn noodle dry which was excellent but forgot to asked for it without ketchup. I had the famous selera rasa nasi lemak which was average, not as good.
4
Great place to grab lunch on a budget if you dont mind the afternoon heat/crowd. The nasi lemak and prawn noodles are really good.
5
This is an authentic Hawker's stand, which has the added benefit of being covered, with comfortable seating and clean facilities. There is an outstanding range of Singaporean and Malaysian food available, along with cold and hot beverages. No. 1 Adam's Nasi Lemak is the clear favorite here, which ranks in the top spots in Singapore to try this classic dish. It's nothing fancy but for an inexpensive and delicious experience, go to Adam Road
4
Friends took us here, and tasty Nami Lasak and other tasty treats like Milk Tea/Coffees. Get there early as stalls can have long queues. Which are the ones you want to visit. Food is cheap in the US$4-7 per plate. Drinks in the $3-5 range. Cafeteria style where you serve/bus your own tables. Can be hot as no air conditioning. Good luck and enjoy
3
This place has been around for the longest time and the selection stays the same. I would say >70% of the stalls are serving Muslim food. Favourites like mee goreng, satay, mee soto, etc. If you want something more towards Muslim food, this is a good place to enjoy
5
Must eat nasi lemak from no.1 nasi lemak.it is amazing.you have to wait half an hour at long line but this is a sign that the food is delicius.the rice and the fried chicken was the best i have eaten in singapore
2
Lines a mile long in the heat for the "best" Nasi Lemak. Lines held up by old character stopping lines for 100 plate orders. Got the meal in one hour. Bland greasy and a day spoiler. avoid
3
a small hawker place and tad far from Singapore centre. there are bigger nicer ones in the city eg maxwell.
5
... Nasi Lemak, Soto ayam & teh Tarik, in my book. Others come for the mutton soup and prawn noodles. Expect to queue during peak hours.
4
Siti Nur liy ana stall has an amazing Mee soto. The Chilli they make is amazing as well!
Also the fruitopia fruit/juice stall is outstanding
5
One of the popular food centres for all Singaporean due to the variety. Chinese, Indian, Malay, western and others all available.
Personally, i would recommend the Kambing (lamp) soup, mee soto and the nasi lemak. If you are a tourist.. ask around for recommendations.
3
This food centre is one of the best w halal food served... there are 2 nasi lemak stalls, a few indian mee goreng, satay, mee rebus n mee soto,great teh tarik and a few more popular Chinese prawn noodles....
5
We visited Singapore both for the attractions and food and this place doesn't disappoint. We had lunch here after a long walk from the Botanic Gardens and we know there are many selections we can chose from. I had chow hur fun and hubby had curry. I finished my lunch with chendol and hubby had the lime juice. Tasty food and very good valu
4
Not every food in here good but there are many stalls that sells good food.Not every stalls halal but you can check it which one. Mostly the not halal one is the chinese cuisine.Oh, there are some Indian stalls that come to you to offer their food. If you're still unsure about what you want to eat, please don't hesitate to reject the

1. Last weekend having dinner at Adam Hawkers Centre. First time after their renovation.2. Everything look new, food stall still the same.3. It was crowded. After waiting for a 15min manage to get a seat.4. Price are reasonable with abandon of local Singapore dish. The famous Nasi Lemak steal always Long queue with customer waiting in line.5. People there mix & all over Singapore & I could see a lot of visitors from overseas.6. If you drive, be prepared to wait for some time to get park your vehicle. Parking lot limited
5
Best Soto Ayam in Singapore from Warong Pak Sapari, best Teh Helia Terik from Adam Drink Store and not forgetting Selera Nasi Lemak but be prepared to queue for them. Other Chinese food are popular too, like Adam Road big prawn noodles.
4
it's a long Q for SELERA nasi lemak. But worth it. But in ther meantime, bring your phone or talk to your neighbours.
5
All time favourite Mutton Soup from Barakath Stall, very decilious and the meats are soft to be eaten.
Must Try for Those Who Have Not Been There.
5
At Adams road there appears to be something for everyone . The Hawker centre has a great vibe and is a nice size so isn't too overwhelming to navigate like some others. All the dishes look amazing but go for the ones with long lines. The Nasi Lemak, Noo Chen big prawn noodles and Rojak cannot be missed . Must visit for local cuisine!
4
We came here on a Sunday evening and got a mountain of lamb/beef/chicken satay, prawn soups, an Indian-ish rice dish whose name I've now forgotten, of course some nasi lemak, and rounds of fruity or tea or coconut drinks. My bodyguard recommends sitting at the table and seeing where the line forms, then wait for that line to go down (I was skeptical, but he was right). Remember to bring your own napkins! And you can always wash off at the sink in the middle of the round.MRT stop: Botanical Gardens
5
This is an amazing place just outside the botanical garden. We arrive shortly after 8 and it was already busy. The layout is circular and each stand is quite small. However, the cooks are able to produce culinary delights from their small places which are in many cases far better than what is served in larger restaurants. My favorite stand was #2 where we had a Royal roast consisting of a portion of all they had on offer
5
Not hard to find and only 5mins from the MRT, this is a proper locals location, with snoozing taxi drivers and locals on a mission to collect lunch for their workmates. The Nasi lemak, gado gado and mee soto were winners for us and we went daily for breakfast.You should eat here, its low pressure for tourists and clean as its just been renovated
4
It's quite convenient, just across the road is Botanical Gardens MRT. The Stall 2 Selera Nasi Lemak is spectacular. Do try it. Then there is a stall that only sells sugarcane juice. Really good. For those who loves prawn mee, this food centre sells one of the best prawn mee around! The prawns are giganomous! You can see the fresh prawns in front of the stall.Good place to go for local fare. Is air-ier at night, so if you are afraid of heat, just go at night
4
The design is good and does not feel cramp or hot. I tried the famous Selera nasi lemak which is requested by the Sultan of Brunei each time he visits Singapore. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong served it to Indonesian President Joko Widodo. The rice is very good, but I think that the sides like chicken wings are just average. Forget about ordering the fish. Note that the stall is closed on Fridays, and is opened from 7 am to 5 pm.I also like the mee rebus at selamat datang and the mutton soup at Bahrakath Mutton Soup King.Note that the food center will be closed for refurbishment from 5 Sep to 16 Oct 2016. Check NEA website for more information
4
You only get satay after 5pm or 7pm in Singapore and Adam is one of the few that you can find satay during the day.Only thing is you need to order at least 10 sticks. You have the choice of beef, mutton or chicken. $0.70 each stick & self service. Also tried the chicken Briyani. Yummy with a whole chicken drumstick.There are fans around but being Singapore, the place is still humid. Do come in comfortable light clothing to enjoy the good local fare. There are many other local food like nasi lemak, chay tau kway (white or black), char kway Teow, oyster omelet, prawn noodles that I would love to try (unfortunately I had no more capacity).Great place to try local food at affordable prices.Note: this place will be closed from 5 Sep- 16 October for some repair/restoration work.
4
If you're craving good Malay food, this food centre has the best! I come here for Selamat Datang's Mee Soto, Selera Rasa's Nasi Lemak and Taj Mahal's Teh Halia! For $10 or less you can get some of the best eats here
5
I don't understand why the rating isn't higher. There's a lot of great food here. Try the Prawn Noodle Soup, which is quite famous here. Or the very famous Nasi Lemak. Or my favourite Bihun Goreng Putih. Or the Sup Kambing. Or the Fried Hokkien Mee. And they're all at very affordable prices. Then again, perhaps it's good that it's not ranked too high, parking is already scarce and we don't want too many people flocking there to try the food.

Went to eat at number 2 Adam Road food court nasi lemak. Small portions. The rice was OK but the rest were a paltry few items, and no peanuts with the ikan bilis. The fish was also excessively dry.The two stalls there are supposed to be famous for their quality and level of tastebud satisfaction, but it just felt like an average overpriced breakfast.A friend told me the kitchen has been centralised and all that the stalls receive is food to reheat. I hope this isn't true - if it is it's another sad nail in the coffin of Singapore food delights. Already my experience of char kuay teow in two separate locations were dreadful, one being at the food court at Changi T3 which used to be not bad.Come on Singapore - food is one of the few good assets you have still have. Hungrygowhere? Thailand.....
4
This is the place to come late in the night when you are hungry or early in the morning after exercising at the nearby Botonical Garden. Lots of good and cheap local food here. The Nasi Lemak here is famous but you usually have to queue for some time. The Prawn Noodles and other local favorites are equally good here
5
We took a taxi here, from our hotel one morning, as word-of-mouth makes this food stall a "must do", in Singapore. My wife stood in a 30 minute queue to buy their legendary dim sum or nasi goreng, or whatever it is that she likes... But I walked around looking, until I found my fix. I spotted an Indian dude with a stainless steel trey, carrying what appeared to be a piece of rothi or naan, with a bit of hot lava poured over it. to this day, I know not what it was, but I jumped into the fast-moving line of the vendor and requested that the worker serve me up the same dish that the Indian dude had. I inhaled it both violently and speedily. I returned, and said "thank you more please"... This time I ordered a double! Again, I ate it like it owed me money! The flavors are impossible to describe, so I wont even insult them by trying. Just know, that if a doctor ever tells me that I've got 24 hours to live, I'll make every effort to get back to Adam Road Food Centre, and enjoy one last serving of that mysterious magma that I loved so well
5
Visited on a Friday, 1130am. Stall #2 nasi lemak was not open. Long queue for stall #1 nasi lemak. Queued about 40 minutes for the nasi lemak. Good. Not very oily. Cannot order extra chicken wing though. Also had Teh Tarik and Coffee Tarik from stall #12.It is one of the smaller hawker centres in Singapore. Counted less than 100 tables, each sit 2 or 4 pax. Well ventilated. They installed three fans on every pillar. Clean spacious toilets
5
If you do visit or are in the Neighbourhood remember to drop by Adams' food centre for some old school treats... I'm having the Mee Hoon Soto today and it's delicious. Spicy, thick and sweet is what you'll get in a bowl of hot Soto soup.
5
we were lucky enough to be taken here by an ex-pat resident of Singapore and it was well worth it. I can't comment on access to the venue via public transport as we went by car, but the car park is small and there is a fee involved.We had the Nasi-Lemak and Ginger tea - it was awesome. Proper old style hawker food from tiny stalls in a local environment. Dont expect anything fancy - plastic seats, plastic trays and drinks in cups, but the food was amazing and cheap ++. The breakfast Nasi-Lemak was $3.50 and the large Ginger tea $3.00 - you don't get cheaper than that.We felt lucky to have sen one of the genuine local favourites and would recommend to any one who can get there
5
Carpark might be not too many, but with the price and quality of food.. Its worthwhile!Public transport is not too convinient, best to go by cab straight in.. The picture uploaded was maggie goreng combo (fried maggie combo), and indian rojak.. The maggie goreng combo, consist of maggie goreng itself, mutton chop and the awesome cheese fries of about $12. If you wanna get individual, it would cost more than $15, so why spend so much when you can the best 3 in 1 dish of only $12. The indian rojak, cant recall the item but it has around 6-8 items and it cost $12 only. With the yummy sauce, please.. With the limited carpark but just 2 awesome food (and many more for you to explore yourself..) it is worth your time to pay a visit.. Satify your craving and not burnt a hole. Anyone
3
Just to enter into the car park was a nightmare. Once passed the gentry, it became hellish because Singapore motorists are kiasu, inconsiderate & blatantly rude. I sympathised & empathised some elderly folks who drove their cars into their long awaiting lot but got snatched up by young road bullies who rammed their cars & couldnt give a hood to these poor folks. The lots are so narrow that one cant even open the car door wide enough for a decent body to come out or enter. The premise is so hot like a sauna & tables are arranged so closely making it a hassle to walk through. It's a circular shaped structure & queues can overlap into other stalls. Very delighted to see many Malay Stalls in a hawker center because I love Malay cuisines very much & in many centers in Singapore, there's always a far cry of shortage of Malay Stalls. I reckon the government should make it mandatory to increase Malay Stalls in hawker centers. There are also quite a fair bit of Mamak Stalls in sight. I think any stall here is a good stall or else they would have died & closed down due to the strong market force & stiff competition. If i were to rank the food quality, taste & pricings, i would rank this place 5 stars. The carpark & the ambience pulled the ranking down. If you love good food, please by all means die die must try here
4
Good place to get nasi lemak. Apparently both stalls #1 and #2 are aomg the best nasi lemak in Singapore
5
I think the best prawn noodles is in this food centre. The broth is good and it's value for money.
The Cheng Tng dessert stall serves very tasty and generous warm Cheng Tng. Don't miss it too.
5
central, near the botanic gardens yet great local food, not touristy. The soup kambing (mutton soup) is great.
3
Recommend to go by a local as Newton Hawkers was closed for a few months.got there about 8pm but about 1/2 stalls were closed - so not many choices. food we got was nice but wouldn't say it was amazing or anything I would recommend
3
Enjoyed the choice of food. It all seemed to be fresh and well prepared. For cheap eats in Singapore you really cannot beat places like this, loads of choice so if you go in a larger group there should be something there to suit all taste buds
5
You have to like hawker food to appreciate this place. It need some patience to find the right food to your liking, but personally I love prawn mee.The prawn new stall has an amazing one. The waiting is a bit awkward to understand the queueing system. But once waiting is done I order the dry version (soup on the side).The way the noodles are spiced is delicious and the soup with prawns is very tasty. Be ready to sweat and search, but the food is tasty and cheap
1
I'll admit straight out I'm not a hawker food fan, but this was hawker food at it's worst. My husband and I wandered around for about 30 minutes looking at one greasy oily mess of a pan after the other until we settled on some kebabs and fresh coconut. Nothing much in the way of vegetables and greens and doesn't do justice to what other hawker stalls have to offer
1
I have visited Singapore numerous times but a long time since been here. Now incredibly disappointing. Some unusual dishes at Adam Road but quality of food is too good elsewhere in Singapore and it no longer worth the trek out there. Sad but true. Great food elsewhere in this foodie paradise.
3
This place has a love-hate relationship with me. Sometimes I find this place great and at other times, it's quite mediocre. At other times, it's closed without notice. I like the soup kambing but it's easy overpriced. The prawn noodles used to be good but not so now. The one at Tiong Bahru market is better. And not to mention, it's easy overpriced too. The friendlier teh tarik seller always gets customers because he bothers to walk around and ask people if they want to drink. Not like the others who expect business to come flying to them. The main attraction here is the nasi lemak. There are two, side by side. The last stall is also popular but hers is not the best. The better one are the guys next to her (inner stall). They use basmati rice and their rice is flavorful and fragrant but not only. The food is quite reasonably priced too. Theirs is the best nasi lemak I've tasted so far. When the sultan of Brunei comes over, our pm hosts the royal family with nasi lemak from this stall. That's how good it is
5
Adam is one of the smaller food centres (30 stalls). Whenever we've been there at least 20 stalls were open. Round, neighborhood style structure. Large variety of food. Inexpensive and good. Very convenient location just over a pedestrian bridge from Botanic Gardens MRT. Great for a food stop before or after Botanic Gardens, National Orchid Garden or a concert in the park
4
It's relatively smaller than the one on Newton Road. Choices are nevertheless plenty, drinks, chinese food, skewers, curry, seafood, generally street food. Always a great option when you don't know what to do/ where to go!
3
As a sinkee ,I won't recommend you coming here unless you want to try the nasi lemak(MUST BE SERLRA RASA)and the Prawn Mee.
4
i went there at 11:05 am on a friday morning, i was excited to look at the seemingly short queue, yet it took me 1 hour to get my nasi lemak. by the time i was seated with nasi lemak, it was already 12:10. The portion looked small, and i just hoped that the nasi lemak is not overrated. i took the first bite, and truly, it didn't disappoint. The rice is fluffy, and the sambal was just perfect. If you have more time at hand, and you can chat with your friend while queuing up, it's worth it
3
I was making my way to church on Sunday morning when I walked past this rather ramshackle looking building. However, upon noticing the symbols for 'place your tray here' I suddenly realised that it was a hawker's center. This is one pretty small, and when I came here for lunch it was quite crowded â€“ I had some difficulty finding a table under cover since it did rain for a bit. However they do have quite a good variety of stalls offering all sorts of different food. You can tell which stalls are the really popular ones because there tends to be a long line out the front of them. As I said though, this one is much smaller than some of the other ones, but I do love the atmosphere
4
The place is smaller than other venues I've gone to eat, but the food was great. It wasn't intuitive at all so I really had to be careful about what I ordered.I'm giving it 4 stars because I would have loved to see more options as it is mostly Malaysian and Hindu, despite there being between 15 and 20 stalls
4
Adam road food centre has heaps of good food, you can start with the indian rojak, mee goreng special and finish that hearty meal off with a nice ice kachang. Seats are plenty and the place is clean enough to dine in, it get's a little hot so cool off with a sugarcane drink and dig in!
4
I've always loved coming to Selera Rasa for their nasi lemak. They are fast, efficient & super friendly. There is always a queue of at least 20 mins wait but it is so worth it! The chicken wing meal is my favourite - the chicken is coated is a batter that make sit super crunchy without being oily. The otak (steamed fish in banana leaves) was only ok. The Sambal is to die for.As for drinks - avoid avoid avoid stall #29 Soon Huat Fresh Fruit Drinks. They are dirty & the woman fronting the stall is a mean troll. I chose to order drinks from the sweet girl next door (they have a brighter sign with interesting fruit juice mixes). As a result, the owner of stall 29 chose to sit in front of my table & curse at me in local dialect & glared at me throughout my entire meal to intimidate me. The sweet girl next door said she does it to all her competitors' customers. You can't miss her - she is big & old& fat & nasty looking. Avoid at all costs!
3
The selection of food was mostly Malay so to us the variety of local Chinese wasn't there, however what we had satay, nasi lemak, Chicken rice, etc. was OK but had better. The place was busy and finding a seat proved difficult as there were six of us. There appeared to be only one cleaner and he was slow so many of the vacant tables were dirty. The seating was also very uncomfortable and difficult to get into, probably because two of us were bigger then the local Chinese. We were given paper plates and plastic spoons and forks which we didn't like by our food vendor, however we managed to locate metal spoons and forks from another vendor, but still only paper plates. Obviously the place is very popular with local Chinese as it was so busy and the food must be good, but unfortunately not to our liking
5
It had been over 25 years since I last visited Adam Road Food Centre and it was great to have breakfast here. There are just 32 stalls in this centre, with just a dozen stalls open for the morning trade. The others open later and operate till late supper. Stall 2 Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak came recommended so it was worth the time spent in the long queue - possibly the best nasi lemak I've had. It's true that foreign dignitaries have been hosted here - sometimes simple food is the best!Stall 32 for drinks - their Teh Halia is full of ginger - great! Hope to return to try something else - heard the prawn mee is worth another visit
5
I like it because of the atmosphere - be it morning lunchtime or dinner time there will always be a range of people from all walks to life. Also there is a range of stalls - the most famous one being the rasa selersa nasi lemak store that even the prime minister of singapore recently hosted the Indonesian president. Because there use to be a Malay Kampong nearby, they have good Nasi Briyani (absolutely delicious), kambing etc. Also they have the most friendly noodle hawker at the fish ball noodle place. The duck noodle store is also excellent. Although the prawn noodle store has received a lot of recommendations, I personally find the soup a bit bland.
4
Whenever i or my mom craves for kambing soup....we definitely will.head towards Adam Rd Food Centre. Have never been disappointed. Simply 'slurpicious' 😆
1
As a local, I would personally recommend Clementi Town Food Centre. There you will find the true meaning of 'spoilt for choice'.
3
As a big group we went here for lunch after a business meeting. We quickly found our food and drinks, we were well served and talked a lot amongst us... great variety of food, good quality.
5
This Malay traditional dish is a must when you are in Singapore. A Malay stall 3 stalls away from the satay stall. Not the satay but only this Mala food stall. The satay is not so good so do not try.
5
They serve the best Nasi Lemak here....also the stall next to it sells delicious beef rendang..
A must try if you are in the vicinity
3
Went there for dinner. Has a lot of selections on offer. You just need to choose what you want.
Needed a facelift i believe with the amount of people going there =)
5
Having lived in Singapore for 4 years and since having returned dozens of times through the years... I have experienced more than my fair share of sing food. While I can probably name my top 20 dishes/places - I will limit it to 7. Number 1 is the the nasi lemak in Adam Rd. hawker center. While there are some worthy competitors - Adam's Nasi Lemak is a clear winner - the rice is truly heavenly and the sambal is glorious.... the fried chicken (kampung style) is scrawny but tasty and the other condiments are ok lah. Best thing to do (if you can manage) is to do a take out and top up with home-made fried chicken, and pickled vegies achar. That is the way of the gods. Three pieces of advise - come in early to avoid huge queues (and possibly their running out of rice); come by taxi or bring lucky charm to find parking spot; dont make a mistake and get the nasi from the neighboring stand... must be the Adam's Nasi Lamak one.I write about the other 6 dishes in the heavenly journey in separate reviews- Adam Seafood BBQ- Kay Lee Roast Meat Joint- 328 Katong Laksa- Kovan Market Rojak- River South Prawn Noodles- Hong Lim Complex Char Kwe TiaoBon apetite!
4
Adam Road food centre have existed for decade and gone through numbers of transformation since it was first built. There are number of food stalls with verity of dishes to choose eg Chinese, Indian and Malay. On of the popular is the Nasi Lemak (Rice cooked with coconut milk). Easiest mode there is by Taxi. I' m sure all taxi driver will know when you mention "Adam Road Food or Hawker Centre"
4
I hadn't realized what a difference the texture of the ice shavings made to the overall "flavour" of an ice kachang until I tried the ice kachang at "Teck Kee Hot & Cold Dessert" at Adam Road Food Centre. While most other dessert sellers offer ice shavings of medium texture, "Teck Kee Hot & Cold Dessert" offers the finest, smoothest ice shaving I've ever tried. Top that off with generous helpings of filling & fragrant syrup, and "HEAVEN"
3
This is a smaller hawker center near the north end of the Botanical Gardens. I don't think there is any famous stalls here, though there was one with a super long line all the time. All the stalls I sampled were good and the prices here are better than other centers I have been too.The standout was the Sugar Plant for sugar cane juice. I am going to miss that place after we leave
3
The Adam Road food center is know for its Nasi Lemak and the stalls don't disappoint. Get there early as the food runs out sometimes.
5
love to eat the ice kacang is different from outside. the ice kind of more smooth n the price is cheap.
4
Patronised the food centre for the past 20 years! always enjoyed the fried bee hoon and a nice cool glass of fruit juice (from the zesty stall owner's wife)! Haha. Good taste, great times.
3
it's the only food that i eat in Adam food centre. there is one prawn store in Adam that is very famous. the other food i'm not sure but only go there for the prawn noodle.
4
There are many stalls selling good halal food. Satay, chicken rice, mutton soup, mee goreng, cook-to-order etc.Perhaps the most concentration of halal food fare within a food centre in Singapore.The centre's nasi lemak is a gourmet's magnet. Queues are endless, food appealing, prices worth paying.Other hawker non-halal fares such as chye tow kuay, char kuay teow, fresh fruit juice, on-the-spot bbq seafood, are on offer.A good venue for tourist to rub shoulders with us locals, grab and gobble down Singapore street food at prices that don't trigger heart attacks.Unlike food centres in the heartlands which twins with a wet-market, the environment here is less harsh, less stuffy, more inviting. Very much like Newton Circus food centre.There is a name-sake BBQ stall (bearing the name Adam) within this centre that operates at dinner time. The operators opens for business at about 5pm. The bbq stingray, belachan kangkong and chili squid rings should at least make your day
4
In Singapore , there are many food centre (or hawker centre). Noramlly, the price is cheaper than resturant or coffee shop. From this food centre , you can enjoy many different Singapore food. I like the Nasi Lemak (Malay rice store No. 2) - Fried Checken wing and Ota , Big Prawn noddle , India Mutton soup , BBQ SeaFood (Fried Chilli String ray) , Teck Kee hot and cold dessert and etc. When you see those stores with long queue, usually, the food is good and price is reasonable. Foreigners who can not take spicy food, better not to add Chilli. Alternatively, you can order fruit juice or cold desert in case you want to eat spicy food!Fore tourist, you can come here by Taxi (15 mins from Town) , MRT (Sudway or Train) or bus.You can use google "Adam Food centre - under images", more photographs you can see! If you want Good food and good price ... visit Adam food centre
1
I droppedby this hawker stall just now in the afternoon and I saw a long queue at this particular stall and lined up for food. It took me 45 minutes from the stall to the table. I was hoping for decent nasi lemak, I ordered chicken wing set. The rice has not much santan taste, the fried chicken wings is too stiff to bite and it tasted very bad. I recommend the next to it nasi lemak stall which taste better. The teh tarik by mamak here doesnt seemed like teh tarik and he served me a normal one cost me $1.30. Such a liar
4
Loving the food here.. We have tried various stalls not just the famous ones and have enjoyed most. Very local and everyone we speak that are local singaporeans seems to know of this food centre and they all have their favourites! Fried bee hon is pretty tasty! Prices start at 3$ ...and don't go up much from that. Not far from bukit brown cemetery if you want to make a good morning of culture and 2 stops on the bus to the food centre
4
I frequent this place together with many of my friends for one of the best places to eat Nasi Lemak in Singapore. Nasi Lemak is a malay dish that directly translates into "Rice Fat" and is one of Singapore's iconic dishes such as Chicken Rice, Laksa and Char Kuay Teow (Just to name a few). It is so named because of the cooking method that involves infusing the rice with coconut which is known to be high in fat content. If you're looking for a small, not-too-crowded eating destination that is quintessentially Singaporean, then this is one of a handful that you must visit. It isn't very large, and the ring of stalls that form a courtyard seating area with umbrellas make this eating centre less stuffy, as is the case for many fully-enclosed eating spaces. It is a bit weather-sensitive but a nice setting nevertheless. The Nasi Lemak stall by the name of Selera Rasa can be found second to the end of the corner leading to the proper entrance/exit of the food stall circus. It is situated next to another Nasi Lemak stall that sits in position no. 1 (Hence it's name No.1 Nasi Lemak, and should not be confused for any claim of quality, and I can't vouch for it's quality as I have yet to try it, though it and it has garnered it's own food awards as well, proudly displayed in the front).Get ready to face a long queue that doesn't move very quickly if you decide to visit on weekends, or peak meal times (11-2pm, 5:30-7pm) They usually sell out before dinner though. Another must try is the Prawn Mee, if you are a fan of seafood. The stall can be found almost directly opposite Selera Rasa and a bowl will cost you about $10 if you decide on the big juicy tiger prawns. I love the soup and the prawns are consistently fresh for the times I have visited. New to singapore or just visiting for a day? If you've heard tonnes about our hawker food culture and cant decide between the many famous venues? Then let me strongly recommend Adam Road Food Centre for being accessible (central-ish location) and not too overwhelming with their choices. (like lau pa sat

This is close to where we live so is a good place for us to eat when we don't know what we want for dinner but don't want to travel far. This food centre is not one of the big ones so you will need to go early as it gets quite busy. The Rojak here is good
4
We love the sting ray, sotong bbq and their sambal kang kong. The ayam penyet and nasi lemak stall are good too.
5
I like the mutton soup,,,fantastic,,,for me Adam Road Soup Kambing tak boleh ANG'S. better than Boonkeng's. But its really depend on ur taste. But its nice. The Indian food also nice, For me i just can get wateva i want there. Favorite makan place,,,
3
Try the famous Nasi Lemak at stall number 2. The dessert stall sells pretty good local deserts. You can also try the malay food stalls here, they have pretty good choices. If prawns are your thing, try the 'big prawn mee' stall.
5
The soup is tasty and the prawns are fresh. You must eat with the yellow and rice noodle. The desserts are good too with many varieties to choose from.
3
The nasi lemak is really good, with queues to prove so. But the wait is worth it! Besides that, the fishball noodles is also good... The prawn mee broth is really strong though.
4
We go here often. Parking is terrible, it is always full but it is a 2 minute walk from Botanic Gardens MRT station. There is a good selection of food and a great Nasi Lemak place (can't remember the name but you will see the line (2nd from the end). It doesn't have great Indian food (I would go to Empress Market for Indian instead) but the Indonesian, Malay, Singaporean (I think...still learning my food types) food I have tried there is good. Love the satay sticks. There are seats under umbrellas in the centre with plenty of room for a stroller and baby. If it is raining there are other tables you can also get the stroller next to and won't get in the way of people. I like it because it is smaller and a nice vibe about it as it doesn't seem too rushed and there is a great mix of people (business people to families to construction workers) if you like people watching
4
Doughnut shaped foodcourt with foodstalls all around the outside, closely packed colourful yellow tables around a central courtyard.Great range of Chinese, Indian and other Asian dishes. Always busy with locals - that's gotta be a good sign! But parking is limited, so you might have to wait for a spot at busy times!
4
Our local friend took us to this hawker centre. Tried the famous hokkien mee, prawn mee, satay, cha kueh, chay kue tiaw. Was a good time to try all the food at one place. Went at night so the famous Nasi Lemak stall was not open. If travelling by MRT, the nearest stop is Botanical Garden and the place is about 10 mins walk from there
4
It's hard to find settings lie this in Singapore anymore. Yes, they serve one of the best nasi lemak (coconut rice)... For tourist, this is a must try dish. The best nasi lemak in Singapore is partly due to the type of rice they use. :-pJust look for the queue. Other things to try are the Cheng tng (dessert) and crab noodles and also get a drink (milo dinosaur or teh terik) from one of the friendly drink stores! Indeed an old gem in Singapore hawker centers history!
4
There's two nasi lemak stalls here and both have won many awards. But go for the one that's on the left, by the corner. Though there's a constant long queue, trust me, it's worth the wait. The nasi lemak here is one of the best that I've eaten and I always come back for more. In fact, it's the only dish that I order every single time I come here!
5
this place has the best Nasi Lemak across the entire island (2nd stall). Large variety of other food is available but nothing else comes across as fantastic.
5
Excellent breakfast and lunch place. Love the Nasi Lemak, prawn noodles,etc. Will come here with colleagues and family.
3
the nasi lemak store, the 2nd store (not the corner one) is delicious. a little pricey for nasi lemak but the rice and chicken is yummy. make sure you order teh tarik to go with it
4
Noisy but it yummmy place to go if your hungry...........
4
a MUST TRY nasi lemak , but parking is a headache!
4
You must try the Rasa Nasi Lemak. It's awesome. One of the best. The rice used is the long grained basmati rice and it's just delicious. Be prepared to wait in the q...
3
Famous for Nasi Lemak (Cocunut Rice), Mutton Soup, Satay and I personaly love the desert store. It's a little out of town (Singapore is tiny) but if you live around here or don't mind taking the taxi, check it out. Ventilation needs improvement so it can be a little hot.
3
I find this hawker centre average at best. So many of my Singaporean friends rave about it but I have been so many times and never find anything that special about it. Location is inconvenient and the facilities aren't even that great. Just average. Give it a miss.
4
Many local food stalls to choose from - All very reasonably priced. Don't miss the nasi lemak - The best in Singapore. Fragrant coconut rice with fish, chicken and sambal chilli. There are 2 stalls with nasi lemak. Don't get confused - The stall to buy from is No 2 Adam Road Food Centre
3
Adam Road is a mixed bag. great nasi lemak and satay. Some good carrot cake.But some loonies there especially the indian drink stall and the juice lady who i try to avoid I contact with..the centre isnt terribly clean but is close to the Botanics and the MRT
3
Seems to be less-crowded when we've visited. Standard hawker fare, but tasty booths to be found.
4
Many of the stalls here sell food that are delicious and tasty. But the place is often crowded during weekends.
4
The go-to place at late nights for Indian and Malay selection of hawker food. Can't go wrong with satay, Indian prata, goreng dishes and teh tarik!
3
Expect long queues for one or two of the better-known stalls such as the nasi lemak and the mee soto stalls. But otherwise, the rest of the stalls are just average. Look out for drink touts.
4
nevermind the fiasco few years back about food poisoning. The food place made a great comeback with the joint effort of every hawker there to upgrade the cleanliness and food quality there. Service got better too. Think the incident had a loud wakeup call to everyone there.Today, I'd say it is the best congregation of good muslim food in the country
4
Let's try to summarise what we are looking at: Malay Food, we have some of the best mee soto, soto ayam, mee rebus, nasi lemak...Indian Food, we have some of the best mutton soup, mee goreng, prata, Indian rojak...local Singapore favorites are also here, prawn mee, fishball noodles, fried carrot cakes, oyster omelets, duck rice, chicken rice...and not to forget one of the finest shaved ice desserts around. All under one roof!!! Why only 4 stars? Well, all of the above need to get their acts together and maintain consistent operating days of the week. It's not uncommon to find 30% of the stores closed for business on any given weekday. Strange
4
The concept of Hawker Center is Uniquely Singapore. From the old day of push carts street food, now they are all housed in a nice, clean and hygienic complex. You can order food from the various different stalls and enjoy them together with your family friends. However, Adam Road Food Center seem to have more Muslim food selection. And the prices are friendly on your wallet too ! Must order are Roti John and the Indian Mee Goreng ! Yummy !
4
First, the atmosphere. The circular layout of this food place gives it a warm and cozy ambience. It is a breeze to go round to see the local food selections of Malay, Indian, Western and Chinese fare. My personal favourite is the stall selling prawn noodles. The soup stock is rich tasting without being cloying or overly "prawny", the prawns fresh and the pork slivers tender enough. The chilli powder (optional) gives added punch. There seems to be a perennial queue there. Over at the Malay section are a couple of stalls selling nasi lemak (coconut milk-flavoured rice and eaten with various side dishes such as fried chicken, fried fish, omelette etc). There's always queues there, too. If you have space in your stomach there's satay (barbecued meat on skewers), Indian rojak, braised roast meats, fried noodles and grilled seafood, among others. To wash all these down, there's fresh fruit juices and sugar cane juice. Try and avoid lunch and dinner hours. It gets rather crowded, and if you drive, may find it hard to get a car park space. And if you do get one, make sure you place enough parking coupons as the parking wardens frequently come by to issue parking tickets to cars that overstay their parking times
4
Adam Road Food Court is the place where you can find some of the local staples at reasonable prices at any time of the day and night. Stalls may change their offerings according to the time of the day. It is a great place whether you go there for a local (predominantly Indian muslim or Malay) breakfast (nasi lemak, mee siam, mee rebus, carrot cake, lontong etc.) or whether you go there for supper (mee goreng, bistik, mutton soup with bone marrow etc.). If you are familiar with the dishes, you will see that e.g. Selamat Datang serves among the best Mee Rebus (yellow noodles in a thick spicy gravy) in the whole of Singapore. IMO Siti Nur Liyana further has one of the best Mee Siam (thin noodles in a spicy broth) and Tahu Goreng (fried tofu with spicy sauce). I also prefer its Nasi Lemak to the ones served by the two famous stalls specializing in the dish. Visitors will recognize these stalls from the long queues that form in front of them. Siti Nur's Nasi Lemak will cost you a fraction of the waiting time and - as I said - it is IMO better but made with normal rice rather than the Basmati rice the others use. Adam's Delight serves a good mee goreng - try the one made with bee hoon (thin rice noodles) and tell them to add plenty of chili for taste.

I took my family to Adams Road Food Center after reading the reviews. It was very average for everything. First, selection wise, 40% of the restaurant shops were closed (Wednesday lunch?) What's up with that? Going out of business? Also, compared to variety of food we've been tasting, it seemed slightly below average or at best average. Having said that, we really enjoyed mango juice, sugar cane juice, and lime juice. I think we drank at least 10 fruit juice for family of 4. The juice was good! I would not go out of your way to visit this food court, but if you're in the area, it might be worth your visit at least for once
3
This is probably the best place to get a taste of the famous Malay breakfast dish - nasi lemak. There are two good stalls there - No1 Nasi Lemak and No1 Nasi Lemak. No kidding; the two neighbouring, but different, stalls have the same name!
5
Nice Nasi Lemak, Sugarcane drink, BBQ fish, Indian Rojak, Prawn Noodles...
4
Nasi lemak, BBQ stingray, Indian mee goreng, delicious soto ayam stall (that always seems to be closed) - what more can you ask for, under one roof?
3
Nasi lemak is fantastic.
the ice kachang is really good too.
Soto ayam is pretty good
Unfortunately, rest of food is so-so.
Not enough variety of good food
4
best tasting rice I've ever tasted. Best value for your money, 3.5S$ for a set of rice, chicken and fish. Wish they can share the secret of their cooking.
4
Great food (esp nasi lemak, Chinese mutton soup) & value for money
4
Good roti johns here in the '90s. Not sure if they are still around
5
Living in between Newton Food Court and Adam Road Food Court, I have been to both numerous times over the last year. There is one hands down winner - Adam Road. It is a small place, with about 20 stalls, serving Indian, Malay and Muslem dishes along side your usual hawker fare. What makes it fantastic is to interact with the stall owners. Nobody is touting for business, all meals are inexpensive, and generally veery good value for money. While the Nasi Lemak may be the main draw, try out the other stalls too. I have yet to be disappointed.If you are looking for high end food and service, this is not the place. If you are looking for the back to basics hawker food, look no further

I am writing this as a local Singaporean who stays in the vicinity of this food centre. I visit this food centre at least once a month to buy take-away food for my family.This is not a large food centre. The centre is generally circular in shape and the stalls are located at the perimeter of the circle. Most of the seats and tables are sheltered and located in front of the stalls. There are a few tables which are located in a small circular open space in the centre. They used to be designated for smoking patrons but that is no longer the case.About half of the stalls sell Muslim or Indian food. A fair number of them sell similar food e.g. I spot at least 2 stalls selling roti prata (a type of Indian pancake). The rest of the stalls sell non-Muslim or Chinese food. There are also a few stalls selling drinks, fruit juices and desserts. I list here the type of food available from all the stalls as far as I can remember offhand -Muslim/ Indian- Nasi lemak- Roti prata- Indian rojak- Mee goreng/ nasi goreng/ mee rebus/ mee siam/ lontong/ mee soto etc- Satay- Mutton soupChinese- Chicken/ char siew/ roast pork rice- Duck rice/ noodles- Fishball noodle- Prawn noodle- Zhi char- Chinese Rojak- Fried carrot cake/ char kway teowJudging by the queues, the popular stalls are nasi lemak (stall no. 2) and the prawn noodle.I personally do not find any food here that is so attractive that I must visit this food centre to try. I have tasted better nasi lemak and prawn noodle elsewhere. Any visitor thinking that there are gems to be discovered here will be disappointed. You will still get decent local dishes at reasonable prices here but don't expect to go off saying "Wow!"The place tends to get crowded during lunch-time and dinner. Because of its location, it attracts a fair number of construction, dispatch riders and other blue-collar workers (and even policemen) who get their meals here. Seats are limited and get filled up easily. There is an adjoining open carpark but it is touch-and-go whether you can get a lot (be patient).In summary, there is a tired feeling to the place. If you are in the vicinity and need to eat, this will be sufficient for you. If you stay nearby and need to get food quickly (like I usually do), this is also the place for you. But it is hardly the place that will merit you going out of the way just to get there to eat

I watched Andrew Zimmern eating bone marrow on TV and wanted to try some. This hawker center seemed a bit dirtier than others and in fact there were some restaurants that had a C rating from the health department. We tried a few dishes from several stools including bone marrow, nasi goren, laksa, satay, etc but I thought they were all sub par. I do not recommend
4
#2 nasi lemak, #13 murtabak/briyani. roti john and sambal stingray!
5
Nasi Lemak, what else? Both stalls are just as good, but the first stall serve a choice of mutton rendang too, which is just SEDAP! Go early, before 2pm or you'll find many items sold out.
4
The nasi lemak is the favourite of the Sultan of Brunei...
4
Great food for cheap!
2
Nothing fancyful. Mostly indian and malay stall.
4
Great variety of food. love the prawn noodles. hate the parking.
3
The roti pratas are pretty good!
4
The beehoon soto n satay is good.. Yet to try the famous nasi lemak..
4
No matter other people say - the Nasi Lemak here is possibly the best in Singapore. Newly renovated too. Go for Adam's Nasi Lemak.

This place is an exercise in extremes. On the one hand, #2's Nasi Lemak, Selamat Datang's mee soto/mee rebus (red sign), Apit's teh (before 4pm - ask for his teh maji) and the Prawn Noodles (before 5pm - the guys at night are a pathetic franchise with unfresh seafood) are pretty good, but for the others, hawking is just a job. Here's a quick sum up : the Chinese and the Indians have lost their heart; it's just a way to pay their rent. The ice kachang/cheng tng and the Sugarcane Plant's drinks stalls are a little above average. Underrated - Siti Nur Liyana's tahu goreng. People still come here looking for good prata - wake up, 1992 was a loooong time ago
5
They serve one of the best "Ice Kachang"
2
parking is always a problem. the prawn noodles is good.
4
Indian mutton soup, Selamat Datang mee soto/mee rebus.

3
Parking auntie comes really quick....must must put coupons
2
decent nasi lemak, but the queues are long, and there aren't many other notable stalls at this hawker center ; unless you like "sup tulang" (bone soup)
4
I love the Mutton Soup!! Good during cold rainny days.
5
Excellent nasi lemak. There are two stall. You want stall #2. It's easy to spot. It's the one with a queue. Don't bother to go past 8:30pm. They'll have sold out and be closed. They open early tho' , so breakfast is an option. Very friend staff
4
Nasi Lemak and Sting Ray

No way I'm ever going back there again.
