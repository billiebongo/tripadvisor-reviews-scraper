Not a fancy place, but the food is wonderful. It's a fun place to walk around and then fill up on some great Vietnamese food. My kids love the Pho. I thought the cold noodle salad, served with fried beancurd and spring rolls were great.

Clean, friendly, well priced and great food.
We went with the family, 2 fussy boys 8 and 12, they loved the cold rolls, spring rolls, chicken and rice, and pho. Adults did too!

Decided to check this place out during the lunch hour. The place is definitely a re-do but hope I don't have to wait 10-15mins for the food to arrive!
The tamarind drink and salted caramel ice cream were awesome!

We visited the eatery at Tanjong Pagar during the lunch time and it was not that crowded. We soon found out why: the beef noodle soup ($10.9) only has a few slices of beefy floating and the broth is not well prepared. Two rice paper spring roll will cost $7! Probably the most expensive in Singapore. If u crave for Vietnamese food, go visit Nam Nam or the one at Essen@Pinnacle. U will find a cheaper and better deal

I regularly visit Pho Stop as it feels like a real escape from the city.Coupled with great prices (the $3 Vietnamese beer 333 is a steal!) and some good food it is a fun hangout spot for a weekday social.Make sure to get up on to the rooftop, you feel transported into backstreet Asia

I have tried some Vietnamese food restaurants in Singapore and every time I visited one, I made my own list. I had my favourite place until a friend of mine introduced me to this place. It was an eye opener and I even thought that I would not go anywhere else anymore other than Pho Stop. The food was so tasty and I could taste the herbs and spices strongly without being overwhelmed by it. Vietnamese dish is more or less the same as other Asian dish, especially its neighbour (Thailand), with the usage of holy basil, mint leaves, chili, etc. The good/authentic ones use those ingredients generously, yet still within a good balance. While others claim to have good taste, but they are not authentic because they don't use the ingredients as "real" as Pho Stop and others might have adjusted the taste. Pho Stop is authentically tasty

Love this place and visit regularly. Go sit up on the roof where you're surrounded by other shop houses and feel like you are in a more vintage Singapore. Also love the happy hour until 9pm - Especially the "333" Vietnamese beer. At $3 a can, we still cannot work out why it is so cheap as it is pretty good! Highly recommend

Went on a Monday night, pleasantly surprised to see a decent dinner crowd (which also spilled up to The Bar Above). Which may have explained the slow service - maybe they were understaffed as they didn't expect a busy Monday? Greatly impressed by the full-page veggie options - which beats most of the other restaurants along the same stretch of Tanjong Pagar Rd. Had the set which included the drink & ice cream - a good deal. Except the coconut ice cream was too sweet - was told later there is the chocolate sorbet which is vegan. Will definitely go back to try other veggie options on the menu. Disclaimer: I had dinner there with a friend, who knows the owner

I had a craving for pho, so my wife and I decided to check this place out (on the back of good online reviews).The restaurant is one of those no-frills type, not unexpected. It was good for what it served. Nice crowd on a Thursday night. Although, we thought they should consider better lighting... it was not easy to take Instagram-worthy pics! ;) We had the deep-fried chicken mid-wings to share, and each had their beef combo feast (pho with beef everything, except no tripe... sadly). The wings were lovely, and the accompanying chilli paste/sauce was nice. The pho had very good broth that has a nice depth of flavour (which I found lacking in a certain XXX XXX Noodle Bar), just enough noodles and a good serving of beef everything. We would have liked more bean sprouts and Thai basil on the side. Good pricing on the beer on tap too! :)Overall, a nice enjoyable meal. So far, my favourite pho place in Singapore (have tried 5 places). I will return to try other dishes. Recommended

An amazing vietnamese cafe tucked away in a busy tanjong pagar road. The phos are very reasonably priced $10-$10.50, and are huge. I personally struggle to see the bottom of the bowl although I have a reasonable appetite. They come with basil, bean sprouts, lime and sauce on the side, and you can request chilly padi if you like your phos hot. Really nice experience

Good food saves this rather sparsely decorated restaurant, which is strange, because this is a real restaurant area of Chinatown on a more-or-less prestigious road, Tanjong Pagar Road. Try harder!
5
I went in here because the restaurant looked clean, had plenty of space, and I felt like Vietnamese food. The service was good, food good and tasty. Free wifi.

We enjoyed a good meal at PhoStop. We had the grilled chicken, beef pho and the spring rolls -all of them were authentic and well cooked. Good food at a reasonable price.
5
The pho is authentic with sumptuous soup base. The appetizers - fish cake & fried spring roll are also yummy.
Located along Tanjong Pagar Road in the heart of the city, this is a great place to taste nice Vietnamese food.

Recommended by friend and decided to give it a try.
Great location, great ambiance, great authentic Vietnam cuisine.
Pho is simply spot on. Will be back to try their coffee someday!

I'm a huge fan of a vegetarian version of both pho and spring rolls. The mushroom broth is very delicate with a taste of sweetness- absolutely delicious! There is one thing which I really don't like- the upstair toilets. Those probably belong to the club but very often they look really messy :( Anyway- food is great!!

I put only 4 stars in this review because I feel the food could be even better with a better tasting meat for example, and it's not as good as in Vietnam, but it's the best Vietnamese restaurant I've found in Singapore so far.We had the chicken pho which was very good, the bun cha gio and the pork bun chan - all was excellent. I personally found the beef pho less interesting, but my friends liked it

I've been to this quaint and modernistic cafe umpteen times and I really love the atmosphere it gives. Tucked along a narrow winding road amongst the hustle and bustle of the city, the cafe is an excellent location for small company events and late night unwinding, romantic dinners, after work gossips and lunch time quick bites. The food is awesome. For the main courses such as noodles, it was not over cooked and the broth, especially the beef one, was thick, delicious and tasty. The chicken salad was also famed due to its large servings of shredded chicken drenched in savouring sauce with tons of healthy fresh cabbage. The grilled chicken was perfectly done to the right taste. Deserts were tasty and innovative, especially the ice cream flavors that had their "flavor of the month", ranging from yuzu to pineapple tart flavors that cater to the ushering of the various festive seasons. Prices are extremely affordable especially given its central location; it's difficult to find a satisfying wholesome meal for less than 15 dollars in that area and this place makes it all happen for you.There's a bar above as well that opens late and drinks are equally affordable. Ambience was good with alfresco options. Mood was perfect and if u are looking for a quiet corner with a few friends, this could be the place to go. Not much to fault about this awesome place, and that's why I have been there many times. Highly recommended.

I was trying to find a quiet place to eat when I saw the cantine like dinning room of Pho Stop a vietnamese eatery.The lemon grass drink cold is delicious with a rich taste and a actual lemon grass root in the glass.The fresh rolls were indeed fresh and crispy bit lacked a bit of herb aromaThe grilled fish with rice was a perfectly marinated fillet of flat fish fresh and tenderOverall a nice no fuss good little vietnamese eater

Came here for lunch with a colleague and it was quite crowded. Nevertheless, I ordered the beef pho. It came really quickly and was nice, flavourful and hearty. The ice-creams they have are really good though (I had the coconut while my colleague had chocolate), albeit a little too sweet for me. But overall, a great place to have decently priced and authentic Vietnamese food
