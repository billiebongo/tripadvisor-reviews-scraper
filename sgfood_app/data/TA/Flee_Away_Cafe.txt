Average coffee shop with relatively quick service. Nothing out of the ordinary at this cafe. Coffee varieties are decent.

My friends and I enjoyed our little gathering at Flee Away Cafe on Saturday evening. The decor is nostalgic and charming, with lots of little toys and a huge plane, seemingly to transport us back to our childhood (for those born in the 60s and 70s). The truffle fries has a light buttery flavour that was tasty but a bit too salty for us. Banana and peanut butter milkshake was smooth and not too sweet, and it could use more banana. The Le Char Kuey with dry laksa is greasy but satisfying and full of delicious flavour, a good balance of coconut and shrimp and spice and chili and laksa leaf. The laksa pasta was rich and aromatic and very authenticly peranakan. The mud pie with irish cream was delightful. Service was prompt and friendly

First and foremost the employee at the counter was incredibly friendly. It was a hot day, as always in Singapore, and having the employee greet me was awesome. I enjoyed the choice of music, which was at a perfect volume.Then, as a person who eats tons, the food was great! I originally entered just wanting to sit and relax, then drink some tea. However, I saw their food options and was tempted by the Alfredo; I was impressed with the quality and portions for a cafe in Asia.The one thing is that the cafe is difficult to find because it does not show up on google maps. I stumbled across "Flee Away" on my way to a different cafe. However, I would definitely return for some more Alfredo.Thanks for the wonderful service

location - little india.premise - filled with little things that are interesting and also cute. good for a place to have a sit down over a smallllll cup of coffee (not worth the 4$)staff - friendly and smilesfood - must try!!! the char kuay baguette. it is very good!!! but can be slightly less costly.verdict - will come back for the char kuay baguette but not for coffee.... sorry but the portion was far too small to swallow (punt intended) overall, the cost of the food does not justify the portion. Yes, the coffee was good and so was the food but at 2 coffees (very small cup) + 1 char-kuay baguette @ 25$

Would not recommend.I walked by Flee Away and decided to pop in for a coffee because it looked quite cute... It's decorated head to toe with toys and airplanes with a somewhat vintage vibe. A very kid friendly appearance, but I appreciated the quirkiness nonetheless. Excited by the ambiance, I approached the counter to order my coffee. The woman working was exceptionally rude throughout our entire interaction. I decided to get my order as take away because of her attitude I did not want to linger there any longer. Upon leaving I thanked her and said "have a nice day" to which her response was "yes, okay" without even looking up at me. I was baffled by how such an adorable place could house such a grumpy woman that acted as if my coffee order was greatly inconveniencing her... and the coffee wasn't even any good

Was in Little India to pick up sarees etc. Found this quaint little cafe tucked away in a corner along Dunlop Street. Needed a cafe to rest my feet from all the shopping. Went in and was greeted by friendly stuff. Decor is retro n interesting. Really cute place in Little India. Ordered a Nasi Lemak flavored cupcake! How special is that! It has sambal chilli in it. Love the mix sweet n savoury taste of this little cake. Recommended if u r not so sure about where to go for a little rest apart from the usual indian eateries in this area.

Our recommendation to this cafe was through a TV programme, location of the cafe is located in the quieter part of little India among the shop - houses, nearest MRT station would be Little India station. But alternatively one could walk from Bugis MRT station too. The food was great recommendable dish would be the laska le char kway & the chicken wings! Another plus point is the excellent service by the service crew which is highly commendable, such service is rarely seen in Singapore. Will come back to this cafe definitel

The place is located at a small alley in little India at Dunlop street. Not hard to find. Can exit using tekka market. Upon entering the cafe was super delighted to be greeted with all the lovely toys that trigger back all your childhood memories. Even the chairs used were so vintage. You can hardly see or find them nowadays. The lights & ambience were so wonderful and makes you feel like home. Tried the signature le char kuay dry laksa which is super delicious. Chicken wings were also marvelous. Spend a lovely afternoon chilling & relaxing & admiring the toys & decorations with happiness. Staff are super polite & cheerful. They make you feel comfortable & homely. Would definitely go back again to try other foods. Thumbs up for Flee Away Cafe!!! :):):

We were two satisfied patrons who totally enjoyed our time here as well as the food and drinks. Some cafes could only be excellent in a certain aspect i.e. if the food was good, the coffee might not be great. Over here, perhaps we were lucky to pick the right stuffs from the menu so all turned out pretty well. Even the service was flawless as Cat made us feel very much at home. She’s a warm and friendly lady with a cheerful disposition and always carries this big smile on her face. It was a joy chatting with her.Flee Away is a befitting name for this cafe mainly because of its location which is a rather quiet and quaint street in Little India. It’s a cafe that we would love to unwind in and relax over a good book and some light refreshments.Can’t wait to come back again soon to try Cat’s new ‘localised’ milkshakes with flavours like pulut hitam and chendol. Genius ideas!For full review of the cafe, please check out http://www.springtomorrow.com/2014/10/02/cafe-hopping-flee-away-cafe-dunlop-street
