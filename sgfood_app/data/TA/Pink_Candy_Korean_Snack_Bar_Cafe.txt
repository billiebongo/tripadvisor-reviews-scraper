Located 5 min walk from Beauty World MRT station.This is a family run Korean restaurant and it offers very authentic Korean food. On top of the common Korean dishes that can be found else where in Singapore, Pink Candy's menu contains quite a few less known Korean delights such as blood rice sausage.The dining environment is cozy but not over the top. The price is very reasonable.Just one thing to remember: they don't sell alcoholic drinks anymore

They have the usual grill meats with veg, rice rolls, soups etc. Lady boss is Korean and there are quite a number of Korean diners. But what's unusual about this place....they serve this amazing deep fried breaded pork chop with rice smothered in an amazing brown sauce and coleslaw. I have found the perfect solution when I want to eat korean but the kids don't want to....they can have the pork chops
