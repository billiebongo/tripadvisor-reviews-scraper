We came here to have a drink away from the kids while we had babysitter. Amazing spot to relax with great views of the bay.. Try and time your visit for when laser show is on. TIP: always book ahead

The rooftop views are dazzling. Service is good. I was just expecting “fine dining” but the food / menu was not very inspiring. I got the steak and fries. Was served very cold with no garnishes and poor presentation. Could only get table salt not even some nice sea-salts. The wine menu was rather limited vs what I would expect. Would return for drinks and appetizers but not a main course
5
This is a swank spot for drinks and food but is also one of the primo spots for skyline viewing. Singapore has quite a lot to see and from this vantage point, you can see the amazing marvel that is the Marina Bay Sands...and much more

Lantern is the perfect place to chill out with your friends. The transformation of the old Collyer Quay into this swanky place is unbelievable. The bar is on the roof top of Fullerton Bay Hotel, with stunning views of Marina Bay Sands and the Esplanade to its left. Lantern is spacious and the seating is comfortable. The weather was cool on the night we visited with a cool breeze. We ordered finger food along with wine and cocktails. The staff (I forget the girl's name) who served our table was very helpful and took care of our orders. She constantly checked with us to take orders from us. However, some of the other staff who carried the food to our table had to be told to clear the empty plates. This is basic service. Overall, we had an enjoyable evening with great service. Thanks to the staff and the girl who served our table

A busy, trendy bar serving food, with great views out towards Marina Bay ...Service was generally good, but nothing exceptional.The atmosphere is excellent in the evening, with views overlooking the waterfront and out towards Marina Bay Sands Hotel, and the every-changing light display over the hotel and buildings in the foreground.Drinks were expensive (even at Happy Hour), but the food was more reasonably priced. We had a snacky ‘Peking Duck’ to share that evening, given we’d been travelling all day from London, and it was tasty.Overall, a perfect welcoming introduction to Singapore within a few hours of landing ..
5
Great view of the Marina Bay Sands area. Lovely setting in front of the pool. Not too high but offers a lovely panoramic view. Good drink selection and we generally order some food to share, sliders, dips etc. The prices are not the cheapest but a fair price to pay for the setting and service is attentive. Will continue to visit!

Looking for a great, relaxed and cheerful afterwork or Apéro experience? Lantern is THE place! Looking straight at Marina Bay Sands without having to work those often exaggerated queues and tourist lines grying to get access there. Enter Fullerton Bay Hotel, take the elevator to „R“ for rooftop, and enjoy a terrific atmosphere on the side of fancy Marina Bay. John Orosco is the very charming Manager of the place, you will be taken care of thoroughly. Enjoy

We did the ladies night that's in every Wednesday. It has amazing ambiance and great food and drinks!

BEST BITSI wanted to come here for the view. And my, what a view! It was also nice that the view wasn't interrupted with many tables crammed into the bar. The bar felt spacious and airy. I thought as the Fullerton Bay Hotel was ranked #1 on Trip Advisor as the best hotel in Singapore, that it's bar would reflect this, sadly not.WORST BITSThe food was terrible. Expensive for little, deep fried pieces of (possibly) food. The drinks definitely felt and tasted different in plastic glassware and were expensive.The staff were too casual - we had to wait too long to be served, even though there was only a few tables of customers. Staff could have been much more professional in appearance, communication and dress when working at this type of bar.Keep walking to Merlion where you will find some wonderful eateries and still a great view. You will just battle with a few more people though
3
The view was amazing- but I was not totally impressed with the quality of finger food given its premium pricing. Another dampener was that good quality wine was served in plastic wine "glasses".Much as I understand there are some "rules" behind this practice, I will not be keen to re-visit
5
This place has one of the best views while having a Tiger, in Singapore.
Not great for food, more snacks than full menu, but the ambiance, staff etc are great. All my colleagues and friends love this place when I bring them down
5
We spend a nice evening here. I’d like to say thank’s to Irina! It’s good to meet somebody Russian speaking in the bar. Irina helped us to make a right choice of drinks, dessert. And espessially thanks to the bar for given birthday cake! It was very delicious! Excellent view! Perfect staff!

Visited with partner on our last night in Singapore. A tad complicated to get to from the street; no signs in (or out) of the Fullerton Bay Hotel, so we did have to ask a couple of people how to get there. However, when you step out of the lift, the view is incredible; luscious greenery, with MBS looming behind. A very special sight. If you don’t reserve, you’ll struggle to get a table. TIP : you can reserve even if you just want drinks (which is what we did) - you don’t have to dine. Really cool vibe and excellent cocktails. We didn’t eat but the food looked spot on. You also have a prime view for “Spectra” which is the MBS light and laser show. Really romantic setting, but equally good for families, groups, friends - anyone really! Would highly recommend
4
I came with my 10 & 14 year old children. Welcoming staff and friendly wait service. Very chilled out atmosphere and stunning views all around. Not an extensive food menu and smallish portions but drinks and view are the main reason to come here. Somewhat pricey, but a must-do experience when in Singapore.
4
Brought my husband here in the evening to celebrate his birthday, and Lantern was so sweet to provide a complementary cake when I only asked for a good seating view. Really enjoyed the view of the Singapore's skyline too
4
We had a great time celebrating NYE 2017 at the Lantern. Depending on your ticket type altered the sort of view you received of the bay. Ours was slightly obstructed but we still had a great view of the fireworks. Drinks and food is on the expensive side, however we felt it was worth it for the views and atmosphere! Would recommend on NYE or a standard Wednesday night!
1
150 sd for rooftop bar access with no cover during pouring rain and half the bar closed off for vip table guests. we got soaked and crap view of fireworks. very poor job, money wasted
4
Very comfortable place to chill with your loved one or to hang at the standing tables with friends. Clear view of the Marina Bay Sands and I made a reservation for my Boyfriend and I which turned out to be quite important despite it being a weekday night. It seems to be popular among expats as well. However there were only two waiters which can be quite hard when you want to order things, but on the other hand you get loads of privacy to talk without someone constantly walking by! The place is open aired but sheltered, so don’t worry if it’s raining.
4
We mostly take friends here for a drink with a view over Marina Bay. The setting is spectacular and the service and ambience is very chilled. It's not cheap but worth a stop for a glass or tw

We had a lovely evening at the Lantern (bookings are essential!!). The atmosphere, ambience, service and river views were excllent, and patrons are able to watch the twice- nightly laser light show from the Marina Bay Sands casino, which adds to this unforgettable experience. The only negative was very loud music which started as part of a special Mexican night, and it really detracted from the atmosphere. The Lantern is not a disco, people go there for a special occasion or a romantic evening out, and softer unobtrusive music would have been better. Needless to say, we did not linger - did not feel like listening to Mexican music while in Singapore. But will definitely be back next year - and will make sure we will not be there when the loud music starts. A beautiful place for a memorable drink or two
4
Not the most breathtaking view in singapore but perfect for a nice and calm drink.
after all the high rise venues in Singapore there swimming pool terrace and Bar was a very nice change and comfortable place.
4
An elegant and quiet terrace to enjoy the stunning view of the Marina area along with excellent drinks.
5
Nice place soft music's.. and many free choice seats ...expansive drink but still ok over all great . Love all the side seats. Thanks
5
Attended a private event at Lantern Roof Top Bar. Service was excellent. The best Satay I have ever tasted, fresh and tender (usually I find Satay tough!). Amazing location and view.
5
This is one place in Singapore which you cannot miss. firstly for the atmosphere which is absolutely amazing and secondly for the view. it overlooks the iconic Marina Bay Sands and the Merlion statue...there is a laser show at 8 PM which is also a highlight and can be viewed from this roof top which is very strategically located. just go there in the evening and don’t forget to reserve your table. the food is awesome the variety of drinks is also very nice. just sink into the feeling of being in Singapore. it is a must must visi
4
Living in Singapore on and off for 35 years ,this is a stunning location as it brings an old building ,nthat we originally used a ferry boarding location ,into a modern facility. jThis now gives you the chance to see the amazing new locations all around you .A very clever linkage of the old and new
3
Although the service was friendly and we got a bowl of free nuts, it was pricey and the mango salad was mediocre at bes
4
This is obviously where the beautiful people hang out (and then there was us!) The location is fantastic, the ambience great. The only negative (apart from the prices) is that the steak frites we ordered turned up lukewarm. I suppose you can’t have everything
2
Was recommended by myColleague to this place. So I brought my hubby here for his birthday. However, food portion was little and overpriced.
3
Good place to take out-of-town guests because of the incredible view. Drinks are expensive (but you pay for the location) and the service was slow
5
Stunning views over the water and the city behind. A lovely place for a cocktail and live music. Great for the Marina Bay light show each evening.
5
Love the rooftop bar with a fantastic view! Love the truffle fries as well as the friendly service at Lantern.
Just hope it doesn't rain! Haha!
4
Lovely location and great view. Nice staff. Very expensive though for the size of the dishes. Not really a dinner venue.
4
This rooftop bar offer unblocked view over Marina Bay, if you are sitting on the side. Unfortunately, our table was in the middle, and the magnificent view was partially blocked by the patrons who loved enjoying their drinks & food standing on their food.Food was ok, with limited choices for vegetarian /vegan. But serving size was smaller than average, and yes, they are pricey, which is understandable as view was priced in.There were light music playing at the background but volume was up as it get latter which was disruptive if you are here for chat/catch-up with friends.Nevertheless, good place to come for the view, and at Level 3 or 4, good for those who are afraid of height but want to enjoy the aerial view over looking Marina Ba
2
Knowing the popularity of this place, we called and know it’s fully booked. We were advised we still can come and have a drink at the bar which was what we wanted to do. Got there and the reception was really hesitated to let us in due to fully booked. In the end we still manage to get in and hang around by the bar. To our surprised there weren’t any bar stool.Ordered our drinks, the bill was brought along together. Bizarrely, they never came to collect and process the bill even after I completed this review. Hope the staff can treat every guest equally
2
Pro: - the view on the harbour Cons: - extrem high prices when you consider the quality of the food- they served the $23+ drinks in plastic (!) glasses- tiny portions and uninspired dishes. We had nachos and guacamole as a starter - it tasted not fresh or homemade at all. Sorry but I expect more for my money.
3
I went there together with my girlfriend on a Sunday night for dinner. We were looking forward to visiting after seeing the raving reviews and beautiful images of Lantern from the internet.First impressions were good when we arrived. We were greeted and ushered by the service staff to our table promptly. We had the Supreme of chicken "cordon bleu" and a Seared black cod fillet. Both dishes were tastefully plated and equally delicious. The serving was small but sufficient. Regrettably, we did not manage to move to the sofa seats facing the Marina Bay for drinks afterward, as the staff told us that the seat is reserved. This does not sit well with me, as I too, made the reservation and requested for a sofa seat one week in advance. Also, while the staff that served us were professional, they do appear tired and uninterested at times. Perhaps it was caused by a more busy and hectic Sunday at Lantern. Overall, we felt that it is a beautiful location to visit and have dinner. However, it feels a little too touristy for my taste, so maybe once is enough for me
5
During the day, the swimming pool is very quite, but during sunset the bar and restaurant gets very busy and noisy, but with such good vibes
2
No smile. Rough behavior. I was verty much surprised at such attitude in spite of the first class hotel
4
If you're looking for a place to have a drink in Singapore, that's affordably priced, then I'd suggest coming to the Lantern. Go through the Fullerton hotel's main entrance and make your way past the lobby to the elevators. Then head to the top floor where you'll not only find the bar, but also the hotel's lovely pool. Go during their Happy Hour ($12) and enjoy one of their cocktails on offer -- I particularly enjoyed their Mojito. Best of all, you can relax with your drink while taking in their panoramic view of the area. Overall, we were pleased with the quality and service, and will definitely come back on our next visit
5
Went for happy hour prior to 6pm where the drinks are S $12 plus tax and service. The staff were very welcoming and were not pushy about re-ordering. It is really a nice spot and a great way to finish our visit to Singapore.
5
A group of friends had drinks last week at the Lantern Rooftop Bar. Definitely did not disappoint. It’s was a nice and breezy evening and the atmosphere was wonderful. We had a great view of the laser show across Marina Bay!!
5
Was many times here and its great place. Very good service and drinks quality.
Also an amazing view of Marina Bay area. Recommend for tourists especially!
4
We meet friends here,It was one of the most relaxing places I have ever been for afternoon drinks. The view is amazing and the ambiance was great.
5
Cool nice clean place nice music and many private seats ..
Romantic beautiful view
We love it... give more discounts thank you
4
Love the ambience on Friday nite. Very relaxing and beautiful night view. Will be back again. Drink is good and food is not bad also
4
Affiliated with the tony Fullerton Bay Hotel, this Bar has great views of the harbor, a cool scene, with good food, service and drinks. The views though will keep you coming back. Well worth checking out, about 2 blocks from Merlion.
4
Truffle fries and wagyu sliders are classic dishes of this bar. Very impressive views over marina bay and great cocktails and wine selection. However service isnâ€™t always great, even if you are a Fullerton Bay hotel guest..
5
we enjoyed just the bar, service wasn't good but drinks great and view amazing, however, each time we asked something to bring, they did, but each time we needed to ask for extra nuts water et
5
One day during a rainy evening In Singapore , we decided to go to this bar, as it has a roof and it was recommended by a lot of people in internet. The staff was very friendly and they brought us to a nice place having the best view over Marina Bay Sands. Alternatively you get a table with the view over the hotel's pool. The cocktails are very delicious, they also offer mocktails (cocktails without alcohol), just ask the staff about.
5
Impressive location and view point. This is a must to immerse in Singapore skyline. It is a unique experience that are reflected on the bill. 32 SGS the Singapore sling......
5
Yes, this place is expensive but you're paying for the whole experience here. Imaginative cocktails, fantastic service and a view that can't be beaten.
5
Very good atmosphere. Service was great. Got ourselves a superb view of the marina bay sands. All requests fulfilled.
4
Great view and atmosphere. Really nice set up. Been there a few times, the staff is new each time. Fantastic view of the Marina Bay and the MBS Hotel
5
Gorgeous hotel with a swimming pool and a bar on the roof. You can have something to eat or just have a drink in this quiet place. Cocktails ~26$. Soft 10$. Beautiful view, binoculars at disposal.
4
This restaurant is located on the roof top area of the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Great weather meant ,no wind or smog with clear views across to The Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands Hotel and lots of other lit up local high rise buildings added to the atmosphere. A light show on the buildings opposite was good.Not a large food menu ,but there are some great item on the menu. I had a lobster roll that came with fries. Every at the table tried them and they were so good we ordered another large serve just by them self.It is suggested that you book or you may have trouble getting a table ,its the second time I have been there and definitely wont be the last
1
I was very disappointed with the reception we received from the hostess staff as we asked if we could come for a drink. We were told the bar was hired for a private function and that there were a few tables available to the side but these had been given to other people, it was clear they didn't want us there despite abiding to the dress code. What I find disappointing is the fact they don't mention the bar is closed for a private function on the website, if it stated that we wouldn't of wasted our time and money coming. Not really any apology so wouldn't return as would take my money elsewhere like Marina Bay Sands, better views and nicer staff.
4
A very good relaxing bar with an awesome view. Happy hour beer is affordable at $12/pint. Food was alright
5
A great relaxed bar with incredible views over the bay. Extensive cocktail menu, wine list, and snacks, and great deals and packages on food and drink to try. Make sure you request a table with a view for the best experience.
4
Lantern is located on the rooftop of Fullerton Bay Hotel. The ambience is terrific overseeing Marina Bay skyline. If you visit at night, you can even catch the hourly light shows at Marina Bay Sands. Food has their hits and misses but will recommend their pizza. Prices are generally on the high side but you are paying for ambience and service. Three of us paid over 300SGD for our dinner and drinks
5
The Lantern Rooftop Bar is one of the best place to watch the laser light shows from Marine Bay Sands! It had great ambience and serves good finger food and drinks. It's a wonderful place to spend an evening.
5
Stunning!
Best bar I've been to in the world!
Expensive but worth a visit.
Photos can't capture the amazing atmosphere.
4
Great view overlooking mbs, floating platform etc. But it's a little humid, as the wind is not strong enough.
5
I popped in for a drink, to be greeted by happy hour- drinks were half price!
The staff could have been more attentive, however the views are amazing.
5
This rooftop, poolside venue is well worth a visit in Singapore. A lovely place for cocktails or pre dinner drinks with a perfect view of Marina Bay Sands. Our party also enjoyed some tasty snacks and nibbles. There is music playing and the whole ambience had a special feeling. Would visit again
5
Just went put for a a quick drink on a Friday evening to catch up with some friends who were there. I am sure it gets crowded the later it gets and a lot of high earners and tourists go there.Bit it was still reasonably quiet when we were there and the view really is very nice. Like the swimming pool in the middle and that it is so spacious. Definitely good for dates, or pre-clubbing drinks, After work catch up drinks, etc. but of course the beverages are not cheap
3
Went here last night with friends for a reunion. There were no tables left (fair enough - busy Friday night) and we were told that we were 4th on the waiting list for a table.First problem came when we tried to order - I asked what dessert wines they have, to which I wad told 'we only have white and red wines' and that if I wanted something sweet, I should have a cocktail. To be fair their cocktails were really nice.We then proceeded to stand by the terrace to see the view. After 5 minutes a waitress approached us and asked us to move, as the people on the table behind us had complained that they could not see the view....We moved. Another 10 minutes later we were approached and asked, and I quote 'do you want to stay here? It is very busy, and we will not be able to give you a table, and it is very crowded. There are other places in Singapore you can go to'. So we left. Very, very disappointing and really not worth it with such rude staff
5
Brought a friend there for some farewell drinks and she loved the view. Requested for a nice seat when making reservations and they did remember and gave us some seats with great views. Tables are well spaced out too so it doesnt give you a cramped or congested feel.They have some nice cocktails and food were decent. Prices are a little pricey compared to the other bars in this area. But with the nice view, I would recommend a visit. Nice place
4
A wonderful rooftop bar with great views of MBS and the esplanade. I prefer visiting here compared to MBS or Altitude as it's much more relaxed and the serous excellent. The only downside is that there is normally less breeze here compared the higher bars. The drinks are great but the difference is the venue.
4
Love coming here as the views are stunning and although the service can be patchy, ok if you get the manager/sommellier but not if you're waving frantically at the rest of the staff.... wines and food are good as are cocktails and atmosphere is amazing. Best sky line in the world helps too
3
The location is very nice. It basically is a cocktail bar that does server food as well. Food is decent but not start quality. The reason to go is the ambiance.
4
My daughters and I enjoyed lunch and cocktails here twice while staying at the Fullerton Bay Hotel. My daughters are both vegans are they were thrilled that there were vegan options.
3
Many reviews use very positive words like "fantastic". Well, the view is good, but strange to term it fantastic. You get a small body of water, and then the MBS building. Lantern is perhaps on level 7, so it is a bit low level. View while lounging at pool is probably good. Perhaps better than at the SUPER NARROW pool at the top of MBS. Lantern uses nice plastic cups for drinks. Seems fine to me. But the usual reason given regarding safety poolside seems a little glib to me, as I saw beer bottles and porcelain plates used. Food is ok. Overall experience is not bad. If you are around the area, certainly ok to go
5
Attended an event held at the Lantern and was wowed by the views of the entire Marina Bay. We were also in luck as the National Day Parade rehearsals were in full swing and had close ups of the fighter jets and especially the helicopters as they flew by. Drinks and food was fixed by the event organizers so I can't fault the Lantern as they were so so. Otherwise, good place to hang out.
4
The view is magnificent at night, you can see all of Marina Bay with the beautiful lights. The ambience is lively but still sufficiently sophisticated, so it is a good place to bring VIP guest so they can enjoy one of the scenic spots in Singapore. Service is okay, food and drinks are overpriced, but I guess most people go there for the view. It's a shame that all the drinks are served in plastic cups (that look like proper cocktail/wine glasses). Although it is for safety as there is a swimming pool in the area, drinking champagne out of a plastic flute takes the whole experience down a notch.
5
My cousin had booked a table here for the 6 of us for pre dinner drinks. Having been to the bar at the Marina Bay Sands during a previous trip to Singapore I can say that this bar superseded my expectations. The view is stunning and the bar itself is lovely. The cocktails were delicious and overall we had a lovely evening. On occasion it was hard to get a staff members attention to order another round, but I would say this was a positive as we had one of the nicest seats and it made me feel like they weren't trying to rush us out or get another table in. Book before you go to get a nice comfy seat as some are more like bar stools
5
Walking through the foyer towards lantern you know you're in for something special. As soon as you exit the lift the view in front of you is perfect. Why sit in marina bay sands when you can sit at lantern directly opposite and view the amazing sites. The drinks are well priced, we ate dinner and again was happy with what we spent & the food that arrived. Book a table for sunset and then watch the water & light show over the bay once dark.
5
One of the best bars in SIngapore - okay im biased towards open bars :) but few things are great about this place - Location - offers a splendid view of the MBS and you get a nice breeze depending on when you are visiting. Quick Service - Its inside a 5* hotel so you should expect but still im mentioning this. Amazing Martinis - Must try as the serving is large enough and do make it very well
5
Possibly the nicest rooftop bar which affords a great view of Marina Bay - time it right and you can catch the light show - reserve if you want a seat. Their passion sling is made with love. A lovely location to meet up after work and feel special
4
Have to reserve to get a good seat. We were walk-in and lucky enough to see the light show from Marina bay sands-amazing. The light of the bar was so dim that the tasty food can't be observed and taken photo of property. Service great. I have to mention the chips there is yummy although the price is $$$
5
Top location on Fulltons Bay Hotel Rooftop Pool - they had a live DJ during the evening we have been there. Prompt & fast service and an outstanding view of the marina.
5
We went to the Lantern rooftop bar at the Fullerton bay hotel on a recommendation & we were blown away by the views of the Marina bay sands hotel & surrounding sights.
The cocktails aren't cheap but well worth a visit for the fabulous views.
4
Lantern has a great view of the Singapore Skyline. My friend and I enjoyed our girls' night out there. Drinks were about hotel prices. I paid about 28 for my Mojito Royale but it was good in my opinion. We had truffle fries at 19, not the biggest portion out there but I think still reasonable by hotel standards. I would return for the ambience more than anything else
5
Had pre dinner drinks on a recent trip to Singapore.The view is spectacular! Drinks were also great
5
I went for dinner and drinks with my family (5 adults and 1 child). It was a great experience! The waiters were pleasant and professional, especially Germalaine. Loved our experience there
5
I go chill out with my friend ,we decided to having dinner and drinks some cocktails , we looking for a good bar , finding on browser , and suddenly lantern bar came out . we decided to go to there, and surprisingly , the bar was really amazing with beautiful view , everybody was really great and friendly , especially our server , REGAR, he came to us and introducing about himself , then he toke the order , he give us really warm smile , when i asked something , he always answer with a beautiful smile , really had a good evening there , and i'm sure , lantern is the best bar in singapore 
5
This place is very well decorated. It's above the fullerton bay hotel but not very high. However, you will get a nice view to MBS and city hall from that place. You will be able to there nice swimming pool for their hotel guest. Service is good and staff very helpful but this place is a little pricey. It's still a good place to come from time to time.
4
Came to this lantern bar by chance. We were just taking a long walk after leaving the Sky bar. This bar isn't as hustle and bustle as in other Sky-bars or hotel bars, here you will be more relax with the seating and the night breeze.Was also surprised to see the drinking price wasn't that outrageous but rather reasonable. We had a bottle of bottega Gold for 98SGD, rather good value and would recommend it.當晚去過了SANDS的SKYBAR朝聖後.沿著河岸一路走到了這個酒吧.遠離了SKYBAR的人聲喧囂.在這邊喝個小酒享受深夜的微風用另一種方式認識這個城市
4
We had a very good lunch here with a fantastic view of The Marina Bay. Yes it's expensive A La Carte but if you choose the lunch offer you get a salad / sandwich / drink combo for a reasonable price. Also re previous review on plastic glasses it is a pool side bar so Safety Rules apply and it didn't detract from our enjoyment of it!
1
We booked a table for 6 for dinner... a 6 star hotel restaurant.. No booking made (in fact a poor table was reserved for groups above 6 and we were seated there) - no apologies - we lef
5
EXCELLENT and hands on management. Kudos for a very great experience!!! Lantern is a must every time i visit singapore because of the high quality service, drinks and food! The surreal view is a bonus. THE BEST BAR IN SINGAPORE!
4
Nice bar, excellent views, great service, music etc. Nice midweek option for group drinks overlooking marina bay sands.
4
Cocktails and snacks here are great, perfect place to enjoy the evening. It does get crowded however when you are a guest staying at the hotel you do get priority, which is great to know.
5
I and my boyfriend visited Singapore on the last month and we were very looking forward to having drinks in Lantern coz one of my friend told us that it has beautiful nightsight and we should visit. So we directly headed to Lantern, once we arrived at Singapore, to watch MBS lazer show with a glass of mojito. Since it was Friday night, obviously, we expected that the bar would be packed but never expected any private events were being held ever! It looked like we were unable to enter the balcony due to the event. We were so dissapointed and just decided to take some pics and then go back to clark quay bar.While taking pics, one lady from reception, called Anna(? Sorry I'm not sure her name but it sounds like it), approached to us and asked if we need any assistance. So my boyfriend explained abt our prior plan. And then, she, with very charming smile, told us that she can give us smoking area if we would like to. As long as we both are smoking so how could we refuse her offer? We yelled out with the cheer and she brought us to the smoking area with lovely table which was perfect for us. We immediately ordered 2 gls of special mojito that she offered to us and it was great. Although we cldnt have entered to the balcony, the climate and circumstances and drinks were really nice. After that we ordered more drinks and went to the enterance once again and ask Anna to take us some pics. She welcomly took our camera and shoot many beautiful pics for us. Even it was only few hours exp in Lantern, I and my boyfriend impressed a lot from Lantern, Anna(reception), drinks and the view, everything. Please send our sincere thanks to Anna. She was so sweet and lovely. I'd love to visit Lantern again when I be there.
5
Excellent bar to visit. The only thing they need to change plastic for glass cups. Other than that PERFEC
3
For sure we paid the view and the location but the food was very regular even if the service was very appropiate and nic
5
Rooftop bar on the Fullerton Bay hotel with expansive views of the Marina area and directly across from the Marina Sands. It sits directly infront of the infinity edge pool for the hotel. Drinks are pricey but lots of good people watching and an amazing view
5
I have invited friends to have some drinks n finger foods socialising after work at the Bar.By the way we found the thin crust pizza tasty and delicious.Thus I recommended to frequent the Bar after sunset and relish the captivating night scenery of the surrounding area harbour.You are paying for the night view though and it is worth it from my viewpoint.The Bar did have the best vantage point of the surrounding harbour view and no other Bar commands that privilege.That relates to the pricey food and drinks menu.It is a Must To Do list if you are in Singapore for first time
4
We had a look at this establishment during the day when no one was there and it looked ok. As is so often the case, our return visit in the evening after a meal at a close by restaurant (La Brasserie) was very different. This is a very cool bar with just amazing views of the Marina Bay precinct all lit up at night. I did read about poor service in previous reviews but that was not our experience. The drinks services was excellent and the staff were warm, friendly and very efficient. The only reason that I did not rate Lantern as a 5, was the cocktails could do with a little more attention. The Espresso Martini was ok but somewhat watery. The Long Island Ice Tea was the pick of the bunch. Nail the cocktails in this bar with amazing ambience and you have a 5 star rating on next review. Yes, I would definitely come back
2
Beautiful place and good quality food but the service is really slow and lacking during the day (when there are actually lots of staff for very few customers
5
Going out to Lantern with friends was great. The music was cool. Views of MBS great and the food was fantastic. Service as expected was impeccable.

Great place to have a rooftop drink and view of Singapore . Excellent view of marina bay sands and my favourite bar in Singapore . Check out their happy hour pricing .
5
Definitely worth a visit. Lovely setting overlooking the harbour, with a swimming pool next to you. Not cheap but worth going for one.
5
Amazing view of the whole Marina Bay area.
Drinks are okay, have a singapore sling (quite sweet) cocktails.
1
The bar is nice and a had an ok atmosphere. Unfortunately the hostess and staff seem stressed out and uptight. We found them very rude and hence didn't stay long.

This is by far the best rooftop bar in Singapore - better even than Ce La Vie at Marina Bay Sands. It's at the top of the Fullerton Bay Hotel - go into the hotel and past the lobby on the right and up the elevator. The ambience is amazing as there is a beautiful pool near the bar that house guests can use that has great lighting at night. We were shown to the bar initially to order a Singapore Sling (33 SGD each including tax) and then eventually we were able to secure a seat on a Friday night at midnight. Great views of MBS - there is some sheltered seating but if it was pouring with rain I am not sure you would stay dry. Cocktails and drinks expensive but worth it for the view and people watching. Great staff, good clientelle, all in all I will definitely be back. I loved it here
5
A chic rooftop bar with dizzying views of the city. Lantern is covered, and fans are abundant - so we were never too hot, even in the daytime. A great place to watch the sunset, and the cocktails go down quite quickly when you're drinking among the clouds
5
This bar is very unique! It has lovely views of the Marina and MBS. The wait staff are attentive and polite. There is a pool there as well, so if you have your swimmers on under your outfit you can go for a dip in their pool! The cocktails were yummy and when on happy hour very good prices!
5
Very nice & stylish! Good service & Good view over the bay including Marina Sands.Everybody was very polite and we got a table without a reservation.Cocktails could be a little bit better (too much ice) but overall we had a nice relaxing evening! See you again

This rooftop bar atop the Fullerton Bay Hotel offers great views of Marina Bay Sands. They give you complimentary nuts and the atmosphere is so nice and chilled. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 out of 5 is because it is ridiculously pricey. We ordered a still water and a coke and it cost more than Â£12 which for two non-alcoholic drinks is pretty pricey
4
Here you should not come for the food, even though it is okay, but the main draw has to be the view and the relaxing atmosphere with DJ.
Prices are not low, but I guess you are paying for the view.
4
Fantastic views over the city and Marina Bay. High and open so you get a bit of a breeze - which is always welcome in Sinkers! Perfect spot to wind down after a day of work meetings before heading out for dinner.
5
We booked a table for cocktails to celebrate 10th anniversary on a 2 day whistle stop tour to Singapore. Such smooth service. From arrival to departure staff were fabulous! Stunning view! And they brought us a piece of cake to celebrate! Relaxed atmosphere! Loved it!
4
Wonderful place if you find a seat. Years ago they use to have beds on this roof top. Now, it's all sitting with tables. I think the place is more crowed than before. The views are great, you can see the lazer show coming from the Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino. You are 300 yards across the Sands Hotel ( I am guessing but you need a 1 wood driver to get there) and it's all water until there. Unbelievable what they do with reclaimed land. Singapore is definitely a great city hands down.
5
You've got to visit this bar for a splendid view whilst enjoying a nice drink. The staff and service is excellent
5
This place is my favourite place to bring friends or colleagues when they arrive in Singapore.The view is amazing at night and it's nog so humid because of the breeze.Easy seating.Don't go here for the food though. Menu is limited and it's more like bar food sizes. But for sharing while having a drink it's acceptable
3
Alfresco area thus at the mercy of the weather. Has a great view of Marina Bay Area, drinks are relatively expensive and limited variety of finger food. They seem to be under staffed so service isn't great
4
We enjoyed an afternoon drink and then went back to watch the Marina Sands lights at night. It is a nice view of the water and a nice ambience. It is on the expensive side but very nice place to chill. Staff was friendly and helpful with our nighttime reservation.
5
Not much to say, visit after sun set for some drinks with an astonishing view. All seatings are well positioned for good view, no worries. No need to go into food or drinks detail, this is like a check for your Singapore visit. Not for families and solo travelers but couples, friend group
5
Really enjoyed going to the Lantern with a group from work. Very pleasant surroundings, good service, good food and a fantastic view. Little bit pricey though the quality of everything made that much easier to swallow.
5
Our group enjoyed a few drinks and light snacks on a warm, Singapore evening. A highlight of our trip.
4
Good service, should try the Mojitos and Red Lantern drink. The view is fantastic and the atmosphere reverting.
1
My parter and I dined at the Lantern Bar and had to send back the Crispy Pork as it was clearly uncooked. When we pointed this out the staff removed the item from our bill and included a complimentary pizza. However, my partner became well in the hours after our meal. I notifeid the hotel by email the morning after and no response to date has been recieved. Disapointing to say the least
5
Singapore offers really nice rooftops. Lantern is definitely my favorite one.First of all, the location is amazing. Conveniently accessible from the beautiful Fullerton hotel, it has a view on the bay, facing Marina Bay Sands hotel. It also has a pool on its main deck.The cocktails are also pretty good. We had appetizers and the food tasted really good. The music is relaxing which to me is a big differentiator compared to CÃ© La Vi or other bars are Clarke Quay that can get loud really quickly.Will be back again 
4
We arrived 30 minutes late, but were not made aware of the 15 minute late policy. We did not have to wait long for a table. Service was terrible and waiter attending to us did not appear to be interested in attending to us and ignored some of our requests. This is a bar we visit often and this was the first time we had such bad service. Overall the DJ was excellent which was perfect during our visit. Such a shame no one dances. You can't beat this bar for it great cocktails and magnificent views from the comfort of your lounge chair
4
Such a beautiful roof top restaurant and stunning views. Had a very enjoyable evening with colleagues. Will definitely come back on my next strip to Singapore!I'd have loved to give you 5 starts, but the glasses you served drinks in were made of plastic. Hopefully those are disposed off after one use and not recycle.
5
Fantastic Rooftop bar with a great view of the Marina Bay. The service was first class and the staff went out of their way to help. Great selection of cocktails and sharing plates. Definitely recommend visiting the bar for pre-dinner drinks or for a couple of late ones and soak up the vie
4
The starter portions were decent and the view was excellent! The service was great too! Overall great experience :
4
The place is not cheap but neither is it totally over the top. The service for us was excellent but I thought it was because the lady seemed to love her job. Otherwise the place looks understaffed. The food was pretty good as well - the pizza slab was surprisingly better than the best pizza I have had in Singapore. The key here was the wonderful breeze, the hard to explain decadence of the whole set up and the beautiful view! Definitely worth a visit
4
This place gets very busy and you can see why. Undisturbed views of Singapore, from the Central Business District to Marina Bay.It has a great DJ playing fun music and is packed with a varied crowd.Great drink selection and we enjoyed some nice cocktails on our first night.The reason I didn't think it excellent was sadly down to the service. As guests of the hotel, our first night we had drinks with expat friends living in the city here. It was rather slow and a frankly glum and grumpy table service. The last evening before our departure the airport, we wanted to have a final drink and watch the sun set. A sharp and stressed hostess brushed us off and told us there was a private party going on and standing room only. We saw there were plenty of empty tables as it was about 6pm. This did leave a little sad moment so we left for the airport not too long after. I must add that the manager became aware of this and did apologise.
5
I love this place. A rooftop bar at the Fullerton Bay hotel. Not cheap, but for special occasions, with friends or as a couple. You just have to relax and enjoy the view.
4
Very impressive rooftop bar on the Fullerton Bay hotel.Great views of surrounding Singapore and in particular the striking Marina Bay Sands hotel. I would rate a must do but a warning as very expensive as most of the more higher end bars in this area are. We ordered a Guinness beer and can of sprite and cost $34. The beer was $19 so definitely the most expensive can of lemonade I have ever had. We sipped it "slowly" taking in the views which are spectacular. Do it as a treat to yourself as I think well worth it on a nice day. Get there around 8 to 8:30 as Marina Bay puts on a light show which you can take in.
5
In closure to our travel to the Singapore F1 race we had treated us to a stay at the Fullerton Bay Hotel and subsequent last drink on the Rooftop bar. What a view over the race track on towards the MBS. Great drinks and friendly staff too
2
Out travel agent booked us a table to see the marina light show. There is most certainly a beautiful view but drinks and nibbles were stupidly expensive. Three pints for two of us plus a serve of tiny sliders and fries cost over $200 and the food was average. Disappointed.
1
The scenery is good but service and glassware are quite below than expected. How could we imagine to have wine with plastic glass. Wine list is not that achieved five stars hotel facility. They are not allow to BYO even the list is not that standard. It should consider flexibility to fulfill customer satisfaction Value for money is something to be considered.
4
Situated on the rooftop of the Fullerton Bay Hotel, its views are stunning. Opposite the Marina Bay Sands with its iconic 'ship like" structure . Drinks and service are very good and prices are high which is to be expected. An excellent choice for drinks at sundown, relax and enjoy the experience
4
Overall good experience with service and ambience. Am a fan of rooftop bars. Staffs are attentive and service is prompt. Had a couple of cocktails and no complains. Just a point to note. Would apppreciate if real glasses are used instead of plastic ones. I think my Negroni taste better with a sturdy glass. Just a point but my visit is pleasant
5
The lantern has a lovely view of Singapore and sits right opposite the marina bay sands. I usually like going there when the sun is about to set, but it's just as beautiful in the night. The drinks are great but the food menu is rather restricted if you get there late. Strongly recommend you make a reservation as its a popular night spot.
4
Views are great over Marina Bay. This place is a great go to. Dont be fooled though, for these prices you get drinks served in plastic glasses... seriously. If that's a turn off for you, and it should be, find another bar with as good of a view and let me know
5
We have been once in this Bar and it was a great evening. A wonderful place to be, very good service in a nice designed top roof bar. All in all a great spot at Marina Bay with very good drinks and cocktails. It`s one of our favorites
5
Nice bar with a romantic view of Singapore. The bar is pretty spacious and not so smoky. Guest are still able to have chit chat comfortably. Service is pretty good. Cocktails are great. I ordered Sweet Passion Sling, it was sweet and refreshing.
4
Excellent roof top bar with amazing views. You don't have to be a guest at the hotel to go up to the bar. The infinity pool is very cool to see. Go at night, because it's just great with all the lights.
4
nice chill out place after work albeit crowded. nice service staff. the place is quite crowded on friday so do make a booking. but i love how the place make me feel relax, have a drink and bite after work. nice ambience
1
i was celebrating with a friend in June 2016 and decided to go back to the fullerton bay roof top bar. this bar is well located on the marina and offers great views of the city facing the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. great ambiance, but sadly that is the only thing about the Bar .we were celebrating so we ordered champagne which was served in plastic glasses. Service - well there isn't anything to shout about. They bar was over crowded and the service was slow. frankly speaking i wouldn't go back to the Fullerton Bar. Just too may other options where the service is better and champagne is served in proper glassware. i suggest the Bar Manager reviews how drinks are served and in the bar and polishes up on the servic

I am writing this review because of the bad customer service that we received. I wanted to celebrate my husband's birthday here, so I called their reservation system in advance to book a table for the two of us. The lady on phone told us that Lantern is a walk-in place, so they can't actually do a prior reservation. So, when we reached there in the eve, the first thing they asked us was whether we had a reservation or not. I was surprised and told them what the lady on the phone had told me. They completely ignored what I was saying and then told me that all tables are reserved and they can only give us a standing place. I got very angry, but since we did not want to spoil our evening, we went in. We stood at the bar counter for a long time, but nobody was ready to take our order and yes the bar was not overly crowded !! Then after sometime I lost patience and we finally left without having anything. This experience actually spoiled our evening. I have no idea why they gave us wrong info on the phone first of all !!! Overall had a very bad experience
5
My friend was celebrating our birthday there and had an arrangement for a nice corner at the rooftop bar. But because I would like some food, I wanted to seat on another table.So they helped me arranged that as well. But what really made them better was when we were told before hand that we were not allowed to store a cake in their fridge. So we had to settle for a giant super market panda cake. However, Jason the Mixologist there went the extra mile and gave the birthday girl a complimentary chocolate cake and helped us decorate our cake as well! Thank you very much!

Me and my girlfriend stayed 1 night in Singapore for transiting and visited here on our way to Sri Lanka.I was expecting a romantic night so I’d made a reservation weeks prior our arrival. Even though I did so still we were kept waiting for over 10 mins at the entrance while the reception lady arguing loudly with some other crew thru the wakie-talkie. Waitresses kept walking around you but no one seems to care what you want. We have to wave our hands several times until we can really get one’s attention. Not to mention all the cold faces. We then couldn’t wait to finish our drinks (in 30 mins) and foot the bill. Due to the poor service I decided not to pay a tip but when the waitress took our bill and money, she never came back. After another 15mins we finally decided to leave. Guess I’ll never want to come back again
4
Booked to eat here and have come ktauls whilst watching the bay light show The food was very nice, cocktails were good, yes it's a little expensive but you're paying for the viewA really enjoyable experience only reason for the 4 rating was that the service was slow at time
5
Reservations a must if you want a table let alone a table with unblocked views of the bay. Service was attentive, music was trendy and upbeat. Finger food was delicious and they currently run a champagne promo so an excellent reason to head over to celebrate a successful 2016. The crowd is predominantly drawn from the numerous financial institutions based around the area as well as the MNCs.

We went to the Clifford Pier for a drink and after waiting for about 15 minutes for a waitress to come we decided to go to the Latern Rooftop Bar, it was a Monday evening so quite quiet, we were taken to a great sofa with excellent view and given our menus etc., we ordered our drinks and some food, the drinks arrived quickly, the food took a while but was very nice when it arrived. That was it, no more service, we could not find any staff to service us further drinks or clear away our empty plates, my husband finally went to the service point and the waitress came over and took our order, but did not clear the table or fill up our water glasses, as mentioned by other people it is very expensive and very poor service. The location is great, I imagine very hot in the day time, you can see the light show in the evening from the bar and good music. We are staying here for New Year, so lets hope they get their act together!! Jason the bar manager did finally come over to see us and tried to put things right
4
Boasting a simply breathtaking perspective of the city landscape is worth the entry by itself.
Coupled with conforming cocktails and scrumptious bar bites makes for a most enjoyable evening!
5
I really enjoyed a wonderful night out at the Lantern Fullerton Bay! The views are breathtaking and the environment friendly. The drinks are expensive but made to perfection and they do offer snacks to go with the drinks. The facilities are suitable for large groups or a romantic night just for 2!! The swiming pool is an added bonus. Beautiful location and really nice roof top bar
5
Great vibe at this rooftop bar , music was kicking and everyone was having a good time. Drinks , especially cocktails were excellent and went down a treat. The view of the bay and looking over to Marina Bay Sands is beautiful .If you want to unwind after work on a friday night or pass through on a saturday night to have a few drinks and take in the view then head down to Lanter
5
It was one of our best experience to attend one of the event of a wedding which was fully drafted and crafted at Fullerton Hotel Singapore The view from the bar is amazing You can see the sky line of Singapore Specially MBS is worth watchingWith the passage of time from evening light to night You can see the changeThe bar service was too goodNon stop appetisers and drinksGood fun .... Enjoyed to the fullest
5
Imagine a marquee on the roof of a posh hotel, overlooking the river and with one of the finest views in Singapore. Afternoon or evening it is a great place to relax and try one of the many drinks on offer, pricey? yes, but what do you expect
4
So I came here around 11am and I must have been the only people here who was not here for the swim. It was HOT. They were not really catered for people yet but the waitress was good and did a lot of running around for us. It may seem heartbreaking to pay $28 and up for essentially hawker food - but it was worth it. One would never find so much chicken in the chicken hor fun at any other hawker centre. The lobster /scallop carpaccio was good. The view was also really great at this time. Would recommend it again but maybe during the evening time
2
We've been at Lantern a few times and love the view, the menu and the drinks. This time the staff was a discourteous as it gets in Singapore, had no clue how long tabe table wait times were and were quite unattentive while we waited at the bar for a table without any intention of serving us drinks. We went downstairs to Landing Point and got some amazing service there.
4
Went up during happy hour ( 11am -6 pm ) beers $12 and some cocktails $12 ++ tax of course , lovely place to relax and enjoy the incredible view and relax enjoying the space . Not busy at happy hour times ,so plenty of tables and good service . Well worth a visit to relax and sock up Singapore 
3
... And the view is what you come here for, and it is also the best thing you get. This place aspires to be a classy rooftop bar, but it is more a tourist/ business stop, with no character of its own. First, it is hard to get a table with some good view (booking mandatory). Second, staff members are attentive but very busy - there are simply not enough of them around. Third, drinks in plastic glasses - really? And fourth, the place is overpriced for what it has to offer.One thing that was really good was the music - catchy and well-targeted 80s/90s style mix. End of story
5
as a guest at the Fullerton Hotel one can use the facilities here and charge expenses back to your room. The pool here is much better than the one at the Fullerton so we tend to come here have a swim and have some lunch - The lunch menu is simple but tasty and with a choice of things like sliders, Pizza, club sandwiches etc its simple. Its pricey like Singapore in general, but we like the view and its a bit of an oasis in the centre of town. It would be hard on the wallet to spend a night drinking here, but for a light lunch and a beer - its perfect. Did I mention the truffle oil fries - OMG!! YU
5
Excellent location, great service, fantastic atmosphere. Small groups (4 or less) can sit with uninterrupted views of Marina Bay Sands - perfect for the nightly light shows.
5
When people come to Singapore they always ask for recommendations of where to go - and i love to recommend Lantern.It sits atop the Fullerton Bay hotel, overlooking the Marina. It combines a open air bar feel, with a poolside atmosphere as the hotel's pool is located here.Cocktails are great - and wines by the glass are also excellent. The service is good and the view is great.Food and snacks are also good - a bit pricey, but then all of Singapore is on the higher side price wise.Enjoy the sun go down as you see Marina Bay come to life! Lantern is a definite must do for anybody visiting the little Red Dot
2
Booked a table with friends for a Saturday evening.Fantastic views. Slow service, got it all wrong and very expensive. Complained and so a deduction was made on the tab, however, service charge was added and we were complaining about the service!The manager eventually was called and agreed to reduce the bill.I find the service leaves a lot to be desired and the quality does not deserve the very high prices. Eventually Zool sorted the issue, but not a good night
3
Horrible start to a bday celebration but ended in not such a bad night after all. I had made an online reservation adding to the comments we are dinning w/a toddler & first time visitor to Sg. Upon our arrival it seems there was a corporate function being held. Wish they could have told us during the reservation. I even called to check if they had receive my reservation. We were seated in the non smoking near the main bar area right in the middle between patrons having a drink and to the other side was the corporate event. First thing I asked if we could be seated else where staff tried to accommodate but felt not too bothered by my request to move, saying weather may change & that outside by the poolside was a smoking area. Soonest the corporate function started I just couldn't bare where we were and asked again I really can't sit here! I asked if we could be seated right at the back towards the gym & toilet area! where mind u there was tables, chairs & umbrellas but the area was not lit up. They said no bcz it may rain which meant if it did then we would have to move again. They offered for us to dine downstairs (which would have been fine) but the main purpose of choosing The Lantern was for the view & ambience. I refused to go downstairs. Out of anger I decided I will take the risk with the weather and said I want to sit in that part of resturant where it was not ready (near gym & toilet area).My point is why couldn't you have offered these tables at the start when asked. The rain was only a drizzle at this point, after 8pm there was no more rain. Through out the night this part of the area became busy with walk in diners anyway. After being so annoyed & upset. The staff made up for it but the evening was already ruined. Although the restaurant offered to cover our champagne, some other drinks we had and our dessert. Really this was not what I had planned for my bday celebration. Would I go back again I am not sure. Maybe because I have too
5
I would say that Lantern Bar is one of my favorite bars in Singapore! It is located on top of Fullerton Bay Hotel and facing Marina Bay Sands. It is beautiful place to catch up for drinks or snack food with your business partners or friends during the day or late afternoon. In the evening music gets much louder and the place turns into the proper bar. Food selection is pretty limited, but I like their fries and selection of satay (fried meet on the sticks) or small hamburgers. The drink list is much bigger and you can try local and international cocktails. The signature cocktail of the place is Singapore Sling. In Lantern Bar you can find few different versions of this classical cocktail, even non alcoholic one. It is also one of the best places to watch Marina Bay Sands laser show in the evening (starts from 8-9 pm).
5
Stopped here after dinner with friends & so glad we did. Lovely rooftop bar over looking Marina Bay, there's a cool DJ playing great tunes and we were soon sipping champagne & enjoying chilling with friends.Love this place, it's sophisticated, great music, attentive friendly staff & the most spectacular views ever.Can't wait to return
4
Visited this place for afternoon of drinks to unwind after sight seeing all day. Nice views (in front of Marina Bay Sands Hotel) Good selection of drinks, can say that cocktails were that good but other drinks were OK! Some staff lacks experience and knowledge but mainly were very good. Have spent good few hours there and have tried their food menu which was Good too
3
It was now my third time at this place. Usually I was quite happy so far as the atmosphere is indeed somehow special, but yesterday they showed their bad side.I made a reservation when I was there few days ago, telling them it's my gfs birthday. They offered a complimentary cake and I asked for a table near the water. Everything has been accepted. Unfortunately they were not able to keep their promises.1) We knew we would be a bit late, so I tried to call twice. Both times their machine hang up after 2.5 minutes in their queue. Nobody picked up the phone!2) When we arrived, we were given a table just next to the speakers which were incredibly loud that evening. We asked for a table near the water as it was reserved like that, but they were not willing to reseat us nor to reduce the volume of the music.3) The complimentary cake they offered also got forgotten. They didn't even mention it anymore.The cocktails were ok, although they brought a wrong one the first time, but that can happen.After this quite disappointing evening - also for my gf - I will think twice before going back to that place. There are many other bars with better service around Marina Bay that are just waiting for my next visit..
5
Great place to kick off a night out. The views are amazing, good atmosphere and just a great spot to be. Very impressive if you haven't seen anything of Singapore before. It is in the pricier range of bars but worth it for the views. Tip for ladies - it's Ladies night on a Wednesday so drinks are free 8-9pm. Booking not required, just rock up.
4
Stunning setting, overlooking the bay in Singapore, including perfect views of the nightly light show form the Marina Bay Sands hotel across the water. Pricey and a very restricted menu, but amazing cocktails. Try the Passion Sling, and their truffle fries are to die for
5
Had fizz and bar snacks at this awesome rooftop bar - spectacular views and ambiance. Expensive but now feeling very chilled!
5
Booked here for dinner and drinks on our honeymoon after finding it on trip advisor. Cannot fault it in any way! Staff were so so accommodating and friendly. The food is great and the views are stunning. Very romantic and worth a visit. Please be sure to book in advance
3
Ideal place to watch the evening light show. The beer was more expensive than the marina sands.What was disappointing is that after ordering a waitress came round giving out fliers for beer that was 10 S$ cheaper than the bar price. I realise that it was a different beer and a 100ml's smaller but it seemed so unfair as the staff would not allow us to change our order
1
We booked a non smoking table for 7pm last Tuesday evening and requested a non smoking table with a great view. Having had dinner here the previous year on a business trip I was really looking forward to a repeat experience. Unfortunately Zana from the Latern front desk chucked us in the smoking section on teh side right at the very back. As a result the customer service was non existent. We would have honestly needed a whisle, light and flare gun to attract the attention of the waitstaff. It was truly apalling.Mojito's were nice when we could finnaly get someones attention to place an order. Didnt bother with dessert as there was no one around to take our order.Will have to seriously rethink coming back here again
5
Last night I had a little drink with my lady and a friend who introduced us to Lantern..The place allowed us to have a really pleasant conversation with a beautiful view on the wonderfully illuminated Marina Bay by night. Since it was dinner time we decided to stay and try the food which was just ok.The best part was the music. The DJ had such a good selection of music; in my opinion it's an essential part in order to spend quality time. Verdict: Atmosphere: 8Service: 7 Food 6Beverage 7Music 9.5 Price: Singapore is expensive anyway! Recommended!
5
The staff turned a disappointment due to miss communication into a wonderful memorable evening. Thank you.While certainly not the highest bar it is an intimate open air, charming space, perched on the edge of the bay atop the Fullerton hotel and has wonderful views in all directions.Whilst on the high price for drinks it is worth the treat for the experience
5
Visited for drinks on our last night in Singapore. Having been to The Lighthouse @ The Fullerton, Level 33 and Raffles Long Bar, was keen to compare and contrast! The Lantern Bar is a vibrant and atmospheric place to watch the sunset and is great for taking in the view and people watching. Huge cocktail menu so lots of choice. Price wise for Singapore is not excessive and would recommend this place. On returning to Singapore, would love to return and would probably stay at either The Fullerton or Fullerton Bay..
5
Love the excellent view of the marinabay here. Service was great too! Top it off with high quality finger-food (sliders & truffle fries), it's always a bar i would like to revisit
4
The Lantern forms part of the Fullerton Bay Hotel property. It forms part of the bar, pool area and the menu is predominantly more of a pool menu rather than restaurant menu. This is a pity as given the location and view, it is missing an opportunity to offer finer dining and finer food. However, the team are warm and friendly and the food consistent and of a high quality. The steak and truffle frites were very good, as was the crab salad. Although the restaurant forms part of the pool, bar area of the hotel, the music that is played is either too loud or alternatively very abstract and seems to have no pattern. It is rare that I would comment on music as being a differentiating factor, but throughout the hotel this seems to be a curiosity of the property. Otherwise, the service and experience was perfect
4
From the late afternoon onwards, one of best places in the CBD for a splendid view of the sunset or a fabulous sight of the Marina Bay at night. Significantly-above-average bar food albeit a bit heavy - sliders, truffle fries, lobster roll, quesadillas, satay; maybe they should add lighter items like Vietnamese spring rolls. The place is small, so make sure you book for best views, especially if you're a large group. Efficient service by staff who are unfazed by occasional spectacle of models in the swimming pool or jacuzzi
5
Wonderful roof top setting with great music, drinks and a killer menu for a meal or midnight snack... Highly recommended
4
Really enjoyable place for a drink at night taking in the Singapore skyline, gazing across the bay whilst listening to some upbeat music. Would drop in here again without question :) Much more welcoming atmosphere than some taller neighbours
4
As per the title, it is indeed a scenic place to be at night. With the lights and ambience, it is rather relaxing to chill over drinks. Totally love the experience and we would visit this place soon.
5
You'll be able to enjoy the beautiful backdrop view of Singapore here without breaking a bank. Great value of champagne by the open area. Sheltered - so you'll still be able to enjoy the night view without getting wet.
5
Lantern in the Fullerton Bay Hotel is a great place to admire the skyline of Singapore and relax. Modern design, beautiful pool, nice coctails and music. Simply perfect! :-) If only the prices for drinks were not so criminal in Singapore!
4
Amazing view of the Marina Bay light show, delicious cocktails and luxe ambiance however I found the drinks service really slow
3
The Lantern is a great place to chill and enjoy the views of Singapore. The drinks were good too and we did have a good time there. Unfortunately the food and service was a bit lacking...we had to repeat our orders many times and the wait staff responses were a tad slow and not very reactive
5
I visited here with my mum following lunch at the brasserie restaurant inside the hotel. The view is beautiful, better than the view from marina bay sands in my opinion and the service and quality of food and drinks is far superior. Cocktails were freshly made and perfectly balanced and the food we ordered later in the evening was delicious. Lobster rolls were perfect. It wasn't as busy as many of the other rooftop bars around the area, surprising given the quality and price. My new favorite bar to take visitors to for sure

Excellent dinner date with my wife in Lantern. The place is very well located, right in front of Marina bay sand. It is open rooftop restaurant. Located in raffles (Fulletron bay hotel). We called and made a reservation on Saturday night. They have limited option of drinks, cocktails, mocktails, coffee etc and just few stuffs to eat. But the ambience , location, view, windy atmosphere and very good service made my dinner date memorable. I really enjoyed my time in Lantern. Check out some pictures i attached. Price of drinks is also not too expensive. If you work in Marina bay financial center you will not feel it expensive as most of the restaurants charge you the same. Overall experience was fantastic and i would really recommend you to visit it

We booked a table here to watch the light show over marina bay Sands. We had read this was the best place to see it from.The bar is a beautiful place to sit and admire the bay, it's a rooftop but not too high so a great place for photos.The cocktails were good I'm a gin and tonic fan but found most bars in singapore haven't quite got into the gin club yet. The food was nice we had the chilli crab sliders, quite small portions but beautifully served.There is a pool on the roof and the hotel guests still use it into the night.I wouldn't recommend it for the light show, there is only one place to see it and that's directly in front of the fountains.However as a second viewing spot it gives a great view of the lasers and a different perspective.A really nice place to chill, listen to great music with fab views

Came here just for drinks last month. The view is breathtaking facing the MBS especially at night with all the lights.
Good selection of drinks, and quite crowded, as it was a long weekend holiday in Singapore
4
Overlooking the water, you can see the entire Singapore coastline, and enjoy the oh so beautiful people.

excellent night view!!! If you want enjoy real Singapore night, need to visit here and have fun.the lantern is quite expensive. but with your girl or boy friend must visit here.정말 멋진 야경을 자랑하는 풀러튼베이호텔 6층에 위치한 루프탑 바 입니다. 마리나베이샌즈 호텔보다 여기서 야경을 즐기는 것이 더 좋습니다. 단 비싼건 어쩔수 없네요
4
Stayed at Fullerton Bay two nights, so few visited to rooftop L to enjoy the sunshine & Bay view, the place & service is good plus nice music & people, but the food quality is "so so" & below the high standard hotel rated, better to visit L only for a drink
4
I was in the bar around 9PM to see the MBS. I heard this is the one of best place to see the scenary. But what I remember was 'it's too hot and humid'. Drinks were nice and cocktail was great. Swimming pool looks gorgeous but you cannot get in if you dont' stay the hotel
5
Always bring 1st time visitors to Singapore to the Lantern to watch the evening laser show and view over Marina Bay by this stunning pool deck bar. Always book a table near the waterfront
5
Wonderful place to relax and see the Singapore skyline. Staff very attentive and helpful. Great view of the Marina Bay Sands lightshow

Went there for a dinner with friends and the view was absolutely fantastic. However, food quality and presentation were not up to my expectations (as always in Singapore high end restaurants).The service was acceptable considering that the waiter forgot to take my orders. I got my food at the same time as others, so +1 for the kitchen staff.Was disappointed with the plastic glasses for the wine and beer. And the music. Do something about that because we had to yell all night to each others because it was so loud! Bottom line: another very expensive restaurant that does not deliver the quality you would expect. My suggestion? Go somewhere else

I'll start by saying that Lantern is one of my favourite places to go in Singapore. However, we had a very poor experience this evening when taking friends visiting from the UK.We arrived to discover it is ladies night. On the bright side, free vodka is on offer for the ladies from 8-9pm which is always a good thing when a house bottle of wine costs in excess of SGD 130. We were having dinner and the menu advised there was 20% off the a la carte food.We stayed all evening so the bill came to in excess of SGD 450 between all of us with the discount taken into consideration.One of our friends paid in cash and we needed the rest split between 3 cards. To our surprise, our waiter advised we would not be able to receive the 20% discount unless we paid on one card. Our view continues to be that this cannot be the first time a group of friends have asked to split the bill between more than one card and this stipulation wasn't explained to us before we ordered. After speaking with the manager who was less than apologetic, we had to cancel the current bill and itemise everything we had to create 3 different bills. The whole payment process took over 30 minutes with no apology or explanation as to why the process had become so difficult other than the system said so.When we expressed our disappointment at the service, the manager tried to suggest we didn't understand because we were from the UK. Myself and one of my friends live in Singapore and so did not appreciate this suggestion that we didn't understand the norms in Singapore as you can imagine.I'll finish by saying that this is my only bad experience in Lantern and I usually find it to be a great place to visit... I'm hoping this will be a one off

The Lantern roof top bar is stunning, beautifully decorated with a laid back funky attitude. Most people seem to gravitate toward the highest roof top bars, like altitude and Ce la vie, although this is not anywhere near as high it is a much better atmosphere and your view is the river and marina bay sands area, beautiful at night! Cocktails are about the same price as the other roof top bars, and are delicious
4
Had a dinner at Lantern restaurant on the terrace, it has some spectacular views of the sea shore, marina bay and the light shows. The food was really good so as the ambiance of the place.
2
I went to the Lantern on the 1st of May to take out my clients who had never been to Singapore. The view and the ambiance of the place is quite amazing. But then the service begins. We had ordered some Badoit Sparkling Water and it never came after only asking for the fifth time the water came. Only today have I checked my bill and they charged me 5x for the Sparkling water after only receiving one bottle. Our food took 2 hours to come out and the waitress who was at the venue had no interest in taking our drinks requests but just walking around pretty.Extremely disappointing service experience guys and to get overcharged after spending $1000+ is not a good night out
4
My husband and I dined at Lantern on the last evening of our honeymoon in Singapore. We had walked through the Fullerton Bay Hotel during the day and had been blown away by the decor and the sophistication of hotel that when we found out there was a bar a restaurant on the roof overlooking the bay we just had to come back. On arrival that evening at the restaurant entrance is when we realised that it really is more of a pool side restaurant than fine dining but please do not let that detract.The restaurant/bar is beautiful and the setting wonderfully chic, it is actually nice to be able to sit outside in and soak up the wonderful evening. The only downside is the plastic glasses, when paying for champagne one would hope to be able to drink from glass. This really was the only slight downside. Whilst the menu is not the largest the food was wonderful and the cocktails and wine also delicious. The views of the Marina Bay Sands (where we were staying) and the light show really are the best of the bay, so for those reasons alone I would most definitely come again. The staff were wonderfully attentive and we were in no way rushed at all, it really was a wonderful evening with wonderful food to match
4
Beautiful roof top bar, with great views of the city and water. The glasses are plastic but this is because there is a pool on the roof i imagine. Service was good, but not fantastic. Prices reasonable for where you are, you are paying more for the views than anything else really. The setting is really pretty lots of fairy lights cover the trees and bushes with vibey music in the background thats not too intrusive. Its great to spend a couple of hours here in the evening if you want something sophisticated and relaxed
1
Booked a table and had great expectations upon arrival after being seated at our table with an amazing view. However, from that point everything went down faster than the lift out of there. Service was extremely slow and staff unattentive. Our entrees were delivered to the wrong table. Long wait for our mains order to be taken. SGD128 for bottle of wine which we had to drink in plastic cups. Over 30min wait for bill. By this time over the view and the place all together.
4
Gorgeous view, especially our group of friends sat through the sunset and enjoyed the light shows at the Marina Bay Sands. Please note though due to the direction of this bar, you'll not be able to see an actual sunset from there. There are sofa seats facing the river directly, and personally I think it's a great place for a romantic occasion.In terms of food and drinks, it's so so and I wish they changed the plastic glasses for the cocktails
1
We reserved one of the best table and the skyline is really beautiful. Good quality food.We've faced problems on orders...we've waited for the staff to place an order for 20 minutes. We've had to get up and call them to place the order. When the order came to our table we've find out glasses were in plastic material...we were very disappointed! No way drinking wine in plastic glasses.Let's talk about the dessert (service). The dessert was served without flat wear...We expected a different service in such a place.
4
you come here for the view, service and prices are as you would expect from such a place, maybe best to come for sun set
2
We visited Lantern for dinner during the restaurant week. The food really disappointed. You could call it bar food at best, which came in tiny portions, not sophisticated at all, neither presentation-wise nor taste-wise. The service, too, was disappointing. First we had to wait for a long time despite having a reservation, then all other tables were served some nuts or appetizers except for ours. Throughout the evening it was hard to get the waiters' attention. Not something you would expect from a place like this. The only positive point really is the view on Marina Bay Sands which is quite nice (one point for that). But there are at least 15 other restaurants/bars with similar views nearby - so do not bother to go to Lantern. We will not be back and definitely cannot recommend
4
We had been told a visit to the Lantern Bar on the Roof of the Fullerton Bay Hotel was a must when visiting Singapore so we put it on our list of things to do.We actually caught the Bumboat from Clarke Quay which dropped us at the Marina Bay wharf and we then walked around 1km to the hotel and made our way up the roof.As you walk from the lift area it is hard not to be impressed with the amazing view and also this beautiful pool and bar area.We sat down on the edge of the balcony but had to move due to the next door tables smoking - bloody awful.Once seated on the next terrace we ordered a pint of Heineken and a captain carribean cocktail and settled back to enjoy the view.We were on our way to Boon Tat hawker market - less than 1km away so opted just for one round.The bill came to $51.80 which is steep for two drinks but you get what you pay for. Interestingly enough those who love champagne might find a bargain here as they had Domaine Chandon sparkling at $24 glass/$118 bottle vs veuve clicquot at $28 glass/$136 a bottle - I know which one I would be choosing.All in all a great experience
5
We spent an evening having a couple of drinks and snacks at this restaurant.It has an excellent view of the bay-front and the open air setting with dim lightning gives a very soothing atmosphere.The food served is excellent and so is the service.A highly recommended place
4
Was here for restaurant week and my girlfriend and I were early, the service staff was very nice by allowing us to bring forward our dinner timing and direct us to the table. The view was wonderful and the atmosphere is windy. The food for the restaurant week was great. However, I feel that the mango salad could more mango cube to make it to have a feel of mango salad. Nonetheless, keep up the good work
1
Very disappointing. I told the lady at the front desk it was my girlfriend's birthday and she was unmoved. So I told my waiter and asked if they could do anything and he walked off. When the table next to us got their desert they had a candle in it. They looked confused as it wasn't their birthday. My girlfriends pasta was crunchy and we told the waiter, he took it away and didn't bring anything back. Then the waiter dropped a tissue in my drink and took it away, he also didn't replace it. As a former waiter I felt sorry for him but it wasn't good food or service.Could do with a few more fans too. Apart from the view it was pretty rubbish
3
Came here on Restaurant Week. The venue is lovely, with a nice rooftop pool overlooking the Fullerton area. For the atmosphere and view alone, I recommend tourists and locals alike to come here for a night.The food however was unremarkable. The gambas and mango salad did not fuse well together and seemed more like separate entities than a dish. The cod sliders were decent, and were served along with yummy truffle fries. However, the meal ended with a very disappointing dessert- the tiramisu was merely cream with a single ladys finger and was on the dry side. I couldn't bring myself to finish it.Food here, even after a discounted price, was not worth it at all. Perhaps it's best to just come here for a drink or two but the food alone won't be able to entice me back
2
Great viewing spot on the Bay. We are on top of Fullerton One hotel. Beverages and food are good and expensive as expected for such a landmark location.But why such a LOUD SOUNDTRACK? This is very annoying. This would deserve to be a much more quiet place. Just another disco with a view. If you're more then 25 years old, just test something else..
2
King prawns are OK though they are not the freshest. But taking 20 minutes to return your bill is not acceptable. Also, this is not a smoke free place.
4
Lantern is on the rooftop of Fullerton Bay Hotel. Went there for drinks with friends as we had a friend visiting (and she found the place!). We were there at sunset and were treated to a beautiful view of Marina Bay, MBS and the Esplanade. There was a good selection of drinks and finger food, at a decent price for a hotel bar in that area. Non-alcoholic drinks were not in the menu but staff were happy to make arrangements for virgin options. Atmosphere was nice and relaxed. We saw a variety of people during the few hours we were there and the staff did not treat anyone differently regardless of what they wore (some looked like they came from a full day of hiking and there were children too). There was live music from 8pm onwards and that got a little too loud for conversations. Nonetheless, this is a place I would be bringing all foreign friends who visit! Reservations may be recommended, especially if you wish to catch the sunset
4
Perfect place for a girls catch up on champagne night. The view is spectacular and the awnings mean it is like that rain, hail or shine. The food was delicious. The duck and pork a stand out. I think this has t be one of my favourite places in Singapore for a treat
4
We had cocktails in the evening with a fantastic view of Maria Sands Bay! We also watched the spectacular light show :) The cocktails are great - bit pricey but worth it
5
I have been in Singapore 8 times, visiting all tourist/expats spots. Nothing can compare to the ambience and the view from Lantern. Forget Marina Bay, it's too crowded, with selfie takers and honestly the view at Marina Bay is way better from the lounge sofas at Lantern, or its pool bed, or from the jacuzzi. Prices for drinks are like everywhere in town, but the service, DJ, design, lights, simply everything about this place will make you come back. While I didn't enjoy bar snacks I loved their Sunday lunch. There is not many places that offer Sunday brunch with 360 degrees view, pool, they even keep array of sun screens if you forget your own. So far - I have been there four days and will be visiting again
5
We had a drink on the terrace. It's a place you cannot miss when you visit Singapore. The music and the view are amazing.
5
I've been here a few times while visiting Singapore for business and pleasure. I love it. The view is exceptional, the feeling spacious and opulent, but the prices are reasonable given all of that. Last night we were drinking Veuve Clicquot for around SG$130 a bottle. It's a bargain in Singapore if you can find it on sale in a wine shop for $70 and it's often more than $200 in restaurants. I've had the signature cocktails before and although they are delicious my personal opinion is that they are not great value for $25 each. But, go for the view, and enjoy for as many hours as your schedule allows
4
We had drinks here last night with friends. The setting is absolutely gorgeous. It was a perfect evening and to see the light show from here was very special. Four stars instead of five because (1) Cocktails were not that exciting and vodka and tonic was mostly ice - given the price this seemed mean and (2) Awful music played MUCH TOO LOUD ! There was no way of turning it down apparently. You do not need loud music up here. This should be a tranquil oasis for friends to chat or simply gaze out at the some of the best views in Singapore. Soft jazz or a gentle soundtrack played quietly would be much more in keeping. The very nice staff offered to move us but because a private event had taken up a lot of the terrace the only available table was in the smoking area so we stayed where we were and struggled to hear each other speak.
5
Staying at the Fullerton Bay Hotel, we were told that the Lantern, their rooftop bar and restaurant, was a perfect place for pre dinner drinks and to see the light show exhibited by the Sands hotel nightly. On a warm evening, the sun set with a romantic glow and the lights of Singapore twinkled on around us. Part of the view is dominated by the three tower Marina Sands hotel and the bay spirals out in front of us. drinks were excellent, lovely and lively music did not drown out conversation. A chic crowd dominated the place and we were blissfully happy to be there
3
Basically you should go hear for the view.The cocktails are also nice.The food menu is limited & the quality average at best.The service varies but overall is average
1
We came here because we have seen a lot of good review and we like the scene. The view, ambient and location is really impress us but the services is actually bad. The waiter and waitress always stand surrounding the bar and I found it very hard to get their attention. We order food but it took us over an hour after round and round of chasing and follow up. They said food were serving to the wrong table. I can understand sometimes this kind of thing can happen. But if I were them knowing this issue I will give special attention to the customer and expedite the food but having said that another half an hour to come. BTW, thanks one of the waiter at the end give us some complimentary drink but it almost too late as our temper gone high already. Just humble suggestion to pay more attention on services then your restaurant will be the best of the best
3
Yes there great views from the poolside bar, but the marina bay walkway is almost as good and free. The food was just ok, prices aren't so great. For good food, you can do better. For a casual place to chill with a couple of cocktails and friends, and an occasional breeze, come on up.
5
Its exclusive, stylish, high end and beautiful. Its a fun place. Best to visit at night with a sky line in view with coloured lights all around. One can also witness the laser show from here.The seating is comfortable and cozy and the drink are made very well. You enjoy each sip. A place to relax with loved ones, friends and family
4
I went there with my wife to celebrate new year together. Initially, I was only there for the view. But the food and service exceeds my expectations, I am a big fan of the cocktail as well. You need to try the Merlion cocktail, and the sirloin steak was delicious. I am already planning my next trip to this place.It might be a bit windy at night, so remember to bring your jacket if you are sensitive towards the strong wind. If you are there to see the laser show from the Marina Bay Sands, do take note of the timing, I believe on Sundays they will start an hour later than weekdays.Overall, a great place to be. A memorable experience for me and my wife
3
Lantern just does not offer enough value for the buck. It's stylish, exclusive, has great vibe, top notch service and offers excellent views - but the food and drinks disappoint. Ofcourse it is pricey considering that it sits atop the Fullerton Bay hotel!It's a great place to hang around, have a few beers and enjoy the excellent views, especially if you are in a group. If you are looking to unwind after a day at work with friends, this should not disappoint. But, somehow it doesn't strike a chord with me - probably because there are a number of better alternatives around, offering much better value for your money.If I were to go enjoy terrace dining with the Marina Bay promenade view, I would probably go to 1 Altitude (or Swissotel) instead
5
We are not bar people but nothing nicer than sitting outdoors with excellent cocktails and music enjoying the Marina Bay view.
4
Had a nice time here and was lucky to go on a clear evening for a beautiful sunset. The drinks were expensive but I suppose that is to be expected at a hotel rooftop bar.
3
Nice food and good drinks. All drinks are served in plastic glasses which was unexpected as we weren't close to the pool. Music too loud given the people seemed to be there to talk (rather than dance)
5
and evening with surprises came here for pre dinner cocktail bartenders here are really good and knowledgeable did really excellent cocktails that surprise me and my wife overall experience was very good
5
great for a late night drinks with colleagues/friends. good food as well as well mixed drinks.
the best timing is during ladies night every wednesday and relaxing through the week blues!
3
Mixed review - the view is stunning, and it is worth it for the view. However, the drinks really disappointed - not up to the mark. The food was also underwhelming. Paid quite a bit for a salad which ended up being quite simple and basic. Service was decent however
4
I went for dinner at this restaurant, the view is good in the evening as you can see the water laser show and lights of Marina Bay from a top angle. Not a place for you to go everyday as the choices of food are very limited but definitely worth going for a special occasion or a place to surprise your loved ones. Pretty hard to go to the toilet at night here as its at the other end and if you are drunk try not to fall into the lovely pool. Please book in advance to avoid disappointment, to commute here its very easy near to raffles mrt station and also lots of cab you can get from the hotel bay or from the other side or the road at collerquay. Co try the mini burgers
5
Recently went to Singapore for my birthday and was looking for somewhere really great to go for my birthday lunch treat. Having done the Sunday brunch at the Ritz Carlton and being disappointed, I decided to go to the Fullerton Bay and seeing it was a glorious day thought it would be nice to go up to the rooftop bar restaurant and have lunch there. Well I was not disappointed. Just the best. The food, menu, service, setting etc was terrific. If you enjoy being outdoors in Singapore then I would highly recommend.So far I had lunch, high tea and dinner at the Fullerton Bay and have never been disappointed. Just love the place
3
The view across to the Marina Bay Sands is fantastic but if you eat and drink their to take in the view be prepared to pay for it. Four skewered prawns $46 and a 500ml draft beer $20. Bottles of ordinary Aussie wine in excess of $100.
3
The only reason why I am giving Lantern a 3* instead of a 4 is because I wasn't entirely blown away by the view. Boohoo.Friends have been raving non-stop about their Truffle Fries and being a huge fan of those fragrant, potato sticks, I finally (yes, finally!) decided to give it a try after a night out at the Asian Civilization Museum. A friend mentioned that without prior reservation, she waited for quite a while being she was seated on a weekend night.I decided to try my luck nonetheless.Upon arriving, we were told towards the bar area to wait for our turn. Somehow or other, I had the impression that if we were hotel guests, we would be given immediate priority. Hmm.. Anyway, we headed to the bar and it seemed like they didn't have a proper system of a queue or 'who comes first'. Everyone was just haphazardly standing around. Being a typical Singaporean who doesn't want to miss out on my turn, I made myself known to the waiter and he just said to wait there. OK, so I spotted some empty tables for two but unfortunately, there were other peeps ahead of us (I had no idea where they came from! Maybe they were lurking around somewhere by the pool). I really wonder how the staff takes note of who comes first.Luckily for us, we waited for around 20 minutes before we were given a table. Yay!Our Order:- Lantern Truffle Fries: Each inch of a fry was meticulously coated with truffle oil. You know how some fries smell deliciously immediately after being served but whittle down to a fragrant-less soggy version after a few minutes? This doesn't. The truffle fries really rock my boat.- Watermelon Juice: Who orders juice at a bar on a Saturday Night? Me of course. I had to be fully alert the next day so I opted for a safer choice instead of my usual IPA. I wasn't disappointed though; the juice was refreshing and absolutely thirst-quenching.- Peppermint Tea: My partner opted for another 'safe' version. (Whatever happen to the good 'ole pairing of fries and beer?!) However, this is really an over-priced version of Twinings Peppermint Tea which you can get for a few bucks per box at any supermarket.What can I say, the truffle fries rock. However, the view was passable to me because of the height of the hotel. Still prefer the stunning view from 1-Altitude
4
This place is really magical. It's on the roof of the Fullerton Bay Hotel and has superb views. Great set up and nice menu with nibbles and drinks. Service was okay but not great since quite slow.
Otherwise I'd recommend this place.
4
Great place for a drink after work. Amazing view over the marina to the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Pricy drinks but happy hour before 6 pm.
4
On the rooftop of the marina bay hotel, great spot at night. A bit odd to see the guests of the hotel bathing in the pool right next to us. Drinks were good though pricey. The truffle french fries great!
5
Had some drinks in the late evening.
Excellent atmosphere; good service; perfect view of Marina Sands Bay.
3
I had a grilled sea bass for dinner and some of my friends ordered the sliders. The food was okay, but for me it was a bit too greasy. However I really enjoyed the view and we had a good time.
3
We went there on Halloween for a drink, after reading all these positiv reviews here. Got a special halloween cocktail that was really good but took it's time. Quite expensive. The View is amazing! Went there in Time for the Sands Lightsshow. Really nice. Because it was so nice we decided to eat something as well. Took a ceasar Salat and the Roquefort Mushroom salat. both very dissapointing. No dressing. Ceasar Salat with anchovies ( ?? ) Mushroom Salat got 3 mushrooms, no dressing. Too expensive for what you get. Took almost 30 minute for the waitress to get it. They forgot the cutlery, had to go to the bar and ask after 10 minutes of wait for a waitress. Beside these problems, they are very pleasing, willing to take pictures of you and your party.
5
This is a gorgeous location for drinks and dinner. Some tips are:- Great cocktails!- Avoid the wine its very expensive (just like most places in Singapore), even the beers are $17.- Order a mixture of dishes and share with your friends. Cheesy Peking Duck Pancakes and Satay dishes are both very nice.- Book early, otherwise you'll end up with at table at the back with the smokers. - Ask your taxi driver to drop you at The Fullerton Bay Hotel entrance, it's spectacular and lovely to walk through to the Lantern.Enjoy the light show and don't fall in the pool
5
Lantern is located on the rooftop of the Fullerton Bay Hotel - a boutique luxury hotel on the Marina Bay. The view of Marina Bay is unbelievable - get a table, sip on a drink, and enjoy the music. The scene and ambiance is great and the place is not overly crowded. Great date spot
4
A thoroughly relaxing time was had while enjoying snacks and a cool cocktail. The view was great, the drinks a bit hit and miss. The service was great, the value a bit hit and miss. The ambience was cool, large pool in the middle, models doing a photo shoot in the corner.I'd go back for sure, it's just not Singapore's best.
5
We went here for dinner and a few drinks one night and we were delighted with our visit. Located on the roof of the Fullerton Bay Hotel next to the lovely swimming pool. Excellent views of the city and a DJ playing some good music. Food and drinks were excellent. Well worth a visit.
4
The food was great however the pork belly didnt quite taste right so we didnt eat it all.... Great view over the bay
5
Gorgeous Views. Stunning ambiance. must visit . its expensive and being served in plastic glasses cheapen the experience. the starters are average and expensive and really small portion sizes. service is sporadic and needs a facelift.
5
Fantastic atmosphere to chill and enjoy the singapore skyline and bay at night. Great service and finger fantastic food. Really relaxing and a great place, albeit pricey to catch up with friends
4
Everything was great (the views of the Marine Bay Hotel, the entire bay, the service, the atmosphere, etc.) Cocktails and music are OK but not amazing.
5
Great drinks and atmosphere, but the best thing about the place is the view of the city. Recommended but you need to it through he hotel.
5
Excellent location; perfect view of Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Marina Bay area. There is a swimming pool where guests of the hotel can use alongside those who come for a drink at the Lantern Rooftop Bar.
5
Such a lovely setting for special drinks. Unforgettable. Makes you want to jump in the infinity pool as soon as you see it. Simply luxurious.
4
We were mesmerise by this restaurant.great view looking at the marina bay hotel. My wife really loved the place very romatnic especially at night. Service was on top! Keep it up! We will come back next year.
5
This is one of the most stunning hotels in Singapore, which holds one of the best bars in terms of style and view of the bay.I absolutely adore the setting downstairs as well as upstairs. It's stylish and sophisticated with a hint of luxury. Absolutely love the pool by the bar. Stunning
5
bar on top of the Fullerton Bay hotel,arrived around 6.30 sh,,got a table,,wife ordered a coffee,me a beer,,enjoyed the fantactic view,of singapore,building works going on,but still great views,,i got by beer quickly wife had to wait a while for her coffee,staff apologized for the wait,and we received a free drinks next round,now thats service had a pizza there,,overall bit expensive,but worth i
3
We had a great Time at Lantern.
We went there at the end of the day and view was amazing!
Mojitos were also excellent.
But.. Pay attention, service is not really good and it's overprice!
3
The view cannot begetter. There is a construction, replacing the roof, in the far end, which is a bummer, but good view. Drinks are so-so. Singapore sling is not what I expected. I should've ordered a beer or wine instead. Finger food is good, except that the waiters do not give you plates, utensils nor napkins. As others mentioned, there's a lot of wait staff, but not very efficient.It's worth a visit, the building is beautiful and the view fantastic!
3
We were slightly reluctant to visit Lantern as some of the Trip Advisor reviews are not wholly compliementary. Currently the view of the Marina Bay Sands area is significantly obscured by building work which is not due for completion for another month. My wife had a glass of wine and I ordered a beer. The wine was served in a plastic wine glass and my beer came in a glass bottle. I had to ask for a glass which when it came, was plastic. The guacamole & salsa dips with corn chips were enjoyable but bizarrely the avocado stone had been left in the guacamole. We are not sure if this is a trademark of the guacamole but we asked for a full bowl without it. We will revisit once the view is restored but would like to think that in a high-end establishment we might enjoy our 'sundowners' in glasses.
3
Absolutely a nice view, but drinks are like anywhere else and the service is really slow. Went there with a group of friends, but sat far from the "view" do try and get a table to the side or close to the edge to enjoy that view. Had a few fingerfoods which was fine and the wine was good. However despiste many wait staff, the service was extremely slow, difficult to get new drinks and it took forever to pay the bill. I would most likely return, if I have visitor in town, but this will not be my favorite hang-out place with friends
2
Reception - warm. Helpful. Drinks - limited selection Service - acceptableAmbiance - sitting under white plastic marque is not classy. Red LED lights under the ceiling does not make a lantern. Drinks - not served on trays. Drinks in plastic glasses. Can't you taste the melamine now ? Visit again ? No.

Went to experience Lantern because of strong recommendations from my expat friends.Made an online reservation which was easy and fuss free.Walking through the opulent lobby of Fullerton Bay hotel to get up to the rooftop bar builds up the anticipation for a great night ahead however my expectation was met with much disappointment upon arrival at Lantern. The lady at the entrance wasn't really warm (no smiles) and we were asked to walk in to the seating area. Upon reaching the seating area, was shown to our seats by the bar manager (again no smiles). We don't really feel welcomed at all.Requested for a change of seats as we were seated too near the speakers and its hard to hold a decent conversation.Request was acknowledged and promised was made, however not delivered. After about 40 minutes later,no one got back to us.We had to ask again about the availability of another seating area. It's ok if they can't accommodate to the request but it is absolutely not acceptable to just forget and not give us an update of any sort.Ordered several food items from the menu. Shortfall in service was made up with the delicious food and the very best Mojito I ever had here in Singapore. Though a little funny as our drinks were served in plastic "glasses".I had observed that if you are an expat or at least expat looking, you get all the attention, however if you are a local, good service was discounted. Extremely disappointed with the staff's attitude. We paid the same prices as the other guests hence we expected to be accorded the same level of service too! Totally unacceptable culture from staff of a 5-star hotel

I simply could not believe it! When you order a GLASS of wine and you're willing to pay $24 for it, the least you expect is that it'll come into a proper glass, not into a totally wet PLASTIC "glass". Especially when you are supposed to be in one of the top places to drink at night in Singapore. And on top of that wine was not even good in the end. Disappointed is not strong enough word in this case.Apart from that, yes, great vista indeed. Congrats for the location, guys

It's a little expensive, but the food was pretty good. All staffs were very kind, well-trained and gave us good services.Above all, I have seen laser show with a bottle of Champagne. It was the most fantastic scene I have ever experienced. I'm sure that the Lantern bar is the perfect spot for enjoying the laser show of MBS

We were looking for a place to relax at the end of a long days sightseeing and I'd read about lantern so thought we'd give it a go... The building, location and ambience was stunning... Yes it is expensive but we expected that and only stayed for a few cocktail (mojito royal, the best mojito I've ever had!!!).. We were made to feel very welcome and the kids were encouraged to watch the light show from the edge...
4
I came here with my colleagues on our final night in Singapore. On the roof of the Fullerton Bay Hotel it has a nice breeze (at least the was when I was there) and is a sensational spot to see the light show on Marina Bay (see photo). While the food was fine the wine pricing was ridiculous. Examples $125 for that Cote du Rhone and $165 for the Cloudy Bay Pinot 2012.Recommended if you eat and watch, but stick to water
5
Best place to have dinner or some drinks with a spectacular panoramic view over the marina bay area. Creative cocktails, very friendly staff.

Firstly, I must make it known that I was there for approximately 45 minutes only, and had one $21 beer. At that price, I would expect to be served well, particularly when the place is pretty much empty (approx. 20 people in the place, including the pool). I must also make it known I've never made a review of anything before but was compelled to do so at this place. My experience: I sat down myself, and waited about 8 minutes before anyone served me. I was at the couch right beside the transparent wall at the pool, about four steps from the bar. So I got up and asked the bartender if I could order a drink. Someone came rushing over and rhymed off a list of beers, I ordered a tiger and a water.So as I sat there enjoying my beer, the view, and the nice atmosphere, I noticed the bartender and server taking sips of mixed drinks, from the straw, and then having the other waitress proceed to give that drink to a customer. I even watched one of them put the straw in the drink, plug the top, as you're supposed to do, and taste it. He then proceeded to put the same straw back in the drink and send that one out too! This happened multiple times and grossed me out. All of this happened whilst I was waiting for someone to either come and ask if I wanted more water, which never happened, or to ask if I needed anything else because my beer was done. No one came to check on me once, so again, I had to stand up and go to the bar and ask if I could pay for the drink. Now, either this is how people are expected to order and pay for premium priced drinks at this place, or the service was terrible, which I definitely think is the case. REGARDLESS, no employee should ever drink from beverages and then serve them. EVER
5
Another nice place to go and just enjoy the view and the ambient. The sofas that are just a little bit below the pool level (and its transparent wall) are the best to set the mood, while the rest of the place is also great. Lighting really sets the tone.I plan on going back to try some actual food.Another great place to take any newcomers to the city
5
This is a popular place to hang out on the weekends and the views across to Marina bay Sands and the light show are fantastic. The cocktails are good and run at the $25 or so mark. The menu is very nice with the mini Wagyu burgers being particularly good! It's outdoors and hot tho there are fans
5
If you like to treat someone for something special in Singapore, this is the place to go. Prior reservation is recommended and then ask to sit right at the river side. The selection of food and wine is excellent and the service is always there when you need them
4
We met up with a group of old friends during our visit to Singapore. We chose this venue for drinks simply because we were staying at the Fullerton Bay hotel, so this was an ideal location for us ( being located on the roof of the hotel) and easy to direct people to.We were very happy with our choice: nice views, prompt and attentive service. Prices no more terrifying than elsewhere in Singapore city centre
3
Came here for cocktails. Lovely views, great range of cocktails, and they were actually pretty yummy. But they serve them to you in plastic glasses, despite the fact you're paying about 25SGD for one. I get it for the people right by the pool, in their swimwear, who order them. But we were not those people. It spoiled a potentially lovely, elegant experience
1
Visited on a Saturday evening with friends. While we made a reservation for a group and were given a Sofa, have to say the view is rather poor. Next to the pool, the sofa only has views of the tents that are there in the terrace, and there is no feeling of being at a height and open space. The best view across on the other side, the Marina Bay – is totally sheltered. We had to get up from our seats and walk over to the over crowded, balcony with our drinks to get a clear glimpse of the beautiful view around. As far as view goes, not the best in Singapore. The second and big issue is the service is one of the worst. When coming to a place like this – I would think one pays for the total experience and service is key. The servers were quite a few but somehow no one seems to be paying attention – to a point that we had to ourselves get up and go to the service station to ‘request’ someone to come and take our order!!!We ordered some white and red wine by the glass – and this was amazing. Even the Red Wine (Which should be served at room temperature) was as chilled as the white and was served in a frosted glass. Icing on the cake – the wine was served in plastic glasses!!!! Overall – over hyped placed, very touristy and to be avoided. Hop next door to the One Fullerton for much better places , great views, good service, better prices and overall experience. The One Fullerton has a number of places which have Happy Hour in the evenings and my personal recommendation would be The Overeasy

Just check out my pictures...ARRIVAL: you need to book days in advance and they will hold your booking and protect those tables for you. But all 4 visits in last 4 weeks were Walk-ins for me. And after little standing and enquiry here or there, we always got a table. Just need to connect with the host or hostess and magic happens. Even with bookings people come and leave fast so tables turn nicely. By the way the Fullerton Bay hotel is grand in its own right. So enjoy the walk in experience. FOOD: ordered satays, cod fish sliders, the wings and wings again. Just tasty easy finger foods. The cod sliders are in black mini buns. I mean it's black. Very unusual but very edible. COCKTAILS: well priced for location. But do not expect budget prices like Clarke Quay. If you come here you come to pay the price to enjoy a wonderful experience of tasty cocktails. They make non alcoholic versions of most cocktails. Amazing reward to non drinkers who can be left out. Prices without alcohol are attractive. AMBIENCE: seating is spaced out. Under tent for good reason to protect again wind and rain and dust settling. Cushions to sit on and lean against. Take a walk around and get some lovely pics even if you not a tourist. If you there during lights show the place is awesome. Seating on sides are outside under umbrellas some next to pool side with infinity flows. Just beautiful. This place is priceless. Music is excellent. The DJ selections lifted the experience. SERVICE: on the better side compared to Singapore in general. I've learned not to worry about service in SG anymore. Just take it as it comes. So here the service in my view is therefore good. Overall this place is great and grander than I expected. I would prefer it over kudeta because of the reliable cocktails. Don't forget to check out my pictures.

I have been to all of the hip and happening bars in Singapore as far as I can tell, and being based in Melbourne (Australia) I've admittedly become a tad fussy about bars (and I will rave about great ones when I experience them). We would have given The Lantern five stars, because the location, view, music, setting and general vibe were all fantastic. However, the drinks are not great value. For example, there are a number of Champagnes and sparkling wines the same as the Kinki restaurant next door but more than 25% more expensive (and they are not great value at Kinki in the first place). We had the house-made Negroni, at about $33 per drink including service charge. If it blew our mind we would have worn it as a top quality drink at an amazing place. But, it was quite weak and had no 'wow' factor. Next time we will go back for a simple late-night whiskey or G&T at around half the price.

Great location. One of the best views of Singapore. We had cocktails. I had a vodka martini however, my glass wasnt full! I had to request it be filled!
2
Went with my husband around 2 pm on a Saturday... Not at all crowded. Great view, but terrible service's we asked for tap water and ordered two cocktails. However, we received and were charged for two bottled water... Though others had tap water on the table. Only one cocktail came, though the bartender was not busy, and when we asked after 15 minutes for the second drink it was never entered into the order system by the server. Salad was good but the service was so poor that we will not be back

One of my favourite rooftop bars in Singapore. The Cocktails were delicious with a great variety. They currently have some Christmas specials on offer. They also have local specialties available all year round. The Christmas Blossom and Hibiscus Royale Sling are a must try. The most appealing aspect is the view of Marina Bay Sands. Also compared to other bars it is reasonably quiet and the relaxed ambiance makes it ideal to have a conversation with friends without having to shout over music as I have experienced commonly in other bars
4
Lantern's location is great, being a rooftop bar that too one overlooking the river - it's usually breezy and the soft lighting really helps create an atmosphere. We were here for drinks and a light supper. I had the Hibiscus Sling - a delectable combination of gin, Cherry Liquor, Hibiscus, and a few other fancy shmancy things, and the Raspberry Blast - a rum based cocktail muddled with fresh raspberries that resulted in an overwhelming flavour burst the minute it touches the tongue! The husband nursed a Glenlivet and an Asahi, which couldn't go wrong. We shared a plate of Truffle Fries (which came with Ketchup and Truffle Mayo) and Corn Chips (that came with Guacamole & a Fiery Salsa), both of which were up to the mark. They do have a few vegetarian options, more than a lot of other places have, yet, it felt like they there could be more variety in there that was truly vegetarian and not just meat substitutes. However, it's a really nice place to unwind and relax. The cocktails are truly terrific
4
We took some cocktails at the rooftop bar just after some (very) long flying hours, it's quite a relaxing place, with a view on the Marina Bay. We also took some satays which were quite good.I recommend going at 8 PM when the show from the Marina Bay Sands starts, you'll have a perfect view.The service was a bit long, but everyone was kind and helpful. The prices are quite high, but that's a chic place so..
4
Spent our last night here, arrived at 9.20pm was seated straight away, and drinks were served timely. Very nice location to sit and relax and enjoy a warm Singapore night.I agree the prices are high ( but most places like this are in Singapore ) deal with it Singapore is not a back packers location, spend your money any enjoy the experience. We thought it was better than both Raffles and The Marina bay sands, both you should do and make your own mind up at what you most enjoyed

I was there last Friday. I live in San Francisco and came back home for a couple of weeks. I took out my wife and my brothers for drinks and appetizers here. We came in at about 830. First we saw tons of open tables with 'reserved' signs on them. We were told we would take 20 mins to be seated. After 20 minutes, we asked the waitress for an update and she unhelpfully suggested another 15 mins. Meanwhile our legs ached so we just sat down at a table next to us. Within a couple of minutes, the now very responsive waitress re-appeared and told us to go back to standing. At this point, we ordered a $100 bottle of Burgundy. Quite simply, it was one of the worst bottles of wine i have ever tasted. I have had $10 bottles from Costco that have tasted way way better. To think that this establishment can serve such terrible wine at a $100 price tag is beyond reason. And to cap it off, we were given plastic wine glasses?!?We were finally seated but right next to the blaring speakers. We barely talked the whole night. Meanwhile, i noticed that the 'reserved' tables were still empty. A truly world class establishment would never let this happen. And i frequent plenty of amazing restaurants here in SF with Michelin stars. The wait staff have less attitude and more of a desire to please.The only star is for the food. The satay and wings were quite good. IF i were management, i would switch out the wait staff and hire a few classy individuals. Could make the difference between a failing bar and a solidly successful one. You guys choose what you want

Perched on the roof of the Fullerton Hotel (the magnificent former Post Office building) at the mouth of the Singapore River, the Lighthouse Bar is a perfect place to take in the river, the bay and the heart of the colonial district. It's a relaxed, intimate setting with pleasant service ... and the place I heard about TWO WONDERFUL WAYS TO EXPLORE THE CITY:I told our friendly waiter that I'm an architect looking for a good way to see Singapore's vast system of housing estates, where most of its people live. He suggested riding around on the fabulous system of buses or the MRT, which runs above-ground over most of the island. It was a great idea, cheap and easy, and gave us a wonderful window into life in Singapore
3
Came here to have lunch. The view was great but that's where it finished. The service felt like we were interrupting something and our meal and beers bill was as high as the Marina Bay Sands. Apart from the view we found better more welcoming places to eat
4
Imagine a stunning tent filled with lights, next to a perfectly lit pool at night and one of the best views in the world...well that is Lantern. The drinks are amazing, with dozens of craft cocktails with unique ingredients and requiring superb bartending/mixing. The price is definitely reflective both of the high priced Singapore nightlife and the view but it is worth it for one drink. Make a reservation ahead of time if you want to be guaranteed a nice table with a view as it was quite busy on the weekend
5
This is a very good place to relax around the Bay area. The views are phenomenal. The drinks are fantastic with a good selection. Lots of expats. Service is also quite good.
4
Great view but drinksare a little pricey,.
There is a happy hour so make sure you time your visit. I recommend at least 1 drink here, as it is a lovely vista from the roof of the Fullerton Bay.
4
Great view of the bay snack food tasted great! The service was excellent! Slightly on the expensive side however worth it for a couple drinks to check out the bay and the lighting from Maria sands.
4
We came here at night time. We sat outside and order two drinks. The atmosphere was serene. Great place to talk and just chill. Service can improve. It was busy and under staff. Recommend taking a walk by the bay and a visit to the main lobby. Beautiful.
4
It is located at The Fullerton Bay Hotel roof top, directly opposite Marina Bay Sand; it is among the top location in town to have a nice video over the water with MBS skyline. It serves Western Food that is light to go with drinks. Good place for a small group gathering since it is open air and hearty laughters is of less a concern to the next table
4
If you want a beautiful view with great service, this is one of the best places I've found in Singapore. It is a little pricey, esp. the drinks. Since I'm sure I'll never spend the money to stay in this lovely hotel, it was a nice way to enjoy the luxury
4
I hope I have the right bar as the view was spectacular. To start with the staff were not very friendly and told us there was no room upstairs then suddenly changed their minds and we were able to get a seat. Be careful if you are near the infinity pool as I came away soaking wet but luckily was able to get the stains out my clothes. The prices are way over the top but guess you're paying for the view. An interesting evening but wouldn't rush back there

We were guests at the Fullerton Hotel which is a sister hotel of The Fullerton Bay. We rang for a reservation as suggested and were told that it was very busy and would have to just try walking in. We did that later on in the evening walked straight past The Greeter to check out if they had room ! Several tables were available one being right at the front facing the Marina Bay Sands so we just sat down and waited for someone to take our order. On checking out the menu we realised it was going to be expensive. Corona $19.00 soft drinks $10.00 - $15.00 cocktails all over $30.00 + taxes. Due to the expense you would expect a few more nibbles but you only get one small bowl of nuts.Good atmosphere due to DJ, great views but spoilt by the fact you have to watch what you are spending
1
From the moment you arrive at the reception and are greeted by an uninterested Greeter, with the phrase "we're very busy, you're going to have to stand at the bar", as you then walk past rows of empty tables - you know it's going to be a bad experience. OK, the view of the bay is great and the Barmen friendly, but that's all that is positive. We ordered a gin and tonic and a Negroni. "A large one" the Barman said. You'd expect this as standard from a luxury hotel, so I said yes. We then were presented with two plastic beakers of drinks. After a few minutes, the disinterested hostess returned and said that they could give us a table. We were escorted, but left aside a table and chairs. I had asked the Friendly Barman to make a couple more drinks. After what seemed ages, I had to chase someone to bring the drinks over. We were then presented with a small bowl of nuts and left to fend for ourselves. When we chose to leave and eventually found someone to ask for the bill, they then disappeared. After a long wait, I went up to the counter to try and settle the check. The disinterested Hostess then presented a bill of $168 for 4 drinks (yes - you read that correctly). I work in luxury hospitality and travel the world. This is daylight robbery and poor, complacent service of the higher degree. I hope the Owners and Managers of the Fullerton Bay Hotel hang their heads in shame
4
It worth an experience. Fullerton Bay Hotel itself is a beautiful hotel.At the Lantern, you can sit and enjoy the view of the Bay. Sunset and evening time are most romantic. DJ need to improve the repertoire of the songs.Beware and expect a pretty big check upon leaving because first of all, alcohol tax in Singapore is high and in addition to that, Lantern is in a Fullerton Hotel's price. You want the same view but cheaper, go next door to Kinkys. But you won't have the same exclusivity as you will get at the Lantern. Suggestion is to always go for a bottle instead buying drinks by glasses and more glasses. In the end, you will eventually save more money with purchasing bottle :)So many other places in Singapore for you to experience and Lantern is one of the must go at least once with your friends. They have smoking section too by the way, on the far left of the place
4
Pricey but with a picture perfect view, this is the place to impress your out of town guests with a pre-dinner drink. You'll have front row seats for the light show if you sit on the lower deck.
4
Really relaxed and chilled out, staff are friendly and discreet. Service could be slow, but the vibe was laid back, so it didn't impact on experience too much and they were very attentive when they appeared. Pretty views out over the bay. Food was good, we had a selection of starters to pick and share (satay, mini wagyu sliders, duck nori) and there is a good selection of wines (Just a shame it's served in thick plastic glasses!) It is expensive - we spent $350, but thats average for Singapore!
4
Great spot with fabulous views over Marina Bay and for the light show at the Marina Bay Sands. Yes, it is expensive, but you don't get to sit in these surroundings with these views without paying a bit over the odds and, compared to some places in Singapore, the prices weren't that bad. What was bad was some of the other guests who certainly had more money than class. Overall a pleasant experience if you can ignore your neighbours..
3
We went there in the evening for a drink and to admire the Singapore skyline. Views from this rooftop bar are breathtaking with an unobstructed view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel & casino. There is a large tent or gazebo that covers most of the patio which seems a bit unnecessary on a clear night. We had a seat at the edge facing the harbour and, while it didn't mar our view, it would have given us a more Al Fresco experience by not having something above us.Drink prices are very expensive, even for Singapore standards, and they are served in plastic glasses, which is unfortunate. That being said I thought it was worth it to come for one drink and watch the Marina Bay Sands light show
1
the lantern seems to be 'the place to be in SIN', but after having experienced the 3rd time in a row disappointing service, I will not go there again apart from showing the view to visitors. everybody knows it is pricy - again because of the view and certainly not because of class, service or quality. it is however amazing that this bad management is accepted from an investor. nope, not again for me - there is plenty better choice in beautiful Singapore
1
I don't mind paying a high price but it's gotta be worth it... That's what they didnt get at the lantern. Poor welcome upon arrival, hostess makes us feel like she's doing us a favor by letting us in. Long wait before ordering and another long wait before getting our drinks... In plastic glasses... Beautiful view indeed but attitude of staff ruined it all. Next time we'll go back to raffles for drinks at least they'll make us feel welcome
5
Love this place. Yes it's warm, but position yourself under a fan & soak up those views. Good vibe, attentive service, delish nibbles. It's hotel drinks prices, but I think good service & views are worth it.Great place for a relaxed drink a deux, or for a group gathering
4
Reservation is reccomended. I gotten a non-smoking table with a pretty good view, facing the river and MBS. the atmosphere was great and food is decent. Slightly on the pricey side but thats to expect from a Hotel bar. Must try their mini burgers and salmon pizza
1
The place has an amazing view of Marina Bay but they have a huge ugly tent covering the terrace blocking most of the view. We had booked in advance and they put us in the middle of the big tent where there is almost no view at all. We asked if we could have a table outside the tent where there were several available, or at least on the edge of the terrace but we were told they were all reserved. We then asked if we could have a drink before dinner at the lounge next to the pool and were also told it was reserved even though there was lots of space available. We were just trying to get a bit of time outside the stupid tent but the staff were unapologetic and not interested in helping us at all. We could see that there were several lounge areas all around the pool where they could easily have put us for a quick drink but they clearly didn't want to make an effort. We finally left and went down to eat at collyer quay.Lantern is an expensive place and we are willing to pay for a great view and friendly service, but it would surely not have been worth it stuck inside a stuffy tent with staff who are indifferent to your requests. Disappointed
4
Been here for drinks with other friends, assume people residing at fulleton hotel dont require booking but for general visit people should do prior booking for place, just ordered few drinks and spend the night at this place, nice music not over priced decent prices for the location beautiful view of marina bay sands and other cbd of singapore. Would definitely recommend this place
4
Went for 1 drink. Cocktails are ok and price wise similar to most higher end bars in sg e.g 23-29 sgd per cocktail. You would go there for a view and see through glass pool from the front!
3
Went to the Lantern in the evening. The Atmosphere was great especially with the Marina bay Sands light show in full swing. The truth is you go there for the view, night time is best, definitely not for the food or drinks. While the prices were on a par with similar venues the cocktails seemed to be missing one important ingredient, alcohol. either that or there was very little in the cocktail. Whatever, they were distinctly weak and not all that good. Another niggle is the wait staff kept whisking our glasses away before we had a chance to empty them. And I don't like the plastic glasses either but I think the reason for those is the close proximity to the swimming pool. Go there by all means but do so more for the view than what's on offer
4
In Singapore, one of the fun is to find a good location with drinks (or good diner) with a view on the bay.....The lantern is a good choice.Not too high but extremely good located, the view is large on the bay and the marina bay sand. the cocktails are inventive and tasty. The drink list is long and long.....You are welcomed but the seats are difficult to obtain without no reservation. In totally, if you are the trendy crowd (typical from SIN), and the good drinks and finally a nice view and unobstructed from the terrace,....go go g
2
We went here last Thursday for a drink. Nice ambiance, attentive staff. The drinks are quite expensive, about SGD 20 for the cheapest white wine. But this is Singapore so I am not surprised. However, the wine comes in a plastic glass?! That really spoils it! So, unfortunately won't return to this rooftop bar. A much better option is LeVel 33: great views, they brew the beers themselves, affordable prices and....drinking from a real glass!!
2
Been here a couple of times because the view is simply amazing and it's also a nice place to have a quiet evening. Unfortunately, the last trip was very disappointing because we were faced with a very rude door hostess, Michelle, who was the least approachable (the irony). To cut the long story short, she found it extremely difficult to answer our questions directly, instead, she passed the messages via her colleague (he was very helpful and friendly), who was just standing next to us and we could hear every single word she said. No smiles, no eye contact, nothing, coming from a door hostess, the first face every guest sees when they enter the bar. Anyway, we were told that we could/should write in a feedback to Lantern which I did, but guess what, it's been a week and there's no response from their end at all. I guess, lousy management breeds lousy staff
3
I visited the Lantern Bar to see the laser display over Marina Bay. The bar has stunning views over the Marina Bay area. However, prices are sky-high!! Cocktails were $24 plus tax, bottle of beer $17 plus tax and snacking options were equally expensive.I would choose another vantage point next time
4
Our friends who live in Singapore kindly took us to experience this roof top bar above a hotel which has significant class and style. The bar was busy at around 8pm and it was uncanny when dressed for dinner to be amongst some bathers dressed in their robes. It did not detract from a unique experience though, in my view it was a little pricey but that is not unusual in such a place
2
Maybe it was not the right night, but we did not find the barman or the waiters at their best during our visit to the Fullerton's Roof Top Bar. They simply disappeared for long intervals.The way to get there is by itself a challenge, having to change lifts and find the small one (with its stop at the toilet mezzanine) to get to the restaurant and then up the stairs to the bar. The view is great if just you do not look at the dusty and faltering curtains. The drinks we had were watered down by so much ice it was impossible to taste them. Obvioulsy the price tag was extortionate.Not a good experience at all
3
This place is on a terrace of the very nice Fulerton Bay hotel on the Marina Bay.It has a very nice view of the bay, but when I went there, there was a tent at the very edge of the terrace which was actually hiding all the view!So if you wanted to enjoy the scenery of the Marina Bay Sands, you had to squeeze to the left side of the terrace...I had a vodka coctail with ginger, which was average..
4
You are definitely paying for the view and location as this bar is extremely expensive, especially for what you get. Happy Hour is the only time you should come (standard drinks, beer and wine for SG$14), which is before 7.30 pm.The view is the best part about this restaurant as you look in amazement at the harbor and Marina Bay Sands.Service is friendly but slow. If you are in a hurry to get your drinks and food, you will be disappointed. I wouldn't go back to this...once was enough. I'm sure you can get this view from another (higher) vantage point for way cheaper
4
Such a great location on the rooftop! Average drinks, the fresh tortilla chips were fabulous but guacamole and salsa were sad. Wish they had more than snacks.
4
Very elegant tent structure venue by the Fullerton Bay rooftop pool with views over Marina Bay. Great place to meet friends and have drink and snack. Super views and friendly staff.
5
We had lunch the mini burgers, calamari and satay were well presented and tasted amazing. The view is quite spectacular, staff were a little distracted but that was the only downside.
If you get a chance check out the hotel foyer, breathtaking
4
Excellent place to have sun downers and a small bite to eat in Singapore. The light show across the Marina is well worth a look.
5
The location is fantastic and you can sit there all evening gazing at the view. cocktail menu is great and service is excellent.
2
We went to Lantern on a Sunday evening to watch the sun go down, have a little champagne and some dinner. We had one bottle of champagne, 3 tiny mini burgers and fries, 4 scallops, two slices of buffalo mozzarella/a couple of cherry tomatoes and the bill was around $350.00.We had instructed the staff that we wished to pour our own champagne, but every 5 minutes they were trying to top it up. We like to drink at our pace, not hotel wait staff pace.Strangely every time we tried to order food the wait staff were nowhere to be seen.When the food was delivered it was just plonked on the table without it being arranged nicely in front of us. When I am paying a fortune for my food I do anticipate that the service will be a little more specialised.There were not many people dining that night, so it seemed that the hotel had got a handyman in to fix up some of the lights and other bits. Scared to order any more, we left after attempting to pay for the bill for quite some time. Eventually we moved over to the pay station and found our bill had been printed but no one could be bothered to bring it over.Hotels like this charge a lot of money because rich guests stay, pay and claim. They dont expect repeat business and they are not going to be disappointed - as locals we wont be back

We had organised and booked and reserved a group evening on a Wednesday ladies night, about 25 woman attended, except due to the rain, we were not allowed to go into the elevator to the rooftop, the hotel did not offer an alternative.After 30 mins arguing, they eventually accommodated us on the rooftop with umbrellas, where we were given very slow service and were dripping wet, while there was an event on under an awning which we would clearly be unwelcome.With hindsight, they should have asked us to go to another of the hotels bars, but Never again
5
We headed here for a celebration and enjoyed a great evening watching the light show with a glass of champagne. Try to get a table at the front to overlook the bay. Impeccable service didn't need to ask for anything. Would be the perfect place to spend an afternoon/evening but the light show view from here was great would go again

Great view, stunning atmosphere, fun lazier shows, fabulously dressed people, good music.terrible cocktails.Please. I know they can put a little more money on drinks expenses.Right next to the horrible cocktails in MBS swimming pool, this place tops second in serving the worst cocktail in Singapore.. Yuck..

Situated on the roof of the Fullerton Bay Hotel is the very elegant Lanterns. Lanterns has a prime location on Collyer Quay and has stunning views of the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel(the 3 towers with a boat on top).Lanterns has a pool which is the first thing you see when you get out of the lift, around the pool are numerous chill out areas. Once past the pool you come to the main bar/restaurant itself with the stunning views. Lanterns has seating areas to eat as well as further seating and chill out areas.Excellent array of cocktails as well as good food. Sometimes the bar/restaurant area can get very busy and service suffers. However, for the majority of the time service was good. The bar area has an eclectic mix of customers, trendy locals, working expats and up-market tourists
4
Great atmospjere. Very relaxed. good bar food and cocktails. The night view of the light show id fantastic.
5
The bar on top of the Fullerton Bay is quite simply the perfect stop for a drink on your first night in Singapore. The perfect view overlooks what feels like the entirety of Singapore and although it's expensive, where isn't in Singers! Treat yourself...
5
Probably well known in S'pore as one of the best bars/restaurants in town to have a superb view of the Marina Bay Sands complex at night. Recommendable to book in advance. Lychee mojito was nice, and the food is Ok. Around 40 to 50 EUR per person for a few snacks and a couple of drinks. Pricey but normal standard for Singapore.Totally recommendable to visit during the light night show of the MBS around 7-8ish pm
5
Situated on the top of The Fullerton Bay Hotel with overlooking of MBS while having the late night drink is impeccable, wish I couldve asked for the edge spot next time to express my night from the different angle. The service is another highlight of the reason ill determine to come back again. Great ambiance, stunning light show, and savory dishes. What else are you asking for 
5
We dined at Lantern after a terrible experience at Ku De ta and absolutely loved it!We had a booking and were seated on the edge just in time for the light show. The service was fast and prompt and the food was lovely. The calamari was one of the best I have ever had. Was a great way to finish a holiday in the area. We will be back
5
A beautiful location and setting for a special dinner. The staff were very attentive, the meal was lovely but the setting of the restaurant around a rooftop swimming pool and the view across all of Singapore (including the Marina Bay Sands building) made the entire package well worth it. Must book a table beforehand
2
Went with some colleagues. The place is nice and has great views, but the hostess refused to seat us! Not sure why, but we stood at the bar for a quite a while, when there were tables available. The views are good, the drinks are expensive. Don't come here unless you want the staff to be rude to you, while you pay for over priced drinks. The only reason I am not giving it a one, and have given it a two, is that the views really are lovely
5
We booked a table for six persons to enjoy the views over Marina Bay, Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the light show display that was on in the harbour. The food was good although a little pricey, as were the drinks and the service, but the location and ambience of the place was what really makes it worth a visit
4
Only five floors above the ground, but a superb view looking out across Marina bay to the shipping lane beyond. A perfect spot to sit and have a drink as dusk turns to night and the city lights up. The drinks are about average by Singapore fancy hotel standards, both in terms of price and quality. Moderately expensive and and moderately good (stick to beer or wine, don't bother with the cocktails).Service was pretty perfunctory and disinterested. The menu talked up a big game on the cocktails, but what arrived was pretty lacklustre, over-sweet and in one case just plain not what the menu described (presented with the correct name, but clearly not the listed ingredients). Go for the view, stay for a drink, and then move on.Pricey bar snacks didn't entice much interest, but we did try a round of duck spring rolls which I thought were quite tasty but my wife was less taken with them. They were definitely too expensive
4
This is a great way to start your night out - or finish it off. Views over the bay are stunning- as are cocktail prices, but the cocktails are good quality. Beer nibbles are provided and refreshed- I think if it looks like you will order a 2nd drink :}Get there early to watch sunset, but has a queue on weekends and Fri night
4
This is definitely worth spending some time here. The cocktail was lovely and the food ok. My favourite place for bar food and cocktails is still Cut.
3
Breath taking view from drinking at Lantern but too pricy for drinks...would be a perfect place for dining as couple.
1
The location is perfect but we really wonder who decided to put a tent over the tables! It's hot and the view is hidden. Hope they will take it out soon...
5
This is a great place for a nice, relaxed drink by the pool...the hotel has breathtaking decor and the rooftop bar has easily the best view in Singapore..you can take in the daily laser light show put on by the Marina Bay Sands across the bay while sipping your favourite poison. The plastic glasses are a surprise,but do not seem to have an impact on taste, and are a pretty good imitation of the real thing. Cheap it is not, but location is everything. The bar is nice size too, not overwhelming and manages to be spacious but intimate. Plenty of cover for the frequent rain showers.The transparent swimming pool is quite entertaining- you can see folk swim around as if in an aquarium while you kick back
1
Went to the Lantern as a farewell to Singapore with girlfriends. Had thought to book a table, which I would highly recommend, as the bar is very busy. The logic was that this would have a great view albeit with a price tag to match.Well - there is a huge awning covering the whole seating area. Regardless of where you are sat, there is little view to be had.Secondly, this is the only place in Singapore where adults are served their drinks in plastic glass. OK, it is by the hotel's pool but at night time you're hardly likely to be taking a dip and running the risk of dropping your glass. Strangely, beer is served in bottles ... doesn't add up and on its own ruined the whole vibe of the place.Thirdly the food; if you order the hummus beware, its mainly pitta bread with a small serving of actual hummus. Really, just an appetiser for one person (and not to share as our waitress indicated). Overall the food was mediocre and as for the prices, that's another matter.Lastly, we knew that this would be more than your average price. But wine by the glass started at something like SG$20. Food was over priced for what it was.To be honest, if you want a drink go to Level33. If you want to eat go to The Lighthouse at The Fullerton
1
The Fullerton brand in Singapore is synonymous with quality and class. So how disappointing it was to have had such a poor experience at this bar. Location wise it can not be faulted. The service was pretty good. The prices were outrageous - but they go with the territory. What really let the whole experience down was being served wine in plastic glasses - the kind you might use when out on a picnic. For a far superior experience visit the Lighthouse restaurant atop the Fullerton Hotel or any one of the roof top bars scattered around the CBD area

It took us a third tryst before Sharona* and I finally managed to chill out at Lantern Bar @ Fullerton Bay Hotel. The first time, it was raining so we drank somewhere sheltered; the second time, there was a private event so we could not enter. Finally, we managed to chill out at this lovely rooftop cum poolside bar located at 80 Collyer Quay, Fullerton Bay Hotel Rooftop Level, Singapore 049326 and the number to dial is 6333 8388."Lantern" derives its name from Clifford Pier's historical name of "Red Lantern Pier" a landing point for Singapore's first immigrants and red lanterns were hung from the pier as a guide to seafarers. Today, it is a stylish, sultry rooftop / poolside bar offering paronomic, picturesque views of the cityscape, and ejecting sensual vibes of class and utopian ambience.We decided to sit under the tent-like, covered section in lieu of the more romantic pool seats. It was Ladies' Night on Wednesday, unbeknownst to us, so the crowds started to fill in shortly. Ladies get free flow of vodkas. The night started to darken so the gorgeous lights over at Marina Bay Sands areas, and its vicinity, began to take the night by storm.Sharona* and I orderd a Pizza with Mozarella, Sausages and Onion Jam to accompany our wines and vodka indulgences. The interestingly-shaped pizza was served on a rectangular wooden board. The crust was thin and while not crispy, was almost flakey enough to nibble on. It was delicious, especially with the succulent sausage slices and strong flavor of onion jam.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/chilling-out-at-lantern-bar-fullerton.htm

Great location (rooftop of the beautiful Fullerton Bay Hotel). Cheerful service (make sure you book a table!) Trendy and easy music. The crowd is always pleasant. Don't forget to order truffle fries and eat the wagyu beef burgers as soon as they are served (they get cold easily!) Smart deals on bottles (my friends and I always get champagne), when compared to mixed drinks
5
Really loved this bar, it has a real chilled out vibe, good music (a little loud), wonderful views of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the fabulous light show at 11pm. The bar is on the roof of the gorgeous Fullarton Bay Hotel where you you will also find the stunning pool. We found the staff to be really pleasant and attentive. We treated ourselves to a bottle of champagne which worked out at about £80, given that drinks in Singapore are expensive at around £9 for a G&T we thought the price for champagne was pretty good. Definitely recommend it and will go back when in Singapore

Beautiful women do not need to work and that everything will be catered to them. A Ferrari is not the most reliable car but it is still highly sought after. Taller and more attractive people on average earn more wages that ordinary people. That's just the way the world works. Don't come to the Lantern expecting it's beautiful Korean waitresses to bend over backward to get you and your friends a table. Nor should you expect them to notice that your beer is almost finished or that you're waving your arms or jumping up and down for their attention. This is not a sports bar. Enjoy it's spectacular view and order a bottle Champagne. Be elegant and have class. Be beautiful. Be as beautiful as this place and maybe, just maybe, you'll be noticed
4
The lantern is a really nice place to have a drink.
Good cockails and you can enjoy a beautiful view on the bay. Service is good.
I enjoyed my time at the lantern.
3
Although not the highest building, the view from this rooftop bar is excellent. The drinks are as you would expect, good. When we were here the dj only played terrible music and far to loud to have a normal conversation......
4
nice and comfortable environment for an after dinner chat with friends
large choice of long drinks
a bit expensive but quite reasonable as compared to old Europe and USA standards!
4
....you will feel like you have the City at your fingertips...the vista is breathtaking...I was taken there on my first night in Asia and what a great introduction to this vibrant place....excellent drinks, great nibbles (we had just appetizers before dinner)....an eclectic crowd....enjoyed it!
4
It's the view what makes this place fantastic. Great view over Marina bay, and with a very nice view over the Marina Bay sands iconic hotel. Great for drinks, food not that special, but expensive.
1
We went to this place twice in one week. Service is poor, very poor and the food offered on the menu is not at the level you would expect from a 5-star hotel. The Caesar salad was so bad we could not eat it. Who can miss a Caesar salad
5
Rooftop terrace bar at the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Overlooks Marina Bay with amazing views of the Marina Bay Sands. The ambience was excellent with lit up trees, pools and the night sky above. We asked to be seated outside the canopy. The drinks were unique - the server suggested Singapore Sling, even though it was not on the menu - it was very good. The beef carpaccio was very good. The lamb chops were tender. We also tried the Chorizo pizza. The server brought the wrong food first, but promptly corrected his mistake. Highly recommended for special occasions. Quite expensive although standard for a high quality restaurant in Singapore
4
This is the first place my friends took me when I arrived in Singapore. As others have said, the views of the marina and the city are simply amazing. I highly recommend that you hit this spot while you are in Singapore. Grab a cocktail, or two, take some pics, and then head on out to the surrounding area to take in all the sights. Definitely worth the visit
5
We dropped in here for cocktails on a recommendation and as a happy coincidene it was happy hour!! I cant remember the names of the cocktails we had but they were lovely = mine was served on its own tray = my husband said his G and T was excellent too. Surroundings were just 5*. The only drawback was the waitress didnt speak much English and communication was rather difficult
4
We we're recommended this place by someone we met in a taxi line in Singapore. Upon arriving to the hotel, was blown away, was wondering why we hadn't picked this hotel to stay in. Got to the bar which has amazing views, but found the customer service to be somewhat mediocre and on the verge of rude. Food wasn't anything exciting, and wished we had eaten somewhere else. Would only recommend this place for a drink.
4
Great place for a drink with nice views and atmosphere. Perfect for watching the light show that Marina Bay Sands puts on (and for people watching). Drinks are expensive, but it's worth checking out.
5
Fantastic views. This is the place to have cocktails and a fantastic view of the Marina Bay and the famous landmarks at MBS.
4
Lovely surprise .... Rooftop terrace, open air, with great ambience and views. Good dance music, tho they shd hire us full time to get up and dance .... Maybe Singaporeans Don,t recognize a good thing when it, put on their plate!

Nice view, great ambiance. Good food and beverage selection. Most impressive was the terrific service!

I booked a table for four a week in advance before heading down to Lantern on a Saturday night. On the day itself, I learnt that another friend was coming and called Lantern to add another person, simultaneously requesting for a seat with a better view as we were celebrating my friend's birthday. The lady who took my call sounded disinterested and told me they couldn't get us another table but could place an additional chair at the table, also that she couldn't help me get a better view as they were fully booked. I guess that might have been the harbinger of a not-so-great night but fortunately she did offer to write that request down in case they did have vacant tables. When my friend and I got there, we were just ignored by the two lady workers at the entrance! I think we stood there for a few minutes before being attended to by the chinese lady who led us to our table. To be fair, I was impressed by the Indian waiter who took our order without pen or paper and served us our respective drinks as though he'd been trained to do this for a while already. Also, we ordered truffle fries which failed to excite my tastebuds. My drink, Airmail, on the other hand, went down smoothly. Because Lantern does not have cake on its menu, my friends and I brought in our own to surprise the birthday girl. The waiter who took our request made us sign a form simply because the bringing in of outside food was prohibited and in signing it, Lantern would not be liable if anyone of us felt ill. After serving us our food and drink, the wait staff simply stopped caring about our existence with the exception of a lady who kept trying to clear our table (when we haven't even finished eating) as though she was trying to chase us away?!?! I understand that we may have been the youngest group of customers that night but there really isn't a need for such prejudiced treatment!? Just felt really bad when the bar played birthday songs for others who were celebrating their birthday as well while my friend just got served a cake we bought for her by a waiter who did it begrudgingly. (Please, it was written all over his face.) Even the magnificent view of the Marina Bay skyline could not make up for the waiter's SOUR face
5
Lantern Bar, roof top terrace is just the place to enjoy a cool drink, the colors of the sunset, Singapores skyline and the Marina Bay aerea. Although the service is not at top level, I will rate this place 5 because my favorite place for a drink in Singapore. If hungry the mini burgers sand the truffel chips are fabulous
2
We asked for a table for four for drinks and were taken to the service area of the bar, having walked passed empty tables, we were then moved to another area around the bar as we were in the staffs way. We again asked if we could sit at one of the empty tables and were told it was impossible. We then sat at an empty table on the terrace and were told to move as this was a private area....no one in sight. The officious manager told us she was doing her best .....but how ridiculous when 40 mins later she seated us at one of the original tables we asked for! A fantastic setting but ridiculous staff, would never go again
5
Ok, I agree with the other reviews, it's NOT cheap. Also I'm quite annoyed that even if you order a bottle of expensive champagne they serve it in plastic cups with the excuse that the bar is in the pool areaâ€¦STILL I love this stylish elegant bar, I love the Fullerton bay and I will be coming back anytime I'm in town. Nibbles and tapas are lovely and service is nice and attentive
1
Firstly, The service staff refused twice our seating choices, even though bar is mostly empty. then they serve us "Cheap" wine at 20usd per glass, at least 30 percent more expensive compared to similar bars/restaurants nearby. The "cheap wines were so not drinkable that I would not even think of using it in my cooking in case it spoils my precious ingredients. Next, the cheap wines were served in old plastic glasses, with water particles on the glasses!! I swore they weren't condensation, but they just didn't bother drying it after wash! I had a guest visiting and was totally embarrassed! Many other bars and restaurants can be found nearby with similar view ! It's a no brainer to avoid this 
4
The Lantern Bar at the Fullerton Bay Hotel is a good restaurant for those who appreciate great views. The views are marvellous all day round and offer a great perspective of key Singapore attractions, including the most photographed building in the world; The Marina Bay Sands. The service here was extremely fast and quick but the atmosphere was quite vibrant and loud. I personally found it a bit too busy but others may love this type of atmosphere. I was currently staying at the hotel and found the Clifford restaurant a bit better. Visitors who aren't staying at the hotel will become more enticed with this restaurant because the views are excellent the first time you see them.The Lantern Bar in Singapore was moderately pricey but it could be said well worth it for the available views of Singapore river and Marina Bay Sands
5
Just like the title above:p If you wanna see the light show from the Marina Bay Sands, reserve the David seat.
5
This was an amazing place to go for a drink after dinner - beautiful location and view over the bay and superb atmosphere. Loved it and would recommend!
4
I have not much to say for this place
But only to tell you that go there for the view and you will like the food
I went there at around 7pm and the towards marina bay and the ciy was marvellous
4
Great view directly across from the Marina Bay Sands and you can watch their light show. We booked a couple weeks in advance for a Sunday evening and had a good table up the front. It is pricey but for a splurge it is nice. Service is not great and we didn't eat
5
I went rooftop bar hopping whilst in Singapore as Australia does not have many of these. We sat in the smokers area even though none of us smoked as the undercover area was so hot inside and you could not get as good a view. We ordered cocktails and enjoyed the sights. The rooftop pool looked absolutely amazing and it has definitely enticed me to book a room at the fullerton bay for that reason alone. Food and cocktails here, even the pepsi which was $7, was expensive (like the rest of Singapore) but it is worth it for the views and hours of watching the world go by
5
Bar is on top of the ultra-chic fullerton bay hotel.It provides unrivalled views over the marina bay harbour and the financial district.Layout and design is similiar to bars in Monaco and St Tropez, with a distinct european touch.Food is quick and good and so are the drinks and cocktails.If I have a guest or person to impress, this is where I would go
5
For me the Latern is the best bar in town. The atmosphere is nice, you can book comfy 'double beds' to lounge in and sip your drink and marvel about the beautiful view to Marina Bay Sands and the rest of the bay. Clearly a must when in Singapore. Food was also very nice and the cocktail menue is inviting
4
We went to the Lantern for tea at 7 (after having a drink at the Ku De Ta at MBS) so we could see the light show at Marina Bay Sands hotel across the water. Got lost getting there as we thought it was at the Fullerton Hotel and didn't realise there was a Fullerton on the Bay! Lovely restaurant and we got a table so we could see the light show which was a request I made before going. Very expensive menu. We ended up ordering entre and pizzas as it were the cheapest item on the menu ($30SGD for a small pizza).Light show was ok. It was great to look at the MBS hotel at night.Go if you have plenty of money to spend
5
and I am not sure if the view from there to Marina Bay Sands is better or vive versa - excellent drinks, great service - gorgeous rooftop pool, too - I would conisder this hotel on a next stay in Singapore....especially as residents get the first row seat
1
We didn't even bother staying to have a drink at Lantern. We were happy to stand at the bar and have a drink as there were no tables available but I was rudely told to move as I was in the service area (there was no sign and it didn't seem to matter that several men had been standing there before me for an extended period of time!). We ended up walking out after an incident with one of the wait staff. This person insisted she knew my husband and was so familiar with him that it made both of us feel quite uncomfortable. Her tone with me was quite dismissive and she seemed very surprised when we decided to walk out. I expected so much more from this bar and will definitely not recommend it to anyone I know
5
Enjoyed a glass of wine and some great appetizers at the rooftop Lantern Bar. Great views of the evening light show across the bay. Really enjoyed the sliders and the spring rolls. Great place to have a drink and relax before dinner.
5
what can you say more about this bar? simply as on the rooftop bar of fullerton bay hotel and facing singapore iconic marina bay.
3
Having ordered at the bar. It took me 3 times to remind them about our drinks. As they had an event on. Clearly they don't care about normal people. It was ladies night I believe. If that's the case it should be shut to general admission. Then they had the cheek to charge a service charge. Complete rip off. Rude staff and don't even bother going.
1
I brought my family to what i thought would be a classy al fresco sandwich bar for lunch a the Lantern Bar on a Sunday.We each ordered from the lunch menu, a different sandwich which came with a different choice of side salad and some fries. We had not been told (and the lunch menu does not indicate) that the fries are covered in truffles oil, these are horrible, they tasted like they had been cooked in old or contaminated oil, and luckily none of us had mushroom issues, as we were not aware that they were truffle oil covered until i asked why the fries tasted so 'odd'. My husband chose the duck Spring Rolls. The food was expensive at $32++ for a sandwich and $28++ for 3 duck spring rolls. That wasnt the issue however. We had selected this restaurant because earlier that week i had taken lunch in the neighbouring Post Bar restaurant over at The Fullerton Hotel. Which was again was pricey but the food was spot on. I thought lets go to the Lantern Bar because of the great views of the bay, and the food quality would be the same, oh how wrong i was...My Salmon sandwich came with half melted processed cheese slices, and the pear and walnut salad was not fresh.My Sister ordered the Club sandwich- her salad was wilted, and covered in so much ceasar dressing it was like salad soup on her plate, processed chicken, yesterday's cold fatty streaky bacon and 7 11 white bread toast made up the sandwich.My husband, who had said after consuming the first duck spring roll that he didnt was to eat the other 2 because they tasted horrible- but he proceeded as he was hungry, like we all were!. Well it turns out he should of stopped there, because as he proceeded to bite and chew into the second roll he spat out and was moments away from vomiting right there at the table. What had come out of the roll was shocking and disgusting. On close inspection on the 1 inch lumpy item that had been rejected from my husbands mouth at speed, was in fact the ankle of the duck foot, bone, blood vessels and gristle. Absolutely gross. My sisters boyfriend, wasnt there to witness this event as he had quickly consumed his club sandwich and rushed off to the bathroom. But when he returned half an hour later, he had told us he had been vomiting in the bathroom as result of consuming the sandwich he had just eaten. Luckily my sister eat only half of the sandwich because she refused to eat the rest due to the quality issues.Naturally we complained, as the meal unfolded into one bad experience after the other and the manager (eventually, after a embarrassing showcase of food examples) issued us a bill for one sandwich the boyfriend had eaten. Given the overall experience the whole lunch, and non of us actually finishing a meal. It should've been all free! We all left feeling very disappointed, still hungry and utterly shocked that the Fullerton is producing this overall poor food quality at one of their restaurants. Just one other thing as well, the house/ club music that was pumping out over the entire deck was too loud and we had to raise our voices in order to hold a conversation across the table. It was like being in a nightclub
5
Nothing quite beats the ambience of this place - as the sun goes down and the famed (and growing) Singapore skyline emerges all around the bar. Lots of space, open air and discreet (yet prompt) service adds to a sense of personal space even when the place is full. The canopy (for rainy days, I presume) just enhances the intimate appeal. And oh - they serve some really decent wine and cocktails.
3
Drinks were served in plastic glasses for a reason. Bar was just next to the hotel's pool hence in the event any glasses broke and were not cleaned thoroughly, will pose danger to users of the pool. It has a very nice ambience, music was good, however, we were seated inside the canopy, fan was not sufficient and was not windy that night. So we felt hot and was perspiring even. Overall, if you are new and would like a panoramic view of the bay, this will surely satisfy it
4
It's just as good as you would expect! The view out over Marina Bay Sands, great DJ's and a relaxed and quick service! What more could you ask for? It's very layed back and you don't have to dress up to get in and the price is as you would have guessed :
3
We visited here for drinks on a random Sat night.View and environment are good, music is a bit 80s/ 90s and too loud to cover people chatting though, just being silent and enjoy the drinks then. We ordered two bottles of white wine (SGD 1xx each). After finishing the wine, waiter was friendly to 'offer' us the chance to try their shots (which is not on the menu). We accepted and noted the price of the shots after drinking. EACH shot costed SGD 18...I must have to say, if it happens in other places, normally after ordering two bottles of wine (which are not cheap yeah?), people would be friendly enough to offer (free) shots, Oh well, maybe we had high expectation of this place. Service def. disappointed us.End up we paid SGD 400+ for four persons. Not considering to visit here from time to time. Too costly and def. doesn't worth at all.... I believe else where can find a better price for drinks also with the view*My rating is purely giving to the view not to the service and the price of this barCheers
3
We called in here for a drink on a lovely day in Singapore as referred by friends for the amazing view. It was pretty spectacular but on the day we attended the staff were a little pre-occupied and not very attentive, a couple of tables held some very drunk customers who were quite loud and over the top, one couple were drinking heavily and playing chess and demanding a fair bit of attention. We ordered from the limited menu and were quite surprised at the cost for food and drinks. 2 chicken wraps, 1 beer and 1 wine - $119.00 SG dollars. The glass of wine at $25.00 was a ridiculous price even for singapore standards as when it was delivered it came in a PLASTIC goblet. We are not sure what the significance of the plastic goblet was but at $25.00 a glass (as listed on the menu) you would have thought it would have come In a Glass. Pretty disappointing food and wine for that sort of price and it quite spoilt the view
3
This is a nice place to hang, not cheap i would have to say for what you are getting. Has a nice vibe to it,though seems hard to get a seat if you are not eating.The staff are ok,bartenders seem a little too interested in the women then actually the job at hand.Seem hard at times to be served a simple glass of wine. Food is nothing new and special,though i guess the location is what you pay for
5
If you are looking for a nice comfy place to unwind, then this place is it. You are given a very picturesque view of the waters of Singapore. It's just a hassle when the weather is humid. They should have more fans.
5
If you like a rather calming bar with good music but not loud, this is the place. The view is great, the cocktails are well made, and the sofas relaxing. I've visited many bars in Singapore but this is by far my favorite!!
4
Claimed a fabulous day bed with canopy and enjoyed the day, simply lazing by the pool, enjoying lunch, dinner and drinks. A fabulous location and ambiance
5
Best view and drink in Singapore. Not over the top and service is good. Truffle fries are good and light fare is perfect for enjoying the panoramic view of Singapore.
3
View is great, no doubt. But do we eat that for dinner? NO.
May be food and presentable drink glasses is not their priority, using the disposable kind of material. Plus too hot.
5
Great spot when its not too hot. Friendly staff and magnificent views. Bar is right along side infinity pool which looks beautiful in the evening. No bar stools so one cant have a drink alone by the bar unless you want to stand.
5
We meet friends for a cocktail at Lantern Bar @ the Fullerton Bay Hotel. The view is great. You look out over the Marina back toward teh Esplande Theatres, the Marina Sands & the Merlion. The colour & movement is wonderful to watch as you enjoy friends & food.You are also in a good spot the watch the Marina Bay Sands Light show. Wed till Sunday. The have a snaks menu for dinner & a good cocktail list. Staff great 
4
1st time, I have been at Lantern to dine with friends. Beautiful setting, breezy, excellent to have a drink. We had some food and light bites to accompany. Average quality and cold ( probably due to the wind). 2nd time we were with a few friends, had a lot of pricey cocktails without dining. The establishment could have offered some snacks .
5
Don't miss this place for a glass of wine comfortably seatead on one of the sofas facing the bay and marina bay hotel and neighbouring towers. All around the pool there are tables and sofas with a soft atmosphere emphasized by soft lights and candles. Lounge music accompanies the evening together with some cool breeze...Have a snack with your wine and enjoy the view and all the city buzz around you..we found it as one of the most romantic place in Singapore..not to be missed
4
On my birthday which fell on a Sunday, I decided to have Brunch. Walked right into the Hotel lobby with no hassle and it was which was it spotlessly clean and grand. I simply love the view from the rooftop restaurant. I ate the Lamb which was perfectly cook to my liking. The Fries that came with it was cooked with some oil thus it definitely tasted different from your regular Fast Food Restaurant.I was more pleased when the staff brought and sang a birthday song for me. Better yet it was a Chocholate Fudge cake (my favourite)

Loved this and went every night of my stay at the Fullerton Nay. And Wednesday nights are ladies nights.

I gave a lot of thought to my rooftop drink and light snack destination with so many options. The Lantern certainly delivers on a nice location with great views of MBS. The rooftop area was spacious and tables spread comfortably. Service and food on the other hand were disappointing. We were a couple and seated at a table with five chairs crowded around it...but ok, it's a popular spot and perhaps most groups are larger. We easily waited over 10 minutes for a menu and after another 15 minutes we requested someone to take our order. We ordered sliders and the truffle FF to accompany our wine. The potatoes were tasty but the burgers were over-cooked and the buns dried out. With such a nice location in a beautiful building more investment in the food and staff is needed before this sees a return
5
The Lantern Bar is in just the right night spot. Set up on the roof of the Fullerton Bay Hotel, you can take a romantic walk from the old Fullerton Hotel and then along the boardwalk to the FBH, then take the lift to the Lantern where the Bay stretches out in front of you, dominated by the three towers and ship-on-the-roof of the Marina Bays Sands Hotel. Watch the little ferries criss-cross the Bay and head around the corner towards Clark Quay. Take in the light show from the Sands Hotel, with the soundtrack wafting in and out on the breeze. Tables are scattered around the bar and pool (go for one on the outer edge), and the service is good. Cocktails are the order of the night, and the snacks are above average. There is music from a DJ, but its not intrusive for those wanting conversation or who are on the Bay side tables.Then as you leave, make sure to have a look through the glass wall of the horizon pool to see the eerie lights under water as the pool stretches back to the hotel
5
This place is an all-around winner: stunning views, attentive service, talented bartenders and a stylish and sophisticated atmosphere. It's the closest you can get to a Miami Beach scene in Singapore. It's a great place to watch the MBS laser show and a perfect place to bring out-of-town guests. Tables can be hard to come by -- even on weekdays -- so be sure to call ahead for a reservation

We took our daughter for a pre-dinner drink at the Lantern bar. It was a good experience throughout.The reservation was handled professionally (including a reminder earlier in the day). Our table was ready we arrived and we had a great view of the Marina Harbor. As we were there only for a drink, we did not order any snack with our drinks. They kept topping up the nuts without any prompting and were attentive throughout.The prices were a bit up-market but the view, ambiance & service made-up for it.Would recommend it to visitors to Singapore
5
This is definitely somewhere I would recommend if visiting Singapore. It is a bit more laid-back than Ku De Ta at the Marina Bay Sands, and has amazing views. A few of the tables with the best views seemed to be unoccupied for the night. When we asked a waitress if we could move, she seemed a little hesitant, but eventually agreed that we could move as long as we we vacated the table for 10.30/11pm so it is worth asking about the empty tables. The cocktail list was extensive, with a lot of variety. We had the wagyu beef sliders which were really good. The light show was great, hard to believe it is a regular occurrence. Apparently there are some evenings when women get free drinks so that would be worth checking out. The pool looks amazing, I am sorry that I wasn't staying there to avail of it
4
Very cool place the watch the daily laser show across the Marina. You arrive via the lift to the amazing infinity pool and are escorted to your table. Service is standard Singapore style (a bit hap-hazard). Our chairs looked very trendy, but weren't particularly comfortable. The cocktails are amazing, just remember to bring your credit card!
4
Location (roof-top of Fullerton bay hotel, by the pool) is amazing. It^s facing the White Sands Complex, and at night, is really breathtaking. The food is of good quality, although pretentiously priced. But that is probably true in most locations in Singapore. I would recommend the mini Beef Waygu Burgers as they were our favorite. Cocktails were also good
4
Some really good food - great Kobe sliders, cod with miso and flatbreads amongst a decent Asian fusion menu means it's not just about the view. Which is fantastic. There's a real Ibiza vibe with some cool laidback tunes, but this is one of those classics bars-restaurants where it's the whole package that makes it. I'd quite happily have stayed til being kicked out, but as always others wanted to move on. Already looking forward to when I might go agai
3
Great view from the roof-terrace to Marina bay,specialy when the laser show is on.A bit pricey for the drinks and food but the view is the resone why you go up there.Make sure you get at night time.location local brillant specialy with the Pool
3
A great place to watch the Marina Bay and the laser show. The atmosphere is amazing.
Food is average. Good to sit and watch the view.
4
Food was really good and service was excellent.
No happy hour promotions thou but a nice place to bring your clients or dates because of its great view.
Service Crew and managers are excellent.
5
Was staying in the hotel anyway, but great rooftop venue, views over the water, Singapore skyline and the Marina Bay Sands. Cutesy bar snacks (Wagyu beef sliders, really!) and exotic cocktails! Nice place to while away a couple of hours in Singapore
4
Going to restaurants is about more than just eating, and if you visit Singapore without a visit to this rooftop restaurant and bar you really will be missing something. The view over the Bay is fabulous, and the atmosphere with glass-walled swimming pool and funky music just great. The service was attentive and friendly but the food was OK, and pretty expensive for some very small portions
4
Spent a few drinks sessions with clients and friends while staying at the hotel for work. My reservation for 6 turned out to be a table for 4, with just 4 chairs and the other 2 chairs took awhile to be brought to us. My party stood around the otherwise seated bar. Service was very iffy on my first night there, but after feedback it was subsequently rectified. Spent some time there again the next day swimming and having drinks and the service was much better. Worth a visit for the lovely view of the bay and for the refreshing, creative cocktails with fitting names like Red Lantern. The mini sliders and truffle fries were delicious as well. I much enjoyed the sunday afternoon till early evening spent there over the saturday night experience. Although I must add that the night view offers a great show of lights from the Marina Bay Sands area
5
My friends and I went to the Lantern Bar for drinks before heading to Ku De Ta for dinner, I only wish we had spent our whole evening at the Lantern as it's such a beautiful rooftop bar. Great service with lovely views of the city - see picture - and in my view much better than the MBS hotel with its homage to all things opulent. The Lantern Bar is really a lovely place to hangout with friends, comes across as cool and classy without being over the top and look as if it's trying too hard. Sharing a bottle of champs at this bar, celebrating my bday with some of my closest friends was a wonderful experience that I will remember forever. Whether you are just visiting or live in Singapore, a drink at this beautiful and cool looking bar is a must
5
the view is better than from the marina bay sands bar! the whole hotel seemed to be concepted with lot of taste (we didnt stay as guests) and also the rooftop is stunning as soon you leave the elevator! we enjoyed just having a cocktail (surprisingly strong but tasty!) and enjoy the view, so we didnt try the food. the service itself was not too good but i would definitely visit on my next trip to singapore, the view and atmosphere just put you in that amazing mood right away :
5
The view it self worthy of a 5 star!! Great service, exotic cocktails and delicious snack, the wagyu beef sliders and truffle fries is a must try. The price is slightly on higher scale but expected considering the set up and the location. Definitely the place to be away from the chaotic city
5
A great place to watch the marina Bay laser show and chill out with friends. Whilst not cheap the drinks are well mixed and the food (snacks in our case) are a good quality. Staff service is efficient and professional. We went without booking on a Wednesday night but we had a good location
2
beautiful view, ridiculous price. The hotel seem to mistake luxury with arrogance and prevention. For Lunch:- 2 slices of Mozzarela and a piece of bread for 28$ before taxes- 4 Tiger prawns (nothing else) for 52$...Ridiculous when one can have a proper lunch set in a fine dining restaurant for less than 40$So yes the view is nice, but you can get it for free so why going there
4
Great service and spectacular views. Even have bed chairs so you can lay down and watch the view. Good selection of drinks and nibbles. Slightly pricey but typical for the equivalent
5
This is a must when in Singapore! Overlooking the Marina Sands Bay, it offers amazing views (especially when the Laser & Light show is on). Definitely the place for the hip crowd in the city. Perfect for an after dinner drink!
4
I was there just to share a bottle of wine with a colleague. It's very nice to sit outside even if it hasn't the spectacular view of other roof-top bars (since it's on a much lower level). The service is attentive and fast.
3
Badly organised. Too many children. service was not very attentive. Granted they were busy, but that should not be an issue for a city centre, well attended venue.
4
At sundown, the lighting effect from the laser lights of Marina Bay Sand are amazing, all around the waterfront are beautiful lit up. Best place to be in the evening for drinks. Standby your camera too ! I have too many beautiful pictures taken there.We tried almost all of the bar snacks, not too bad
4
The restaurant attached to Fullerton Bay Hotel is a beautifully decorated Chinese food restaurant. This is of the highest and finest caliber location, and the decor is perfect. Worth a look even if you are not eating nor staying here. However, the food was somewhat Average, and the wait staff was not Chinese, and knew nothing about the dishes we were ordering. I would suggest to management, that they invite the wait staff to taste a meal, and know whether or not it is spicy, salty, rich, creamy, etc so that they can assist guests in ordering a particular dish. That was very disappointing in a city like Singapore. They also seemed to be very busy chatting with each other, and commenting about other guests, but not as interested in attending to our table. Perhaps my frustration is also based on the very high $50 per dinner, which included zero alcohol. There are so many options available in the Collyer Quay area, I would look elsewhere. I'd give it a B
4
Went to lantern bar for few drinks while we were visiting Singapore. I made the reservation at least 2 months ago and requested for a good table but when we went we were offered table in the centre near the bar which was disappointing considering that we booked well in advance to secure a good table with good reviews. Service is average but view are great of marina bay sands. Cocktails are good too
4
This is a great vantage point to savour the skyline and admire the engineering feat of Marina Bay Sands. This is not a place for dinner though - more suitable for casual evening drinks. On a cloudy day, afternoon drinks and snacks are fine but it can get really hot on regular days.Great place to bring visitors 
3
This has to be one of the best placed bars in Singapore. Beautifully restored building - the old Clifford Quay - and the entrance when you exit the lift at the rooftop has the real WOW factor..stunning pool, lighting and bar area overlooking the river and looking at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer and the Museum..really can't be faulted. Good ambience - cool crowd and DJ..all perfect except...the staff are hopeless! All tables were full but we asked to reserve one for later but were told we had to phone for reservations..even though we were stood next to reception and the appointment book! Asked if they could call us in the resturant downstairs where we were eating if a table came free later - told it wasn't possible as we had to call! Madness!So if you want to go..and would like a table - make sure you call in advance.Great place spoilt by ridiculous interpertation of "the rules"Shame
5
Perched on the rooftop of Fullerton Bay Hotel beside the pool is the Lantern Bar, which offers magnificent views of Marina Bay. Price of drinks are on the expensive side, but it's a fantastic place to soak in the view, the vibe and have some cocktails and drinks before heading to the clubs in Singapore if you like nightlife. The bar is beautifully sculpted and makes a number of cocktails using fresh fruits from the region. Definitely recommended for visitors who like the nightlife scene
4
Go for a couple of drinks to take in the view it's a great hotel great spot, food bit pricey but you are in a tourist spot.
4
Great little bar at the rooftop pool area of the hotel. Recommend a G&T with the truffle fries whilst watching the sunset set over the water... bliss! The Wagu sliders are pretty good too.
4
This is a lovely place on the harbour, the view is nice, great atmosphere. The food was good except for one dish which was quickly replaced and dealt with by the manager. Try the margaritas!. Well worth a visit!
4
Quite a funky atmosphere with the bar next to the hotel's rooftop pool. Great cocktails and a dj playing music but not at ridiculous volumes. Service was good too.
5
Great place for pre-dinner drinks. Also has great food - the truffle chips and the mini-bugers were amazing!!
5
Love this bar ! Best bar in Singapore ! Absolutely amazing. Shame drinks are served in hard plastic glass. It's pricey but absolutely worth a visit.We had drinks and then decided to stay for a bite. Food was delicious. Will definitely go back many times !
4
This is a top spot to take visitors for an evening drink. The views are superb. The drinks are expensive even for Singapore. There is a good bar menu but I wish establishments would stop thinking fries with truffle oil give a touch of class. It doesn't. It's a particular taste which not everyone likes so truffle oil should at least be optional. The staff here are friendly and accommodating but trying to get a second drink can be difficult
2
For a five star hotel this place sure has bad service, although that is the rule more than the exception in Singapore. My $20 beer was served in a small plastic glass warm and flat. To their credit when I complained they made it right by giving me a free drink, but still, this isn't something that should happen in a five star hotel, ever
2
Simplest cocktail in the world has to be a Gin & Tonic. What can go wrong? Apparently, flat tonic can go wrong. And a stingy measure of gin can go wrong on the second attempt. Lantern, if you're going to charge a premium for drinks, at least get the basics right! And i agree with the below - the spring rolls were strange and fishy, but the sliders were pretty good. Can we get over the truffle fries already? They are so Bubble Tea last year!
5
I think the first impression is set when you step out of the elevator and see the pool in front of you. The bar is amazing, the drinks great and the view especially when the sun goes down is brilliant! Yes the drinks aren't cheap but then again drinks aren't cheap in Singapore. For a hotel bar it isn't over priced and the view more than makes up for it. Service was average but then again the bar was busy
4
The Lantern Bar is the perfect place to come if you are trying to impress someone as the views are just awesome... the food is quite special too but the service is quite ordinary, maybe they are short-staffed.
5
Food, wine and wonderful atmosphere. Perfect location to sit back and watch the nightly light show whilst enjoying the ambience of this fantastic hotel.
4
Seated in the Lantern you have a wonderful view of the Bay and the light show across the Bay at the Marina Bay Sands. The food was great - the service was just ok.
5
Spectacular setting and great ambience. This rooftop bar has amazing views across Marina Bay, with the Marina Bay Sands Hotel dominating the scene. Food is delicious and the wine and cocktail list is exceptional.
4
Loved to spend my evening in Lantern after busy day.
The view, the drinks and sunset will make the evening even brighter.
3
Yes: great location + great view of Marina Bay.A modern and relaxing pool. nice and fashion environment.No: hi prices for average quality cocktail sered in plastic glasses.Service so and so. (we ordered one beer and one cocktail; they brought the beer and, ten minutes later the cocktail).At least they bring a lot of peanuts for free
2
I reviewed this bar before and gave it 5 stars, but that was after only the first visit. I was overwhelmed by the stting (which is overwhelming). The view of Marina Bay, the ambience, it is 5 stars. BUT. The service is appalling. Truly atrocious. And not for the first time, it's now the 6-7th time we've been there with the same experience. You have to literally flag down a waiter (almost get out of your seat and approach them before you get their attention. We flagged town a 'waiter' who was clearing tables to ask if we could place an order and he simply said "no, wait until someone else comes to take your order". The food is bad. We ordered duck and nori spring rolls and they are a weird combinatiion of fish and duck, and taste a bit fishy and gross. The crumbed calamari is tasteless and a bit oily. The chicken and beef satays are mediocre. All drinks are served in plastic glasses. One night I brought my own glass, and they refused to serve me in it, as it's against the law. 5 star? No, for 5 star prices you would expect excellent food and glass glasses. The location/venue is the only thing this place has going for it
4
We went there for the first time and were seated very quickly in the smoking area of the terrace as required by me. Reception and Service were very efficient. We had a glass of whisky, a glass of Chardonnay and 2 small bottles of Evian (PET 33 cl). The bill came to SGD 64.75 incl service and tax. Atmosphere was good, the view wonderful, service very good. Overall a very good experience
3
It's a nice place to chill, drink and catch up with friends. Lovely view for sure. Service can be a little strain especially when it is busy. The place can be warm under the canopy, and drinking wine and mixers from plastic cups makes the place seem a little cheap
4
While in Singapore I dropped by Lantern to have a quick bite to eat and cocktail with a view. The drinks, entertainment, and view were amazing, however, the food menu left a little more to be desired. For drinks with a date, I highly suggest, however, if you are looking for food as well, I'd try something different
5
A great location in the evenings at the roof terrace bar “Lantern” enjoying cocktails and a lovely view over the river. You will need to book.
5
A must stay / see place in SG! Good food, great drinks & the perfect music by resident DJ Damien. Great crowd enjoying top quality products with the bay / MBS view... what else!?

Lovely LANTERN!The intrepid Travelling Gourmet Dr. Michael Lim finds nocturnal pleasures and…MAGNIFICENT & marvellous views of Clifford Bay in LANTERN, arguably Singapore’s BEST rooftop lounge bar on the roof of Fullerton Bay hotel, which used to be Clifford Pier years ago. Coming here brought to mind that immortal song, Lili Marlene, the Regimental Marching Song of the SAS.Ravishing RED LANTERN!As my crimson cocktail arrived, rockets and great balls of psychedelic fireworks exploded loudly behind the ArtsScience Museum lighting up the jet black night sky…it was a perfect point of view. The intense flavour of water melon from the Red Lantern cocktail teased my palate, and I could taste the cucumber and lemon melded with the premium tequila on the mid palate. I liked the little chunks of water melon inside which gave the drink added texture. It was delicious with cute and cuddly Mini Wagyu Beef Burgers with fresh tomato and juicy meaty, plump burger patty done ‘medium’. Another excellent cocktail is the English Summer Mojito with Rum, Raspberry, Strawberry and garnished with a sprig of fresh Mint. I adore it with the Signature Duck Nori Spring Rolls with sweet and mildly spicy Chilli Sauce with a lavosh-thin ultra-crispy skin and toothsome flavoursome filling. As Giovanni Viterale, the charming General Manager of Fullerton Heritage which includes the iconic Fullerton Hotel puts it, “Allora, the splendid panoramic view of the beautiful Bay, the laser light show and the Fullerton…bellissima!” I agree. Being in the Lantern savouring the ‘superbo’ Nibbles and enchanting cocktails…makes you feel very happy…and very special.I recommend too the Crumbed Calamari Skewers with a soothing zesty Lemon Herb Relish & Tomato Lime dip. Perfect with the Magarita Madness ‘More Berries’ with potent Patron Silver Tequila, Strawberry, Raspberry, Fresh Lime Juice and Sugar “Gome” Syrup. I also adore the big swimming pool and two jacuzzis here which is so inviting. The panoramic view from the jacuzzi of the “Two Durians”, the Fullerton Hotel that used to be the GPO and Marina Square is spectacular. A hedonist’s dream come true...A tranquil and luxurious way to spend an evening is to come to Lantern at about 5.30pm. Then slowly watch the sunset over Fullerton Bay while enjoying a Mojito…or two…or three.Here in the Lantern, you really feel like you are on top of the world savouring captivating cocktails…and feasting your eyes on the mesmerising views of Singapore’s answer to Sydney Harbour. ENJOY! {:-)Incidentally, Lantern derives its name from Clifford Pier’s historical Chinese name – “Red Lantern Pier”. It was a landing point for Singapore’s first immigrants and red lanterns used to hang from the pier as a guide to seafarers.”Lantern Rootop Bar LoungeLevel 7The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore80 Collyer QuaySingapore 049326Tel: 65 6597 5299Hours: Lantern is open daily from 8.00am to 1.00am from Sunday to Thursday and 8.00am to 2.00am on Friday, Saturday and Public Holidays

I'd heard so many good things about the Lantern Bar, so couldn't wait when I finally got around to visiting. I hadn't booked, but the staff were good enough to find me a table for a couple of hours until the people who had booked it turned up - perfect. The drinks were really good (their signature mojitos are expensive but delicious) but I was really disappointed with the view... this should be amazing, but the cheap-looking marquee-type covering blocks out so much of the view, on the whole you could be sitting anywhere - what a let down!
4
I was in Singapore on a short work related trip. Was invited by colleagues from Citibank to join them for the Launching of Lantern Bar's Ladies Night. My first perception of the place was “wow, awesome view". Hence, if you want to go to a place with a view to die for; Lantern is the place in Singapore. As for the Ladies Night, the place was a mess I must say. It was packed with too many people. But I guess it’s understandable as it was the launching. We were seated far from the Bar and it took almost 15 minutes for our drinks to be served. I would strongly suggest that the Management look into opening more counters/bars for the drinks to reduce the waiting time. As for the drink, it was too diluted. They had added too much mixer till we could not taste the vodka. They were handing out door gifts to ladies but it was limited. As such, none of us got any which I feel was not fair. All ladies should have gotten the door gift. The management should look into such details in the future. If i am not mistaken, I believe i was seated not far from t_yanlin ( i could be wrong as the place was extremely crowded). We had seen was took place. Personally, i find the staff there to be very polite and nice. They were very apologetic because the drinks took some time to be served and explained to us its because of the overwhelming crowd which we completely understood. The service staff was indeed working their life off trying to cope. As for the Manager ( indian/malay chap), he was indeed polite too and was definitely trying to explain to t_yanlin and her friends the matter but the ladies seem to not care and started to raise their voice at him. Myself and my colleague had felt very sorry for the Manager as he was trying his best to talk to the ladies but they just refused to pay for the drink which was clearly ordered from the menu as it was not served during the Ladies Night Free Flow. The ladies were creating such a scene that many of us at the surrounding area did take notice of what was happening. So, i believe i am talking about the same incident t_yanlin is referring to. The best part of the incident was, after the poor manager agreed to remove the drinks from the bill and walked away to prepare the new bill, the ladies were laughing at him which i and my colleague thought to be very childish and not cool. Seems to us that they were intending for free drinks. Overall, I feel the launching was not perfect but I would definitely visit the place again on a normal day to experience the actual service and offer. but the view that Lantern offers is breathtaking and way better than Kudeta. Shall update more on my second visit.... Cheers
1
Food was good and the view of the marina was stunning. Nice place to chill out if not for the bad customer service by the Manager himself. Ordered food and free flow drinks on the house (that was part of the event) and had to wait for more than half hour. Asking for the bill also took 15min and we were charged for the drinks. Turns out that the waiter who took our order gave us the wrong info, and the drinks that he told us was on the house wasn't. When the drinks were served, we were not being informed either. But the manager insisted that because we drank it, we had to pay for it, even though it was the waiter's mistake. Manager refused to get the waiter over to clarify the matter, which was very suspicious. Raised his voice to intimidate us, which was extremely unprofessional. After 15-20min, he finally relented and bill us for the food only, without failing to highlight that it was on a very exceptional basis. No apology at all from the Manager or the waiter. Manager's final comment that he hoped our evening was not spoilt was sarcastic indeed
5
Amazing outdoor rooftop bar overlooking the Marina Bay Sands Casino development and the Singapore skyline. Impressive hotel pool greets you as you exit the lift onto the roof - great tracks being played as ambient back ground - was not too loud at the time we were there.Relaxing atmosphere when we arrived early in the week - all though I'm sure on promotion nights or towards the end of the week this would be a place to be seen.Great Asian inspired cocktails - just be prepared to shell out a few $$ - it is Singapore after all
5
Beautiful lounge bar outdoors, perfect for pre drinks, or even afternoon lunch. We were staying at the main Fullerton hotel so were also allowed to use the pool here which is amazing, and the view are superb from here. You must go here even if it is for a coffee. Good place to watch the light/water show from too
5
This is a great bar for intimate drinks in the evening whilst enjoying a wonderful view. It gets busy to call ahead and book a table (kick off your shoes and lounge on the 'sun bed' type seating at the edge of the terrace for the best views).Drinks are expensive, but that it only to be expected at a place like this. Still worth a visit
4
The views are great, perched on top of the very tasteful and elegant Fullerton Bay Hotel, Drinks are not cheap, but this is to be expected given its unique vantage point. One setback is it can be humid and slightly uncomfortable, as the venue is not airconditione
5
Wonderful, food,drinks and locations, could have stayed for hours and also great place to hang by pool also......
4
The truffles fries were amazing. It had a great view of the marina.
4
Look onto Marina Bay and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel while sipping on cocktails. The drinks are great, the service is not bad and the pool area is magnificent. Service was a bit slow the day we were there.
4
Was there on a company's event. The Lantern is just by the hotel's pool with marvelous view of the Marina Boulevard and Marina Bay Sands. Nice place for chill out.
4
Nice decor (like the other reviewers said so i dont go into it) and decent drinks, i ordered the burger from the restaurant next to it. Delish, one of the best burgers in Singapore. Perfectly cooked, high quality juicy meat. Delishly soft bun but not soggy. YUM
4
We spent our first night in Singapore at Lantern. As you arrived on the top floor and catch the view when the lift doors open, you have to say wow. The pool lighting and the skyline behind made a very striking "opening" . The place was crowded, being a Friday I guess, but we got a table without having to wait too long. There was good music and drinks, particularly loved the truffle fries. Never had this before and I urge you to try it when you are there. Fun night.
5
Quite simple, Lantern is the best place in Singapore. whether you are a resident like me, or a tourist - every time you emerge from the lifts onto the Lantern rooftop, your breath is taken away.Stunning location, wonderful views, very cool music and great hospitality makes this place a mix of Italian beach club meets LA rooftop meets Asia cool. Every visitor - whether tourist or business traveller that I'd brought to Lantern has had their breath taken away - and makes them start talking about Singapore as a place to live - it's that good.Grab a table, relax, order a mojito, listen to the cruisy house music and enjoy the sights of the beautiful people, Marina Bay Sands in the distance and the skyline of Singapore behind you.It's clearly the #1 location in Singapore
5
I often bring visitors to Singapore to Lantern, i did find recently that the cocktail quality had gone down a little - so hopefully this can be addressed, The service is slow but this is a place where you sit back relax and enjoy the view and make a night of it rather than it be part of a pub crawl etc.
4
Went twice - once with a big group where we had a reserved area; and another time with a couple of friends for a table setting nearer the "front" (overlooking Marina Bay).Both times staff were a bit mixed - sometimes excellent but occasionally forgetting to bring drinks and had to ask twice. Drinks in plastic cups is disappointing in an otherwise glamorous location like this.Beautiful view over Marina Bay, at least from some parts of the outdoor area.Would have been fun to swim at night, though I'm not sure if this is allowed. Never saw anyone in the pool, but it looks very nice sparkling in the night lights.Music is good and not too loud, so it's possible to carry on a decent conversation here, unlike some other bars and clubs where the music dominates
3
The bar is located on a great spot with great views over the skyline and the bay. However, drinks are not as top-notch as the setting.- all drinks are served in plastic glasses. What a strange idea (the proximity of the pool should be no excuse)!- cocktails are quite average (too much ice, not enough flavor), wines by the glass as well (but, obviously, the plastic glass does not help)- snacks are okay-is
5
What a great location on the rooftop of the Hotel. Best views of Marina Bay
5
cozy and stylish seating area, cocktails was excellent, and has the best view of all.
5
I went here for lunch and cocktails. Its reasonable for drinks by Singapore's standards at $20 and you can just enjoy the wonderful atmosphere. Food was expensive but absolutely delicious and I would say its worth it for the setting. Very enjoyable experience.
5
Wow! This a place to impress & be impressed. Excellent cocktails at a stunning location with superb view. It can't get any better. Much more relaxed than the crowded KUDETA bar.
4
This must be the most magical setting in Singapore. The view of the Marina Bay is mind-boggling, and the romantic fairy lights in the bar add to the ambience. We took my parents in law and they couldn't believe it. The food is good, but not excellent. The only really disappointing thing is that drinks are served in plastic glasses. I really don't understand this - it's otherwise an upmarket place.Service was very good. A lovely evening
5
ok, so we paid 140 singapore dollars, but from the moment we arrived, our champagne glasses were topped up continuosly with moet. The buffet was incredible. Lobster,crab,oysters, scallops,mussels. froi gras beef, lamb,duck etc etc. all prepared beautifully accompanied by lots of salads and pastes and sauces. The desserts were endless. In all we ate and drank for 3 and half hours, next to the river. A really special treat for anyone you want to impres
5
I do not say that the best way how to spend a day in Singapore is siting by the pool in the Fullerton Bay Hotel, but if you like the skyline and fresh breeze in your hair you should spend there at least one night. Great place to go after dinner, sumptuous drinks, great view, skilled DJ and good service. What else can you ask for? On top of it - you can smoke here as the part of the club which is outside the tent lets you enjoy you well deserved evening cigar :-)
5
I called ahead for a reservation for dinner/drinks with a girlfriend recently, and they said they were booked but that we could eat and drink at the bar. Because she was visiting Singapore and it's such a nice view of the bay for a visitor to enjoy, I thought we should give it a try anyway. We got there, and first, they indulged us in taking several pictures of the two of us with both of our cameras, and then went ahead and seated us at a great table overlooking the water. Once seated, the excellent service continued, and the food (we ordered several light bites to share) and wine was great. I will definitely go back

Gorgeous, modern, trendy roof top bar at the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Open every night, every holiday. Amazing cocktails - try the Lantern which I believe has watermelon juice and tequila as the main ingredients. 24 Sing dollars.Highly recommended to see and be seen, enjoy the beautiful Singapore weather and view

Went here after a full day of meetings and have to say this place did not disapoint. amazing views on the balcony, sat...lounged on one of their sofa bed things and chilled while having cocktails and a mezze platter.This is a must have experience when in Singapore, check this place out, even if you cant afford to stay at the hotel experience the bar, with the glass swimming pool in the middle and the amazing view as you take in the breeze and relax. get there before the rush however as I expect this place gets very busy. I went there at 3.30 ish and found it almost empty which was perfect for me.There were a lot of bar and waiting staff and while we were served by freindly staff seeing them in the background talking to each other constantly was a bit annoying but couldnt remove from the experience.I found that, based on Singapore prices. the mezze platter (although small) and drinks were good value and what I would have expected to pay there
