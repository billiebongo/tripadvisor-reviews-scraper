Our 2nd visit here.
A very small cosy area to seat around and get yourself a treatea time.
We ordered ice blended houjicha and O-matcha milk. Both are nice and is best recommended. If you love green tea(s), you should be here!

Visited the outlet at Centrepoint after lunch. It's quite a small outlet with limited seats. The Matcha desserts here tasted authentic and nice and esp. good for green tea fans.

I love this place. The matcha latte is the next closest beverage I had in Japan. The matcha cake & roll I had were not too sweet and the taste of matcha was not too overwhelming.

Just saw this place as we bimbled through the mall and was drawn in by the green tea roll. Lovely. Just try it.

Most matcha ice cream or dessert have been added with sugar but I guess not for Tsujiri. It tastes really nice and original.
I recommend to get the Parfait as you get the shiratama, red bean and the jelly all inclusive.

They serves many variety of ice cream here, their signature o-matcha ice cream is a must try. Just right, not so sweet with rich natural green tea flavour. A cup of green tea ice-cream is SGD5. They preserved the Japanese serving culture, as the boss serving today at counter is a Japanese. Very friendly.

On a hot Sunday, the Matcha Parfait did not allow me to walk pass without tasting it.No regret.The sweet gave me certain energy to walk on.The shop faces the river walk.Some tables outside.Small number of seats inside to taste it under AC

I love the matcha green tea ice cream here. You can have just tht on its own or variations on the theme that include crushed ice, tapioca balls and red bean paste for the super sweet toothed amongst you. They have a small air conditioned indoor seating area as well as outdoor seating along clarke quay

The soft-serve is average. So is the matcha roll and the white chocolate and matcha cake.Note: I like matcha and get my fix on every trip to Kyoto, so pardon that my review of Tsujiri may be unfair as it is possible that it relaxes its recipe to suit the non-japanese taste buds.

I visited this place a week ago. I tried Matcha Soft Serve ice cream with cone. The ice cream was full of nice matcha aroma. Little bitter taste and not too sweet. Like it!! Sugar cone was nice and crispy. The service was decent without any smile.
