Now that's what I call Ramen! just perfect balance between richness of the broth and tenderness of the pork slices. Restaurant could get kinda hot especially when it's packed but that's completely alright.

Went there twice within a day!
Simply love the soup and age-gyoza.
The egg was perfectly done, best that I had came across in Singapore.
Awesome service staff.
Will be returning real soon üëçüëç

I am not a fan of Japanese ramen. I prefer the Chinese style noodle soup, like Wan Ton Mee. It was with a little bit of apprehension I entered this restaurant to have ramen. I ordered a chicken ramen and requested it to be less salty. This is the first time I enjoyed ramen. It was really good. The chicken broth was delicious and the chicken was tender. My son ordered the pork ramen. The pork was a bit tough. Probably overcooked. The broth was too salty for out taste. The fried chicken was expensive for 4 tiny pieces but was good, The Aburi salmon was a let down. Over cooked and hard. The yakitory was good. The best bet in this restaurant is to stick to ramen but do not forget to ask for less salt.The staff were nice and polite. They kept to their their declaration for being cheerful and energetic. Really worth a second visit

Ordered the nori tama uma and spicy torotama(limited time). First thing that surprised me was when the server kneeled down to take my order. Even though the ocha came iced when I ordered hot, my girlfriend was willing to let it go. The ramen came and the broth was thick and flavourful. The torotama was surprisingly refreshing. Slightly spicy so got to be careful. Gyoza came together with the set which was quite different from typical gyoza that I've had. Overall good experience and would recommend this place

Fun, informal raman noodle shop that has the best Japanese raman we have ever eaten - except in Tokyo. Rich, pork-flavored soup with pork, egg and noodles is a most satisfying comfort food for any weather. Enthusiasm is their motto and they live up to it. If you like raman, or think you may, try this place out. It is a big meal with big flavors

This restaurant offers different menus from Japanese food and i could say that i liked the food their serving. I ordered Gyoza and and Aburi- Salmon and i could say that they were nicely cooked. The service should have some improvement but overall i would recommend this restaurant

I had the Nori-Tama-Uma ramen, which came in a rich pork-flavoured shoyu soup with a generous thick cut of grilled chashu, three pieces of seaweed, and a flavoured egg. Wow!We also had a side order of the pan-fried gyoza. These were lightly fried till crisp but the filling was still juicy. Overall, this was a very satisfying meal

Went on a Sunday evening around 730pm and we had to sit outside as inside was packed. It was hot. Free water was served. Ordered a kids ramen (seaweed, chashu & corn) at $7.90++ which came with a free orange (juice?) for my 2 young children and they couldn't finish it. We ordered the ramen with seaweed, chashu and egg at $16.90++ each. Remember to get a pamphlet near the lift lobby and you get the egg free, so you will save $2. The soup is a little salty which is normal for Japanese soup. The ramen is a bit hard. Average taste as we tried better ramen elsewhere. Price is reasonable for casual dining

This is my go-to place when I want to have my ramen fix. The soup base is rich and flavorful. The ramen noodles are done just right. The chasu is thick-cut and roasted, so you have a nice smoky flavor that is pleasantly different from other offerings. The restaurant offers a spicy soup base as well. Just as good as the non-spicy one but only those that can take the heat should try it

My family and I are frequent diners at this restaurant. It has the one of the best pork broth that we have ever tasted. Definitely on par with those we had in Japan. Complete your meal with deep fried chicken and gyoza, and you will be one very satisfied customer who is bound to return. The food there is really that good and is value for money
