Classic Italian food and great service. They have gluten free pasta as well. The only downside is how quiet they are which is surprising given how great the food is. We‚Äôd definitely go back. This restaurant is good for date nights or group dinner.

Go experience yourselfüòò. Will definitely return!!!

Visited Nonna Lina for the 1st time last night. Service was great and food was spectacular. It‚Äôs not cheap but worth every bit of quality. This is the best Italian in SG and one of the best restaurants in town. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough!
5
Great food and good dish size. Raviolis were excellent. Good ingredients come with a price. Well worth it.
4
We took the Lunch menu. Starter with a clear seafood soup which was fantastic. Followed by the main I chosen was salmon and was very well done with great taste. The dessert was tiramisu and I loved it. My sister had the lava cake which I think is second best. Overall nice place to visit and great food. Will try the pizza next time.
5
Really enjoyed all the dishes from appetizers to desserts:D Great dining experience with friends in a cosy n conducive environment for catch up n hearty conversation. I find it's a really welcoming atmosphere and would certainly love to return with friends to try on their other dishes too
5
I love the food and desserts that serves in this restaurabt Though can't remember the menu of them which i always cant ..but the taste of them still deep in my mouth heart. Good ambient too for gathering with friends Oh.. the wines ..wonderful selection for us . Will certainly be back to the restaurant again & agai

I have been to many Italian restaurants in Singapore but this one was hands down the best! You don't need to travel to Florence for Florentine steak, Nonna Lina's Bistecca alla Fiorentina is even better than the ones I had in Florence!! My Friend and I really had an amazing amazing dinner! Grandissimo!
5
Visited this place for the 4th time tonight. Service is always great and food is always spectacular. It‚Äôs not cheap but worth every bit of quality. My friends all agree this is the best Italian in SG and one of the best restaurants in town. Can‚Äôt recommend enough, would say make sure to save room for tiramisu - you‚Äôll like the plate (I did).

I went to the restaurant with high expectations and have had the intention to visit for some years now...finally the day came and I left quite disappointed. Not that the food is bad, but neither was it is very very good - which was what I was expecting, given the reviews and the price you pay. The pasta texture was good, and the tiramisu was really really good - but that was all I can state of the food...sorry...Service wise, nothing to be wow'd about. The Italian's service was lukewarm (there was only one other table occupied) and he seemed more concerned about being behind the counter then at the table, the Asian-looking guy (sorry, I did not get both names) was much more attentive - thank you.Would I return? Probably not, but if I am in the area and craving for Italian, I don't mind giving it another go..
5
I've heard great reviews about this restaurant, and I was not disappointed! The portions are generous and the service was great. The seafood pasta with truffles was out of this world! I enjoyed the meal completely! We were too full to contemplate dessert.
5
We are frequent visitors to this restaurant. The best valued Italian restaurant in town and they do not stop to improve their menu and their culinary presentation of each dish.
4
Surprising tasty and authentic Italian dishes and great service. Worth many visits. Only flip side is the difficulty to get parking.....
5
Welcomed with reservation.
Services are excellent, polite and helpful.
Food are tasty, fresh and well prepared.
Making conversations are good with relaxing atmosphere.
3
I was there fews week ago,had some pasta and starter,was ok,traditional Italian trattoria,if I pass by I'll try again
4
This place will always be my special go-to italian restaurant when i need to bring close friends and food business clients. Cosy, quaint and such good and heartwarming italian meals.
4
The service was great and the chef actually came out to serve the guests whenever he could. Price is quite on the high side but overall, nice food except that the squid ink pasta was more salty than usual for us.
4
Tastes authentic, but the price can be rather steep. Cheese baked eggplant is to die for. Spaghetti was a little hard √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú not sure if undercooked or al dente, hope its the latter. Overall pleasant dining experience though I would only go back if on days I feel richer
5
We came with a friend having not eaten Italian food for several months.As we used to frequent the now closed "In Italy" previously, we didn't know what to expect despite reading reviews.Between the 3 of us, we ordered Parpadelle, Gnocchi and a Risotto.The homemade pappardelle with Italian sausages in creamy gorgonzola sauce was a great start, it was just so easy to eat.Next was the handmade potato dumplings with prawns, clams and pine nuts, this was also a hit as everyone likes seafood and all the flavours combined so well to make this a refreshing pasta dish.The risotto was probably the third ranked of the 3 but was still delicious nevertheless. The Italian name is Risotto al Nero di Seppia - Italian rice with mixed seafood in squid ink and this was worth the black teeth at the end.Would happily return to try the other offerings and it also helped the service was friendly and efficient
5
This is my husband's favorite restaurant that has become my absolute favourite. We make it a point to come here every once or twice a month to reminisce our first dating moments. The food has never failed us especially the bruschetta. THE MUST TRYS ARE:- mushroom and eggplant rissotto, bruschetta, seafood soup (to share), pepperdelle, chicken dish, calamari (to share), PANNACOTTA (musttttt) or the pistachio lava cake fantastic meal. The staff are so friendly and very fast. Despite only being one main chef if i am not wrong we got our food in a reasonable time although during peak. MUST MAKE RESERVATIONS
4
Love the calamari and buffalo cheese with parma ham! Squid ink risotto was nice too! Nice family restaurant, great environment and happy with the service.
5
While in Singapore on a short trip, I found this restaurant and have eaten here three times in 8 days. I haven't eaten Italian food this delicious since visiting Italy several years ago. The food is authentic and not to be missed! If you have room after your main course, try the tiramisu - it's perfect! The staff, chef and owner are very friendly and take the time to come to my table for good conversation. If you haven't been here yet, you've got to try it
5
We came here a week ago with my family and kids. The food was super fantastic that really fulfilled our hungry tummy great ambiance and service which can easily approach....my kids very love the stracchino which they serve with cooked ham! Planning to visit once again soon for the new spag aglio olio with anchovies which is recommended by a good friend can't wait to try that one soon....Forza
3
This Italian restaurant serves Quality Italian food, but pricey with sub-par atmosphere. Do not expect a quiet and romantic place as the place is filled with a loud and noisy crowd. Expect long waiting times for your food, waited ~1 hour before our mains were served
4
Went to Nonna Lina to celebrate a friend's birthday. We had a pretty big group. They were kind to accommodate a cake we brought and served it on a turntable to a birthday song over the sound system. Great surprise! They also served the cake for us. It was a great meal - the eggplant risotto was the best. Bottarga was pretty good too.
5
Came on a wednesday evening with family. The food was excellent, especially the burrata and cartoccio. The trippa (cow stomach) is also fantastic, provided you're a bit more adventurous with your gastronomy!.Service was good too, as long as you respect the food. Will definitely come again
5
We came by on Friday evening and this was totally unexpected. We didn't have a reservation and was half expecting to be turned away but thankfully the guys gave us a small table. It was pretty packed that Friday evening and it did get a little noisy due to the mainly local crowd so it wasn't exactly a romantic date night. We had the lobster linguine and the gnocchi with truffles. Both excellently done. The linguine came with a whole lobster and had so much meat in it. The gnocchi came with a generous amount of shaved truffles and just tasted heavenly. We paired it with a moscato but looking back, a nice sharp Shiraz would have complimented the meal better.Reasonably priced and one of the few places you'll get genuine Italian food that gives you that home made feel to it
4
Unpretentious and classic Italian dishes you will be able to find here. Pasta and the seafood stew are the best in town. No fancy plating, this place just allows for the food to speak for themselves. The kind of food that makes you feel that you can eat it again and again. So if you really don't want to miss the food in this restaurant too much, I would suggest you not come
4
The kitchen is beside so can smell the food cooking before serving. Honestly I don't mind it as it feels like home cook Italian meal which I enjoy very much. But picky people will mind the smell. Hope that the starters are way cheaper but too bad it is right at a high rent place which I understand. Really enjoy the food :
5
The food here is excellent. This small Italian is down to earth. Nothing fancy or pretentious, and it doesn't have to be. The food speaks for itself. The specials included a dish with ham and cheese, soft, milky, full of flavour. And that was just the appetiser. Honest good food.
5
This is my favourite restaurant in Singapore, food was delicious, yummy, good quality, cosy place for gathering or celebrate, the best tenderloin that I always requested & Lobster paste and wine (die die must try ) it's definitely worth it ..
5
seafood or susage pork or steak ; pasta black.squid rice is their signature food ..Dessert and drinks are good quality. Ambience is nice like family setting. overall ..it worth.to.come again
5
I have been to this restaurant several times. Great flavourful italian cuisines without being pretentious. Great service too.
5
If you're looking for something different from the regular Italian fare, this place is for you! Love the lobster linguine and the fish with Parma ham and uni sauce
4
Food is good but I feel it is slightly overpriced. The most overpriced being the desserts. I paid $16 for a small lava cake and it does not even come with ice cream!
5
Very homey atmosphere with terrific food and attentive staff. Despite it being a busy night, the chef came out briefly to chat and ask about our meal. Starters are enormous and delicious - the calamari were more dusted than breaded allowing the flavor to shine through and big enough to share with the table; the mussels and clams in a superb broth with homemade bread are terrific as was a burrata appetizer. The fisherman's soup could be a little soupier but the fish fillet was amazing. The homemade pastas are very authentic. It's a small restaurant but when crowded can be a tad noisy. But it's a lovely place to unwind and settle in with friends; there's no sense of being rushed; the owners want you to feel at home. It's not cheap but the quality of the food is very high so it's good value. With wine and dessert, our table of 6 adults spent around $125 per person
4
We tried Trattoria Nonna for lunch as we were looking for an authentic, homestyle Italian restaurant. From the welcoming reminder text message to the warm service, we felt like guests in someone's home. And to an extent that's what Nonna (Italian for grandmother) is all about. Nonnas own recipes made and served with love in the restaurant. The food was good value with generous serving sizes and very fresh - there don't seem to be any corners being cut in terms of preparation. Fresh crusty bread had good chewiness and the complimentary bruschetta was a well seasoned ripe tomato and EV olive oil fusion. The seafood stew was something you rarely see on menus, and was a hearty mix of mostly shellfish, very tender and fresh in a thick and richly flavoursome napoli sauce. My colleagues were very satisfied with the whole lobster linguine (not for the fainthearted of appetite! ) and the lamb cutlet/sausage combination. The dessert-lover swooned over the home-made tiramisu (again a fairly decent portion) and the cheese selection was adequately sized but would benefit from some Italian hard rind inclusions.The wine list is extensive with a good range from $70 upwards and plenty of Italian as you would expect. The menu overall was very traditional as we hoped, but probably a bit too long - it would benefit from some focus. The specials should be written down or on a blackboard for reference. We will be back, probably to try the $45 set three course which looks like very good value
3
Came here for dinner on Valentine's Day. In general the food was nice, but the service not so good. Service was very slow, I know it's all made fresh but 45 mins to get a piece of bruschetta was a bit excessive especially when it's a set menu. One waitress was good, the other didn't even speak or look at you when bringing food or clearing dishes. Also clearing plates when not everyone has finished eating & leaving dirty cutlery for reuse is a personal pet peeve, and a no no in my book. Expected better after reading the other reviews.
4
Great ambience in a for a special dinner. Great service. Food was very good with large portions. The appetizers are enough for 4 people if you judge from the calamari. In fact, it was too much for just two and priced like an ala carte item. Tomato soup was quite good, but again a large portion. The pasta and risotto were good, as well, again with large portions. While we enjoyed the meal, it really was a heavy price tag for a basically a pasta dinner. I'd go again for a special occasion, but I'm still looking for the good, reasonably priced Italian restaurant in Singapore, it's definitely not Pastamania or Pizza Hut for sure
5
It is my second time here after a while. Had a good impression the first time with its non-prententious food. This time round, the food did not disappoint too. Nonna Lina is all about feeling like you have come home for a delicious meal. Service was great and warm. Can't wait to come again and try what I have not yet
5
I had my best Dinner in Town, me and my wife we were surprised to find a really Italian restaurant in Singapore....thank you for give us a good time we will be back soon
Definitely recommend
5
the finest italian cuisine outside Italy! Food is really good, fresh and well cooked.
Staff is kind and nice!
4
Went to meet my friends for birthday lunch. Staff was attentive and we enjoy ourselves there. Good was excellent and we think the portion for main dish is a little big for ladies.
2
The food was okay, but not great, especially considering the price. In particular, the clams weren't the most fresh, and had bits of shell in them. The service felt rushed. The place generally feels old and a bit run-down.
3
Cosy place. Parmigiana tasted alright but was served almost cold. Lobster pasta tasted good but at $120 was expensive especially when rather small lobster's meat was soft. Total bill for 2 came to$300 without wine.
5
Price is not as same as other casual Italian restaurants but reasonable if you consider quality of each meal. Also highly recommend chocolate ice with coffee:)
5
What can i say, this has become my favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore, overtaking InItaly, which is still very good. The food is unpretentious, delicious, and exactly what you would find in a very good restaurant in Tuscany. This is no holds barred in your face italian flavour and Simone the chef is as friendly as he is talented. This being Singapore, service can be spotty, but chill and enjoy your bottle or 3 of wine and just soak in the flavours. Must orders are the Seafood spaghetti in the bag (Spaghetti Cartoccio), Prawns and Mussels in creamy porcini sauce, Slow cooked Tripe in wine, the rest of teh stuff is good, these are divine
5
I chanced upon this gem years ago when they were still at Craig Road.The food has always been excellent, especially the tomato-based dishes.My friends have always loved the complimentary Bruschetta that I maintain is the tastiest one I've had so far.For starters, I had the clams in white wine reduction and buffalo cheese with parma ham (we gleefully slurped it up).We also shared a pasta (Crab with Penne in tomato sauce) and a mixed grilled seafood.You can taste the quality of the ingredients with each chew, and I would definitely recommend this to my friends.PS We loved the pistachio lava cake, tiramisu and on another occasion, we had the porchetta which was simply heavenly
5
I was in Singapore for a meeting, i need to eat Italian meat, tripadvisor suggests me to go to "Trattoria da Nonna Lina".-When I arrived the staff greeted me like I was one of them.-Really friendly and hospitable!!!!!!Once I seated I was offered a glass of prosecco.-Then i started to choose the dishes:- starter: zuppa del giorno $ 18- first plate: gnocchi allo scoglio $ 42- dessert: torta della mamma $ 16- wine: glass of Chardonnay $ 19To finish the owner offered a good italian coffee and a grappa.-I suggest to taste this restaurant.
2
We went to "Trattoria Nonna Lina" after discovered it from TRIPADVISOR on Sat.13th Aug. 2016. Thanks to good reviews I red, we decided to got dinner dinner there.Expecting a warm hospitality, as usual on "family italian restaurant" (trattoria it's), it was totally opposite feeling. Our feeling were something to be reluctant to serve us at the table. No smiles, no any food/wine suggestion. Maybe the waiter that day doesn't get a good mood.Bohh, could be, but it's always a public place, and being an Italian, this sadden me!No matter on food, really delicous and at level of reviews
4
Was very pleased with the substantial portions of the food served ...although a bit pricey ... Ordered 3 different plates everyone tasted good .. Pleasantly surprised with the Complimentary plate of appetizer .. Overall will surely come again
4
Attentive friendly staff. Very good food. Great place for couples though several families were there as well enjoying the food. Nice neighbourhood feel about the place.
4
Have been to nona lina many times for set lunch. There a good selection in the set lunch menu. Reasonably priced and generous serving. Friendly staff and nice ambience and music. Food is great!
5
The food served is absolutely fantastic. There is no doubt about the authenticity of the taste. The setting and atmosphere is cosy and I love how Italian music is played in the background.
5
Trattoria Nonna Lina does not disappoint. The food was authentic and brought back memories of my time in Italy, the service was spot on and the atmosphere perfect. Definitely a place I would return to to get my Italian food fix.
5
Excellent food and we enjoyed ourselves very much. But we did have a little problem communicating with the staff there.
5
We were a little greedy and had ordered two appetizers followed by main course and dessert. Wanted to eat all but was too full unfortunately. Will order to share next time.
4
We've been coming to Nonna for quite some time and while I'm not usually a pasta guy, I always look forward to having the pastas here. While prices have gone up somewhat, you still get a great meal and affordable wine selection. The entrees are also superb, notably the octopus and calamari.It should also be noted that the restaurant is family run and from time to time you do see snippets of shouting in Italian or some sort of other exchange that lightens the mood a lot. It sort of reminds me of Allo allo almost..
5
This place is so cute and quaint. It's tucked away like a little hidden gem. It kept showing up on TOP Italian restaurants list in Singapore so finally checked it out. Everything was outstanding- the wine, the service, and the food... Oh the food. Our (Italian) server suggested the burrata to start and it was heavenly. He suggested a great Chianti to go along and I made me a vegetarian rissoto with truffle cream that was to die for. Will definitely go back. It's not a cheap meal but worth every penny for the quality and passion that goes into the food and service.
3
Our first visit to this restaurant with casual simple setup.- Great food- Much higher price than expected for a trattoria because pasta pricing almost like some really good Italian restaurants in CBD area.- Service a little too cold for my liking. In this area, the restaurant really lose out because I didn't even see a smile from the Italians throughout the entire meal's service.I contemplated before writing this review because I have saw how the management rebuke the diner's review on Tripadvisor, but decided that a diner is entitle to an opinion of their dining experience and the owners just have to improve on it or if they think they are doing things right then continue being the same way
5
Very happy to enjoy a true tradition, nothing is only dressed Italian, everything is true Italian, you can trust me I am Italian...;-)
5
Restaurant was thoughtful enough to add a candle on their tiramisu. Was a sweet ending to a delicious lunch!
5
A Vibrant cosy restaurant is how I would describe Trattoria Nona Lina. Every dish is prepared with such passion and perfection. (At times you can even hear the chef singing joyfully- in Italian of course).
-Natasha
5
I'm gone to Nonna Lina for a lunch on a saturday of November. I think the best lasagna I have eaten outside Italy! Everything was perfect and the taste of lasagna was amazing!
5
Visited for dinner tonight and is very pleased with the experience! Food is priced slightly higher; but of very good quality. The bruschetta here is out of the world !!! Honestly, it's the best I ever had! Flavorful tomatoes on soft bread and it's complimentary! We kept complimenting it and they gave us another serving on the house (thumbs up for the service!)We had deep fried squid for appetizer, mushroom risotto, rectangular pasta with sea urchin. All very nicely done & tasty!The server was very attentive to us as well. Please keep up the good service!
5
Fantastic food, served elegantly. Every dish we had was superb and generous in size. This is Italian food like my family would serve (yes, we are Italian and started cooking as soon as we could stand!). I highly recommend this restaurant and its superoir staff from chefs to servers
2
We went to Nonna Lina for a family dinner. The food was very good, the ambiance was lacking and did not have the homely Italian trattoria feel. The real disappointment was being charged $11.00 for a glass of milk, along what is a very pricey menu, of below average portion size.. When complaining the manager got very aggressive, stated it was Italian milk, and turned his back on me. We will not retur
5
It's not easy to find a really good Italian restaurant here, especially if you've been to Italy many times. I consider this one of the best and plan to revisit soon. We had the clams and mussels in chilli white wine source, pasta with prawns and fish roe, tenderloin steak, grilled mixed seafood and chocolate cake. All were good, with the seafood dish truly awesome. Service could be improved, and prices were rather high, but the food is worth it.
3
I've been about 3 times and in the past few months prices across the menu were raised ~15%. I'd say with the price increase Nonna Lina is now slightly higher priced than its closest Italian restaurant comparables in its vicinity. Still, the food is very good. They could probably do with another waiter as the restaurant is now quite busy and service was a bit slow on my last visit. Probably won't revisit as I prefer other nearby restaurants
5
Went to this restaurant with my girlfriend on a Saturday for lunch with no expectations whatsoever. We live close by and passed many times next to it so we decided to give it a shot. First impression is that the prices are definitely not cheap which made us hesitate whether we were about to have a great meal or just a fancy fine dining meal. The interior decor and service made us feel welcome though and the complimentary bruscheta was delicious so that already made us think we had chosen wisely. We had the Italian cured meats and cheeses and the deep fried calamari as starters, both incredible. It got then better with the pasta dishes we had for main courses, she chose the linguine with seafood and I had tagliatelle with Italian sausage and gorgonzola. These were out of this world. Feeling complete full we thought about skipping desert however we could not go away without trying a tiramisu, and that was up to the standard of the whole meal. Absolutely incredible. I agree with several reviewers that you cannot find Italian food like this except in Italy. Definitely a place to go back
5
Delicious, authentic italian food, fresh generous serving. The pastas, risottos and seafood items are delicious. The dessert is a must. I will return to try the meat dishes next time. Service is warm and hospitable.
4
lovely italian family restaurant in a cosy setting. nice honest italian food but be prepared to wait for your meal.
5
Authentic Italian food with fast service & decent portion. Strongly recommend to try the Lamb cutlets & crab meat penne pasta. A little out of the way but definitely a hidden gem worth checking out
3
My husband and I decided to celebrate our six months wedding anniversary here after reading wonderful reviews. Our expectations were quite high after reading them! The decor is very comforting and homely and the staff is courteous. I loved the complimentary bruschetta. I thought it was quite delicious and very well seasoned. A good bruschetta is something you don't get in a lot of Italian restaurants. For entr√É¬©e we had parmigiana which is the baked eggplant dish. It was quite good. The main course was a bit disappointing. My husband had the lamb rack with veggies while I had pesto pasta. Nothing great there; average dishes. For dessert we shared the chocolate and rum pudding which is so famous. Thought it was a bit overhyped, it was ok but nothing out of the world. The cake and chocolate sauce on the side were good. The taste of rum a bit overpowering. So overall I would say we went with very high expectations, but the experience was average for the price
5
I lived in Italy for 10 years and was proud to have the ability to try most of the top restaurants in Rome and many other cities in Italy.Rest assured that in none of those restaurants was i able to eat such remarkable food as i do at Nonna Lina. It is almost the case of having to fly out of Italy, into Singapore to eat truly authentic Italian food.The attention to detail, quality and freshness of the food goes to an almost maniacal level and that can be tasted from the first bite!The atmosphere is excellent and the family really makes you feel like you are in Italy.I have tried most of their dishes and not once was i disappointing, instead i always feel sorry when i am about to have my last bite.I have brought along many friends / coworkers from all over the globe and everyone just adores the food and the environment created by this family.I consider myself very peculiar when it comes to food, but Nonna Lina definitely deserves the top mark as it is very rare to find a place that can deliver such high quality food regardless of what your order is. 5 star Restaurant
4
We had a wonderful dinner at Nonna Lina. The most incredible dish was the grilled meat, soaked for 36 hours. It was the most tender meat I have ever eaten. The homemade pasta was also extremely good. The salad was ok. We will definitely come back here again.All of the staff is Italian, so expect Italian style service. They will not come to you until you ask, as they wouldn't disturb you. But they are very attentive when you look to them. They are always watching for a signal from you. It would be very rude in Italy for the staff to push you along in your meal
5
Love the risotto here! The chef takes special orders very seriously, and I've had quite a few risotto variations that are not on the menu. Whichever risotto I've had is always flavorful, and the al dente rice is perfectly chewy each time. The chocolate pudding with rum is a must have, it's the final climax to a wonderful meal! It's rich and practically orgasmic, and I've never come across another chocolate dessert quite like it elsewhere. If sharing desserts with friends, I also make sure we have tiramisu since it's so Italian, and Nonna Lina's version is quite authentic. Apart from the food, i think the place is pretty special. I feel the passion that Chef Simone has for his food, and that makes the food special. Eg plenty of places do a decent tiramisu, but just the chef's personality makes it extra special because it's made with care. And that's the uniqueness to their dishes. The trattoria also has a family atmosphere that makes me happy. Being greeted warmly, coupled with great food... dining there makes for a great experience each time
5
Love this place for the warm family running the restaurant and the fantastic Italian food! It's our go to place when we want to have some authentic Italian without traveling to Italy! Eggplant parmigiana, baby octopus with mushrooms, seafood pasta for two, penne with crab meat , squid ink pasta are just a few of our favorite orders. Will keep coming back!
3
Went here after reading the excellent reviews.The complimentary brushetta was excellent but the food went downhill from there. The filet of fish was drowned by the arabiata sauce, the tenderloin size must have been the smallest i have come across - about 120gm for over $50ph. In addition the Tiramisu lacked any coffee flavour - when we complained we were told that we were the only people who didn't like it - so much for feedback. Will not visit agai
3
We went here after seeing a 94% rating, the entrees were quite dismal so we ended up just eating bread, but were offered complimentary bruschetta (the smallest but nicest!) the mains were expensive and very very small, and the most of the pasta dishes had sausage in them which was fine but instead came out like gritty mince. The pasta was nice though. Good service as well but probably wouldn't go back
5
The best Italian food in the city. Family service, we enjoyed all the time the night there. I recommend and if course I can't wait back for my Italian pasta.
5
Fantastic tuscany food style... Delicious is the right word to be used to describe dushes... I suggest to try 'pappardelle' ed 'zuppetta argentarina', confortable site and fantastic habitat...Chief on Top Ten
5
In a tiny city where new restaurants are constantly sprouting out, Trattoria Nonna Lina stands out way above the rest and here's why, it is a family style restsurant that's manned by an Italian family so the food doesn't get more genuine than this. Unlike most restaurants that pay more attention to the decor and furnishings, this place is all about good hearty Italian fare.Two had set lunches and it costs $40 for a starter, a pasta dish, desert and a beer or a glass of wine. The portions are good sized so you're guaranteed to want to put on some loose clothes. I'm definitely coming back for more
5
I went to the restaurant when i was in Singapore and i've been surprised of how it felt like home!!!The food is delicious. The homemade pasta was special and I'm italian so I can tell!!Service was great and they are nice and friendly.I'll definitely going back while in town
3
Passed by the restaurant on my way back home. Felt sorry for them as they were opened but no customers.Went in to try them out, ordered appetizers all through to the desserts! The wine was bad and the food too salty. Indication of that is it has been prepared and stored in freezer for awhile so not freshly cooked..Never going there again
4
Trattoria Nonna Lina is like the family restaurants you come across in Italy...except that it's at Cantonment Road in Singapore's Chinatown. Simone is the chef along with his mum. Dad & brother Francesco work the front of the house. It's clearly a family affair. Even their friends come along to chat and help out.I ate there on a Friday evening with an Italian friend who attested to the authenticity of the dishes, which I would consider as classics. For starters, we shared a carpaccio as well as a dish of clams & mussels. The carpaccio was thin slices of beef atop some rocket with shavings of parmigiano & some funghi. The flavours were excellent but I have to say the shellfish in their tasty broth took our breath away - slightly hot with the addition of chilli, the natural clam & mussel juices, wine & lemon - this dish made us finish all the bread that came with it, mopping all up. Oh, and I should mention that there was a delicious bruschetta that was served before our dinner that was absolutely lovely. A great introduction to the meal to come.We opted for pasta as a main - the spaghetti al bottarga as well as the tagliatelle al ragu. My personal favourite was the pasta with prawns and bottarga, which is dried mullet roe but my companion gave me some of his tagliatelle to try & I was in love with it as well. Both excellent choices.Of course we couldn't leave without trying the desserts, especially the chocolate and rum pudding. This was recommended by a friend who visited a week ago. And she wasn't wrong either as it was smooth & contained a nice amount of rum. A must if you are a chocoholic as I was. Sharing a dessert didn't make it too indulgent but we did opt for a second dessert, the torta di mamma or "mother's cake". Nonna Lina's version had a molten centre of pistachios, flavoured with amaretto.I highly recommend that you visit Trattoria Nonna Lina if you want an authentic Italian experience with some of the best food you'll ever eat. Treat yourself. You will not regret it. We will definitely be back soon as there was so much on the menu we hadn't tried yet such as the roast pork or porchetta

we came here based on a friend's reference. it was a great decision. the family run restaurant has one of the best services I came across. they were accommodating and friendly, and made my business partners felt really welcome. the food was fantastic. the pasta bottarga and the pasta with pesto sauce were done very well, and that to me is an indicator of good Italian cooking. meats did not disappoint but what I liked was that when they came out with bruschetta before we even ordered any food. and with dessert, they treated us to limoncello. in a world where restaurants frown on their customers sharing dishes or desserts, I thought this act of generousity was rare and it was much appreciated by us. we are going back, for the next conference dinner

I am always on the lookout for places that serve good Italian food, as its my family's favourite cuisine and the kids always eat their food without much hassle, when we have Italian.I had come across this restaurant recently and brought a colleague here for lunch.Its set in a restored shophouse that faces the Police Cantonment Complex. Parking is also convenient, where you can park at Pinnacle on Duxton and walk over.The restaurant was half full for Monday lunch, which augurs well for the restaurant.Here are the highlights of our meal:Starters- Bruschetta - Complimentary dish. The tomatoes were fresh and chopped up and served atop focaccia bread. Bread was crunchy and tomato topping were yummy.- Zuppetta Argentarina: $25. Mussels and cut prawns stewed in a creamy porcini sauce & served with focaccia bread slices. The seafood were fresh and the gravy went well with the bread. Delicious.- Tagliata al Tartufo: $34. Grilled premium tenderloin with truffle sauce. Beef were nicely grilled to medium, sliced & served on a wooden board. The whiff of truffle oil stimulates my taste buds and beef lovers will like this.- Parmigiana: $23. Eggplant layers baked with Mozarella and homemade tomato sauce, then topped with Parmesan. Best eaten when its served to your table as you can enjoy the freshly baked and hot! My colleague loved this. - Carpaccio Di Manzo: $24. Bed of salad, topped with finely-sliced raw beef, porcini mushroom dressing & truffle oil. The beef has to be fresh, else it can‚Äôt be eaten raw. Mains- Pappardelle della Vigna: $28. Homemade pappardelle with homemade Italian sausages in a creamy Gorgonzola sauce. The noodles were handmade and soft. The sauce is blue cheese based, and may be strong for some. Sausage was also good. Nice. - Penne al Granchio: $28. Penne with fresh crab meat in a creamy tomato sauce. The penne was al dente. And the crab meat sauce coats the penne well to give flavour to every bite. Good!Thus far, I have tried 3 of their pastas and they have all been good. Looking forward to trying other pastas when I visit again.Desserts- Bonet Argentarino: $16. Traditional homemade Italian chocolate and rum pudding with home-made caramel sauce. A very rich and delicious dessert. The caramel sauce complements the pudding well. The cocoa powder used is good grade and added flavour to each mouthful. This was a unique dessert that I have not tried anywhere else. Must-order!The restaurant has an Ospitalit√† Italiana seal awarded by the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Singapore. It's one of only five Italian restaurants in Singapore to have this award that marks a recognition for authentic representation of the Italian culture outside Italy. Recommended

This Italian restaurant was previously on Craig Road and shifted to their new premises 3 months ago. They are now located directly oppositely Police Cantonment Complex and easily accessible by MRT if you are travelling by public transport.The restuarant is able to seat about 30 pax, has a high ceiling with warm lighting and is cosy.I came by this restaurant for lunch and had their Prawn and Clam Pasta with Italian Fish Roe. It was served in a unique herring-bone shaped plate. The noodles were al dente and has a good bite. The cut prawns and clams gave a natural sweetness and natural flavour to the pasta dish. The sauce was also unique. I tasted minced pork and dried shrimp with each mouthful. Overall, the dish was delicious. In the front of the restaurant is a plaque that is issued by the Italian embassy that certifies that produce used in the restuarant is 100% Italian. A mark of confidence.After dining here, I can say that the food quallity is there and I will be back here soon enough.Recommended

a very good food and value for money meal in a very authentic italian restaurant. however i got taken back from the decor of the restaurant as it is really making you don't want to go in into the restaurant. i feel they should make changes into their interior to attract customer to go i

We had a delicious dinner, accompanied with nice wine, served by the owners who are passionately involved in every activity. Chef is Italian, excellent skills with sauces and desserts. Reasonable prices. Will come back.

We arrived for dinner at 6:00 p.m. We were the only two people in the restaurant. Aside from the initial drink order we placed upon arrival, we were virtually ignored by the staff. By 6:50 p.m. no one had asked if we wanted to order dinner or wine, so we paid and had dinner somewhere else

I have a very high standard for italian food as I used to eat home cooked italian meals. However, I do take it into account where I am. What I cannot tolerate is terrible SERVICE - the food was good but the service just ruined it for me. I do not care if you are the greatest chef in the business but if the service is bad, I cannot give you a valid rating for goodness - the two men in the restaurants on Friday night the 18th were simply rude, impatient and rather condescending about specific questions on the menu. My glass of Sangiovese was placed on the table rather abruptly, luckily it did not spill

What to say, the place is very well decorated, typical Italian style. All the staff is kind and helpful, is all manage by a family, very very friendly. Simone, the chef, is a great, i let him prepare as he wish and i ate fantastically. I will definitely go back soon

I shared a meal with some friends in this friendly and well presented family restaurant in a great central location. The service was quick but genuinely helpful. We were presented with a great selection of starters from the mussels in porcini sauce to the platter of deli meats and home made lamb sausages. The mains were a great size and delicious. Wine list was full of Tuscan specials we ordered a nice full bodied chianti, about average price. The main thing I remember is the friendly family feel. I travel frequently for business and it had a welcoming vibe which you want to go back to. The boss is SImone and the place is run by his family

We stumbled across this restaurant near Chinatown and enjoyed it as a nice change from Asian food. The food was authentic Tuscan and delicious. I had risotto and my wife had a papardelle beef dish and with nice fresh mozzarella and Parma ham to start. Good though expensive wine list and overall pretty expensive even at Australian standards but friendly and a nice atmosphere

if you want no frill, simple, but really good genuine italian food... this is the place to go. unlike many overrated italian restaurants throughout south east asia here you can find food that is very very near what you can find in Italy.it is a family run place, and it shows. as good as at home !the food is fresh and tasty. we were a large group and therefore had a chance to try and share many dishes, may be 10 or 15. most of them were very good or excellent. among them the parpadelle al ragu and the lamb sausage with lentils. the owner has great italian wines to recommend.the service is family style. relaxed and unhurried.the decor is a bit bland, but you don't come for that.enjoy the food there

We have been to this restaurant twice in 3 days. Expat friends in Singapore took us on the first night and we loved it so much we had to go one last time before we flew back to HK. The family are so nice; the food fresh and authentic. A nice mix of the informality of Singapore combined with the love both Singaporean's and Italian's have for family dinners as the place was busy with family celebration

Homely Italian fare from Milano area of Italy served by this caring Italian family who proudly fly in all their ingredients from Italy & serve the most authentic fare you can ask for, in a relaxed unhurried fashion! Great for families too! A must visit if you value 'Authenticity'
