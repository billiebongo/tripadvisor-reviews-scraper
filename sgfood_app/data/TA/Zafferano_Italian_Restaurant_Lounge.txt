The food is delicious, the service is friendly and professional on the same time, and the view on the marina is spectacular.
Been there 2 times so far, with friends and family and planning to come again.

i love the food there. Easy to get reservations booked. fuss free through the website
The service is excellent and friendly, the atmosphere cosy and welcoming. The cook deserves a star for the tasty food, without a long wait between courses.

Beautiful location nice view Italian restaurant,,service and food everage for this price a lot choose in Singapore,
3
the views from the top floor was great undoubtedly, but the food was just mediocre for the price you are paying.

Came here with mum, she had the lamb rack and omg it was cooked to purfection. The meat was so tender and full of flavor, while I had the house made fettuccine, seasonal yellow chanterelle mushrooms, truffle emulsion which was also very nice too, you can tell the pasta was house made and not store bought. We both left feeling very full and was unable to try dessert. Service was very good. It is a bit pricy but very worth it
3
Visited the restaurant on V day. Standard V day menu was available. At that price, one would have thought the standard will have been quite good given the kitchen only produces the same set of dishes. Sad to say, only the dessert portion were memorable. The rest of the 4 courses were only average at best. Good ingredients were used, service was attentive, restaurant decor was average but comes with good view.
5
Zafferano has an outside bar area where you can also get fingerfood but not a full dinner. The outside area is open on top but there are high window walls making it not a classical rooftop bar rather being more enclosed.Dinner was inside with reasonable views but not the best of Singapore. The food was excellent. There is a wide choice in excellent Italian wines, both by the bottle and by the glass

Located at high level of ocean financial tower, the restaurant which is located at the 43rd floor has a breathtaking view of marine bay sand and the city. I was there for a business dinner and we had the dinner set menu.We started off the dinner with Capesanta – Arancia – Melograno – Caviale; Hokkaido scallop ‘carpaccio’ with orange and pomegranate & Kristal gold caviar that I think very good and refreshing. This is followed by Jumbo prawn calamarata’ pasta in Sicilian ‘pesto'. The pasta was just average to my liking. For the mains, I chose the Black Angus Beef Tenderloin and the steak is tender & juicy; with subtle celery root puree and veal reduction (as stated in the menu ). The dessert was good too. In term of price, probably a bit pricey. Overall, good food, great service and amazing view

Lovely food, great service, phenomenal view of Singapore with an outside terrace where you can have a drink before and/or after food. Definitely worth a visit.It felt a bit pricey but I don't live in Singapore, so I wouldn't be a good judge as I can't benchmark it against similar restaurants in the city. The main reason why it's not getting an "excellent" instead of a "very good" is because 3 out of 4 mains were lukewarm rather than hot when served, which is quite a beginner's mistake a high-end restaurant should not make.Would still go again

It was my first experience with Zafferano and it was somewhat not up to my expectations but there’s always a chance to improve! Dined at the restaurant with my date and we both ordered the degustation menu of 4 course for SGD98++ and it’s very worth it!I’ve picked the fegato grosso from the antipasti, agnolotti from primi, manzo from secondi and cioccolato cilliegie from dessert. My partner picked capasante, agnolotti, agnello and miele.Food : I really love how the fegato was prepared as it didn’t taste any strong foie gras taste and I love the combination of everything on the plate! The agnolotti was the best of all! I really love it so much of the pistachios that was toasted just right and goes so well with the celeriac purée and the agnolotti! It was marvellous and I’ll strongly recommend everyone to try that! As for the manzo and cioccolato cilliegie I was very disappointed. First for the manzo, it was not as soft as I was expecting it to be as it stated that it was sous vide for 48 hours. Sadly it turns out to be harder and it wasn’t very flavourful. I can hardly tasted the veal sauce and the flavours from the beef. As for the dessert, it was far from good and average. I’m a big fan of chocolates and have been using Valrhona for my chocolates bonbon but I really don’t taste the 70% richness of the chocolates and it was very sweet. Didn’t really taste any bitterness from the chocolates but it was very soft and smooth. I wasn’t able to finish up as it was too sweet for me to bottom up. Service : I truly enjoyed a lot of the services from the team as there was a lady in blazer with short neatly groomed hair that entertained our night there. It was an unexpected rainy cold evening and she offered me a piece of scarf to cover and warm me throughout the evening. But the overall service from the team was excellent! Keep it up!Overall experience I would rate it as very good. I am sure that I’ll be back soon and do be recommending my friends to try out! And I looked forward for a better improvement!

Excellent service, surprised my friend with a birthday dessert. The lobster bisque was delicious and so was the branzino.

Located at high level of ocean financial tower. It has a breathtaking view of marine bay sand. We enjoyed the food and the service was good
5
Beautiful place. Tastefully decorated. Amazing views of Marina Bay and business areas. Food delicious. Beautifully presented. Delicious desserts

Dining at Zafferano is always a treat. Guests are well taken care of.. and food is delicious and hearty.. and the place comes with a fantastic view.
5
Zafferano terrace Lounge has amazing views but more importantly it has great Staff. Kumar and Ian and their team take great care of all the clients and Make you feel welcome. Good music and a nice DJ open to requests and food is great too.. Highly recommend Ladies night on Thursdays. Love this place.

We went for a business meeting for lunch. The view is nice. Food taste is pretty average for the price you pay. Service was quite lousy with delays in taking order to serving food. I would avoid going here again.

My girlfriend has bring me to this restaurant to celebrate my birthday. This restaurant is located within the ocean financial centre at level 43, the location is good as it is located near to Raffles Place Mrt. There is a reception at the lobby to receive you and call the lift for you. The restaurant setting is good and romantic, cos we have some bags with us and they offered to store it at their counter and collect it after our dinner. There is an outdoor bar but it is raining, we managed to take some photos which oversee the amazing Singapore skyscraper, just wonderful. The waiter and waitress are all very warming and friendly. Food served is a bit slow though but the good food worth all the wait. Well worth the price for the view and its taste. There is complimentary birthday cake served to us and the staff has helped us taken a lot of beautiful photos. Highly recommended to visit

With a breathtaking view of the Marina Bay waterfront, Zafferano had a fantastic ambience and was beautifully decorated. Service was excellent and the staff were very polite and friendly.Our foie gras starter was amazing - rich and slightly crispy, and well-balanced with a layer of dark chocolate - quite an ingenious combination! For mains, we had tender beef short ribs and succulent sea bass. Dessert was the perfect finish - the chocolate mousse with cherry yogurt was heavenly! Zafferano's desserts truly lived up to its reputation! The wine collection was also very impressive.It was also a special occasion for us as this was where I proposed to my now-fiancée. The staff were amazingly creative and meticulously helped to set up our table. We had an unforgettable night and Zafferano is definitely a great place for special events
5
Went with a friend to celebrate year-end. First time there. Too bad it was raining rather heavily so we were seated indoor, otherwise we would have chosen a seat close to the window for a good city view. We ordered the 4-course dinner. My selection: ranate, (2) house-made 'fettuccine', seasonal yellow 'chanterelle' mushrooms truffle emulsion, (3) 48 hours sous-vide and roasted US prime beef short ribs glazed chestnuts and artichokes, veal reduction, and (4) 70% Valrhona chocolate mousse, cherry yogurt cremeux, sous-vide green apple.My companion's choices: (1) Rougie foie gras, apple compote, 70% Valrhona dark chocolate fresh raspberry, (2) 'super fina Carnaroli Acquerello' risotto from 'Vercelli' squid ink, sauteed calamari, broccoli puree, (3) 150 days grain fed Black Angus beef tenderloin, broccoli 'Romanesco' celery root puree, veal reduction, and (4) modern syphon tiramisu, mascarpone cream scented with Marsala wine.Artfully presented, each dish is simply a joy with its perfect blend of ingredients. Good ambience and friendly service. An enjoyable dinner indeed

What a fantastic day! Chef Marco Guccio, Restaurant Manager Paolo Colzani, and all of the staff provided a Christmas feast with out compare! The Entrée’s were delectable, live seasonable oysters, Italian ‘burrata’, 24 month ‘Pio Tostini’ ham, mortadella to die for! Followed by a fried fresh seafood platter including calamari, prawns, cocktail mayo and baby lobster. Then there were various delightful paste’s served at the table and a traditional carving station. The turkey was moist and absolutely delicious. We also were presented Australian Ref Snapper, which was absolutely delectable. The desert menu was to die for! They had everything that will kill you slowly with a smile on your face!All in all we have been coming to Zafferano’s for two years now, normally they are fantastic today they were stupendous. Thank you for a absolutely wonderful Christmas day. This is not a once off, for Zafferano’s everyday is Christmas Day
5
The view is splendid (esp., in the night). The food is top notch (starters and seconds) and the desserts are perfect (esp., the tiramisu and pina cota)... :)
5
Nice experience. Food was great. Recommend excellent Italian cuisine. Everything that I ordered very much.
5
We went there for our 3rd wedding anniversary, the foods were awesome. Dining ambience was great. The staffs are friendly. Cocktail are awesome! Look for Kumar for great cocktails, you will definitely love it =).
5
We visited Zafferano for the first time for a birthday party, and we truly liked it! Great food, fresh and delicious, good selection of wines, relaxed ambience of the place, stunning views of Marina Bay, and a really warm and friendly service made our evening very enjoyable. Weâ€™ll be back soon!

Excited for this visit, was looking forward to try the food, to enjoy the view and to celebrate my birthday with best friend.We were given a table, and checked with the staff if we can sit two tables away from assigned seat, she let us sit with not happy face.One of the lady staff (with very short hair) aproached us if we need any assistance for the menu...she was the best and most professional staff ever in the restaurant.The rest of the staff services were like those in the casual dining restaurant, the way they talk and serve us. It could be more formal and professional.The only good thing we ordered one pasta to share, they put effort to separate into 2 plates for us.After that, we have waited almost 45 mins for our next meal, sous vide chicken. After we asked then the staff went to check with kitchen, only to find out that the chicken was burned, the staff mentioned that chefs had to ensure the food is good quality then they will serve. So we just waited. While we were having our chicken, staff almost clear the main plate still with sauces. He didn't even say sorry and just walked away.There are few staff serving our table, at least 4 staff, usually there is allocation for each staff to serve certain table.Dessert was served without candle even we did indicate in chope this is to celebrate birthday (we were not asking for complimentary dessert).Hope the service will improve for fine dining restaurant like zafferano with good food and nice restaurant atmosphere

After pleasant experience in the past (last year's Christmas dinner was very nice), the visit we paid on Friday was truly disappoining, in many ways. The table set up was not as requested and awkward (two large 4-seater tables joined for 2 couples) so we asked for other seating; the service was at best mediocre and less attentive all night (generally very hurried and a plate was bluntly put on top of resting hand of my wife) and a very sparse offering of bland bread; the foods were uninspiring (the gnocchi were good but who thought about a sweet raspberry sauce for this starter/primi? yuk), the atlantic cod at SGD58++ was left in oven just 2 minutes too long and was surrounded by a few veggies for decoration - the artichoke was cold and straight from the can it seemed. The most shocking experience was the tiramisu desert: a defrosted and watery mess, we couldn't believe it and did not finish it. Not sure what happened but this was not in line with past visits. For over 320 Singapore dollar per couple you would hope for something much better. Will not return within the next two years

Recommended for a business lunch by locals, and I agree with their assessment: solid place to lunch when in the area. Enjoyed the lunch, service and particularly the views. Prices on par with Singapore these days--which is to say it's no bargain--but that's the way it is in go go S'pore
5
This is a must go place! Hardly you can find a place with beautiful view, excellent food and friendly service. Thanks to all the staff Chona from the restaurant, Zaf from the terrace and the management of Zafferano for such a wonderful place! We will definitely return... looking forward to more awe
1
I've noticed the ambience in this place has somewhat subdued; and I think I can see why. Want to start by saying this has been my go to client lunch venue for years, but my last two visits I've found the portions questionable. Whilst the plate looks fancy and artistic, this is just a thin slice of pork belly on a whimpy dollop of creamed something or other ... very insufficient for the price paid, even though it was a set menu item; first time ever the starter salad was more adequate than the main dish. Whilst I felt robbed of my lunch, the real shock hit me when the waiter not once, but TWICE opened a bottle of water without asking us... at $10 a pop, I just found it a bit cheeky and annoying the waiter would take it upon himself to order our drinks.
5
Came here for the first time on my birthday. the food and service was impeccable. most amazing truffle pasta i have ever had and the staff was the sweetest. they overheard my conversation over the phone when someone was wishing me happy birthday and they surprised me with a birthday cake on the house! no regrets, kudos to the team for being perfect.
5
The restaurant has a great view over marina bay and is classy establishment all round. There are various options to try a variety of dishes which are actually good value. Obviously it’s not cheap but we’ll worth it overall.
5
Zafferano has a lovely ambiance, with dedicated and attentive waiters. Thank you for the great dinner and will be back!

Sea bass was too salty and minestrone was below average. Dessert was nice. As it was a business, the environment was too noisy for conversation.
4
We had visited this restaurant for a milestone birthday celebration. The food was excellent and the service superb. Nothing could be faulted. Would definitely visit again.
5
Great ambience - love the panoramic view when having our pre-dinner drinks outdoor. Food was good and not forgetting their excellent customer service. Would definitely go back again!
4
Been here a couple of times but this was the first time I actually had a “full” dinner here.The quality of the food was definitely there. The Quantity, no where close!Dinner for 5 was close to a thousand dollars, and I gotta say my slow cooked short ribs were yummy, but absolutely the most expensive two and a half cubic inches of beef I have ever had in my life.The guys who ate the lamb rack did okay, as there was a decent serving, but the ravioli, and the fettucini were also microsopic
4
Had a truffle pizza with wine and prosecco, coupled with a beautiful view of the city, albeit through high glass windows. It was comfortable to get a table and seats nearer the windows so as to get unobstructed views of MBS and the lightship on the bay. May be a little warm on some hotter days though so the huge fans provided some respite! Overall a pleasant night out
5
Visited this place almost weekly for several months, and would definitely visit again! Amazing view, excellent food, great wine, nice relaxed atmosphere. The staff are very courteous and the management is super friendly. Would be my first recommendation if anyone asks for a place to have dinner
1
Save your money for lots of other amazing restaurants with beautiful views around Singapore. The food was below average, tiny portions and way overpriced. The service was slow and unaccomodating. The restaurant was nearly empty, yet our dinner took 3 hours and we even had to depart without having our last course. Staff were rushing around and complaining to us about the demands they were under in an empty restaurant. We arrived early for drinks on the terrace, which was empty and were told we couldn't sit in certain seats with great views because they were being held for a party arriving 2 hours later. We were drinking $20 cocktails. Overall save yourself the hassle and expense and AVOID!! Was very cold inside restaurant, as well. Servers knew nothing about the wine selection - couldn't recommend or even suggest
4
This is a nice lil nuggest hidden in CBD, in Raffles Place itself. Has the requisite sky bar for chilled evening drinks fronting the restaurant which looks like it will charge an arm (it's reasonable I feel). Certainly a place to impress a date. Or a business associate. Both types were plenty present the evening we were there. We had canapes and drinks before our meal - the little cones of fish and foie gras tarts (yes, yes, judge away!) were yummeh. The meal itself - the soup was hearty, scallops showed finesse and the stuffed raviaoli was a to-return-for dish. Dessert was their signature tiramisu and maybe we were stuffed but it was just okay. Can forgive given the overall experience. Will return
5
Super atmosphere, good food although the portions were large. Great for a celebratory meal, and very child friendly.
5
AMAZING service and the food was really on point. We got the la degustazione set (4 course) and was very pleased that we got to try a whole variety of food. The cod and steaks were done GREAT!
5
Love the place. Cozy and romantic ambience. Food is good.. service is perfect. Its a little quiet when i am there. Overall..
5
I have been to Zafferano's many times for business lunches - they have a great set lunch menu and the staff are very attentive and friendly.The food is delicious and the portion sizes are just right to have a nice lunch and not end up in a food coma after when you have to go back to work
4
Another restaurant with a great view but with a menu and service to back it up. The food is delicious try the 4 course meal absolutely brilliant. the wine is always good and priced for everyone. The service is just delightful with just enough attention that you remember you are in a restaurant. Give it a try. Enjoy
4
First time visit to this place. Nice place with a good view of the marina bay financial district and bay area. Realised that at 43 level of the Ocean Financial Centre, it was slightly higher that the Marina Bay Sands sky bridge. We tried the 3 course set lunch and also some oysters. The food was average. The service staff was friendly and responsive. One of us in the group was seated near the air-condition vents overhead and said that she felt cold. A female service staff noticed that and became aware of the situation and while we started our lunch, she came back with a shawl and offered it to the guest. Wow,, this is great service and customer sensitivity! Kudos to the staff and the restaurant for this "just when you needed it /and only if you had it" item.The other take aways was the moment that one of the managers (a suited up caucasian) came to our table with bill when we were still in the middle of our main course. Wrong table! We were all so surprised by the sudden visit. Sigh. We are all embarrassed
5
I was fortunate to go to this fabulous establishment on a trip to Singapore. The staff were exceptional, both professional & attentive. We had an amazing night, thanks Roza. I would not hesitate to recommend the lounge/terrace for ladies night on a Thursday, beautiful view. Enjoy if you get chance to go..
5
This place has to be one of the highest restaurants in Singapore . The view is marvelous but you need to ask for seats close to the windows so book in advance. Food wise we really liked the foie gras and the pastas are nice though the portions aren't really big. It's also kinda pricey so be prepared to spend a little
5
It was a total wonderful dining experience. Right from the start in the reservation, the hostess who took my reservation has noted & see to the details. From the arrival in the restaurant, everyone makes you feel very welcome & personable, especially Ms Mia & the restaurant manager Mr Pablo Colzani . The cooking is exquisite and we will definitely add Zafferano as one of our favourite dining destination. It's a great team, well done & keep it up. Thank you for a happy evening at Zafferano
5
Sitting on top of Ocean Financial Centre in Raffles Place means this place has fantastic views. You must book early if you want a window seat then. Lunchtime crowd is a good mix of office groups, small business meeting groups and the ubiquitous ladies who lunch. We took the set lunch option which was very good, soup was hot and very Italian. Main courses are a good size but you need to order sides if you want them, such as potato or mushroom and other vegetables as the plate is shall we say minimalist. Coffee was excellent, Good place for a friendly business meeting, staff very attentive but not obtrusive. Overall good value
3
Come here for a drink at least, and maybe dinner afterwards. One of the best views in town. The food was quite reasonable in the restaurant. Good for large groups.
5
No words can describe the night I had with my sister! We partied on top of the world!! Great music by an awesome deejay Xman Gee - icing on the cake for a great night out!!

At as a couple on a Saturday night.On arrival we asked to have drinks on the terrace before dinner. We were shown to a nice table close to the edge and were served promptly. Espresso martini was good. However, the outdoor area music was very loud - so loud that you could not talk/hear. Is the terrace a bar or a club? The table next to us had chosen to eat outside and asked if they could turn the music down. The request was refused (albeit politely)Once inside we were given a nice window seat. For a Saturday night the restaurant was very quiet. Probably only 4-5 other tables. It's also very cold. The new menu has a good selection. The starter of the ceviche was excellent. The beef carpaccio was still slightly frozen in the centre so either your fridge is too cold or you keep it frozen and thaw before serving... either way - not great.The mains: sous vide chicken was good. The scampi (at $65) was a little disappointing - the meat itself was excellent but for the price I'd expect some accompaniment/sauce. Sides on the menu didn't seem very inspiring - more effort required there if the mains are just protein.Service was good throughout the evening. However, being seated next to the window we were looking over the terrace/night club outside with the window reverberating (due to the extremely loud music) throughout the evening. It was quite odd for a high end restaurant.I would suggest that you make a decision - you are either a club or, a high end restaurant with a pleasant bar/terrace. Trying to be both is alienating.Note: Artemis Grill has a similar location/view/price point - if I had to choose - I'd go there

We booked a table at Zafferano for 2 on National Day, stating explicitly that it was a birthday that we were commemorating.THE GOODPrior to our arrival, I liaised with Jennifer, who was absolutely wonderful and made great arrangements for a customised bouquet of my choice to be sent to the restaurant on the day before. That went off without a hitch and I was genuinely pleased with her service. Thanks Jennifer, you were awesome!The food was nothing short of excellent. We went to Zafferano with the knowledge that it was included in the 2017 Michelin Guide Singapore. Even with our heightened expectations, we were pretty much bowled over with the National Day set menu. The Hokkaido scallop tartare antipasti was a complete treat, as was the pumpkin gnocchi. It was completely amazing and we couldn't ask for more for our taste buds.Atmosphere was great and the view from Level 43 was breathtaking.However, that does not overshadow the shortcoming that we experienced:THE BADWe were seated promptly by Jennifer. However, we were left to our own devices for the next full 10 minutes, with no one attending to us. Eye contact with nearby service professionals were ignored and we had to raise a hand for someone to supply us the National Day set menu. After that, we were in for another 10 minutes of waiting. We had to raise a hand for another staff to take our orders. We would have accepted this if we had to decide on what to eat, but the only choice we had to make was a choice of mains (out of 2). We hardly required a solid 10 minutes.That was 20 minutes of substantial waiting, with our stomachs growling. No water was served either until the 20-minute mark.To be fair, the service professionals were perfectly pleasant on an individual level and we genuinely enjoyed talking to them (when we caught them). However, the mood was sort of ruined by the lack of attention at the start. To complain any further during the dinner would just spoil the mood furtherCall me entitled, but I'm sure anyone paying 128++ per pax would have a higher expectation of service and attention.We left Zafferano with full (and satisfied) stomachs but the service left a lot to be desired.TL;DR: Great pre-arrival service and awesome food, pretty bad service
4
Spent a fantastic evening at Zafferano. Being on the 43rd floor rooftop the place has commanding views of the city. The bar/ lounge is alfresco and undoubtedly has the best views .The food lived up to expectations. What I specifically liked was that they offered regular and large portion sizes for some dishes, this makes total sense for people who are small eaters or like me, hate to waste food. Thursday is ladies night at Zafferano hence might be good for a girls night out. Restaurant has a strict dress code , no slippers , shorts etc, one needs to be mindful of this . All in all with good music, good views and fine food, this place definitely deserves repeat visits 
5
This is 2nd time we visit this restaurant, 1st time was heavy rain no chance to walk around outside the restaurant, this time nice weather, we can enjoy the view and nice foods, and the staffs are very friendly too, we really have a nice good dinner, will go again
5
I visited last Saturday night. The food was really nice and of course the service was excellent!They even have a special promotion to celebrate their 5th year! (The original price of one bottle of prosecco is SGD88 but I got in in SGD 55! and I loved it!)Also, you can go out to the bar and enjoy the fireworks which was awesome!I would like to visit again :)

We booked dinner here on a Saturday night in Singapore. We were seated with nice friendly greetings and the staff was awesome and always smiling. The restaurant was not full. We chose the Degustation tasting menu which was 4 course at SGD98.00. Hubby ordered the same and he as he is vegetarian, they were still able to cater to his needs. But the vegetarian menu is quite limited. The menu is very well worth the money. It was a lovely dinner with bread as starters. The restaurant ambience is nice with dark lights but I find it rather noisy with patrons quite loud, not exactly fine dining, more of a casual dining. Outdoors seem very popular with guests for drinks and good music. The location at Level 43 gives a good view of the city
3
Had a business lunch there. It would have been a forgettable experience had it not been for the bill. Set courses are around SGD 40-50 and rather tasteless and drab. I wish we had gone somewhere else that tries harder to win customers with food rather than the view. The view was limited too. Service was attentive though
5
We made a reservation for drinks at the terrace. It rained the whole day, and fortunately the rain stopped by the early evening. We were informed that in the event that it rains, they would not be able to serve us as it is an open air terrace. At the reception on the ground level, one of my guests was in bermudas, and thus was denied entry. The receptionist was kind enough to offer him a pair of pants to change into. We were then shown to the elevator that brings us to the 43rd level of the building. We had seats by the window which offered us an unobstructed view of Marina Bay. There is a happy hour from 5:30 to 7:00 pm. We had a pizza, chicken tenders, truffle fries and Parma ham. The food is nice and the pizza is quite big. I loved the "Eccellente" cocktail. Service is excellent and the DJ played some nice songs. We really enjoyed ourselves and we'll definitely visit again
4
The food is good and the staff are friendly.
We have enjoyed the beautiful scenery of sunset at the Lounge area before our dinner. Wonderful place for good food and view.
5
Still one of our favorite restaurants in Singapore. Beautifully prepared Italian food matched with great service from the super attentive and well trained staff. You simply can't go wrong with an evening here. Highly recommended!
5
Great ambience with excellent food, wine & service. The food was tasty and excellent playing. We weren't sure what wine to order as well and they gave us great recommendation.
4
Had the branzino and beer short ribs. Wonderful food and staff was very friendly. Great view in the outdoor lounge area.
5
A small group of us went to Zafferano for a post meeting lunch, and this place is nothing short of a simple elegance that I like. The ambiance is open and refreshingly lively yet professional, the staff were all very friendly and welcoming, not skipping a beat at any point during lunch. The food was very good. Well prepared, simple presentation, and full of flavor...nice job guys.You and your staff made our lunch meeting one that I wish could have gone on longer.For anyone looking for a nicer place for lunch or an upscale place for a drink without the stuffiness and pretense, I highly highly recommend Zafferano. Next time I am in Singapore I plan to go back
5
On the 5th of May, my hubby and myself were treated to an exquisite dining experience at Zafferano, perched at the top of OFC in Collyer Quay which not only offers a spectacular view but the food and the service standard were equally spectacular - we highly recommend every couple to dine at Zafferano for that memorable experience
5
An awesome nite as always @ zafferanos , excellent service , staff were professional & friendly.One of the best places to chill, lovely view!A great wine & fd menu to boot!A special mention going out to Ian & his Team, his strong leadership & people skills makes him a cut above the rest.The DJ Mr X , Malcolm Was indeed a crowd pleaser! Spinning tunes like a true master.Well done all! I look forward to my next visit, indeed a home away from home thank you!Thank you!
5
Great spot for an executive lunch; set menu is always well balanced and service deliver is prompt. Staff are on the ball and the foods really tasty. You can turn a full meal round in less than one hour, which is perfect for a client meeting
3
Had dinner on a Saturday evening with my mum and we are warmly welcomed by the service staff. The service staff have high level of service and pay attention to details. We ordered a Chef menu for the day and a lobster bisque and octopus as main. The Chef menu is rather standard, not much of a surprise. Antipasta under the Chef menu was angel hair with fresh oyster. The oysters are minced. Though tasty, but it's normal. We chosen the steak as the main, steak is set at medium. It's good and tasty but lack of "wow" factor.In summary, awesome view, Super star service but if you are a foodie, than you really need to manage your own expectations.
4
The service was excellent and the food was very reasonably priced and very good. My friend and I had the 2 course set lunch as we are not such big eaters. They were also very accommodating and fulfilled my request for a surprise sliced of birthday cake dessert for friend who was celebrating her birthday that day!
5
Great view of Singapore iconic building MARINA BAY SANDS and city skyline view. Beautiful green space outdoor to chilll and relax. Awesome food,drinks were even better specially made cocktails 👍🏽🍻Friendly & professional staff! Very good attention to detail. Well done guys!! Keep it up!! Cheers
3
Food was extremely disappointing. Only saving grace was the atmosphere of the restaurant. Won't be doing a repeat any time soon unless the food drastically improves.
5
This was a special day for us and the folks at Zafferano made it one to remember. Interesting vegetarian choices were customised for us. The deserts are absolutely brilliant.
5
We were lucky to have a table with a Marina Bay Sands view. We enjoyed our dinner; the lobster bisque is the most delicious soup I ever tried! After dinner, we had few martini drinks on the terrace. The bar manager really looks after you, and the whole team is incredibly attentive. I want to thank all Zafferano team for making our evening extra special! It was an amazing experience
2
The view is breath taking and the environment is luxury and modern with a very careful service but food quality is not at the same high level. It seemed to me an attractive place for local and wealthy Singaporean and tourists but ehy... food in Italy is other thing! I have to admit that the bill was lower than expected
5
The food was amazing and of course with a reasonable price as well. And if you are there, look out for Kumar! He makes the best cocktail and you will never get disappointed with what he came up with! I personally in love every single drinks he made. The Restaurant Manager, Paolo, was very friendly and attentive yet we still have our privacy. Definitely one of the restaurant that you should visit and revisit as many times as you can

A group of us ladies decided to go to the Thursday Ladies Night on the Terrace and it definitely didn't disappoint!We had free flowing prosecco at $38.50nett from 6pm to 9pm. Bar Manager Kumar and his staff was friendly and took good care of us!They served yummy pizza slices from 6.45pm and made sure we were hydrated with lots of water too!DJ Malcolm kept us up on our feet with his Brilliant music choices and he's an Experienced crowd reader and knows all the right tunes to play!The terrace has wonderful views of Singapore since it's on the 43rd level.The one thing that you would have to keep in mind is that when it rains,there isn't much of a shelter as it's an open air Terrace!I would definitely be back again with my friends and will bring my out of town guests to experience the Magic of Zefferano

Celebrated a friend's birthday at this swanky restaurant. The location is fantastic and the view to die for. But what stands out the most is the service; its a mixed of sophistication and yet authenticity that makes the experience a wonderful one. I like it when a restaurant combines great food, good view and yet a genuine service that warms the heart. A great night of great ambience and conversation.

We attended a wine pairing dinner featuring Yealands Estate last evening. It is possibly the best wine dinner we've attended so far. From the reception to service, staff were cheerful, warm and attentive. Speaker from the winery, Helen was so personalized coming around to share information on the vineyard and ask opinion on the wine we tasted. Dinner on the other hand was divine; beautifully paired with the selected wines. The appetizer, Hokkaido scallop ‘carpaccio’ was delightful with Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc 2015 with trout roe bursting its freshness. Lobster bisque, fettuccine, rougie duck breast were delicious. Dessert, crispy almond wafer with Valrhona chocolate mousse tops it off the meal brilliantly.We were so pleased to check out the terrace lounge before leaving. What a view it was!! Special thanks to Kumar, Bala, Carolina, Roland and manager Paolo. Will definitely recommend friends to come and visit

I have been to Zafferano a several times for special occasions and the food and service never fails to surpass my expectations.The view at Zafferano is lovely, so I do recommend having a drink in the lounge area before or after your meal.I was absolutely thankful to Jennifer (front of the house) and the rest of the service staff for accommodating my last minute surprise request. I had been busy with work travels and I decided I wanted to do something special for my significant other. Despite calling just the very afternoon to arrange for the surprise in the evening, Jennifer took my request promptly and executed it to the tee.Beyond good food and view, it is the warmth and the service that really sets Zafferano apart.Thank you very much

Very good view from their nice terrace lounge with chillaxing music. Good deal for happy hour cocktails and friendly service.

Maybe it was one of those nights because, make no mistake about it, this kitchen can cook but our meal did not consistently hit the heights. The scallop with caviar and a pea puree was stellar but the red prawns were overpowered by pineapple pieces that were a little too sweet as well as one or two other ingredients on the plate. The home made pasta is delicious but the sauce of ricci (sea urchins) and a touch of bottarga (roe) somewhat lacked the wow ! factor. The fresh fish (ombrina) was outstanding and nicely accompanied. If you have a sweet tooth Zafferano's is the best place in town to enjoy gelato and sorbets which are truly memorable. The sommelier really knows her stuff, is responsive to queries (ie. she listens), and is gentle and moderate in her upselling. The service overall is brilliant and the dining room delightful with plenty of room between the tables for an intimate chat. Outside there is a bar area (where, bizarrely given the cuisine served indoors) you can get a pizza as well as a smoke. Do at least visit it as the view is spectacular and very much lost inside the restaurant itself. We will definitely visit again but pay a little more attention to our choice of dishes next time.
5
We had a great time at Zafferano on the 8th of March. Excellent service, view from their terrace is amazing. As for the menu my husband tried tasting menu which was superb and i decided to opt for La Degustazione, where i could choose any 4 dishes from their a-la carte menu. I found the idea really great! I tried raw red prawns, agnolotti and scampi which were absolutely divine. Overall it was a really fantastic experience for both of us. Will definitely come back to try other things from the menu.Oh, nice touch was to receive from the house a stalk of rose and a glass of prosecco to celebrate an International Woman's day. Highly recommend
4
Had the 5 course tasting menu. I really liked the food. Service was relatively good. Didn't like the fact that they charge cakeage. $8/pax for bringing my own cake.
3
We chose the Sunset Dining. The view was great although it happened to be cloudy, rainy on that day. Did not manage to see any sunset. Hope we have better luck next time ;)Food was flavourful, within our expectation.During reservation, i asked for a seat more private as it was a birthday dinner. And they did. We appreciated that. The only thing that was out of my expectation was they didn't wish my partner a happy birthday. Perhaps the last few times when we had anniversary/birthday dinners in other fine dining restaurants, we received personal greetings (if they knew we were celebrating) which was a nice personal touch....
5
My wife and I had a drink and dinner at Zafferano. Wine selection even by the glass was nice. We ordered two primi dishes for starter--saffron rissoto and a seafood pasta dishes with octopus. I had lamb for main course and my wife had seafood pasta with battarga and crab. Service was impeccable--attentive but not intrusive. Great views of marina and financial district. Not an inexpensive evening but by Singapore fine dining standards it was value. Willing to pay for this caliber of food and service.
5
Zafferano may not have a star, but foodies in the know will appreciate all the little details that go into making the perfect dining experience. Last I was there for lunch, they were even ironing the table cloths after lunch so that they would be perfectly crisp for dinner. Props to the service and kitchen team both
5
As the balcony was occupied for a function on the Monday evening we attended we decided to try for the first time the set evening menu. Oh my! What a culinary experience from the starters served in a shell to the canneloni with tomatoe sauce with hint of mint, the fabulous main of lamb and equisite deserts, all paired with the most delicious, unusual and complimentary wines described in full by the lovely Caralina. Totally amazed to find such service and completly perfect food in Singapore. Having had lunch previously and not being much of a fish lover my tastebuds were exploded with flavoursome delights!. Thank you
5
My wife and I had lunch together at Z last Friday. She had the lobster bisque to start followed by the chicken breast and I had the white asparagus followed by the seafood pasta. Both meals were outstanding and the chicken was notably tender and juicy. In addition, its nice to have great views once in a while. Will definitely be going back
5
I love going to Zafferano on Thursday Evenings. Apart from the beautiful ambience and friendly staffs, they also have good promotions on their drinks. The food is good as well- my favourite is the pizza. The Dj plays good tunes.. good crowd and a lot of dancing on the roof top.Love my Thursdays
4
My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed dining at Zafferano. The restaurant had great views, ambience and good Italian food in addition to a wonderful service by very friendly and attentive staff.
5
Excellent upmarket restaurant. High standards of food. Interesting cocktails, especially if you leave it up to the bartender to mix one of his choice. The service is friendly and professional as expected from a restaurant of this caliber. Lovely ambiance.
5
We went for Pasta Mondays at Zafferano. The concept is: you choose from the pasta menu 3 different pasta´s which are served for the whole table.
The taste was amazing !!!
Afterwards we shared the trio of pannacotta, again hmmmmmmm
2
Valentines meal. Paid SGD 50 to sit at the window, but we were under the aircon, which was extremely cold. Staff said this was due to the building (not under their control) but that didn't make our experience any warmer. Ok, high volume of food required simultaneously to satisfy two sittings with a standard valentines menu - however the portions were small and the food made little taste impression - very forgettable. At around SGD 650 for 2, overpriced by a factor of 3....Staff were friendly (if a little stressed), service was good
4
Romantic and nice atmosphere. Service was good, server all the with a great smile. We went for the tasting menu which is available Monday to Saturday, and it was superb. Didn't expect it to be so good, never had such a great food in a longer time. Go and try it
5
Set on the 43rd floor there is a great view across the marina bay and the Singapore Straits. Right in the middle of the CBD yet a million miles away from the desk. The two set menus offer a good variety and all the dishes are tasty, balanced and not too heavy ...just what you need for a business lunch before a busy afternoo
3
In general I had a pleasant dinner here, good service, nice atmosphere, excellent view, gorgeous decor, but the food is average, not up to my expectation.总体来说不错的餐厅，环境优美，让人愉悦的氛围，友好的员工，服务周到，但是食物没有想象中的美味，至少和它的价位不相匹配
4
What a surprise, I did not know this one existed. what a great evening, drinks outside, a great meal, exceptional service. The best part is the Sommelier who knows her stuff, good wine prices and make sure to end of with a Grappa. Make a reservation and don't miss this one. Enjoy
4
Like I do in all my reviews of fine dining, I will state at the outset that I am a harsh critic and have high standards.We went here for the Christmas day set dinner, with my family. Overall, the food was acceptable and delicious, although slightly on the salty side for some reason. I liked the risotto (though too salty), the burrata salad (decent), the steak (cooked well) and the dessert bar. While I think it is was slightly overpriced, I guess that is because of the view and ambience. The sommelier made good recommendations, and I enjoyed the wine.This is a good place for a not-too-expensive anniversary dinner or romantic dinner. You will not be blown away but neither will you be too disappointed with a huge hole in your pocket
5
Tell me who establishes a fantastic restaurant with one of if not the best sommelier in Singapore and puts a bar/ nightclub in front of it obscuring the views of Singapore Harbour?Well Zafferano does! Still notwithstanding that one of the best restaurants in Singapore and one of the best and most interesting wine lists.I keep coming back. The mixture, the blend, the contrast is Singapore.
5
Good food with attentive service. Went in a group of 10 with colleagues n all enjoyed and clean up every plate. Coffee n desserts n food superb! Ambience also good for business lunch n evening dinners for couples!
4
This is a fine dining venue, but it was very busy which did take away from some of the ambiance of the restaurant.
5
We had lunch lunch buffet , ordered steak. Ok not bad. Loved their dried tomatoes. Ambience was good and view was even better! You can walk out pass the door to take picture outside. Coffee is not included in the buffet.Average $120+ for 2 person.

If my wife were to write this review, she would probably give this place 5 stars, but I stand by my review based on the dishes I ordered. The fact that we can sit side by side and have two completely different food experiences shows that the consistency of their kitchen is lacking.For start, lets just say the service is excellent, although the bar is a bit slow. It was a quiet night and it still took about 15 mins to get a drink. But the service on the whole is polite, considered and attentive. A rarity in Singapore. So I had the Hokkaido scallops, which were barely cooked and felt like they'd been sous-vide for about 3 days before been hit with a blow torch before being served. They were cold and jelly-like on the inside and made for not very good tasting. My wife had the caprese salad (not called that because its a pretentious Italian restaurant) which was delicious, amazing mozzarella that melted beautifully. Mains was the same story. I had the Iberico pork belly, which again felt like it was undercooked and was 90% fat to 10% meat. It was basically chewing through a large slab of fat. I feel the fat should be caramelised to give it some flavour and texture. The sides were excatly the same as for the scallops, which doesn't make sense (and are not described that way on the menu) and did the nuts did not go at all with the rest of the meal. My wife's octopus on the other hand was tender, smoked, charred and delicious. Ironically, the opposite occurred for dessert. My dessert was rich, well flavoured and had plenty of texture. I think in summary that was what was missing. Texture. It was fine dining but for a retirement home. Everything was soft and mushy. No texture, no flavour and no balance. Drinks: Wine was expensive and over prices for what it was.They make an excellent martini but otherwise their cocktail selection was poor. Add to this it was a $500 meal for two people, means I just can't justify visiting this place again. Although I'm sure my wife will be back
1
Started with unmatched foie gras & sauce, continued with some over-cooked beef tenderloin (without proper dressings/gravy etc) and average street-quality pasta and desserts. Rude servic
4
Waiters were friendly and food was nice. Even though the restaurant was on a high floor, we could not seat at the best table to enjoy the view. But it was okay since the environment was pretty good to have a gathering for end of year.
5
Kumar and the team is rocking the service here. I'll be back anytime for the drinks! The ambiance is good as it gives a good view at the CBD area. Good place for leisure/business too. Kumar and the team makes you feel at home, where they make sure your food and drinks are I n order. If you're gonna be paying for the same price for beer around the area, why not have a better service and experience
5
There are many fine Italian restaurants in Singapore, ZAFFERANO restaurant has to be one of them. The view is amazing and the ambiance is stylish, with designed spaces in a generous mode, the beautiful bar and the dining area, And not to mention the kitchen behind the glass wallsperfect in all aspect. The food here is amazing. Better than most Italian restaurants in Italy. The food prices aren't unreasonable, for Singapore of course. It is really authentic Italian. It is very well presented and nice portions too. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. The personally greeting touch by the owner to make sure that you’re dinning and food meets the expectations is a big plus. Well worth a visit if you are a visitor or a local, it’s extremely worth a visit for its incredible food and breath-taking view. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will be back very soooon
5
I went there to celebrate a Birthday. The food was incredible good and the staff amazing. Very kind and attentive. We decided to have the cake outside to enjoy the nice view from the terrace. we were in 3 only but when the staff got noticed that someone was celebrating without saying anything they brought us a cake. Moreover when we arrive the also offered us a glass of "prosecco"Strongly recommended
4
- Food was good! We had two fish dishes (Cod fish & Seabass fillet). Just a little on the salty side. - Presentation of food was really nice as well.- Crew is friendly and attentive.- Special request for window seats was taken into acc and there was complimentary cake as it was a birthday celebration :)- Only downside is that the lady at level 1 (who assists for the elevator) is not friendly at all. Zaff should definitely improve this. She was just looking at her phone 99% of the time and did not bother to smile at all while gesturing the direction to us
4
Love the outside bar. Ladies nights are amazing and the DJ plays great music. Staff is helpful - but difficult to attract their attention sometime!
5
Was at the lounge with a couple of friends and we had a really good time! The view's amazing, food & drinks were on point but what we loved most was the service - Kumar and his bartender were phenomenal. Would definitely head back again!
5
Ambience and service were first class. Food was fresh and tasty but a little overpriced. Would definitely go again for a special occasion.
4
Still miss the buffet from a few years ago but the new set lunches are high quality. Coupled with an excellent view it's a good spot for lunch. Sea bass was excellent.
5
We came to this restaurant for their New Year's Eve event last year and had an awesome night! Their food was top quality and very good. The view of the bay (and fireworks) was wonderful. Highly recommend this venue for events or for dinner! 👍🏼👍🏼
5
Had the set lunch, was great. However, desert was a bit disappointing, which last time was fantastic.
5
Firstly the good feel starts with the hostess at the ground floor level, who escorted us to the lift to whisk us straight to the top 43d floor.The view is fabulous and the ambiance is chic yet not loud, with well designed spaces, the kitchen behind the glass walls, the beautiful bar and the dining area.The place is perfect also for a nice drink before or after the meal. We had a fantastic white Italian wine for starters, and it was not expensive, for Singapore of course. The sommelier lady knew her stuff and gave the right suggestions. Also the general manager was very courteous and gave good suggestions on the menu. Both are nice and approachable. Ask them for recommendations as per your preferences. We had angel hair pasta with oysters and black caviar- an absolute must try. They got it also on the degustation menu.Then we had a short rib which was very smooth and exploding with taste in the mouth. We also had a tasty octopus. Then I had probably my best macarons ever. Usually I don’t order these, but it was recommended and indeed- the most moist and flavourful, freshly made, these were awesome. I had lemon flavoured. They got quite a variety of macarons there, all freshly made. Chocolate lava also great as well.We were already full and happy with our meal. And the weather was nice. We could not resist and ordered martinis to sit outside on the huge veranda, up in the sky above the Marina Bay and the beautiful Singapore Central Business District. A view to die for.But then the martinis took away our attention- another major surprise. The barman, who apparently was behind lots of exotic inventions in the Grand Hyatt famous martini bar is now creating his amazing concoctions in Zafferano! He asked us what kind of type and taste we feel like now. He accordingly created remarkable cocktails for us. Ask for his refreshing cucumber (yes, not a mistake! and amazing) and a tingly- fresh passion fruit martinis.Then for the grand finale we had a nice whiskey with a cigar from their humidor. What a great and memorable dinner.I have been to this restaurant a couple of years ago. It got so much better. It is now in a totally different league. Well worth a visit if you are a visitor or a local. Can’t have enough of such fantastic food to go so well with a spectacular view
5
Had dinner with friends - the food was perfectly cooked with delicate flavorous. Atmosphere was nice and the view add to the gastronomic experience. loved the martini coffee!Would definitely come again!
5
Few places in Singapore can claim this statement - lunch in the sky - Zafferano certainly can. Towering 240 m you get a staggering 270 degrees view of the Marina Bay Area. They have an executive set lunch and special martinis night on Saturdays and Monday's. Imagine my surprise when upon entering I see a sea of businessmen. Where are the ladies?!!! Ladies night is on Thursdays! Reservation is highly recommended.
4
Zafferano had a super great view. The menu was bit limited for me but the food was quite good. We tried the cod fish and the ravioli. For desert we tried the dark chocolate mouse which was not up to standard but the Melting chocolate lava cake was super delicious. Red wine was also good. They have a good selection.
4
Love the ambience & the interior design of the dining area. The Al fresco area is great for chill out & drinks. Drinks were good, the price on the high side tho after the happy hours. Great music and excellent view and staffs were pretty attentive. The negative side is when asked if they serve any nuts or chips, were informed they run out due to busy Friday the night before. How can a club run out of nuts on a Saturday?
5
Had my birthday dinner at this fabulous restaurant. They had such a huge selection of wine that they've to be listed in a wine list booklet. The waiters were always attentive to serve. Food was authentic Italian and the kitchen was quick to serve too. We moved to the outdoor for dessert which the restaurant facilitated without fuss.
5
Situated on level 43, Zafferano offers great views of the city, but the real sparkle is inside.The food dishes are quite outstanding, especially the signature dishes designated "Z" for Zafferano.The sommelier had a great knowledge of wine and Italian wine in particular and was generous in sharing her knowledge.The range of wine by the glass was excellent - we enjoyed a 2010 Barolo.For fine dining, excellent service, and a great experience, the prices are very reasonable. Go if you can
5
What a fabulous place!After whizzing up to the 43rd floor you are blown away by a breathtaking view of Singapore. That in itself is great!We went along for some drinks and bar food so sat outside and looked out towards the Marina Sands Hotel.Our waiter was super friendly, had a great sense of humour and when we told him that we could not decide on a cocktail, delivered us the most beautiful tasting cocktails. Really gentle flavours, really good :)We had some light bar bites which consisted of a platter of Italian Meats - perfect for what we needed.A lovely treat - I'll return again for sure
4
Zafferano is a nice restaurant based on 43th floor of Ocean Financial Centre (OFC). OFC is the heart of Raffles Place, Central Business District of Singapore with stunning views on Marina Bay Sands. The restaurant have a restaurant area for dining and terrace for drinks and snacks facing world known hotel Marina Bay Sands.What I liked about - location is good for business and romantic meetings, views are stunning, service is very good. What I have questions about is menu - simple example - I like my steak with fries or potatoes, but you don't have any potato option of sides at all, only spinach, mushrooms or asparagus. Well, may be I'm not a very sophisticated person, but I like fries.. Or you can't order the pizza in the main dining area, only outside. All this small stupid restrictions are stoping me from putting 5*. Terrace is really nice! Highly recommend for chilling out in the evening watching Infinity Pool and Laser Show of Marina Bay Sands
5
Great view, top of a building with a large outside balcony. We were there after a conference from midnight to 2am. There was plenty of room despite our 200 person crowd and it was really unique. I cannot rate it for food as we didn't try any.
5
Bought a bottle of Krug 2003 to have dinner with a friend. The female sommelier was excellent , sharing her insight and experience. We ordered a bottle of Barolo to decant it and enjoy a long drawn dinner from 7pm to almost 12 midnight. Krug was savoured slowly until about 10 plus then we proceed to the canubi 2007 Barolo . Food was excellent
4
We had a night out at this place and it was lovely. Drinks were very good and service as well. Only complaint is about the selection of appetizers available. There were very limited options so would be nice if they integrate few more things people can choose from. Music was great DJ entertaining. Overall a good one to try!! Recommended!
5
We visited the restaurant with an Italian friend of us, in Singapore for few days. On Friday we decided to reserve a table to try the brunch event, also because we read that brunch is happening just once per month and it was right the day after. We have been impressed by: A) the quality of the food: Italian food appreciated by Italian people ... sometime reinterpreted but alway faithful to the original receipt, with high quality of the ingredients, like the burrata. B) friendliness of the staff: we were there also with our two kids, 5 and 7 years old, and the staff was extremely loving also with them! Kids below 8 are anyway not allowed at dinner time, and I can personally fully understand this choice. C) the sight: Marina Bay Sand towers seem so close and the boat is just at your level...it's like being in the sea, with Singapore sight all around. We would definitively try again this restaurant with other guests
3
The food here is really nothing special - the lamb was decent without being anything the write home about. Service here is good and there are plenty of people working - it's a place one would come to and have a drink and enjoy the view from the top of the building. All in all just ok.
5
The staff at Zafferano was amazing. They made us feel so comfortable and the dinning experience was one to be remembered. The food was spot on. A place to have the perfect dinner date.
5
Lovely evening enjoined the good and the wine. We had wonderful service and the sommelier was outstanding and the manager really looked after our table.
5
My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful evening highlighted by exceptional service from the staff. All involved allowed the celebration of my wife's birthday to be above and beyond expectations.
5
Dinner and drink at Zafferano was a great way to end the week.
Beautiful set up with outdoor bar with a great view.
Authentic Italian food well presented and really good wine selection.
Nice Martini too
4
We had a completely vegetarian meal from the buratta to start. Pastas and risotto for mains. Great value for money but service could have been expedited.
4
Food is good however it was hard to get attention of the servers considering not all tables were taken during lunch
5
I have hosted three business lunches here over the past year, with the set choices starting around $60 a head for three courses inclusive of taxes etc this is great value for the style of food, venue and service. Wines at $16 a glass also very good for a Singapore restaurant. Not surprisingly, you need to book. The Wagyu carpaccio and the sea bass and a chicken cacciatore went down a treat at our table as did a vermentino off the list kindly suggested by the sommelier when she heard us talking about a dry white. She later thanked me for allowing her to recommend a wine. Style. And that one word is all you need to know about this place!
5
Visited Zaffarano Restaurant located on 43rd Floor of Ocean Financial Tower. Nearest MRT station will be Raffles Place. Hostess at the ground floor will usher patrons to lift "H" which will go directly to Level 43.Celebrated my friend's birthday a day on advance. Good colourful night view over Marina Bay, Marina Financial District and Padang. Had lobster bisque, octopus & lemon sherbet. My friend had the lobster bisque, angus beef, slice of cookie & cream birthday cake & lemon sherbet. The specially made strawberry & bananamacarons were on the house. Friendly helpful knowledgeable waiters. Really tasty dinner.Nice ambience and two persons dine at $189. It's my second visit dining here. Enjoyed. Will come back again.

Once you get over the phenomenal view from the balcony and you get to eat, your taste buds will immediately ranks Zafferano among the top Italian restaurants in Singapore. Even when I attempted to find something to criticize, Paolo the friendly and very, very experienced Maitr D' and his team of Italian speaking charmers make you feel right at home. I was introduced to this gem of a restaurant by a business associate who treated me to real mouth watering Parma - this was perfectly cured ham (not the various non-Italian imitations that just pile salt on cured meat), the home-made pasta had the most PERFECT texture with great flavours opening up my palate. I am not a great meat eater, but the Tagliata di Manzo was perfetta! Not convinced about this "too good to be true" restaurant, we returned there several times to taste different dishes - we absolutely had to find something to criticise... we are still looking... - One evening we challenged Paolo to guide us through a wine journey through the dishes we were enjoying: we started at 7, we ended at midnight having tasted, compared and discussed with Paolo and his wine expert different wines, vintages and food combination. My recommendation: Get to know Paolo and his staff and book a "journey" with them... hopefully together we can find something to critique! It's too good to be true
5
A great place for italian cuisine. Has a great view of the Marina Bay and it's a great place to hang around for drinks with friends.The food is ok, not really impressive, but it's compensated by their very good wine selection.Very attentive, prompt, staff and a fabulous ambience.Recommended
4
Foood prices seem reasonable. Menu scanty on meat and fish dishes? Menu can be more varied. Prices of beverages and wines and pricier than in other similar restaurants. The 2 bottles of champagne I had was each about $30 more. Great ambience and excellent service.
4
Really great food and service! Nice vibes and comfortable settings. Tried the crab linguine and the steak, both of which were nicely done. Good value for money!
5
Don't speak. Please kiss the pasta chef. House-made veal ravioli with porcini mushroom sauce and truffle emulsion outbeats any other noodles and pasta in town.
5
1. Very impressive roof-top view of Singapore.2. Authentic Italian food that is delicious.3. Great selections of wine.4. Classy ambience.5. Staff that will go out of their way to make your day special.On the whole, a restaurant highly recommended for travellers who want to have a special treat in SG!:

Situated on the 43rd floor of the Ocean Financial Centre this fairly laid back Italian restaurant offers good views over the city and has an open air rooftop terrace around three sides of the main restaurant. Unfortunately, the latter was booked for a function when we visited but would have been our choice if we could have eaten there. Pre-dinner cocktails (both signatures and classic) were well crafted and moreish. Food was interesting and everyone was impressed with their chosen dish. Menus change fairly frequently. As an example, I had the manzo – rucola – Parmigiano Reggiano (wagyu beef ‘carpaccio’, Italian wild rocket, parmesan cheese) and polpo sardo – salmoriglio (poached and pan-seared Sardinian octopus ‘salmoriglio’ style with seasonal vegetables). Both were first rate (and should have been at S$26 and S$42) so basically upmarket fine dining type of venue but relaxed and friendly ambience and staff. Certainly worth a visit. We tried a Vernaccia for the wine - also a hit
2
Third time in a row this restaurant has pushed us out early. This time not because of an evening function, but rather a fire drill (which they did not inform us of before the booking). 43 floors of steps later we got out of the venue...
5
Went to Zafferano with a special and esteemed guest whom I needed to impress. From before we even entered the restaurant we were impressed, they had their own lane at the lobby of the building with a Zafferano staff who guided us towards the penthouse level of the building where Zafferano is situated. When we reached the top the restaurant had a beautiful and sexy looking stand with more hostesses and we were again guided to our table. The restaurant overlooks the financial bay area and has stunning views of Marina Bay Sands and the existing office buildings. Very impressive! We sat at a table near the alfresco area which they have beautifully adorned with greenery and proceeded to have lunch.We ordered burrata for a starter and spanner crab pasta and octopus. The taste, presentation and preparation was to the level of quality you would find in a Michelin starred restaurant. Really superb food. The burrata was heaven and you will have the same feeling that Salvador Dali experienced when he said that he felt that he was going to die, from an overdose of satisfaction. The octopus was beautiful, you didn't know whether to eat it or whether to hang it on the wall of the Louvre in Paris. You didn't even need a knife as it was cooked so tender. The spanner crab pasta you could eat with your eyes and nose as the smell was intoxicatingly fantastic.The staff was attractive to the eye and attentive, 2 things that you want when having a beautiful dinner, at some restaurants the staff actually puts you off the food, but here they blended seamlessly with the nice restaurant decor and environment.We will be back especially when there are important guests to impress.Thank you Zafferano, great job and compliments to the Chef and team
5
2nd time to this restaurant for dinner and it only gets better. I was personally attended to by Mr Paolo, the restaurant manager and his services was impeccable. Food was just great and the fois gras was one of the best around. Lamb shank was sweet and dessert was to die for. View was just amazing but the reason for going back was the food and the people. The key word here is consistency. No regrets spending my money here

This review was based on my first and last experience in this restaurant with my husband. Couldn't even bother wanting to write anything about it till I was prompt by Trip Advisor on an email to give a review. So why not and here's my long story short....Service staffs:Excellent, friendly and helpful especially to the Restaurant Manger.Food: (Here's the tricky part and depends on what you order.)Everything prior to our main course was great until the main. Do not order Fiorentine if you are expecting the original version as in what you will get in Florence Italy or the least the way its being cooked. You will be disappointed! How? Meat was overcooked (at medium-well)- why???? maybe meat is not fresh? And already sliced - why???? And topped with some weird sauce on the entire plate of meat - not acceptable!!! Especially to my Italian husband - eating at an Italian restaurant.Well, if we ordered a plate of T-bone sliced steak served with a special house sauce, perhaps we wouldn't be that disappointed. Chef: (Now here's the drama....)Spoke with the manger on our discontent for him to relate our feedback to the chef. So came this young mid 30ish looking Italian guy "the chef". Now he wasn't at all loud or looking upset BUT the things he said to us on our feedback was unprofessional, inexperienced, arrogant.....I could go on and on.... so here's what you will get from an upset chef whom took negative feedback negatively when you give honest feedback, he said:1) we should be ashamed of ourselves for complaining2) that our feedback is only our own opinion3) that his restaurant is full and nobody is complaining4) that we should eat elsewhere if we think that elsewhere is betterVerdict? Service = staff = excellent, chef = ......... no words.........Food = Fiorentine = BadValue = no commentAtmosphere = no commen

Having lived in Singapore for 5 years I had never heard of Zafferano until recently. What a hidden treasure ! The view is unbeatable - a different perspective on Marina Bay from the outdoor terrace (will come back for a romantic dinner to enjoy night views). Their business lunch set is priced very reasonably for a fine dining place. I ordered a la carte - pan seared octopus for main course. Octopus is not an easy dish to cook, but Zafferano did surprise me - my "polpo sardo" was very tender and tasted really good.The service is impeccable - one can tell they put a lot of effort getting the right team together. Zafferano has practically only one solid wall, the rest is glass, so it's full of light - very uplifting atmosphere, excellent for both serious business lunch and festive gathering of friends and colleagues. The only annoyance - to get to elevator lobby at the ground floor of the office tower, one has to ask a front desk lady to open the gate for you

Went last Thursday night at Zafferano a group of ladies from the Singapore Paddle Club and we have a fantastic time.
The staff were very friendly, I would like to mention Kumar and the good music which the DJ plays.
Thank you very much

I enjoyed my first visit here and the food was good. We did not have the standard gourmet menu or lunch menu but the ala carte was also impressive.
5
Staff were most helpful and attentive to make this an awesome experience for the family. Well done & thanks!

On 15 Mar 2016, visited Zafferano located on Level 43 of Ocean Financial Building for dinner with some friends. Easily accessible from Raffles Place MRT station.Was at the restaurant before sunset. Saw the city view by day and night. There's indoor and outdoor area. Indoor air con area serving food and the outdoor area serving drinks. Outdoor area provided good city view of Singapore Financial District, Marina Bay & some historic sites.Food and dessert are good. Enjoyed the ambience very much. Average about $80 per diner for a main course with dessert and drinks
4
Nothing fantastic about Zafferano but definitely pretty good. It was quiet when I visited so didn't have the option of outdoor seating as the outdoor area was closed (This wasn't mentioned to me when I booked & requested outdoor seating) The service was good & it was reasonably priced for what it wa

Celebrated my birthday with drinks at Zafferano's with a group of 20+ friends. Service was impeccable despite it being a busy ladies night (Thursday), particularly by Kumar the bar manager. He personally kept a close eye on our group- topping drinks up continuously, bringing round munchies, checking up on everyone. The ladies night deal is brilliant (free flow prosecco from 6-9pm for sgd 30), and the dozens of cocktails we ordered after that were just as (if not even more!) brilliant. Kudos to the bar staff, especially Kumar.
4
Nicely nestled at the top of the building facing the Marina Bay Sands. We got there early so got to enjoy cocktails on the patio. Good decor. Only complaint I would have is when went in for a meal we carried over our own drinks as the waitress or senior hostess couldn't be bothered to help..this felt odd....also as they got busier service got slower....food was good. Portions could be bigger. .good wine menu. And speed between meals was good..also the atmosphere was great.
3
Started off with a drink on the terrace which is awesome with great views over the city. Moved inside to our table for two which was poorly configured at a window with both of us staring into the backs of people on the terrace. With enough encouragement we were moved. The food is of high quality (and matching prices) but the music ramped up as the evening progressed. This had the effect of turning a high end romantic dinner into a night club feel. We left and had Haggen Daas on the street for dessert
5
I think, I am not able (as Google does) to name either top 10 Italian restaurants in Singapore or 5. I can name just one and it is really the top. It is called Zafferano. Top restaurant from the floor to kitchen. View is really fantastic from the top- floor terrace. Food and wine are just magic. And, as you may know, life is a combination of magic and pasta. Federico Fellini said it

We were there on a Friday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. That was my 3rd time there. I was extremely impressed with the service the 1st time and to my pleasant surprise, their service gets better each time! The lady serving us noticed that my friends and I are pregnant, so she brought us cushions for us to rest on our back! She made sure that our scallops were well cooked and lava cake came without alcohol. She also arranged a birthday surprise for my friend. We enjoyed our dinner thoroughly.If there's one thing we wish for, we will be happy if there were more appetizer options for pregnant women.
5
Everything is excellent. Good for dating and family's dinner. A good city view. The service is pretty nice.
5
Veem good service and good food! Undortunately the weather was not good and we could not enjoy the view... But I am sure in beautiful days would be fantastic.
5
nice view of the surrounding and have both indoor and outdoor. Service was excellence.
had this for valentine date. cosy and ambiance is there
4
This is one of the great place to visit in Singapore if you are looking for perfect Italian food and a perfect atmosphere.
4
Came for dinner with a group of four. Overall fast seating and friendly service. The menu was ok, lacking some traditional Italian dishes but still good. The service was fast and prompt, the food wasn't anything over the top. overall decent meal and a great view
4
Went here for a leaving dinner. The service was nothing short of impeccable. They had messed up our order by not delivering it to us, but it was still reflected on the bill. Not only did they cancel it from the bill, they still delivered it to us FOC. Numerous "on the house" items which was a pleasant surprise. Amazing view, our waited told us that despite MBS having 57 floors (this is on the 43rd), we were still higher up from the sea level. This makes this restaurant an underrated one. Portions were a bit too small for the price in my eyes, but exploding with contemporary flavour and taste. Food was also served at a very dismal temperature. If you are expecting high temperature in your food do not come. From that aspect, their rating does fall. Service does make you want to come back again and again
5
We had the good fortune to choose Zafferano for our first Christmas dinner outside of our homeland of New Zealand. It was a wonderful dining experience and fantastic location. we loved it so much that on our way home in mid January we visited again for drinks and starters
1
We attempted to attend Ladies night last week, and despite speaking to the restaurant on the day and have a reservation for dinner that night, they cancelled the event because it was raining!!!!! The team did not phone us to let us know and when we arrived the staff were rude, patronising and arrogant. This is the second time that a group of us has attempted to attend this event, the first time we phoned in advance and were informed that we could not reserve but welcome to come. When we arrived it was shut for a private event, again this was not mentioned on the phone.. If you are expecting the same standards as the sister restaurants - don'tWe will not be attempting a third visit
5
I mean very high quality Italian food in Asia, probably the best, amazing ambiance and polished service. The restaurant does not simply serve good Italian food but also gets celebrity Michelin chefs from time to time. The terrace is one of the best in the city and is a hidden gem for Lady's night drink. I will definitely be back and highly recommend this as a sophisticated establishment
5
I have been going several times to Zafferano, the last time being this week. The food is just excellent with a very talented Italian chef - if you are looking for good Italian cuisine combined with a bit of grastronomic touch, this is the place to go in Singapore; the service is perfect and very nice; and the view is simply one if the best you could have on Marina Bay and MBS. I definitely recommend to anyone and will be back soon
4
The restaurant changes their menu periodically. The servings are delicate and curated. Waitstaff is trained and pleases. A table near the window just caps a pretty meal. Drinks can be had al fresco from early evenings. Recommended.
5
Visited the restaurant for a birthday celebration. Enjoy the food and the great ambience. Service is great too.
3
There were not many people and the atmosphere is not what we expected.
There is not a italian or Asian charm.
The food was excellent. The Italian chef is really good.
PRICE is to high ....
I'm not sure that I will return there again.
5
We had lunch at Zafferano in Christmas Day together with our dear friends from Brisbane, The food, service and atmosphere was wonderful, Thanks to everyone at the restaurant.
2
Food was too expensive. I've had better Italian in Singapore at more reasonable prices. And waiter was snobby, rolled his eyes when we wanted to order 3 appetizers to share among 5. Granted the portions were tiny, and totally not worth the price!
4
Service was a little slow, particularly for how empty the restaurant was during our visit on Monday evening. However, I think they were just giving us time to enjoy and we weren't in a hurry. The food was quite good - starters and mains. The wine was better than expected for the price (not cheap, but reasonable for an Italian Barolo). Others have complained about the cost, I found it to be less that I expected given the overall quality
1
It's not a big menu and it is expensive. Food is average by far and I wasn't particularly amazed by the service
4
Great service and good food. Promptly seated once i arrived with the dinner party. Waitstaff extremely patient with my barrage of questions about the questions about each of the dishes.Appetizer of scallop carpaccio fresh and succulent with theacidity of the citrus providing a refreshing contrast. Main was also pretty good. Chicken flambed at table was a show we all enjoyed and a good topic to talk about. Foie gras stuffing was balanced but could have done with a bit more acidity in the dish so it doesn't get flat towards the end. Portion was huge.Overall enjoyable and would be back to try more dishes
3
Went with my wife. There are better places for the food, view, service, and price. My wife requested for a simple garden salad, they mentioned using Lollo Rosso which we were fine with. It came without any Lollo rosso... and cost close to $20! The wine was probably the best thing there. It was a date night so I didn't want to kick up a fuss but I won't be going back and wouldn't recommend it.
5
We went there for Christmas dinner and had a great time It was a set menu with sufficient choice for the 3 of us The team were very welcoming and attentive The degustation menu was fabulous with sufficient volume for our son The desert table was great and regularly refreshed Wine selection was amazing but pricy but that's the SG tax View was stunning and you are able to go outside as well Checkout the amazing toilets
5
Enjoy all my visits - the wine selections, the food tastes very good...visual treats too. Great View and good service.
5
A romantic dining experience with a mesmerizing view of Marina Bay. The food and wine were perfect and the service was excellent! We will definitely be back soon !

Good views,good venue, good food & good service.
The pastas & risotto were good.
Nicely located & good ambience.

My dining companions and I ordered the tasting menu (individually) as well as the linguine crab pasta to share. The sea bass from the tasting menu was good but we found the pasta too tough for our liking. We called for the floor manager and explained that we would like the pasta to be cooked a little longer, and the floor manager explained that it was supposed to be al dente style and hence the pasta is tougher. We added that we understood this but the pasta is still way too tough. We have dined at other Italian restaurants before (even in Italy itself) and we have never tasted such tough pasta. Grudgingly, the manager took back our plates. One of my dining companions then went to the bathroom and walked past their kitchen (which had see-through glass walls) and saw that they actually re-cooked the pasta that we apportioned and ate. We again called for the manager and he said because there was nothing wrong with the pasta, they didn't have to cook a new plate. We explained that this is not the right - 1) if the chef had felt strongly that the pasta was properly cooked, he should have come out and explained to us in person, 2) it is never right for such a restaurant to pour back the apportioned pasta and re-cook it. A new plate should be cooked. When the second plate of pasta arrived, the chef came out to explain and check on us. Unfortunately, the damage to the restaurant's reputation is done. We came expecting to be wowed by the food and service, but instead were disappointed by their lack of attention to such basic kitchen rules. How could food that has been apportioned and eaten be put back into the pot again? My dining companions and I will never return to this restaurant. There are plenty of other equally good, if not better, Italian restaurants in Singapore, and I must say that Zafferano is not on this list

I went there and I was amazed since I walked in (even if that day was ladies night and was crowded). The place is amazing with a stunning view of Singapore from both the restaurant and the bar outside. The food was great: I'm italian and I lived in sg for 3 months. That was the first time I felt as being in Italy again. The price it's really high (I'm still a student) but I'm glad to have spent that money there. The staff is nice (even if like everywhere in Singapore, they take back your plate in the exact moment you are eating the last pieces of food). Paolo, the restaurant manager is nice and very welcoming! I really enjoyed this culinary experience.
5
Visited this place which was blocked out for us for a party. Hosted about 180 people. The service standards are excellent, the food was brilliant.The outdoors provides simply stunning views of beautiful Singapore and the indoors has room for a dance floor as well. One of the best restaurants in Singapore in my book and a pleasure to visit it overtime. However....like with most top end restaurants in Singapore, its best not to look at the bill too closely ....its painful indeed :-
4
First went there when they just opened. Great buzz, view and food. Nowadays, there are abundance of Italian eateries. Are they still good? Would they still stack up well against the new entries? Yes and yes we're the answers when we went to check it out. The views out to the Marina Bay are great even in the haze that besieged the city. The best piatti were the pastas and red meat entrees. Will be back when the haze clea

We were warmly welcomed by a hostess at the lobby and transported to the top of Ocean Financial Building. Perched on the 43rd level, the location is a plus for its high-rise view of Singapore's skyline and classy ambience with swanky interiors, an open kitchen and wine cellar. We had the Italian Table Brunch. First, antipasti:Live seasonal oysters (limited to 2 per pax) were fresh. Marinated fjord trout with ‘avruga’ caviar was normal as were the cold cuts. The classic burrata was probably the nicest. Deep fried calamari, prawns and anchovies were well executed while the baby lobster ‘flambé’ with Brandy, cocktail mayo sauce was at best average. The stewed clams and mussels with rosemary croutons was flavourful but a pity it was cold by the time we got to it (the antipasti all came out at the same time). For the pasta courses, they were all very hearty (and heavy). Lasagne andgnocchi and veal ravioli with ‘porcini’ mushroom sauce, truffle emulsion were competent. Now, the main reason why I decided to check Zafferano out was for its superfine ‘risotto Acquerello’ with Iranian saffron, served Milanese style. All my foodie friends had raved and waxed lyrical about it. Unfortunately, the risotto we had that day was undercooked and when I gently gave my feedback to the Maître D', his reaction was most disappointing - He condescendingly told me that "that's how it's eaten in Italy". WelI, I have eaten far superior and authentic versions (across Italy and in Milan as well) so I would like to think that I know when my risotto is undercooked and it certainly was the case. For main course, I had the slow-cooked pork belly. The flavours of the potatoes were on point though a tad dried out, the pork was tender as expected though I wished it had skin on and finished to a crisp with a sear for some contrast in textures. Berry sauce did its job to cut across the fat.Desserts were limited and nothing to shout about, though the tiramisu just managed to pass muster as did the vanilla panna cotta. The simple Affogato presented a la minute was good enough for seconds.Portions were right and the prosecco kept flowing, but the service still leaves much more to be desired. At first, they said coffee & tea were not included, but later we were told it was. We were also disappointed with the dire lack of choices for the ice cream and sorbet flavours (only Vanilla, Lime & Strawberry)All in all, Basilico edges out in terms of price-point value, variety & service

I was on a business lunch at Zafferano while in Singapore for a conference. What I immediately realized coming from Hong Kong was the open space in this venue. This is ideal for a business lunch as there is enough space between each table to have a private conversation. Great views of Singapore as well (although if you are going for the view make sure to reserve a table by the window).The food was excellent. I had the business lunch set and chose a Burratina as a starter which was really good (and as it is so rare I was just amazed that I got the chance to have it while in Singapore). For mains I had a nice seafood pasta which apart from being slightly small was absolutely great. I will definitely visit again when back in Singapore
4
I work in OFC so this is an easy choice for lunch with visitors and clients. The ambience is good with a great view, however the food and the service let down what could be a great lunch venue. It seems as though there aren't enough staff to cover the lunch shift and they seem a little forgetful and flustered (perhaps they are busy covering too many tables).The lunch menu has a couple of pre-set options and the food sounds great, however the quality when it arrives is disappointing - especially for the price charged. There are plenty of other options in Raffles place that are a better experience and quality of food.
5
Unplanned visit. Satisifited Meal. To be honest speaking, I dont really like Itlian food. No offense, it's just can't fullfil my stomach and toungue. But Zafferano tottally turn that up side down for me at least. But the wine is at a quite high price.
4
We had a free flowing champagne brunch. It is a nice restaurant with great views of the marina and the buffet was outstanding. However, for SGD140 each, it should have been! I think this is expensive even for free-flowing champagne.
3
Good food and wine at high prices considering the local alternatives.
Everything good - but nothing great. A fairly flat experience all round.
5
Stunning view of Marina Bay, attentive staff, great food and a great offer for Ladies' Night. We will definitely be back :-)
5
Great view. Delicious food. Courteous service. Classy ambience for business lunch. A great venue. Must visit.

Excellent lamb menu and black cod were delicious. The drinks, food and dessert were exquisite and we were let down only by lack of attention of the serving staff. 2 of my colleagues' coffee and dessert were missed out. all finished and serving staff did not even notice the lapse. We reminded them and it took awhile because the order must have not be logged or else, what could be the cause of the long wait? It was a farewell lunch for a fellow colleague friend and he loved the food and ambience. However I was not very impressed as waiter who served him spilt his coffee onto the saucer. Instead of taking it back coming with a clean saucer n cup, he just left it as it is with a word " sorry". So my friend had to drink his cup of coffee taking care of the dripping from under his cup...not very professional in terms of basic serving manners in such a restaurant
4
Right in the business district along Collyer Quay, is this elegant yet cosy Italian restaurant. The veal ravioli with mushroom sauce and truffle essence was very good but the most memorable was the lamb rack - tender and flavoursome with natural juices. Service was inconsistent and somewhat slow.
3
Visited Zafferano previously and was impressed with their food and ambience. Visited this time for restaurant week lunch. Ambience was still great but the beautiful view was compromised by the haze and we couldn't enjoy much view even though we were seated by the window. On food, I must compliment the lobster bisque which was awesome. The snapper was slightly overcooked and hence a little dry.Service staff who served our table were very friendly and food were served promptly. Reception staff were very welcoming as well. There were a couple of service staff who were standing near the kitchen area who looked a little awkward and were not as friendly
4
Our reception on arrival was very welcoming. We both loved the ambience. The maitre'd was very engaging and made us feel at ease. The staff are very professional and take pride in what they do. Excellent wine collection, service and delicious food made our dinner for two very special. We intend returning with the rest of our family. Despite its extraordinary views of Marina Bay, it still delivered value for money and that's saying something considering the prices we've had to pay in Singapore for restaurants that do not even have this high standard
4
the service didn't quite make it. Attended the Gusto Italiano event. The Chef and Manager were good.The execution of the menu was not up to it. One of which was the wine paired to the meal was not done accurate and secondly, we were not offered coffee or tea in accordance to the menu
5
The restaurant has a spectacular view of the financial district and the bay area. More importantly they have an excellent menu with great food and wonderful service.
5
I was surprised that they toon notice of my note and gave a birthday surprise to my Fiancé at the restaurant. It was a wonderful experience as the food is great and hence it is worth the price :)
4
Zafferano offers a brunch every first and last Saturday.. and it is really worth the price.There are four courses, but within each course, there are at least four dishes to have.For starters, there are oysters, fried seafood basket and other raw dishes.Then there are four types of pastas to choose from.. including its signature risotto.You'll be stuffed by then, but wait, there is still the main course, either a chicken for two to share, pork or beef.After that, there is dessert.. a whole display of them, including tiramisu and cakes. go for the affogatto as well
5
Came here with a group of friends and we got the private room. The service was fantastic - I didn't like the chairs at all in the room because they were saggy and bad for the back - so the waiter came and changed the chair for me. PerfectLiked the degustation menu that was $130 for 6 courses. The canapÃ©s were standard but really liked the waffle with salmon and avocado. The food was well executed & good but not stand out spectacular - but all put together in the degustation menu it was perfect and had all the hallmarks of a well curated menu. View of course was good All in all, would certainly recommend this place again

Had lunch on 3Sep with clients. I had mentioned very clearly to the waitress that I am vegetarian and she readily offered a few dishes which were marked "V" in the menu. I requested for cream of cauliflower soup and mushroom risotto. The soup was served fairly quickly, but after a few sips I found that there were many pieces of prawns at the bottom of the bowl. When I called the waitress, she said that she thought I ordered the soup from the set menu which is not vegetarian. There was no sense of apology. After a while, the risotto was served, but it was not the mushroom risotto, but saffron risotto with rice that should have been cooked for a couple of minutes more. I decided there was no point speaking to them and quietly ate the meal since I was pressed for time. However, I did tell them that this is not what I ordered. The response was "yes" we realised!! The chef came later and apologised but that was just before I paid the bill! This is not my first time at Zafferano. Service was consistently bad on all my visits. Don't waste your time at Zafferano if you are looking at fine dining Italian and good service in the CBD area. Try Oso, Garibaldi or Procacci - food, service and ambience are much better than Zafferano
1
We went there for a romantic dinner for his birthday. We took the tasting menu: the portion were very very small and almost nothing in the glasses. However the dishes were very good, except for the foie gras. Also the atmosphere was not very romantic.. There is a bad acoustic inside and it can become very noisy (even if it was not very crowded). I will not go back to this restaurant
4
There's a couple of rooftop restaurants with amazing views in Singapore but which at the same time look like night clubs: striking lights and irritating beat music. Therefore it's difficult to review them just as restaurants. The situation reveals also aspects about the market which is stigmatized by fierce competition and need to appeal to different target groups. Zafferano (like some other restaurant nearby) is an example of this. It has a bar in the middle of the restaurant under red neon lights. When sitting inside you can't see the magnificent view. To see that you must go outside under the open rooftop and hope that it's not raining. The food itself varies from mediocre to excellent but the venue itself is not a restaurant at least by European standards. Zafferano got a new team some 8 months ago and is now trying to raise the bar and take the restaurant to next level. Difficult task but I think that they go into the right direction. The service has approved and is attentive. Chef Marco is doing well in the kitchen and is truly interested in client feedback. With the primi and secondi, with drinks and a bottle of wine (Cloudy Bay S$120) the whole evening cost S$360 for two. So the prices are on the upper side
4
I glad to book outdoor seatings for the Ndp preview. And found location is excellent as facing Marina Bay. Especially can see the fighter planes & the stunning fireworks that is pretty near in our sight. The awosome team makes us feel comfy, with a pleasant Indian manager and his great staffs, the Chinese entertain us well & help us to capture great moments at Zafferano. Its was a 4 course set menu. Personally prefer the lamb chop than the sea bass. The choc dessert is yummy! I can see that the dining tables is limited in indoors which look quite spacious. Its better to book in advance to enjoy the meals up there
5
We had the most amazing evening at Zafferano last night for the SG50 rehearsal (and my birthday)! Jennifer the assistant manager did a fabulous job of organizing everything for us. The view from the moment we arrived took our breath away. We had the most fantastic waiter- Eric- who managed to make us feel we were the only couple in the restaurant although it was busy. The food was delicious. Such exceptional and friendly service is difficult to find in Singapore. Well done Zafferano! We will be back very soon
5
Zafferano is well known brand around the world and its offering in SIngapore will not disappoint you since it si located on the top of Ocean Financial Center and provides the 360 Birdeye view of Singapore and the CBD. Pasta are especiialy well presented and i had many guests wanted to come back for it. Wines are good and good offerings for deserts as well
5
I visited here for drinks in the terrace bar for the first time tonight with a friend for her birthday. We were blown away by the amazing prices & fantastic customer service-we will definitely be back!
5
We had the 5 course dinner for my wife's birthday. The food was great and the service was exceptional! Very highly recommended!!
5
Went there for couple of drinks: free flow prosecco for ladies for $20 on Thursday till 8.30! Other prices are also ok.View is amazing.We ordered a selection of bar food, this was really good as well, especially the pizza (burrata?). During the evening they also served small pizza pieces as a free snack. Waiters were very friendly but it can take some time before you can get their attention and serving (especially when it is more busy)
5
I was invited for a Samaroli whisky tasting event combined with a dinner in Zafferano. First time here you are impressed by the ambience and the service. The 4 course menue was selected to match the whisky and that was well done. We had a seafood entree with langostino, tuna tartar and sea urchin followed by a lovely tagliatelle with milk lamb ragu. Main course was duck breast with asparagus and a reduction of whisky. The dessert was a great apple and pear crumble . Very nice food splendid service and reasonable priced- will come agai
4
We stumbled across Zafferano and stopped in for a drink. We were delighted by the view, the atmosphere and the prices. The staff were lovely, but service was slow. It was almost half an hour before we were asked for our order. When we ordered a second round one of our three drinks didn't come. We tried for round three but no drinks arrived at all. This won't stop us going back, but I would hope that we could get service to match the view next time. We didn't eat, but the food we saw looked good
5
Triple excellent for the restaurant. The ambience which me and my partner love so much, cozy and intimates, with a great night view of the city.The foods, we order the Cod, it was crispy outside and tender inside with a perfect blend of the mushroom and sauce. The lamb which cooked in 2 ways is really tender. My highlight is the dessert that I had which is Strawberry soup with aged balsamic vinegar. It's very unusual for a dessert to have balsamic but it reduce the sweetness of the strawberry and not overpowering the taste.Last but not least, excellent service from the staff. They are very observant, they know how to top up your drink, when to clear your plate when you are done and always explain the name of the food when presented to the table. We love to have Mia who provide an excellent service during the dinner
5
Iâ€™ve been to Zafferano several times on different occasions, lunch with girlfriends, family dinner one Saturday and party dinner with friends. i can tell you i really enjoyed myself at all times there. The food is very good (especially new menu which they introduced recently), the service is quite fair, sometimes impeccable, sometimes a bit lacking but very good in general. The ambience and their terrace that what i like the most! Fantastic view over Marina Bay add the beauty to the great experience of having a wonderful meal in a wonderful place. Highly recommend!
5
I ate here with a large group fro work. The food was absolutely delicious, the service was friendly and quick, and the restaurant is really nicely done. There's a large bar in the middle surrounded by tables, it works really well for either large groups of individuals, it has a really warm, atmospheric feel, and is no doubt wonderful for drinks as much as dinner.There's a great terrace outside with a wonderful view over the city, and plenty of seating and standing area, our group has a lot of smokers so we spent quite a bit of time out here.Overall, this was a wonderful place, great atmosphere and food
5
I was here over 6 months ago, and I enjoyed everything: ambiance, food, view.I came back and if possible the food was even better! I was with a party of five for lunch, we had entrees (burrata with tomatoes and asparagus with egg) and they were excellent. And then we had the amazing ravioli di burrata, a delicious dish. To finish we had caramello and tiramisu, also great.Two days later I came back with a party of two, and tried tagliatelle ai funghi porcini and the pork ibericus. Both excellent. Given the location, the service, the views (absolutely amazing, amongst the best in Singapore), this place is not to be missed. I paid 100$ per person for the first meal (one bottle of wine) and 75$ the second time (we did not have wine and shared the entree)

My third visit at this place and I finally get to see the view because it rained the first two times. The view is awesome both day and night. Have a drink outdoors and then move inside for dinner. Love the truffle fries. Free flow proseco and bite size pizzas on ladies night! They did not get 5 stars because they allowed unauthorized transaction on my card when I lost it that night. Er... Check the signature pleased?

Very nice and excellent value (well, at least in Singapore) for Italian fine dining. The restaurant is located in 40+ floor, so you can enjoy the skyline during the dinner.

Zafferano is our 1st stop for Restaurant Week. Food was good. Service was good as well. The Sommelier choice of red was good as well. Nice place generally.
5
Set on the 43rd floor, the view of the Marina Bay area from here is absolutely stunning. The interiors are well done and the area on the outside is just perfect for a weekend evening drink and dinner. The service is excellent and the food is good. The pricing is not expensive and with that view out the big windows, its one of the best places I've been to Singapore, with ambience as a major scoring point
3
The service varies a lot in this restaurant. On the other hand the sommelier / head waiter was very service-oriented but the waiters need more training. The food was just OK compared to my expectations. And definitely not even OK compared to price!Wine list is extensive (and expensive).However the view is spectacular. If you are going make sure you book your table by the window

Very very good service , excellent ambience and views even on hazy day. Compared to other places we have visited during restaurant week the level of food on offer here is very good. The seafood salad was very fresh and good portion size. The pasta and lamb mains both had decent flavour but we're let down by being served cold to lukewarm. The creme brûlée was truly excellent and one of the best I've had in a long time. This experience although not perfect is good enough to merit a return visit. Oh and pretty good espresso served
4
We went as part of restaurant week, the set dinner was very nice. The atmosphere was lovely the staff attentive and the view outstanding, we weren't rushed but everything moved quickly. The cauliflower soup was good and sea bass they were maybe a little small portion wise but seasoned well and the desert was good
5
This was my first trip to Singapore and had been told about this place, well it did not disappoint. The view from the cocktail bar was fantastic, and the drinks were reasonable (not like a well known bar across the bay). The menu was great and the food and wine exquisite. Service was attentive but not overbearing. Had a wonderful time with my friends.

This place serves nice Italian food - but be ready to spend a noisy time there. It feels like a club, not like a top of the line restaurant. Everyone there is making so much noise like it's a pub and even though I was in a separate room, an exclusive room for our guests, the noise was not merely filtering through - it was blasting us. In between, some good food was served. Nothing to rave about, some decent Italian fare
5
we went there last night late for a drink and we ended having a wonderful dinner with a great bottle of wine. The service was one of best that we had in Singapore so far and the view is definitely the best. Amazing 270 degrees around Singapore. We will come back
1
I had high hopes but as soon as I walked in to a pumping bass line & bright lights I knew this was not the restaurant for me Every time one of three doors opened to the bar/club next door the decibel level increased. The rest of the time it was just a continuous dull thud - not conducive to a romantic evening.The food was ok but not great. We left before dessert as the music was so loud If you want a great Italian avoid this place & go to Senso. There's a reason this place was two thirds empty on a Thursday night.Terribly disappointed
3
Great views - good for guests from out of town. The service however for the main meals at lunchtime came a bit slow so I am not sure I would come if in a hurry. Good was ok but not great value for money.

It was a surprise Valentine's dinner by my boyfriend.I wasn't expecting a lot before that but once I stepped in the restaurant, immediately blown away by the dim red lights and round bar table in the middle. Not to forget, the beautiful and classy ambience.Despite during this peak season, the service and the food maintain at it's best.We went for the second session at 9pm to avoid the earlier crowd.We had Valentine's Day 5 Course meal and I love all the dishes especially the main course; Grade 8 Wagyu striploin. It literately melted in my mouth. The Challan duck ravioli was something difference yet it was very good. The restaurant is filled with couples, hence the atmosphere is good which is not too noisy. After dinner, we headed out to the open air part, where we have a magnificent view of Marina Bay Sand and other skyscrapers. It can be little windy outside so ladies, please make sure the wind don't mess up your hair like mine. It is definitely one of the best restaurant I have ever visited so far. I had a good and memorable Valentines Day dinner

I went there to celebrate my Mother's birthday.==Ambience==The ambience there is good. I like how the place is peaceful, does not play too loud music that is deafening. However, it was spoil slightly later of my dinner due to a noisy large group who sit next to us.==Food==The food is good, we ordered the duck liver, it is awesome. The doneness and the taste is perfect. Can't be better. My parents had the salmon burrata, the seasoning is good. For main course, my parents had the Black Angus beef. We requested for medium and the doneness is done perfect. For myself, I had the ravioli, can I just say I simply love it. The skin is not too think, and the amount of filling within is just nice.==Desserts==Their tiramisu is perfect. The mascarpone cheese is just nice, not too sweet or bland. Love it!==Drinks==They have people who love their wines within Zafferano. My mum is recommended a perfect wine that goes well with her black angus.All in all, we enjoyed our experience. The customer service is very good. They gave my mum a small cake for her birthday. My mum loves it
4
The Italian dishes were excellent. I would recommend going for one of the homemade pastas. The ravioli with stracciatella cheese was delicious, the cheese formed part of the sauce once the ravioli was broken. I find that pasta dishes can sometimes be heavy but the ravioli was light and fresh. The view from the restaurant is great and even better from the outside bar area. The only downfall was the service. We had to wait a long time before we could make an order and often struggled to get the attention of waiters despite the place being relatively empty when we were there on a week day
4
We started at Zafferanos to start an evening with friends to enjoy the view. We were surprised to the the first to be there and had the place to ourselves for about an hour. Cocktails are served outside on the 43rd floor where you have a fantastic view of Marina Bay. We enjoyed a great bottle or two of wine as the sun set and the lights of Singapore shined on. This seems to be a hidden treat that I will enjoy on my future trips
5
I have been to Zafferano on two occasions and the service staff have proved to be one of the best among the Italian restaurants I've visited. Great ambience and scenery, perfect for a girls' night out. Their house wines are also excellent and value for money! One of the managers, Jack, surprised us by recognising and addressing my by name just on my 2nd visit! I'm a big fan of the Tuna Tartare at Zafferano, simply one of a kind..
5
International staff supported by an excellent view of the City of Singapore and food. It is definitely a special occasion restaurant given top end pricing with entry level wine at around $120 per bottle. Also it is not for those expecting big portion sizes as definitely quality not quantity. Enjoy dinner and take in the harbour light show
5
My husband brought me fir dinner to Zafferano. Both of us were very impressed with the foid and service. Nice warm decor. Good choice of wine. After dinner we enjoyed the great view over Marina Bay from their open terrace. The place we definitely will come back soon..
5
As me & hubby will be away overseas separately for work. So we decided to go Zafferano for early New Year dinner. The food was amazing & worth every single penny! The Italian cuisine with a twist was Amazing. And the portion & final touches they put on the food was impressive. The service rendered was splendid with friendly & attentive staff always there to treat us like King & Queen. In particular the manager Mr.Ian the level of service provided was above & beyond our expectations. He really made us feel like we were celebrating the new year even though we were 2 days ahead. The ambience is so romantic & gorgeous , with beautiful scenic view of Singapore. It's sad that we just found out about this place....because from now onwards We will be celebrating all our occasions here
4
Brought an overseas friend to Zafferano and we were delighted by the experiences.The staff were helpful and attentive towards us. We made a couple of requests to the dishes and the kitchen was accommodative.My personal recommendation: lobster linguine.We proceed to a couple more drinks at their terrace bar. Magnificent view along with nice music. The crews at the bar were really on-the-ball. One of the nice roof top drinking area with good view.I am coming back for a couple more dinners
5
We enjoyed a wonderful midweek dinner at Zafferano. Sadly, because of rain, the outside terrace was closed, but we were sat by the window with wonderful views out over the bay. As soon as we looked at the menu, I knew we were in for a treat as virtually all the dishes sounded amazing. This is high quality, fancy Italian food, and it is delicious! Portion sizes are modest, allowing room for 3 courses and a very nice bottle of wine. Service was friendly and helpful, admittedly on the relaxed side at times, but staff were always responsive when we asked for something. I would definitely go back for a special occasion
5
My Singapore office is just across the building where the Zafferano is located. I was intrigued by my local Italian staff told me how they had found this amazing Italian restaurant so close to us, and how they had eaten there several times, always finding food and service amazing. Then I read the comments on TA, which go from 1 to 5 stars in the space of just few days. So I decided to go there for lunch with a party of 12, from 6 different nations (Italy, Singapore, HK, UK, USA, Russia). The verdict was unanimous: WOW. Being lunch, we only had entree and main course; my main course was an amazing burrata ravioli, quite a difficult dish which needs to be prepared attentively and served as cooked. It was perfect. The location, the place, the views added to the whole experience. The restaurant itself is super beautiful and the views over the Marina Sands Hotel and the bay are spectacular. The bill (730 euro, i.e. 60 euro per person) was more than reasonable given the quality of the food and the place. Being lunch and a working day, we had only one bottle of wine, a nice Soave by Pieropan, and as stated we had only a two dish meal, so for a dinner event the price is surely high. But in my opinion is money very well spent. Finally: I noted that many of the negative comments were aimed at the service. I found it to be reasonably good, of course it should be faster for a lunch meal. But such quality of food demands a very good preparation, and some delays can be expected. In any case, we did not have complaints

Sponsored a business lunch for 9 colleagues that took almost 40 minutes to be served, impacting our busy afternoon schedule. Restaurant is also lacking sufficient staff to cover tables.Also made a simple request to add some grilled chicken breast on top of a pasta dish (to get some protein), offered to pay more. The waitress went to kitchen and told me the chef said it couldn't be done. Said I should order a second main course instead. What a huge rookie mistake and not consistent with a 5 star restaurant. My office is in the Ocean Financial Centre and I offer take clients for meals and drinks at Zafferano. Have spent 1000's of SGD there. I will give this place a miss going forward .Another case of a beautiful venue that won't have a long future if it continues failing customers.Thumbs down on the Z!Mark W

situated on the 43rd floor of the financial center, the restaurant offers fantastic views of Singapore. The bar is really nice and spacious, the restaurant is also spacious and quiet ( if you live in Singapore you know it is rarely the case !) and well decorated with open kitchen and cellar. The food was really tasty and the staff very friendly and helpful
3
Great location on level 43 in Financial District and a really good space. Well fitted out with plenty of seating, bar area, outside deck and a pretty cool private dining room. Loved the show kitchen. However, food was not really anything to get terribly excited about. Wine list was excellent however. Service - sporadic. I wouldn't be rushing back there necessarily. Singapore has so many good restaurants and to be good you just have to rise above the pack. Zafferano doesn't do that, but it could if it worked on the food and service proposition a lot more.
5
My wife and I recently went to Zafferano for dinner on my birthday and had a wonderful meal. Not only was the food really top quality, inventive italian, but we were looked after very well by Antonio and his team, and I had a really interesting discussion with the sommelier about NZ wines (which I am very keen on) and their Italian counterparts - both of his recommendations were excellent and complemented our food brilliantly
1
Recommended by our concierge - & very disappointed. Service tried too hard, & food was not up to the prices. Special veal dish 'prepared table side' was actually done about 20-30' away for some reason. Veal was ordered ' med rare' & came 'rare' & too uncooked to eat. Had to be sent back. Great view was blocked by their bar & lots of red light 'blocks' that became bothersome after awhile. Very disappointed & will not go back
1
I was told by friends this was the place to go while visiting Singapore. What a disappointment.Food was average and very expensive. (Pasta was cold and under cooked for example).A very grumpy expatriate lady greets you at the bottom of the lift. You are then waiting for a second greeting at the entrance of the place, despite it being quite empty. The staff repeatedly removed dishes before other dinners had finished even when told not to. They forgot to set the table properly, and one had tyo wave arms repeatedly to get attention for more water, or missing condiments etc. The bill was more suited for London dining yet the food quality (excessive fatty lamb, etc) was just not good enoug
4
Good all round experience fun and friendly staff,with a good quality menu. Good space in between tables so feels roomy , great view outside with a fun bar for the afterword crowd. Food quality was good with a good set menu. Timing of the side dishes we ordered was off, ie 10 minutes after the main course had arrived - not good ! , but they apologised and were gracious about it. Desserts were tasty and coffees went down well. Mostly a work crowd,but that's to be expected in the middle of the CBD.Would comeback for sure

Restaurants sitting on top of office buildings are usually not our options for weekend dining. However, we went to look for our old friend Paolo, the new manager there, who served us very well at his last restaurant in MBS.We didn't expect much, especially there were mixed feedback on the internet. We went anyway! It was not crowded for a Sat dinner, compared to the places we usually go. To my surprise though (I must say it was a big pleasant surprise!!! :) , the food was very very good ! We had appetizers, pasta, main and dessert. Can you imagine how satisfying in the end of the meal? ha ha ... foodies like us!Service was very good too. Thanks to Paolo who took great care of us! He is really a wonderful host and always makes us feel at ease and comfort, even though it's a new place to us! THANK YOU PAOLO !The view is awesome of course - another unexpected aspect of going up to a cold office tower on Sat (feels like going to work!). Walah..... nice setting, and clear unblocked views. We found a new favorite place for Sat dining now

I wanted to set and share a romantic diner with my husband to quick off the week.We made it this Monday August 11, 2014 on top of Singapore with Zafferano! My friend recommended me the place for its setting (open terrace penthouse bar),the view (skyline of SG) and most importantly as foodie soulmate, the menu (italian food for the eyes, body and soul)!The appetising promise was 100% fulfilled. I wanted to taste every single piece of antipasti, primo,secondi,dessert in this comfortable low key and welcoming high end italian restaurant.We finally went for the squid salad, home made agnolotti filled with oxtail,roasted pistachio on top and celeri puree at the base, and we finished with chocolate lava cake with fresh strawberries and custard cream...my eyes and my mouth are still smiling at the delicious memory!Zafferano is a place I warmly recommend to every gourmet who want to create a moment to remember with family or business partner

My family and I visited Zafferano for the National Day Parade Dinner on Singapore National Day night hoping to catch the fireworks and have a great night out. We were allocated indoor because all outdoor tables were fully reserved. Surprisingly the management had specially allocate an outdoor terrace area for all indoor diners to view the spectacular fireworks! We were amazed by the move if not we would have missed the great moment. This particular area could have been easily sold but in order to provide an extra service to the indoor guest, management had made this great move!!!Service is absolutely fantastic from the moment we came in until the end , staff are very knowledgeable on the menu and our special request (glutin free meal for me) was well took care of despite it was a very busy night.The set menu that we ordered started with marinated oyster, followed by lobster salad than pasta with seafood and perfectly top with good quality Botargia. The main course was a choice of cod and lamb which are soft and tender. .. perfectly cooked. It take a while for the dessert to be served but totally understandable for its standard and quality. The manager apologized a few times for the delay and the friendly chef dropped by at the end of the night to talk to us. Apparently the pasta that we had is south Italian style, a private recipe from the chef's grandma!!! We had the wine pairing as well and the sommelier takes time and carefully explain the wine notes and the reason of each paring! At the end of the meal the Italian manager who took our order offered us to continue our night out in the terrace. A cocktail called Prima Signora with flaming alcohol on top is served to us this made us feel very excrusive! It was such an amazing experience and definitely worth the $200 all-in-bill per head ;) Which is pricy but all well spent. We will surely be back again for the great food, 5 stars services with the best breath taking view in town. Top it up with no cover charged which many places do just for the view itself!!!Well done Zafferano

We had a dinner on the National Day of Singapore. It was fabulous: very nice 5 dinner course menu with pairing wine, very friendly staff, suitable music and ambiente with a great view of the city. We have enjoyed our Saturday evening. Highly recommended if you want to celebrate something special

Called months in advance to make reservations and ask for a window table for NDP fireworks. Was assured of such a table in every single phone call. Imagine my shock to arrive and find my table not beside the window. Staff said to get manager who took a long time to show up while I stood there waiting and they continued sitting guests at the windows. Manager said he can't do anything for me as tables by window was full n I was stuck at that table with not much views at all. That was the last I saw of the manager. It's bad business when what was promised was not delivered and nothing was done to mitigate. Service continued to be poor throughout. Refills of water was not automatic and we had to keep asking. No kids utensils though there's kids meal. Asked what the dessert for my kid's meal was, 1) was told it was a variety of items. 2) then, was told it was tiramisu (for kids?!). 3) then, was told there was no dessert in the set meal. So, I asked for menu to order. 4) then, was told it was ice cream. Amazed with how clueless the service staff can be. Some were friendly enough but still clueless. Food was average. Ambience good only if u r by the window. I m unlikely to visit again.
4
The service is excellent. Staff was very accommodating as we requested to change tables twice. We had a great view of the Marina Bay and the view of the fireworks that were displayed during the National Day Parade rehearsal. The outdoor area is suitable for chilling out (accompanied with lounge music) while the indoor area has posh and elegant deco. The food was so so though. The mussels were cooked to perfection which was moist and not at all dry and hard
4
Fantastic Location. Great looking restaurant. Layout is pretty great. Great italian food as well. Nothing too fancy. Good old fashion Italian food done well. The lobster bisque was a highlight for me personally. and the service was pretty damn top notch if you are asking my opinion. Tuna Tatar was tasty. Seared Scallops was not too bad but COULD have had a few more Scallops for that price. Had the Duck/Truffle Parpadelle which was a little heavy but still tasted amazing. And the Lobster pasta was made perfectly. No complaints. Also, any Italian restaurant that has Bottarga on their menu is top in my book
5
This is a must visit restaurant with the banking crowd entertaining their high flying clients.....in short - good food at high prices.We were there as a group of 11 friends and had a private room allocated to us. The views from on top of the Ocean financial centre are breath taking. We started the evening having drinks outside in the open area.We then moved on inside to the private room. The meals were largely preselected from their set menu which made ordering much easy for a large group. The food was good and the service standards very high.We concluded with drinks outside again in the open area accompanied by some great Cigars and wonderful conversations with friends.Overall a great venue with a great view with good food and was perfect for celebrating an evening with great friends - if you don't get upset by seeing a huge bill when the party ends :-)I enjoy reviewing restaurants and Hotels and hope it helps others to be better informed. I hope you found this useful

The Zafferano is located in the business district, so most of its patrons, with their black business suits, tend to come in here for their after-work drink before heading home. And why not? For where else in Singapore can you be out on a glassed-in atrium terrace, on the 43rd floor, sipping, amidst luxurious tropical foliage, a happy hour $8 (Singapore dollars) beer, looking at the city lights legendary buildings like Fullerton, and the lazy spread of the river and its Quays below.The dining room is also glassed in, so the city lights, though more distant, stay with you as you are seated. The wine list, as the food, features Italy. We choose a full bodied Merlot from Tosca vineyards- quite distinctive in its bouquet,as it warmed our mouths from the very first sip. The starters were delicate- a small salad with rocket lettuce and cherry tomatoes, a side plate of sliced baby potatoes sauteed till brown, a buratta in a tick creamy sauce, and an interesting spinach with burnt garlic. The portions leave enough room for the main course. My main course was spaghetti with sauteed duck.My dinner companions ate spaghetti with buratta sauce. The portions, though not large, could be shared. We just had to request for extra plates.The quality of Italian food was excellent- which is more than what I can say for most Italian restaurants in Singapore
4
We arrived to an outdoor terrace at the restaurant for pre-dinner drinks, where high ceilings and glass windows provided both a good escape from the humidity and a fantastic view of the city. Staff were quick to take our orders, but otherwise left us to our conversation and we appreciated the lack of interruption. After, while seating us for dinner, they were also accommodating in our request for a change of tables, when we wanted more privacy with a corner booth table. All orders (including starters) were served with an explanation of each dish and I personally enjoyed my generous serving of lobster spaghetti. Food was obviously of top quality, but prices are slightly on the high end.Will revisit when there's an occasion to celebrate and I'm looking forward to trying the white asparagus next
5
As you are ushered through the turnstyle of an office building it feels like heading to work. However once you reach the 43rd floor that's soon forgotten. Opt for a pre drink with what must be one of the best views in Singapore and enjoy the really great food. On a Tuesday night the staff were very accommodating with a 4 year old and provided ice cream and entertainment. Lobster spaghetti was top notch, although the london version of the same restaurant still has the edge
3
We went for a dinner on the night at May 30th at around 20:30, when the restaurant was certainly not busy at all. After were seated things went down the wrong way from a service perspective:- we had to ask for extra bread even though we've ordered a starter, which certainly would require some bread (three sorts of Italian ham)- we waited for almost an hour for our main courses and only got attention because we've actively asked for it so it rather appeared that our order has been forgotten- we had to ask for pepper for the steak and some parmesan for the pasta as no one either asked or brought it- we had to pour our own water and wine from the bottle as no one paid any attention to our empty glasses- no one ever asked if the food tasted ok or not and the empty plates were just taken away without any commentAt the end of the day the only positive experience was the food, which was indeed excellent yet at 400 S$ there is clearly a great mismatch between the food quality/price and the service! Based on the recent reviews it seems not a single appearance, which is sad and doesn't motivate to go there again as there are clearly so many other good choices out there...

Great view from the bar, not so much from the restaurant. Disappointing service (except for one of the bar staff), expensive.Went there for drinks and dinner on a Monday. It was quite farcical....1. Arrived, walked outside to the bar area, was seated by a waiter but no one came to take our drinks order. Had to wave down another waiter to order a drink.2. Waiter went to check if our table inside was ready but never came back. Had to wave down another waiter to check. 3. Seated for dinner, I ordered the chicken and an additional side of potatoes. When the dish came out it already came with potatoes. I told the waiter to return the extra side of potatoes. Upon ordering, the waiter should have informed me that my dish already came with potatoes.4. The mains were expensive and my dinner companions main meals didn't come with any greens, potatoes, sides, nothing.5. Whilst we were in the restaurant we received a text saying that we hadn't turned up and that our booking had been cancelled!6. We ordered Mumm champagne which we were informed was on special but they used the full price on the bill. Got this fixed. Lucky we checked the bill.7. A waiter started ironing table cloths in preparation for the next day whilst we, and other patrons, were still eating. We politely asked him to stop. It kind of ruins the atmosphere - having a guy ironing beside you. He was polite and stopped but was a bit mystified saying they did this every night at that time.The owner/manager needs to provide more gentle help, guidance, and training to the well-meaning but not ‘on the ball’ staff. More a place for friends or business, not so much a romantic setting
5
I was entertained there by a business associate, and was very positively surprised following the mixed reviews. The Gourmet Set lunch was awesome. I had the Langoustine bisque soup followed by homemade tagliatelle with smoked salmon, and greatly enjoyed the both dishes as well as the dessert. At the end of the lunch their new head chef, Marco, came down to the dining room to greet the remaining customers. Very good lunch overall, coupled by the nice busy atmosphere in the restaurant and great views of the Singapore skyline. Well done

Was really looking forward to a lovely Valentine's dinner at Zafferano, especially as I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while. I was majorly disappointed from start to end. We arrived on-time only for the lift doors to open to a massive queue of other customers (all with reservations) waiting to be seated. After a 45mins wait in the queue, we were finally seated only to wait yet another 15mins before being given the menu. Ridiculously slow service - this is how the night went. Although the staff were trying their best to speed up the service, this led to them running / dropping cutlery / spilling water etc. Not the premium service that I was expecting out of Zafferano. On top of this, the environment was severely unpleasant as customers around us were all complaining. Even saw a couple get up and leave before their mains were served. Really not the kind of environment you want to be spending Valentine's evening in. Other than the burrata ravioli (which was delicious), the rest of the food was not good at all. Definitely not worth the wait or the money. Thought for the appalling service/ridiculous wait, we would at least be compensated via a free drink or % off the bill but no such thing. Severely disappointed by the whole experience
5
We went to Zafferano to celebrate my wife's birthday recently. The Burrata was the freshest and the best I have tasted outside Italy and the Carpaccio was melt in the mouth. My wife had Cheese Ravioli which was to die for and I had the Tagliatelle Ragu which was very good as well. Unfortunately the generous portions left no room for the great Panna Cota I had tried on an earlier visit, and we had to wrap up with the espressos on the outside terrace enjoying the dazzling night skyline of Singapore! We are coming back soon
5
I had a dinner at Zafferano on a very busy Saturday night. It was my second time there, and I was impressed with the changes. The restaurant was full, and the ambiance was very vibrant. Apparently, they have just launched a brand new menu few days ago, and the food was very solid. They offer a fairly large menu with many varieties from Hokkaido scallop carpaccio to veal tenderloin flambé and many more. We have tried a few appetizers, soup, pasta and a main course, and all dishes that we had were very good (Spanish Octopus was fantastic). Service was not great but adequate. Very decent wines by the glass. I believe that Zafferano is one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore, not to mention that it is a rooftop location with a terrace and fabulous views. I will certainly be back again
3
It's been a long time since we experienced such a slow meal. Even the bread arrived half way through the appetiser. We had to wait over 35 minutes for the main course and the pork cheeks that my wife ordered was more like a poor pork hot pot. We decided to leave without desert which is unusual!Oh well, strike another one off the list.
5
We chose this place as we were looking for a rooftop with a great view but trying to avoid very touristic sports at Marina Bay Sands. We didn't regret a single second. This place is so chic and stylish!!! The view is amazing! The ambience is great, especially on the terrace, and you may even smoke there!!!The food quality is surprisingly good, before I thought the places with a view don't care much about food quality, but seems like Zaaferano does.Surely should' t be missed while in Singapore
5
My boyfriend brought me to Zafferano for a pre Valentine day dinner. Actually the dining room was filled mostly with couples and the atmosphere was very nice and romantic. It was my first time there and I must say I was very impressed. But not only with a view and setting but mostly with food.Everything I tried, Super fresh burrata, pasta with lobster and chocolate lava cake, were excellent!!!The service was ok for Singapore standards, sometimes very attentive, sometimes not easy to get attention.I think it's a great place especially if you start your night with a glass of champagne outside. The view is amazing, the dj is good, the food is excellent. What else do you need for a great night out? Definitely will come back to try more of their Italian delights
2
The people who sat next to us, having arrived 20-30 minutes before us would probably not recognise this review. They had a nicely paced and enjoyable meal. We on the other hand gradually watched the service disintegrate. It was Valentines Day, my wife's been away and I've organized a special meal to celebrate being together again. We arrived just after 7pm having been told quite clearly we need to be finished by 9pm. However, by 8.30 we were asking when we would get our main course. In the previous 90 minutes we had managed to get our starter and some pasta, both okay but no more. We also managed to get some bread having asked 3 times. They had tried to poison my wife insisting that she had ordered scallops and not beef carpaccio (she's seriously allergic to fish).When we did eventually get our main courses they had clearly been rushed. The pork cheeks tasted more like school dinners. My rack of lamb was three little lamb chops with a smear of aubergine paste.By this point it was after 9pm & we decided to cut our losses and leave having spent $380 on a disappointing evening at a restaurant that had made little effort to make the event special. A shame given I had eaten there before and the buffet lunch had been particularly good
3
Went for the 2 course lunch set at 39SGD++. Minestrone soup was nothing particularly special, although the main course (sea bass) was quite reasonable. Drinks were well priced: $6 for a Tiger beer or $8 for a glass of wine. Views were impressive.
5
This is a very good place to eat in Singapore.
The food is very nice, beautiful ambiance, and the view is amazing !
I Will definitly come back.

I eat here regularly at lunch as the set lunch is good quality and value. A group of us had a chance to have dinner last week and enjoyed one of the best Italian meals we have had in Singapore. Wine list is good and reasonably priced.

Service staff ratio is way too low. Couldn't get any attention for service. took 3 hours to serve a 4 course meal. Eat here if you have lots of time. DJ us horrible. First course was over cooked.

During my business stay in Singapore we went for dinner at Zafferano. When going up to the 60th something floor, you already become curious about what will be showing up behind the door. The view is breathtaking (though when it is raining you will get wet outside). Dinner at Zafferano was good, quality of the food is high and the open kitchen shows the dedication the staff puts in preparing the courses

My husband had entertained staff here for Christmas and was impressed so he organised a night here while in Singapore with me, and I was not disappointed. The service was faultless, the 2 waitresses we had were at the top of their game. The food was spot on, the gnocchi, Mezzelune and lamb were good but the ravioli was amazing, it melted in our mouths. We had the Zabaglione and lava cake for dessert, and they both topped a really great meal very well. The views are sensational, it was a wet night but that didn't matter, it just added to the ambience.

Great view, great steak, good service. Wine-by-the-glass machine a nice touch, but nothing in it that caught my fancy. Wine list too pricey (but aren't they all in Singapore??). Corkage is S$45.The burrata did not taste especially fresh or flavorful (but kudos for having it on the menu). Agree with many other reviewers that the Fiorentina steak (to share) is absolutely outstanding.An extremely nice feature is the terrace, just outside the main dining room and with panoramic views of Marina Bay. The restaurant is on the 43rd floor, and the terrace's atrium is open to the sky (which I think means you can have an after-dinner smoke? Not sure.

It really amazes me that out of all the steaks I've tasted in Singapore, Zafferano's Fiorentina steak was a top 5 I've had. Surprising find in this Italian restaurant not known for steak.Absolutely spacious and professional, Zafferano is an excellent spot to bring business clients. Service might need a bit more work, but since its always not packed, I don't think getting attention should be an issue. Try the Italian buffalo cheese as well- Burrata pomodorini datterini e basilico. It will blow your mind with it's stringy, stretchy texture and creamy taste

Located on top of the Ocean Financial Centre, right smack in the middle of the Central Business District, Zafferano is a good find. I have one recommendation: Tomato and Burrata Ravioli. Explosion of warm burrata cheese contrasted with a tangy tomato sauce. Don't skip dessert. We had hazelnut chocolate thingie (sorry, can't quite describe it) sort of like fudge which was great and the strawberry compote, a great refreshing finish! Definitely make a reservation and dress smartly too :):

I have lived overseas for many years and in Singapore for one. I have recently discovered Zafferano amazing restaurant and I wish I had found it earlier. I am Italian and I had not found such delicious taste of home in Singapore until I tried Fabio's and Andrea's creations. Ever since I have tried their food I have recommended Zafferano to all my friends and business partners, and they obviously love it too. Fabio's cuisine delivers the truly genuine taste of authentic Italian food - no fusion, no frills - with a very beautiful presentation (the small pots are very appealing besides keeping the food warm). Everything I have tried from the starters to the mains was just perfect. Andrea's desserts are to die for. And they are beautiful. Of course all girls like desserts but his are different because I can taste that they are made fresh and using only the very best of ingredients. I have the feeling that he may hold back on sugar and butter because I can always taste the rest of the flavors rather than feeling numb because of the sugar. My friends an I love the classics but every time we try something different that becomes our new favorite. Oh and the bread!! My friends and I love it!! The sourdough, the grissini, the focaccia.. amazing stuff! Last time we were at Zafferano we were 5 people and I think we had 5 servings. They should open a bakery to the public. I'd love to get the same bread at home. Enjoy

Absolutely fantastic, the best Italian in Singapore, amazing food especially dessert, Andrea the executive pastry chef is outstanding !! Thanks for the lovely evening!
5
Very well designed, great atmosphere, excellent food both from the bar and the restaurant, wonderful view from 43 floor. Never let me down when I took friends there!
5
I recently celebrated my anniversary there, and your team made sure that we had a fantastic time. The service was amazing, the food and wine excellent, and I look forward to going again.

went with 2 dearest friends, had an awesome experience . Ambience was superb! friendly service staff, reasonable price, and great food. We've tried the salads, and lasagna was delicious...and what a perfect lunch to end with the yummy apple tart. Absolutely , the place that should not be missed
3
Ambience: Restaurant setup is casual and it's very noisy. Alfresco area is chill Food: scallop for appetizer, it's has nice combination with Bacon. Lamb rack, requested for medium but somehow was abit overcook and the food was kinda cold when served.taste wise, was.kinda blend, it wasn't thumbs up. Dessert: had Choc larva, it's not the usual soft larva. It has few layers of different texture, the cast is hard Which I don't like it. It wasn't fantastic either but unique.Overall: would return for chillout @ the alfresco area for the beautiful Marina bay vie
5
Went with hubby for a nice mid-week lunch. We got there early which was nice to beat the work crowd. We both had the set meal. Both our main courses were wonderful and there was plenty of choice for appetizers and dessert. Everything we ate was fantastic. Would definitely recommend and go back

Zafferano in Singapore has a commanding view of the city from level 43 of Ocean Financial Centre in Singapore's central business district. At lunchtime, Zafferano offers a set lunch, which includes an appetiser and dessert buffet with a main course squeezed in! The appetizer buffet consists of a fine spread of cheeses with various condiments and nuts, salads, breads, cold cuts, etc. For the main course, there is usually a vegetarian option. I've found the staff helpful and willing to accommodate certain customizations to the dishes. Do call ahead of a visit as there are significant savings if you have an early or late lunch outside of peak lunch hour. The view from Zafferano of MBS and the floating platform is beautiful at night and the a la carte menu should have something to satisfy all tastes. Excellent place for business meetings and entertaining. Only downside is that the tables are sometimes pushed too close for comfort, inhibiting free discussions. Otherwise, a fine restaurant to dine at

Dined here twice - once for lunch and then again for dinner. Both times, service and food were very good - particularly the 'home made' lasagna and tiramisu. Lunch crowd - as expected - is strictly business. The prix fixe lunch is a bargain combining an extensive appetizer and dessert buffet with a main course selected from half a dozen choices. For dinner ate 'outdoors' with probably the best views in the CDB overlooking MBS and the floating platform. The restaurant was admittedly quiet on the weekend, but I suspect this will change given a renewed promotion effort combined with several new chefs. Food quality is very high compared to other rooftop restaurants in Singapore most of which charge dearly for the view, but fail to deliver adequate cuisine. Certainly a very solid place for business entertainment if you want to impress and equally nice for a family dinner. Note the restaurant's reception is located in the ground level lobby of Ocean Financial Centre after which you take an express elevator to the 43rd floor. OFC is within walking distance of The Fullerton and Fullerton Bay hotels

I am fortunate enough to work in the Ocean Finance Centre and feel that this really is still a well kept secret. As noted previously the quality of the service and food would suggest that this place should be very busy but, as the management have been appraised, there is a real need to ensure the market is aware that Zafferano is open and publicized.I have always found the food of a very high standard, consider the lunch set (buffet anti-pasto, choice of entrees and a desert buffet) to be excellent value for such quality in Raffles Place) and am always impressed by the efficient and knowledgeable staff - such a rarity in Singapore. Engage Michele in a discussion about Italian wines and be prepared for a lengthy and interesting discourse.Oh and yes - there is a stunning view to add to the pleasant ambiance and cuisine.I recommend Zafferano highl

The view is spectacular and a great place for a bar......so why is it empty. Friday night, 6pm and any self respecting roof top bar in Singapore will be heaving. Even the very poor Altitude gets full. Lack of advertising. I have never seen any. I only know about it because I work in the building. Setting excellent, charm good......champagne, not the best. Oysters were ok but marginal and the sauce/dressing pretty poor. Mini burgers were very nice though and they sell Tignanello by the glass. Only 2010 but still, being one of my favourites it gets my vote for wine by the glass. In fact it was a glass here that converted me. I now have a fridge full. Have been 6 times and overall it is good, but there has been the odd event.....

Their scenic view and strategic location are already an advantage. However, i find the service somehow lacking and the food was just average. I am certain that they can still do better. There is a great potential for them.

I had a business dinner at the restaurant. It was my first visit and my business partners made the reservations so I have no expectations.The place is pretty nice. There was a reception on the ground floor and we took a private lift to the restaurant which is on the top floor.We had a table indoor but they have a private deck outside. Both indoor and outdoor have a very good view of the Marina Bay area. Very nice to enjoy the view while waiting for the food.The food unfortunately disappoint. It was really so-so. The bill was paid by my business partners but when I was looking at the menu I noted that it was quite expensive. The service was pretty good. Staff was responsive and very professional and correct. We were there on a week night and it was quite quiet. Very suitable for a business dinner where some discussions can happen or for romantic dinners.Will I go back again? Not on my own as it is not value for money

We arrived at about 1:30 pm for lunch right after we landed in Singapore. We sat down and chatted for a while. Our host then invited us to take appetizer from the buffet table. while we walked out, one of the waitresses talked to our host. there was a mis-communication in which we were under the impression that we could either choose from the buffet table or a la carte menu. So we decided to choose from the a la carte menu and we sat down to look at the menu. It was close to 2 pm and some of us preferred to choose only one course. However, the waitress bluntly told us that it was compulsory to choose at least two courses. We then realized that there was a set lunch in which people indeed could choose appetizer from the buffet table and a main course from the menu (same as our host originally suggested)! Then we walked out again to take the buffet appetizer. Although there was a wide spread of choices on the buffet table, they did not appear very fresh, maybe it was close to 2 pm and the food had been there for a while. I chose the pesto pasta as my main course - it was a bit too creamy. My friend chose seafood risotto and it looked nice. Despite of the experience, we had a good meeting with our host. The restaurant has a very nice view. However it was a bit too noisy for business lunch because the tables were quite close to each other

I usually do not write a review if everything is OK but visiting Zafferano on Saturday after a dreadful Italian dinner on Friday makes such a contrast that I decided to put in in writing.My wife and I went of a light dinner and it was not our first visit to the place. The service was fast and non-intrusive and the food was perfect. We both have different risottos as main dish and were very pleased with our choice. The vine list is quite pricy but the advantage of Zafferano is that you can try a good vine by the glass from “vine-machine” that keeps wine fresh. So instead of going for a bottle we went for a glass of a really good one
2
I previously ate at Zafferano in September of 2012 on the rooftop patio - it was fantastic, really a memorable experience with great friends, wine and music. It was so great that I insisted on bringing some work colleagues for dinner this week .....I literally became a pariah because of my choice, the service is still good (as were the appetizers), however the main courses were really lacking (one colleague didnt even eat his fish .. he left it). My shortrib was obviously cooked in such a rush that it was chewy (shortfib needs slow cooking!) ... the steak looked nasty (I had it last time and it was just fantastic ... this time it sucked). The place was empty (mind you it was a Tuesday night) where as last time I was here in September it was just packed (it was a Wednesday!). Hope they can do a bit better in the future, it is a great location with a great patio

My girl friend and I visited Zafferano and had a wonderful lunch. the new a la cart lunch menu, which is small but had good options. I had the "Vitello tonnato" and she had the "burrata" as starter. Both were delicious, only the second course I was a bit concern on the portion of the black cod. I belive they could upgrade a bit. Excellent service, my wife loves the manners and touch of the restaurant manager. Nice ambiance. The location is next to the Financial centre. We'll be back soo

We visited Zafferano for lunch during Restaurant Week on 20 Mar 2013.The restaurant was full (lunch hour on a weekday), but the service was attentive. Since it was Restaurant Week, there was a set menu with 2 choices each for Starter, Main Course and Dessert.The food, when it came, was done course by course for all 3 of us, so we could all start eating at the same time without waiting for each other. The portions were generous, and the food was delicious. The manager came by our table a few times to ask after us, and we appreciated that he took the time even though it was lunch rush-hour.Overall, an excellent experience. Pity we didn't get the chance to go out of the restaurant to enjoy the view (it is 43 storeys up)

My husband and I both enjoyed our evening at Zafferano. Service was very good, staff were well informed regarding the food and were able to answer our questions efficiently. The meal was served in an unhurried manner so we were able to enjoy each course then relax and talk for a bit before the next course arrived. Food was excellent. Our appetizers (Tonno and Burrata) were flavorful beautifully presented. The ravioli pasta was freshly made and very tender; although the lobster stuffing was a little fine in texture and seemed a bit briny which overwhelmed the flavor of the lobster itself. My husbands short rib was flavorful and very tender. His gluten free requirement was well accommodated with a wonderful bowl of stewed strawberries with candied oranges for dessert. The tiramisu dessert I ordered was one of the best I've ever had, it was smooth, creamy, light and all the flavors were well balanced. We were served a complimentary shot of Limoncello which was a perfect end to a very good meal. This is the best restaurant meal we've enjoyed in Singapore since moving here July 2012. Zafferano is a restaurant we'll return to again and again. We'll definitely refer Zafferano to our friends and associates

Celebrated my birthday here, the view outside is breath-taking. I came on a weekend, so the restaurant being situated at Raffles Place was rather quiet. But I enjoyed the peace. Service was good and not intrusive. Food was decently-executed, my bf enjoyed his beef cheeks and said it was amongst the best he had eaten. My sea bass was decent but not out of this world. The tiramisu was okay, but nothing memorable. However, I find the food value-for-money for a fine-dining restaurant. We ordered a soup, 2 mains, 1 dessert and 2 wines and it came up to $180. A good place to visit when there are special occasions, or just come here for drinks (

Celebrated my wife's birthday here with my sis-in-law and her husband. This restaurant is located on the 43rd floor and offers diners a fantastic view over the Bay Area. We were there on a Saturday night and glad to see that there's not many people in the restaurant. In fact we were the first to come in for dinner. Food was creative and the service commendable. The servers went their way out to ensure we have a great time there, including some very nice surprises after our dinner. They explained every course to us and the manager asked for our opinions on some of the dishes too. Personally I find the foie gras with chocolate a bit weird as I prefer a fruity combination along with the foie gras. It's sweet for the chocolate combo. Portion was more than adequate as we need to cancel some orders while we were mid way through our dinner. Price was very reasonable considering the quality of food, service and great views from the restaurant. Definitely a place for a nice Romantic dinner with your loved ones.

A shame it was raining that night we were there and weren't able to sit outside. Still, the food was spectacular. We were also disappointed with the staff responsiveness.

Great view and it can challenge the view from Marina Bay Sands. The patio area is too hot because of all the glass but they have improved with large fans.

I Had dinner in zafferano with my colleagues in a working day: nice welcome and nice table with a great view.The atmosphere was very relaxed, firstly breads were light and well flavored and seasoned, we all chose a 6 courses degustation menu at 128 Sin $, food was excellent, heavenly pasta, tasty meat dishes with a nice super sauce finishing with yummy desert. On their own right the best for me it was the foie gras with dark chocolate, the sommelier was good and fair and he recommended fantastic red wine from Veneto

Have a drink on the terrace before dinner (or lunch, although it may be too hot); the view is one the best in Singapore. The cooking is decent; there are many Italian restaurants in town with much better food. Service is ok - as with many restaurants in Singapore, service quality is usually lower than the standards of the establishment, due to labour shortage. We were in a private room, otherwise the atmosphere may be quite dead, with only a few occupied tables for dinner on a week night.

Went for a business lunch on a Wednesday, restaurant on the top floor of Ocean Financial Center so the location is very good for business people.Nice view and ok service and food.the interior is bit confusing and doesn't have really a line. big bar with table around. food tastes ok, nothing special, starter from the buffet which most comes from the can, mains you have a good selection and dessert again buffet. wine selection is big but some wines we tasted where off even though they informed us they're using a machine which can keep the wine fresh, which sadly wasn't the case.all in all nice place for the location and view, rest need to improv

Celebrated Christmas eve with partner at this place which I had heard and read so much about. With the excellent reviews in place what can go wrong....actually a lot will go wrong. To start with, service - for a fine dining place, service was lacking. Food were placed on the table without any explanation on the dish and dishes were served too fast, as if they were rushing to get me out of the place (mind you I actually requested that the servings be spaced out). My complementary champagne was poured before I even read the menu - call me fussy but at least askme first if I am ready for my champagne. Food wise, average taste for expensive meal. I paid a total of SGD350 for a 4 course meal for 2 including 1 glass of red wine each. The main problem I had was with the steak. It was just so-so and I could get better ones for SGD10 at Aston's. View from the restaurant is great. But the management cannot count of view alone. The food needs improvement and staffs to be trained well. Singapore fine dining has never been famous for its service quality but this restaurant could try to be among the better ones rather than below the average....Will only return when they improve. ..certainly one of the most expensive and unsatisfying meal for me. As a comparison I paid SGD400 equivalent for a 7 course meal for 2 with a bottle of wine at Alyn Williams in London (1 Michelin star) and about the same price for 7-course meal for 2 paired with wine at Launceston Place in London, another 1 Michelin star restaurant. I truly enjoyed my meals there...

I have been there with a friend and we were placed in the middle of an empty restaurant. Yes, it was during the week but at least we could have been asked especially as we had a reservation. However, we ordered something to drink as aperitiv and had a look at the menu which seemed to be quite reasonable. We have chosen a few dishes so that we had a 4 course menu each. The starters were okay... the risotto (served with over 45min waiting time) not at all!!! Even the signature dish was overcooked. So we waited for the main course which was Steak with Foie Gras ( big piece just dumped on it) and pork loing which was undercooked...and it continued the way with a disappointing dessert. The service was lousy and seemed not the be interested in customer. We better dont talk about the person supposed the be the manager. The wine selection is nice but overpriced. Overall, almost S$600 for 2 person and the biggest disappointment I had in the last couple of years make me warn other people

New restaurant on the top floor of Ocean Financial Center. View is great and service is very friendly but -as nowadays normal in Singapore- not really good. The decor is a bit all over the place. They have a nice open bar in the middle of the space that constantly changes color by means of up-lighters. The rest of the lights are mostly LED and have not really the best color rendering. Food looks a bit flat. The restaurant is too bright and lights are only focused if you sit at the window, the other tables are lit randomly, but you don't come for the lights, you come for food, which was quiet disappointing in my opinion.Started with a Spinach Salad that was a bit soggy and weird in taste and than had the Merluzzo which was not really up to expectation. All portions were actually quiet small and come on strange plates. We were there in a group of 8 and the feedback was average on the food.Will probably not come again

Great tasting food @ Italian restaurant on the top floor of the new financial center. It always feels a bit strange to walk into a office building at night but this restaurant makes up for it with the quality of its food. Music is a bit loud and the view difficult to sees from many tables, other than that a solid experience worth having. Good service and nice birthday surprise

Had a nice evening at Zafferano on 13th Oct 2012 - as part of the Restaurant Week. Environment and Decor was very nice . They have a kind of open Kitchen concept which is unique for a restaurant of this class Staff were always very friendly - but rather Inefficient ....... i asked for water 3 times before i was served . And surprises surprises ..... my glass of wine was served after the 4th request !!!! Taste of food and the presentation was good , but i had greater expectations The manager was friendly , he came and discussed our Menu since we had a veg Menu request Later we were serviced by this Italian gentleman who was rather lively and stopped by our table a couple of times and made jokes ... also later at the end of the meal he served us some Limoncello , unfortunately i forgot his name The dessert was very interesting , tasting portions of 5 desserts ..... including the best Tiramisu i have had Everyone was always friendly but the serving staff was slow and unattentive .Parking ..... this is a problem : There is no access to the parking lot , and a Valet service is provided at SGD 12.00 , which i think is out of line . Being such a high class restaurant , Either they should provide parking spots or should organise the valet at subsidised costs or even complimentary. Someone may state that if u cannot afford this kind of valet fees u should look at cheaper restaurants ..... but i state that it is not about affordability but about the level of service you expect from such a high class restaurant .... I ran up a big bill even for restaurant week promotionI tried to discuss this with one of the hostesses in jest , but she was curt and dismissed me off . Does not leave a good tast
