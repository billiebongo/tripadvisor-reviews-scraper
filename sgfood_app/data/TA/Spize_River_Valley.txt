A very popular place which stumps me. I had food there twice and do not get why this place is so popular. Though, they do have a great extensive menu which looks very tasty and interesting. Yet to be impressed.
2
Me and my wife are always here coz she really like the food..but the service here is rediculous!!
I finished all my food but my drinks still havent come..
4
Opens till late night and offers everything from snacks which makes it a great place for late dinner.Awesome service nd good food spot on with the hygiene and the priced is very reasonable.Will definitely visit again wen I feel hungry at the night.
2
Expected more/better. Waited over 30 mins for one main course, all rest had already finished. One dish was quite poor.

If you looking for an excellent halaal restaurant to eat in Singapore then spize is that place. Awesome service. Amazing food and spot on with the hygiene and priced very reasonable
Will definitely visit again

A good bonding place that looks warm for a bonding lunch among colleagues. Overall its is a nice place. Waiters were attentive. Food was good but not awesome enough to deserve 5 stars.
Thank you, guys!

We booked a reservation for 13 people . so when we reached , we did an advance order, we informed the waiter to serve the food when all the other guest had arrived. the server was not paying attention to us and seem very restless. Then minutes later, to our surprise,the server served all the advance order dishes!!!! In addition , we have children with us, so we ordered aglio olio as per the child request but we instructed the server to make it non spicy for the child. the server replied yes they can do that. when the pasta arrived, it was damn too spicy for the child to eat! Aside from the aweful service crew, We had been calling the call center for than 4 times, initially before placing the rservation, we were assured by the rude call center staff that the reservation fee will be refunded on the day we show up for the reservation at river valley outlet,but even after we left the restaurant, they never refund the amount to us! when i called the call cente ragain, the lady informed us that the money will only be refunded after 48 hrs!!!! All these information is very misleading and incorrect. Had I known the service is so lousy to this extent, i would have NOT booked for anything for this restaurant! but definitely, my family and I would not be going back to this restaurant

Not a nice experience AT ALL. Food is good but service is very bad and not friendly. They try to let you order to much and aren't helpfull but pushy...you order and they say...and else...so you feel that you haven't ordered enough. At the end...waist of food and when I told them that ge should have warned me....stupid response...nooo way overrated this restaurent...better go somewhere else...unfriendly enviriment...didn't see one smile. Never go there again!

I ordered online & request 12pm for delivery. They arrived at 11.51am. I missed their call for 5mins when I called back the rider had left my premises. The rider sms me and said, he will only wait for 5mins. Else he will go off as he got other orders to deliver. I called him at 12pm sharp he was not there. I was taken aback with his customer service attitude. Not customer always right. We can apologise, but please be considerate we need time to wait for lift and need to walk to the pick up point. At the end,I have to wait 40mins for my food to be delivered.

Spize River Valley opens till late, and offers everything from snacks to carb-packed meals, which makes it a great place for a late dinner or supper, especially before/after a movie at the nearby Great World City. There's just so many things on the menu from Roti John and Prata, to Maggi Goreng Thai and Nasi Ayam Kunyit, through to steaks that sometimes, it's just hard to decide what to eat. But not for me, because I've got it figured out: Go for the Nasi Goreng Ayam Kunyit, that's probably the best thing on the menu in terms of portion, taste, balance, and value. Pair that with a Teh Halia Gajah and you're filled until lunchtime the next day
5
for me i could get my halal menu over here. too much people come and so you just be patient to get your table. oyeaaa this place so recommended its bcause you will get the good food with the good price.
2
One of the floor staffs mistook my order for something else and was rude & even argued with me. Very very disappointed and pissed off.
Their food and price are ok, but they really have to step up their customer service.
4
Another outlet of Spize located at River Valley which is walking distance from Great World City shopping centre ...love the varieties of choices and the food is halal so great for gatherings...
4
The food here was good. We had the nestum crayfish. Its not bad but could be better. The salted egg squid was awesome. Highly recommended. Mixed seafood grill was ok. Murtabak was good as well. On overall, this is a good place to have good food. Would definitely recommend it
4
I had dinner here with my colleagues and was quite satisfied with this restaurant. They offer many cuisine from Asia to Europe, so this is good for anyone cannot be familiar with Singapore cuisine. I have tried the crayfish and ice cream for dessert, also shared some foods with my friends, all was delicious. Service was fast and friendly, and I was really satisfied with them. In addition they could deliver foods to office if requested, and I have tried the Asian and Thailand food box, very good
3
It was our first meal at Spize restaurant we ordered couple of dishes. The waiter brought us tom yam soup to start with, which was pretty good. One of the waiter brought wrong order and left it on our table. We instantly told the management and they apologized, however, the waiter who left the wrong order came back and started questioning as if it was our responsibility to tell him that order was not correct. His behaviour was rude and spoiled everything for u
3
Was given a treat on one quiet weekday evening and found the Rifle Range club Spize extremely beautiful and had a lovely ambience. Went there again last Saturday Afternoon with the family of 10 and was truly dissappointed with their staff's attitude and service. Not only we had to wait for someone to take the orders and had to keep calling each waitress but to told off. Just Wait! but the looks of their faces showed as if - you shouldnt be here!! and - we are just fed up!. goodness it was really embarrasing to be shrug off with their rude remarks and service. I doubt we will ever visit there again.
3
We went here at about 0300 hours and it was two other tables being occupied. The menu was too extensive. It took a while to choose. Instead, I told the waiter what I wanted and he found the appropriate menu option except he added items that I didn't ask for. We ordered the stingray, just to taste it, and it didn't taste fresh at all.I woudn't revisit this place
5
Tasty Local Food in a clean non-air conditioned setting w/ fairly mid-range prices. Extensive menu difficult to choose what you want. Non-Alcoholic Drinks like Milo Dino & Godzilla taste quite nice at this joint. Halal so perfect for office gatherings too for lunch. The vibes def quieter than Bedok Branch. Nice takeaway drinks counter at the side too.
5
It's a crowded place to get good food. Have been here several times in the past consuming bangers and mash, rib-eye steak, kway teow and hummus. But this time we're on for a repeat on kway teow and hummus. Serving has been improved, having it served on black plates of all shapes and sizes, compared when it was just starting up, which is a huge plus.Of all pictured, hummus stood out the rest. It's texture is creamy which blended well on the olives that comes with it. Hoping for more serving of pita in the future to rationalize the serving.My ever-favorite kway teow comes out too soft this time making the noodles stick together. Satay is dry but the sauce made up for it. The spiciness of chili overpowers the lemongrass on the prawn tom yam.Overall, still a pleasant dining experience for the price we paid.
2
Service was poor, not enough plates or glasses given had to be told twice, food was very good, not cheap either. Just seemed like the staff did not appreciate customers.
2
Restaurant has been revamped and decor is great, but quality of food has dropped, and the place was uncomfortably warm.
4
The spize restaurant is an old time destination located at river valley road. The menu has a huge selection and suitable for people with varying palettes. I tried the murtabak and loved the flavours.
5
This is my nth time dining in this restaurant,my family & friends love to eat in this place, excellent and very tasty food, great service and good crew, highly recommended to any prospective customers, accessible place, value for your money!!!

We originally came to this restaurant two years ago and remembered it fondly only to be disappointed on our return trip.Initially when we turned up, we were asked if we had a reservation. We hadn't so we were told we would be seated outside which wasn't a problem. Except, the waiter put 6 chairs there whilst there were 7 of us in total and then walked off.We were sat for at least five minutes trying to get the attention of the waiters for the menus. Yes it was busy but we would rather have spent that time perusing menus. Eventually we asked someone who first asked if we had just come and sat there (no!) and then plonked some menus down and walked away.We had ordered a large bottle of water and what arrived was a large glass of iced water. This was somehow to be shared amongst the group with no cups provided although it had been made clear when we ordered that the water was to share. Three plates were then given - again there were 7 of us. Attempting to ask for more plates seemed a mission in itself! Finally we were given more plates and cups to share the starters.The food then arrived- both starters and Mains together. Whilst the siracha and honey glazed chicken wings were delicious (for which we wanted the plates), other dishes were not quite as we remembered.I had highly recommended this to friends but wish I hadn't - it's lost its sparkle for us
1
Something is really wrong with this place now. The food used to be fabulous for a reasonable price. But now prices have been jacked up 25% from just 3 years ago and the food is so terrible that the last few times we went, we could not even finish half of it. What also made this place great was the joy and the fun the staff were having amongst themselves. Now they just walk around like zombies and though they are polite, are absolutely joyless. We use to bring our friends from overseas here to showcase 'Singaporean food' but now we wouldn't dare! If the restaurant doesn't bring back joy in its food and its staff, this place is closing in a few years for sure
2
During night shift,me and my colleagues would order spize for supper. I just feel so pissed with my mee goreng seafood. I requested for no veg and extra spicy. But what i got is totally opposite. Mee goreng seafood but only got 2 prawns and less than 5 sotong. There were more mini cabbage which I mistook for sotong. Really so disappointed cause this is not the first time my order got screwed . $7.20 for the mee goreng seafood but i feel that i had mee goreng veg
3
Nice cozy place. It gets really busy and noisy. While it's cosy because of the lights but not the best place for quiet discussions. This is basically a modern version of an Muslim food restaurant but with a full international menu as well. The Indian Muslim dishes are very good but the western food is good in presentation but lack in taste. Overall a good place, too many dishes in the menu to fail terribly.
5
We went with a big group for lunch and I had the Moroccan Roast Chicken - what a fantastic plate! The chicken was succulent, veggies cooked to perfection and so many delicate flavours in the jus, that I had to ask for the recipe. Chef Imran was great and very responsive, as were all the other staff; well done, we'll return soon
3
We ate here a week ago with my family - 3 kids, 2 adults. First impressions weren't fabulous - the waiter was more interested in finishing his conversation with the other waiter, than welcoming us and finding a table.Again some issues with the waiter when ordering our food - had to repeat multiple times, and even then he missed a drink order.My food was good - dried chili cashew nut chicken and rice, and other enjoyed their noodles stirfry and pasta. For some in our group the food was too spicy - but hey, that is the name of the restaurant
5
Every time i'm in singapore, this is one of the list..
The food is great, and also the ambience.
It's spicy, but not to hot.
It is a good choice especially for muslim traveler.
5
Tasty
Fast
Great noodles
Good staff
Nice interior
Friendly to non halal people
Simple food done well.

Came for a late breakfast and wasn't disappointed. Ordered so much we barely could eat lunch later in the day. The Pranta was SO good. I wish I could find some here in NJ.
5
Excellent dining experience, highly recommended to any prospective customers. Value for your money!!!!
5
Recommened to try the nasi ayam goreng with a milo dinosaur.
Perfect combination makes for 2 light eaters.
And best for heavy eater espicially on the go.
1
The waiter couldn't understand what I was trying to order. I had to repeat myself multiple times. The place wasn't even crowded and we waited quite some time for our food. When my food came. It wasn't hot and my burger was extremely dry. The standard of food has dropped tremendously since the first time I came here.
4
Great little restaurant tucked away in a quiet corner of River Valley Road, with an eclectic menu featuring southeast Asian, Indian, Chinese and even western dishes. Given that, it does a commendable job on this far-reaching, ambitious menu. Good decor and service. The drinks, a bit pricey, are good too
5
We walked in without reservation and was lucky to have a seat, was there around 5 - 6 pm. I ordered vegetable briyani and it was good with super huge portion. Chap cai was nice and flavourful. Nasi lemak was also good. Ordered upsize watermelon juice too and we left the place satisfied. The service was prompt and fast. We have no problem or complaint and we are happy with the service .
1
I made an order for a seesh kebab at 3.05am. There was not much crowd. I saw others who came later than me getting their orders served. I got little worried and annoyed for the delay. When asked the person in charge about my order, he was surprised that I have made an order. He went to check my order and told me that it will take 10 mins to ready. I went to sit and waited again. I went back to the cashier counter again and this time it was another person and queried about my order. He told me that they have just started to prepare! That me furious and angry. I canceled my order and left the restaurant to another nearby restaurant to take my meal. As I planning to eat for Ramadan, I was short of time and hungry. The last time I had a good preview of this restaurant but their standard had dropped drastically. Worst service! I could have given a negative rating but I can only select one for this review.
4
Keeping it short. I tried the Crayfish Mee($19.90), quantity was utterly generous with 3 half-crayfish in a large bowl of thick soup. Moderately spicy. We also ordered Penang Char Kway Teow($7.20). Requested for extra spicy, and it came as expected. Generous with gravy, not a single thing wrong with the dish. Amount is also worth the price. Finished it all off with spicy drumlets. All-in-all delicious meal we had. Full of flavours. Nothing was wrong. Fell short of no ingredients at all(in our opinion)Definitely recommended. Also suitable for families and you can try several dishes together. Expect to pay: ~S$15-S$20/person.

Happy to have made reservation using Chope! Although I came earlier than the booking time, Spize was able to accommodate us! Thank you 🙂
5
Food was awesome. Staff was friendly. Eventhough quite squeezy due to 18 of us that day. A bit warm.
4
Cosy restaurant with halal certified food. Can be better if staff are more attentive. Food taste and servings are just nice
4
i visit this restaurant because i see the long queue so i got excited to try, and the tase pf food just amazing for all menu witn great location
3
Food is very good, and price is no expensive. The service must be improved as well, order is too slow and miss our add-order.
4
The staffs who took our orders are friendly. The 10 pax space reserved for us were thoughtful and comfortably chosen in the restaurant. Our reservations were still on even though there were some changes to our bookings last minute (few hours before).
5
Awesome place with awesome food. Ambience was great, service and staff was exceptional, couldn't complain.
4
Quality of food sometimes has no standard.
The restaurant cleanliness is quite bad, table and glass sometimes are very oily.
1
Hot stuffy with aircon almost useless. Chope reservation system require prepayment. Restaurant was not sure if the prepayment should be used to offset bill. Ask me to go seek refund from chope while they charge me full bil
1
Ordered delivery from their Spize website at 7pm, received a confirmation 10 min later saying that my order was accepted at the River Valley outlet and I would receive it at 8.30pm. By 9pm there was still no delivery so I called the customer service line to find out where my food was. Was told to wait again while they checked what happened. In the end I found out the outlet had somehow never received the order due to a 'glitch' and I would have to wait another hour for my food. This would mean I would only receive the food at 10pm and my family was already starving. We cancelled the order.I received another call directly from the outlet, apologizing and saying they would expedite my order and waive the delivery charge. I really can't believe they expected me to wait another hour for our food. 10pm is really unacceptable when we had placed our order at 7pm. No one also had any satisfactory explanation for the glitch, especially when I had received the order confirmation.Will never patronise this chain again. Beware if you ever decide to place delivery orders in case your order ends up in Narnia as well
4
My son had the grilled chicken and cheese murtabak followed by their awesome Milo Godzilla aka Milo Dinaosaur + a scoop of vanilla.
I had the seafood tom yum which had just the right amount of "heat".
Just wished that they didn't charge for water.
3
Had the maggie goreng pattaya. It was alright. Tasty but mostly oily. Could do we more meat. Portion is huge thou.
4
Very efficient service. The food was well made & the recommendations were spot on.
The sambhar type daal they serve with their food was very tasty.
4
My reservation was correctly display and was ushered to my table within mins even though it was full hse.. food was good and large portion
5
Amazing local and Malaysian dishes. Tasty as they sounds! Penang char kway teow is a must try. Western offerings are average.
4
We went for dinner on a Monday night without reservation. Stood in the Q but was given a table inside quite fast! We had Nasi Goreng Ayam (so sedap!) and Seafood soup with Salted vegetables. Soup was yummy, generous amount of fish and squids, but no salted vegetables! The waitress who served us was friendly and prompt to give us the extra bowls, without us asking for them. I can't wait to go back to try the other food
4
Resturant in River Valley Road, after Zion Rd Junction, has an impressive menu to just about cover all tastes. Western, Indian, Chinese n Fusion. Fried rice, sambal kangkong (Malay), Tom Yam noodles (Thai)Sweet sour fish, char kway teow, Fish-n-chips, pizza, just to mention a few. Was really surprised at level of my taste satisfaction. Prices are above the "cheep" level, oh ok if u must "cheap" .... but way below exorbitant levels. Cosy premises, aircon n free wifi too. Parking can be challenging though in side lane past the resturant. Crowded in the night hours, (I hear say)
3
food was quite good. the lack of alcohol is a bit of a bummer because its halal. but we knew that going in, which was a good thing. lot of food options. the place is very busy so the staff may not always be the most attentive. what was most disappointing was having to cut the murtabak in pieces ourselves and when we asked the waiter to have it cut for us, he simply said - i will give you a knife. which was disappointing. but overall, not bad
2
I used to live close by and Spize was a regular haunt serving good, affordable fare. Upon a recent visit back I was dismayed and disappointed at how its changed. The place as revamped from shop house hawker and morphed into a "proper restaurant". Along with that change the prices appear to have sky rocketed. The food was always reasonably priced but that's no longer the case sadly. I'd now rate this as signicantly over priced. Sad to see a Singapore favourite fall foul of the endless need to change (not for the better)
1
Waiters are useless, service is painfully slow. Waited over an hour for food and then ended up cancelling. Many tables that arrived after us were served. Very confusing and no communication. Manager was not apologetic at all and wanted to charge us for the dishes we were still waiting for. If you can't handle the amount of customers then don't let them in! Avoid the spize
4
Been here for many times with my friends after work and always look forward with their yummy food! Best place to chill after party😊
5
The food variety is great. It is also relatively affordable. I certainly enjoy it with my date that day.
4
The food here is good. It's good value for money and has quite a bit of options. No alcohol though... which is a bit of a bummer. But regardless, I'd definitely go there again.
2
Food took 45 minutes and had to remind waiters three times about it. Food was barely edible. Order Nazi lemak and it tasted like it had been made in a microwave. Only decent part was the single tiny fried chicken wing.
4
Never disappointed in spize foods, esp the usual teh tarik! Always good for a late night catch-up!!!
4
Spize River Valley serves good food with good service. The ambience is pleasant. The menu has a variety to choose from.
4
always our to go for the good ol artery-clogging grub. a favourite would be their tissue prata drizzled with thick condense milk
1
I ordered online bedok outlet as they have variety to choose from.Emailed was send to me to say that food confirmed order received but Staff called in to say i can only order from river valley which has not much choiceSuch a disspoinment staff was unprofessional in doing their work when customer service called me and said that 7$ delivery chrges only for river valley as if i cnt affordWhat a shame!management have to take this into account .first time ordering and bad experienced .staff came and when told there'no change for 10 cents he still insistWhat a joke 
4
Ordered the nasi goreng Pattaya... the food arrived lightning quick,was tasty and the Ngp and a cool watermelon mint drink put me back13 bucks (7.5 for the Ngp). If you are hungry want to hang out where locals do and don't want to break your pocket this is a good destination in Singapore..
4
Visited with family, was given a table after a little wait, ordered fairly easily even though we requested a dish to be made which wasn't on the menu. All food and drink arrived fairly quickly and perfectly as ordered.Most surprised when the bill came which was quite low in comparison to the amount of food served. Will definitely return
4
I and my friends come here so often because it opens until morning. I love their Ice Tea O (well, I always order the big one!!). Their nasi goreng ikan bilis is my favourite. And don't forget to order Banana Ice Cream Tissue for dessert!
5
Spize is a super rad place to go with just about anyone . I think it's particularly nice at night as it's open late and you can get so many types of food that everyone in your party will be happy .
5
Great food, good service, reservation ready when arrived, good ambience, highly recommend for couple or family
4
We wanted to sample nasi goreng and our hotel suggested Spize. Very busy place and very popular amongst students. The food did not disappoint, good service, clean, noisy and very busy!
5
Came to Spize early. But staff was nice to attend to us to give us the seats. Food was good and serving time was reasonable.
4
Able to allow us to change reservation time by 30mins as we were late. Thumbs up!
Will visit again!!
1
The food not so nice for the price and the music was so loud it feels like you are in the bar, service not good the crew has used his bare hands to packed the take away food.
4
Great variety on the menu from Indian, Malay, Indonesian, Chinese, Western and Mediterranean. Excellent portions of food served plus big drinks available for those with a big thirst. Highly Recommended!
1
I made a reservation for 12 pax on 25th Jan for 27th Jan 17. I even called on 26th Jan to comfirm my reservation. And the person said yes, it stated there, my name and the no. pax. I came on 27th Jan, the person incharge told me that my name is not on the list. He said that CHOPE didnt upload it to their system. Imagine i bring 11 people, my family members to celebrate my birthday. At the end, the person in charge said "oklah since u already come, ive got no choice but to give u seats." Im sorry, ure not suppose to say that to me. Its not even my Fault. I already book tru CHOPE. I even called ur restaurant to comfirm. Yet, ur system sucks, u dare to say "u got no choice?" Worst service ever! And oh, guess what? When i reach hm and check my email, CHOPE canceled my reservation at 5pm the day itself. I didnot cancel it. How can CHOPE cancel my reservation? I will never use CHOPE anymore!
4
I order barramundi with creamy spinach. I wish the fish served was a bigger portion. Taste of creamy spinach is slightly on the bland side. I've eaten a tastier creamy spinach at another place (sorry for the comparison). Have also order baked rice. Texture of cheese was not the usual liquidy/stretchy but tasted ok. Had pineapple and ginger mojito which was delicious. Price wise is expected for such restaurant. Ambience is perfect but I find that the seatings are too close. Location is near Great World City
5
Must try the mee goreng pattaya. You received more than what you give. I recommend this to those who love foods and travel.
5
Great place to have dinner with family. Food servings was good. Only thing is that we were not informed that the shish kebab which we ordered had a cooking time of 30 mins.
5
Awesome halal food option in Singapore. Menu had huge variety of items from Indian, Malaysian and Chinese. Chicken Murtabak and Roti were delicious. This place is open late night and is quite busy.
5
excellent dining experience, very delicious food, great service, accessible location. Highly recommended to any prospective customers
4
Lovely atmosphere with the renovated premise. Still great place to chill despite prices going up a little bit.
3
The food was AWESOME and I can't deny that. But the service was kinda slow & people don't come up to us to ask if we're ready to order. That's the down part as that's my first time eating in Spize and I was confused whether to call them or go to the counter and order. So I just asked them where do I order, and that person wasn't ready to get my order. They should have everything in their hand, so it won't be troublesome for them to go to & fro just to get paper & pen. Overall, its good. Will recommend because of the food.
3
Got here at 3 am on jan 1st to eat some food our friends said is the perfect late night greasy feast. Had murtaba and "prata". And "Maggie goreng". Interesting. Clearly a mix of influences that have give a rise to this kind of food. North Indian. South Indian. Malay. Indonesian. Interesting cocktail and a new kind of comfort food that I think deserves an audience back in india.
5
Accidentally stumbled across this gem enroute to boon tong kee.Food here is seasoned, very well priced and variety is great. For having so much variety the taste is not compromised and each visit we were as delighted as the first. Gets very busy whatever the time of day so recommend booking this place.The Thai coconut is amazing. We came back for lunch and dinner multiple times during our stay, a must go
4
The restaurant has the ambience of a cafeteria, indoor and out door seating on a street busy with traffic. Opens late hours thus a good place for a late night bite. The menu has a lot of variety, Malay, Indian, Thai, Western and Chinese, food is excellent and reasonably priced in the mid range, we have tried so many dishes and were never disappointed. The service is excellent and fast. Expect waiting time of 20 mins as they don't take any reservations. Try the local Chicken Murtabak and Roti John. Parking is available in the adjacent lane but is difficult to get. best to park at Great World City and take a 5 mins walk
5
Walked in with a friend last night and asked for a table for two. Was going to be seated outside but requested and indoors table which we were given. Albeit on a high seat. The waiter was very accommodating. The restaurant was very busy and there were people rolling in and out quickly. The wait staff worked relatively well to handle the orders. We got our orders very promptly with no issue. Spize was initially known for their prata, (they still are!). But they have since extended their menu to incorporate grill dishes, traditional dishes and more. A great variety with great quality. Great stuff! Will return any day
2
Shortage of staff and most of them were in bad mood. Waited 18 mins to get our orders taken. Our food came before our drinks (20 mins later).
Pasta & burger took 1 hour to arrive after everyone else had finished their food.
4
Would have given 5 stars if there was someone who was readily available to take our orders. I find it difficult to catch their attention.
5
Very crowded here..all food was good here..try the stingray, roti john, roti prata. Service also good.Try the milo dinosaur
5
The food was great as well as the service.The food might be a bit expensive but its worth paying every single cent😁😁
4
we ordered mee goreng, nasi goreng, char kuay teow, murtabak and some other western dishes. The local food was all delicious; western food was decent.
5
Was searching for a nice cafe for a family dinner.Read a couple of good reviews before going there. I must say its worth a visit.
4
We booked a table for 20 pax. As usual, for such a busy restaurant, we were required to place a $10 deposit per head ($200 total) to secure it. Eventually it will be used to offset the total bill. Rudi the service manager was very proactive and courteous during the procurement of the deposit. When my group came, many crews were busy and each time we call them to request for something or place a new order will be replied with "I'll be back". The ambience is great though! Food wise, their portion are fit for the big eaters. Though I feel their asian food is better, their western is not bad too! Try the Star Beef Burger. All in all, good place if you are looking for halal-friendly gatherings
4
Spize may not be a fine dining restaurant, but it offers a wide range of tasty and generous dishes, served quickly, at any time of the day or night, and in a cozy atmosphere.Great Asian meals, at friendly prices, are always good after a wild night club crawl.Just head there, you'll never be disappointed
2
A good friend stay around Spize and we came again yesterday. I could smell bad odor from the menu book...to start with...we ordered honey cheese prata yet it came without honey but currythe roti john is ok. truffle fries is so so.. ambience is darkwon't eat here agai
5
Spize on River valley Road is a must visit. It's a microcosm of Singapore food under one roof - Indian, Malay, Chinese, Western. The Murtabak is huge and yummy. The juices were good and the Ice Horlicks drink out of the world. They have a variety of desserts too on offer. One would be spoilt for choice here. Wish I could eat more 
3
food was served late and cold.
made reservations, was slightly late but table got given up to somebody else.
5
Really great experience. A lot of dishes to choose and many drinks as well. Everything is served warm and with sides. I really find it a good place to bring visits and friends.
4
We were invited by fiends for dinner here and was fantastic. The menu was extensive the drinks cold and the staff friendly. Not being Singapore locals it's always nice to visit different restaurants
3
Good food, could work more on service speed and communication. Otherwise great place to hang out and chill.
5
The food is so tasty with a really relaxed atmosphere. We are a ton of different things like parata and tofu with mushrooms. I love the murtabak mamma mia style for meat and cheese lovers and the veggie is great for vegetarians.All at a really affordable price. 5 bucks for a juice too, such a good deal in this cit

We walked passed this restaurant two weeks ago and also heard from friends about it . We made a booking on line and just as well. There was a line on arrival at 8pm and we walked right in. Service was indifferent as per most of the reviews on trip advisor on this place. The food - great ! The size - large and value for money - GREAT ! Try the mutton roti John - delicious. The paper roti - well done but could do with less sugar. Prawn nasi lemak had two king size prawns n the seafood Maggie goreng was good too. Selection of drinks was good n for an extra dollar you can upsize .
5
Went here every time I take a trip to Singapore. Value for money if you eat up the food with friends.From a small sized restaurant which occupies one shop house, now has grown into full scale restaurant with as big as two shop houses.The portion are the king here, everything can cover 2 pax of person. My favorite meal are the Seafood Tom Yum and Fried Chicken Fried Rice teamed up with Milo Dinosaur!

Near Great World City. The location is not ideal as it is not near any public transport. Only accessible via taxi or car, with lack of parking facilitiesBut it is an excellent place for late night dining. Crowded at all hours of the night A good variety of food and drinks. Western food, local fare, prata and desserts.
5
This restaurant is busy pretty much all the time and opens late into the night.It serves a broad range of Malay, Indian and Singaporean dishes. All dishes are pretty good and reasonably priced.Some of the severs English could be improved but they are eager to please and will get you answers for any questions you have. I have been many times and will surely return again
4
Met up with friends for dinner. I called ahead to make a reservation and when we got there around 6.30pm there were plenty of seats. The staff were attentive and friendly.The food came out fast and I must say the food was great. The Roti John was wow and I would recommend. We went for the chicken special. The Nasi Goreng Pattaya was delicious and went down treat. We also ordered some satays which were good and the Murtabak Mutton Keema was excellent.I would recommend this place when in Singapore
4
Place is spacious. Clean. Fast service. Cheap food but with high end dining experience. Satay is abit over price.
3
Good food. Bad service. There was one very nice lady running around taking everyone's order, while a dude in the most intense uni-brow just ran around in circles.
5
Awesome halal eatery with a great variety of Indian, western and and Asian food. The Teh Tarik full bodied and satisfying. From simple fare like the humble prata to steaks, Spize has been maintained high levels of consistency over multiple visits here.
5
Alhamdulilllah! Got nothing to complain.... Way too delicious!!! Good atmosphere and excellent service!!
3
We ordered dinner from Spize, taste was average but the meat tikka was not good at all. Meat was as hard as a rock. Other dishes we ate (Tom yum, biryani) were all good.
4
Spize must be the busiest restaurant in the Neighbourhood.
Arrive early to get a table, and enjoy a wide selection of Asian, Indian, Middle Eastern and western foods.
5
fusion food served with excellent service, an all rounder!!!
try out the fruit juice, it is value for money!!!
better still, have a dessert with the yummy gelato ice cream...
4
This restaurant didnt dissapoint me everytime I visit them for supper. Since I always order different dish to try different foods time to time. but among all the seafood aglio-olio was the best! and of course my fav. TEH TARIK ICE (milk tea) It's huge also and all prices was cheap. they serve both asian and western food which is good. definitely will come back soon! Highly recommended. should visit

I had a terrible experience last evening. The Secret of SPIZE seems to be the huge AMOUNTS OF MSG (Ajinomoto) that they seem to be putting in their food. While I understand that MSG is banned by some countries, SPIZE seems to be using this along with low prices to attrract customers who find the food 'Tasty'. Anything with MSG is 'Tasty' and can make anyone a super chef. But it is unhealhy to the core and the cause of high blood pressure and other illnessesTo make things worse I requested the server twice to get food made without MSG and he assured me that it would be done. I told him that I am allergic to MSG and he should make sure else I will not order the dish in question.When the food arrived and I had a few bites I realised that there was MSG in the foodObviously the server had not followed a simple request. I then asked for the manager and he was unavailable. I then asked to speak to the chef who came out and said that he never received any request in the kitchen to make the dish without MSG. A nice process failure that caused me a lot of issuesBefore you ever eat at SPIZE remember that MSG is dangerous and that they have no processes to take care of customers who have allergy to MS
5
Most of my friends keep on recommending this place and i did invite my friends to have dinner tonight.I must admit, we did enjoy the murtabak and nasi goreng pataya! We absolutely raise our both hands for the wonderful food. Service staff are all great most specially the guy with the tattoo.. I will definitely bring my entire clan to this restaurant again soon
5
Affordable. Huge Portions. Variations of Menu.
But the restaurant is a little bit crowded, so better making reservations first.
5
Great variety and large portions. Nice ambience but do make a reservation before heading down as the place is small.
5
Excellent service. Afforadable food, complete with nice ambience. This place is undeniably the best makan place I've been to!
4
The food is great and we love the food over there.. A great place to hangout with friends too. We will be going there again for sure.
4
Visited Spize at River Valley on 29/07/2016. Great place and great food. The waiting time for the food is short as well.
4
Spize Restaurant is really a nice restaurant and definitely i will go again. I enjoy the food as there are variety food to eat.

Very poor & horribly disgusting experience from this SPIZE OUTLET. Waited to be seated which is alright to me. BUT, waited for my dish I ordered 40 minutes ago isn't excusable. It is okay to wait for such if you are cooking a PREMIUM steak for me. BUT, I waited that long for a KWAY TEOW. Even hawker centres with such long Q you didn't have to wait this long. My partner and I were very unhappy as his food turned cold waiting for mine. He ended up having cold meals. AND, I prompted for my meals to be delivered. Only to find out, they have not begun cooking it. This is just way too much and absurd, especially if your staffs weren't apologetic for such. 5 minutes later, my meal came and this snob waiter you have did not even bother saying sorry and simply said "Penang Char Kway Teow". did you really think its worth paying for these meals? By this time, I have lost my appetite. I think all of your staffs should be reassessed with their job scope. I am not expecting a 5 star service and I really am not fussy at all, this is my first time needing to write a horrible service at Tripadvisor at any restaurants/diners I had ever eaten. Horrible. Not worth your money and paying for Service Charge. It seemed to me that service had been addressed plenty of times here in Tripadvisor with the outlet promising to do something about it. It doesnt seem like somethings being done to improve it
1
Service is way too lousy.. Staffs don't even look at you when you wave at them. They just ignore you. All the staffs should be sent back for training. I can understand it is busy but eyes should be focusing on customers instead! This is absolutely ridiculous! But food is pretty good. I will give credits to the chef but 2 thumbs down for all service staffs
4
A good spot for late dinner. I've found this place since 2012- when I was in uni and now it just keeps me coming back. Huge portions of everything and the prices are quite on-par. The restaurant is packed most of the time so believe me, if the service goes a bit slow, don't be mad as everything takes time. Our understanding would def go a long way and make a day of the staff a bit easier. They deserve our good little gesture
4
We had a company lunch there because is considered near to our office (walk is about 18min based on google map), hence we grab car to go there. We sat indoor - not too hot, not too cold but unfortunately i am seated under the air con which is dripping like every 5-8 min. We didn't change place because our group was too huge to be placed so where else. The food was fantastic.With the wide range choices of food to spoil you. Everyone should be able to find something they like.
4
Not many vegetarian options. Otherwise, an overall a nice experience for a value meal. Centrally located.
3
All mains ordered are very disappointing as noodles were undercooked and bland. Only items that are worth the value is the seafood grill platter, roti John and banana ice cream tissue prata. Rather disappointing overall.
5
Upon arriving at the destination, the staff were great and they are already expecting us and arranged a nice corner sit for us!
2
was very upset as one of the dishes we ordered did not make it to the table. worse we were there for iftar. ended up one of the family members had to share food to breakfast.
5
Ramadan feast accommodated well and servers were very helpful.
They paid very close attention as servers knew the dishes belongs to.
5
excellent food, lots of choices for local flavour, friendly environment. Although quite noisy, we quickly got immersed by the wonderful selection of food. Clearing of table was relatively slow as we need to self service since table was small, however it was a Friday evening where shop was very crowded too
3
It feels like Spize is trying to be all things to all people, serving a huge range of Asian, Western and Indian food. The serves are very large. We ordered a range of meals and found they were all adequate but not spectacular. The price was reasonable so cannot complain about value, but the quality was ordinary. Having said that, the place appears to always be bustling, but we were underwhelmed.
3
Great venue, nice to sit and have a good meal with friends and family. Price is very reasonable, well aligned to hawker place prices. Food service and delivery is good, however i thought the quality was just OK, nothing special, nothing to want to return quickly for, however i would go back, if i was with a big group and on a budget, its a fun venue
5
Food galore, from Asian to Mediterranean to Western, all under one roof. Price is abit pricey for me, but portion is good. Taste is dependent on the food that is being ordered or probably the person who cooked the food. Avoid coming from 7.30pm-9pm, especially weekends, as waiting time could be very long. Probably could make reservation, to avoid waiting. For take-away, could order online or call their hotline, and just collect within half an hour. They offer delivery too, but delivery charge is per distance.
4
For an average meal value of 15 with a drink , the menu is packed with different ASIAN , Malay , Indonesian , Indian and Mediterranean so offers a lot of choice I decided to have a vegetable soup which was large and delightful. There were lot of vegetables and each one of them retaining their crunchy character even after being in hot soup is a killer and remarkable. This mild soup is a must have. The other dish which I ordered fish with green onions looked delicious but I had to get it packed as I was full. Inspite of Sunday and pressure the staff was quite patient and attended to all guests nicely. He even waited for me to count my change while paying the bill and got the fish packed in a jiffy Must visit for Indian travellers if they are on this side
5
The Mutabak was amazing, you can watch the chef prepare it fresh. We also had a great noodles. Everything on their menu was local comfort food and very economical!
4
The food is fairly cheap and the menu is extensive! You have a lot of choices from conventional western food to local cuisines. It's a bit crowded but that's how you know a place is good. :)
4
It was quite crowded as it was during dinner and breaking fast (ramadan).
Food quantity was a lot. Unless you are a big eater, I suggest you to order a plate of the same dish.
Reserve your seats early over weekends n dinner.
4
Food tastes great. Just that took too long to be served. Perhaps Spize may want to consider expanding the place to accommodate more people.
4
Been here a couple of times after partying late and hard. The keema Paratha is mind blowing... dripping with oil but that's what you are craving for late at night after a few drinks.
5
The Location easy to find. The food is delicious, you have Malay, Chinese and western food and drinks varieties that you can order. Dining outdoor experience. Always crowded so better come earlier or bit later and best part the restaurant open till morning so after your clubbing with your friends you can eat there. Price also reasonable and they also have delivery servic
3
We were waiting for our food & drinks. No one realised we didn't even have our drinks and assumed we haven't placed our order. We kept calling the staffs and were told to wait a few times. After maybe more than half an hour, one staff finally attended to us and said our order wasn't keyed in. It was way past the break fast time and we had to wait much longer than those who ordered after us. It was disappointing for a popular restaurant. Thankfully, the food was okay
5
we booked for break fast but since only 7pm slots available we thought the food was definitely going to be late. Well the drinks were pretty fast even though it was quite full. The food took sometime about 15min -20min but the portions and taste were great... the staff were really efficient and friendly too... 2 thumbs up
3
We had our tables reserved. And I was amazed cause our tables was ready earlier than I expected. However they missed my brother's order and we have to cancelled it. We prompted the waiter to check on our order. And we were informed that the "kitchen is jammed". My brother was neutral enough. He decided not to eat and just had few munchies. Kindly double check on customer's order next time to avoid any missing orders. Overall it was good. Thank you for serving is once again
3
I don't get it. Everything about this place indicated that the food is going to be good on flavor and punchy.... The place looked great, the open kitchen was fun to watch and the generous portions of food all looked so appetizing!but somehow everything tasted a bit bland and under-seasoned.We ordered a bit of everything but looking back with should have just ordered the meat murtabak with the hottest curry they had to offer and left it at that. Service was good btw, nice staff but very busy
5
Great place to recommend for local dishes, service staff were all friendly & courteous. Love so much chicken murtabak. We will always patronize this resto. Awesome food.
4
The section that we were seated was slightly stuffy despite the ceiling fan, air condition unit didn't seem to be on.
4
Service was okay, and food portion was generally big. The nasi goreng pattaya was worth the value due to its taste and portion. Worth for a try! Overall experience is satisfying, and the food was value for money.
4
Worth it, Food are good at very reasonable price. Theres alot of variety and roti john and murtabak is good.
4
Yummy. Luscious, spicy food in big servings. Indonesian, Malaysian and Indian dishes. Served fast and served right.
The best after a night of drinks. yearning to return!
5
Delicious food , affordable price and the place is very accessible, Highly Recommended to any prospective customers.
5
I have a very splendid moment celebrating Mother's Day at Spize River Valley! It has always been my favourite place to eat. The foods the service...all are so good! Thumbs up Spize!
5
Excellent service❗️Food presentations are good and food proportion are just right. To waive plain water n ice charges.
4
Service were great, the staff were friendly, helpful and assists just whatever we needed... we got our cake in the chill, they even supply us with plates and spoons... willingly to take photo for us too 😌
5
Amazing restaurant. Yummy food. There is always a queue which is not good when you are really hungry. So do keep 30 mins as buffer :) The decor is really nice, upbeat vibe, outdoor eating, variety of dishes. Specially recommended after a night of drinking. Open till late in the night.
4
Staff to smile more, be more attentive, staff was clear to understand, customer service was fast and friendly.
5
Always accommodation to our requests. We are always there when we need a place for 15-20 pax. Service is always excellent. Food wise need to improve , but still tasty as ever
5
Good hangout place. Food was tasty with reasonable price. Portions were big waiting time was not too long although it was full house.
4
Dinner with friends. Great food, value for money.
Service was good and prompt.
Only disappointment was the availability of car park lots... Need to wait for the nearby lot or park a distance away.
4
Amazing long menu with food from all over the world for an reasonable price. Thai, Indian, Greek, Arabic, etc. you name it. Seems to be always busy so better reserve a table if you plan to go there with a bigger group
4
A rich-menu and tasty Halal food in Singapore... I don't think one would regret eating there, unless something extraordinarily wrong happens :-)
5
Came here for a take away dinner after a long day of shopping. We've been to hawker centers and indian restaurants in our 9 day Holiday amd sg and could not seem to find really good murtaback and roti. This was close to our airbnb rental and decided to try it.Good thing we did! Chicken murtabak was amazing! So was the roti and all for 13sgd!Had to wait 20mins though but the food was worth the wait.
1
This restaurant has become bad to worst. Came here for the second time. The first time was rather okay but this time is utter disgusting. Booked a table online because i thought it would be full on a weekend but surprisingly its only 30% full. When i walked-in, 2 staff saw me standing there and waiting to be served but sadly was ignored. I just grabbed a table and looked thru the menu. Once done, i waited to be served. One staff was busy setting up tables and chairs, another busy running back and forth, in and out the kitchen, another busy wiping a clean table. One manager saw me waiting but he ignored and cleaned a CLEAN table infront of me. A minute later, another staff cleaned the same table. Its almost 10 mins and i cant take this anymore so i started waving my hands up. One malay dude saw me but ignored AGAIN. Only when a chinese lady came out from the kitchen and saw me, she gave a signal to wait and SHE TOOK CLOTH AND TABLE SANITIZER TO CLEAN THE SAME TABLE INFRONT OF ME. Once she's done, she came to me mumbling that she's assigned to cashier but she's taking order cause her colleagues went missing. Took me 15 mins to be served! Good jobMy order came it fast. Food is always nice here, no doubt.Went to cashier to make payments. A malay staff that ignored me earlier was standing there. Im not sure if he did not feel my presence there or he just simply didnt bothered. The manager came in but did not take our bill. Only when the same chinese staff came in to assist us.The food there is nice but this kind of customer service is unacceptable. Giving the reputation of Spize restaurant, im very disappointe
4
We went as part of a wider group and the menu is big enough to cater for all tastes. The food was done well, without being exceptional, and the selection of drinks was great.The staff could be better in their attentiveness but all in all a great evening out
3
Following a recent renovation, the place is now much more comfy and prices haven't increased much, so it will continue to be popular, especially with youth and party goers. On week nights, Spize and the two chicken rice restaurants on this stretch of River Valley Road do decent business when new joints are struggling. The food is more interesting than good - like the Indian-spiced version of several Malay dishes
4
If you End up at spize after a Long night, I assure you the star burger will hit the spot! Big menu with lots of options. Perfect way to end the night
4
We booked our table through the online reservation at the website with confirmation by phone and email which, I thought, was a good follow up. The food was great with good service from the staff serving us. We'll definitely come back again.

On Sunday 28th February 2016 I booked via the internet for lunch for my wife, my daughter and I, at Spize Restaurant River Valley. I have been there on at least five previous occasions in the last year.On arrival the Restaurant was approximately 70% full on the inside with very little people seated on the sidewalk. We were shown to our table and handed menus. After some 8 to 10 minutes, having waited for someone to attend our table, we tried to draw the attention of the middle aged female waitress allocated to our table. Despite noticing our signal she simply ignored us and continued to clear tables and serve remaining tables without responding to us. She cleared at least two tables and seated new arrivals in our immediate vicinity without attending to our table.In the next 10 minutes we attempted five times to draw attention of waiters â€“ three times to the female waiter and twice to other male waiters who came into sight. We were simply ignored.After 20 minutes had elapsed I got up and walked over to the same female waitress who simply ignored us, and asked her when we would receive service. She commented in a rude manner that she was busy and she beckoned an male waiter, Ismael, to attend our table. Ismael apologised for the bad behaviour of the female waitress, and said they were very busy.By now my family and I were so upset that we decided to rather leave the restaurant than stay for lunch. I asked Ismael to call the floor manager in order that I may report the situation. Ismael replied that they did not have a manager in attendance and that I can lodge a complaint on the web page. I insisted that it was not good enough and I wanted to speak to the person in control.Ismael went over to an Indian gentleman at a station near our table and conversed with him. This man made a dismissive comment and hand signal which indicated to me that he was not in the least interested in talking to me. He ignored Ismaels request to speak to me, despite the fact that I was less than 5 meters from him.I then walked up to him and advised him that we had been in the restaurant, waiting for service, for some 25 minutes. He dismissed my statement as incredulous and asked me where we sat. I indicated that we were seated at a table, less than 3 meters from his station. He then shrugged. I insisted on having his name and he wrote it on a piece of paper. He chucked the paper on the station top and then turned his back on me and walked off without any apology or greeting.I have an image of the name he wrote - it appears to be Roy or Rory.My family and I have travelled the world and I regret to advise that the treatment we received from Spize River Valley staff ranks as the worst we have ever received from a restaurant. It is indicative of disgustingly poor guest service delivery and equally disgustingly poor management
1
My family was deeply disappointed by the lack of service and rude attitude of staff. Will not retur
5
Spize is a good place to find good food at reasonable prices (and large servings).It can get quite crowded sometimes, so be prepared to wait for a table.We recommend the Asian/rice dishes, especially the Nasi Goreng Ayam. We found that their servings are good for sharing
3
The restaurant is next to where I am staying. I never dine in and very often order take away online. But the place seems always very crowded. The food to me is very mediocre but reasonably priced. The waiting time for my orders is usually one hour and two hours on weekend evening dinner hours. Due to the online ordering service, I never once have to wait for my food. It is always ready when reach the restauarant. Owing to the convenience, I will definitely continue patronizing the restaurant. I am sure the waiting is hell for the sit in customers unless u want to sit and chat. My verdict are that all rice dishes and western food are okay but not the noodles dishes
4
We ordered roti john with chicken and cheese, mushroom and cheese prata, egg and cheese prata. A coconut and ice milo. Spize is still one of my favorite place for the roti john. It was a place i liked since the first time i went. However it seems that the staffs were abit shorthanded due to the crowd, which kind of affected the service
4
The fact that they are taking traditional indian prata shop food and putting it in a much more comfortable environment. Good food with a wide variety of options. Great place to bring tourists or foreigners and expose them to many different foods under the same roof
3
Went to Spize River Valley Feb9, together with companions after a 6-hour game (definitely tired and hungry). Surely, the food here is OK (we always go to this place). The servings are big and the price is modest. I personally love the drinks, thus I always go up-size. To conclude, this is one of our spots to go after each game. Our orders were taken. Though it took more time before the first food was served but understandably, there were many customers (so we are fine with it). 2 orders were missed (this is not the first time it happened to us). We kept on following up but only repeatedly informed that it is on its way. Food was served after almost an hour of waiting with everyone almost finished their meals already. Restaurant needs to improve on Food ordering mechanism to avoid missed orders despite the volume of customers. Missed orders should be given priority as well and shall not be queued in a regular fashion to avoid further delay. Tip on big groups going to Spize: if most of the orders were already served and 1 or 2 orders are missing, immediately call the Crew's attention and highlight the missing item. On a different note, a Filipino service crew was able to handle the situation well. Hats off
5
Great for a easy meal especially for groups. Wide selection of items on the menu to cater to the whole dining party's preferences. Good value and generous portions for hearty eaters
5
Great food especially roti john mutton and spize burger. Staff very helpful and friendly. Will recommend river valley branch.
3
Limited choice of main course other than asian kitchen menu where u ordered individual dishes.
Staff arent very friendly
5
My friend stay in Singapore. He recommended this place . Its like a local Dhabha . Good food. Loved the chicken biryani.
4
Great restaurant with a good vibe and really cheap food. Noodles, rice, seafood all great dishes, local choices and western choices. Recommended.
3
The food was reasonably (local dish and burger) good. But they have to work on the terms of cooking the steak/kebabs as per what the customer wants "Rare, medium-rare, well etc". The setting was good but the place was cramp and noisy.
4
We had our chinese new year party celebration a bit earlier at work and after that my husband and I stopped to grab a bite in Spize which was recomended by one of our colleagues, I liked everthing I tried, simply yummy good good at affordable prices
5
I love this place. We order quite a lot so I could not remember all. Roti John, Canai, Nasi Goreng and last but not the least Banana Split. It was da bomb! It's HUGE! yes it's GIGANTIC. I think you need at least 4 people sharing the food to finish everything.By the way, this restaurant open for almost 24 hours! Now you know where to go when hunger strikes in the middle of the night or after clubbing lo
4
This place has been renovated, and feels like a very chic restaurant, with nice music in the background playing ! The roti prata is pretty good and the prices are very reasonable. Only thing to note is that it is very crowded and food will take awhile to come, as I went at almost midnight, and the place is packed 
4
Our 1st time ordering a supper delivery from Spize. Delivery was earlier that estimated time, which was good. Food was delicious however the quantity of rice was little. It was more for a child to eat than adult. Apart from that, their mixed bbq grill was fresh. Good experience
2
Food was great. There are plenty to choose from. However, the service was bad. Despite the efforts of booking a table for 4, there were no one to greet us at the front desk. The waiters/waitress could not care less. Although the location ambience is good, i will not recommend it to others
4
Awesome! Great place to hang out with friends! Better reserve early as they are usually packed especially on Friday nights!
4
There are many food. I've tasted lasagna, grilled chicken burger, fried rice and a wrap. Of all, lasagna was my favourite for it tasted really good.
The ambience is comfortable for a nice gathering.
3
Wide range of selection of local dishes at affordable price. Location is not very good as there are no parking space. Halal certified. The unsized drinks are huge in portion. So are the food. Value for money.
5
Nice place, great food and good price!
Highly recommended. I went with my family and we had different choices. Not sure which one was the best dish.... all of them very good.
5
Great and Lovely Experience! Had an amazing farewell dinner with my colleagues before i fly off to aussie!
5
A frequent to this place. Would order their burger without fail, each time I'm here. The ambience is spacious, which is good for large crowds.
3
I am very confused with this place. I have been at Spize (river valley) several times and sometimes it is very good and another time it is not. We still keep going there as they are open till very late hours. I usually order kebab. However meat can be hard and dry or very good. So it is totally depends on the day. Their noodles are more stable, and I heard excellent comments about their crayfish dishes.
5
our taxi driver pointed this place out on way in form airport, so we tried it out and food was excellent. the fried rice omelet concoction, sorry forgot the real name was probaly one of our best dishes in Singapore. the mixed seafood grill option had amazing flavor. it is halal, so no alcohol, but big range of juices or other drink options filled the gap. thoroughly recommend it
5
A good place to go if you can't decide what kind if food you want or your group wants to eat different types of cuisine. Chose from Asian, Italian, Mediterranean, burgers etc. good service. Most seating outside - don't go for fine dining experience. Go for good food at a good price with plenty of choice.
4
Love the interior and how it severe both local and westernize food in a cafe. Staffs were friendly and food is great! Reservation will be recommended to avoid long wait. If you're looking for a Halah with a touch of cafe style, Spize is the great option!
5
I love it here, Nice place, nice food.
The staff is so friendly
Nothing to complain :) will be back for sure
4
good to have reunion with ex colleagues at spize, a lot of memory. we used to come here while we were doing nightshift, always satisfied with the food and moments we were together
4
The ambience is relaxed, and the food is always good. Coming here with friends after a hard day is a guaranteed way to unwind. Only problem now is the long queue so now it's best to make reservations in advance.
4
The staff were friendly and helpful. Love how the restaurant looks like now. Food is always great! (:
4
We were there, twice, during our 2 weeks stay.On Friday evening, it was pack, busy, we had to wait for 30 minutes. But, this is a good sign for a good food rite?We had everything, Chinese, Malay, Indian and Mediterranean. All good, specially the Indian.Price wise, not to expensive, very reasonable.We enjoyed the food, and we also experienced their delivery service. Very good, professionally packed, and.... arrived before their promises schedule.We are happy with Spize, but please do make reservations in advance...
5
If you are hungry, head down to this cheap and nice ambience and good food. However, usually it's really a long queue but fast. Food is cheap and good. The egg and onion prata is nice. The lychee drink is good also. Drinks are in large cups. Many variety of food from mee goreng to prata, to western food to noodles. A good place to hangout. There's indoor aircon or outdoor dinin
1
Terrible experience. Restaurant do not accept Chope reservation although we show the confirmation email. My oversea guests had to wait 45 min before a table. Food is so-so and overly salty.Will not visit again. Please remove this restaurant from your list.
1
We came to the place on time but they said that all tables were full despite me making my reservation. They pointed me to the call-center to sort out my reservation instead of helping me resolve it themselves
5
Use to eat out with friends. They have renovated and made dining a wonderful experience! Food are served quickly and promptly. It's not a five star restaurant but a high end hawker dining experience with class. We live the ambience and friendly service. We are impressed by their service and especially by Mr Ismael. He is very diligent and professional in providing a friendly service. I love their sheesh kebab. The lamb kebab is very tasty, fresh and juicy. The only complain is when the second time I ordered the sheesh kebab, the size of the meat were smaller. Other than that, it's excellent. Thumbs up

Came as a group of colleagues dining in for dinner. Seafood that we ordered tasted really good! The vegetarian option however, was lacking according to my colleague. Nearly renovated deco gives an excellent ambience to relax whilst enjoying the excellent dishes. Cost <30 per pax despite the many food we ordered
5
Spoilt for choices to choose from. Always back for more and will bring friends to try out at Spize.

Been here a dozen times and it's the first time we receive such great service by a fellow server by the name of Ismael. Thank you Ismael for the warm welcome and sincere service! :-)

Mutton soup was good but not great. RJ Special tasted good with sufficient of ingredients and Nasi goreng Ikan Masin was great!
4
chope is easy to use. but my name was somehow registered as 'Juanita' in the reservation so there was some confusion when we got there.
5
This particular cozy restaurant place in the heart of River Valley serve awesome value for money dishes. variety of food offered in the menu,but decided to have their steak cooked rare, tastiest ever with alongside their mushroom sauce. Friendliest staff ever named Ismail, gave me extra sauce for their steak as I was waiting for my Girlfriend food to arrive. A sure die die must try place. Halal als

One thing i love about Spize was that there is a queing area. They ensure its 1st come 1st serve basis. If only some of their staff are attentive enough and will approach us in the queue instead of just look and walk away. I made a reservation for 4 adults + 2 kids, however they made a mistake on their side by reserving 2 adults + 2 kids. One of the staff who attended to us was efficient as he could see that we were with a 2 year old kid, he quickly set us a table for 6 outdoor seating at first, let us order our food and when the next table was ready, he moved us indoors. Kudos to his service! Eventhough the place was crowded, we didnt need to wait that long for our food to be serve and it still turn out great

We went here from the recommendation from our friend. Unfortunaly, this restaurant is very disappointed. I'll never recommend this to anyone. We have to wait for one of our food for an ages. Two of us have tried to eat very slow and after we finished the food, my husband burger hasnt come yet. We need to ask many times to them. Not sure what happening as no explanation and apologise at all. And his burger meat was still raw. Unbelievable!!! After we wait for ages then our food is still raw!! We complain to one of the staff and he said so what do you want us to do? Wowwww...... It was my first time a staff in a restaurant said this after what happened. And yes we still paid full amount for all of the food including the uncooked burger & of course no apologis
5
I like the food served here especially the "penang char kway teow" and prata which come with a superb curry.Love the flavour and spiciness :-)this place is always full with long queue (tips: better make a reservation beforehand to grab yourself a table)Good ambience for hanging around with pals.Special thanks for Ismael for his friendly and hostile serviceDouble thumbs up!!

This restaurant was suggested by a friend of mine who's living in Singapore, some years ago. At first glance, this place didn't interest me at all. I ordered the roti john mutton, and my friend ordered a cheese prata, and to be honest, DAMN it's very good! From that point, I suggested every person that'll go to Singapore to eat in that place. But be patient, with their new extended place, more people coming, and you must wait in the line to be seated (last time, I waited for 1 hour)
5
Went there twice - first thinking it to be an Indian food restaurant. Enjoyed the pratas and chicken curries. Having had a good experience we went again to taste local Singaporean food. Enjoyed a mee goreng, roti John as well as the pratas. Overall a good experience
5
Fast service, good food, attentive staff. all in all, keep it up! i like the online reservation system. it's really helpful.
4
Been here frequently for night takeouts. Nice spread of dishes variety. Abit pricey though but portions and flavor is nice.
5
Good Place with great food and ambience!! Highly recommended to everyone for a group gathering!!! =)
4
The restaurant’s interior is decent. We liked the high ceiling. We loved all our orders: Cereal Prawns, Lemon Chicken and Pork choices and the rice. Not accepting credit cards at the time we visited.
Recommending this place.
4
If you feel like filling your stomach with those junky, strong tase food... I recommend this place! I had a hamburger, which is huge enough to fill up my hungry stomach. Strong garic taste is good for first bite, but to be honest I got a bit tired of it at last... but those kind of taste make you wanna re-visit once in a while
5
Another hidden place to snack. The place is now renovated and able to contain more patrons. Anyway the food that I recommend is the prata with egg, an awesome snack that is so good. Then the roti john which is so large that you cannot finish it sometimes. Overall this place offers a very generous food portion at a very affordable price without sacrificing any quality. Highly recommended!!
4
Heard a lot about this place from friends and I know the owner as well. Finally got the chance to dine here last night with colleagues, after a lomg night of work. The food we ordered were roast lamb wrap, steak, seafood aglio olio and beef stir fry with vegetables. The food was excellent! Loved the presentation and the service. The seafood aglio olio was one of the yummiest and spiciest that I have ever eaten. Yums!
4
Spize was a 10min walk from our apartment so it was an easy option for lunch or dinner, we went a couple of times... The menu has so many options to choose from and usually I would say this spells trouble for restaurants trying to do to many things and not do them well. We mainly stayed with noodle/rice dishes and the roti breads which were soooo delicious, so I can't really comment on the many many other menu items. The service was a little bit slow as we went during busy times but nothing that I would really complain about
4
Spize is a River Valley institution - nowadays the best way to eat here is either to get it delivered, order for takeaway or make a reservation. The food is amazing and ambience makes it so great to bond with friends there, which explains the queue for tables every night
2
Went to simpang bedok when the newly renovated shop opened for a family meal 2 nights ago. Ordered chicken chop but it is not cooked in the inside and in the end have to order prata for extra food. Prata still taste as good but was disappointed on the wastage of the chicken chop. The drinks I ordered a root beer and the ice cream taste really bad. Taste like butter to me instead of ice cream. Will not return anymore because was a bad experience as a whole. Probably was expecting too much for a newly renovated place as it looks so much more classy from previous. There again, i prefer the old place because the food and drinks were so much better. Whats the point of a nice environment but lousy food
4
So many food items to choose that makes you spoilt for choice. Good atmosphere for gatherings. Waiters have to be more attentive.
3
The restarant offers a wide selction of food. Quality is ok bit nothing really great.
No alcojolmos served.
5
Visited Spize with the family whilst staying at Fraser Suites. Great food, service and value for money. Meals are quick, tasty and large. Recommend a visit.
3
Swee la that Filipino guy who attended my table and reservation. Professional and very socialising..
5
Easy to reserve via chope
Highly recommendation. Food okok not my acceptable. Service very good :-).
5
Terrific food! Remarkable prices! I need a wheelbarrow out after each visit.. and its damn worth it!
4
Service was relatively ok but there sure is more room for improvement. More attention is required to ensure customers are not waiting n waving to get the attention of the staff to place orders or request for something. Ambience is good and we njoyed our food. Penang Char Kway Teow is worth trying and Roti John is one not to be missed.. :
5
A good friend took us to this place. When we arrived the place was full. We had to wait for a while to be seated, but the wait is worth it. We ordered their spicy stingray! oh and this LMAO juice was absolutely refreshing. I will definitely come back to this place on my next trip to Singapore
3
Had a bit of a wait but wasn't too worried as the place seemed to be popular with locals. Mix of Asian and Mediterranean food. Good service and food alright but nowhere near as good as hawkers on Zion Road. Would have liked the option of a beer
3
Many said this is the place to eat, but I find it not good. The huge banana icecream roll was not that good. Me and my friends ordered the chicken steak, BBQ and the burger and it's just of average taste. I feel this restaurant is overated. They said follow the line, but I say , pass by this one. Slow order taking, slow food service and very slow billing, the waiter didnt inform us that we have to be the one to go to the cashier to pay, as most restaurant do in SG
4
Good Halal restaurant, fresh food good service .Modern clean and busy place .Popular with young locals. Food was hot and tasty. Prices were reasonable . Fresh Juices were excellent
4
Good food and decent ambience after renovation. Suitable outlet for both family and friends. Its really a retreat away from the hustle and bustle of orchard
4
Good for function and chill. The environment is contemporary concept wit modern music played it really makes tired mind relax and really enjoy the delicious food.
The food is excellent we family love it so much.
5
Been a fan of Spize for many years now, but dined exclusively at the Bedok outlet. Was surprised to find an online reservation option for the River Valley, so decided to try it out with my wife and 5 other friends. Was impressed by the confirmation call for the reservation on the day of dining and food and service was up to standard with reasonable pricing
4
The meals were not that bad however can be improve. I love the Prawn Penne Pasta with Chilli Cream Sauce it was devine!!! :D Service crew needs to be a little bit more friendly. Other than that it was a very good experience i had, very nice ambience and theme. Thank you Spize River Valley... I will for sure to drop by again to try the other foods there :

Really disappointed with the service. Once, we ordered some food for takeaway from the River Valley outlet at 11pm and were told to wait for 40 minutes. We complied cause we were craving for their food. So we checked with them after 40 minutes but were told to wait a little while more, but in the end they took an extra 40 minutes. Expected more from them since they've been around for years. On a separate occasion, I dined in at the same outlet. Relatively empty restaurant on a weekday afternoon. So I thought their service would be better. All was well until we decided to call the staff to help us pack our excess food for take away. This Filipino waitress came over, annoyed cause we interrupted her conversation with another staff. She then gave this slight jerk in the head to signal to us "What do u want?" Yes, she did not ask us nicely if we needed anything. When we told her to pack the fries and the roti john, she gave an annoyed look and asked, "Huh? Both?" Then she extended her hand to wait for us to pass the plates to her. I don't mind helping, but for her to just extend her hand to WAIT for us to pass them to her, I thought it was pretty rude. The staff definitely need to be educated on how to talk to the customers.Won't rave about this restaurant to my friends for sure. Only saving grace is the pretty good food
3
We called ahead for a delivery and after getting our details were told the waiting time was 2 and 1/2 hours. Whoever waits that long for food. So we decided to visit the Bedok restaurant. The waiter was distinctly arrogant and had attitude to match a rockstar. A simple question if they served beer was answered with arrogance about them being a halal place. That I understand but not the attitude. And when I asked the man to speak nicer he almost started shouting. And during the meal, it was clear he brushed past me with added roughness as he went to serve other guests. All in all terrible service, the folks need to be told how to talk to customers. Food wasn't bad and that was clearly the saving grace
1
Made a delivery order online at 1am to spize river valley. Said the waiting time is 2 hours however by 3am delivery still not made. When called customer service, was told that they overlooked the order. All they did was said sorry and asked me "so how now?" Wow. Im amazed by the service. Please kindly do not order from them coz u wun know whether ur food will arrive or not
3
My family and I visited Spize restaurant on Sunday 24th.The atmosphere and ambiance was very inviting (for casual dining) and the food was amazing. The quality, taste and presentation was fabulous, however the service was a major disappointment.All the food that we ordered came out at different times. My husband and son had already finished their meals when mine arrived. I was half way through my meal when my daughters arrived. It made the whole meal very uncomfortable and not enjoyable. The drinks we ordered, came reasonably quick, however my daughters drink which was the same as everyone else's (fruit juice but different flavor) came 40 mins after we ordered and after she had finished her meal. Regarding the drink, we had to ask another 2 times for it. Extremely disappointing. Lastly, part of our meal we ordered, was Satay, which arrived after 40 mins and after we had all eventually eaten and were ready to leave.The service and delivery of food/drinks etc is a serious major let down. The food however was definetly worth a visit
1
Spize has been a favourite of ours since 2003 when we first moved to this area. Even after leaving singapore every business trip would see me here for atleast one visit. And since moving back we are regulars. But today was sad. The place was full of moths attracted to the new lighting after the renovation. Moths flying around, landing on my arm and legs and then worst of all suddenly found in my glass of juice or one my rice plate. And we were sitting way insideIts ok. This is no michelin star place but when the lead servers (seemed part owner) respond to my mentioning there being a lot of both at the END OF MY WHOLE VISIT (after bearing it all without complaine) that "we can't do anything about it " and that too with a tone of severe arrogance, that is the last straw. They are so used to people coming and so used to doing well that seems now they can't be bothered that they have an insect problem all over the inside of the restaurant. Hopefully they do something but the attitude of the lead persons on the ground is not going to being me back anymore. Ten year regular says adie
1
1st: the food come before the drinks (it is still ok with me)2nd: I waited my spoon and fork for 10 MINUTES!!I waved my hands, none of the floor stuff respond to us!!3rd : I went to their counter I asked where is my spoon and fork? 1 of the stupid indian asked me don't shout! Im so angry and disappointed!!Good food but stupid service!
2
So we got to Spize and went to the entrance with the queue line. There was no one in the queue but we waited at the sign for someone to show us to a table. A waiter chatted directly in front of us and looked at us but decided not even to acknowledge our presence. He then walked away leaving us there - so we went in and found ourselves a table. Following this we were given the menu etc. and i decided to have the shish kebab and my partner the nasi lemak - we were told this would be 20 to 30 minutes - ok, they were busy, that's fine. About 15 min later the Shish Kebab arrived (which looked great from the picture). Now, i realise pictures in the menu are for reference only, but what was placed in front of my was very disappointing. 3 small pieces of chicken with a few small pieces of green & red peppers in between not nearly filling up the skewer. Now if this was SGD $10 it might not have been so bad, but this cost just under SGD $18! I talked to a guy who said he was the manager and while he was generally polite he had nothing much to say. He thought 18$ was a great price for the measly pieces of meat i got. My partner had the nasi lemak which she said was nice, but nothing special. The nasi lemak arrived about 15 minutes after the shish kebab, so I had already finished this by the time it arrived - obvioulsy not a great experience watching your partner eat while waiting for your meal.Anyway, despite the pretty bad service and measly portions, the food was good so i might give this place another shot (but definitely not the Shish kebab). This is Singapore, so service expectations are never high, but would it be really that difficult to have waiters who don't ignore customers and are polite

How i wish i could upload a picture. This is the 1st time im writing in under spize. We order 30 sticks of satay with ketupat at a dollar fifty cents. (The satay cost a dollar each sticks aniway). Wen we received the satays is hot. Deliciously nice. But the ketupat was like a cold stone. My friend wanred to eat n poke at it. We could see how hard it is. We told 1 of your staff by the name of VIMAL, he took it and went to the kitchen. So im assuming he's changing the new one for us. Infact he came back with the same ketupat. He said that he has heated it up for us. Please. The more u heat it up. The more harder the ketupat is. Atleast learn a lil ting or two about ketupat. I dont wanna debate more and just took the hard ketupat. He came back with a new ketupat explaining on the same method of heating up for the rest of the ketupat. Wat a joke. I dont mind paying but not for this kind of food being served and this kind of customer service. VIMAL went on telling his colleagues. All of them are looking at our table. Some are smirking. Some are laughing. Well. This is bad service. Totally BAD SERVICE!!

My husband and I were recommended to eat here after a night out. The food was just fantastic and hit the spot! They are open till late and have a very unique menu. We had the biryani and almost went back a second day! ( if you need a place with good food - good prices for Singapore - you can't go wrong with Spize)

Went to spize river valley on the 15/3/2015, around 9:30pm.. Ordered one Roti John and Maggie Goreng Pattaya. The staff told us that the food might need to wait around 30mins due to the crowd which we can totally understand..and having waited around 20mins the food finally arrived.. The Roti John came but they gave Nasi Goreng Pattaya instead.. Told the service staff that they gave us the wrong dish and requested them to change to the correct one.. Service staff was kind enough to change it and he told us to wait as they will cook the correct dish.. (Time to cook the dish we assume..)We waited for another 20mins but the maggie goreng pattaya still not arrive.. Seeing alot of food coming out from the kitchen but not our food.. We were very angry and disappointed with the service because the kitchen should have prepare this food immediately to replace the wrong one previously.. not let us wait another 20mins for the food.. The service staff only keep telling us that the food is on its way,, but it was not.. In the end we couldn't wait anymore so we went to cashier to cancel this food and checkout the bill .. and at this time, this same service staff then actually told the kitchen to cancel cooking the maggie goreng.. so actually for the past 20mins this food was never being prepared at all!Spize's food are generally quite nice overall.. no doubt about this.. but with this kind of service.. i'm not sure now if i will gonna visit here again.. Very disappointed with the service!

On 15/03/2015 at 1751hrs i called bedok outlet for take away order(Order No 0360 Check #1934532). I was informed to collect the food at 1815hrs. I reached the outlet and paid for my order at 1815hrs. When I went to collect my food after making the payment, I was informed that only my Roti John was ready. My Nasi Ayam Grande and Stingray was not yet ready. After waiting another 10mins, my Nasi Ayam finally came. I waited till 1830hrs, and my stingray was still not ready. I asked the manager why isn't my stingray ready and his explanation was it takes 30mins to cook (are you kidding me??). So based on his calculation, even if the kitchen start making my order at 1800hrs, the stingray should be ready by 1830hrs. I waited till 1845hrs and it was still not ready. Why did the outlet state 1815hrs, if my order is going to be delayed? Is my parking free? What is the purpose for me to call the outlet and order in advance. Might as well I come to the outlet, order and then wait. While I was standing there since 1815hrs to 1845hrs, I noticed that all the other orders after me was prepared and served. Even the take aways. This is not the first time I have experienced this. This is the worst service and the inefficiency of the kitchen staff had wasted my dinner time and money. By the way,the kitchen staff was very rude. I heard him tell the manager when he asked about my order," Ask the person just wait la." He think I did not hear it. But hello! I am waiting for 30mins since the said time. I only received my order at 1845hr. 30 mins from the time THE OUTLET said the order will be ready
1
Three meals - one pretty good, one bad (had to be sent back) and the third took the Ugly category.Tie this in with the normal inept and still surprisingly incompetent service and this was not a pleasant experience.Oh well at least some alcohol helped - oh sorry they dont serve alcohol. So we had some soft drinks - in addition my wife asked for a glass of tap water for which they charged 60 cents. First time in my life I have ever seen that happen.Wont be back..... ever
1
Unfortunately its CNY and most of the other eateries are closed, it brought us here to order some food. A malay gentleman in white shirt whom i believed to be the in-charge is simply incompetent. Impatient, not polite, has no customer service. Probably because of the overwhelming order they are having as he repeatedly reminding us how busy they are. He should probably review his role as an in-charge. Knows how to manage a team well be it how pressuring the situation may seem
4
Come hungry and bring your appetite, it will be fulfilled. Lots of choices of local fares, Chinese, Indian, Malay & Western dishes. Desserts too. Not a good place if you're on diet, you're screwed here. Over the years we've tried almost all items in the menu but here are some faves: nasi goreng ikan masin, all kinds of prata, seafood soup with salted veggies, air limau, ikan tiga rasa. Broccoli with prawns in oyster sauce. We did not like the toman fish fillet with ginger & spring onion coz it was breaded. Fast, friendly service. Ask waiter for recommendations. Street side dining for authentically local vibes. This place has young and vibrant energy. We liked it. We also appreciate that it opens til late for when you're craving some familiar taste near midnight or after midnight and everything else is closed
1
Food Delivery was done on time however the food was very bad and very salty.The only good thing is the sweet and sour fried chicken and the roti john.every other item was so salty.Definitely would not order again from Spiz
5
Too tired from all that shopping? Hungover? Try delivery from this place ! Quite a menu too. Call center was very helpful. Order arrived really fast and nicely packed. My Nasi Lemak was good!
4
The variety of food on offer ensures that no matter how big your group is, everyone can order what they like.
5
This place is always full and bustling with people, especially between 10pm and 3am . nice spread , decent service . economical
4
they have mosts of the good selection available. is it very fatty to have heavy supper but once awhile doesn't matter haha! great Prata, iced drinks, roti john :)
4
If you're asian, there's a high likelyhood that you are looking for food in the wee hours of the morning. This is the place to be if you're looking for food. Freshly cooked food all the way until 4 or 5am.,
4
Spize is open more or less all night and serves great food to avoid hangovers the next day. Very reasonably prized and tasty when it comes to local fast food. Try the Murtabak or the Roti John. No alcohol is served but the drinks are very nice and big in size.Not a good place to lose weigh
4
This place is always full with young people, especially between 10pm and 3am. For where else can you find such a variety of food (Indian, Malay, 'Asian', western) at such super-low prices at wee hours? Service is friendly. Never mind that the food or not 'best in class'! Btw, they serve two versions of mee goreng (Malay and Indian) - the Indian version is pretty interesting, a bit like the 'Indian-Chinese' dishes you find in India
3
Its cheap and cheerful. Good food at ridiculously low prices!I have tried their chicken and cheese murtabak, mutton murtabak, chicken biryani (warning on the spice level!), roti, and the dessert with crispy crepe, bananas and ice cream.I've never tried their western food though -- I will probably go to a western restaurant if I want western food.Its usually full so expect to wait to be seated.Service is average -- and orders can slip when they are full. Manage expectations -- don't expect 5-star service if you are paying less than $10 per dish
1
Food is great as there are a lot of selections and they open late. Service, however, people there don't seem to give a crap. Ordered online, came to pick up cashier said order not ready. Waited for nearly half hour. When I checked for the second time, cashier said the food just came out and grab the bag of food beside him. The bag has been there since I came. Got the Food and it was cold. Very disappointin
4
I've been to Spize twice for dinner.Both time i went there was heavy crowd.Even though there's heavy crowd, the service was pretty fast. We were served by the waiters / waitress and our food was served within 15 mins for our first visit and 20 mins for our second visit.Not only fast , food were nice and serving was large
3
Nasi goreng seafood is good
Char kway teow excellent
Roti john chicken great
Price is moderate
But seating is crampy
Wish they had wider tables
We were 4 but seated more like two tables
4
Great food. Char kwey tiaw, nasi lemak, roti john chicken special, nasi goreng kampoeng and nasi goreng seafood was cooked deliciously cooked. Speed of delivery was good. Waitressess was kind. Came in a group of four. Will definitely return again...
4
Food was okay and delicious I ordered a burger, the only problem is the buns are cold. I dunno if they really serve it like that not warming up the bread. But over all food was superb!
4
Our plane arrived in Sing at 1:30 am and after way too many hours of airplane food, it was nice to be able to grab a tasty bite at such an hour. This place is a bit of a local hang out and you can see why. The food options are vast and it was fun to order different stuff and "share share". They also have wonderful juices and fresh coconut water. The table favorite was Watermelon and Pineapple lime. The Maggie goreng was quite a hit and I had a chicken wrap that was really good. We also shared some soups that were very good, but just a note if you are American, they don't clean the broth, so watch what you eat, as some things are in there only for flavor, and not to eat
4
Spize open at 6pm till early morning. it is a good place to hangout after night life. During my stay at Gallery Hotel for nearly 3 months, this is my main source of food supply. They can deliver or pick-up. i like it because i don't have to wait. they deliver to hotel for sahur!
2
My last visit to spize was not so memorable ! The food is above average but no reason to crib..but the service quality is poor!! Even a 2 item order can take 30 min ! Definitely not a place I would recommend if u are in a rush or have better things to do. Hope they realise that good service would go a long way in building a strong n loyal customer base. And please come up with a more effective ordering system. If u can't then make it self service with an alarm/alert system. There is no excuse for bad service! Hope this does not happen to others who want to enjoy a good meal..my last experience was a 4/10
5
There is nothing to say about Spize, except that they have a great food. Nasi goreng ayam is my favourite there. Just thinking about it making me drools all over the place and I'll always find the time to come to Spize whenever im in Singapor
5
No matter how many times i go back to Singapore, Spize is my toplist hawker food or resto that i must visit... This island is a home for me also with the culture and the foods that blend together in my blood. My favorite is Nasi Goreng Kampong, Roti John Special and Milo Dinosaur. Now they are island-wide delivery which is so cool for them who lives far away from River Valley area! Will go back to this place soon and take a pics the foods and the place. This place is LEGEND!!Must try!!! No other place like spize even the menu is similar! Trust me!! Today, i went to Upp Thompson Rd and got me a chicken chop minced meat noodles made by Ming Fa Fishball and ended my day with a dessert of an ice cream from Salted Caramel Artisan Ice Cream. My pick was Cookies and Cream, Milo Brunch and blabla tim tam. I can't find them on TripAdvisor (correct me if i'm wrong) so maybe someone or the owner can put their resto/cafe so i can give em the rating and pics of their foods! Thank yo
4
food was delicious, they have quite wide range of menu with lots of choices. i especially love the prata and murtabak. for fresh drink try their refreshing ice tea limau. good for late night munchies; they also offer delivery with additional service price. i once ordered prata at midnight and save it for breakfast and still tasted good. the portion is big enough for sharing with friends (especially for girls)
4
Had to try their milk tea and it was sooo good. They also have this crepe like dessert which is freshly made on a naan like bread. They were out of banana so we just ordered the one with choco.I will go back to check the rest of the menu out since they got tons of offereings. Looks interesting enough to eat.This place has acutal paper napkins, Just ask
5
I love the pratas sauce they do in spize and the spicy rice is amazing and ofcourse for a refreshment you should totally try their ice tea.. Is heaven
5
All of us enjoyed the food. They deliver to Fraser suites at all hours. Very close to fraser. Quick delivery.
4
Me and my friends showed up at Spize at 2am. We were afraid that the place was going to be shut but, it was bustling with people. The eatery was surprisingly clean. Their is a great selection of food on the menu, including singaporean, malaysian and continental dishes. The service was prompt. However, occasionally you might need to wait for a while to get a table. I ordered a Nasi Goreng Ayam Sambal, which is malaysian delicacy of fragrant rice and chicken. The food was hot and tasted fresh. I would highly recommend this, specially to those who love spicy food
2
Went with a friend for supper as it is convenient to my place. The servers were quite average in giving customer service. Waited about ten minutes for my nasi goreng ayam kunyit. Looks really yummy but something was not right about the rice. I ate the rice only to find out that, part of the rice had gone bad. Inform one of the server, Ifah. But I was told by her, why didn't i tell in the beginning. No apology was given and when I asked for the bill, they had actually charge me for it as well. Spoke to one of the senior waiters and the charge was omitted.
5
Showed up at 2am and the place was still bustling with people. Eatery was clean and service was prompt. Great selection of different food on the menu. Ordered roti prata (onion and cheese and egg) and murtabak (chicken). Server gave us an option of three different curries to match (chicken, fish, and vegie). Food showed up fast and hot, tasted fresh. Highly recommend
4
When here by chance,wanted to eat Martabak the Malay equivalent to the Indian stuffed paratha. It was late and the taxi driver suggested this restaraunt. Amazing Malay Indian fusion. Try the Martabak any variant and a must eat for Indians is the rice dish with prawn curry called Nasi Lemak Udon Sambal..All the food is tasty. A must visit for Indians IT types
3
Extensive menu and all done speedily well. Tasty food, I ask myself, how do they achieve to produce flavour-full dishes that satisfy. The place is hot with heavy traffic at midnight and no air-conditioning. Very much part of the local culture, Singapore equivalent of the US diner. Rough kitchen and id

This is an iconic budget place to eat, but because if their success they really don't seem to care if a customer has a bad experience with their food. My father ordered steak and I ordered cray fish. The steak came quickly and was excellent, the crayfish came 15 mins later along with the drinks we initially ordered. I ate much of the crayfish before I can across one that I had to spit out because it was clearly badly off. I called a waiter over and explained. The waiter disappeared and then another more senior came and asked what was the problem, I explained again and suggested she smelt the plate. She did and pulled her head away quickly and then just walked off with the plate without comment. Later when I asked for the bill I was surprised to find that they were asking me to pay the whole cost of the crayfish. I explained to the waiter that that couldn't be the case as one of the crayfish was off. Another waiter was sent over and he said I should have complained at the start. I said that the dish was in a heavy gravy sauce how was I to know it was off until I ate it. I said as a compromise why didn't they take 50% of the cost off. Instead they deducted $4 off for one crayfish. And not one word of apology. I live just around the corner from the restaurant, I will never return

This is a good place if you want a quick dinner and can't decide on what you want. it has india, asian and western. we were rather dubious about this but the murtabak was ok and was the hokkein seafood. wouldn't rave about it but it was o

Awesome food, awesome price, awesome quality!! This is one place where you can practically find food fusion - Thai, Chinese, Malay, Indian, Western. I've been here several times and was never disappointed with each visit. Seafood was all cooked superb and portions were generous! Tried their clams, crayfish, prawns, steak, Prata (of course), nasi goreng (fried rice), well...the list will keep on going. Anyhow, you people have got to get down to this mouth watering place!

The service was ok, quick, but the waitress had a certain chip on her shoulder. The Asia portion of our meal was outstanding, very delicious. We were disappointed with our India cuisine though. Overall good experience and we would return.

Indonesian, thai and local dishes. very nicely priced, excellent flavour, great atmosphere. Service is fast and efficient. Make sure you try the satay as the peanut sauce is excellent

The food is not bad....but the serving food so slow....I order the chicken briyani but was waiting more then half hour.....I wont come back to this place anymore!!!!!!!!!!!

They have really good spicy foods, mostly with Nasi Goring. They have a variety of Prata (the Cheese and Banana w/cheese) are a must-try! The curry is just cooked to my taste, not too spicy and there's no after taste. The place is situated right just very near to a bus stop near the heart of Orchard. They open late at night and closes in the morning. Just right for a late supper catch-up with friends and an early breakfast after clubbing! Serves food and drinks at a very reasonable price.Price range of meals starts at $5.0

Here you can find a big variety of Asian food. Its a non air-condition eating place and closes late, about 4am? They open around late afternoon. Just a few bustops away from orchard road.You should try the roti John, nasi goreng ayam kunyit or clay pot Tom yam. They have always been a favorite dish! Prices are cheap- if you were to compare with restaurant. They are very fast n prompt in serving the food to

If you want a good qaulity of food for a cheap price, then go there. This is not a restaurant, You sit by the side of the road, which I am ok with as a change!You can book your meal by phone or through their website and collect it later

Great local place for late-at- night suppers. The food is worth the price and there are a lot of varieties . It's a bit difficult to find the seat cuz the place is always crowded. The open-air environment is nice. Recommended to go after clubbing cuz it's open until 6 am.

It was an attractive option as it opens until late - or rather the next morning- and also it offers different variety of food - Malay, Thai, Indian,etc. So it's good as to satisfy if we have different cravings for the food.I personally like the outdoor seating, by the road. I find it a good spot to hang out and chit chat with friends. The food is average. From the dishes that we order, we like the ayam kuning, the prata and chicken curry. The penang char kway teow was tasteless. The nasi goreng kampung is not something special. However, must say that the serving size is big. A good point for one who has the size on top of their preferences.About the service, we feel that the staffs do not communicate well. They give rather short answer, and are not friendly

used to be my fav place ever since I was a teenager. their tom yum soup was great, so their roti john. but too bad their nasi goreng kampung isnt good like last time.
5

Great atomesphere but I wasnt impressed with food to the point I wouldn't go back. I'd prefer to pay more and get better quality.

Wonderful selections of local favourites.
Best late night dinning/supper place in the city.
Must try: Seafood tonyam and beef kai lan with steamed rice

Surprising improvement in quality of food and service. Serves a wide variety of dishes at affordable prices. Slightly expensive for the mamak stall environment, even if it's cafe-type, but the portions are very generous and the taste doesn't disappoint. Excellent for supper.

Always got difficulty to find a seat after mid-nite. But still this's 1 of my favorite supper place. Everytime wl over order.

late night munchies, pretty good food usually

best for supper after clubbing, or just for chill with frenz. Spize has lots varieties of food from malay food, thai food, indian food and chinese food. My favorite is nasi goreng ayam with ice te peng or lime juice. YUMMY=p
5
I LOVE IT!!!! YUmm YUmm...

The best Lime Juice ever, and all the food is good. Huge selection with a nice variety. If you can't find something here, you are too drunk. Been there a miliion times throughout 2009-2010. Make sure you have cash!!! No Debit cards accepted all you Americans out there. My least favorite dish of all was the Kung Pao Chicken, like everything else

this is LSCO favourite supper place

Ring of FIre!

Food's not that awesome, though the chicken cheese murtabak is a 3.5 4 stars...it's a perfect late night supper, after clubbing spot.
5
great food, cheap prizes, al fresco dining (literally beside the street!)... not fine dining but good comfort food. love the Mama Mia Murtabak.
3
great prata, iced limau and savoury kambing soup... there's hardly any supper as fulfilling.
3
Prata for supper after clubbing at Zouk, anyone? With it's ever-growing popularity, this place is still consistent with its great service and yummy prata.
4
Nobody can do a beehoon goreng ikan billis like Spize does
3
For Supper ..alot of variety of food

The branch at Simpang Bedok serves better food than the River Valley one. Must trys are the chicken fajitas, chocolate prata, and the chicken and cheese roti john.

This outlet opens till late with a bunch of hard working waitresses manning the usually packed tables. The food is really below mediocre but I think it's a good place to hang out for a meal or two late night when most other places are closed
