We used to the behoon crab and shark fin soup here so we ordered something different to accompany the soup, the abalone rice. It’s rice with brown sauce and abalone plus mushroom and a bit of crab meat. Simply delicious !!

Highly recommend this restaurant brand for Sharkfins soup lover. The taste is so authentic , always deliver constant quality. Also combining with the Carlsberg Beer Pork Ribs & asparagus as a main course will complete your dine in Thai Village

Food was ok, service slow, even for a nearly empty restaurant. Lots of sauces and gravy's as typical Teochew style. Pepper venison, fried fish and sweet/sour pork the best of choices. Off the beaten path at the Indoor stadium. Not bad, but not great.Booked a team lunch and surprised that our expected Thai meal had no Thai food on the menu! This is a straight Chinese/Teochew cuisine menu. There were a couple of token items with the word Thai in them, but certainly not. Even the green mango salad had pork floss on top

We visited this restaurant for the first time. We came on a weekday for lunch. Limited lots are available in an open air carpark L. Otherwise park at Leisure Park, which is the closest, or at Indoor Stadium for covered parking. As mentioned by Tripadvisors, this place is to be avoided if there are concerts or performances at the Indoor Stadium or Sports Hub.We came especially for the baked crab, their house specialty. We avoided the other specialty as it is sharkfin soup (save the sharks). The vermicelli tasted only of the soya sauce but not of crabs...So it was indeed not worthy. So was the other dish, braised sea cucumber..

Located just beside the indoor stadium. Can get there by mrt (stadium) or by public transport - taxi. Famous for its shark fin soup. Waitress and waitresses are very friendly. A great place for a family gathering or celebration for a special occasion. Try to avoid when there's any event or concert as there will be a lot of traffic around that area

My son gave us a dinner treat tonight (5 May 2016) at Thai Village Restaurant at its Stadium Walk Branch. We ordered Thai style chilli crab, baked crab with vermicelli, fried deer meat with spring onion, baby kai lan fried with garlic, drunken prawn and braised sharkfin. The sharkfin is of superior quality and all of us loved this dish. Both the two crab dishes are very fresh. Price is reasonable and is value for money with a 25% discount given by the restaurant in celebration of its 25th anniversary. For a party of 5, we paid only about $250+ after discount. It is indeed a good deal! The 25% discount is on until 30 June 2016.Service is exemplary. Service staff always ensure that tea cups are full during our entire dinner at the restaurant. Keep up the good service!This restaurant is highly recommended for superior sharkfin and fresh crabs

In the morning of 11 October 2015, my wife was asking me about an ideal eatery where we could have our lunch that day. All the more important consideration was a restaurant serving braised superior shark fin soup. Without much hesitation, we decided to head for Thai Village Restaurant at Singapore Indoor Stadium. It is one of their three restaurant outlets renowned for exquisite Thai-Teochew cuisine in Singapore for the last two decades since 1991.From the food menu, we selected two small clay pots of Thai Village’s signature shark fin soup with crab meat (S$65 each), one mini clay pot of popular baked crab vermicelli (S$36), one pot of Chinese tea (S$2) and two Thai coconuts (S$6 each). With just two of us, we could not be going for more though all our orders were in small portions.While waiting for our main courses, we were served with tasty braised peanuts and tangy achar nonya spicy pickled salad. The hot tea paired well with these cold appetizers.Thai Village’s shark fin with crab meat is a pricey delicacy among fans who love its rich savory broth and finest caudal fins. Its slippery and glutinous texture created a thickened bisque so delectable. This superb dish was scrumptious with a little vinegar, bean sprouts and coriander leaves for additional flavor enhancement. The fresh and meaty crab together with soft-crunchy Chinese mushrooms in the soup was toothsome and flavorful. We really enjoyed this luscious premium gumbo served steaming hot in the clay pots.Baked crab with vermicelli is another Thai Village’s specialty. This dish was perfectly cooked with the ambrosial braising sauce and garnished with garlic seeds and cilantro to bring out the beautiful aroma and sweetness of the Sri Lanka crab and the springy vermicelli. The soft vermicelli had absorbed all the flavorful essence of the crab, making it very delicious and fragrant. When it was eaten with the finely minced green chili paste, the bites were palatable. It really propelled us to another addictive dimension! We finished our meal with a Thai coconut each, a really chilled, sweet and refreshing fruit drink to end our savory meal. The total cost inclusive of service charge and GST was S$214.65. Service quality was above average and the dining environment was clean and in fine Oriental decoration but the ambiance was brightly lit, comfortable and elegant. Their food prices might understandably be a tad on the higher end but relatively reasonable for their good food quality and premium ingredients. We will certainly go back for the impeccable quality cuisine. No wonder some food lovers say that Thai Village Restaurant is a paradise for braised shark fin soup and baked crab vermicelli
