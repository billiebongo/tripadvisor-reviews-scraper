at $16 nett for the chirashidon, its pretty reasonable pricing for the CBD. portions are quite filling too.

They are very generous with their sashimi portions in their barachirashi dons here, though the quality of the fish could be fresher.

quick business lunch. portion is quite big, flavours are good. servers are attentive. value for money

The idea of choosing your ingredients made me visit every week. Price is expensive as the don is so small. But the quality wise, its the nicest among all don ive had.

For the poor ambience of the outlet, i felt that the great chirashi is top expensive. For that price, i would rather enjoy this chirashi in a restaurant.
Overall the chirashi tasted decent,just the price is too high for a cheap looking outlet.

If you're craving for tamago. Look no further! They have few other deep fried selections but all are equally good!

Ever since Teppei expanded his operations, the quality of his food has gone downhill.Fish is not as fresh tasting and overly seasoned with soy sauce that makes everything too salty to eat. Worry about food hygiene as well looking at the way the servers handle the raw food at the counters.Will not recommend. Expensive for the quality and portions. Better places to spend your money for better quality.

Teppei serves well-loved Japanese dishes quickly, within minutes of order taking. Ambience is casual. Dine in and takeaways are available. Menu carries varied items including bentos, curry rice, and donburi (rice toppings in a bowl). Please try the chopped unagi kaisen don. Different types of sashimi with wasabi, fish roe and strips of Japanese rolled omelette. For that extra special taste, small diced unagi are placed as toppings beside the sashimi. They claim to import live unagi from Japan and to grill them fresh daily. A little bit pricey with this meal close to S$20. Taste and quantity though are worth it.

No frills fast food type Japanese food. Mainly chirashi don which is raw fish over sushi rice or salad. Don't expect like ultra good quality high grade fish. It's a quick eats type of place. You can select the size of portion you want. $8.80 for S and $15.80 for M. You can select 2 types of fish for S and 4 types for M. There are also add ons for additional fee. Other dishes include Japanese curry and fried bites like cutlets or croquettes. I got the S which was good as a stomach filler if you're not too hungry. Fish is ok not exceptionally fresh wow type. The sauce they drizzled on went well. Wish there was some more soy sauce though. The so-called fresh wasabi isn't really the real deal. It tastes grainy compared to the powdered or tube type but it's not really the fresh root. I've had the fresh grated in front of you type of wasabi root and it's not like that. On the whole, ok. But I'm not really a no frills kinda diner. I'd rather have a proper sit down meal with proper crockery, not paper bowl, and real cutlery, not plastic spoon. Only if I've nothing else to eat and no time then I'll eat this again.

Went here on a Saturday evening. Place was not packed and we decided to give it a try.Ordered the kansei don and curry katsu don. Was not disappointed, both dishes were flavorful and the fish was thick and fresh.Price was a little ok the high side for me
4
The katsu don here is really delicious. However, it is pretty pricey considering that it is not even served in a proper bowl plus the setting of the restaurant is average. Nonetheless, the taste is good!
4
Pork Katsu is succulent and not so hard, compared to many other Japanese curry outlets. Curry itself is good too, the darker variety, a little sour though.
5
I love the chirashi! And every outlet I have been to is always consistent in execution (presentation and flavor). Not a cheap lunch to eat everyday, but it is very tempting.

delicious chunks of marinated salmon and tuna sashimi with an option to top up 4sgd for scallops and a drink at 20sgd. favourite jap food joint to satisfy sashimi craving nearest mrt is promenade.

Date night always ends up getting disappointed by one restaurant, walking away and end up with something unassumingly great. While we tried to order at a large major chain restaurant, we were disappointed with deplorably bad service and late notice that alcohol was dropped from their menu so we walked away and decided to step into a quaint, almost hole-in-the-wall eatery. Teppei Syokudo is just that eatery that won't disappoint. We both ordered their seafood feast which had an option of either one of 4 toppings. Ikura, Hotate, Negitoro or extra sashimi. All for SGD$20 and add $1 for a soft drink. Bowl served in disposal ware and seemed small but trust me, it's satisfying filling in both quantity and quality. The sashimi drenched over that thin layer of well prepared and flavourful rice is heavenly. Each mouthful had bursts of fresh sashimi flavour and the wasabi is good too. Really no regrets and service is pretty good too.

The most popular item is the kaisen don. This outlet gives you the option to choose your own toppings instead of the standard mix. While it is nice to be able to choose, they actually do not stock everything on their menu so you end up choosing what they are already serving in the standard bowl. Do not ever order the mentaiko topping as it is super salty!!! I ended up having to brush them off from my rice and raw fish before i can even swallow

We had lunch and ordered the Kaisen Don. This is what most other restaurants would call Chirashi Don. In short, it is very good.The standard order comes with lots of fish, and you are given the option of adding extra.The fish is extremely fresh and the dish, very tasty.The shop is setup in a no frills fashion, and this helps keep the cost of the dish low. $16. Amazing value for what you pay.Will return

The quality of the food has fallen and it is an expensive meal for what you get.Don't waste your time and money here. Everything is served in plastic but you are charged restaurant prices for meh food riding on Teppei's popularity.It's a cult thing. No other explanation

Have you ever had the feeling watching your takeaway being assembled that you were going to have a bad meal? The server that prepared my teriyaki bento poked gingerly at the chicken being heated in the saucepan like he was a newbie in the kitchen.When I got back to the office and proceeded to take the plastic bento box out of the carrier bag, I discovered that the teriyaki sauce had pretty much leaked out of the bento and coated the bottom of the carrier bag. They also also included a dollop of mayo in the bento (not sure what that was meant to be paired with - not the chicken, rice or pickles I don't think). The server had placed the hot chicken on top of the mayo so that was nicely adding to the mess in the bag too. The shop should have used a bowl style takeaway containing if they were going to put in that much sauce.Taste-wise the chicken was ordinary - no caramelisation at all so probably the chicken was broiled earlier not grilled and then reheated in the pan. The one redeeming factor - they used proper Japanese short grain rice. Was it worth $15?? Think not.Should have ordered the kaisendon like most people in the queue though the culinary skills on display don't give me much confidence

Came here today to try the Kaisendon with scallops and a drink for $20. This is served in a disposable plastic container and included quite a decent allocation of fish. I think I prefer to have the soy sauce separately rather than mixed with the fish. It was ok but I probably won't be rushing back here
