Food was consistent. Been there many times. Staff were friendly. Pricing is reasonable. General ambience was good
3
Brought my family to Chui Huay Lim for a birthday celebration. The food is generally above average but portion is pretty small and not really value for price we paid
5
My family ♡ the food! Cold crab and the chicken is a must order! ♡ the quiet ambience and good service too! ◡̈
3
The staffs were attentive and patient. However,the food taste normal,not really the authentic teochew crusine which I expect. A bit disappointing
5
The food was very well prepared. The taste was exquisite that bring back good memories. The staff was experience and attentive that certainly make our evening more enjoyable.
5
We went for CNY celebration lunch. It was a 7-course lunch with add on Lo Hei for the occasion. This is the only place we know with Lo Hei prepared in this manner. Fresh vegetable and other fresh and tasty ingredients. The 7-course set lunch was also fantastic.

After a long absence ... forgotten about this joint. I decided it’s time to re visit again. Just 3 of us. We decided to order their signature dishes.Jelly cold meat was ordinary. Wasn’t good as before. Braised goose was not available replaced by braised duck. No WOW factor, n Ngoh Hiang which was the house speciality was a total disappointment.Even the fish maw soup was average.Fried kway teow was good.We ordered a snow pea shoots (Dao Mui) n was delivered Long beans. We rejected as they told us it’s not available so why not tell us in the first place.Overall, from good to average. Nothing to say ... I like it much. Hopeful that food is more consistent. A disappointment indeed.
4
The recep was efficient. The cold crab, assortment dish platter(consist of braised duck,pig trotter jelly,ngoh hiang and prawn ball), kailan with dried sole and kailan kuey teow were just average in taste. The least favourite was the teochew style steamed pomfret because the fish was not as nice and fresh as we expected and it was quite bland. Our favourite dish is the chill prawn Chinese wine,it was full of flavour and the prawns are fresh and delicious. Service wise, I felt they were under-staffed and therefore lacked in the service department. The restaurant is well lit and is was bustling with noise of the patrons. If you are looking for privacy, then get the private rooms. Speaking of this,Chopes (the service provider who provides online booking) doea not have the option to select common dining or private rooms
5
A group of us try to meet for lunch at CHL every month since middle of last year. We like their traditional Teochew food, especially some of the comfort dishes like fish porridge, oyster omelet, cold crab .... our next gathering is an occasion we look forward to the minute we leave the CHL.
5
treated my stuff to this nice and classy teochew resto. The service is good. They give you transparent plastic so tt you can put yr hp inside it and without dirtying them. Good thinking. The food is excellent. Promfert is excellent. The dishes were great. The price is on the high side. (fish is $10/100g) but very fresh. Good place for family gathering. Service is excellent and the atmosphere is one of the best teochew resto i have visited
5
The food is excellent with a great service for dinner. The value of food just good with signature Teochew dishes are really delicious.
4
Not being a Teochew myself I wasn't sure how authentic the food was going to be. But expectations around the table seem to be met and the mood was positive n the whole.
4
Honestly there are just as nice Teochew cuisine in other parts of Singapore with lower prices but if you are looking for a nice ambience, this place is highly recommended.
5
Came here to celebrate our parents' birthday and I must say that the food and service was excellent!
4
Great service and great food. Just expensive though. But food quality is always dependable. Will come back.
4
Thanks for the nice gesture to give us a pte room. However the serving staff was too enthusiaistic n hardworking..kept clearing the empty plates and cutlery..do try to give us some privacy during the dinner.
4
Ordered the hay zho, steamed promfet among other food items. Somewhat the food didn’t seem as tasty and staff also seemed short handed on a Friday lunch.
5
Excellent food and ambience. The high ceilings made the place very grand. Order the braised duck. It’s a must try
5
Super food for the price. My favorite items were: the PuNing chicken, the cold crab, and the teochew fish soup with handmade fishball and bamboo pith. I also like the porridge with condiments. These were good value for money, though the chicken and crab has been known to be sold out for the night if you order late.Some people liked the suckling pig, which was nice, but I kept thinking of the poor pig... and the price
4
This restaurant is famous for their teochew food and is often fully booked during weekend. Food is serve promptly partly due to the fact that there is a time limit of 100mins for dining. Food is very fresh and quality is very good. Pricing wise it is on the high side, average about $70 per.pax
4
As a high end Teochew restaurant, I expect the Captains to be more refined in their words and demeanor. The waiters and waitresses are excellent in their service attitude. Some of the dishes are overpriced though the quality is good.
5
Chui Huay Lim Restaurant provides not only good food but also good service! The menu is indeed authentic Teochew cuisine. Notably, the oyster omelette dish is comparable in standard to those served in Shantou restaurants.
4
Cozy environment serving good quality, authentic teochew cuisine. Good service and extensive menu. Particularly like the teochew cold crab and 走地雞.
5
Went for the typical dishes of Teochew Cuisine. The taste never fail us.
Although was disappointed as 2 of the desserts were not available on that day.
5
Love the sickling pig at this restaurant. Order the HK one 3 days in advance. Super yum. All other dishes are very good except the Pomfret that was disappointing.
5
Service was attentive and food quality was good. For the price that we paid I must say this will be a restaurant that I will frequent more often!
5
excellent teochew food. love the crispy oyster eggs, steam thread fin tail and the fried kuay teow. will go back again with family and friends
3
Food tasted authentic and very nice, but we had to wait 1 hour for our food! Despite asking for the food and being told it's "coming soon" numerous times... And it's not even CNY! I had the same experience during CNY but didn't expect it on a normal sunday afternoon. Things are pretty pricey too, $90+ or more for a fish..
4
We had a lovely birthday lunch at Chui Huay Lim on a public holiday. The regular dinning room was full and hence we were seated in the banquet hall on level 2. I was expecting to wait longer for the food, and possibly not as good service since we were in the "annex". To my pleasant surprise, the service was much better than all the other times I've eaten in the main dinning room. The wait staff was attentive, friendly, and prompt.The traditional teochew dishes we had such as the pork jelly, braised duck, prawn rolls, steamed promfret, fried mee sua were all authentic and tasty. Our 92-year-old teochew matriarch gave her stamp of approval too.
5
Food & service are excellent.They did not change my noodle dish to mee sua even though I called to remind them. But they were quick to compensate - we were given free: bâ€™day buns, fresh fruit platter and cold tau huey dessert.This was the second time in a week the did not change noodle dish to mee sua as requested. It happened on Sunday, too.
5
Consistency delectable Teochew cuisine and excellent service. Its my 5th visit and the quality of food never fails to impress. Serving of food is well pace and prices are reasonable for such high quality food.
4
The food is always delectable, yum yum. Definitely one of the authentic Teochew cuisine.
Good staff although one wish they could be more attentive.
5
Best Teochew food ever. The cold crab is amazing. Go for the braised duck and fish maw soup. Perfect to the palatte!
4
Authentic teochew cuisine in a cozy environment. Service is good as well. A pity that they don't have braised goose on that day ☹
5
Food is good as usual, ambiance is good too. Service staffs are attentive as usual. Still one of my favourite Chinese restaurant of all time.
5
Consistently delicious and authentic Teochew food with excellent service. Always a delight to dine here with family.
4
The food is delicious and great, especially the duck.
We will recommend to our friends and will visit Chui Huay Lim Teochew again.
5
Chui Huay Lim Teochew Club has 2 well-known Teochew restaurants - Chui Huay Lim Restaurant and Ng Ah Sio Bak Kut Teh. I have not tried the latter but rave about the former. The restaurant is run by the Jumbo Group and we all know Jumbo food is fantastic. Reasonable price for the quality. If you like seafood, this is the place to go to. The Lobster dish is great, so is the fish and the abalone vegetable dish. The ambience of the club is another reason to visit. You will be charmed by the architectural frontage and the spacious rooms for your own private events. A very good place for family celebrations
5
A fantastic & yummilicous evening at Chui Huay Lim, my French guests couldn't cease praising the superior cold crabs and enjoyed it tremendously !! And we were pampered with such excellent service.Highly recommended for those who have yet to visit Chui Huay Lim. Do make a 'booking' for the crabs so as to avoid any disappoint if it's sold out ha ha..
4
This is one of our favourite chinese restaurants! Our family favourites are the oyster omelette, ngioh hiang and salted egg prawns. Standard of food is consistently good!However, I was quite taken aback by the service of a male staff by the surname of Chan/Chua i couldn't recall. Firstly, he came to ask if we'd like to have any drinks eg juice, tea. I told him we'd order later. Less than 5min later, he came by to ask if we have decided on the drinks. Secondly, i asked him how is the Teochew Stir Fry Scallops done ie with what seasoning and he gave a shocked look (like we have this dish?) When i pointed it out to him on the menu, he tried to "smoke" me by saying that it is stir fry and no further description eg is it more of spicy, salty, stir fry with? Lastly, he asked if we'd like to have any desserts and when i said no, he repeated No? with like a big question mark on his face.Mind you, this service staff was in suit so i reckon he must be a manager yet his service is definitely not of manager level
5
Very busy dinner venue but great food. Pre-ordered the suckling pig and crab. The pig was the highlight. Each piece of skin was accompanied with lovely marinated meat underneath.
Easy enough to get to. Walking distance from Newton MRT.
3
Lobster was not cooked to my liking. Overall experience is so so. It does not feel like it's worth the amount paid.
4
Excellent Teochew food. Favourite dishes are braised duck, mee sua and yam dessert. Attentive service. The place is a little noisy especially when it is packed full house. Have been there a few times to entertain overseas visitors.
5
lovely place to be when I want to have a special chinese dinner.
service is good, food is great and environment is lovely.
just that location is difficult without a car.
recommend
5
We ordered the signature dishes such as braised duck, steamed pomfret , handmade fishball soup and so on. The ingredients were all very fresh and the dishes were very refined. A tad on the expensive side, though.
5
Food was excellent in this restaurant. Service was good too. I went with my family and everyone was satisfied.
5
Good service all round. Nice place for all occasion and karaoka room for peoples who love singing.
Parking lots no problem.
5
Tried this once during the lunch period. Service was excellent and very accommodating. Wide varieties of Teochew cuisine available and great-tasting! I loved the braised goose feet - so soft yet full of taste. Its porridge has to be one of the best i've tasted. With plenty of ingredients, it was smooth on the throat and fragrant
4
Came to this place with my friends for my birthday.First up, the ambience is great and the service was excellent, no complaints about it.The food was generally good.I loved the braised duck and also the liver roll. The olive leaves fried rice had wok-hei. The fried pork rib (individual portion) was also delicious.However, this place isn't that cheap so for me, I will only be back for special events
5
We booked the private room with 10 people. Brought a bottle of our own wine and also had their wine, Jacob's Creek. As a Cantonese restaurant, they are not familiar with red wine so I cannot say much. But I did not like that they used the same red wine glass for different wines. The server also did not know how to pour red wine. Food was delicious and very pleasing to the eye. The server always explained every dish and portioned it well for us. We enjoyed the private room and the server was not intruding at all. I loved the dessert, yam paste. So delicious with gingko nuts
5
Food was great, especially the crispy skin suckling pig. Cold crab was heavenly too. Service was outstanding.
2
Good service but food average. Pricey crabs and fish. Reservation is a must on weekend. Preferably one week in advance.
4
The roasted sea cucumber with mushroom is the greatest dish among others. Second is the toufu with japanese mushroom.
4
Authentic Teochew Cuisine which makes us come back yearly to try out new items.
Recommended the grilled sea cucumber which is unique to Chui Huay Lim.
5
Expensive, but value for money. The food was good and service provided was impeccable. My parents and children loved it.
5
Service is great ! And food quality is authentic Teochew. 5 of us spent S$200.10 for weekday lunch. The restaurant was pretty full even on a weekday. It testifies to it's wonderful service and delicious dishes.
3
This restaurant offers dishes not to be found in the average Chinese cuisine restaurant. We had a set meal and as strangers to this cuisine, were able to try items such as sea cucumber, fish swim bladder and oyster omelette. I would advise not going there with any food finicky Westerner
3
We had a group business dinner here. The service was poor and not friendly. Typical of Chinese places in Singapore. I was not impressed. The best dish was the whole pig. Yummy but looked scary. I really disliked the service staff and would not dine here again.
3
I love Teochew food and I tried almost all the Teochew Restaurants in Singapore. However, quite disappointed that the standard of Teochew food is dropping as compared to the good old days. CHL is considered one of the better one currently in Singapore, but I still miss the distinctive flavor and taste of Teochew cuisine. Hope that CHL can improve the cooking skills to present the authentic style of Teochew cuisine
3
The restaurant has a modern feel to it but as far as the food goes, there is really nothing new or outstanding about it. The menu is large and offers the usual Teochew dishes.Imho, the food is not as good as those served in other grand dames of Teochew cuisine like Hung Kang, Teochew Huat Kee, Liang Kee or Guan Hin. To me, it is at most, passable. It's signature roasted suckling pig fell short of expectation. So did the other dishes that followed. The teochew-style steamed parrot fish was unbearable. One bite was enough to put me off that dish
4
I am very satisfied with the food and will definitely be coming soon next month for dinner to celebrate my Mother's Birthday with immediate families
5
Restaurant had typical Teo Chew food, steamed Garoupa, braised goose, ngoh hiang, oyster omelette (rather gluey style), spinach w 3 types of eggs, cold crab and of course, lek tau Suan and most popular oh ni.
Plenty of undercover parking. Near Newton circus.
Highly recommended.
5
One of the best Teochew restaurants in town. Good services, good food. Lots of parking space. Nice and friendly staffs.
5
We enjoy eating at this restaurant because of the variety and freshness/quality of food. Ambience is good, not too noisy and the service staff courteous. We especially appreciate the first and last serve of Chinese tea - tastes good.
4
Consistent authentic teochew food which never fail my expectations. Only complain is we had to clear our table within 2 hours as they have 2 dinner seatings.
5
My usual order would be braised duck/goose, 走地鸡,liver he zo, spinach in 3 eggs, steamed grouper in caipo, olive fried rice. Every dish is good!
4
Try the Cold Crab, it was heavenly and delicious. The food served was very good quality taste. The service was also tentative. It was a wonderful dinner in a grand setting.
4
Impressed with the food quality and service. Price wise, slightly on the high-side. I will go back again to the restaurant to try other dishes. We had Suckling Pig, Fried Oyster, Braised Duck, Steamed Promfret, Braised Sea Cucumber, Fried Noodles and Almond Dessert and Oh Nie. One thing they can improve further is their wash room. Can be cleaner and add fragrance to the environment.Overall, quite impressed
5
Reservations are well done, confirmation of booking is of paramount importance. Highlighting the timing of meals and reminder tor booking is great too. Almost all staff are well trained, taking care of customers well. The foods selections are quite well spread, ambience is nice especially in the VIP rooms. Price for fish and meat are fairly competitive, but as for vegetables and vegetarian dishes arelightly overpriced. Roast Pig would be good if it is sold not by one whole, if spread may be well as family of five may not be able to consume. Generally I always tell friends and relatives it is a good place to dine. Thank you so much and good day
5
Visited this restaurant after a long absence of more than a year. Always liked it before and it lived up to my expectations. The quality has been and remained consistently good. In particular, we enjoyed the vegetable conpoy which was delicious. The kai lan with dried sole was done to perfection - crunchy but not under cooked. The service was efficient and professional
5
First time here, the food and service was beyond expectation, definitely will go again.
but location wise, better if driving.
5
Braised duck, oyster omelette, prawn cum meat rolls are must haves, which goes extremely well with the plain porridge!
5
Its been a while since we ladt went to Chiu Huay Lim. But food quality and service remains just as good if not better. Certainly still one of the best Teochew restaurants in town of your budget permits
4
my family is always a fan of this restaurant. great for family events, many recommended dishes like braised duck, oyster omelette, steamed promfret etc. enjoyed discount as we are jumbo group member
5
A visit here to satisfy Teochew cuisine cravings never fails to satisfy, even for someone not of z Teochew heritage.
4
Been to this place quite a few times and somehow the food standard has not drop yet. Food is still damn good and worth the money paid for it.
4
Overall an enjoyable meal. Wait staff who took order was helpful but missed a condiment that we requested
3
I have frequent this restaurant for 2 to 3 times a year. The food here is not bad but quite inconsistent. We have tried almost all the dishes in our various visits in the past 5-6 years. We will only stick to a few dishes that we feel it is well cooked and tasty. Liver Roll, Steamed Pomfret, braised duck; Charcoal grilled sea-cucumber; fried oyster cake and our favourite crispy Yam stick (dessert) are the few regular dishes that we will order. Their food prices has increased quite substance for some dishes - the Yam stick dessert for 8 pcs (from $10 to $18) ; the grilled sea-cucumber from $18 to $22 per pc. In one occasion, we have been introduced braised Goose meat instead of duck meat. It was disappointed, it didn't taste better than duck meat, the meat was tough and pricey too. Does not worth the value. Overall, it is still a pleasant restaurant to take family and friends to dine occasional.
5
My first time there. Food was delicious, especially the chicken, duck with beancurd, steamed fish and oyster omelette. The dishes went well with the hot Teochew porridge. Service was also commendable. Staff were attentive, polite and helpful, for example, they even assisted to cut the birthday cake.Recommended but be prepared to pay more.. We spent $400+ for 8 adults and 4 kids
4
Recommended by friends as one of singapore favourite Teochew restaurant for the past few generations. Had the porridge menu and enjoyed the chicken, salted vegetables very much. The oolong tea was particularly good - lightly frangrabt with a lingering sweet after taste. Highly recommended if you decide to visit
5
Authentic and delicious teochew cuisine. Food was fresh. Service was good. Price is on the high side. Not a place you can go frequently but for special occasions it's a nice restaurant with good food.
2
Service attitude of the manager was extremely poor, it was as if he couldn't be bothered with us which made us felt incredibly unwelcome. The wait time in between each dish was ridiculously long which is absolutely unacceptable.
5
Enjoyed the platter and teochew pomfret very much, fresh and well executed dishes. The yam paste was one of the best I've had.
3
I had high hopes for this restaurant based on friends' recommendations. However most dishes were mediocre. I doubt I will return anytime soon.
5
Had the set course dinner. Dishes were pricey but fresh and tasty. Extremely polite staff and good ambience. Highly recommended.
5
Excellent. Food is good. service is excellent. Great experience. The Teochew food is authentic and tastefully cooked. My extended family are teochews and they enjoyed it.
pricing wise is actually quite ok given the food, atmosphere, service amd location. Impressed. Can redo!
4
We had a family birthday dinner at CHL and the food was very good. It's a tradition to return to this restaurant for birthday meals as the restaurant food quality and service have always been top notch.
4
This is one of the best Teochew restaurants I have eaten in Singapore.The food is yummy and fresh albeit served in small portions.Recommended are their signature dishes braised goose meat with tofu,fried oyster omelette and steamed promfret. As the restaurant is packed during lunch /dinner (especially weekends and public holidays) advance reservations necessary.Prices are on the high side but with the top class food served it was worth to pay the extra
4
While there are several good Teochew restaurants in Singapore, each are good at its own few dishes. Chui Huay Lim is located near Newton Circus, though within a club premise but you need not be a member to dine at this restaurant. My perennial Teochew comfort food are:(1) steam promfet Teochew style(2) braised goose meat with tofu(3) braised Conpoy with Eight Vegetarian Treasures.I will be a happy soul if any of these 3 dishes pairs with plain rice or plain porridge....anytime
4
This is a good place to visit, especially iif you are coming with family. Car park spaces are sufficient, and this establsihment is located in a very central part of Singapore. At the same time, it is tucked away so not many Singaporeans are even aware of it. This restaurent is run by the Jumbo chain of seafood restaurants, so quality is quite consistent. For crowd favs such as their suckling pig dish, it is better to order in advance as they do run out quite fast, especially on weekends. Rooms are available too, with no minimum spend
4
A favourite restaurant for our family as it is close to where we live when we feel like some traditional Teochew fare
2
Service was slow and staff was inflexible. While other restaurants want to increase their membership pool, Chui staff was highly relunctant when we asked. Took us half an hour to get the bill settled
5
The captain was very proactive in giving us suggestions that I would consider honest and insightful.
4
Our family has visited here several times and the food never disappoint us. Highly recommend their Ngoh Hiang and fried yam dessert!
5
I had dinner with my friends at Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine. We ordered 5 dishes and the best would be the Fish Mall and Crab Meat. Overall great experience and dining place.
4
One of the most authentic Teochew cuisine. Seafood is fresh and well cooked to its right texture. Family love the food very much. Though restaurant is not full, service is slow as not enough staff. Have to wave few times to catch attention of the staff for additional orders
4
I went there with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. It was a very pleasant experience from making the reservation to the food and the service. I am impressed even by the clean and impeccable toilets. Only downside was one lady mainland Chinese manager was a bit cold. Otherwise it was a great experience overall. Good job to the staff and management. We will definitely be back
4
Ths place is always packed on the weekends. Typical Teochew food and mostly really good. They had some special dishes, sea cucumber or something, was too tough. But it's not my jam anyway aka I didn't order it! But their cold crab is really delicious! Goose meat and tau kua is another favorite for me. They have two seatings, really do need to make a reservation especially on the weekend. Fair amount of parking (if not seriously, go to the next lane, there's street side parking on kampong java). If you have a big gathering they have some pte rooms for groups
4
Food here is good so is the service. If you want to visit during weekends or public holidays, you must make advance reservation or else most probably you will be disappointed. Price is on the high side. Estimated spending per person for normal dinning is S$80. Come with at least 4 persons so that you can order more dishes to share
5
Our visit was to celebrate our mom's birthday. We ordered the steamed pomfret, braised goose, kailan and fries five spiced rolls. They all taste very good and authentic as Teo chew dishes and the yummy yam paste desserts.All the staff were very friendly even though we didn't order too expensive dishes and no one 'chased' us off even though it was near their closing hour at 10pm
5
A busy restaurant indeed. Food is great, subtle flavour and taste with good presentation and service. The cold dish, chicken, sea cucumber, ribs and mee suah are excellent.
4
Looking for authentic teochew cruisine? There is no other place than Chui Huay Kim. Do make sure you have reservations before heading down. If you are into singing karaoke while eating, you may book the one with a private room. Minimum spending of 500 bucks.
4
Good food, fair value but service is a bit lacking. Oyster omelette is very good and highly recommended
5
Food quality is really good and I love the ambience of the restaurant. The food were presented well and the staff were helpful in their recommendation.
5
Good Teochew Food. the fried oyster is tad disappointment though. Too greasy with small oysters. The duck is succulent. The meepok is too ordinarily but the kueh teow has good wok hei.
3
The restaurant is situated on a quiet road just off busy Newton circus. A lot of repeat customers to be seen. We ordered the yusheng since it's still CNY period. The yusheng is quite different from the traditional one with lots of greens,it looked more like a western salad. The signature steamed pomfret is huge hence it was inevitably over cooked. Braised goose wings could be a tad more tender. Mee suah is most yummy with wok hei. Service was adequate inspite of a full hous
5
Go there for Chinese New Year dinner , found their food ( shark fin soup , ' yu sheng ' , seafood , vegetable ) very fresh and taste excellent . Their sevice also very good . Is worth of money to ate at the resturant 
5
The standard of food is consistent. We love the lobster salad, ngor hiang, stewed vegetable, goose. And no meal would be complete for me without their fried mee suah (a noodle dish). I am not a fan of shark fin soup but the broth and quantity and quality of shark fin is good indeed. Dessert is always optional for me as I prefer my savouries. But I am told their orh ni (a traditional teochew made of yam paste) is good. Tip: best to avoid during peak season like Chinese New Year. Too many functions.Tip: order cold crab when in season.Good to visit with a minimum small group of four so you can try a variety of dishes. Bon appetite everyone
4
The food is truly authentic teochew style. The porridge is smooth and yam paste dessert is also tasty. Perhaps the only shortfall is the staff at times forgot the ordered items. However, I gave them the benefit of doubt that they're busy due to the restaurant is full house then
3
We had a party of 4, took the 2nd seating at 8pm. Was given a terrible table facing the path to the kitchen and toilet. Tried their signature dish, a steam pomfret but it was over cooked and at 95 dollars. The chilli crab was excellent, the duck was also good, but a plate of small veg was 20dollars. Must try their fry yam with crystallised sugar; very few Resturant could do such dessert dish. W
5
Food and service was good. The steamed pomfret was the highlight; steamed just right and super fresh. Most enjoyable.
5
Excellent place to go to. Have been celebrating my birthday there for the past few years. Love the food and ambience and attentive staff.
4
Have the best Teochew dishes, light, not heavy & very tasty. Nice ambience, great location, away from the hustle & bustle of the shopping mall. Really relaxing & no stress.
5
The food, as usual, was very tasty and fresh. Staff was also attentive and food was served rather promptly. Always enjoyed my visits.
4
Very pleasant restaurant and very good quality of food. Only problem is that the oyster omelette was served more than 30 mins after we had the last fish.
4
Food was great as usual. Autheric Teochew food at it best with good service y the server. Only thing is that the desert took awhile to be serve due to the cooking time.
5
Very nice food and good service. Only drawback is the location. Can be a lil tad difficult to find. 👍🏼
5
Very ice Teochew food.
Good service and very friendly staff.
Love the Goose/tofuand the yam dessert.
Don't have to be a member to eat here.
Price is reasonable, good for entertaining friends.
5
They reserved a room for our group of 8 persons. It was great because there was a karaoke singing system that comes with the room. He kids enjoyed it very much.The food and especially the service was outstanding. We would definitely come back here again.
4
food was amazing as usual, the platter is a must order so was the ngoh hiong and liver side dish. salted egg yolk prawn was creamy to the right extend so it was very good!!! no doubt, the cold crab was yummy and I loved it (it was their signature dish.) BUT THEIR DOWNFALL WAS THAT HORRENDOUS WAITING TIME FOR EVERY DISH. each plate came out almost one by one and I have to wait at least 15-20mins for the next to arrive. Have never experienced this until yesterday so I was a little disappointed this time. Nonetheless great dinner and friendly staffs :)
4
V. good. Repeatable.
Esp for family gathering. Location is ok but off the busy netwon circus.
Recommended to Teo chew people and others who like good chinese food.
Price is on the higher side but still quite ok.
5
Chui Huay Lim has been our go-to restaurant for family celebrations and gatherings for years. The standard of the food is consistent and our favorite dishes include chili crab and braised duck. Service is also prompt and often a step ahead .
5
The staff were rushed off their feet but they were great, smiling all the time. Attentive even though very busy.
2
Food not too bad but don't have WOW kind of feel! Service is poor & not attentive. Have to wait long time to top up water for tea, same goes to billing.
5
Healthy and heart-warming traditional food we really missed! We goose with wine... moreover they are affordable!
5
Besides its braised duck, toufu, spring roll which are authentic, goose meat and steam fish are clearly among top three in Singapore. The cold crabs are a must try although the season is coming to an end now. They also have some nice New Zealand white wine to go along with the dishes. Not to mention the traditional yellow wine to go with the crab.The uninitiated may find the pre-meal Chinese tea somewhat bitter but old timer will enjoy both pre and post meal Chinese tea.
5
The service here is excellent. Our waiter Po Han was extremely patient, attentive and efficient. He catered to all our demands with a warm smile and great enthusiasm. Such level of service is indeed rare these days. The superior shark fin here is absolutely fabulous, natural and delicious. However, if you're used to spices, it will be rather blend. As usual, the Teochew braised goose was perfect but the chilli garlic sauce that came with it was terrible as compared to other Teochew restaurants. The liver roll is nice but it could have been thicker in size. With the longevity buns, would have preferred the shape to be much rounder. The paste of the longevity buns had a strong oil taste too. All dishes were served quickly except the fried seafood mee sua which took 30mins! They apologised and said kitchen was short-handed. But it was worth the wait. The mee sua was simply divine, just the right texture and flavour. It's quite addictive as I was craving for more the next day! Would definitely be back soon

This is a great place for a family gathering. The restaurant allocated for us a private room so it was really nice and undisturbed from the rest of the area. Service was good, the lady who served us was attentive to our needs and we never had to ask for a refill of tea cause she would always be there. The mian xian there is FABULOUS, overall enjoyed our Set H menu, which was quite interesting to some dishes done in a different way. My dad enjoyed the celebration for his 60th birthday and I would say that this will not be our last time here! Meal came up to slightly less than 1000 for 10 after a 20% discount.

First time to the restaurant. Did not ordered a lot but it was very filling. Love the cold crab dish as well as the teochew platter and omelette oyster. Rest of the items was so so. Service was prompt in the beginning but attentive started to slow down after a while
4
The staff were friendly and able to recommend dishes, great service, we enjoyed the tea served in small little tea cups! The food was excellent! My family was very impressed! It's a big dining hall - just a bit noisy. But we will come back again for the good food and great service!
5
Good service staff and excellent cuisine. Good for family meals and gathering. Authentic teochew food too.
5
This is a favourite restaurant for Teochew families as even the fussiest of eaters love the food here. The elderly in the family enjoy the dishes too, usually a hard criteria to meet!
5
Strongly recommend advance reservation. Food is delicious and nice ambience. Food portion is reasonable. Would put this in the $$$ category. Ask server about promotional items. Would recommend the suckling pig!
Parking is easy and reasonably priced.
5
Dad loves the pig trotters jelly. Sis loves the oyster omelette. I loves the mee sua and yam paste with ginko nut. Overall, this is going to be the family's favourite restaurant.
Good that carpark is just downstairs too, easy access for the old folks.
5
braised goose, very rare in Singapore, was savoury. the classic dishes like liver roll and fish maw soup were delicious.
4
Filled with old-fogies accompanied by their grandkids, a grand old dame of Teochew cuisine, a dialect group of the Chinese. Try the classics like the ngoh hiang, chilled pigs gelatine and the orh nee dessert. Recommended, but a little bit difficult to get to by public transport, although this tempered by the excellent food, good service and lovely ambience
4
We were leaving Singapore for a Hong Kong posting and our friends hosted dinner here. It was an excellent meal, with attentive service. We especially liked the little cups of tea at the start and end of the meal, which served as a palate cleanser.We started with a few appetisers, including ngoh hiang which had both normal and liver versions. They were good, though I thought the meat was a little too refined - I prefer slightly chunkier and chewy pieces. We also had braisd duck with tofu, and steamed pomfret Teochew style, both of which were excellent. We had orh nee, or their signature yam paste, for dessert and all of us enjoyed it.There are other Teochew restaurants that are just as good, if less expensive, but this is Teochew cuisine at its finest
3
Remember going to this place a few times before and overall have always had a pretty good experience. Was told during reservation that a few dishes were needed to be pre-ordered and we did. However when arrived, was told that those dishes were not pre-ordered. But still able to be ordered. Which made me a little suspicious about the quality of what was served to us. Although the food was still decent, a decrease in quality and standard was noticed. I found the food not as fresh and not executed as well as they did before. For example the suckling pig was quite black on some parts and the fish was just not as fresh as what it used to be. Flavour on most of the dishes was alright but lacking that standard that demanded the high prices being charged. Service was good. No complaints.
4
Was disappointed they didn't consent to a complimentary dessert for the birthday girl although we have a $100 voucher. We are only asking for a small dessert for the B'Day girl not for everyone. We had to spend over $200 to utilize the voucher which is too much food.
4
When we dine here, must-have dishes are braised goose/duck (don't miss the chilli vinegar dip!), with an extra portion of silky tofu, prawn rolls, pig trotters jelly, oyster omelette, yam paste and prawns with salted egg yolk - shelled and perfect for lazy folks like us! If you like, have these with porridge, a teochew staple, done just right, simple yet truly satisfying. The fried kway teow can be inconsistent, sometimes too salty, at times lacking the wok hei (literally wok's breath). Steamed pomfret is hit and miss, we don't usually order that as it can be prepared by most home cooks, and for less. We have hosted friends and held celebrations here, and our guests and family members have always found the food good, and service attentive. For us true blue teochews and finicky eaters, Chui Huay Lim hits the spot. Reserve ahead or you'd be disappointed, as weekends and holidays can be really busy
4
Food was good and we enjoyed the quiet surroundings. Not very busy n maybe that's why the service was good too.
4
The food is good. Service is good but the reception is average as there is nobody around when we were there even we pressed the bell for service
4
The service is good, the ambience is great. Parking space is readily available. The price is slightly on the higher side.
2
Food was ok overall. But the service staff kept wanting to clean up our plates although we had not finished. The overall ambience feels very noisy for a fine dining experience.
4
We ordered the set menu for 12 pax and vegetarian for 1 pax. Food is yummy. Will definitely be back again.
4
The Pomfret Fish Soup is very tasty with lots of ginger and the Pu Ning Chicken is unusual and delicious. We love the cold crab as a starter and the Tau Suan (beats the Orh Nee) for dessert.
5
Still the best Teochew restaurant for my oyster omelette, treadfin tail, liver rolls and of course yam paste with ginkgo
1
The standard of the food has dropped. They simply are too busy. What was horrifying was that 3 items on the menu was not available - the most popular steamed pomfret, Kai lan and the fishball soup. The staff stated as a matter of fact despite it being a Saturday night! What made it worse was the extra birthday cake (half remained) somehow got "lost". How does that happen?! What made it horrific was the nonchalance of the staff. They again stated as a matter of fact that they could not find it. For some reason it was given to another table? Even though there was no other table with a cake? This is horrible service and totally unacceptable. Never to return. This is not the first time. When I was there a year ago, the remainder of the suckling pig also got "lost" in the mix. Is this seriously a mistake that recurs
4
Good food, good service!! MUST take Ngor Hiang/Hae Zhor as starter and end the meal with dessert ‘sweet yam paste with pumpkin and ginko’, it is not too sweet with special fragrant… The pomfret soup is special and tasty.Seafood mee sua, stir fried kailan are good and not oily
5
The food here is excellent . A place that u must visit. U must tell them that you want ot teochew style. The sharkfin soup was the best. U can drink a clear spup with a whole place of shark fin. So satisfying. It give U a feeling that u will not want to eat from other anymore. The other fopd like fish is also good. Really good restaurants but price is expensive but it is definitely worth it.
4
Food was good. Service was great too. Counter should be able to renew the membership card instead of asking the guest to go to the website to renew.
5
This place is a family favourite. We've been here many times to celebrate various occasions and almost always end up ordering the same dishes over and over. Must-orders include the braised duck, single serve pork ribs and spinach tofu. Simple dishes executed perfectly.
5
The food is very good especially the cold craps. It's highly recommended for Teochew cuisine. It's worth to join the Jumbo's membership for discount.
3
The food is great on the whole. Staff are polite but service is quite slow. We had waited for at least 15 minutes to have our dessert to be served.
4
Business dinner wit ha large group in a private ordered by a local citizen, think I would have been confused on the menu choices without his guidance. The service was superb and the variety of foods was outstanding
3
I hv been to this restaurant a few times but recently was disappointed on my last visit there. The food was very salty and the spinach which was normally tasty was bland. The garlic crab was Saltish and disappointing, the fish in the pot was also Saltish The only dish that was up to standard was the pork jelly
3
There were four of us for lunch. We ordered the steam pomfret which was over steamed resulting in non tender flesh. The liver roll had more yam than liver. The kai lan kway teow was $16 with no ingredients at all and no "wok hei" also tasteless. The braised conpoy vegetable was well braised but the scallops were hard. The braised duck was ok

醉花林 (Chui Huay Lim) Teochew cuisines lifts up to her poetic Chinese name where diners get dizzily intoxicated through the food. That said, while the environment is pleasant and spacious, it is hardly enchanting as alluded by the Chinese characters ”花林”. Credit however to filling the spaces with brilliant works of Chinese calligraphy. If you're like me, wallowing in the untimely demise of another Teochew cuisine institution, Lee Kui or more affectionate known to Singaporeans as "Ah Hoi" or by her Chinese name《李貴(亞蟹)席館》, Chui may just be able to fill your "loss".No visit to a Teochew restaurant is complete without tasting their braised duck. Chui's dish is deliciously done with the correct amount of tenderness to the meat. Your more traditional Teochew friends may say that the braised goose is the true Teochew experience and in fact you can try this at Chui too if you're prepared for the heftier price tag. The cold pork jelly may not be for the faint-hearted but if you're game, culinary heaven awaits as you bite into the chilled dish. The pork is encased with a thin wall of jello which essentially is created by refrigerating the stock and meat overnight transforming the collagen turns into a gelatin. Another popular dish is the Teochew cold crab. For this dish, Chui has chosen the most succulent crustacean, boiled it before serving it cold. While seemingly simple to prepare, what is delectable about this dish is what locals refer to as the "gor", commonly thought to be crab roe but is really crab milt. The taste of the milt reminds one of foie gras only much lighter in texture.Finally, a visit to Chui is better during the weekday. I noticed that the food appear better prepared. Perhaps differentiated due to the less rushed seating in not having to meet the weekend demand, hence ensuring more attentiveness from her kitchen. Reservation is strongly recommended when dining there.Keith23 May '1

Excellent food and service at this restaurant as always. Since the visit this time was for mom's 92nd birthday lunch, I booked a private room as the place is always packed on a weekend.Although expensive, it was worth it nevertheless in order to avoid the crowded tables outside.We had the usual Teochew offerings such as fish maw soup, braised goose and steamed fish which was part of their Mother's Day set menu, but with some minor changes or additions. Replaced the olive rice with birthday fried mee-sua noodles, and the rice ball dessert with orh-nee.
3
Had dinner with the boss and guests in one of the private dining rooms and was a little disappointed at the service and food. The cold platter was average and basically a sign of the food to come. Teochew cuisine is more than braised sauce which was the dominant flavour. The soup was a hodgepotch and tasted like one. Overall, there wasn't much surprise or flavour. The dessert sealed the impression - again, Teochew flavour is not merely dried tangerine skin. Definite room for improvement. And the fact that there was a persistent fly was a definite appetite killer
5
Read many good reviews and decided to try this place. We were impressed. Excellent teochew food. Especially like the pork jelly, which is extremely rare. The cold crab is also good quality. We enjoyed the dinner very much.
5
There are not many TeoChew (Chao Zou) restaurants in Singapore and even fewer good ones. This is the best but be prepared for significant damage to your wallet. Service is excellent.
4
Nothing fancy. Traditional Teochew cuisine. Very crowded but quick service from the staff. Downside: restaurant quite noisy. Conversation difficult due to noise.
5
Quality food and quality service. Brought my parents and in-law to this place and they fell in love with the food. Authentic Teochew fare which taste just the same when they were young. Definitely a crowd puller especially for the older generation. Food freshness was super
4
The restaurant is located inside the Chui Huay Lim club. Was here on a weekday night for a family dinner get-together. It's an ideal place for delicious Teochew cuisine in a large group, perfect for gatherings definitely as they also have private rooms for I think tables with 12 guests and a minimum spending of $500 if I'm not mistaken. They have a good selection of Teochew favourites like pig trotter jelly, braised goose (half or whole), liver hay chos, oyster omelette etc which we tried and loved. The meal cost over $400 for 9 pax with pepper crab and Chili crab.
5
The food was excellent especially the boiled prawns and chilly crabs. The service is above average as the waitresses and waitors are attentive. My wish was granted when I requested for a more quiet private corner. The ambience is excellent, the tables are placed quite far apart from each other. The best is the car park facilities as they parking lots size are comfortable
4
Teochew Food is as always, very very good!Suggest that Chiu Huay Lim be more flexible, and get their act with Jumbo Group together - I received a voucher of 25% discount for Cold Crabs, but forgotten about it ( or to print it and bring along.) CHL waiters should have asked for email image on my phone. CHL waiters also mentioned Jumbo vouchers not valid at CHL (I was confused.) Did not want to make a scene in presence of my guests
3
Was here for lunch with visitors; there were five of us. The food is fine; it is basically Teochew cuisine which we have nothing really to complain about. In general, the service was fairly good too but we were surprised when we were shown the bill and asked to pay up while we were still in the midst of eating; our dessert had not even arrived! Yes, it was abt 2.45 pm at that point and we were told (on enquiry) that they close at 3.30 pm but it is really very rude and embarrassing, especially when we were with guests from out of town!The place is also rather noisy - poor acoustics?Location-wise, it is also rather inconvenient. Since it was a weekend, the place was packed; I circled twice (got to make a huge loop through Novena n Newton once you leave the place to get back, as Keng Lee Rd is one-way) but still failed to get a lot. In the end, had to park at Newton Food Court then found out on walking (long n hot way) back to the place, that they allowed ppl to park in front of the building. Could hv informed ppl this early enough? Not going back anytime soon

Had lunch with a group of friends at Chui Huay Lim recently. It was my first visit and I was looking forward to it so much as I have heard how good this placed was.I was completely disappointed with the quality of food. The cold crabs we ordered were not only small but not fresh. We informed the captain and all he said was he would inform the kitchen. In the first place, there wasn't any quality control. They should not have even served these crabs if they are not up to standard. Apart from that, we ordered many other dishes. The liver roll was mediorcal. The steam promfret was over steamed. The braised duck meat was tough. I was at another Teochew restaurant Chao Shan recently. The quality way passed that of Chui Huay Lim. My visit to CHL will be my first and last

Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine Restaurant (”Inebriated Flowers Woods”) - operated by the Jumbo Group of Restaurants since early 2012 - is located in the Keng Lee Road premises of Chui Huay Lim Club (a Teochew “gentlemen/towkay’s” club founded there in 1845). Despite its somewhat off-the-beaten-track location, the restaurant has consistently been enjoying strong patronage and support from both Club members and other hungry members of the public, especially people who like Teochew cuisine. Perhaps it was the weekend crowd, the place was fully packed and bustling throughout the evening.I joined my friend and family for dinner there to celebrate their mother’s 90th birthday on 12 Mar ‘16. The menu comprised: (1) Green salad (with abalone, honey melon and jelly-fish, Lohei-style)(2) Appetiser-platter (ngoh-hiang, liver-roll, shrimp-ball, jellied pork-knuckle)(3) Sharkfin soup (with crabmeat and fishmaw)(4) Baked Boston-lobster (with garlic, fermented bean paste)(5) Steamed soon-hock - marble-goby or lazy fish (with prune, tomato)(6) Dried-scallop (with spinach, mushroom)(7) Braised duck-meat (with fried tau-kua soya-bean cake)(8) Fried mee-suah/fine vermicelli (with prawn, cuttlefish)(9) Tau-suan dessert (with deep-fried dough-fritters, gingko nuts, osmanthus-flower flakes)(10) Longevity peach buns (with yam-filling).The dishes were prepared Teochew-style; overall, very palatable and appetising (neither too oily, too salty nor too sweet). For instance, the tau-suan was absolutely fragrant and also less starchy, compared to other versions elsewhere, the yam-filling in the buns was moderately and aptly sweetened. There was a round of before-food hot Chinese tea as well as a second round of after-food “gungfu” tea, both served in quaintly small cups but both with their own unique fragrance and after-taste.Service was impressive and impeccable, as a dedicated (very unassuming) staff attended solely to our group in the private-room from beginning to end; while her supervisor would occasionally drop in to check on the progress and interact with us.Time passed real fast with good food served at a relentless pace while we filled up the lax minutes with karaoke singing (Cantonese, Hokkien, Teochew, Mandarin and English oldies) and joviality as well as small talk among ourselves. Basically, as the room was superbly sound-proof, everyone was able to relax, be comfortable and have a good time, throughout dinner. The finale arrived with the singing of both the “Happy Birthday Song” (English) and “Longevity Song” (Cantonese), topped by the cutting of the birthday cake
5
Great Teochew food , very true to the cuisine. The Atmosphere was excellent and service was good. Highly recommended
5
Service was excellent. Staff very attentive. Fodd was fantastic especially the salted egg deshelled prawns.. This dish was so wonderful that everyone unanimously agreed to order a second round.
5
Fine food and service. Price was reasonable. Food was fresh.
Overall it was a memorable one. Do try :)
5
A fantastic place to savour the teochew cuisine specialities, all at an exclusive setting. They also have private rooms for small gatherings and a karaoke facility if you're upto some singing, which may come naturally after savouring all the delicacies out here!
5
This place sells out its signature dishes early. Wanted to try the chicken and pork but they were all out of it when i arrived at 7pm for my reservation. Food is great. Must go place if you want to avoid the crowds you normally get on a weekend at the shopping centres
5
It is great. For 5 person the total cost is about $300 & there's a 20% discount for Jumbo member so in the end, the total cost is about $250. About $50 per pax. We do order fish & crab, so the cost is expected to be higher. Overall the feeling is good & the food are good. Only bad thing is that the staff took a long time to serve the or nee (dessert)
3
We had our Chinese Reunion Dinner . We ordered the $888 ++ lobster set menu for 10 persons.The cold platter although tasted good, especially the prawn balls but the presentation was dull,they just put 3 dishes together on a big plate which were the liver rolls, braised sliced duck with tofu and prawn balls, no garnishing, as plain as it could be.Shark's fin soup was rather diluted with very little or no fins. The worst dish of the menu which was supposed to be the highlight & star of the menu like the lobster. Feel short changed for this dish.Steamed Soon Hock fish was not that fresh as it was fishy.Garlic lobster was quite good but this dish has been repeated for every Chinese New Year Menu. How I wish they have something more creative with the cooking of the lobster.Spinach with braised abalone, abalone was good but spinach was tough & chewy.Olive seafood fried rice was quite good.On the whole, the food was average for the price paid. I do not think it's value for money especially with a lousy shark"s fin soup.Will reconsider my reservation with them for my company's staff lunch which I have booked 2 tables the following week
1
The Staffs especially the Lady Captain were not attentive at all. I am asking for help about the restaurant wifi services unfortunately the lady captain told me "I couldn't help Much"!!!!!. One of the lady Staff very Impatient during our ordering with unfriendly reaction. Very Disappointed with this Posh Restaurant.
4
Was lucky enough to be taken here for a business dinner. There was a mix-up at reception with no-one knowing about the booking, but we were finally shown to the private room that had been reserved, and had our name on the door! The rest of the night was faultless, however, with generous amounts of food being served at a good pace. It was a true experience to try things one wouldn't normally have the nerve too: even though they weren't quite all to my tastes
4
I enjoyed the fish maw soup, the oyster omelette and the dessert "oh-nee". This restaurant is owned by Jumbo Seafood group.For improvement:I was eating my noodles when a hand abruptly went across my face. The service staff standing on my right was pouring tea into my tea cup placed on my left side. I had to wait for her to finish pouring tea before I could continue with my noodles. She was not aware that it was disruptive. She should be pouring tea from my left side because my tea cup was placed on my left side.When we engaged in conversations, we had to stop abruptly because the service staff had his or her arm across going about removing empty plates or placing food on the table. As a service staff, you've got to be mindful of "space" for the customer to enjoy the dining experience, not "smelling armpits".The service staff asked if we wanted to bill but we said we were still waiting for our desserts to be served.Were they in a hurry for us to vacate our table so they can bring in customers for the 2nd seating
4
Pretty easy to make reservation. Food is good but a bit pricey. Did not try the cold crab as it has ran out of stock.
4
service was efficient.
disadvantage: customer must be able to speak Mandarin...luckily we had some in our party of 6 who could
2
Dinner for 7.
Stemmed promfert. Suckling pig. Mustard leaf Chicken. Braised Duck. Cold Crab. Seaweed soup,with Fish Maw. Last 2 dishes were decent. The rest were all disappointing. What a let down.
4
Cold Crab is good with plenty of crab roe ! Overall good dining experience though they don't have their signature Yam sticks dessert on that day. Services are prompt and serving of food is fast.
2
- busy staff and ignore customer need.
- problem with credit card machine and cause long waiting for bill payment
4
Food is good. Love the fresh seafood.
Not a fan of fish. But love their steam pomfret.
Those who loves yam paste this is the place to go.
1
Food was average. Goose not available as usual.
Service was slow. One dish took more than 30-45mins to arrive. Bill took 10-15mins to arr after reminders
Power failure in the middle of the meal.
4
My parents in law enjoyed their previous meal and wanted to return here. Operated by the Jumbo group, which is famous for its chilli crab, this restaurant focuses more on Teochew cuisine. We started with their ngoh hiang, both liver and normal, and they were okay, though not outstanding. This was followed by vegetables with scallops, which were very fresh, as well as their signature seafood mee sua - this was delicious, and was dry fried rather than in a soup. They did not have their crispy duck so we had the braised duck, and found the tofu to be soft and tasty, while the duck was not gamey at all. We also had a plate of prawns with salted eggs - while the prawns were largish, firm and fresh, the salted egg was actually a little bland.Service was excellent and the staff kept coming round to top up our teas etc
4
Four of us came here for dinner to celebrate birthday. We ordered the suckling pig, teochew liver rolls, vegetables, deep fried noodle pancake. The braised goose was sold out. The suckling pig is very good and just for right size for 4 diners. The liver rolls and vegetables are good but nothing really special. The deep fried noodle pancake is unusual and served with vinegar and sugar. A very different eating experience.Overall the food tasted good. One of the better Teochew restaurant in SIngapore although their prices are higher than others. Our total bill comes out to about $250
4
Remember to make reservation because Chui Huay Lim is constantly packed! Its a little off the road, and some walking needed if you dont have a car. First impression when stepping into the restaurant is the oriental ambience. Feels really comfortable with the environment though it was a little noisy (you know how most chinese restaurants are like). As it was really a busy place, it took awhile before we were attended to. And a down side is we met a waiter whom on one occasion cut through to pick up an empty plate while my dad was trying to pick up a dish :( Now to the good stuff, my family ordered several "recommended dishes", a few which I would like to share would be: 1. Salted-egg deshelled prawns (yum-yum for salted egg lovers, and no need to peel the shells!) 2. Teochew style baked Crab with garlics (not something you would commonly find outside, and its really flavorful) 3. Hotplate Egg with Oyster (recommended by a friend, the oysters are really fresh and there's a distinct sweet sour reddish sauce on it) 4. Yam with sugar crust (25min preparation time, simply enjoy the fragrant yam coated with sugar was awesome, except that it's a little dry) Try the rest for yourself! A little tip; get the Jumbo Member Card for decent discount
3
The food here is typical average restaurant standards.. Ok. Nothing to complain about..however, none of the dishes stands out too.. I went there more than 3 times but still annoy remember their special dish..
4
overall pleasant experience. they even cut up the cake for us. not a lot of f&b does that in my humble opinion.
4
Housed in the club house of the early Teochew businessmen, this restaurant serves very good Teochew cuisine in a nice setting with warm service. Though a little pricey, they use very fresh seafood. An enjoyable dining experience all in all.
5
Staff were very efficient, so did the cook. Dishes were ready within 15 mins of placing order. The only complain is space between tables is too small.
5
love the food n dining experience.
Highly recommended. Great for family gathering. Will return again
5
Authentic and very tasty Teochew dishes, excellent service, felt welcome and staff are very enthusiastic
5
Great authentic traditional teochew food
Good service and attentive staff
Nice atmosphere
Sufficient parking
4
Went to this restaurant for 3 times over the past 6 months and was very happy each time. It serves very good and authentic Teochew dishes like braised goose meat, "hei zuo", steamed fish and 8 treasures which is essentially mixed vegetables. Reservation is certainly recommended if you are going there during weekend
5
Service was excellent at this Teochew restaurant. They serve free kungfu tea prior to food to improve appetite and top grade ooh loong tea at the end of the meal to help with digestion. Also, upon seeing my smart phone on the table, one wait staff passed me a clear zip lock pouch for the phone to protect from any spillage. Food was good, especially the oyster omelette ($16), spinach toufu ($14), and seafood mee sua ($18). Braised goose was the only disappointment being on the tough side and dry. Overall, a very good meal in a Teochew club near Orchard
4
Has lunch there for three pax, wanted to order the braised goose but it was sold out so has the duck instead which is not as good, the rest of the dishes were very good, a bit expensive when comparing to the others Teochew restaurant but worth it, will go again
5
its a nice place. they have alot of food variety and pricing reasonable. should try!!! comfortable seating! :)
but def must make reservation before you go esp during weekends.
4
With colleagues we had a small banquet here and it was certainly authentic Teochew food as ascertained by my Chinese colleagues. Jellyfish was very nice and the chicken too. I enjoyed the dessert which I find difficult to describe. Certainly recommendable.
5
Tasty & delicious food but a tad expensive. The suckling pig is crispy and not too oily. Will visit again.
4
for my full review: http://shauneeie.blogspot.sg/2014/09/chui-huay-lim-authentic-teochew.html
Good authentic teochew food. Salt Baked chicken, the premium chinese tea and oyster omelette are a must try.
4
really good traditional teochew food on offer. Read more on my thoughts of chui huay lim - http://shauneeie.blogspot.sg/2014/09/chui-huay-lim-authentic-teochew.html
4
Teochew style food was generally good - with the exception of the goose web and wings. They were not tender enough and tasted a little bland.Food ordered generally in line with recommendations made. Service was acceptable and there was corkage waiver on 1st bottle; though the glasses provided then; were what wine people would term 'joker glasses'.But to their credit, 2nd bottle brought about a better quality of wine glasses.Overall a happy experience. 
4
It is not hard to find this place, parking should not be a problem. Heard many praises and my friend strongly recommends this place for our gathering.We did not order too many dishes nor many signature dished but the teochiew style steamed pomfret was steamed for slightly too long, so meat was a bit old and tough, so it is a failure. The prawn was cold when it came to our table. But the Eight Veg Treasures, Liver Rolls and Yam paste are good.I will come back again sometime
4
We had my mom-in-law's birthday pary in one of the private rooms and the food was simply fantastic. The suckling pig (@$200 each) was a crowd favourite, with its crunchy skin and well seasoned and tender meat. Other great dishes included scallops with asparagus, fried prawns with chives, and the two types of ngoh hiang or meat rolls in the appetiser plate. Surprisngly, though, a few of did not like the steamed fish. I thought it was bland while others said it was 'fishy' in taste.You should also try their famous Teochew dessert, orh nee, or yam paste with ginko nut. It was cooked just right, and was not too sweet - certainly a nice ending to the meal.Service was also excellent, and the attentive staff were quick to,pour tea and clear plates etc
5
My husband is a fourth generation teochew though raised in singapore since 1950's..we very often goes around looking for teochew food and we must say tt since returning from Australia, we got a chance to get reservation for a table just for two and it was awesome. .from the cold crab to the braised gooses and suckling pig and not forgetting the dessert of yam paste with ginko.since the last five yeard odd, we have visited this restaurants with my hubby 60th birthday in private room for 20ppls,dinner course of eight dishes to the top prices abt $1200per table and nvety often just sat dinner for 6 or more ppl..the restaurant manager now become a close friend,ms chan haiyan from swaton is alway there to make recommendations for the day..it id always fully booked..so plan advanced like a fortnight n there are seating timing if it for big day like chinese new year etc.never go without reservation to avoid disappointment.

The anchor tenant in a teochew club, this restaurant brings life to a quiet street in a quiet neighborhood. The building is new and elegant, the restaurant feels posh. Good service, great food. Classic teochew dishes including suckling pig, fish maw soup, steamed pomfret, braised duck, ngo hiong, crisp and crunchy vegetables.Everything tastes just right with no residual MSG attack later! Including the cold crab, which means everything is fresh.The only challenge at times is getting a reservation.Worth the price but do get the cost estimate of fresh seafood at time of order to avoid sticker shock

Very good food, good service, ambience noisy. We ordered the S$288 six pax set dinner. Every dish from soup, chicken, fish, vegetable were tasty.

Don't be put of by that fact that this is a club in a small, quiet street and seems to be out of the way. The food is great, especially if you want authentic cuisine.

Impressed with the quality of food. Authentic To chew food. Soup's very tasty. Quality of food is excellent. Service very prompt and staff very attentive. Overall two thumbs up. A bit pricey though...but I think the quality of food compensated.
Environment is very nice.

Food is of high quality as always. August Month special deal for members of 50% for fried Soon Hock fish was a good deal.Their computer clock needs looking into. I made reservation for 12.30pm, but their reminder sent to me on the previous day, stated my reservation was for 11.30 pm and reservation will be held for 15 minutes. I called and they said they will take note of that

Food quality was consistently good over the last 2 trips to this restaurant. I will classify food here as very good restaurant style cooking but lack the Wow factor that are sought after by the foodies. Menu comprised mainly traditional Chaozhou dishes commonly found in Singapore. Service was good and attentive. Ambient was classy and proper. You cant good wrong with this restaurant and is a place I will entertain for both business and social. A very popular restaurant that need to make reservation at least one day in advance

jumbo group have an ongoing amex promotion giving out voucher booklets for every S$120nett spend by amex card. i was given a booklet expiring 30jun2014, and 5 of us arranged to have lunch at chui huay lim on 25.6.2014. i find chui huay lim kind of on the expensive side, but when there were substantive discounts like the good lunch we had on 4.11.2013, then it was pretty worth it.for this time, we were using 1 S$60 voucher which require a total bill of S$150nett or above. i ordered the usual pig trotter jelly, hae chor & cold crab. also ordered 1/2 braised duck, 2 vege & a seafood meesua & ended with orh nee. including tea, bill came to S$111 for 5pax after the S$60 discount. & since we could get another voucher booklet if the net bills was S$120, we ordered 2 more ah bo ning (mochi dumplings) at S$4each. #1 ter kar tan (pig trotter jelly) always good here.#2 hae chor good too, very crisp.#3 cold was sweet, among the better ones.#4 the teochew braised duck was also good, flavour, tender, moist.#5 kailan with ti poh pretty ok, i guess kind of standard.#6 i ordered another spinach also S$14 (no photo).#7 seafood meesua quite ok, also standard issue.#8 the orh nee was much better than i expected, very smooth, not too sweet & nicely presented. better than ah orh which served a good orh nee too.overall, though we did not order too many dishes or expensive ones, it was quite a good lunch for 5pax at only S$121nett & we took back a new voucher booklet include another S$60 voucher for chui huay lim. not bad la! see my full reviews & photos at http://chefquak.com/2014/06/27/good-value-lunch-with-amex-vouchers-chui-huay-lim-on-25jun2014

Been here thrice and good standard maintained. The restaurant is operated by Jumbo, the same F&B establishment that tourist raved about as they indulged in chilli crab with baby apron around their neck by the river in boat quay. Reservation is strongly advised to avoid unnecessary hassle when you walk in (even though the place always seemed to have a few empty table during my visits there). More importantly, apply for the Jumbo rewards card because prices are on the high end, so 10% discount for $20 (2 year membership) will easily offset a meal for 4 pax and above. Average price per head is $30 and above without GST. DISHES recommended: - chilli crab with deep fried buns (aka man tou)- steamed promfet- salted egg yolk prawn- braised duck- pork jelly- pig trotters- sugar coated deep fried yam ( something different than conventional yam paste)Service wise- I guess I was lucky than other reviewers with no hiccups of any sort in my three visits there. Guess like all popular eatery, servers are overwhelmed during rush hours. Another interesting thing - they gave out ziplock bags to put your phones inside. Guess they had a fair share of complaints of serving customers' phones with tea instead

I enjoyed dining here with a large group during a business dinner. The food was very tasty and the service excellent. I did not pay the bill, so no idea on the cost. The outside of the building indicates some kind of club, but says "public welcome". We were there on a Friday night and it was 100% packed. We had a private room so it was easy for us, but it looked very busy. I was pleased with the meal and the friendly staff

Great authentic teochew cuisine, prepared with the freshest ingredients, cook to perfection with minimum add-ons, maintaining the original fresh flavour of the dish. The cold-crab was cooked and chilled to capture the fresh taste of the crab, you even 'feel the sea' it came from. The lobster was lightly stir-fried with wholesome garlic, was very savoury without the strong pungent garlic smell.The service staff were very attentive and friendly, always ready to lend their hands

It was a family occasion, and the well-travelled Uncle Leon* suggested this Chui Huay Lim Teochew restaurant which is home to authentic Teochew dishes, set in a cosy and classy ambience at 190 Keng Lee Road #01-02 Chui Huay Lim Club, Singapore 308409 (Tel: 6732 3637).All of us liked the ancient-looking tiled green roof and pillared entryway outside, and the modern glossyness that hit us once we were inside. The restaurant itself was set in classic and tasteful designs of Chinese (Teochew, specifically) arts and interior decor. We sat down to chat and await our feast to begin.Back to the meats, this time red one! The Braised Duck with Tofu beneath was a surprise for me as it was the first time I was having Teochew food. The tender, perfectly-braised duck pleased the tastebuds, as did the soft, silky smooth braised beancurd underneath it, still reeling with the juicy tastiness of dark sauce.Another round of mixed vegetables, the Conpoy Vegetables Dish complete with cabbage, black fungus, carrots, mushrooms and scallops was a mixed blend of palatable crunchy nutrients. It reminds me of our Cantonese Peng-Cai.After another round of vegetables we are back to the meat - Pu Ning Chicken - braised chicken with fermented Puning bean paste / sauce. The milky-soft chicken flesh was so smooth and fine. The Puning bean paste added a hint of sweet-and-salty flavor, delicious!For more detailed information and photos, please pop by:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/lunch-at-chui-huay-lim-teochew-cuisine.htm

Very good steamed pomfret but kind of pricey though. Recommend to try liver ngohhiang, braised duck (goose quite tough). Cold crab is great.
4
Not bad actually, though it was very full on February the 27th... Service is 4* along with others. Food was great but I bet even a Kuala Lumpur street food Bak kut Teh could par that

This Jumbo Chain restaurant offers unique authentic teochew dishes at a very reasonable price - especially the deep fried Yam Stick dessert - not on the menu anywhere else (in Singapore or anywhere else) that I know.The other more traditional Teo Chew dishes are excellent also. Classical dishes like the cold crab, and the duck (or goose when you can get it) are excellent - paired with great sauces.You need to make a reservation - whatever day of the week.Only problem is the noise. The tables are packed too closely, and it is difficult to have any real conversation

We celebrated a family relative's 86 year old birthday in this restaurant. The family relative hosted 4 tables. There were a lot of food on the set menu. The room was well catered with big screen tv, with karaoke sound input, for people who like to sing. The family relative probably knows the restaurant very well, so it was very lively during the singing of the birthday song, as almost all of them joined in. The suckling pig came in the wrong order though. :

There are quite a few restaurants in Singapore serving Teochew cuisine. (Though TEOCHEW is part of GUANGZHOU, both the Teochew dialect and cuisine are closer to FUZIAN than Guangzhou.) Chui Huay Lim Teochew Restaurant is a restaurant opening to the public in recent years, after it being bonded by the JUMBO GROUP. The restaurant serves mainly Teochew cuisine: goose braised in soy sauce, fish steamed in light sauce, deep fried meat rolls, porridge, etc. The quality of food is good, as are the skill of the chefs. It even outshines some of the early famed Teochew restaurants in Singapore. The staff are very attentive, giving good service. The restaurant is packed over weekend. In that they have two sittings: 1800 hour and 2000hour! The ambience is good. The price is at par with most five star level of restaurants in Singapore. Location is quite central, near the infamous "NEWTON HAWKER CENTRE". BOND APPETITE

We were invited there by a Singaporean friend who ordered everything for us, so I don't know the name of the plates we had. There was a succulent oyster omelet, a so-so cold crab, fantastic smoked noodles, a rather bland vegetable platter, very good fish balls and very tasty dessert.Overall a very good meal in a typical chinese ambiance, where we were the only foreigners there, which is an excellent sign....The service was Ok but a little slow (especially the 15 minutes to get the bill

the place does a roaring business and weekends dinner is either at 6pm or 8pm. reservations is recommended to get a table.food is above average and the hae cho is nice. other notable dishes include the braised goose as many places in Singapore use duck instead. the cold crab is also nice.one of my fav teochew restaurant besides huat kee

Went there for dinner with my family and in-laws.Had the following- Cold crab, nice with roe. Meat was sweet but felt the roe a bit overcooked.- Braised goose. Beancurd and sauce was nice, but goose was a bit overcooked again- Some braised or stewed chicken dish (my wife ordered it). Not too bad- French bean with minced pork. No big deal, should not have ordered Szechuan dish in Teochew restaurant- Egg fried rice. This was nicely done- Fried kway teow with kai lan. Classic Teochew dish. Very nice but oily (other restaurants seem to do it this way too, so must be the Teochew way)Would I go back again? Maybe once in a while. Prefer Lee Kui

My mom's friend invited her to this restaurant for lunch a couple of months back. We invited friends from Hong Kong to dine in this restaurant for lunch yesterday.  My mom ordered the set menu. There were a lot of varieties of food on it- the teochew crab, the teochew shark's fin, the fish, the small abalone with brussel sprouts, the stewed goose (which you can hardly tell the difference between it or the duck), the vegetables, the rice and the dessert. I am allergic to seafood, so my mom changed 2 of the seafood dishes to non seafood.  The only disappointment I had was that I only realised my mistake that I had to pre-order the complimentary birthday cake for my mom 4 days before (I only found out the mistake the night before), and we can only pick up the cake if we dine in the restaurant. This is the only inconvenience that I would complain of.  The service was not too bad. We were given a 2013 Calendar, in which there is a 50% voucher for every month that we can use, and was asked to enter into our details into an iPad as we left the restaurant, so as to be entered into a lucky draw for a car for the end of the month or a 40 inch television.  My mom got the Jumbo Boat rewards card, and so was given 10% discount. Our lunch yesterday was close to $450 Singapore dollars, for 5 people.  The set menu was for 6 people, and so there was an extra portion of food to be shared among the 5 of us
