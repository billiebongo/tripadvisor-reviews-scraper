Very welcoming staff and relaxing atmosphere at the end of a busy day or to just drop in during the afternoon.

Popped by for lunch. Had Quesadillas and wagyu burger. The food was ok, but seems the prices displayed might be outdated and does not match those in the menu. Might need to update their display prices!

There was live music with a singer taking request. She was very interactive with the crowd on Saturday evening. The drinks were served quickly. Around the corner from the stage there was a little cubby hole where you could relax.

Recently went to try their tea selection which was worth $36 for 2 people. Unlike most hotels which offer refillable service, the food items in the tower are just for one round. Not that we wanted to have more as none of it were remarkable and we honestly felt like it was simply a combination of reject items from the buffet table.

My wife and I are staying at the Hotel which houses this Bar.Our first day today on a short trip to Singapore and we had pre lunch drinks in a casual and relaxed setting. The Bar is in the Lobby and lends itself to people watching if one is so inclined. You can also hold business meetings or work alone here - comfortable seating with tables.They offer a decent range of bar snacks and meals, and a pretty good beverage list also. We have not tried the food yet but may do so before leaving town
