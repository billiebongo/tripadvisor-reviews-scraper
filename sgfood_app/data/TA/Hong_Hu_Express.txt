This is a gem hidden away in Fortune Centre, a small commercial/retail building right next to the famous Kuan Imm Thong Hood Cho temple & Sri Krishnan Temple. There's many vegetarian options in this building, which serve the temple devotees. Parking may be available at the small public car park opposite. Went for a quick lunch at 130pm on a week day. Some seats empty only. It's a stall run by only two staff usually. There's usually a queue where you place your orders and the staff cook it on the spot. When they are cooking you should make payment. We waited about 15 minutes. There's a wide variety of la mian (Chinese noodles) and the menu on the board provides the prices. Most are priced reasonably at $4-4.50. You can order the fried (guo tie/gyoza) for $6/9, or soup dumplings for slightly less. The large dumplings are pan fried on the spot and really worth it- crispy, lots of fillings and added with a bit of sliced ginger dipped in vinegar. Good and cheap meal in the fringe of central business district
