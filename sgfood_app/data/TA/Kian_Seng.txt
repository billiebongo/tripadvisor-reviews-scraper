This is the dish that I believe can only found in Singapore. One of the typical Singapore comfort food. Still done and cooked by Singaporeans. Very economical!

Expect to see snaking long queues at this store during the lunch hour. Food is decently priced and the portion sizing is generous! The lot mee comes with rich gravy with loads of flavour

This store is famous among locals and just moved here some months ago. I knew it when my colleague offered, but not really impressed. However, since it is my near to my house now, the store comes our family 's favourite breakfast since it has Prawn Noodle/Lor Mee and Laksa. My kid can it all. The price is 2.5 and $3. I usually order $3 since the portion at that price is still small to me. Do keep in mind the queue is long some times, so make plan in advance

A family member recommended this stall when i was at Clementi Central one weekend. The queue was about 20 people deep. It was one of the longest queue in the whole hawker centre. I don't think so many people would be wrong about their food choice, and I joined the queue.It took 20 minutes for me to get to the head of the queue. I ordered the $2.50 version with extra ingredients for $0.50 more. As they also sell prawn noodles, I ordered the yellow noodles with thick white vermicelli. it was a good combination, as most places only have think vermicelli (bee hoon). You can add diced garlic and vinegar to your own taste just before taking the bowl away from the stall. Do ask for pork lard (which was my first time), as it adds a nice flavor to the noodles. The gravy is not thick and coats the noodle sufficiently. There was fish cake, braised pork belly and 'yam balls' which is deep fried balls of yam. You can get 6 pieces of yam balls for an extra $1. The yam balls were nice. No regrets queuing 20 minutes for the noodles. Good value for money
