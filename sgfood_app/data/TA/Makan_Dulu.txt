We liked the charcoal grilled sotong, chicken curry and ginger rice. Prices are reasonable. Good service snd comfortable dining area. Will definitrly visit again. The popiah, in my view, was a letdown though.

Authentic Sundanese food served here, so good that I've gone 3 times. Favourite dish by far is the Charcoal Grilled Sotong, barbequed with a lovely sweetness yet with a strong aroma, and no fishy smell to the squid whatsoever. The beef Rendang is also cooked to perfection in terms of texture, as it is not slow cooked to the extent where it has turned rubbery. Also not overly spicy, it is definitely tolerable. The Sambal eggplant is also to die-for, so definitely don't miss it. To top off the entire meal, one definitely cannot miss a cup of Avocado Milk. There is a choice to have it with Chocolate or Coffee, both are equally heavenly
