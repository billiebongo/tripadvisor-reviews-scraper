Came in here for a quick beer this evening. Asahi on tap (including Asahi Dark) for $14++ for a pint. Service was friendly and the beer was good. Food menu looked decent too. Might be worth another visit.

we had dinner. Food was very good, nice choice. Same for the wine: very nice list full of good wines. Very pleasant service. Will definitely go back next time I fly to Singapore!

Had the most wonderful dinner today at 31! Starting with some St Marcellin, Trio Rilletes and a gorgeous Octopus Carpaccio. Followed by a perfectly roasted lamb rack from NZ and a tender OP rib. Desserts on their way!!

lovely evening with delicious dinner and good service. The portion is big enough to share and great selection of wine. Great value for money. Just fantastic!
5
Really nice and delicious place for good French delicacies. Tried the Beef Bourguignon and the Mussels. Really good and tender. Must return again.
5
This is the second time we come here for dinner and wines. Wines here are excellent and the food is awesome. We have so far tried the beef, the truffle fries, the squid, the duck, and tiramisu. And we like them all. Ambience is cozy and you literally feel your relationship with friends growing while drinking and eating here at Bar 31
5
I come here for the charismatic bartender and the lovely French-inspired food. The portions are great for sharing and I highly recommend trying everything on the menu because great care is taken with each plate. I love the baked St Marcelin cheese but that's usually seasonal - if they have it, get it! Great atmosphere, easily accessible by public transport (closest MRT is Outram Park, Exit H - 5 mins by foot).

Having worked in the Keong Saik area for a few years, with its ever changing restaurants, it is always nice to head into Bar 31 & Kitchen where you know you can guarantee a good pint and excellent food.Great location to take clients for the less informal dinners and it is just a pity that one of the owners Andre has relocated to Bangkok as he did make the it an even better spot
5
I wrote reviews before on this nice place and I write again, because I am very pleased that amids strong competition in this Keong Saik area, 31 Bar & Kitchen remains a place to be.Service and ever accommodating staff is a real plus. There are many regular customers. Their choice of drinks and food is not overwhelming but nice for any occasion. Whether more tappa's like food or a full meal: everything goes and it is good.And even later at night this place is nice to have a drink too
5
We often stop by 31 Bar & Kitchen on the way home on a Friday night. A great place to kick off the weekend with a drink. We've had the pleasure of having dinner a couple of times too, and food is very good. Ambiance is laid back and nice. Faizal and Sophia are attentive and friendly -- you will be well looked after!Definitely recommend

Everything was excellent... Wine, service, burrata, saint-marcellin, iberico pork...! Great atmosphere and a great evening !
5
Excellent service from both the owner and the staff. Extremely tasty tuna tartare and grilled squid. Overall, a wonderful place to spend an evening with food and drink.

Had a fantastic experience here, the food was delicious (loved the rib eye) and the wines were great. The managers and staff were brilliant, it was like being welcomed into their home. I can't wait to go back!
5
Have had many a fine night . Good food & excellent service , plus many a good laugh with Andre & Zal . All the best & see you on our next visit . Chad & Annie

Really nice little place for casual dining. Good service good food. There is a choice for smaller dishes to share. Similar like tapas. It is definitely a nice place for after work unwinding and meeting up with friends. The tables outside for al-fresco are nicer as you are part of the Keong Saik entertainment life, but that's up to what you like.The manager is a top guy and he understands what his customers want and who also speaks fluently french. Really no complaints here!

Sort of a "hole in the wall" looking place but a thoroughly enjoyable evening. Attentive service and spot on recommendations. The goat cheese and spinach tart was a great beginning and our entrees were fabulous (snapper and mussels). It's our favorite restaurant so far on our trip. Check it out

Located just off the beaten tracks for visitors to the tropical county in China Town. Diving right into my review:Pros:- Excellent service with good attentiveness to all customers as far as I can see- Decent wine list for a what can be considered a hole in the wall, which in my opinion is a breath of fresh air compared to the typical French restaurant- Quail was done well in my opinion, though some may not like the strong flavorCons:- Unfortunately the boeuf (beef) bourguignon was a little disappointing. Beef was tender enough, but the rich wine infused sauce was missing.- Finding the place may take a while, unless you are taking a cab or have google map on your phoneSummary:A great place for a nice France meal without having to worry about dress code and other such nonsense. Decent prices for food, but relatively pricey for the wine
5
Awesome food and great, very attentive authentic service. I ordered the Wagyu tartine, smoked eel tartine, truffled fries, duck platter and melted cheese platter. A little too much to eat for 2, I wish I'd had room for dessert! The service was very friendly, it's a cozy place. Definitely a repeat restaurant

We came across this bar late one afternoon and wanting to have a quiet drink before dinner. The staff and owner were very friendly and the cocktails made with top shelf spirits. Some fried anchovies appeared on our table which were complimentary and very yummy.What really stood out was what happened when we went back again after dinner the next night. We were welcomed like good friends and after finding out that we had already had dinner a complimentary Tiramisu arrived ... The Best I have ever eaten.We loved this place so much we went back again the next night which was our last night in Singapore and sampled some of the suburb wines on offer. Many thanks to Andre and his team for their wonderful hospitality. Will definitely be back if we are in Singapore again
5
We love Chinatown, especially Keong saik road...And, last week we tried 31 bar and Kitchen , we were amazed to find wines such as Francois Chidaine, Tardieu Laurent, Denis Mortet... Some of the best French Organic wines offered at affordable prices !!!! Food was simple but exellent and the staff was so friendly !!!
5
I love this new spot on keong saik. The staff is friendly, the place is relaxed and low key and the owner is always around to answer wine questions.
Wonderful new bar to decompress after office hours.
5
The best cerviche marinade I have ever tasted. Still dreaming of the burrata with sea salt and olive oil. Great with the bread. Superb wine selection. The Le Fleurie was tops. High quality, flavorful food in a laid back industrial contemporary setting.
4
Located conveniently, which almost everything in Singapore is. You can get a great drink or a reasonably priced meal from this establishment, and enjoy impeccable service while you're at it. Highly recommended

The steaks are good, flavours were excellent and well presented . The steak was cooked correctly (as mentioned in other reviews this can sometimes be a problem ) . Service was slow. Good place to go and sit outside and sip an evening cocktail.
5
Had the duck breast, that was made to pink perfection. Wine match very good. Crème brûlée was also exellent. The espresso was a little blend compared to the rest. The waiter showed me the wine room after the meal. A very nice selection.
5
One of the latest addition to the busy neighborhood of Keong Saik rd. Don't be mistaken this is not a French restaurant. Their concept is more of a wine bar specialized in hard-to-find drinks. They also serve food, limited selection but high quality.Talk to the owners, they come from wine and spirit trading industry and do know their business. They'll be happy to tell you the story of every bottle in their bar!Will definitely return.

I brought a group of 16 people to dinner here last night and it was great. The food was delicious, we tried just about everything on the menu and I think the favorite was the rib eye. The foie gras and cerviche were very good small plates. Service was excellent especially considering the size of the group
5
For the first time i found a bar where i can get very exclusive wine and the CHAMPAGNE is AMAZING! The prices are very reasonable for the quality that we got. What is even more interesting is that the food is of excellent quality and the service is impeccable! A much needed addition in the keong saik district i love so much. Authentic, unpretentious and welcoming
4
The night that I went, the bar had been open all of 4 days. So perhaps understandably, it was rather quiet, which suited me just fine. I must say, for such a new place, they had their act together. Service was efficient and since this IS Singapore, the drinks are actually REASONABLY priced. My girlfriend & I started with a bottle of champagne & then polished off a bottle of red after that. To go with the drinks, we had a few items off the menu (more on that in a bit). Total bill cost us $150 EACH. And that's including TWO bottles including a champagne. Almost unbelievable, considering that the neighboring bars charge about $25 for 1 cocktail. Aside from that, & the food is unpretentious & yummy. We had foie gras on toast, onglet skewers, a portion of duck rillet and deep-fried chicken served with paprika mayo. Granted, the portions border on being small, but then, all of the items are about $10-12 per serving. Can't complain especially since everything was good! Really great place to hang out. The wine list is fantastic (has a range to suit all budgets) & there's Asahi on tap. We were also told that the mojitos are pretty awesome. Too bad I couldn't try it then. Next time.....

My partner and I ordered the rib-eye (for 2 px). They came looking luscious and correctly cooked as we asked (rare). The meat was warm and pink as they should. It came with a bowl of salad and herbed potatoes (not greasy). So far, those were the best cooked meat I ate in a loooongest time. Our appetizer was a plate charcuterie...perfect opening. The sommelier's recommendation was very good. Over all, we'll be coming back for sure and will recommend this for my family and friends from Indonesia

I have been there a couple of times with my gfs.
It's a cozy and friendly place.
Food is great, especially the desert!! Love the Apple Crisp!
Great service too!
Definitely worth going back again!

Located in the new 'trendy' Jiak Chuan / Keong Saik triangle this is a great little restaurant. Food, wine and service were all excellent. Recommended.

The evening we dined here in Sept was a nice enough place...... but frankly was total dismay how poor the food was.... the amazing thing, other reviewers had suggested the lamb was a hot dish at this establishment.... so naturally we went for the lamb as recommended by the server..... amazing it was all fat, grizzle and disgusting...... but more amazing.... one would think the owner server or manager or whoever he was would ask how is your meal.... the place was about 2/3rds full on a Saturday nite.... a nite one always thinks as a big nite for good restaurants..... no never asked how we were getting along or what we thought of our food, standard procedure for a restaurant of this supposed caliber....maybe he anticipated what we would say and decided better not to ask.... the red wine was okay but at S$125.00/bottle it was not so satisfying..........overall, will never return, but the one redeeming feature it will remain fodder for remember how bad discussions amongst our group for years to come....

I wish I could write a better review, as the food was good and the sommelier recommended some good wine. The restaurant is simple but nice and could be an ideal place for a relaxed dinner. However, the overall experience was quite average because of the following reasons: a) the young waitress was unfriendly and not very interested/active; b) the owner, cooking in front of us, did not do any effort to establish contact with us and looked "bored"; only when I addressed her in French after our meal, she did reply something. This did not create a warm atmosphere; on the contrary, I didn't feel very welcome..

We came for my boyfriend's birthday for the first time and we had a great experience ! The food was delicious. The chef is cooking in front of you which is nice and she gives you good advice on what to eat. They had a special attention for the birthday boy for desert ! I will go back for sure

Having been in Singapore for many years I am always looking to try new places.Dined here on 21 Sep with three friends ( one a visiting restaurateur from Hong Kong). We had the large lamb rack ($80) to share. It was a long time since it had been a lamb and it was just fat and bone.None of us has ever had a worse piece of meat. We declined to order more food, albeit we were still hungry. I have crossed this restaurant off my list
5
It seems crazy to think that you'll eat outstanding French food in a tiny restaurant tucked away on the edge of Chinatown in Singapore but there it is. The menu a tempting array of ' I love that' moments. We asked if we could have share platters and the staff were willing to oblige. A lovely mix of dishes including some beautiful vegetarian options. I was delighted to see Vitello Tonnato - a favourite not often seen on menus. Great wine list, attentive, interested service. I wish this was nearer

So we had some friends returning to Singapore for a long weekend and let them choose the venue and somehow they came up with this place. I had seen it before when eating at another place in Keong Saik but promptly forgot about it.It struck me as a bit spartan inside and wasn't particularly to my taste but I'm not exactly a designer guy so I switched my attention to the menu. It was fairly small, but I took that as a good sign, it is a small restaurant so a huge, wide ranging menu would have alarmed me.Male friend and I were in a carniverous frame of mind and opted out of starters, but the ladies, being more elegant than us did go for them, an aubergine concoction and a tomato salad which were certainly very prettily presented and pronounced very good.They then went for the lamb rack to share. We aforesaid carnivores were torn between the lamb and the cote de beouf, which when available is our default position. In the end we made the only sensible choice: one of each.More choices to make, this time from the wine list and it had a good selection, and some very reasonable prices to boot. I ordered a Touraine Sauvignon Blanc and a Vacqueyras, both under $100 which I felt a bargain. The Touraine was excellent, and made a great aperitif, while the Vac was good and full and it stood up well to the meat.And what meat: perfectly cooked and of the highest quality. There were some sides but I didn't really take much notice of them to be honest.This is a definite return visit needed place

Max and I had already checked out special Singapore dining options for a birthday occasion before travelling.Top floor, top view, top dollar? Don't think so.We eventually looked for something genuinely French...and found it in Provence Le Restaurant. If there's an award for the 'perfect little restaurant'...this is it. We had a great evening. Thanks to Julienne & Fabrice and the owner (Andre?) who shared a glass of red outdoors with us later in the evening.Next to Chinatown, where we ate most of the time, this restaurant is perfectly situated next to Outram and in an interesting locale. Many bars, galleries, eateries etc.The charcuterie platter opened proceedings. And it's enough for two...saucisson, rillette, chorizo and terrines plus little extras. Delicious.For mains I opted for the beef cheek and this was exceptional...rich and tender, perfectly cooked.Max had the fish of the day...she couldn't stop smiling!Fabrice, the sommelier, was attentive without being intrusive...excellent service.Bon appetite indeed

Went to a wine tasting degustation dinner, second time at this gem of a restaurant! Paired wines with every dish, and an enjoyable evening with my spouse. The staff and owners remembered us, and whether by design or coincidence we had the same table as our first visit; a nice touch. Will be going there again, as their menu is refreshingly innovative and interesting. " Provence with a twist "
