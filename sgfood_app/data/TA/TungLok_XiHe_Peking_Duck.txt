Food was delicious, especially the Peking Duck. Service was just ok because it was Chinese New Year week, the restaurant was packed so the servers were unable to be as prompt as normal.
3
Had CNY set meal, disappointing. Dessert was serve before the rice, so ridiculous. Super oily duck and very normal food. Waste of money. Had high expectations since the other Tung Loks are really good.
5
Amazing Peking duck and equally great side dishes to complement - making it a thoroughly enjoyable meal!
4
As always, TungLok XiHe delivers. Great succulent Peking duck and equally good side dishes to complement - making it a thoroughly enjoyable meal!
5
I'm a regular because the food is simply awesome here. The Peking duck makes you reminisce of the real deal in Beijing. Other dishes are very well done too. Service staff are all very friendly !
4
It would have been 5 stars for the food and especially the service. The building air condition was not working properly and they went out of their way to bring in a portable one.We had 2 tables for Chinese New Year celebration and requested frequently for additional condiments, which they served with a smile.Unfortunately, the layout of the restaurant was cramped making it a little uncomfortable
4
You don’t come here without having the duck - it’s pointlessIn fact, we hardly bothered with the additional dishes that were orderedThe skin is crispy, the meat was nice and juicyService all night was efficient and friendly and they made sure the kids were taking care of to
5
Service was really good. The staff hosted us well, introducing their menu and promotions to us. We ordered a whole peking duck and other usual dishes. The Peking duck was sliced very skillfully with an impressive showmanship and plating. The duck skin had a unique crisp and smokiness to it which went well with the condiments. We wanted to be adventurous and went for the rest of the duck parts to be cooked in Cereal style. Tasted good but the cereal did not compliment the duck meat well. Will definitely revisit again
5
3rd time for our family. Always on the look out for special offers. This time brought a friend from Brazil. She said this is duck divino - divine duck as to the taste & texture! We enjoyed the time & meal together. Thanks to Chope & to TungLok XiHe Peking Duck. Will be on the look out for special offers to come back agai
5
I have good experience to share on this restaurant! Great follow up with my reservations from the phone till 2 days before my reservation. Had a great and responsive waiter, David, who helped us take photo and explain how to enjoy their peking duck. Kindly share this compliments with him! Also to the lady who was trying to assist with the promoting of their membership which I could not take on as I already bought Chope Vouchers
5
First time at this restaurant the food is good and great service! Although restaurant seems to run shortage of staff however staffs and captains are attentive to quick attend to request of service.
5
Peking duck is a must try! Whole duck portion just nice for 6-7 adult
Excellent service and nice dinning ambience
4
The expected quality for a restaurant in this class. Once of the better Peking ducks we've had. Quick, polite.
5
Always my favorite place for Peking Duck. Reservation was made easy with CHOPE & the staff from TUngLok XiHe went the extra mile to call to confirm the reservation again. It will not go wrong with Tung Lok. :)
4
Nice restaurant, good food with good customer service. We went there because of their signature Peking duck, I like it a lot.
3
The restaurent seems very busy because lots of people celebrated end of the year. The food was not that bad but the services was quite slow. I'm willing to visit next time.
5
The peking duck at TungLok is very authentic, cooked and presented in the same style as what you will find in Beijing. The Irish duck they use is very flavourful, moist, and has a great fat content too. The waitstaff are also very polite, and they don't rush you out of the restaurant when you are finished. The peking duck set is enough to feed 2 people (3 if not very hungry). They often run promotions for half price so keep an eye out on their IG for that. Honestly though, I would pay the full price for the peking duck, as it really is worth it (I think it was $66++).
4
The food took quite a long time to arrive, because they timed all the dishes with the arrival of the famous peking duck. We had dim sum which were delicious, and the shrimp dumpling soup. The fried dumplings are recommended !The duck itself is cut by the chef and you receive bite sized pieces, which then you can either wrap or dip it in the accompanying sauces. All in all, the service was helpful and timely. Atmosphere was quiet and good. Would come again
5
It’s my first time at this restaurant and I am greatly impressed by this Chinese restaurant. The staff were attentive and service was great. The waiter who served us gave us good advice on food choices and he wasn’t pushy about it. We had a wonderful time there.
4
It's very special, there are different ways of eating the Peking Duck. But the serving have more meat less skin compare to the usual Peking Duck I use to eat which has more skin. Duck price is reasonable. Other dishes were fine but don't have that special feel. The Peking Duck is a must have. Atmosphere is great for gathering
5
we went with friends to enjoy the great peking duck and vegetables. Worth every penny and very tasty!
4
Interesting twist to how the peking duck is being served. The sauces are refreshing and go very well with the duck. Reasonably priced too!
5
Great decor. Good service & excellent food. The Peking duck is really good.The prawns fried with salted duck egg yolk was also very good.If u are in Singapore, give this place a try. well worth a visit.
5
The food served here is really nice and the service is also good. Great place to have good peking duck.
4
got 50dollar birthday voucher.
but after use this voucher they not allow us to use wechat pay or fave pay:(
4
Food was not bad albeit a bit oily. The service could do better. Wouldn’t pay full price for the food though. Used a voucher for it.
3
We had our friends gathering event in this restaurant last week. My friends didnt really like the Peking Duck. Other dishes they also found so so...
4
Due to a previous experience, i was a little skeptical about this visit. The food this time did not disappoint. The duck was succulent and delicious. The other dishes in the set menu did not disappoint as well. The melt in the mouth sea cucumber was unforgettable. Looking forward to our next visit
5
Came specifically for the duck, which was excellent. Crisp skin, succulent meat- nice pink and moist unlike some places that serve dried out duck meat. Only criticism is perhaps a larger portion of the blueberry sauce could be provided as it tastes so very special. A bit disappointed with the salted egg crab though, but I guess one cannot expect too much as they have a speciaslist seafood restaurant 4 floors up and if one wanted seafood, probably better to have gone 4 floors up. Still, thoroughly enjoyed the superb duck
3
We went for the 50%-off discounted Peking duck. Made a reservation at 8pm with a Peking duck, which was confirmed again on the morning of the visit. I took the 8pm slot just because all the previous slots were already taken, but because we ain't hungry.However, when we arrived at 7:50pm, we were told that we need to wait cos the 8pm table has not been cleared yet. Ok, that's fine. But we waited till 815-820 to get our seats, when we already feel like starving. Although we have pre-ordered the duck, the duck only arrives at 0925pm............which we feel really unreasonable. The stuffs are friendly though.While the duck is overall nice, the late-eating caused me to actually vomit at midnight......................Very disappointed with the time/pre-order management.Atmosphere a bit noisy
4
The Signature Peking Duck was a good staple for such an establishment, with the meat being tender yet full-flavoured. Other notable dishes that are worth trying include the mapo tofu and stir fried king beans with clams!
5
Loved their peking duck & it is a must-have esp when it is on promotion! I had it twice haha! Awesome food & service as always.
4
Yummy Peking duck at promotion price of $33++ and excellent service! Was served by a very knowledgeable manager who teaches us the different parts of meat and how to eat them, and she’s also very attentive and made sure we had an enjoyable meal.
5
Excellent food and service. Staff did not asked us to leave even though it was beyond lunch time. Service was staff was good as well.
4
Peking duck was good! You need to order the duck in advance as it takes an hour for preparation. Scallops are fresh and tasty. Service was excellent. However, food is a little pricey.
3
Food taste is average, but don't feel good when comes to the serving on the Peking Duck, they served the 1st portion in front of us but brought the rest back to the kitchen , by looking at it there're still lots of meat on it but when it serve to us later, they'll all bear bones ONLY??? Service is polite but give you a unfriendly feeling, the way they speak? the way they act
4
Came here on the Peking duck 50% promotion. Meat was tender and the skin crispy. Duck was a bit fatty though, i.e. Lots of fat. The blueberry sauce was great too, a refreshing taste from the normal sauce. On the whole, great taste and value for money!We opted to pack away the what's left of the duck after de-skinning. However, what irks me every time (not just Tung Lok. Imperial Treasures does it as well) is that they DID NOT (and DO NOT) give you what's left of the duck served to you. They simply picked whatever that they have in the kitchen and pack it into a takeaway plastic box. How did I know? Because I looked at the de-skinning process and looked at how much was left of the duck. What's packed in the takeaway box is definitely lesser than what's left of the duck served to me. And my box has 4 drumsticks (not much meat left though). How could there be 4 drumsticks if they were honest to give me the balance of the duck served to me? This seems to be the unspoken practice in all the Peking duck restaurants
3
We came for the Peking duck. There was a promo on-going. It’s not bad. It’s the fatty style which some say it’s authentic Peking Style. Those who enjoy more crispy type may not enjoy it. The roasted duck portion was sufficient but the crepe wrappers weren’t enough. We enjoyed the promo of 50% for Peking duck. Usual price was $66. The second eating of the duck bones costs $12. You can choose from 4 styles. My brother chose salt & pepper fried style and he said it’s enjoyable. I just like duck skin & breast meat. It was not dry. Quite good. Drinks of tea for free flow $5++ per pax was toooo expensive. Seriously. We ordered soup instead. $28 for the broth with crab & rice. Can’t really see much crab...Dim sum was $4.20? Each basket. Nothing fantastic. Don’t bother. The liusha bao never “liu” (flow). The seafood fried mee sua $18 was not bad. The fish puff noodle soup $10 was not bad. Overall was ok. For this price $200+ before discount, for 6 people, not exactly cheap. Service was just ok. I mean for this price, you can serve free water or tea. It’s quite ridiculous. If people order food, serve minimum water for free! Would I be back? I’m not sure. Only if there’s 50% off for Peking duck again, maybe..
5
The Peking duck is very flavourful, especially when eaten with the various sauce like blueberry sauce and plum sauce! And for the month of November, there is an ongoing promotion of 50% off ducks on weekdays/ 30% on weekends which made the dining experience even better! Other dishes like the bamboo clam and mapo tofu are very delicious too
5
One of the best Peking Duck I've ever tasted. Always call ahead to reserve a duck, especially during peak times. A great touch is that the chef will wheel the duck out on his serving trolley to your table and expertly carve it up right before your eyes. This is always a treat for tourists and friends who are visiting!Every duck is served 3 ways with explanations of which condiments to use for which cut of the duck. The popping sugar is heavenly especially if you're having it for the first time. After the chef has deftly carved up the duck, there will still be some meat left closer to the bones. This, you can have the kitchen cook for you in various styles. I like to have it served diced and wrap in leaves of lettuce. The highlight of the menu is, of course, their Peking Duck, but all the other dishes that I have tried from their menu is good too. Location - Centrally located in, well, Orchard Central. Somerset MRT station is just under the building. Lots of places for drinks, coffee and even ice-cream around the area after dinner.Service - Excellent. Extremely friendly and attentive. Do ask for clarifications on how to eat the various servings of the duck as they might take it for granted that you are an expert if you have no questions. Food - Excellent. My favourite Peking Duck place in Singapore. Atmosphere - Good chinese restaurant setting. Pleasant and not extremely noisy even during peak times. Great place to bring tourists and friends from out of town as they can witness the carving of the duck! Wait time - Call to make reservations during peak times and reserve the duck! Recommendations - Get the duck
5
Food was awesome and great with good services. we enjoyed ourselves, and will recommand my friends to try next time.
4
Had dinner with friends at the restuarant twice and ordered set meals. Nice Peking duck with interesting sauces to go with & value for money!
4
Portion of the food is a bit little but overall good service and tasty food! Service was good too! Attentive staff! Thank!
5
Excellent duck!
Moist, succulent meat contrasted by the crispiest skin. Not the typical Peking duck and never disappoints.
A pleasure to visit every time!
5
Good stuff! Came w wife n my fsmily. New job celebration. Nice place n convenient for. Made rsvp via chope
3
Wagyu beef was not as tender as turf city's...
Duck cooked 2nd way with garlic was a tad salty.
Gotta give props to the server though
5
Celebrated my birthday with friends. Service was great. Staff are attentive and go the extra mile to make our dining experience a wonderful one. Food is of high quality. Beautiful interior.
5
My sis + niece really enjoyed the duck, I would say it is considered one of the best Peking ducks especially accompanied with the special sauces. We also like the other dishes - slices of giant grouper with asparagus, organic Australian dou meow + the dessert almond cream coconut
5
This is a shop opened in 2014 after the initial launch of xihe at turf city in 2012. By the name suggest "xi" is one of the three ancient emperor in china myths and "he" meaning get together. So with dishes like Beijing duck served to the table brings joy and comfort to everyone getting together at the meal. It's very meaningful and of course Super delicious

The food was good. We had the Peking duck, had the meat cooked with ginger & spring onion, & the French beans with bacon & clams. The French beans were perfectly cooked & seasoned. The duck was very tasty, although we didn't like the blueberry sauce, & felt the mustard overpowered the duck. The duck skin was heavenly, practically melting in my mouth. The bit of sauce that came with the ginger & spring onion meat was good, but there was barely any meat on the bones. I get it, it was mostly served with the skin. I just wished they had peeled the rest of the meat off the bones before cooking it. Serving service was good. Staff was attentive. When the bill came, things changed. I had a Tung Lok voucher, given because I bought mooncakes from them. The voucher stated minimum $100 on a la carte food must be spent. Our bill was $108, $6 of that was for tea. So I handed over the voucher. The server came back & said must spend min $100 on food. We pointed out that we had. A manager came over & mumbled in Chinese that it's only food. We pointed out, that the bill, before service charge & GST, was $108. Minus the $6 tea, the bill was $102, so it meets the redemption restriction. He mumbled something, so we asked him to repeat himself. He pointed to the duck meat with ginger & spring onion, & mumbled something in Chinese again. We told him we didn't understand & he stalked off. He came back a few mins later, pointed to the duck meat dish again, & mumbled something angrily. Finally another manager came over. He spoke English & he spoke clearly. We explained the situation to him. He said only food counts towards the total to use the voucher. We pointed out the amounts. He said only food from the menu counts, no special items. We pointed out the duck meat was listed in the menu. We asked him to explain why we couldn't use the voucher. He asked us to wait, left for a bit, then came back & allowed us to use the voucher. I still don't understand why they kept telling us the meat dish doesn't count. It's obviously food & it was on the menu. My biggest grief is the first manager. He was rude. Yes, we were in a Chinese restaurant, but this is still Singapore. English is our first language. Why didn't he speak English? And more importantly, if he can't speak clearly, why is he dealing with customers???That rudeness marred our dining experience. The food wasn't good enough for me to overlook such rudeness.
5
My 2nd time here still able to find items in menu that's tasty, other than the must-have Irish duck. The asparagus is freshly good. The tomatoes are awesomely refreshing that even my nephew who just turned 1 fancy.
5
Ordered the signature Peking Duck, French bean, pork rib. Peking Duck was unique, and great tasting. Staff took the time to explain how to best eat it, and ensured our comfort.
5
Had this good deal on National Day itself.
Very pleasant experience.
Food was good and service was excellent.
Given a voucher after billing.
Will definitely go back for more.
5
Top notch duck! As good as any place in Beijing at high but very reasonable pricing. Highly recommend.
4
Went to try the star of the restaurant. The bell will dong before the Chef brings the duck to your table and slices it up. You can choose to cook the balance meat in different ways.
2
difficult place to find, not so fancy location in the middle of car park at 7th floor of shoping mall.
With exception of the Duck, food has been disappointing and far below expectation.
Staff members are pleasant and offer a warm welcome.
4
We arrived Singapore last saturday aug 19. Sunday morning aug 20 we decided to have our lunch at Tunglok xihe. We enjoyed our order immensely. We requested the bones to be cooked as cerealDuck (similar to cereal prawns!) its was quite nice. Something new to the usual minced duck in lettuce leaves.
1
I have had a lot of Peking ducks and this is one of the worst one I have had. It wasn't cheap either ! I think they tried to do too much with it and it spoil the authentic Peking duck taste. The skin was hard and wasn't very crispy. Don't understand why they put 'pop' candy instead of just white sugar for the skin. Other dishes were okay. I won't say is worth the price. The place itself is good cuz is spacious and the service staff overall is good.
3
With the word Peking Duck in its name, clearly that should be the star of the dinner. The anticipation came to nought; first serving of the duck laid out three ways, was great showmanship however the quality lackluster. Duck skin was overtly fat. The popping sugar accompaniment did nothing to save it. The thigh meat while tender (saving grace) was pretty bland. And while the presentation of the pancake-style wraps for the duck was elegant, the sauces were nothing to rave about. Other dishes of Sichuan Poached Sliced Fish, Steamed Grouper, Deep Fried Lamb, Spinach Beancurd, Mushroom with Minced Pork and Vermicelli with Seafood rounded off the meal. All of which ranged from disappointing to passable. Silver lining was the great acoustics, quiet ambience of the restaurant for decent adult conversations across the table throughout the evening. Service staff were always close by, but not imposing. Worth every cent of the 10% service charge of the bill
5
Goooood , brand name already stated Peking duck...nice place to go for . Especially when your order duck is ready..there's a gong sound before they send to you.Its like in ancient China emperor time..announcement...cool....the chef will cut the duck right in front of you...the aroma itself can makes your tummy Grow...cheerrr
4
What an amazing experince we had that night. a Customer took us there and it was amazing.
service excellent
food the peking duck experience is ...out of this world
I will really recommand it for people who want to eat GREAT peking duck
5
We were given a table by the window... very nice! My mum, a good cook, complimented on the food; this seldom happens.
5
Waitress and waiter were very attentive to our needs and refilled our tea constantly. The food was delicious
5
Perfect. We ordered some Noodles and one Peking duck. It was a family lunch. We were all very delighted and impressed with the presentation and quality of the cooking.We would definitely come back again in the next month. Look forward to another sumptuous dinner at This TungLok branch.
4
As its name suggests, peking duck is highly recommended. It comes with an interesting sauce and popping candy. Of course you can enjoy it the traditional way as well. For 2 people, the duck might be too much to finish.Other nice dishes I've tried are san bei crab which come with vermicelli and lobster noodles which was a seasonal item.Overall highly recommended
5
The signature Peking duck was delightful, choose however to have the leftover duck diced and stir fried instead of being fried with cereal. The vegetable, prawn and clam were done well. Desserts were too sweet and quite disappointing after such a good meal. Skip dessert here
2
Usually in Asian cuisine they serve complimentary appetisers. So when they gave us two very smalls bowls of a marinated vegetable we ate it thinking it was complimentary. Turns out they were 4 dollars each! When we asked why didn't they tell us it would be billed they said they didn't "out of respect". Fortunately they were willing to take it out later.Other than that food was alright, expensive but worth the price, and the customer service was decent. Just ask before eating anything you did not order
4
Nice peking duck cook in beijing peking duck style...Under this cooking method, the duck skin literally melts in mouth but the meat is slightly less tender as compared to peking duck in other restraurant. Price is reasonable at around 70 per duck, advance reservation for duck recommended if you does not want to wait for 45 mins to get your duck cook after ordering. Other dish at around 18 for vegetables and 28 for prawns 48 for soup. They have a special birthday cake decoration and singing for you if you brought your cake to celebrate your birthday. Recommend for group dinning above 4 people...if not you would have issue finishing the duck
5
This would be without doubt one of the best Asian Restaurants I have eaten. The Peking Duck is in my opinion, the best on the planet.Service is sensational and the options are amazing. You will struggle with so many options. But its worth the battle and rewards and are a culinary delight.Donâ€™t miss this one..
5
first things first, the service from our waitress was excellent. she was attentive and helpful despite an amusing language barrier. she tried her best to show us how to properly eat the peking duck and ave us excllant dish recommendations. the food was delicious and the ambiance was satisfactory. was ate her to celebrate my sisters birthday and our attendant even served the cake we bought from awfully chocolate on plates with cutlery. Awesome experience. only downside is that it was a little pricey.
5
Good service and good quality of food. Second time here and will be back for more. Ordered the duck in advance and didn't disappoint.
4
The lacking of one star was because of the inattentive service, difficult to get their atttention though once I got it, they were polite and friendly. Food is tasty, drinks slightly overpriced I feel.
5
Wonderful food, great service. The duck was as good as the one I tasted in Beijing, with even less fat!
4
food are good.just that Chope screw up my resv. they cancel it.. lucky they still have a table for us..
3
Quite expensive. Visited because we have the tung luk vouchers. The duck is not bad but the rest are average
4
Food was tasty and service was appropriate.
However the meal took relatively long as there was waiting time between each dish.
5
All is fantastic.too good to say by word. The choice is variety , the duck is very very tasty . Good to show our tourist sg food
5
Best Peking duck in town and their other dishes are equally as scrumptious. Lychee sweet and sour pork was very good as was the soupy seafood rice dish. I would recommend everyone to try this restaurant.
4
The dishes were promptly prepared upon order, the service staff also did a birthday celebratory song for the birthday guest. The only thing that fell short was the waiting time to the table; the reservation was made at 8PM at 14 May. Understand that its a special occasion and crowds are expected. We waited at least 15 minutes for our table despite arriving exactly at 8PM. The service staff on duty was also unable to explain or handle the situation
4
Once a upon a time there was a happy duck called Jack! He was from Ireland and he found his way on an aeroplane to Singapore. A mentalist & a producer decided to have a good meal. Many people recommended that Tunglok was a great place to dine... the rest is revealed in the images below...with the best Mentalist in the world
4
Not a cheap restaurant with average quality. with the same value can get better food elsewhere. overall average only
5
Still one of the best Peking duck in Singapore. My 9 year old daughter loves the pancake w the duck in sweet sauce. Will be back
3
The staff is very pushy on the pricey dishes although we have already told the staff is okie because we decided for the other dish!
4
Food is awesome as usual . However, it can get a litttle pricey without a voucher . Would suggest getting the voucher to use here
5
First time there for mom's celebration. Order peking duck, which is a must order!! Seafood ordered were really fresh and taste heavenly too!
5
the peking duck was really good with no gamey taste, skin was really crispy and goes well with the condiments provided. would definitely come back again for the duck
5
Celebrated my sister's birthday there with the family Experience was wonderful and the restaurant staff helped a lot with the celebration and the surprise cake. Had a really great experience there and the service quality was good with nice clean environment. Will certainly return to the place next time.
4
Today i gave my cousin a birthday treat at this restaurant.The manager and staff gave us a surprise by singing a cantonese birthday song for us and make my cousin v happy we also enjoy the signature Peking duck its skin is v crispy we are most satisfied with the steam soon hok fish which is fresh n tender but abit expensive.The pan fried scallop is slightly overcooked .Will definitely come back for other delicious dishes
2
It was a mistake for me and my friends to celebrate her birthday there! Poor customer service we received from the staffs,I could only recall that there was only a Chinese lady which was quite nice.I have called to make reservation to reserve a Peking duck and special arrangement for my friend's birthday,we were told by the tunglok staff if we did not order a Peking duck beforehand, tendency we would need to wait for an hour. When we arrived at the restaurant,no one was at the door to attend to us. We were like stepping in and manage to grab and verify with one of staffs - in order for us to get a seat. The male manager served our table regularly who made us uncomfortable. We requested from the male manager for our Peking duck and noodles to be served as the birthday girl was pregnant and she was starving. Though we were waiting for another 2 friends to arrive,we already stated clearly to the manager that we needed the food to be served first.The noodles was served to us within 30mins but the Peking duck came after 1.5 hour.Frankly speaking the food was not that tasty to worth the wait. In the end,they did not serve the birthday treat that my friend was supposed to be surprised with. It was just the worst dining experience for Peking duck which I adored a lot! It was the first and the last time there with my friends. If a renowned chain of restaurants is treating their customers badly and wait that long for the food(especially pregnant women),we do not think the customer service standard is good with the other restaurants under the group. My family and I were a regularly customer from tunglok Group of restaurants,we would not patronize them ever
4
Went there with my beaties for dinner.We ordered frog..yes...frog...hehehe.., Chinese dumpling / guotie & of course their signature dish, Peking duck.All are tasty & dwlicious.The staffs are very attentive, the decor are quite good.Excellent dinner experience.Will definitely come back for other delicious dishes
4
one duck 66 dollar，two people share one duck is more than enough，waitress is very polite，window view very good，but veg a bit expensive，almost 20 dollar，they also hv 1 for 1 drink，not bad.
5
Must try the blueberry sauce! The duck was fresh ... none of that gamey smell or taste. My guests were curious about the blueberry sauce and the sugar. Delicious.
5
I ordered the Peking Duck, 2 soup & 1 fried noodle which is made from fish. Enjoy my food very much. Furthermore, I enjoyed 50% discount when 2 dine using AMEX Platinum Credit Card. Otherwise, prices is pretty expensive.
3
Had their peking duck and meat was tough. Sea cucumber was not great either. Still prefer the peking duck from imperial treasure paragon. Service was great though!
5
I was impressed when the crew brought the birthday cake over to our table and sang birthday song and recite auspicious poem for my mum.
5
Went there for dinner with overseas colleagues. All were pleased and happy with the quality of food and service provided by the staff. will visit again.
4
The staff were very friendly and prompt in their service . As always, the duck was delectable :) worth a visit
5
Very awesome service and excellent quality of food. Really enjoy my time there with family. will go there again for sure
5
Have a good time for the dinner at Tung Lok XiHe PeikIng Duck. Ordered the fresh Soon Hock and cooked by the style recommended. Turn out to be the most impressive dish. Meat is very tender. Also ordered at Peiking Duck. The waitress has also taught us the correct way of eating, starting from the skin, to breast meat then the meat from the drumstick. Have used the discount from Amex, overall price still consider ok
4
Good service in the beginning that dropped towards the end. We were already done eating but 2 dishes were still not to be seen. We were told that they can't serve all dishes at once because the table can't contain but.. we were already done eating with the other dishes. Which doesn't make sense. Moreover the restaurant didn't look packed.
4
The duck is fantastic, the dumplings is the best I ever try, the sweet and sour pork is only average. The portion is too little for presentation. Look pathetic when is cut in a smaller cube. Don't look nice at all. All other dish is OK.
5
Really tasty and fantastic food. Starting with the augurale plate of CNY, we enjoyed entire duck with different sauces and vegetables .shark fin soup , abalone and sea cucumber, noodles with crayfish , sliced spicy fish ....and a wonderful mango dessert. I enjoyed the dinner and I will absolutely be back in this restaurant 
5
We had the set for 8 persons and all were totally satisfied and we could not finish our food and we had to takeaway our preserved waxed rice leftover and New Year pudding dessert.All had a taste of the waxed rice and it is simply delicious.Good size portion of lo hei, delicious duck , food served hot and the double boiled chicken soup with cordyceps was to die for with even finicky kids drinking up two bowls of the soup.We had the $398++ menu for 8 persons and were totally satisfied with the quality and quantity. Keep it up
4
Went with the whole family on a Sunday. Reservations made 2 days prior. Service is very good, with attentive wait staff attending "solely" to your table. The Peking Duck is naturally amazing, but i find the other menu items equally delicious. We ordered a set meal for 6 instead of ala carte and was very satisfied. Amusing to hear the gong goes off each time a duck is ready to be served.
1
Service here is way below average for the price of the meals. We ordered the Peking duck and we're happy to wait the 15 minutes required to roast the duck. However they took over 45 minutes to be served the duck whilst we asked multiple times. There were a few tables that arrived later then us and received their order of Peking duck before us. Will not be returning and advise potential patrons to find another place to dine
5
Organised a mid-autumn lunch for a group of friends recently at the Tunglok XiHe Peking Duck restaurant at The Grandstand.The restaurant manager Sally and her staff treated us very well. They gave us a private room with personalised decorations. The food was delicious. Every dish was faultless. The Peking duck was very tasty. Esp. the duck skin with the popping sugar! Much better than the more expensive Peking duck restaurants that I've been to. They also gave us mini slices of various mooncakes with our desserts. Tea was topped up constantly. All last-minute seating changes were accommodated efficiently. It was a 5-star experience. Most of my friends vowed to return again!

Went to dinner here with friends from work and had an amazingly delicious duck and all a the trimmings. While a bit out of the way on the 7th floor of the building, it's well worth the elevator ride. The wraps that come with the duck are a wonderful way to enjoy the meat, sauces and vegetables that came with the meal. Neat place and really good food

We enjoyed the Peking duck as the duck was served to be eaten in 4 different ways with different sauces. The remaining bones were deep fried with salt and chilli which is yummy. Other dishes were average though. Service was very good. Despite of the crowd during our visit, we had no problem getting the waiters' attention and our plates were constantly replaced with clean ones and the pot of tea was constantly refilled. A great dining experience.

This Restaurant was recommended and reserved thru a local friend, because we wanted to have amongst different things also peking Duck.it was worth the trip.besides the fact that the service has no knowledge about wines, the rest was perfect. avoid the back of the room because the aircon is really stron

There were too many restaurants and food F&B to choose when you are around Orchard Central but if you are game for Chinese Food, then go straight to TungLok Xihe Peking Duck at level 7 of Orchard Central Shopping Mall.We opted for the set meal that came with a huge bowl of Herbal Chicken, Claypoy Marble Goby, Brocolli served with Abalone and Tendon, Noodle, a whole serving of Peking Duck and finally dessert of herbal jelly served with mint gelato. All the dishes were well prepared and seasoned properly (not too sweet nor salty). The service staff was attentive and even recommended the right sauces to go with the dishes especially the Peking Duck which were cut into 3 different portions. The whole experience was heavenly and the service impeccable. Though the meal was pricey, you definitely won't be disappointed when you dine there.Thumbs up to the team behind the restaurant
