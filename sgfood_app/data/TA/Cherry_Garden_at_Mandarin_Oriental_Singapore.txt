It wasn’t the fact that in booking the table, there were some serious issues with common a very western name - in fact this can be often a good sign for authenticity. Though sadly in this case it wasn’t.It wasn’t the fact that my Singaporean colleague said the dim sum was lousy in taste and overpriced. For that alone doesn’t warrant a one star rating.It was that when asked during the telephone booking, if there were any dietary restrictions, I indicated one of our party has diabetes - to which the restaurant happily said it could accommodate. Upon arrival at the table, we were again asked about dietary restrictions. Again we indicated diabetes for one of the guest and placed the order for beef cubes a grilled scallops. 20 minutes later, the waiter returned saying in fact the beef had sugar and thus they would only be serving the scallops (breaded!) - no offer from another dish. We were obliged to go for a second lunch elsewhere after paying quite a bit for a scarcely edible lunch at the so-called five star Mandarin Oriental.It seems as such that the staff has been trained to ask about dietary restrictions but are completely incapable of dealing with answers in the affirmative.Truly one of the most dreadful eating experiences on the island..

We were 2 couples our friends were celebrating their wedding anniversary. I only advised the staff as we entered but yet they still manage to organise a beautiful cake. The entry into the restaurant with the wooden doorway is lovely all wonderfully decorated with teal wood. Lovely decorated round tables and lots of space. The cuisine is Cantonese and so much choice from the menu. We decided to share so picked different starters and main courses. Plenty of wine choices but there was a good offer on NZ Sauvignon blanc which was lovely. They offer you a small complimentary bite and it was a lovely lightly fried cod. Starters of wok fried soft shell crab and the meat platter of duck and pork were delicious. The mains of scallops, pan fried beef, chicken with mango and noodles and veg all so tasty. In fact everything was delicious. They then came out with a beautiful red velvet cake with happy anniversary. Service was excellent can’t be faulted, food delicious and really made it special.

Price is very reasonable for the taste and portion sizes of the food here. We were here for my dad's birthday, and the staff were very welcoming, friendly, and accommodating to our needs. Ambience was lovely too. The fried rice and recommended desserts (something with avocado, I think) were amazing! Give the fried mantou with chilli crab sauce a pass though, and save your appetite for the other dishes
5
Nice decor, food is good, service is great, adequate portion sizes.My only issue is - tables are too close to each other ie. lack of privacy.There are private rooms you can take however they are very expensive per person. If the price was lowered slightly by 15%-20% and to perhaps reduce 1-2 tables to allow for increase spacing I would frequent this place daily! lastly - for a restaurant like this they are very stingy on giving parking coupons minimum spend of 150$ / parking coupon fyi

If you are planning a Chinese Dinner, look no further than by visiting The Cherry Garden restaurant based in The Mandarin Oriental hotel Singapore. Cuisine absolutely outstanding and the service impeccable.We decided to go for the set meal consisting of eight courses, I may quickly add they a are perfectly sized portions and a great selection of excellent Wines.A truly wonderful Chinese Restaurant
5
Cherry Garden in Mandarin Oriental, Singapore at level 5 is decidedly one of best places to enjoy caontonese cuisine. We had a lovely evening with top class food and very efficient service. Both food and wine were fine, taste and presentation were out of this world. We also made friends with other diners who also shared their happiness with the food and service. The ambience was heavenly. It was a fulfilled evening for us
5
I have never experienced such a service until I stepped into the Mandarin Oriental, the staff was proactive and smiled upon seeing us. I thought I could find the way towards Cherry Garden but awed by the astounding design of the hotel, I was not able to navigate myself. Fortunately, the staff whom we walked passed seeing my confused state immediately came over to help and even offered to walk us up.After reaching the restaurant, service remained consistently excellent. I was served by a staff by the name of Koo and throughout lunch, never had I needed to raise my hand once to ask for anything. He could see it in a glance or once I lifted my gaze from the food. We were also conversing in English from the onset but once he noticed that I was communicating with my parents in Mandarin, he immediately spoke to me in mandarin to allow for an easier flow of conversation. Every recommended dish was nothing short of a new experience for the palate and my parents and I were able to taste many of the dishes since the restaurant allowed for portioning of different dishes for diners to do the same. When my mother had a question on a dish, Koo would immediately chime in and answer it when I don't know the answer to it. Also, he would never stand too close to make us feel like our private space was invaded but always close enough to anticipate our needs and wants.I had never experienced such fantastic service in Singapore be they mid-tiered or even some of the opulent restaurants. Singapore is filled with grumps in the service industry yet Mandarin Oriental is entirely different in that aspect
4
Service staffs are very attentive and helpful. Food is fresh and tasty. Had the peking duck which is very good and the remaining duck meat was deep fried to make into a crispy dish. Good experience overall. Worth a visit
5
We went to this restaurant on our first night, after an overnight trip from the US. Everyone was very patient and understanding in guiding us to our selections, which were excellent. The decor was also special. The staff was very attentive, but not to the point of discomfort. Highly recommended
4
Most of the food was delicious. My mom especially liked the chilli sauce. I also like that they served one dish at a time. Except that the gap in between sometime can be long. Waitress was also kind and cheerful and introduce every dish they serve. However, i would much appreciate if they can allow us to opt for hot desserts especially when dining on a rainy day
4
Very well furnished and decorated restaurant. Friendly and professional staff. Food was OK, ambiance left a better impression. Tiger prawns and lobster soup left much to be desired. Peking duck was quite good.
5
The quality of service and food were both excellent. We visit this restaurant every time we travel to Singapore and this dinner was outstanding. We even ordered a dish that was not on the menu which was cooked to perfection. For sure we will be back and highly recommend to others
5
Came for the holiday dim sum brunch buffet yesterday. Everything, every dish, was outstanding. I recommend just letting the waiter start you off with some of the favorites she/he recommends, and then expanding outward on the second time around. Some favorites: fried bean curd with chives, xiao long bao, mango almond prawn, and sautéed bok choy. It’s not a cheap meal. But it is definitely worth every cent (actually, I am confident it’s a good value). I will definitely go again.

Cherry Garden at Mandarine oriental is excellent restaurant which offers athentic food in excellent ambiance with superb service
1
In a city with many Chinese restaurants, this one was very expensive and very mediocre. We had a different place in mind, from previous visits, but the concierge at the hotel told us this was better. “Follow the money” was clearly the agenda. On the plus side, the decor was beautiful and the service excellent. A good place to visit, but eat someplace else
5
The family had two different variations of set dinners (min 2/set dinner choice) ranging from $98 - $138++. The quality, presentation, portions and taste of the food were good to excellent. While most restaurants in the same league serves only 5 courses at the same price range, Cherry Garden offers 7 courses. Credit card discount of 15% is also applicable to set dinner. The service was good but they were not very accommodating with corkage waiver even for a very special occasion that comes once in 25 years..
5
Beautiful setting and excellent menu with well executed dishes and amazing desserts. Nice experience for a relaxing Sunday brunch
5
We celebrated our 11th year wedding anniversary with our little ones here this year.The restaurant has never failed to impress us with the quality of food and exceptional services.Their weekend dim sum is Ala carte buffet type, priced at $80.50 nett per adult. Food presentation is great and the taste is yummy too. We made a reservation for their first seating from 11am to 1pm.What is commendable is the wonderful service from Michelle. She is attentive, friendly and able to understand and recommend dishes that suit our family. Both our boys enjoyed interacting with her and she never fail to make our baby smile! This is the restaurant that I feel we should visit at least once to try out their exquisite food and great service
5
One of the best Dim Sum in Singapore. Very friendly and attentive waiters, especially Koo which served us. He is very professional and always smiling. The table behind us was a little difficult but he was still friendly and patient. Food was tasty and the portion size was nice. They can provide you the number of dim sum you want in one basket instead of the usual 3 pcs in one basket which is hard to share if you have only two people. Nice roast pork and duck.Save some space for the dessert. You will not regret the extra calories from the dessert
5
Strange as it seems, but with only a two day visit to Singapore, we were struggling to find a quiet elegant Chinese restaurant. Thousands of noisy, fast-food options but after a look on TA, we chose Cherry Garden and are very pleased we did. After seeing several Peking Ducks being served, we just had to opt for a half which was elegantly sliced and made up into delicate pancake wafers and served with delicious sauce and accompaniments. We followed this up with crispy sweet and sour chicken, rice and noodles, despite warnings from our waitress that we had ordered too much! What we didn't realise was that the rest of our half-duck had been taken away and was brought back out as part of the main course fare. She was right of course - it was too much, but as it was all so delicious, we ate more than enough to do it justice. Food and service were both fantastic and our only criticism was for the wine, where the cheapest bottle is $100++ we felt was a bit over priced, but it was our last night so still worth it
5
The interior was renovated some time ago and it’s now a lot better with brighter lightings and very Chinese type of interior like what you see in the movies with raised platforms. Food wise, it was epic. Their Peking duck and fried rice was my favourite. In terms of service, it was TOP notch!
5
Located in the mandarin oriental, this restaurant propose a large variety of Cantonese food. All made with fresh product, perfectly cooked.... we experienced tasty crispy eggplant, Crispy duck, and scallop ... all excellent.The restaurant is comfortable with nice decoration and friendly efficient service ... very efficient!)))Certainly not to miss if you are hosted à thé Mandarin Oriental

Cherry Garden certainly gives every impression that it's about to earn a five star review - the service is excellent, the decor and situation of the restaurant is impressive, and the shiitake appetiser is really very good. In particular the staff were perfectly accommodating to me as a solo traveller for whom the serving sizes - designed to be shared - would be too large.But the dishes themselves - while perfectly executed - did not have the panache you want from fine dining. They would all have benefitted from bolder flavours (though I would suppose with the Peking Duck there's not much to be done other than with the sauce), and I would have liked the chefs to have demonstrated more confidence in their skills. There were no errors but no brilliancies; it's not often I walk away from a fine dining meal feeling like I haven't learned anything about food.(I do wonder if by focusing on the "signature" dishes I inadvertently ordered "safer" dishes; you might try casting a wider net across the menu than I did)The dessert - an almond cream with glutinous rice dumpling - was excellent however.If you want a dependable upper-end Chinese meal with superb service, the Cherry Garden will serve you well. But it's not a foodie experience
4
Had family Sunday Dim Sun brunch. Food was great and staff a very polite. Overall great value for such an extensive menu of dim sum. Only negative is that I felt we were being constantly pushed to order, have dessert and settle the bill for the next sitting
5
We had such a good experience at the Cherry Garden. The food was ridiculously good! We enjoyed a perfect Peking duck and some other perfect prepared dim sum dishes. The service was also excelent
4
Cherry Garden offers fine dining style lunch set and the amount is just nice if you are not looking for a heavy meal. The service was excellent and the food was above average, which have areas of improvement since it is a Michelin star restaurant. Overall it is a great experience with the Chinese themed deco and great service by the staff.
5
We did the weekend dim sum lunch with our children aged 8 and 10. The food was amazing. Best of all was our waiter, Keat Yong. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made delicious suggestions. He was attentive without being intrusive and because of him, we tried many new wonderful foods. The service and food made this the highlight of our trip. Thank you Cherry Garden
4
This restaurant is conveniently located in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. The service was excellent and the Cantonese menu we add was delicious. However, the restaurant is quite dark with few windows and the tables were close together. It wasn't really a cozy atmosphere. But if you are staying in the hotel and love fine dining, it's definitely worth a try
5
Good place for family gathering. The service was excellent, ambience was great. They prepared a birthday cake which was nice gesture
4
Good food and good service. The service staffs were very attentive and offered suggestions. The staffs surprised us with a small cake as it was our wedding anniversary. Will be back.
5
Sunday Dim Sum Brunch at Cherry Garden.Food yummy, service and attention to details immaculate!Dim Sum will never be the same again. Will be back
4
Decided to try the brunch for hubby's birthday. A little expensive ($68/adult & $40/child), but they do serve quality food and in good portion size. Kids loved the xo carrot cake, and they hv good roast pork and char siew. They even provided a birthday cake for the hubby and coincidentally 3 other tables were also there to celebrate birthdays. Good service too. The only downside was the 2 seatings and felt our brunch was too rushed. The first seating is at 11am with last order at 12.30. But still worth the splurge.
4
Nice food. Great service. A little over the top expensive. Nice environment. If you're looking for a quiet environment with a fine dining experience, cherry garden is the place.
5
Whilst staying at the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore we always make sure that we dine at least one evening at the Cherry Garden - we did this last night. Our meal was exquisite and delicious in every way from the presentation to the wonderful flavours of each dish. Koo was our waiter and was extremely attentive and helpful in every way. Thank you also to the Restaurant Manager for our anniversary cake, you all made everything so special. Thank you Cherry Garden for yet another wonderful experience, we cannot wait to return.
5
Staff were polite and reservations team very thoughtful. Dim sum brunch menu changed a little so we could try new dishes this time (it was our third visit)
5
The restaurant offers 2 seating for weekend lunch, 11am or 1pm for the a la carte Dim Sum buffet. The food was delicious with ample choices. The best part was the desserts. There were 5 different ones and my Friend and I had to have all 5. We went there for my birthday celebration. The restaurant did not miss the chance to surprise me with a delicious chocolate cake. The lovely waitress by the name of Joy was definitely a joyful lady. Full of smiles, very polite and well versed with the menu. What a perfect place for a perfect lunch
5
We visited Cherry Garden for our anniversary and had their Dim Sum Brunch. It was pricey so we had high expectations. A great ambience greeted us and it was a small restaurant which was good for special occasions as it will not be over crowded as most restaurants are, and it was spacious yet cozy at the same time! Great place with a great view. Interior was tastefully done to incorporate Chinese accents yet remain classy. We liked the variety in the menu and the food was great. You will be spoilt for choices for starters, mains and desserts. Quality ingredients were used and presentation was beautiful. A must try is their roast pork and prawn dumplings. Their staff were also friendly and professional and the ratio of staff to guests was just nice. We were even given a cake and sincere wishes for our anniversary. We may come here again for the food and service, only consideration is the price. Worth a try especially for a special occasion though
5
Great Chinese restaurant. Good layout, deco is good and most important quiet. Table are spaced well such that other tables don't disturb each other. Food was great as well.
4
Went for a post race Grand Prix dinner. I liked the service there, impeccable. Great presentation although my husband found it quite oily and salty. Nevertheless it was the Mandarin Oriental. Ambiance is excellent. Prices are reasonable for hotel rates.
5
Have always gone to Cherry Garden for special events as this place holds a dear memory for me. Service and food excellent as always. Delighted with the new menu with some changes
5
Great host. Great service. Service crews are attentive and fast. Food is good, nice and cozy ambience!
5
Small serving and it is just nice for a small group like 2-3 persons. Great service, staff are very attentive and polite. Will definitely revisit this restaurant again.

Was having severe 'dim sum' craving during my pregnancy so we visited a few dim sum places and Cherry garden was one of the recommended. In fact, we visited most of the places that were recommended. I would say this was only an average place. The signature dishes recommended were quite disappointing. Perhaps we were expecting more from the good reviews but this is a one time to go place for us. However, the desserts are good. We had like 4 servings of their desserts!!
4
Staying at the Mandarin Oriental we decided to stay in house for our first night out in Singapore. The staff. venue and menu at the Cherry Garden were delightful. We had a Spritz cocktail on arrival and selected the "Wok fried prawns in dried chilli, onions and cashews" and the "Braised ee-f noodles with conpay, enoki, mushroom, bean sprout and yellow chives" from the menu. The cocktail and dinner were all spectacular
5
My daughter took my wife for mother's day bruch here. Such a lovely atmosphere. Impeccable service. Fresh flowers lovely designs and beautiful room. The unlimited dim sum was served to table as chosen from a beautiful menu.Small deletcable artfully presented portions of the very best and delicious dim sum recipes.Also wonderful congees, desserts and selections of teas and other beverages. Very specail. Very exoti
4
The service by the staff was warm hearted, welcoming and good. Food is a little disappointed as the peking duck was cold and not cracking
5
Went to Cherry Garden for a Dim Sum Buffet with family to celebrate an occasion - and we had a really good time!Food: ala carte buffet style; quite a wide variety, serving size was just nice based on no.of pax and very good quality. Especially the wasabi prawns and soup. Desserts are a must. Ambience: quiet and very conducive for conversations. Service: excellent service, our server was Joy and she was very professional, intuitive, friendly and it was a real pleasure having her - she even gave my mom a shawl when she noticed through her body language that she was feeling cold. Thank you!Would highly recommend this place for family gatherings!
3
Food and service were good. However the main issue was the inflexibility of the Dining Society membership program. Diners can only sign up for the membership program after the first dining. The benefits of the membership would then start the subsequent visit. The benefit includes the accumulation of the points based on the amount spent. This means no matter how much you spent during the first visit, no points would be accumulated. Hence I would suggest diners who are interested in signing up in this program to spend the minimum amount, just enough to sign up for their membership program to get the most value out of this program. Although I do not understand the rationale for not allowing points to be accumulated during the first visit, I do hope that there will be changes in future. My first experience dinning with Cherry Garden would be perfect if not for this Dining Society membership issue
4
Visited Cherry Garden for a Mother's Day lunch. Wasabi prawns were my absolute favourite, dishes - especially dim sum were presented in ornate, pretty little steamers and the roasted chicken was another winner when it came to taste. I enjoyed both the mango and avocado-based desserts they offered too, but the Mother's Day special - berry was a disappointment. Great dining experience overall though
5
Second dinner here and didn't disappoint. We love how the mains can be in a small, medium or large size which then gave us the opportunity to try a few different dishes. All good was tasty and beautifully presented and it was great our knowledgeable waitress Joy gave us a few suggestions as well. The service was fantastic. Thanks again to Joy and Karen for making us feel welcome yet again.
3
few dishes to recommend:
1) Peking duck
2) Cherry Garden Platter (the beef is so soft, delicious)
3) Claypot beef brisket and tendon
4) Pumpkin mushroom soup with dice chicken
5) Avocado ceram with walnut ice-cream
4
This restaurant is situated in a very lovely environment and the food is good. Unfortunately, we had a new, inexperienced and not well trained staff serving us. We asked for desert menu but got the bill. Again we asked for the deserts menu and place orders for deserts. But only one order came and two other orders were conveniently left out.
5
Menu selections were with good options and the dishes were prepared to the top standard with excellent ingredients of freshness. Service was very attentive and pro-active with good suggestions. This place is well deserved for Michelin star and much better experience than the Michelin star Chinese restaurant nearby
5
We had one of the set menus. Each dish was very good. About seven courses in all. Great setting and good staff. Would recommend 
4
I like the food and the variety of food. Portions across the dishes can very significantly eg the wasbai prawns is enormous, whereas I felt the pork belly was small. Not great value but you are paying for the food, decor and brand. Much better than Jade @Fullerton.Thought the staff were nice and polite in keeping with what you would expect from the hotel.Personally, the hotel feels a bit weird with the massive interior, loos are miles away as well. Also the hotel does not connect to the mall so if you come by MRT and want to void stairs there is a roundabout (non sign posted) route. Not the easiest MRT to get to either but I suppose we were commoners coming by public transport and not by executive car...Lots of small steps (which I find it quite funny that the staff continuously warn you about), so not wheelchair/buggy friendly
5
Had Dinner here during my stay at the MO SIN. Excellent Chinese cuisine. Seating very good. Service also. Can recommend
1
Went there for a family dinner. Food was decent. But the service seriously needs improvement. Family asked for the dessert menu, everyone got a menu except me. When we ordered, I put my menu on the table, the staff cleared the menu for everyone else except me again. Seriously, on my first visit there? And to think I expected better from a hotel restaurant.I am never coming back here anymore
5
Some of the best dim sum my mouth has ever had the pleasure of tasting. The best thing about the weekend brunch buffet is that they have a really impressive selection of things to choose from - roasted pork belly, wasabi prawns, noodles, and of course dim sum, done perfectly. The only complaint I have is that they charged us $8 for a pretty crappy glass of coke. FO REAL, CHERRY GARDEN?! At least give me the entire can if you're going to mark up something by 800%!!! #outrageous Aside from that, absolutely loved it and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anynone
3
The food is is not outstanding considering you must pay a very high price for small portions. Service was OK . It seemed like Chinese food with a Western twist to attract hotel guests. Better choices await you in Chinatown
5
When it comes to business dinners, we are never short of options for good restaurants.Recent dinner at Cherry Garden revived that tasty memory of authentic oriental cuisine which I have tasted some years back. In my humble opinion, Cherry Garden has maintains it's quality over the years.The BBQ mix meat platter was an exciting dish for our German guest.Braised tofu with mushroom dish, and hot & sour soup are 2 dishes we would re-visit for. (Tofu skin's light crisp with soft-smooth internal, soup's ingredient rich.)I suppose the most simple dish is probably the toughest to captivate taste buds. Cherry Garden's Ee Fu noodles which we had at this business dinner was fantastic
4
I ate here on the recommendation of one of the staff members at the hotel I was staying at. I stayed at the Ritz next door but their restaurant was closed for a private party. The food was very good, especially the wasabi shrimp (it was very hot but delicious). It was definitely very pricey but the quality of food was very high. Only negative is that it's not a great place to eat alone. There's no bar so I was seated in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by mostly families. Felt a little odd and out of place. But other than that, great restaurant.
4
The food and service are good. The waitress are friendly and polite. They clear your dishes and pour tea for you. The food serving is fast. I dine alone, so they provided newspaper & magazine for me to read. The ambience is cosy, relaxing and not so noisy. Thank you for everything
5
Went there with my partner for dinner. It is about Chinese fine dining. The menu consisted of many courses and all of them were faultless. Romantic ambience and very very kind personnel
3
Excellent service and decor. Had ala carte dinner on a Saturday night. Alas, food was a little below expectations. Peking duck , double-boiled soup, noodles were all just mediocre. Beef cubes and wasabi prawns were slightly better. Desserts were the only "exceptional" and unique items. Overall a little disappointed with the standard of food. Definitely not at par with similar class Chinese fine dining restaurants
5
The service, ambience and feel were great. Went there for buffet dim sum, everything was great except for the fish, it would be nice if there is a steam option.
5
Great experiences dining at Cherry Garden. A wide range of choices for the dim sum brunch on the weekends. All dishes are delicious
4
Very nice restaurantDespite some negative reviews I read on TripAdvisor about service, we actually found me the service to be first rateA number of really good dishes; others reasonableMy only slight negative was that for two of us, the total bill was S$300. Had 6 beers between us and the rest of the bill was on food. Food was very good but for S$300, you expect something quite outstanding - this was good, but not exceptiona
4
Went here for evening dinner - Keat Yong served us and I could not fault the quality of service. It is quite expensive however the food is of good quality and the setting is very nice. Great to try somewhere new
4
The atmosphere alone was breath taking and the food was amazing! With that said it was the most expensive Chinese food I've ever eaten!! Was it worth it... not sure but it sure was good.
5
Went there for the Dim Sum brunch with several friends. Really enjoyed the food as well and the great service offer. Great value for quality food + service. Definitely will come back again 
5
awesome set up of restaurant with foods with special tastes not commonly foundgreat service despite the slightly rushed sunday brunc
4
More intimate than the typical chinese hotel restaurant it offers well prepared not too complicated enjoyable dishes.
5
Went to Cherry Garden to celebrate my mom's birthday. My fanily really love the dishes there. And we experienced good service by Annabelle, Dong and a manager I guess. We would definitely come back again.
5
An excellent brunch, sharing unlimited platters of outstanding Oriental cuisine - probably the best meal of this type that I have ever eaten anywhere in the World
5
feeling home there, smily service, nice wodden design and the food is excellent! very reffined chinese food, great experience!
5
My wife and I had dinner here. Great authentic food in a good atmosphere. The service was great and we really enjoyed our intimate meal in very nice surroundings. In fact our whole Mandarin Oriental experience was superb.
3
One of the first place in Singapore we visited for Sunday lunch. We had quite high expectations (guess that's the problem) since it is in MO, and itself had good reviews. The food wasn't bad, and in fact served in a nice way. However the waitress didn't smile or try to be nice/ polite/ showing courtesy the whole lunch, which surprised me. I see a hotel at this level, and restaurant at this level really should pay attention to its servicing employees as much as the food. Overall was a bit disappointing I have to say. Lunch is limitless food so if you are after that this might be a good place (at MO price of course). Unfortunately we haven't gone back since
4
Second time we have done this. You need a very empty stomach! And a large wallet.Quality of food is excellent. The crispy skin roast pork was particularly yummy. Only "complaint" is that we had to ask for Worcester sauce for the deep fried dishes like bean curd roll. But it was brought to us fairly quickly.Service is faultless by our friendly Joy.
5
Considering its location (in the Mandarin Oriental) and its beautiful setting I expected this to be an over priced place. Not at all. The Cantonese food was excellent - especially the Peking duck. The cod in soy was to die for, as well as the wagyu beef. Service was tops. Just a phenomenal experience that also wasn't over the top. Will certainly revisit
3
Mandarin Oriental is beautiful, restaurant itself is elegantly designed and a lot better looking than from the photos, food is decent, price is reasonable, service is satisfying on average. I will just talk about one outlier. One of our waitress is really bossy and annoying. (a) After we ordered our first appetizer, she tried to promote one of their dishes. I kindly told her, let us finish the rest of the order and then we will consider whether we still need that. She demanded instead: we need to first finish ordering appetizer, and then we can order the rest. (b) We were asked whether a certain dish can be taken away, I told the waitress that we would still like to finish the leftovers. After a while, she just came up and took away our own plates and chopsticks without asking. (c) We were quite full after the meal, so four of us decided to order two desserts to share. She told us firmly, desserts are per person and cannot be shared. Somehow, her attitude and behavior reminds me of the Thai maid that Samantha met in one of the sex and the city episode (I just checked the name of the episode "the caste system"). I'm sure that would please certain types of customers, but certainly not the rest. I wonder whether that is purely personal or is actually driven by the training of the restaurant to promote new dishes and increase turnovers
2
A very nice ambience restaurant but lack in service. We had to request for refill of tea a few times & the restaurant is pretty empty. Food was so-so and nothing to rave about. Customer service definitely need to brush up. For the price I've paid, I'm not impressed
4
The cherry garden is a chinese restaurant in the Mandarin Oriental. Service was great and very friendly and the food was good. The peking duck was great - they actually carve the duck and then serve it on the pancakes for you! Our waiter was friendly and helpful. A good meal which we greatly enjoyed
4
I wanted to do something a bit special with Hubby when we visited Singapore so I decided to book Cherry Garden restaurant for dim sum buffet. It literally combines the two best things together: dim sum and buffet. Hubby was so excited for it and we even arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes before it opened for trading. We went for the first seating that started at 11 AM.The restaurant was quite grandeur and calm at the same time. The dark wooden furniture gave a very classy feel to the whole restaurant. Hubby and I were used to the bustling dim sum carts and noisy tables. I think it was quite calm because there were only a few people that morning. We quite enjoyed the warm and luxurious atmosphere at Cherry Garden. Yes, there wasn't any dim sum carts rolling around the place that morning. We ordered what we wanted off the buffet menu through the friendly staff. Our tea pot always got refilled promptly by them too. The menu also consists of soup & appetisers, desserts and other hot Chinese dishes (rice, congee, noodles, seafood, meat, vegetables).We started off with something light so we ordered the rice congee and a serving of hot and sour soup. The rice congee came with the century egg and shredded pork while the hot and sour soup contained a good amount of seafood in it. Both items look small in the photo but the size of the serving bowl was actually really good. We really enjoyed our deep fried Chinese-bun that came with chilli crab meat sauce. It was so yummy and if there wasn't any time limit on the buffet I'd just sit there and keep on ordering this dish (heheh).We ordered quite a few dishes from the dim sum selection such as chicken feet in black bean sauce, pork siew mai with baby abalone, juicy pork xiao long bao, and the yummy deep-fried escargot dumplings. I never seen or heard of any escargot dumplings before so we decided to order it. It was a sweet and creamy surprise! The Kurobuta char siew bao had a really fluffy exterior and juicy sweet meats on the inside.We really liked how the serving is suited for the number of people in your group. As it was only me and hubby, they gave us a small serving of the braised beef fillet. The beef was really tender and juicy.We really enjoyed our brunch at Cherry Garden and looking forward to go back there again next time we're in Singapore. The dim sum costs SGD $68 per person and there are two seatings available: 11 AM to 1 PM or 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM. It's definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion as well although you might want to book in advance for weekend or public holiday seating

This place is not like a restaurant, it reminds more a canteen. It's loud and very full of business people. The service was excellent! But the food wasn't nothing much. Specially for the price you have to pay. Overrated for what they offer

The restaurant was busy during Chinese New Year period. Service was fast, efficient & friendly (deserved the tips I happily gave out).Food was great. Had the $120 Joyous Set. Started with Yu Sheng (raw fish celebratory salad) with fresh salmon & crispy fried salmon skins; first time we had this interesting combination. Pumpkin soup with morel mushrooms & bird's nest - refreshing & tasty. Just small flakes of bird nest of course.Large wasabi prawns & sautéed scallop in XO sauce combo - nice as expected. Always like wasabi prawns.Braised 8-headed abalone, "hair" veggie & bean curd skin wrapped over dried oyster - cooked well.Roast plate with lean Char Siew, crackling pork & duck - went superbly with mustard & plum sauces.Steamed Cod fish with black fungus & mushrooms - a healthy choice.Shanghai lunar new year rice cakes (Nian Gao) with minced Kurobuta pork was a favourite.Ended with a most original dessert: Nu Er Hong & Gui Hua Chinese wine Spherics!!! with a lychee sorbet. First time I had these burst-in-yr-mouth alcoholic Spherics.Enjoyed dinner. Will return. Great Cantonese food

We were there during the two weekChinese New Year celebrations and the place was buzzing. But the staff took all that in their stride and had time and desire to make sure we enjoyed the eveningThe Peking Duck served crispy with pancakes and then succulent as meat was exquisite.The signature chicken with cashew nuts is great and loved the prawns done two ways.Good wine by glass selection.Lovely design and ambiance
5
We had picked out this restaurant to dine at during our stay at the Madarin Oriental and made sure that we booked early.The restaurant specializes in modern Chinese food and Peking duck. They have a set menu or you can select from small, medium or large serves of several different dishes. We had a look at the menu, selected a few options and then let the waiter decide the order, size and if we had the right mix. Extremely helpful and they didn’t try to up sell to bigger serves. We had a fish dish, Peking duck, 1/2 lobster, pork belly, rice and Chinese tea. Each dish excellent, beautifully presented and very reasonably priced.Certainly one of the best meals we had during our stay in Singapor

I booked this restaurant months ago as we were going to be in Singapore for Chinese New Year. I wanted a very good Chinese restaurant and from the reviews this looked to be one of the best. I choose the Prosperity set menu which started with what we were told is a ceremonial dish unique to Singapore of salmon and crispy fish skin that Joy delightfully took us through and explained the significance of. Very special and set a nice start to the evening. This course was followed by a delicious pumpkin soup with bird's nest, moral mushrooms and diced chicken. The next course was sauteed lobster with mushroom in XO sauce followed by steamed cod fillet, which I think was my favourite. Pan fried Wagyu beef and then a lovely black bean pudding with Japanese sesame ice cream completed the meal. Absolutely fabulous. The ambiance and decoration is fantastic. And to top it off the service was up there with the best I have experienced. Joy looked after us through the meal and was just the best. Jan the director of restaurants was brilliant,he made sure we felt very comfortable and the evening was perfect. This certainly guaranteed that even if we do not stay at the Mandarin Oriental on our next visit to Singapore we will certainly be eating at Cherry Garden.
5
Had a great lunch here and the service and food is always incredible! Joy is especially sensitive to guest needs and anticipating what we needed before we even knew we wanted it! Highly recommend Cherry Garden for anyone looking for a fine dining Cantonese meal in Singapore

We first landed up at the Mandarin Marina and discovered that this restaurant was actually in the Mandarin Oriental. Fortunately just a short walk away. The hotel is furnished quite gorgeously. We had booked prior and so at the restaurant we were led to our table immediately and the drinks with appetisers served promptly. The Barbecued platter had 3 meats and all were delicious. In the Mains we ordered Chicken, Cod and Chilli Crab; all three dishes were superb although the first two were a little too sweet.All of us felt that this was definitely one of the best meals we had on Singapore during this trip. The staff is friendly without being overbearing or intrusive, the clientele was family oriented and the decor was soothing without being over the top. And pleasantly priced
3
Went there for lunch on a weekday afternoon and it was fairly crowded. Restaurant has a nice interior design.
4
Food and ambience was great... but they were very stingy with red packets for CNY. Wine is good but pricey... $130 plus for house wine bottles. Food portion can be larger but overall service is good.
4
Went there for dim sum lunch to celebrate friend's birthday. Service was fantastic! The service staff were all very attentive and smiley. They prepared a birthday cake for my friend when they knew it's her birthday. Dim sum was not the best we had but some dishes are quite unique. Good place for business lunch on weekdays as it's quite quiet
5
With my recent visit at Mandarin Oriental Cherry Garden i can say that they're not only famous for dimsum buffet and peking duck but all the staff were so nice and warm. Shoutout to their Assistant Manager -Ms Razzel who really assisted us from the moment we walked in inside their lovely resto til we finished our sumptious dinner! Amazing how Mandarin train their staffs as that is what matters most! Good job!
5
This was our second visit to this restaurant. After the first four years ago we had to return when passing through Singapore next. We visited this restaurant for Christmas Eve. We will most definitely return. The service is of a great quality and the food wonderful for all ages. The wine list is also very extensive with wines from all around the world
3
We are at the Mandarin Oriental and this evening we had a dinner at Cherry Garden. The food was great and the service was excellent, but paying for 2 bottles of still water (S$16 for the regular one and S$14 for the small one) as much as we paid for the 2 main courses that we had seems a bit wrong to me....
5
Had a great dinner last night! Food was really amazing! The trilogy of mushroom, perch and Korobuta pork rib and also the amazing dessert!! Wow! Will be back again!
5
The best you can imagine! The waiter took pity on us, westerners, and ordered for us! We had one of everything! Nothing we didn't like. They even had Peking Duck!we ate for more than 1 hour and a half
5
Attended this restaurant twice during my stay at the Mandarin Oriental last week. The quantity of food and the service in this restaurant is exceptional. My favourite dish has to be the cod in light soy sauce, but the beef cubes and sweet and sour pork were just as good. The ambiance is exceptional, and staff gracious and accommodating. I believe that the menu on the whole will appeal to many and is diverse and inclusive of all tastes. For dessert my favourite has to be the mango pudding - I had it twice!! Exceptional
5
The beautiful and quiet environment make us feel so comfortable. The foods are good, very local and tasty chinese cuisine. The most impressive past is the service. Actually its my first time business meeting and I don't know what to order. A very friendly staff called JOY helped me a lot and made the meeting very successful.I will surely recommend my friends to Cherry Garden
4
The Mandarin Oriental has an Italian, Japanese, Morton's Steak house and their generic large restaurant. But for authentic Chinese food fixed in the Cantonese style you won't go wrong. Service is superb. All servings co me in small, medium or large size -- perfect for sharing depending on the size of your group. Enjoy.
5
Quality a la minute dim sum brunch with good selections; highly recommend the kurubota bun, double boiled soup and almond dessert. The chef uses very good quality products and food is very flavourful.The service is also very attentive
4
Tucked in the 5th floor of Mandarin Oriental Hotel, a nice and quiet place to enjoy good Chinese food. Wasabi prawn and steam fish were my favorite. High price, though. One steamed garoupa fish costs about $200 but was very well done! We cleaned out the entire dish! The restaurant has a strange policy that requires an advance deposit for bookings for 10 or more people. So, book for 9 then add on upon arrival!Excellent service by the staff. External roof garden to take a short walk but view is nothing to shout about
5
Great way to enjoy a lazy few hours eating delicious dum sum in a very lovely setting. Staff are very helpful and attentive. Best to share a table with lots of friends to sample all the delights on the large menu
4
We always say so: It's the easiest dishes that's the most difficult to make. Why? it's because one can test the "基本功" or "basic skills" that can really see whether one is a good chef. And I'm so happy to say that the chef at the Cherry Garden simply nailed it.I had one of the best "Shiu Mei" that I have ever tasted, and I'm kind of a "meat person" or carnivorous, I do enjoy some veggie dishes and they were just delicious as well (espeicially and "Golden and Silver Eggs with Amaranth". Service was also exemplary and matches the excellence service of the MO. Would like to try their dim sim when I come here next time
5
Had dinner at Cherry Garden with a friend. Awesome Chinese food. Try out their set menus or if you are more adventurous try ordering a la carte. We had one of the set menus but added on a Wagyu fried rice. Their wine collection is excellent. Try pairing a spicy Chinese dish with a soft moscato ....The staff is forever willing to help and recommend with choices. Right from the minute you step in and someone reminds you of the step to the point you leave you will be enveloped in a bubble of attentive but not intrusive service ! Great dining experience ....
5
Wonderful atmosphere, Joy our waitress was excellent and lead us through the extensive menu. The food was excellent, this chef really knows what he is doing!You won't be disappointed
5
Dim sum at Cherry Garden is one of the best in Singapore, especially their siew mai with baby abalone, steamed custard bun w yam, wasabi-aioli prawns with fresh mango and fish roe. Service was immaculate too. Definitely heading back for more
5
My parents and I were there to have a casual dinner with my fiancee and my future mother in law. We enjoyed the privacy during the course of the dinner which was rather hard to get by in a normal Chinese restaurant. We enjoyed beautiful oriental interior of this fine restaurant as much as the delicious Cantonese food. You got to try the wasabi prawn there! We were really happy to be served by the delightful and attentive Annabel. The price was in the acceptable range too! Will definitely bring my overseas relatives there when they visit Singapore
5
This beautiful restaurant offers a fantastic choice of food and excellent service. The bird's nest soup was outstanding as was the lamb dish and the chicken with the crispy skin. The abalone was tender and tasty. The service in this restaurant is outstanding and we were fortunate enough to be served by Joy and Nicole who made our visit here so enjoyable. Joy took a beautiful photo of us at the start of the evening and presented us with a framed photo as we ate our meal. We would recommend this stunning restaurant to anyone who appreciates high class oriental fusion. We have eaten here twice during our stay in Singapore and hope to return before we leave
5
Our go too spot for when you need a dim sum fix and it needs to be a bit special. Consistently good dim sum coupled with good service, on this occasion the double boiled mushroom soup needs a special mention, I don't think I have ever ordered the same dish 3 times at a sitting but it was fantastic and I almost wanted to have a cold or flu as this would have been a guaranteed cure!
5
We went to the Cherry Garden for our wedding anniversary and the service was impeccable. Both my wife and myself had differing 7 course set meals. A great little touch was the restaurant taking our picture and presenting to us in a special frame
5
I especially love the interiors of the restaurant. The food they serve here are fresh, delicious and the staff are really professional. I'll come back here for more. Don't forget to order the dessert at the end of the meal.
5
We had a delicious lunch at Cherry Garden. I loved the Peking duck, homemade tofu & eggplant with chicken floss especially, although everything we ordered was prepared to perfection. The desserts we ordered were creative & unusual from the normal desserts one finds in most Cantonese restaurants. I loved the sesame pudding & their avocado cream with walnut ice cream.What made our lunch more memorable & enjoyable were the elegant surroundings & the exceptional & attentive service provided. This is a lovely place to go for a special lunch as prices are in keeping with the setting & location but definitely worth it in my opinion
5
Lovely restaurant with superb food in attractive setting within The Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Singapore.Courteous staff and excellent service.The chef, carving up the delicious Peking Duck, was clearly passionate about his food which he wanted you to enjoy..Lovely meal and worth a visit if you like well executed Cantonese cuisine
5
My wife and I had spent the previous 4 nights exploring the many and varied delights of Singapore's food halls, where for very little outlay you can eat like the proverbial king and queen, but on our last night we wanted to splash out on something special, and, specifically, Chinese - mainly because we live in Madrid, where what Chinese food you can track down is served to you directly from around 1970. The problem is that Singapore is of course awash with choice, so how to choose? In the end, we booked a table at the Cherry Garden on a recommendation from my sister, who had eaten there earlier in the year and raved about it.After a cordial greeting and the serving of tea, our waitress, Joy answered our questions about portion sizes (my experience of Chinese restaurants, mainly in London, involves over-ordering on a biblical scale) and recommendations and generally pointed us in the right direction. Her advice turned out to spot-on.We started with one of CG's signature dishes, 'crispy wasabi-aioli prawns with fresh mango and tobiko', along with the 'trilogy of handpicked mushrooms' (enoki, crispy shiitake and monkey head). The latter was good (three contrasting textures, flavours and dressings), but the former was simply sensational - crikey, I could quite happily have just carried on eating more of those prawns for the rest of the meal...But I'm glad I didn't, because the 'Cantonese-style roasted crackling pork belly' that arrived next was quite simply one of the most divine things I have ever put in my mouth. On the long thin porcelain plate sat eight little towers of scrumptiousness, each about the size and shape of two dice in a stack and topped with a waffer-thin layer of crispy, melt-on-the-tongue crackling. I live in the land of cochinillo asado so I like to think I know my pig, but blimey, Charlie, this was something else.Surely it couldn't get any better than this? Well actually... no, it couldn't possibly, but it got pretty close in the form of the 'Cherry Garden's Peking duck with traditional condiments', helpfully delivered (as we had requested) as a small portion consisting of 4 small-ish pancakes. Joy prepared them for us at the table using just a pair of chopsticks - which only added to the sense of ceremony - and they were moist, delicate and delicious.On the side we ordered the 'stir-fried rice vermicelli with seafood, silver sprouts and yellow chives' (OK, a little unimaginative on our part, perhaps, but we both love it). Again, as requested, a small portion to share, and again, yummy.So what does all this add up to? Well, firstly, hats off to our waitress, Joy, for her advice on portion size and how much to order. Thanks to her we chose exactly the right amount for our appetites. Secondly, hats off to the chef: nothing disappointed that evening, two items were really very good indeed (the Peking duck and the wasabi-aioli prawns) and one was a masterpiece that will live long in the memory (the crackling pork belly, obvs).We shall return..

Fancied some 'upmarket' dim sum so did sunday brunch here and we were not disappointed. Staff were attentive and quick to respond and the food was fantastic. Would recommend the char siew pork, shrimp dumpling and roasted duck. It was nice to be able to pick from the menu rather than a buffet and we could just order more as we went along. Desserts were lovely and light too. Would go agai

I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Singapore for 4 nights in August 2016. I visited Cherry Garden for an early dinner one evening. It was superb. There was a huge choice on the menu, but I eventually settled on small portions of the wasabi-aioli king prawns to start, the Cantonese BBQ sampler platter (duck, pork, and crispy belly pork), a side dish of asparagus in a spicy XO sauce and a side dish of special fried rice with scallops, ginger and spring onion. All absolutely delicious, especially the wasabi-aioli king prawns. I washed it all down with some lovely jasmine tea and some freshly pressed pineapple juice. My waiter and all the other staff were superb. They were attentive without being intrusive, and my waiter made some good suggestions and recommendations and tried to get me even smaller and less expensive portions than the small portions on the menu. Nevertheless, I still couldn't come close to eating it all (except the wasabi-aioli king prawns, which were a starter size portion which I did manage to polish off!) and I have a very good appetite. It was a huge amount of food, clearly the small portions are designed for 2 people, which is a shame for any hotel guests dining on their own because it means that a lot of food must get wasted. However, my waiter once again made a good suggestion, which was that I could take the leftovers of the asparagus and the BBQ sampler away with me and he dutifully boxed it up for me in nice food containers. Overall, an excellent meal in a nice atmosphere served on beautiful crockery with lovely teacups. I can heartily recommend the Cherry Garden. I would like to eat there again next time I am in Singapore. I think that I will try the cod in homemade soy sauce and the osmanthus jelly next time
5
Me and my wife went to Cherry Garden for dinner. We were shown to our tables and asked if we had any dietary requirements. The service was top notch, the food was even better. Really impressed by the starters and the mains we had ordered. The ambiance is 5* and I loved the setting of the restaurant, it does help when the restaurant is set in Mandarin Oriental. Its a beautiful place and I would highly recommend it to all Cantonese food lovers.It wasn't overly busy and all our requests were handled. Go for it
4
Food is very good. Can tell the Chef put in their great effort in preparing the dishes. The service provided by the staff is excellent as well.
4
My wife and I ate dinner here as we were staying in the Mandarin Hotel. The ambiance and decor are wonderful, as is the service. The staff are very knowledgeable about the extensive menu and wine list, and happy to make recommendations. We ate a fixed price menu. The food was very good, but not outstanding- I found a lot of the food to be a bit too salty and the flavors weren't spectacular for the price. But overall it is a very good restaurant and worth a visit
4
At $68 for adults and $40 for children the buffet dim sum is good value. You can order from a menu.There are two seatings so you only have two hours which should be enough for most normal people.Service was good. Quality of waiting staff improved a lot. But there are still some Chinese waitresses who speak in Mandarin. At a five star hotel and top restaurant the manager should select bilingual staff and train them to tune in to what their customers prefer to speak in.To get a Michelin, things to improve: The crystal dumplings did not hold as I picked it up. The soup in the Xiao Long Bao was bland. The black sesame fried rice lacked heat of the wok, what Cantonese calls "wok hei". It was more like fried rice by Caucasians overseas
5
Always feeling welcome and enjoying wonderful food and great service! Couldn't really find anything to have any complaint about. Fantastic
4
First the place - it is undoubtedly beautiful. The decor is sumptuous - but not exaggerated - with small details adding up to the elegance of this place, in a way that does not happen very often in the mix with Cantonese food.Now to the food - and here, one could write an entire essay. The food selection is quite abundant, with interesting choices for veggies, fish- and seafood-lovers, and carnivores alike. Wasabi-aioli prawns made the perfect appetizer, and then the fish fillets and the scallop dishes really took it to the next level (you can ask for the scallops to be served with asparagus instead of celery, works much better). Delicious and fragrant tea was served all along. One thing I was not very happy about - the wine selection is good, but it is irritating to chose from wines you know you can buy for a third of the menu price, without too much effort. Too obvious, and not up to the overall standard.Finally the ambience. By the look if it, especially at evening time, the place seems almost intimate - but instead, the atmosphere is a bit stiff. The place is actually better suited to host family gatherings or business groups, than romantic dinners for two. We had a business dinner party, and Cherry Garden was perfect for the occasion. Last but not least - the service was immaculate.Overall - highly recommended, but rather for more formal occasions
3
Their dishes are above average, dim sum are good. Service is good. However, none of the dishes are so good that I would give an a very good grading
5
We have had dinner at this restaurant a few times, and it has always been excellent. Providing some of the best Cantonese food we have tasted, this restaurant has an extensive menu, is well fitted out and, as you would expect for a Mandarin Oriental restaurant, the staff are excellent.
5
Food was superb and service was top-notch. The wait staff could anticipate what you need and proactively get it for you before you even ask for it. And whenever I tried to refill my tea cup (tea pot was on our table), they would rush to help do that for me. Will definitely revisit again! Thanks for the lovely experience!
5
We dine in for lunch without booking. It was really fully book day however Razzel assistant manager go for extra mile and she delighted is with beautiful smile and professional assistance. Phoebe was also another stunning staff all the time assisted us with prompt and right recommendation for dishes.Thank you very much for precious unforgettable and memorable lunch experience for this visit. I cannot wait to dining in again for future visit.

My first visit for the dim sum buffet was 2 years ago. I tried it again last Sunday and yup, my opinion still stands = very average dim sum buffet, not worth the money. Go elsewhere like Hai Tien Lo or Jian Nan Chun.The Good- Nice Char siew pao, har gow and siew mai. The traditional dim sum dishes are delicious- Nice ambienceThe Bad (which is why i won't be coming back)- Service , Sloooooowwwww.. There was only one guy who was allowed to take orders. If i asked any other staff that i would like one more basket of har gow, they say "sorry, please order from him". That guy was great, very friendly , polite..but there was only one of him , for the entire restaurant.. And to make it worse they had a 2 seating policy... I came for second seating which started at 1:30pm only to be told i only have until 2:45 to make all my orders.... so much for leisurely dim sum. It adds to the stress that i keep needing to remind the guy to come over (as he is too busy going table to table).Now if you are a total kiasu person who upon sitting down , orders 100 baskets of dimsum at one shot...then this wouldn't be a problem for you. But being a fine dining , relaxed sunday.. I prefer to just order a few baskets at a time... Impossible to do here.This was the same problem 2 years ago. Am surprised no improvement- Service (wait staff) : Lack of attention to detail. A for effort and politeness, but they would bring the tea, and take away the teapot...takes me 10 minutes to get the teapot back....they go around my table taking away the dirty plates, and replacing with new one...but somehow forgot to do that for one guest...again lots of waving to get the new plate. stuff like thatTakes them forever to deliver the food too, some dishes took over 30 minutes to arrive- Food quality : aside from the traditional dim sum, the rest is "meh".....they had LIVE prawns steamed in garlic, so says the menu... sounds good year? Well the prawns turned out TINY.,..cooking style was great, but wasn't worth the effort because the meat was so little.... The deserts were mostly too sweet and nothing to rememberSo overall i rate a poor due to the price.. If this was say a 30++ buffet, i would say wonderful. But it isn't, so there are much better choices of restaurants out there..

Had their Thought set menu at S$138++ per pax for our anniversary celebration. Food portions were sufficient. Delicately and freshly prepared. The Peking duck and golden pumpkin soup with morel mushroom (which gives a hint of truffle aroma) plus diced chicken stood out. The rest, though nice, were forgettable. Supposed to be a fine dining restaurant, but the ambience is somewhat spoilt by kids running around and squealing (as the menu caters also for family dining). Staff were nonetheless courteous and attentive. A red rose for my wife and a complimentary slice of red velvet cake for our anniversary was a pleasant and appreciated gesture
5
Service crew were very attentive and the dim sum is not to miss. A bit pricy, but it's worth it for the food, place and ambience. Great for a hangover cure (try the soup!
4
The service is superb at the Cherry Garden, they are extremely attentive and cant do enough for you. The restaurant has a lovely ambience and beautiful Chinese inspired interior. The food was great, extremely tasty and probably the best Chinese restaurant Ive been to.I would highly recommend this restaurant and if I ever go back to Singapore, will certainly be making another visit
4
Attentive service, nice food and good presentation. Good ambience, suit sle for family and business dinne
5
Came here for my birthday with the family. Reservation was easily made online and a follow-up call was made by the restaurant to enquire if this was a special occasion (they brought out a cake, a lovely touch!). We booked the first seating for the dim sum buffet (11am-1pm). At 11am, there were only 2-3 other tables occupied and service was friendly and very prompt. The staff were attentive, quickly replenishing our tea without having to ask and coming back to ask us if we wanted to order anything else. The food was of course, exquisite. I think you pay what you get for, really. There were one or two items we didn't enjoy but bearing in mind the huge variety available, this was forgivable. The 2-hour seating is more than sufficient to stuff yourselves silly and leave very satiated! Would definitely visit again
5
Wow great ambience. Very posh setting and the personnel very attentive and friendly. Professional in their attitude. Setting is very nice. China used very nice too. Had the VIP room with friends. Room is private, cosy and welcoming.Food is great... Cantonese cuisine. Really delicious. Quite expensive though but worth a visit if you are wanting great Cantonese food and very nice ambienceHappy eatin
5
after Arrival in singapore we decided to have a nice lunch with our 4 yo Girl. as she likes dim sum as well we went to the great a la carte dim sum brunch at cherry garden and liked it very much. the Food is great and the selection vast
5
Not your typical dim sum, everything at this restaurant goes above what you would expect from dim sum dishes. The buffet is cleverly done so that each person gets an individual piece and portions are coordinated with the number of people - you can safely book for two and expect to get the same spread as you would with many other people in your party. The deep fried escargot was sublime, their traditional dishes were presented with an extra touch of luxury at every turn: har gow with gold leaf, siu mai with baby abalone. You are paying for a mini banquet rather than dim sum. The service is honest and charming
4
The place is elegant and our dining experience was enjoyable.We loved the wasabi prawns, steam cod fish and duck.Dessert was good, we had the red bean pancake
4
Friday lunch and the restaurant was filled with the business crowd and a handful of families. With its elegant dining room and attentive service, this is what you would expect from a restaurant located in a Mandarin Oriental.We had fairly high expectations for our meal. The dim sum was well executed and nicely presented though not spectacular. They mostly stuck to a straightforward delivery of traditional dim sum dishes -this is a good thing. Where many high end Chinese restaurants slip up is with dessert - either trying on fusion-like concepts that don't work or serving up portions with parsimony. The deep fried pancake filled with red bean paste (a very traditional dessert) was served with an odd combination of green tea ice cream, fresh mango and strawberries and marshmallows (!). The hot almond cream was lovely though we were disappointed that at S$10 for a single serving they could only manage one tang yuan. We were also a little surprised that the restaurant only offers complementary parking for spend of S$500 or more (our meal came up to S$130).
5
Reservation made few days in advance as we wanted to tried the treasure pot. Specially arrange by the chef.Having lunch on the weekdays. Restaurant was almost full. with the main dining hall almost taken up. We were seated and greeted by Joy and Razzle with a corder with great day light view, overlooking suntec city. Amouse bouche was served, followed by appetizer. And of course the best of the best treasure pot. With lobster, abalone, pork belly, roasted duck, chinese sausages, fresh scallop, dried scallop, big prawn, steamed chicken, sea cucumber, homemade fish ball, brocolli, wolfberries, shrimp in beancurd skin, chinese white cabbage, shiitake mushroom and etc, cooked with the superior stock. accompanied with the delicious egg noodle was awesome. Portion was good enough for all of us. Excellent service from Cherry garden and great food from the chef. Thanks to Eve for arranging the special request menu, Razzle, Joy, Dong, Phone and rest of Cherry Garden staff that looks after us during the meal. Upon of time we were warm during the meal, we were offered ice water for all which was note expected, going beyond our expectation. NOthing but the best from Cherry Garde
5
Excellent service as the staffs were very friendly and courteous to us.The food were decorated exquisitely, it certainly brings out the uniqueness and flavor of each dish.I would recommend the Dim-Sum Brunch as it have lots of delicious dishes such as Wasabi Prawns,BBQ Combination and Yin-Yang Fried Rice
5
High quality food prepared by excellent chefs, atmosphere was nice and relaxing, staffs were very approachable and had very high customer service levels. I recommend this place to visit if you plan to have a family gathering or celebration
5
The dim sum here is a set fee ($90) but you still order from a menu rather than a buffet. We arrived when the restaurant was opening and the service was fast, friendly and efficient. Although busy, the atmosphere was calm and laid back. The food here is excellent, every dish that we tried. Overall a great place to go if you want to spoil yourself as it is not chea
5
As I only have the chance to eat here once a year I was determined for my second visit to make the most of it. The surroundings were as I remembered charming and thoroughly Chinese. I explained to Dong my waiter that I had made some selections from the Cantonese Menu and discussed my appetite. He suggested dropping a course and switching one to make it more balanced and his advice was first rate. The signature Wasabi-Aioli Prawns were outstanding and I then moved in steamed wok vegetables perfectly cooked full of taste and crunch with the Steamed Cod Fillet in a home made Soya Sauce which was delicious. Dong's white wine choice cut though the dazzling oriental flavours and the Chinese Tea acted as a palette refresher through out. My heart felt thanks to Dong who has a great future with his superb people skills and Sam NG who oversaw everything with style and charm. A wonderful evening of Cantonese cooking
5
We dined at the Cherry Garden in 2014 and had the Peking Duck that we remembered as being lip smacking good so we planned on having Peking Duck again and it did not disappoint.The service and food was as we remembered
4
This probably is the most expensive and so far one of the best dim sum i had in Singapore. It costs me almost $90 with all service and tax included. This is buffet high tea dim sum. There isn't intensive selection of dim sum. there are also some other ala-carte chinese dishes for your choices.Environment - very nice and quiet(the time when I was there, the restaurant not full). Suitable for gatheringService - very very good service, from start till end. All trained to be polite, helpful and the best is always with smile on their faces. Food - very nice, at least the food that i ordered, 90% I am very satisfy with it.Price - very pricey but with good service and food, it is worth to try once in a blue moo
5
Went to Cherry Garden for lunch dim sum buffet with my family and the food was excellent with good service. The restaurant doesn't have much of a view and the larger tables in the front have large family gathering. If you prefer a quieter setting I suggest you ask the waitress to seat you in the back. The dim sum were high quality and delicious. One of the best dim sum restaurants I've been to for sure and will go back next time in Singapore
5
We went to have Sunday brunch there. There are 2 settings, one at 11:30 to 1 pm and the other from 1:30 to 3 pm. The restaurant is inside Mandarin Oriental Hotel and decorated in Chinese rural style with bamboos and plants outside. It has a nice, cosy atmosphere. The service is very good. The head waitress is always smiling and make you feel very welcomed.The brunch is S$68 ++ but you can eat all the dishes in their lunch menu which includes dim sum, soups, meat and vegetable dishes, rice and noodles and deserts. There are many choices and they are interesting and creative. Food was excellent. We had a wonderful meal and we will return

The restaurant can give you a traditional Chinese environment for dining. The food menu has quite a large range of choices. So if you are looking for a fine dining place to celebrate or special occasion, it is a very good choice.I've chosen it to have a pre-birthday dinner for my boyfriend, who loves seafood a lot. He quite like the food over there
5
As far as reviews go they're biased to a certain extent. And given that I've only had dim sum here and not its other dishes, I can only comment about its dim sum, which are excellent and possibly the best in Singapore. Its ambiance and service are also unparalleled
5
Stayed for dinner with my wife and a friend. The Peking duck was the best i had in a long time. Service was very professional and friendly. Highly recommended
4
Had a quick dinner here with a colleague and the taste and service was very good. The chillie chicken with cashew nuts was the best I have had anywhere. The chicken was tender and cooked to perfection. The asparagus with garlic for me could have been cooked with asparagus that was more tender. Full marks for the hot and sour soup. Will go again
5
I would really like to contact the mandrin oriental f&b director personally by email or anything. Cant express how proud i am of him. :) keep it up etienne francois <3 and of course the team! The food and service was a top notch! <3 make sure to try their dim sum! Yummy!

went on my birthday, they bless me a complimentary cake, awesome! just remember to ask them, and it would be given : ) 
5
I really don't know what to say to express my experience from this restaurant!! The atmosphere, the service and the food were simply amazing! As we really couldn't decide on what to choose from the menu we left it to the lady servicing us. Each plate was an experience on its own. They didn't took advantage of it and they didn't bring us more than we could and should eat just to get the bill higher!! Everything was as it should be and all in all they gave us such an experience that we want to return to Singapore only to experience it one more time. Thank you Cherry Garden for that

Excellent place to enjoy with family, friends, or with your couple in Singapore. Book in advance and enjoy. Great dim-sum and lovely pork belly made with special recipe. Don't miss it.
5
I've always liked the restaurants and quality you get in Mandarin Oriental hotels and this one did not disappoint.I visited for dim sum brunch and at S$68++ it's a very good deal. Unlimited dishes with a good sized menu from Kurobuta pork to excellently soft chicken feet and dim sum.The food was all well done and the service very good too.I will be visiting again
5
Weekend Dim Sum Buffet at the Mandarin is a MUST! The food kept coming. The spread is equally grand. We were not disappointed at all. Do not forget to make timely reservation
5
Every visit to Singapore must start with Dim sums @ Cherry Garden, if you are lucky and it's the weekend, indulge yourself with the Ruinard all you can eat Dim sums menu which waters my mouth just by writing about it. Go Go GO

Cherry Garden gave us a nice quiet table as requested for my mother's birthday. Service was prompt, attentive and informative. We were surprised with another cake, complimentary of the restaurant, for my mom at the end of the dinner. We enjoyed the food and ambience very much
5
Excellent Cantonese cuisine - this restaurant can mix traditional Cantonese cuisine with some fusion elements (ie foie gras). Beautiful dishes, very nice setting - the hotel looks marvellous and inviting.
4
Great place for business lunch. Price is on the higher side but you get good quality food, great service and nice environment.
5
Had our anniversary dinner at Cherry Garden. And I would definitely agree that this is one of the warmest experiences we had encountered. Not only the dishes were absolutely fantastic, we were hosted well by the waitresses! Ambience wise is really quiet and classy, not your typical chinese restaurant. Service was prompt and friendly. I would recommend the oven-baked honey marinated cod fillet and sauteed beef tenderloin cubes which totally melt upon your taste buds! Best cod and beef we had ever tasted. A tad pricier than above average restaurants but no regrets! Special requests were well taken care of unlike most places where they either say they try their best to adhere or whichever. Complimentary desserts on the house too! I will be bringing my parents there, because it's totally worth it. You should experience it too
5
Top notch Dim Sum.We were lucky to get the last table for the 2nd sitting on a Sunday.This is top quality stuff, including the service. Not cheap though & not quite as good as their sister Hotel in Bangkok.Best that we found in S'pore. Next best was Red Star but that's on a different level.Worth it for a treat
5
The thought of this place makes my mouth water. Came here with my boyfriend the first time around, and visited the second time with friends. We enjoyed the Dim Sum buffet and had to pretty much get lifted out of the place due to food coma. Reminds me I need to visit ASAP!
4
Being a tourist in a foreign country can be hard. However, the members of staff at Cherry Garden explained what was an 'appropriate amount' of food which is really helpful as we didn't know howmany dishes to order! The food was incredible...The Peking Duck was better than any English Chinese take-away! Good selection of drinks but the drinks were expensive (like many things in Singapore once the taxes are added on) Would definitely recommend.
4
This restaurant is quite small given that it is in the Mandarin Oriental hotel. Therefore reservations are a must, especially for lunch as it is popular with the business crowd. The service was excellent, and the food was innovative and unusual. Expensive but worth a visit
5
First time visit to the Cherry Garden this week. We opted for the lunchtime buffet which was priced $68 ++ which is not cheap, BUT you get what you pay for. Staff are very well trained and you don't need to search for help as the waiters are allocated to the tables. Service was excellent. Now for the food. The menu is a melody of Cantonese cuisine. Our favorite being the wasabi prawns and the pork belly. Delicious. We opted for the 1:30 to 3:00 sitting which with the speed of service was fine. Loved it
5
My wife booked this restaurant for my birthday. From the moment we entered the restaurant and shown to our table by our lovely host we were welcomed by all staff in the restaurant. Our main waiter James was extremely friendly and showed the utmost in professionalism. He assisted with our food selections and made sure we ordered just enough to satisfy our needs. The food is absolutely exquisite albeit a bit expensive. The Wasabi Prawns, a house speciality are to die for. A great night all round with fantastic service and excellent food. Well done to all there
4
We had just flown in from Sydney. Did not what to go far, had not used the Cherry Garden on any of the previous visits, because Singapore is awash in choice.Staff exceptional, friendly and helpful.Food fresh and exceptional quality and a very good price point
5
One of my all time favorite dim sum places. Been there many times. Attracted to their dim sum ala carte buffet. They serve different dim sum compared to the traditional ones. Very very yummy! Love it! Worth it!!
3
Supposedly the best dim sum in Singapore, but I have doubts. Nonetheless, it's a nice restaurant for dim sum. Good for families and groups. They have an all-you-can-eat Sunday lunch; get there for the first seating and order as many dishes as you want!
5
Booked here for my husband's birthday. The dim sum buffet is divine. Best dim sum I've ever had. Fantastic service. Beautiful restaurant. I had a MO Boston martini. Now my favourite drink.
4
We enjoy a good Peking Duck. The Duck at the Cherry Gardens was I thought a bit fatty. We eat it with pancakes & then with rice. The fried rice was good. Not deterred we dinned there a second time & during our stay in Singapore & tried other menu items. The steamed crayfish with soy & ginger was excellent . Also the sweet & sour fish & the Spicy squid. Like most restaurant's in 5 star hotels the alcohol was expensive . But S$30 for mineral water & another S30 for a chin doe beer I thought was a little out there. The staff good & helpful. Atmosphere also good
5
My parents and I tried the dim sum a la carte buffet brunch at Mandarin Oriental hotel's Cherry Garden restaurant. We took the 11am seating. Starting with seafood and chef's recommendations, we were wowed by their tender beef tendon and five spice Wagyu Beef: both had tasty sauce and slow cooked to perfection. The roast duck was also tender and the skin was crispy. The chicken with shaoxing rice wine was also tender and flavourful. The dim sum were even more fantastic! I especially loved their prawn Dumpling Har Gau and abalone siew mai. But thank goodness we left room for their desserts! My favourite was the Cherry Blossom lychee sorbet and osmanthus cake. What a lovely way to spend an afternoon!
5
We went there for Sunday Brunch a couple of months ago. It was surprisingly very nice.The Dim-Sum selection was quite different from the usual offerings & some of the side dishes were amazing. The desserts were also done with such uniqueness but unfortunately, we could no longer fill ourselves with more.Service was also very attentive & the staff were always on hand to assist or clear our plates.Recommended for a quiet family Sunday brunch
5
A really excellent Chinese restaurant, though not quite as good as it's counterpart in the Pan Pacific, Hai Tien Lo.However, it was a really good meal even though we had to move as the initial seat we were offered didn't seem to provide any cooling air though the other table was fine. We saw other guests asking to move so the air con seems a bit variable.The food was fine and service good
3
Arrived without a booking (tip - book a table at the weekend) and was frowned upon. When seated was told I was lucky to get the last table. Hour & a half later there were still empty tables when we left.Service was very poor given it wasn't full and again it felt like the staff were doing us a favour. At one point plates were cleared whilst we were still eating. Price of the food is way over what you would expect to pay for Chinese restaurant even in a hotel. Not sure I would visit again.
4
Was here for the dim sum brunch during the weekend. We did not expect to be served portions of the entire menu and were surprised when told so by the staff. We did however manage to remove items that we were certain we did not want. On hindsight, after having had more than enough food, we should have just chosen the items that we really wanted to try. Overall we thought that the price charged was very reasonable for the quantity and quality of food as well as the generally good service we received. Service could have been a bit more attentive. Given the number of dishes, I felt that we needed more frequent change of plates. But the service staff were doing the best they could. Overall I must say that having been to almost all of Mandarin Oriental's (Singapore) dining establishments, they do seem sincere in wanting to serve their customers well
5
This was by far the best restaurant we ate at during our honeymoon. The food was outstanding, we had some minced/shredded chicken which we had never heard or tried before and it was amazing. The same goes for some assortment of mushrooms that were exquisite. The Peking duck was extraordinary. Truly a must!
3
Don't get me wrong. This is a good restaurant, and a stylish one too, but when you dine at the Mandarin Oriental, and pay their prices, you do expect something Special in terms of food and service. Sad to say, the Cherry Garden didn't deliver.
5
If you like Cantonese food this is a wonderful restaurant. Perfect service and a lovely serene atmosphere. See more on my review of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel where this restaurant is situated.
4
Came here with family for the weekend a la carte buffet. For $68 per person, you can order unlimited amounts of dishes from the menu. It's fantastic value if you can eat a lot. If not, well, enjoy the food quality and ambience. Plenty of light here as there are floor to ceiling windows , with a garden feelOrdered their specials . Dim sum included fried carrot cake and crispy mango rolls. Both good. Ordered a string bean vegetable dish and it was too salty. Out of 6 of us, 3 ordered soups and when they arrived, the waitress just asked "so who ordered the soup?". If this was din tai fung , that's fine, but not when it's mandarin oriental. The mixed roast meat platter was good, as was the fried vermicelliWe ordered 2 desserts to share and they were tiny. That was ok as we were stuffe
5
Revisited again with my friends and an early celebration dinner. Made the reservation 1 day in advance for a special menu, special thanks to Eve and the chef the specially createtd the menu for us. Restaurant was a bit apck on a weekdays night most of the dining area table were occupied. Nicholas seated us and chinese tea was offered. Our Food timing was just nice after a little chitchat. Treasurepot definetely the best in the world. where my fried keep praise, and happy to see my all my friend enjoying the meal.Although the restaurant was busy but the service standard remains high. Our tea and beverage was constantly refilled and dirty plates was clear immeditely.Thanks for Nicholas and team with a memorabble dining experienc
4
I cannot fault the food just the quantity. Simply too much of everything AND we ordered the small portions! Char Sui Pork perfect with a minimum of sauce Cherry Wood roasted duck excellent with no fat. Broccoli with black bean says crunchy! And the surprise of the evening French beans wok stirred with pork and shrimp a must order. Wine list expensive. Service staff struggled in English so many orders had to be repeated to the manager who was all over. Very family oriented with loads of large table
4
Came here with friends and had the set menu dinner that was on offer. As soon as we entered the restaurant we were greeted with a warm welcome. Our server Joy Aninta really looked after us and made us feel welcomed. She has a good knowledge of the menu and gave us a good recommendation of the food according to our preference. Nice sized portion and very good food. We felt that the service was very personalized and Joy was very attentive to our needs throughout the whole evening. Overall we had a great night and we were so full afterrads. Will definitely come back again and will recommend to friends because of the outstanding service received. Well done Joy and keep up the good work
5
We visit Singapore often and always have one meal at the Cherry Garden Restaurant at the Marina Oriental Hotel. Looking at other reviews on TripAdvisor we worry about the number of people reporting a bad or mediocre experience, especially given the premium prices charged.Last night we had a superb dining experience, on a par with a Michelen Star restaurant. The quality of the food was exceptional, each dish beautifully presented and the taste experience was memorable. There was meticulous attention to dietary restrictions, making sure that each dish met our requirements. The wines are very confidently priced but the bottle of Champagne we ordered arrived at just the right temperature and was kept at that temperature throughout the meal.Service was meticulous but not intrusive and we left with a firm intention to visit again when next in Singapore.David

We needed a restaurant for a Sunday dim sum brunch before departing for the airport. We had seven pieces of luggage to store and knew that it was too much to take into a restaurant so we decided a hotel would be just the thing. Looked up their menu on line and it seemed adequate. The room is serene, our service was efficient and their dim sum was served artistically. Each plate was a feast for the eyes. Most of what we had was delicious. The only dish that I wouldn't recommend is the "drunken chicken.
1
We booked the restaurant by recommendation of our concierge. We were looking forward to a nice cantonese dinner. We arrived to the restaurant and everything was ok. We were seated and immediately given the menus, we felt pushed to hurry even though the restaurant was empty. We ordered two appetizers and the waiter couldn't recommend or explain anything, he could barely speak English. We ordered a vegetable entree and was completely horrible, it was refrigerator cold and nobody in the restaurant could explain what it was, the waiter kept saying that it was not vegetable even though that was the name of the dish. We quickly ordered the appetizer beef with spices, several minutes later it arrived. It was several beef slices, hamburger think and completely raw. We could have had a chainsaw for mouth and still we couldn't have chewed on it. Our Pekin duck arrived almost at the same time as the appetizers, it was delicious. We ate the 2 crepes we were given and were left with a plate full of duck slices and no way of eating it. We asked for more plum sauce and after asking several times the manager brought us a bowl filled to the very top and threw it on the table. It felt like a shut up.Our fried rice arrived and it was completely uneatable, any fast food joint has better rice than this oily tasteless uneven frozen "rice". The manager attended our table since the first appetizer but was always with a tired, disapproving and rude look on her face towards us, as if we were being too much trouble.All of this happened y about 20 minutes, we didn't eat anything except two Pekin duck crepes but were still charged for everything.The restaurant is very beautiful but the people are un-charistmatic and food is tasteless and horrible. We had a terrible experience.Do not eat here.
5
We went here for lunch. Had several appetisers and also main course. Great kung pao chicken, great dim sums. There are 3 portion sizes, small, medium and large, but actually the small ones are enough for two people. Good house tea.The restaurant decor is beautiful.Service very good
3
for a Mandarin Oriental Restaurant !
Average food, average to poor service (but with a lot of attitude). Outdated interior decoration.
A tourist-trap. We would never take our visiting friends there . . .
5
Luxurious cantonese restaurant in luxurious hotel. Top old-chinese atmosphere with delicious fine dining. The perfect Hongkong style steam fish, the best of the best roasted pork belly etc. It is a high-class dining experience and best suit for family or business treat ...
3
My first visit to this restaurant. The ambience of the restaurant is great. The menu is very Cantonese, no surprises there. The food quality was what I expected given the high prices. However, service was disappointing. They didn't notice a guest was not given a cutlery set and the guest had to point this out when the food started to arrive, much to the embarrassment of the host! They then provided the cutlery set but forgot the tea cup! Once again the guest had to ask for it in the middle of the meal. I saw there were other reviews about the lower than satisfactory service level too, and I hope the restaurant would act on the feedback
5
We have been going to Cherry Garden Restaurant at Mandarin Oriental, Singapore for a long time. A few days ago, to celebrate our wedding anniversary we decided to go there as it is one of our favourite restaurants. We already started feeling pampered as the staff escorted us to a table decorated with rose petals in the shape of a heart. Started our dinner with our all time favourite Wasabi Prawns with Mango.Then came the Hot and Sour Seafood Soup which was delicious as usual. Lobster with Truffle was the next course and it was beautifully done. Char Siew (sweet fried pork) and Scallop Fried Rice came last. Dessert was Avacado Cream with Walnut Ice cream.Food was excellent but service was even better. Very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly staff! Ambience was wonderful, as usual. We could not have selected a better place to celebrate our special day
4
Weekend dim sum brunch here is as good as it get i.e. on par with any of the other famous dim sums you can think of. Ambiance here is excellent to give you a comfy feel. Do try out their crispy wasabi-aioli prawns with fresh mango and roe
5
I visited this restaurant with my colleagues on a business trip to Singapore and liked the place very much. The ambience of the restaurant is very nice and the staff are very friendly and helpful. We had a nice dinner based on the food recommendation of the manager and it was excellent.Look forward to visit this restaurant in future
2
We went to Cherry Garden for dinner and whilst we were expecting premium pricing - the service and food were disappointing.Our starter arrived but then within 5 minutes our main course also arrived. My husband requested they take the main courses back whilst we finish our starter.The main course came out and it was COLD...same food and not even kept warm. For the reputation and standards this hotel strives for - it came as a huge let down.I suggest other restaurants for this price and we wont be returning to this restaurant
3
For an expensive restaurant the level of service was average to disappointing and the quality of the food similar. Overall this is nothing like the standard of restaurants in the Bangkok and Hong Kong Oriental hotels. The setting though is nice but Singapore has many better places to go - and even for Singapore, the Cherry Garden is expensive
5
We went there with a friend and it was a great experience. The decor is really nice as well as the service. We tried the Peking duck and the roasted duck, they are both excellent. The black pepper beef is amazing too. We enjoyed our time there and will definitely go back.
4
This is my first time to dine in cherry garden. The interior is nice but light abit dim. Good customer service as the waitress keep asking you if the food is ok or whether you have any food allergy etc.We ordered wasabi prawn, bbq platter, assorted vegetables, rice and softdrinks.The wasabi prawns and the bbq platter are very nice..prawns are fresh; the meat skin on the bbq platter is very crispy. Worth eating dish.But for the assorted vegetables, i find it not worth to order that as it taste average only. Somemore it costs about sgd$22, abit expensive.The soft drink is super expensive which costs me sgd$8 per glasss. It is a mistake to order soft drink in chinese restaurant.Overall, the experience is nice and pleasant. Can consider to dine here again in future
5
The food at this restaurant is simply delicious. Moreover, the interior is very nice and the staff very friendly.
4
I am very pleased with the service & thoughtfulness applied with it. Please expand the dim sum menu!
4
I held a business dinner here recently. I'd previously had lunch some time back and the food was always good. The service was efficient. We picked one of the set dinners which was good value overall given the quantity of food. Overall a reliable choice.
5
Well worth a visit.
The ambience was excellent - except that the CD was playing on loop.
Service was great - staff were intuitive and polite. Ever willing to please.
Food was by far the best amongst many Chinese restaurants in Singapore.
3
I cannot fault the food here, the chef is to be commended but I have never eaten a meal so fast in my life!! Our booking was for 7.30pm by 8.30pm it was all over, all 5 courses were done. We tried to tell the staff to slow down a little so we could at least finish our bottle of wine. I felt sick when I got back to my room. Suspect this is a 'churn em and burn em' type of place with high turnover for business meetings. Won't return next time
4
Cherry garden focuses a lot on recreating the experience for the customers; to be part of dining in a dynasty palace. I liked the decorations and architecture very much, they already caught my attention as I was walking towards cherry garden from the lift lobby. The ala carte dim sum buffet served small but exquisitely tasty dim sum, I basically ate all which are being recommended. Unfortunately, I wished they had a variety of choices for the Chinese tea to go with the dim sum, personally I am for tie guan yin, but they only had "Chinese tea"
4
Amazing attentive service, although restaurant was quiet. Every dish of the tasting menu was delicious. Very flexible on food choices in the tasting menu so we were able to mix and match. Not cheap but a lovely evening and make sure you pop out to the open bar and get some photos of marina bay
5
The Cherry Garden is on our list of fine dining in Singapore. This visit was up to the usual high standard. The food was excellent with an eye to detail eg asking about any dietary restrictions (and acting on the advice given), discussing the order and timing of serving dishes and being concerned that the champagne ordered was of the right temperature.The service is attentive without being oppressive and the ambience and decor make for a fine dining experience. Unless you are staying at the Mandarin Oriental hotel or arrive by car/taxi the pedestrian access is a bit challenging. The only way to get to the hotel from the Marina Square shopping complex is via a set of dingy stairs or via the car-park. Access to the Pan Pacific hotel from Marina Square is easy, but access to both the Marina Mandarin and the Mandarin Oriental is a bit challenging for people who struggle with stairs.All in all the best meal we had in Singapore this stay.David 
5
We had a great business meeting and the food was very good. We had the peking duck, the wasabi shrimp, 3 different dim sums, the lobsters. The staff did a great job serving the food and kept the courses flowing in a perfect flow. Great job!!Another one for the repeat list.
5
My husband and I had just arrived and checked into the Mandarin for our honeymoon and being late we decided to eat at the Cherry Garden, We chose the taster menu (6 courses) with some jasmine tea as recommended by the waitress. The food was not what we were used too but I love to try new things while away and encouraged my not so adventurous husband to join me. We both loved it, (maybe not the jellyfish) but everything else was fab and it was really good fun to watch each other try these new and exciting dishes. The tea was a great suggestion really helped with the digestion so we will be taking that idea home. The best part of there exceptional service was as I had not yet adjusted to the strength of the air conditioning i was feeling a little chilly. With our room just upstairs my husband went to go grab a light jacket for me. The Waitress stopped him before he left, with a no need sir we have this for your wife and brought over a beautiful silk and cashmere wrap for me to borrow (also in a colour that complemented my outfit). Now that's service!Its a lovely restaurant, a little expensive but look at where you are. Private rooms available too for larger groups and parties
4
We were a table of three for lunch.
Friendly and professionnal service.Food was excellent but portions on the smaller side.Price is in line with the food and location.Will be back.
4
High quality dining experience, with great service. Food was very good, although certainly comes with the price tag to match. Well looked after though for a birthday dinner, including a birthday cake on the house.
5
The restaurant is an oasis of calm and elegance in a huge juggernaut of a hotel. From the moment you enter you're in an intimate setting a world away. Greeting staff, as you would expect are charming and efficient, as are all the waiting staff. Joy, our waitress, really lived up to her name and is an asset to the restaurant. Food was exemplary in both taste and presentation, particularly the wasabi, mayo prawns and the cubed beef in black bean sauce. I mentioned that my husband loved crispy duck but wouldn't order a full portion just for one person. Joy immediately brought out 4 delicate duck pancakes for him. She also arranged for an item from the fixed vegetarian menu to be provided to us as an accompaniment to our meal.All in all this was the best food we enjoyed in our stay in Singapore and we ate in all the top hotels
4
Arrived very late and close to closing time but was greeted correctly by the staff who were helpful and polite but I sensed that naturally enough they were keen to close. Notwithstanding that they attended my needs. On there suggestion (to save time) I ate my chosen first course after my chosen second course. They offered me expensive imported bottled water rather than tap water.. Food was enjoyable and of a high standard
5
Best dimsums i have tasted for a long while The atmosphere is certainly Zen and the service is second to noneit was a business meet so the menu was rather confined to what the boss wanted us to have but hey he made some good choices !!super meal. thank yo
4
We had a dinner at cherry garden and this is a type of a place where you should come with a bigger group and share your meals. Portions are very big and even smallest will be quite big, although rice portions are not that big. Loved scallops with mushrooms and celery. Very nice and delicious food and adapted to European taste. Was so full that couldn't even try the desert. So leave some space if you want to go for a dessert also!

For more images and review please visit: http://rygohxx.blogspot.sg/2014/08/cherry-garden-mandarin-oriental-hotel.htmlCherry Garden (Cantonese Cuisine) presented with artistic modern flair located at Mandarin Oriental Hotel near Marina Square. I totally like the place especially their services, environment and of course the foods. Over at there,we ordered Cherry Gardenâ€™s charcoal-roasted BBQ meat platter, Prawn Duet, Sweet and sour Kurobuta pork with pineapple, cucumber and capsicum, Braised homemade tofu with monkey head mushrooms with green vegetables and soups
5
Everytime we travel to Singapore, this is a must-visit. I just love Cherry Garden. Try their rice turnover, wasabi prawns and crispy pork.You can't go wrong with any dimsum that you order from the menu. Also, food is good for sharing. It might be a little expensive to most tourists but the quality of the food and the ambiance makes up for it.Reservation is a must

I just had my birthday lunch with family last weekend. We ordered what we want from the menu. The food arrived in good time. We loved the "Black BBQ Pork Char Siew" and ordered another. The food took a long long time. And when it arrived, it was completely different from the first serving. In fact, it looked odd. Nothing liked the first serving. It was a quarter portion of the first in a small small dish. I clarified with the manager (without a name tag), a guy that I understood to be of british, thai and filipino descent. He was defensive and evasive. His attitude was on downright rude. When it finally arrived after we asked why it took forever to serve our second order, it was still nothing liked the first. We gave up. We could only conclude, for $XXX dollars, there is only so much you can order. There is a "limit" to some items you can order. Two hours is allowed per sitting means nothing when the restaurant controlled when food were to be served and how much per portion to be served per table. That to me, is not a buffet at all. We are totally disgusted with the way the restaurant resorted to such a under-handed manner of operation - totally unethical!! No recommendation from us! Take your money elsewhere!!
5
Visited this restaurant on more than one occasion during a week's business trip. The manager assisted me with my food choices and made great recommendations. There's a good bar downstairs where you can enjoy some fabulous cocktails, on a Friday they're half price. Overall great value with exceptional service. What a beautiful hotel
5
If you like Catonese Food this is the place and you don't even have to leave the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.he atmosphere, wine, food and staff are first rate.

Cherry garden restaurant benefits from an outstanding environment and a wonderful team in the cuisine that deliver a real great menu with authentic dishes. Excellent dessert with pistaccio, soja surrounded by a nice setup made of nitrogen. Excellent service, very fine moment.

In the past I've often been a little reluctant to try hotel restaurants especially, for some strange reason, in the same hotel I'm staying. Having dined at Cherry Garden I need not have had any concerns. The welcome you get from the maitre d' when first entering the restaurant is very warm and there is a buzz from the diners (certainly at the time we went). As you'd expect the decor is tasteful, the tables well spaced and the whole place has a quality feel.As for the menu, it's extensive and the set meals have great variety. The food doesn't disappoint either.I'm typically not price sensitive; if the food is basic but inexpensive I'll rate it highly, if it's genuine haute cuisine but expnsive I'll also rate it highly. My sense is that Cherry Garden is priced at the top end of what it's worth and I say that in the context of the high prices for up-scale restaurants in Singapore generally.Small touches were also good, like for example the restaurant manager taking the time to talk to us at the table between courses, offering to replace a course my daughter didn't like and giving my wife and daughter a rose each as they left.In conclusion, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and it was worht the price paid (just)
5
We had the dim sum buffet at Cherry Garden. There's a good range of dishes on the buffet to choose, although probably not too much if you're vegetarian. I don't usually like fried dim sum but the batter was always kept tasty and light! I especially recommend the roast pork, char siu and custard buns. The decor and setting is that of a Chinese garden and is certainly something different from other restaurants. Despite being quite busy, the staff remained attentive and very pleasant throughout our meal. Certainly not a cheap meal at $68++ per person, but is definitely worth it for a special occasion
5
It was a Sunday dinner with my family. Make a reservation few days back with their new set meal, I had their treasure pot which consist of total 18 ingredient. This set meal need at least 6 hours advance booking for the chef to prepare as all 18 premium ingredient inside the pot. We were greeted by the hottest Joy and Nicholas which direct us to our seats. Beverage was offered immediately. Food was served within 10 mins since we already per-ordered our set meals. First was appetizer follow by the huge pot of treasure pot. We were WoW by the size of the pot and the ingredient within. The taste was excellent. Food was not too salty as my parent commented that most of the treasure pot were too salty compare to what they taste in cherry garden. We could not finish the treasure pot, while about to end the servers served us noodle, which we could even finish our treasure pot. But the noodle was awesome, although we were bloated but the we manage to finish the heavenly taste of the noodle. The noodle was a simple dish, noodle cook with broth with some vegetable, but the taste of the noodle is what in my life I never tried before.And finally dessert.Food was excellent, glad that everyone give a thumbs up for this dinner.Service undoubtedly 5 star, special thanks to Dylis, Nicholas, Joy and Kama

Went to this place for a Sunday Dim Sum buffet with my wife and friends.The food was good for a buffet. The prawn dumplings were fresh and crunchy.We especially love the char siew- roast pork. It was tender and so sweetly marinated. It;s worth coming back for this alone.We ordered the ala carte buffet which was a free flow quantity of meat dumplings, steamed buns and many many other choices.I would have given this place a higher rating had it not been for poor service. Throughout the meal, we felt we were mostly ignored and it was very hard to get the attention of the staff to refill the tea pot.I will come back again. But I may not have the high expectation I had when I first came..

The atmosphere at Cherry Garden is quite elegant, but not stuffy. The food is superb. We took our waitress' recommendation and ordered the wasabi shrimp appetizer, which was memorable. Absolutely delicious! My meal (cod) was perfectly prepared, delicate and flavorful. My husband also enjoyed his meal. Would not hesitate to recommend Cherry Garden.
5
We arrived late for lunch, but nevertheless were given a generous and hospitable welcome, and moved on with two glasses of wine as apéro - as everywhere else in Singapore, wine does not come cheap, but both the Sancerre and the NZ Sauvignon Blanc were of excellent quality, We chose the Narcissus menu and moved on to Yasmin tea during lunch. For SGD60 ++ pp this included: exquisite dim-sum, a strong duck consomé, scallops with green asparagus, a gorgeous piece of cod in an even more gorgeous sauce, Singapore noodles and a surprising dessert of beancurd and sesame sorbet with a touch of molecular cuisine. Service was gentle and anticipatory throughout. We have ten more days left in Singapore and intend to go back for dinner
4
Diners ordered the items and these are freshly cooked :). One may order as one needs so there is little wastage of food :). The ingredients for the dim-sums are fresh and cooked just right, not hard as in overcooked or prepared well in advance. Special mention: wasabi prawns dish, steam prawn dumpling, duck and some dishes.The restaurant has a dark sleepy setting. Service is very good. Price per person is a bit steep
4
High end eat all you can dim sum restaurant. Although you order a la carte, you can have as much as you like for a fixed price all inclusive meal. The food is good, although I sometimes wish the chef would just do plain dim sum and not play around with some classic dishes.Very good. Would come agai
5
A superb meal, the Fish Dishes including the Shrimps and Lobster are worth trying, the Pate is exceptional and the Steak was outstanding. One of the best Mushroom Soups we have tasted and the Deserts brilliant
3
Had hoped that a Chinese restaurant in Singapore would have been excellent but very similar to the cuisine that we eat in our local Chinese restaurant. Will give this a miss next time !
3
The wasabi prawns at the is place are amazing!! As was the roast duck. Unfortunately the waitress missed someone when pouring an expensive bottle of champagne to our group of 9 which was a shame. But otherwise a pleasant experience and convenient if you are staying in the hotel.
5
We were overwhelmed buy the gentle and courteous attention as we tried to work out which dish was which! Not like our usual Chinese Take Away in Queensland. (it will never be the same again) We ordered duck pancakes and the young lady took charge of rolling these for us, and of course made it look so much nicer than if I had tried to do it.Lots of wonderful Chinese tea, and again that lovely gentle service.We wanted to take the whole group home with us!!!A red rose on leaving, and memories to stay with us for a long long time
1
The food is at best mediocre. The service was poor. The waiter who took our orders kept disappearing while I was speaking to him! The table felt dirty and stank of stale food. There were 4 of us but the dim sum came in 3s. Either one of us had to go without or we would order too much and waste food. No choice of tea - tea was lousy quality - did not compliment food. We were not offered hot towels - strange for a upmarket Chinese restaurant. We had the Sunday dim sum - overpriced for the lousy experience. Hotel is beautiful. There were few diners at that time. I would not repeat the experience
4
We booked a table for dinner during the Chinese New Year weekend and we only had a choice of two set menus.The place as you can imagine was packed and we were given a table near the entrance which was not exactly what we were hopping for when we made the reservation.The staff was helpful but obviously rushed of their feet.The food was good with some excellent dishes which shows that you are at a top establishment but again not what we were hoping for.We would go again but only for a normal meal which we had before and it was excellent
5
Make a reservation!We asked for recommendations and were not disappointed. The food is beautifully presented and had great flavor.We especially enjoyed the Peking Duck. When you make a reservation tell them that you would like Peking Duck so you are not disappointed.The scallop appetizer just melted in your mouth.I'd like to comment on other menu items, but don't remember the names.Don't be afraid to try the Chinese Cabernet Sauvignon as it was rather good.For a better dining experience dine on the early side as the restaurant is quite busy around 8 pm.Compliments to the Chef's and all of the service staff as all was outstanding. A true dining experience
5
As annual visitors to Singapore, we try out top restaurants. Cherry Garden did not disappoint! The menu was so extensive, 14 pages worth! No selection was over looked. We were over fed if anything, and the chef even recommended we order a smaller serve of one dish because it would have been too much in his opinion. This told me that the restaurant was serious about how its diners found their overall experience which impressed us. The half peking duck was sliced off the bone in front of us and made into the most delicious duck panckes I have ever eaten. Everything was wonderful and it was an unforgetable and very special meal. We will return! Well done Cherry Garden. If you get time, have a cocktail on the level 5 bar beforehand which overlooks the entire city and is outside near the pool. It's a beautifully romantic and breath-taking spot that really puts you in the mood!

One of the best, if not, the best dim sum I've ever had anywhere. And I been to many. Went for the Sunday Dim Sum brunch (about S$68 per person), which is more than usual, but this is no average dim sum restaurant. Service, Food, and Ambiance were all top notch
5
This is probably the best dim sum place in Singapore. We came here for the S$104 (S$88++) per head dim sum buffet on Christmas Day, and we enjoyed a wonderful gastronomic experience. The service is elegant and attentive - not overly pretentious, decoration is oriental and tasteful, the ambience is clam and relaxing, the food is superior in quality of the ingredient, craftsmanship and presentation - a treat for all senses. You could sit at the table comfortably and order unlimited items from the menu. Besides dim sum, It has soup & appetiser, seafood & meat, vegetable, congee, rice & noodle plus dessert dishes. More than 50 items to choose from, and in less than minutes, the steaming hot dishes would be serviced gently. On this special day, they offer a special soup plus steamed fresh lobster. On ordinary weekends, the buffet price is S$68++. You must try the Char Siew Bao - they used the most highly prized pork from Japanese, super delicious! And the crispy wasabi prawn...if you are having lunch here, please make sure you skip breakfast! It is great value for money, highly recommended for special family occasion, especially for folks who appreciate great Chinese dim sum. The only imperfection is they only offered one type of Chinese Tea in the buffet package, which is the type I disliked
5
Private room with amazing food. Some deep fried food that while not my favourite was amazing in its presentation and preparation, staff were consummate professionals.

decided to have birthday dinner with family at Cherry Garden. the last we were there the weekend ala carte buffet lunch was pretty good, the ambience was good too, we chose the S$88pax menu with 15% discount. the small starter dish (like japanese kobachi) of jelly fish with sliced top shell was ok.the first course roast combination of roast duck, roast pork & char siew was very average or perhaps below average,the second course sweet & sour seafood soup was an excellent dish, just slightly sour, enough of trademark peppery taste, and a very tasty soup & pleasant to the eye as well, much better than most places, and something i would enjoy though its not my favourite soup like most lie tong were. the third course of braised abalone with deep-fried beancurd was par excellence. the abalone was tasty & had great bite, and the braising sauce was super, like in all good braising dishes – abalones, sea cucumber or goose webs. the beancurd was excellent as well. :-)the next 2 courses though were very average for this quality of restaurant. individual serving & prawns in 2 ways did not make it fine dining (the deep-fried prawn was done wasabi prawn style but with sweet & sauce) and they did not come out better than or as good as a good zi char stall. i think a wasabi prawn like the excellent ones i just had at tunglok signature would be far better. & the fish fritter with tofu hardly fit the fine palate. kok sen zi char would do better for these 2 dishes.the black sesame crabmeat fried rice was an unique, interesting dish & quite nice & tasty. the dessert, the usual 杨支甘露 served with lime sorbet, was good.overall rather surprisingly, my recent excellent dinner tunglok signature @ central was so much better than this – taste-wise the sea cucumber was superb & as good if not better than the abalone here, and all the other dishes were better!overall the food, ambience etc was quite pleasant & enjoyable, the service though was very average for this class of restaurants, made worse by the attitude of the restaurant manager. we asked for carpark redemption and was first told only valet parking could be redeemed. we don’t usually valet park however it was jam packed that evening & we did valet park (S$15). the server came back with our valet parking chip which was signed over & i asked “so is parking free?” first she said “you pay S$15″ but when i asked her to ask the manager she came back after some time & said it was free. as she obviously had difficulty speaking & understanding english as we were leaving the restaurant i asked a second time the reception lady (maybe filipino). she understood but she had no idea so i asked her to call the restaurant manager. it was a small place & i could see the manager taking an inordinately long time to come over after adjusting tableware etc for an empty table (quite unnecessarily). and when he came, he flashed an artificial smile and made an incredibly senseless comment “ö…did you dine at the restaurant?” when he was the one who helped usher us in when we arrived. he was no help at all, the staff were good in attitude poor in language & training & the manager needed to take lessons from his staff on service attitude & how to nicely cheerfully reassure customers & make warm friendly buddy gestures.hope it was one off..anyway it mattered not as customer would just vote with their feet

Just spent 3 days in Singapore at the wonderful Mandarin Oriental and had the pleasure of dining at Cherry Garden on our second night. Wow, what a fabulous meal. Every dish was prepared to perfection. Wonderful flavours and presentation. Service was second to none. Many thanks to Restaurant Manager Christopher for making our evening so memorable - cannot wait to return

My wife and I we're fortunate enough to travel to Singapore as part of our honeymoon and took the opportunity to have dinner at the Cherry Garden during our stay. Quite simply, it was a fantastic experience. From the initial welcome to our departure everything was fantastic. More specifically:Location is easy to get to and he restaurant looks great, crisp white linen with sparkling glasses and cutlery. We were very warmly greeted and then shown to our table in the restaurant, which has a traditional but modern feel. Very clean, very good ambiance. The menu was diverse but excellent and the team took the time to talk knowledgeably about the dishes, highlighting those which other diners had liked. The food was excellent, as you would expect from a restaurant of this calibre and the wine list was both diverse and thorough. Stand out though is the service which is some of the best I have come across during global travels. The team has just the right mix of friendly against professional and we're very clearly passionate. Specific call outs for Joy and Nicolas who really made us feel special
5
The restaurant looked amazing! I though they must have brought a whole real ancient house into the building. It was spacious and got the style, the professional service also made us feel like old royal China time. The food was fantastic! A well-mixed between tradition and modern. For such service and quality, for me, the price was totally acceptable
5
Thanks for TripAdvisor review, we all had a great night in Cherry Garden in June 2013 the staffs are very patient and friendly to host the guests.Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. The dim sum is delicious and freshly steamed. the mango dessert was fabulous.We have a nice chat during the dinner where environment is so cozy and relax.Overall, good service and nice food at reasonable price. I'll be back soon with some other friend
5
Had my sisters bday here. Loved the journey to the restaurant within the hotelThe interior of the restaurant is beautiful amd classy. Loved all the dishes we orderedBut what stands outis the wasabi prawns. One of the best meals in singapore. Wll come backAgain
4
It was an awkward welcome--not really any place to sit--no real explanation of what was included or if there was an additional alcohol package that could be purchased. The waiter seemed really overwhelmed by our simple party of 4. It was just awkward and confusing. Really stuffy atmosphere too. Not at all like the light happy feeling you get at most Sunday brunch seatings in Singapore. At least play some music or something. However, I will say the food was outstanding. You can get one appetizer--one of each, and one meat, one of each. One soup. Anyhow there are "rules" you need to know. Eventually a waitress came and did a much better job of clarifying what we had ordered and had not. Dimsum is unlimited, though. And they were outstanding! I'd probably go back, but would be prepared for weird little rules better in the future. PS--alcohol is outrageously expensive

After the good experience we had last here, we booked at Cherry Garden for my father's birthday (party of 6 people). After a very unpolite welcome, we had to wait for 40 minutes at least to have our food, in the meantime we were seeing other people, arrived after us, being already served! The air-conditioning was absolutely freezing and disturbing so we asked if it were possible to lower it down a little bit, they answered it was centralized and that they would have provided us with some shawls, after 15 minutes we asked for shawls and they said that they were out of shawls! After a while we saw them providing shawls to the the nearest table! Then food arrived, but in the wrong order! But it was so late and we were so hungry that we ate anyway.The situation was so paradoxical that we tried not to be angry and not to ruin by father's birthday dinner. Food was quite good - but not as one would expect from a Mandarin Oriental standard - anyway we were so upset by the bad manners of the staff that we couldn't enjoy the dinner. To the Food & Beverage Management of Mandarin Oriental: this is not acceptable from an hotel like yours, we experienced a clear lack of respect and we felt joked by the staff which was totally unsuitable for such a reknowned restaurant
5
I ate in the Cherry Garden several times during my stay at the Mandarin Oriental in August 2013. The food was outstanding and even at the high price point (up to GBP 50 per person for dinner without alcohol) represented good value for money.There is a great selection of tasty Cantonese delights on the menu and the service also includes an amuse bouche de jour and lime sorbet to refresh the palate after your main course. Staff are extremely friendly and remembered my name after the first visit.The space is attractively decorated and in keeping with the other areas of the hotel. Natural materials and dark woodwork complement attractive floral displays and Chinese bric-a-brac. There is an attractive zen garden outside for smokers and even though I do not smoke myself it was quite a pleasant space to stretch the legs briefly after dinner.Particularly recommended are the crispy duck and pork ribs
5
Everything was delicious and servise was great!
Apetisers was melting in mouth and Duck was very tasty!
Thanks to Tripadvisor tips!

The dim sum buffet is fantastic!!! Nice variety with a touch of fusion. Only gripe i have is that it can be pricey. If you find it so, I would highly recommend Imperial Treasure as a cheaper, almost as good, alternative.
4
A very nice dining experience. The food was good and the staff were very friendly and attentative. The surroundings were beautiful. The steamed chocolate buns were delicious and so were the other puddings. Very nice meal but perhaps a little overpriced.
5
Once again the Mandarin Oriental shines. We had such a lovely meal in this restaurant and as before overwhelmed by such attentive staff. This restaurant is well worth a visit.
3
I had mixed feelings about this resaturant. The restaurant is very beautiful. There are a lot of Chinese paintings, calligraphies and art decorations. It is a pleasure just to walk around and appreciate the settings. However, the food quality was not very consistent. I ordered a daily soup and two other small dishes. The daily soup was the Chinese version of the minestrone - tomato, carrots and doubled boiled chicken. One would hardly expect to have such a daily soup in a traditional Cantonese restaurant. The steamed cod fish in soya sauce was light and delicious. The soya sauce was well balanced and went very well with my steam rice. The fried asparagus was crunchy but carried a bit too much garlic. The service was also less than satisfactory. I went in the restaurant at about 9:40 pm and there was only one table of guests. There were three staff and only one was experienced. I had to trace for the menu, the tea and the food. I would expect more speedy service especially when it was closed to the closure time of 10:30 pm
4
Came here for a late dinner and had a full lobster dinner which was pretty delicious. Well cooked with good flavors. I'm overall happy with the meal. It wasn't amazing, but it was good. Would I go back again? Probably not... primarily because of the cost of the meal
5
While many of the items are not traditional, almost every item tasted wonderful. The two-hour sitting was well worthwhile, as we had a free flow of dim sum from an alacarte menu, and that included soups, mains and desserts. The vegetable dumpling and beef dumplings were my favourites. The ambience is also nice. A great way to splurge on an occasional Sunday. Note: only on weekends and set sittings at 11 or 1
5
A great Chinese restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental, food is great and elegantly served. Staff very friendly and the design of the restaurant makes it possible to have private conversations even when the place is full.Go for the set menus, it makes it possible to taste a lot of great dishes.Would definitely eat here again when I get the chance to visit Singapore again
4
This is a calm haven, housed in the Mandarin Oriental hotel, with exceptional service and very good food. The menu has a wide variety of Cantonese food and everything we ordered was both delicious and well-presented. There is a choice of size for many dishes, and we ordered the small size as we wanted to try a number of different dishes; this was a good move as the portion sizes were generous. The seafood dishes were particularly good and it was nice to find an Alsace riesling on the wine list to accompany the food
5
The attention that we received from the staff, combined with the quality of the food throughout made for a relaxing and enjoyable evening.Unfortunately our enjoyment was briefly interrupted by the arrival of two businessmen, one of whom, when he wasn't swearing down his mobile phone at a business colleague, made a point of berating the staff for the lack of burgers and steaks on the menu of the Cantonese restaurants menu! The polite and courteous way that the staff dealt with this customer was yet again to their credit, in fact the staff were more concerned with the way his moronic actions would be ruining our evening than we were.I would highly recommend that you choose the Cherry Garden and hopefully the less open-minded will have spotted the hotels steak restaurant to allow you to enjoy the experience at its bes
4
Cherry Garden is a good chinese restaurant located again in Mandarin Oriental. The food quality is fantastic, especially their mango lemon sorbet as a dessert.
They are known for their dimsums, and boy, aren't they to die for.
Service is top notch as well.
4
Here the food is authentic and tasty, service so warm and friendly,perfect atmosphere!! Just a bit expensive but we'll go again!!!
2
I'm italian, I used to spend to go out to eat well. but this is the most expansive restaurant I've ever been in my life. They are creazy!!! and the food is not so good.
5
Had a birthday dinner with my family on 23 Mar 2013, it was a crowded evening when i arrived. Straight away i was warmly greeted and shown to my seat.The food was delicious especially the peking duck and the fish was fresh. Despite another big group, service was prompt and efficient. We finished the night with a refreshing dessert, cheeries infused crushed ice with jelly and a scoop of lychee sorbet.I will definately recommend this place to my friends. Well done guys
5
Excellent food and service in a very pretty setting. I loved the seafood hot and sour soup as well as the BBQ sampler plate. Much better that some of the other Chinese food we had on this trip. NOTE...check your bill. My entree was $32 on the menu but I was charged $38. The waitress apologized and corrected it, but said $38 is the new price but they haven't changed the menu price yet. I would recommend it highly

Dim Sum at the Cherry Garden has become a frequent treasure for me since I discovered it last year. My favourite time to visit is during the weekend dim sum brunch. There are 2 sittings, at 12 and then at 1.30, unless you are going for the champagne brunch then you may stay the whole time. I recommend to book a couple of days ahead if you are not staying in the hotel. The first time we visited they told us it was fully booked, but called us back and said there was a space, phew! The concept is table service in the authentically decorated restaurant. The staff are the typical Mandarin Hotel hosts, exquisite politeness, and effortlessly helpful. There are so many items on the menu you might not know what to order, they will guide you through and order bit by bit. How many dishes you can order of what part of the menu was a little confusing at first but the waiter made sure were full of delicacies by the time we left. Highlights were the soups; I was told the mushroom one had a medicinal taste, but it was very pleasant and warming. The wasabi prawns were my favourite from the main menu portion. From the dim sum part the crystal jade dumplings are full of flavour. Donâ€™t miss out on the chocolate custard balls on the dim sum menu. Freshly squeezed with fresh chocolate cream, these are worth going back for alone
4
Went there several times. I would say it is better to go there with many people so that you can try many dim sum. But every time we manage to order well, it was excellent. Every time we went there with a little crowd of small eaters we were disappointed as we could not try much. (Unless you dare wasting the ordered dim sum if you find then not tasty...). So go there with many people and make sure you are starving.
4
I felt that everything was prepared in a very high standard including their service. The interior design is fantastic - elegant, class and relaxing.Timing of service, from one dish to another, was also very well calculated and so you could enjoy each food in the most desirable condition.It would be your choice how you would like to dine in Singapore: value for money in local restaurants, mid-range, or high-end... This is the great thing about Singapore that you have a plenty of options to enjoy various kind of tasty food! I would be happy to go back to Cherry Garden for another occasion
4
The restaurant is located in the Mandarin Oriental at Marina Bay, in a very nice setting of oriental style. Service is esquisite and the dining room very elegant and quiet (but with the typical annoying background music...)Food is of good level, with good execution and presentation. Only few details were not up to the expectations (a squid a bit chewy, a fried rice without personality). I focused on seafood and both the soup and the crab were very good, as was the dessert. Overall a solid choice if you are not looking for originality and inventive style.Pricy, as expected, but not out of proportions
4
We had dinner at the Cherry Garden to celebrate my husband's birthday and we had a very good experience at the restaurant, our first time there. The wait staff was polite and friendly, helped with suggestions (that went down well) and made sure we were not over-ordering. The food went beyond being good, there were flavours present that combined to make delightful food and tempt the palate
5
A local took us here. The menu was interesting and the taste sensational! Also worth having a wander around the public spaces of the hotel - great design and artwork
3
Food was good but we had a poor table and the service was so very fast we were in and out in less than an hour. Dare I say I felt like I was in a disney restaurant! Would not return.
4
Fine Chinese food, in a great looking (but dark) restaurant.
Nothing overly impressive, nor suprising, though.
Unlikely I'd go again.

So let's start by qualifying this review. I am a fan of cherry garden and have been eating here for over 10 years. The restaurant is and remains a jewel in Singapore and if you come here you would be extremely unlucky to have a bad experience.The food is phenomenal - genuinely. Tastes are complex but not overly so. In this last meal I ate the best platter. The duck, char sui and roasted pork belly were perfect. Just enough crispness and ccomplemented well with the condiments. The sweet and sour prawns were the tastiest I have had. One thing that is impossible to fault in this restaurant is the chef. Great job.The other thing that is impossible to fault is the service. Our servers on this visit were Ben and Matthew. Consummate professionals who took time to chat but never at the expense of theory other guests and genuinely make you feel welcome. Attention to detail - this is the only restaurant in Singapore where the servers recognised I am left handed and more the chopsticks before I even notice. These guys are good! Their advice on what to eat, rice v noodles and an appropriate kicking to me to stop always eating the same dishes and try something new. So - the problem. 50% increase in price (prawns were 8 Sgd per 100g and are now 12). The sweet and sour dish was incredible but at 30 Sgd for 6 prawns it is a rip off. Breaks my heart to see this as I love this restaurant but the price is now clearly aimed at ripping off the in house business guest. As I said eaten here for 10 years and this time the price increase and portion size reduction were notable. Great for those on a diet.
5
Ate dinner here with family and friends and was quite impressed by the exotic and diverse menu. With my kids and some less adventurous eaters with us we had to choose a bit more conservatively, which was still possible. Everything was very tasty. Most of the dishes came very quickly
5
I had lunch at the Cherry garden on 02 January. The menu is extensive, exceptional service, staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.Best Chinese dinning experience yet. Elegant dinning room, the Food is very fresh and aromatic.The menu gives you the option to chose the size of the dishes(i.e. S, M, L) which is very convenient as you can adjust your order according to party's size. Staff also assisted us by serving each dish and bring it to the table in portions.We had no complaints about this restaurant, we left satisfied with our food and looking forward to our return
2
We went for lunch while at the MO for 7 days.We selected this property as it had a high trip advisor rating and we were staying onsite.Our expectation was a high quality experience, including food and service.We were greatly disappointed.Firstly, our server seemed committed to steer of to "western" style dishes (we are American and Canadian).She went as far to aggressively persuade us against a "wok fired" noodle dish, as the "guests think it is too salty" -- were literally had to promise to her we would not sent it back if we did not like it, and even then she did not seem to want to serve it to us.Ironically, that was our favorite dish and the only one that did not seem "designed for westerners".All of the other dishes we got, many on our servers recommendation, were bland and without inspiration.Big disappoint overall, as this is a pricey place to eat, with lunch costing about $300 Sing Dollars, with service fee, tax and drinks

I looked forward to having a delectable meal at Cherry Garden. As a restaurant of MOHG, it certainly fell overtly short on expectations. Perhaps I was just expecting too much, but that certainly can't be helped, for I list MO and all its restaurants within the league of them upper crust hotels. Unlike several other luxury hotels I've been to this one certainly lacks the grace and poise of how a 5-star hotel restaurant should be. Service was almost non-existent, napkins weren't laid out for the diner, only ONE menu was given per table and prices weren't relative to the service I've been experiencing during that seating thus far. As I was there for my dim sum fix, I ordered a 'dim sum trilogy', which is apparently a selection of dim sum dumplings that showcases the culinary excellence their chef is so famed for (which tragically isn't the case), har gao (which tasted like something out of those local Singaporean tea houses), siew mei with abalone (again, so lacklustre that even the snazzy abalone topping can't save its poor taste), deep fried yam puffs (which were in dark brown colour rather than a golden hue, which goes to show that the frying oil isn't as clean as it should be and roast pork belly (which was not only just fat and no flesh, but it reeked very strongly of non-marinated, unseasoned pork! What made this experience even more terrible was that the dim sum baskets were all crudely presented a la Singaporean tea house style.To top it all off, service was slow, poorly organised and managed! For a luxury hotel restaurant to tout itself as a Cantonese restaurant certainly doesn't do them Cantonese 'Si Fu (master chef)' justice at all!My first visit and will most certainly be my last - it's better to spend your keep at a Cantonese restaurant (if you are in the mood for one like me) that's more deserving of your time, money and above all effort. Not sure if I could write this tip here but heck, Imperial Treasure Group NEVER fails me, branch and service level regardless
3
The sice of the dishes were strange - 1 person was hungry after dinner, as the sice of the dish was so small and the other person had to much. We had the meals we ordered already at a other restaurant, so we were able to compare. Even we are Europeans, we know how ablone should taste.
5
great for lunch with family or friends. superb food, modern ambience (though this is not the strength of this restaurant) and highly attentive staffing. the lunch set menu is quite long and there are great dishes to chose from. we particularly like fried shrimps in ginger (delicious), dumplings stuffed with chocolate, drunken chicken dumplings and braised beef in pepper sauce. will come again
5
The food was superb. We had one of the set menu's and everything was very tasty. The service was also very good. Genuinely, a very good restaurant.
4
My wife and I had lunch here and loved the food, we had a selection of dumplings, peking duck and a main dish which were all very good. The service was also very good, which makes a change for Singapore in general.
5
This has to be the best lunch we ever had. Service and food were 10/10. Could not fault anything except they close at 230pm for lunch and we were still going strong!!!! Can definitely recommend and understand why it is one of Singapores top restaurants
4
We love peking duck this is the best place to go for Duck. We like very much. Crispy skin and good meat! Vey good Chinese food!
5
Ate here with a business colleague. We shared half a Peking duck which was excellent. The staff were very helpful in advising on what to have. Overall a very pleasant meal. Be warned that wine is very expensive; apart from that the meal cost was very reasonable for Singapore
4
I personally prefer the food at another Chinese restaurant, Wah Ting, if I have to have a sit down Chinese dinner. The food is a sight better at Wah Ting, but not enough that when I have to entertain, and the ambience is important, Cherry Garden becomes the obvious choice.We had the Si 思 dinner menu. I made a deliberate substitution in the soup because I am partial to the special dumpling soup 半汤胶. If you're there at lunch, you can try this great dish for yourself. It is a thinly wrapped mega wanton or dumpling that has as far as I can tell, shark fin and conpoy. 2 of many other ingredients. The guava dessert should also be given special mention as should the granita of cherry infused with Chinese wine 女儿红. Both delectable and refreshing.The service was excellent, prompt and attentive. The winelist recommendations were spot on for the selected menu
3
Went here to actually have a birthday meal whilst staying at Mandarin Oriental.What a disappointment!!! Having read such excellent reviews, hubby decided it would be special to eat here rather than try and find another location, after all it was on site and apparently had a wonderful reputation!!!1 - we asked for our first choice of starter - nothing unusual in our choice it was simply chicken & sweetcorn soup - they had run out !!!2 - the recommended alternative when it came was anything but like the menu description!! We both like mushrooms, but this was extreme.3 - we ordered a bottle of white Italian wine, at £50 for a Pinot Grigio, even by a 5 star hotel standard, for the standard of wine this was way excessive.In summary, we paid way over £100 for what in our opinion was a meal worth at best £30 in the UK. We travel and stay in 5 star hotels frequently (in fact still in one, but in KL at moment), and this fell way below what should be expected for this level of hotel restaurant

Wonderful, delicious, cantonese food and restaurant manager that was so helpful, allowing us to enjoy a meal in our suite, given we had two small children that would have found the fine dining experience a challenge!Well done to Cherry Garden chefs, wait staff and manager

But if you were hoping for Chinese food, forget it. The Schezhuan dish tasted like Thai sweet chilli sauce, while one of the dipping sauces seemed to be based on cream cheese. I asked the waitress what was in it, and her reply was that it was a "secret": which means, I guess, that either she did not know, or was embarrassed -- and neither reason is a good one. Of another dish I was warned I might find it "too Chinese" -- how very odd, in a Chinese restaurant! While my companion, who does not speak English, discovered that only one of the staff on the floor that night was able to explain the menu to her in Chinese. A "true Chinese restaurant"? Not even remotely

Cherry Garden is laid out in a oriental outdoor courtyard concept. There are many nooks and crannies in the restaurant, allowing for some degree of privacy. Went to this restaurant after reading on tripAdvisorWe had a delicious meal here in beautifully appointed surroundings. Decor was simple yet classy. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious....

A true Chinese restaurant in the middle of a nice hotel. I had Peking duck and appetizers as recommended by the restaurant. Everything was very stylish and nice and quiet. Closes pretty early but that is the only minus.
5
This was fantastic, the food, the service and the hotel. It was very expensive especially the wine but worth it for a special occasion.
5
We have not eaten at every restaurant in Singapore but we have not had a better Chinese meal than here. This was our fourth visit over three years. Service is immaculate, the food is innovative, tasty and beautifully presented. The room itself lends a great backdrop to the meal

Went with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday and a work success. We loved it! We couldn't figure out where to go for brunch but were glad we finally agreed on the Cherry Garden. We went for the 118$ brunch option with unlimited dim sum, an appetizer, a main, a veg and a rice or noodle, plus unlimited Ruinart champagne. The service was great. We walked in feeling a bit out of place as we aren't very formal but the wait staff was very welcoming. I can be a bit picky so explained shamefully that I only eat certain things. The waitress was lovely about it and shared the message with the other staff who then even pointed out when we by mistake ordered something containing something I don't eat. We were bowled over by the gyoza which were crispy and soft at the same time (filled with chicken mushroom aubergine and tofu), and also by the crystal dumplings with mushrooms and courgettes, and the drunken chicken dumplings. Stir fried young pak choi also great and I adored the chocolate filled custard dumplings ! Let's not forget the yummy crispy aubergine with chicken floss! Lovely meal which went wonderfully well with quite a lot of champagne :) we will be back

We went for the champagne brunch to celebrate a couple of things. Initially the place feels a little formal but the staff are lovely and friendly and soon make you feel at home. Service that is both good and relaxed. The food is great, particularly the beef and ginger Dim sum, the custard chocolate buns, the soya chicken, the drunken chicken dim sum actually it was all fantastic. Add to that free flow Ruinart champagne and it becomes tricky to imagine a better brunc

We were staying at The Mandarin and so were blessed to have so many fantastic restaurants in out hotel.We had a lovely meal in Cherry Garden. It was rather over priced but we came to realise that of everywhere in Singapore ( against GBP). The presentation and taste was as to be expected.The bonus for us was our lovely server, Joy. She made suitable recommendations for both main and desserts and spent time chatting away with us, even when the rest of the restaurant was void of customers and it was clearly home time for the staff.She made it a memorable visit

We went to Cherry Garden for dinner this week and wished we hadn't. The lights were blazingly bright and the air conditioning was freezing cold. When I asked the lady who seated us if she could find us a table with dimmer lighting and not so cold it was as if I had insulted her family ! With a pout she marched off to another table with us trailing in her wake.Our mains came out together but no side dishes. We waited for the sides and by the time they came (thanks to the aircon) the mains were cold. We sent it all back and after another 20 minutes the mains came out with no sides. And on it went. While this went on we enjoyed a nice bottle of red.Eventually we ate, we finished, we paid the bill (over $300 for 2) and vowed never to return

First time to visit the restaurant but have heard lots of good reviews from others before. However, the food was average and I can get similar quality items at less cost at other locations. My friend and I did not order their set seafood menus which were quite pricey but I saw most of the tables getting that; do maybe those were worth the dollars. Overall I find it too dark for a Chinese restaurant, but I take it that westerners are use to this. And the chinese songs being played in the restaurant was from the 70s and early 80s

The dim sum brunch here is just divine! The variety of fare was one of the best I've seen for a dim sum buffet and every item was so contemporary and meticulously put together. From juicy drunken chicken or ginger beef dumplings, to crispy wasabi prawns, melt-in-the-mouth Sichuan pork ribs, and the asparagus with XO sauce, every dish was Delicious with a capital 'D'! Desserts too were sumptuous - mango and pomelo sago, and avocado cream with walnut ice cream should definitely be sampled. The desserts are stunningly presented on a bowl of dry ice providing a dramatic finale to a delicious experience.The reasons I have given Cherry Garden four stars instead of five is because I felt the menu should have at least one or two more vegetarian items, for example - none of the soups were vegetarian and there was only one vegetarian dumpling dish out of several on the menu. The waiter was very accommodating however, and asked the chef to leave out the pork in the egg fried rice for our vegetarian guest. Second, I had made a reservation more than one month in advance but we were seated in a relatively darker, isolated corner of the restaurant, in the room to the right of the entrance. Unfortunately, this table was placed under air vents blasting out icy cold air as is the norm in Singapore. I asked if we could be moved and apparently all the tables had been reserved in advance (well, so had mine!!), but the main section of the restaurant was not really full for the second sitting and there was hardly anyone there when we arrived. Again, a staff member was accommodating enough to provide a shawl to ward off the cold but I would be more specific about my table booking next time. Third, while the staff were very friendly, I did not feel service was as attentive as it should be. For example, I had to ask for a dish for soy sauce, had to request condiments, and had to ask for table water twice and even then a glass of water was only brought for one person out of our party of three. This was a little annoying as we felt we had to keep trying to grab someone's attention and being in the corner, this was sometimes a challenge.Been for dim sum brunch elsewhere and the attentiveness of service at the Fullarton Hotel's Jade restaurant is definitely miles ahead, although the variety of dishes at Cherry Garden is superior, of course matched by the buffet's higher price. All in all, a great dining experience in beautiful surroundings - one that will have me going back for more

My husband and I staying at the hotel had been tying ourselves in knots trying to work out where to go for anniversary dinner. When all along it had been under our noses. The cherry garden is a wonderful restaurant with attentive, yet discreet staff ( thankyou Joy) But the star of the evening was the food. We had set menu + 1/2 duck. A bit piggy yes, but glad we did it. Everything was exquisite! Including the wine and especially the Peking duck. A bit pricey, but a meal we will never forget
5
Great for quiet lunch meeting or meeting with a friend; excellent service and excellent and deliciously fresh dim sum.
5
One of the physically most beautiful restaurants I've seen, with exquisite food to match. In a group, try one of the set meals, which provide several wonderful courses at a surprisingly reasonable price. Perfect portion sizes allow you to try a large number of items.

there is very good environment to eat in and the food are simply excellent

We were in Singapore to celebrate our daughter's birthday. We wanted to go somewhere special, so after reading all the rave reviews, we decided to have dinner at Cherry Garden. Everything turned out so beautifully perfect: the place was quietly elegant, the food delicious & the service impeccable. We feasted on trilogy of mushrooms; superior broth with shrimps, scallops & crabmeat; Peking duck which was crispy & intensely flavorful and was so artistically presented in a box; crispy noodles with seafood; but the best was the crispy wasabi-aioli prawns with fish roe. They were the most delicious prawns I have ever tasted. Batter was light & crisp & the prawns had just enough spicy flavor to enliven the dish. For dessert, we really enjoyed the cream of avocado with walnut ice cream which was served over bubbling dry ice, and the deep fried chinese pancake stuffed with red bean paste was to die for. We couldn't get enough! Sean & Evelyn were the most efficient & well trained servers we've encountered in all of Singapore. They were polite, unobtrusive & very well versed with the menu. When they found out it was our daughter's birthday, they promptly produced a small birthday cake with a candle for her to blow. It was truly a memorable & fantastic experience! Cherry Garden has our vote for the #1 restaurant in Singapore & we will make it a point to keep coming back every time we're in town

Normally the fact that something is all you can eat tends to mean that the quality is not so great- however this was completely the opposite. The dim sum was amazing. A good mix of traditional choices and a few unique dishes- like the crispy wasabi-aioli prawns with fresh mango- were really good. The pork they use in their dishes is really good quality and tastes great.To top it off, desserts were great and if you order the mango pudding, you're up for a really cool experience. I would definitely go back again
5
Once again I visited my friends in Singapore and they surprised me to go for Brunch to Mandarin Oriental- one of my favourites anyway- but this time they had chosen the Chinese restaurant of the hotel- Cherry Garden.As expected the service was again top notch with such well trained and friendly staff.We had booked the champagne brunch including the Ruinart Champagne, which is my favourite and I was really happy when I saw that they serve that special champagne, which is very rare to get and not always Veuve Cliquot or Moet like in most of the other places. We have been to St Regis and Capella before but they don't even come close of what you experience here... For $118,- great value for money!!!When the dishes arrived it couldn't get any better. This was really the best Dim Sum I ever had and I have been to many so called top chinese restaurants in Singapore but the one at Cherry Garden topped all my experiences- so I had to order again and again:-)Overall it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back next time I am here:-)Thank you for that Cherry Garden and team!!

Martha the manager is excellent and the staff is equally good. They make everyone feel like a king! The service is the best I have seen in a long time. The food is equally good. Very clean and fresh, not a lot of oil. The seafood is really fresh. Duck, barbecue pork is excellent. The veggies extremely fresh and cooked to perfection. The Dim Sum is also excellent. Try the wasabi shrimp! We really enjoyed

Visited 'cherry garden' with friends and family. The first thing you notice at the restaurant is the ambience and the large tables filled with customers in family groups or with friends. The ambience is awesome with an outdoor effect created by palms and other greenery all around the dining area. The place has a welcoming feel for families and even for romantic dinners.While ordering, I was impressed that they manged to let us taste an SG $ 100 Riesling wine even before they opened our order. Wasabi aioli prawns as starters were awesome. Also the steamed cod fish in soya sauce was out of this world. The nice white cube of cod in a bowl with soya sauce at the bottom actually looked like an sculpted piece of art. We rounded off the meal in nice style with sorbet in mango pulp served on fuming dry ice. All in all a little pricey at SG$100 per person but very satisfying meal
5
We had lunch here and we thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the experience. The table attendants were exceptional, explaining all the dishes and helping us with suggestions to enhance our dining experience. Importantly, as my dining partner has particular dietary requirements the attendant was able to assist in making a selection from the menu and even double checked with the chef. The meal was superb in every aspect. The fried rice was delectable. The decor and ambience were all heavenly. I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant.

I have to admit that Cherry Garden is not on the top of my list if I want to eat Chinese food in Singapore. However, on my first visit there I was pleasantly surprised, how wonderful it is. The ambience of the restaurant is a throw back - like an old classic Shanghainese parlour, but done very tastefully. Upon entering, you are guided to your table with a smile. Service here is very very good, everyone is smiling, talking softly, and attentive. Unfortunately for all of Singapore's efficiencies this is not a normal event you would find on this island. My only gripe is some of the waitresses' English is a bit difficult to understand because of the heavy accent. Enough about the service now the food.I have to say the menu is extensive, no doubt a good thing, but a bit confusing for hungry "don't know what to eat " people like my friend and me. However, the manager was there to help guide us along and give recommendations. I liked that he saw that there was only two of us and did not encourage us to over order. We concluded on fried battered prawns with wasabi aioli, Peking duck, fried garlic vegetables and steamed (hongkong style) sliced cod fish. The battered prawns arrived plump, lightly battered with a nice mayo dip. The portions were very good and most importantly it was crunchy but firm and the mayo sauce was not cloyingly sweet and heavy like you would find in alot of places. The peking duck was really really good. I have to admit Peking duck is my passion and this was one of the best Peking duck I've ever had. The skin was very crispy, but not oily. The roll was thick but had a nice texture and not too soggy. It arrived nicely warmed.The sauce was not a coagulant mess but lightly sweet.Veggies, check very good. The steam sliced-cod fish, was very fresh and was served in nice light soy sauce, not too salty. I enjoyed it tremendously.I liked that there are a large selection of wine by the glass for both red and white. The service staff are knowledgeable about the wine they offer and were on hand to advise if you are not sure what will go well with the food you ordered.For dessert, we ordered cream of avocado with walnut ice cream. The presentation was spectacular for this, as it arrived in a bowl of dry ice. Needless to say, it was reallly really yummy and the bowl was wiped clean. We wanted an encore, but was informed the kitchen was closed. It was nice of the staff to go and double check to make sure that the kitchen was truely closed and even nicer when he offered to procure desserts from other kitchens in the hotel for us.It was a truly enjoyable dinner, where service is very good and the food quality is excellent. I think this might end up being one of my new favourite chinese restaurant in town.http://www.mandarinoriental.com/singapore/dining/cherry_garden

We been in this place two time in one week. Great food and also the service. We tried main chinese food and my wife told me was great the duck with the special sauce.
I think they need to change the music so bad.......

Lunch with customers. Great service & quality. They were pleased. I started with a Scallop dish that was truly memorable. Very clan spot with attentive service.

Great staff! Really love the environment and decorations!

We had a early dinner as a last meal of our vacation and it was just superb! The best chinameal we have ever had, everything taste so good. Don't miss this place if you're in Singapore.

I dined here with friends several years ago. While the food was generally of good quality, there was nothing outstanding about it.Service was good, the waiting staff were attentive and dishes were changed after each course.Other than this, it was not a very memorable dining experience
5
The quality of the Cantonese cooking is first class and certainly on a par with Hong Kong. We particularly enjoyed fish with tofu in black bean sauce served hot pot style but both a chicken and a prawn dish could not be faulted. The dining area is attractively presented in oriental style. Located in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel it is of course expensive but I think it represents reasonable value for the overall experience. Service generally is good although our waitress had an annoying tendency to assume that since we were Westerners we might prefer something different to our order or was this too spicy etc. Surely, we are not all on our first trip to Asia? The wine list is pricey
5
Refined dim-sum in elegant surroundings with faultless service. The buffet set (extensive Chinese-English menu that one chooses from) is good value; top up a little for champagne and unlimited orders of premium dishes (which otherwise one can order one each of) - if you are lost, just be adventurous and order one of everything (it's a LOT of food).Hong Kong may have better Chinese food overall, but Singapore is the true Asian foodie wonderland with excellent representations of nearly every Asian culinary tradition. Both cities boast top-notch (and usually, though not exclusively, expensive) Western restaurants, but Singapore's humble street food options are in a class of their own. Back to the point - Cherry Garden, as a high-end (not the most expensive, but enough to make it non-everyday) Chinese restaurant, is up there with the best.
5
We came for our anniversary. The server made recommendations which were perfect. We wanted a little more spice and she asked us to give her a minute. She returned with a soy sauce pepper combination that was exactly what we wanted. Super service and terrific food
4
Food was really good - the duck dishes are the real highlight, in my view - and staff was very attentive. Rather pricey but that is expected given its location in a 5* hotel. Atmosphere was very quiet and was quite a surprise given the buzz in nearby places
5
Just returned after evening dining to farewell holidays.Couldn't decide on a-la-carte vs. various banquet formats so decided to try 7-course set to sample a bit of everything.Food presentation - outstanding Flavoura, freshness and consistency to delight any discerning palate.Cantonese dining the equal of any 1-star Michelin resturant I have dined at.Chef was happy to substitute a dish that I cannot eat without fuss and the waiting staff were very helpful and unobtrusive.Only mild criticism was with the price of wine. Happy to drink more cold San Pelligreno as a palate cleanser between courses anyway!!!This was a memorable meal to finish up our family vacation and was more than an equal of many fine meals in Italy and Spain.Highly recommended +++++

Good food and free flow Ruinart Champagne! Nothing outstanding though
5
We had a delicious meal here in beautifully appointed surroundings. Decor was simple yet classy. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious.....the mango dessert was 'the icing on the cake' so to speak. Staff were courteous, prompt and discrete. An altogether memorable experience that didn't break the bank
4
For 48++ you'll get a soup, starter, main, dessert and endless flow of dim sums. At 118++ they'll add unlimited champagne. Great for a long, lazy weekend brunch/ lunch with friends.The food was very good. The service was average considering its located in the mandarin oriental. The ambiance is ok...less than what the dramatic entrance would suggest
5
We ate here on Christmas eve having flown into Singapore earlier in the day from the UK, I was worried that we may not appreciate meal as we were all bit tired. The restaurant was lovely and the food was really excellent. We were given very helpful advice from the waiter which was spot on. Food came quickly, good atmosphere without being ridiculously noisy or loud. I never begrudge paying a bit more for meals so long as food is good and this one was very good. Highly recommended
4
We ate here on Christmas night. The 6 course set menu dinner was first class and the service was excellent bordering on being over attentive. The wine list is long but even given the location the mark up on what were some ordinary wines was ridiculously high. In summary go for a great gastronomic experience but wash it down with water rather than alcohol
4
I went with two friends who were in Singapore for the day. We went for the Sunday Dim sum buffet with champers. The dim sum is delicious and freshly steamed eachround. The bubbles are smooth and go well with the dumplings. Overall the place is good and the service too. Only drawback is that the ambience is more formal rather then funky/cool but thats expected of a hotel resturant. I would go back again but there are so many places to try that I am not sure if it will happen. I would reccommend it if you are entertaining and need a chilled out place
4
Service: Top notch from reservations to wait staff. Polite knowledgable and attentive. They even introduced each dish as they comeAmbience: Elegant cosy and private. Great for quality couple and family time or biz entertaining. Tables god distance apart with Chinese classics playing in backgroundFood: Beautifully presented, with some fusion twists like cheese with gyoza. My fav dim sum item here is beef ginger dumplings hard to find elsewhere. To me, the dishes were more memorable than dim sum. Especially desserts (and I am not sweets person)Overall: Pricey from $48 per pax but still worthwhile for special treatsI can't wait to return tomorrow and hope to be delighted once again
2
While the food was good it was not sufficiently better than you would find in many restaurants, and considering the price difference very much trading on the hotel. If this was a stand alone then would not expect to see it in top 20 for sure. Service was average, had to call staff over for more wine (they take bottle away to chill) and the food did not come out together so were left with our mains but no rice, no noodles, no veg for about 10 mins which spoilt it a little more. The ambiance is 5/10 way too light for evening dining, and while not restaurants fault our anniversary dinner was topped by a member of the next table who got drunk, fell a sleep on the table, before vomiting all over himself.... About $300 for two people, few embaressed appoligies from staff, but not much else means I will not be rushing bac
4
We went of the strengths of the trip advisor reviews, and I was a little disappointed. It is good, very good, but I think there are better places at more reasonable prices. Check out Bistro Soori for example.All in all good, but will not be going back, too many other places to try
5
While in Singapore, take the opportunity to have Saturday brunch here. There is two sittings for brunch, at 11am and at 1pm, and booking a table beforehand is absolutely required.The fare is contemporary Chinese, with a lovely selection of dim sum as the forte of the menu. The onion, ginger and beef steamed dumplings were particularly good, as was the avocado and walnut ice cream.Service is attentive and pleasant, with forks being provided for those who requested them. There were families with small children in the restaurant.This is one of the best restaurants in Singapore and it is not cheap. As an occasional treat, or for a business lunch it's just perfect; the food and ambience are worth it
5
I just love the food - their wasabi prawns are the best - very friendly service - just pleasant and tasteful!
5
Good service, delicious food in a comfortable environment.
5
Food and service was very good and they were able to cater for someone that needed to eat gluten free.

Went twice during my stay in Singapore
Best Dim Sum I ever had (Sunday brunch)
Dinner was amazing Beef in Black Pepper , Peking Duck , wasabi prawns....
Suberb !

This restaurant is love at first sight, from the moment you walk in, that special feel due to the design elements and surroundings will make you wonder whether you walk into the palace. In term of the qualities of the dishes and their dim sums, they are just as impressive as their surroundings. Their service quality is among the highest we have ever experience
5
I am very picky when it comes to food when it comes to Cherry Garden, I am never left feeling disappointed with their food. It is always of the highest quality and always exquisite in taste as well as presentation. For what you get, the place is very reasonably priced too

Boy, to read the ratings and reviews and to consider that this is highly ranked in a town where even night hawker stands serve amazing food, I was really disappointed with the meal. We were there early. That may have lead to the feeling of solitude and stuffiness and pretension. But is was strange how all us Caucasians were seated on one side at elevation (my wife called it Ang Mo Row) and apart. That was awkward. Locals here, gweilos there. The abalone was astonishly bad, and astonishingly expensive. The other dishes were good but hey, there is a food court across the street that can match for quality at 1/10th the price, and the dim sum upstairs in the Club level were better. We may have hit them on an off night and we may have ordered the exact wrong things on the menu and it might have been fun to come with many more people to try many more things on the telephone book sized menu but taste/dollar ratio was way too low that night. There are three reasons to go to this restaurant: 1)You are on someone else's expense account, 2) You are trying to impress a large group of clients, and â€¦ actually I can't think of a third reason
5
I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights a week ago. The room is ok, elegant, clean and nice just like other 5-star hotels in Singapore. The thing that impressed me most is the Cherry Garden restaurant featured Cantonese food. Delicious dishes, fast service and good price are what I can say about the place. The signature double-boiled shark cartilage soup is what I love most, I had to ordered 2 portions each meal everyday, lol. Thanks for the pleasant hospitality and such an authentic atmosphere of this hotel
5
We try to go there every other weekend for the Dim Sum brunch, they are by far the freshest and most succulent Dim Sum I ever tasted! the dinner menu during the week is also mouthwatering! The staff is always very kind and attentive to every detail (such as food allergies etc) My top picks are:1- Wasabi aioli prawns2- Eggplant with chicken floss3- Crispy duck4- Cream of mango dessertA must when in singapore
2
.. which partly made up for the disappointing experience. But not fully. The food was delicious, no question. I had a set menu (which as all other set menus were for at least 2 persons, but upon request they were able to make it for one person) and the beef course were really out of this world. Not all dishes were that good, but an overall impression of the food is that it was very good. So was the location and scenary. And the prices.The service was however.. not heartfelt, just polite, as if they had an exact instruction on how to act, what to say.. On a hotel that do offer free wifi to their staying guests, I find it really strange and actually directly not to give a dinner guest the password upon request. The "no" was not even explained or appologized for; it was like I requested something extreme. Service is supposed to make your guests feel well. When they do not offer a solo guest, having reserved a table in advance, anything to read and you get denied a simple request for wifi access (which would cost them nothing), that tells me the waiters are just trained to do what they do; to ask me to mind my steps for every single step and to call me "madam". Also when I should pay my bill with a Visa card, I actually had to join the waiters into the kitchen to press my pin code. Did not see that coming!All in all; if only for the food - go there. If you are travelling alone - go to Sky on 57 or BLU on Shangri-La instead
