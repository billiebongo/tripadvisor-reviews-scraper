recommended by a friend for our Christmas gathering.
the food was yummy delicious and the environment is really conducive for a small group gathering wit h both indoor and outdoor seating.
chicken wings, chicken skin, pork belly, tamago are worth going for

Visited this izakaya twice cos I really love their food. Especially their ochazuke. The perfect food to end our feasting. Their yakitori was really good too. Potato salad too.
5
The serving is very good. Diners would also be given to have salad as part of their meals. The food is delicious. They have limited menu during lunch but for sure you would be satisfied.
4
Great place to chill. Good selection of sake. Lots of food selection too. We had a fish, a few skewers and a sashimi dish. We were too excited and forgot to take photos. Definitely will return.
5
Good food with a great variety of choices. Good service, prompt and friendly. Ilove their grilled omakase. A must try.
5
Enjoy this cozy place where the stick prepared right in front of you catch your breath. I asked for a combo and started with prawn tempura following by three sticks, all cooked superbly. Service is freindsly and efficicient, beer on draft is cold and nice. Good for a relaxed evening out..

Came here with my colleagues for dinner — one of them Japanese - who ordered a large variety of dishes for us, all of which were delicious. Really enjoyed the dinner here in a relaxed atmosphere. Service was a bit detached but very efficient. Cannot say anything about the prices for the food, drinks were a bit expensive but not overpriced for Singapore standards. Definitely a good place if you want authentic Japanese food

Average at best food. Menu is not very clear, lot's of small plates and very hard to choose from if you are not very familiar with Japanese food. Although prices are not outrageously high, I have found them too high for the quality being served. Nice staff but were not helpful on advising what to order from the menu
5
I have eaten at this place many times. The food is excellent and the staff friendly.The slow cooked pork belly is one of the best I have tasted. It is a great place to have a few small dishes to get a variety of tastes.The prices are reasonable.I will continue to be a regular customer here
4
Good food with abundant choices in traditional environment at a reasonable price. What else you can ask for! Enjoy it...
5
japanese food there is pretty authentic, service is friendly and prompt as well, and has a nice relaxing vibe. located along the outer perimeter of the mall.
5
There are no pictures on the menu, which is a good sign. There are also a lot of Japanese customers which is another good sign. Did not disappoint. The food was amazing.

I'm referring to the restaurant's policy of no sharing of food. Each diner must place an order even if only a salad. I don't get it though. The servings are big and there is a chance that diners cannot finish the food. Hence, I feel that sharing should be allowed, else food will be wasted. Anyway, despite that strange policy, the food at this restaurant is worth recommending to friends. Quantity and quality are guaranteed. Our group ordered various items - gyuudon, chicken Katsu curry, grilled fish set meal, and ramen. Diners are allowed to get salad from the bar to accompany the ordered dishes. The salad itself is heavy and filling. The gyuudon was expectedly good. Nice touch of soft boiled egg to add on top of the donburi. I just wished that the thin beef could be more fat free. Other gyuudon chains in Japan have their beef slices with more meat than fat.Nevertheless, our lunch provided a good dining experience for everyone in the group. I recommend this restaurant for its food quality and nice Japanese ambience

It's almost difficult to share this gem of a find as I'm so fearful that it'd be swamped by patrons hereafter. It's not easy to find good yakitori in Singapore and this truly ranks as one of the best. Love their onsen egg pork rice bowl. They also do an interesting draught beef that's a mix between the dark and light varieties. The dÃ©cor and atmosphere is really authentic as well. You know you've found the right place when you see Japanese executives dining there

So I've walked passed the Public Izakaya countless times on my way to meetings (it's near some office buildings) but I've never thought to go in for a meal until recently when a friend suggested having a meal here. We ended up having a fantastic meal and I've since tried their other outlet (Public Izakaya 2) just across the street which is equally good. I will be going again really soon as I really love the vibe, good food and drinks. It's a good idea to book if you are going on the weekends as the place gets crowded. Also service can get a little patchy when it gets busy but hey, take a chill pill and relax, the service staff are doing their best. The plan now is to work our way down the menu to discover more gems

Had a quick dinner on a Sunday night. Service was good, design was nice. I found most of the food to be a bit too oily to my liking. Overall a decent selection of food but I would not go out of the way to come to this restaurant.
5
Our party of 5 went there on a Sunday night for dinner, it was not crowded at about 6.45pm but crowd stream in after 7pm. Upon entry, we were like transported to any of the izakayas in Japan, love the setup. After selecting some of the items, the wait staff suggested the Buta Kakumi to be a 'must-try'. Food came without much delays and we were impressed with the quality of the food. Especially enjoyed the Buta Kakumi as suggested and also the Oden, which came in a reasonably good portion. The skewer items were good too. Wait staff were helpful, attentive, prompt in topping up hot tea and we went away, vowing to be back
4
As with all izakayas, the food doesn't come cheap. But the quality and setting is well worth the price tag.We visited the branch off Enggor Street, were over zealous and ordered way too much for 2. Love that the ramen comes in a half portion so you could actually stuff yourself with other items like the skewers and sides. The scallops and sashimi were very fresh and came in thick succulent pieces. We also liked the firefly squid (which the waiter cautioned us against, saying only the Japanese eat it). I found the char siew a tad too salty though. There were a good number of Japanese customers, which to me, was a stamp of approval of authentic food.

Went there with a friend to celebrate his birthday. Not my first time there but time and again, the food and service have wowed me. Fantastic highballs, coupled with some of the best Japanese bar food in Singapore! The tori Karaage is totally worth it! Big juicy chunky chicken! They also do a lovely grilled mentaiko, perfect accompaniment to drinks! But the ultimate would be the braised pork belly! Melts in your mouth and with an onsen egg to thicken the sauce! Service always prompt, efficient without sacrificing the personal touch! All the staff and supervisors deserve an award for excellent service!Will definitely come back anytime I'm in the mood for some sinful Japanese bar food, coupled with many highballs/beers
4
Delicious, but a bit pricey for small portions. Big variety of Japanese fine food and drinks. Busy, book in advance.
5
Sat at the bar and enjoyed the wooden interior design and atmosphere. Plenty to choose from on the menu. We order various meat skewers, mackerel and fresh oysters. Quality was great and went well with the beer. Overall a great experience and will certainly return.
4
Really like going here for dinner when I'm in town as it has good quality and staff. Love the odon they do but the restaurants (they are 2 I know of in Singapore) are not cheap.
4
First visit good food and costly. The service was great. Staff are very attentive. Love the grilled selections and beef udon. Yummy !
5
The owner has spent quite a number years in Japan, studying their culture and their cuisine. He pays great attention to the fine details in the shop decoration. By having indoor and outdoor sittings, the restaurant appeals to the white collars who will hang around after work for BBQ skewers, together with hot or cold sake. Their sake selection is excellent.Besides BBQ skewers of chicken meat, meat balls, bacon stuffed with mozarella and blue cheese, the restaurant also serves beef croquets, fresh oysters, raw maguro/uni (sea urchin) blended with fresh strips of onions, together with slices of Garlic Bread. The last item is off the menu. All these food are perfect compliments to sake
4
we went there for lunch - it is best to be early as it gets crowded fast. the set meal comes with free salad from the salad table - the salad bowl is really cool - love that you can have a pick of the 5 items which are all very nice. the lunch set is reasonable and varied. the grilled saba which i had is really good. good service - free refill of the green tea. it gets crowded around 12noon. worth a try
5
We actually went to the one near here located at 16 Engoor St twice it was so good. Admittedly we got a little carried away and the first visit turned out expensive but still enjyable. The food was so nice we actually oreded 2 helpings of the pig's feet. We also ordered a bottle of Sake which was nice as well. They have Suntory beer on tap ( light and dark) and unlike many other places in Singapore they know howto pull a beer. The decor of the place is great and the staff speak gret English and will help with recommendations from the extensive menu. It was so nice we went back again and enjoyed it as much second time round.
3
The lunch comes with a salad bar and turns out that the salad bar is much better than the entree. The rice does not taste like it is from Hokkaido. The pork is a bit overcooked. However, the price is by no means like hawker stalls. So I Guess I won't visit them any time soon ..
4
We just had to try this place as it is easily noticeable from outside. You can watch the "public" of people and cars go by if you are seated outside, not in anyway negative though. In fact, that is one of the reasons I enjoyed my first dining experience here. It provides a casual atmosphere wherein guests can freely talk (noisily is alright) and enjoy the different food it offers.Whether it's ice cold dark beer or light Tiger, it will go well with any of the following: edamame, yakitori (grilled chicken) , asparagus, tebasaki (fried chicken wings), meatballs and many others. We experienced good service, too, as waitresses were attentive to our calls. Deserving of a return visit to try other menu items.

Heading says it all.We sat indoors with seating by the sushi counter. Indoor seating tables are limited, but counter seating is great fun. They have plenty of seats outside but no aircon.The food was amazing, oysters were fresh and large. The pork belly was tender and full of flavour. Karage chicken is the largest I have seen. Wagyu skewers are so tasty.Service may be a little slow in peak hours (it's packed on Friday nights). But still a great location to drink sake and enjoy great food.Fantastic Japanese gastro pub
4
What a find. I was taken here my last day for lunch. The pork rice was amazing and tender. The salad bar was fresh and great flavour. I can see this becoming s favourite
4
Public Izakaya has a very nice & healthy salad. Chicken thigh skewers are tender & tasty with light teriyaki sauce. We had gizzard, liver, chicken wing, shishito peppers, mushroom were just ordinary.
Pleasant experience & service too. Will definitely return to try other items!
4
Tucked in a corner of 100AM building is this cozy Izakaya. Servings are generous, prices are affordable and the ambience is relax. Very good place for after work drinks!

Wowww...fantastic food...today is my second visit.. In 3 days. So much varieties to try. price is very reasonable. Must try

'The Public Izakaya' by Hachi Restaurant at Amara Hotel serves good Japanese food. I meant - proper food that is profoundly handcrafted by the Japanese and Local Chefs for any Japanese food lover! These are my orders;1) Nama Kaki (live oyster with Momiji oroshi and ponzu)Comments: like an angel descended from heaven, mighty fresh! 2) Toka-wasabi (Octopus with chinimi with wasabi - marinated)Comments: A small dish meant for beer sessions with buddies’ kind of food. Not a common type of food somehow.3) Assortment of Japanese pickles (a few kinds on a small plate)Comments: This just fell below my expectation for pickles. The America Pickles can top this anytime. If you are drinking beer, then those cut pickles can be refreshingly mouth soothing.4) Buta Kanuni (Slow-simmered Iberico, Pork belly served with soft-boiled egg)Comments: Felt the hugging love from the pig. The pork belly tasted like soft baby love. Juicy texture, easy to eat - GREAT TASTE! The soft-boiled egg is such an excellent combination along with the pork belly. Best eat with rice or soba. A MUST TRY dish. Don't step out of the restaurant without trying this 'friendly-to-your-soul' food.5) Cabbage Miso (Cabbage with spicy red miso dressing).Comments: Don’t look down on this cabbage with its mere dressing. Take the cabbage and dip it in the dressing and then say if you like it - its refreshingly orgasmic.Overall Ambiance:As good as being in Japan.Service level:Normal. In fact, chatted with the chef on what to try for my next visit. lolPrice/Value:Reasonably priced. Some item can be expensive. But the taste is out of the world.Would I go again?OMG, YES! With friends and loved ones indefinitely

Overall the food quality and taste is mediocre but what puts us off the most is the service of the waitress named MELISSA. We visited the restaurant during lunch time on 1st July. Firstly, she told us off when we were considering to share our dishes, saying that it is their company policy of not allowing guests to share food. As if that was not ridiculous enough, when I was deciding on my order, She walked over and scolded me saying that if I dont quickly decide on my order, she will not allow the rest of the group to proceed to get food from their salad bar even though they have confirmed their order. Her attitude was horrendous and was definitely not the type of service you will expect from a restaurant, any service staff from a regular coffee shop would easily beat her in terms of service. This whole experience is horrible and will definitely not return anymore

A GREAT find in Singapore and I am looking forward to returning really soon. It took the team a little while to work out that our group of 10 were in for the long haul and that they needed to keep the drinks flowing but once they did things couldn't have been much better!Really nice group of people, casual and full of helpful recommendations. We covered the entire menu and everything was delicious and took us straight back to izakaya memories in various parts of Japan. Really good.The clams in sake were excellent and we worked our way through 4 pans of them.We meant to go on afterwards but ended up spending 5 hours here, that pretty much sums it up! The staff closed up and left us sitting at our fully stocked table, you can't ask for much more than that!It worked out at SGD 125 per head and we were going for it.Looking forward to returning very soon

The prices of the skewers might not seem cheap at first sight, but you will be pleasantly surprised be the chunks of tender and delish meat they put on each. The two of us had an omakase set of 10 skewers ($38), iberico braised pork ($14) and cold soba and we were happily stuffed. A true izakaya experience must include sake and beer, both of which were reasonably priced.
3
One on 100 Tras St, 079027and the other in Enggor St near by.100 Tras st was nice food service was also ok until we said we didn't want another beer then the service went down hill, I found the food ok with a sky high price for what was served.I didn't know that the Enggor St restaurant was the same name as the nearby one in Tras, until ordered, again the service was good, the food was ok but I thought it was expensive for the amount we got.Would I recommend to others no, would I attend again not really unless it was really raining and I was hungry and too lazy to walk further
5
Yes, it's Singapore and therefore it makes this place less smokier and cleaner than a yakitori ship in Japan but it makes damn good skewers of all sorts and a great selection of sake somewhat reasonably priced by Singapore standard. The best dish here is 'buta no kakuni', which is a braised pork belly with poached egg. It's simply divine. It's busy so don't expect an attentive service; it's an izakaya, not a fancy restaurant. The grill master is very nice and we had a few exchanges of sake and beer
5
At $88, the omakase is simply food value for money. Produce is very fresh. The rice used for the sushi is marvelous. It is mixed with a red vinegar specially prepared by the chef. The lumberjack fish head is grilled to perfection. Service is fantastic.
4
The omakase grilled skewers are definitely a must order - grilled to perfection and a great variety. But the highlight of the night was the kani gratin - the potatoes, cream cheese and crab meat combo was mouthwatering. Basically: sin in a shell.

While being a really cool place to hangout for happy hour (recommended outdoor for happy-hour for people-watching), it is an equally nice place for family dining (this, indoor recommended). It is recommended to reserve your table at least 2 weeks in advance if you would like an indoor table. We ordered a variety of skewers which are all too yummy to pair with sake (not sure about beer, which I don't drink). The chef-selection skewer set is highly recommended; when you order that at different time of the evening, the skewer combinations will come out different because (duh!) it's the chef's selection depending on what he is making at that moment! There's also this drink called the dark Hoppy, contained only 1% alcohol and taste exactly like a beer. So you can have beer with its malts without getting drunk on alcohol! I couldn't find this drink outside at any Japanese supermarts though

Was there on a Sat in late Oct 2015. There was a very big group of Japanese men having their dinner with drinks. If you see Japanese having meals at a certain Japanese restaurant its a sign that you are at the right place. Decor is very Japanese and atmosphere is fabulous. Owners did a fantastic job in doing up this place.Between the 2 of us, we ordered:--2 white and 1 black beer (I prefer the white one while partner prefers the black)-Chicken Ball with Daikon soup - Excellent (must order) -Slow-Simmered Iberico Pork Belly-Excellent (Die, die must try. It's so good, 1 portion its not enough.)-Bluefin Tuna Tartare with uni (Very good, very appetizing) -Seared Bonito Sashimi (Very Good- Goes well with Beer)-Home-made Deep Fried Croquette with Gyoza Stuffing (Excellent)-Smoked Duck with soy sauce marinated mozzarella (Good but I found the combination a little too salty)-Momotaro- (for people who loves to eat tomatoes)-Cabbage with miso dip (its raw cabbage with miso dip)Although we have ordered so much food surprisingly the bill came out to be very reasonable. Recommended a few of the dishes we have tried to the patron at the next table and we could see that they were all happily enjoying their meal.Will definitely return to try more of the other dishes
4
The restaurant is a small cozy one that cater only 3 tables indoor and remaining are bar seats. The rest are outdoor. We sat indoor. The food was good. Not too large not too small. The taste was just nice for the palette. The pork belly is worth the mention. The Suntory Malt was good although it could be better if its a pint instead of half. The cloudy sake was a good kick to finish off a wonderful dinner. A great place for a catch up with family and friends.

Was at Izakaya Public 2 at Icon Village (just 2 minutes walk across the street from 100AM)Made reservation for lunch a day before. Had a call from restaurant about an hour before my reservation time (appreciated the courtesy call).However, I was disappointed with the service the minute I stepped into the restaurant. Despite making a reservation a day earlier, I was directed to the seats at the counter nearest to the door... the worst "table" in the restaurant. I was reluctantly redirected to a proper table after complaining to the waitress. I was even more disappointed when the manager came forward to apologise. Although she was cordial and polite, she explained that it is their usual practice to place reservation for 2 at the counter... "unless customer request a table"Food was average at best. Nothing to write home about. Their portion though was quite generous.I would have rated them 4 stars if not for the insensitive service. I did not feel welcome at all
4
Decór of this place is nice, although the place is inside a condo service area of sorts. If you haven't been to an Izakaya experience in Japan (like me), and don't know the dishes well, this could be a daunting menu experience. I failed at it at first time and ordered things I imagined were something else. Best strategy for this place — if you are new to the japanese "tapas" style — is to look at the other tables, spot the things that look yummy, and ask the waiters for the same. Together with an Asahi Extra Dry beer. That should do the trick
4
Went in and sit by the counter as requested. Service staff could have done a better service by being more attentive and clear our plates, I can understand the floor plan is hard to see every table as there is private and outdoor seating. Was warmly served by the Japanese chef, the oysters are good. My favourite dish was the monkfish liver, there is no strong fishy flavour, in fact it can be comparable to foie gras. The oden set was flavourful, however the egg could be cook like a volcano egg, the dish will be perfect otherwise.Sashimi moriwase was well - prepared by the chef, one of the finest flavour I had from the ocean. The yakitoris had awesome marinated and charred flavour, it may be too savoury for specific group. Overall, the ambience gave me a feeling of being in an authentic Japanese setting. Would go back again for the monkfish liver
3
We were at the Public Izakaya 2 at Icon Village, just a minute's walk from their first outlet in 100AM. This place probably spent a lot of money to recreate a typical Izakaya in Singapore. The tomato appetizer, skewered pork and karaage chicken were good, however, the grilled chicken wings were too salty, the ox tongue too tough and the wagyu a bit too fatty. Bill came up to $60 per person (with drinks). Food also came slowly, one dish at a time
5
I absolutely love it here! I have recommended many of my friends to visit - and they have with many more repeat visits. My most recommended dish is the melt-in-your-mouth braised pork belly with soft boiled egg - oh my! Another must-have is the camembert with crackers - who can say no to warm, melted camembert?! I also love their maguro sashimi and oden, with hubby telling me the fist-sized chicken karaage is a must. Perfect with a tower of Asahi beer, shared with friends :)Try to book ahead and ask for a table indoors - it can get very hot outside
