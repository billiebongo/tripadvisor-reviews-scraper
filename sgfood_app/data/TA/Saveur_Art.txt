Ambience is quiet and suitable for meetings. Customer service should put on a smile more. Customer service should also be more alert in looking out for customers who need help.
5
Food is presented in a spectacular way. Everything we tried so far tastes fantastic. The onion soup was surprisingly yummy!
5
I always order the meal set here which cost around S$40 and really enjoy the food. Almost all the food I have tried are tasty: Duck confit, salmon confit, etc.
4
Food served was tasty and potion was just nice.
Try the duck confit, seabass, chicken and beef. Beef was very delicious and it come with mash potatoe. Try the bread basket, bread was warm and it goes well with the butter.
Dessert was delicious too.
5
I came here with my girlfriend on Saturday afternoon for high tea and the art tea experience set was so good value for money! The coffee was so fragrant and delicious. I would definitely come back.
4
Location was great though getting to the car park and finding a lot in the evening is a challenge. Set up of restaurant was simple. Food was 5 stars! We had the set dinner with starter , dessert and house wine. When our dessert came, there was another plate of free dessert for us. It was a pleasant surprise but we were too full from dinner to eat it. What a Pity! Perhaps to give the free dessert and change the set dinner menu to another item? Service needs to be improved in terms of details and promptness
5
This is undoubtedly one of the greatest places to have a nice meal at. The ala carte price is very reasonable and it's set menus are a must try. Not only is the interior clean and cosy, all the dishes presented were very beautiful and tasted really good Two thumbs u
4
Was pleasantly surprised that the afternoon tea set has got quite a few varieties of savouries and sweets. Quality was good, except for their selection of teas which were limited and bland. Service was also slow and it took a while for us to get their attention throughout the entire meal. (waited 20mins for our afternoon tea set although restaurant was a third full, took considerable effort to have our teas filled, grouchy staff) I would come back again purely for the value for money afternoon tea set.
4
Had the set lunch with additional starter of foie gras which was perfectly seated and topped with apples and accompanied by an excellent green salad with walnuts and cheese. Main dish of duck confit was relatively good except I found the gravy a tad too salty. My friend has the Sea bass which according to her was succulent and excellent... perhaps rubbing it i when I said my duck was tad salty.Service was good ...Not intrusive as it was a good meet up with some old friends for lunch. Price was reasonable but overall nice atmosphere
4
First time having a meal here. I've longed enjoyed Saveur at Far East Plaza, but I like the quiet and classy feel of Saveur Art. The staff were attentive, the food was good and the set dinner was value for money. Fine dining at almost a third of the usual price. Winning formula I reckon. Will be back for sure
4
It's return visit for dinner. The restaurant maintain same standard as last time. Recommended seabass and creme br√ªl√©e
4
Top up for the duck salad for the appetiser! Duck confit was the highlight of the day. The mushroom pasta was also very good. I got the creme br√ªl√©e for the dessert and it was also very delicate.
4
Value for money. Duck leg was a bit salty. Beef was alright. Dessert and pasta was good. Lunch set menu was quite ok.
4
Some of the staff could handle our queries better. It may sound like a stupid question but she could have handled it better with a smile and not a frown.
4
Portion is good for ladies. Food is good. Website should indicate the timing for lunch & tea to make sure no disappointment.
4
The dinner is well-served. But the duck confit was a bit salty. The beef bourguignon was abit little. I was hoping for steak I love the foie gras. Yummy
4
I dont quite like the skin of the sea bass, but overall is OK. The Foie Gras was fantastic. Pan seared to perfection.
Even my British friend likes it a lot.
The ambience was like average restaurants, not quite like a fine dining place.
2
I was expecting much better in term of food quality, service was Ok.
Way too expensive compare to other restaurant in the same quality range
5
Was politely greeted with a warm smile by a lady manager (I presume). She confirmed my reservation for 2 and we were quickly shown to our table. Ordering and food service was very smooth. Staff were polite and efficient. Cutlery n environment very clean. Set dinner value for money. Delicious n dessert was wonderful! Will be so going back again soon! Thanks to all the staff especially the lady manager :)
3
Food was great and value for money. Unfortunately, service fell terribly short. The restaurant refused to offer a corner table despite a polite request, and insisted that it was reserved. We dined and left 2 hours later, only to find that the table we requested for was still empty.
4
Tried a good spread of food on A weekday evening... All in all a good experience. The best dish was probably the truffle egg confit !
4
We had a really good experience at the restaurant. The staff are all friendly and attentive. My Friend who's celebrating her bday and love French cuisine enjoyed every bit of it...
3
The food presentation was superb but the taste was just alright. Didn't expect this restaurant to charge on drinking water for what we are paying for the items on menu.
3
Value for money high tea set, good place to chit chat with friends. Food is so so but acceptable, not outstanding quality.
4
Value for money set dinner with good variety. Convenient location and attentive service.
Restaurant was however extremely noisy due to patrons talking at the top of their voice and children playing.
4
Wonderful high tea set for two, which was a mix of delicious savoury and sweet treats. Good coffee too. Very good value and convenient location.
4
I have visited Saveur many times and it's always a good dining experience. Staff are attentive, food standard always remains high.
5
Went there with my husband to try their new set dinner and premium set dinner menu. Feel that the foie gras can be better if it was pan-seared. Main courses and desserts were good.
2
we have been eating at various Saveur outlets for years, and always loved the food. On this trip, the restaurant was half empty but the staff was inattentive and clearly not wanting to be at work. They would bring out 4 out of 5 place settings, too few water glasses, and served the plates of food in the middle of the table and walk away. (This is not a family style restaurant.) Worst of all, it was not made known to us that chope dollars would only be used on a la carte items, and they would not let us split the bill. (It is heavily promoted as a set meal restaurant, we were given five set meal menus and only one a la carte.) Betwen the lackluster service and the standard rigid/unhelpful attitude, we will never visit again. That is too bad, the food was lovely
3
Visited a few of saveur art restaurants but i think i should give some comments on my recent visit to the one at Ion.To be honest the restaurant decor and ambience is far the best among other branches but it seems the food and staff service is the worst among all.First, the food served is not hot and it seems they are just merely warmed from the microwave.Second, staff service is extremely not up to standard and definitely would need training again.If you have the choice, try other branches instead.Dr E Chow
3
Had to top up $3 for ice lemon tea.
Duck confit was so so... not tender
Celebrated father's day.
I had requested for a candle for my husband's dessert but nothing done
Pear dessert was tiny.
Disappointed.
5
Unbelievable value for the set lunch & set dinner. Ala carte menu is also reasonably priced... the service staff were attentively and offered timely service...
5
High quality ingredients present in gourmet styled dishes. Excellent food in a chill out ambience, with well spaced out tables. Not to be missed!
2
The food is really average, the Duck confit is no tasty and lack of cooking. But the worth is the service or more the lack of service. They are always hiding behind obviously not happy to work here .
4
Treated my BFF to lunch. Nice ambience to chat and dine. Good value and tasty set lunch. We enjoyed the duck confit and seabass. Good service too.
4
Set menu price at $29.90 was reasonable. The duck confit was good. There was 5 of us, when the dessert was served most of the ice cream is melted.... room for improvement.
3
We ordered the angel pasta as starter which is nice. However the sea bass is a little too dry and the sauce for beef bourguignon too salty. Dessert of the choc lave cake is decent.
4
Food is nice with good ambience. Duck confit is the specialty and its tender and tasty. The shrimp pasta with thin noodles is great too. üëç
5
Value for money and food is pleasantly surprisingly good. Portion is of decent size too. Will return
4
I went with a group of colleagues from work. I asked for the menu: salmon, pork belly, and pistachio panna cotta. Unfortunately I've never had the opportunity to try the salmon as they run out, I understand the mistake as we were many asking for the same dish. I asked for the onion soup instead. The soup was ok, the onions were to hard and not melting in your mouth like they are supposed to. Pork belly was truly very good and soft with crunchy skin, but the beans were definitely too hard, finally the Panna cotta was AMAZING (I end up eating two...), but they should change the name because it was NOT a panna cotta, it was a very good pistachio mouse like dessert, but definitely not a panna cotta. Overall I give it 4 stars because food was good in general for the price of the menu and service was attentive
4
Another alternative to saveur, the more atas and pricey but a little bigger portion then the original. Service was abit slow despite little patrons and food presentation was presented different from the original seveur. Good ambience for after work chillax.
4
Try the Saveur Pasta ($4.90) and the recommended Sea Bass. The Duck Confit is nice, but some parts tasted a bit salty
4
Friendly service. Nice food presentation. Tho place was a little too noisy. Overall was a pleasant experience.
4
Brought the family out for dinner. The food was great and the set dinner was great value for money. The staff were pretty understaffed though and it was hard to get their attention.
3
I love the Rose tea. We hope the food portions bigger and more choice. Looking forward for the new menus.
5
It was good! The location is easy to find, service was great, food was good too. Really quality tea time for a very reasonable price!
5
I was pleasantly surprised with my recent visit to Saveur Art. I knew it would be wallet-friendly for its cuisine, and that it would be value-for-money, but I didn't expect such a well-cooked meal and fantastic service.It was a 3-course lunch set.The Saveur pasta was excellent as usual.Their seabass was fantastic; the fish was perfectly cooked, flesh was firm, skin was crispy. The side of vegetables cooked with vinegar and mustard sauce complemented the fish very well. It was a well-balanced dish I enjoyed very much.The dessert of the day was poached pear (in lemon?), which was AMAZING with my glass of white wine (Jean Pierre Colombard Chardonnay). Not sure if it was intended, but the strong pear and green apples in the wine was a perfect pairing with the pear and its lemon flavours.I could only leave impressed with the whole dining experience
2
Well, where do I start...I'd been to Saveur when they were just starting out. I've been to Saveur at Cathay and I was certainly expecting better when I made a reservation at Saveur Art. Unfortunately it put a bit of a downer on a date night Mother's Day dinner. Both of us ordered the premium dinner set and while there are premium dishes or ingredients in it, the cooking was certainly not premium. The extra starter plates were a nice surprise but disappointing. It was a seafood dish and it was fishy and drowned in lime. My partner chose the foie gras and when it came, there wasn't any good sear nor seasoning on it. It was dull and flabby and bland and had criss-cross grill marks on it of the type you find in western hawker stalls selling steak. Where they simply press a heated pattern on top of the meat to create the impression of a grill. My egg confit was marred by the discovery of two extremely burnt macadamias. It made me think the kitchen either wasn't particular, or hadn't bothered to look at what they were serving. While overall it wasn't bad, I felt like I should be eating it as a breakfast dish rather than as an appetiser. We had ordered the beef rossini as mains (foie gras on top) and surprise surprise, the foie gras turned out exactly the same as the appetiser. They hadn't realised they had to time the carrots differently so we each got two smaller baby carrots cooked, and one larger baby carrot verging on raw. They did get the doneness of the beef right. Would have maybe preferred a juicier cut. I really don't get what the toast is there for. Just to add to the presentation maybe, because it didn't add to the dish. Second small surprise plate was served. A strawberry sorbet on something burnt. I'm assuming it was burnt nuts, because it was so burnt I could barely tell. Dessert was the most disappointing of all. Strawberry Mille Feuille. Strawberries were fresh. Vanilla cream was nice. Ice cream accompaniment was a bit strange (also, btw, placed on something burnt) and the pastry looked and tasted like it had been taken out of a freezer box, baked for a minute and then sent out. Mine was so pale it was almost white. No crispness, no toastiness, no colour! Yes, you're getting this at a price half that of fine dining restaurants, but even at this price the cooking, in many instances, is sub-par. It seems like the kitchen doesn't care, or doesn't know what they send out to customers. So much for a "premium" dinner. I will say, that service was good. Attentive, prompt and polite. Although I did notice, they never did ask us about how the food was
3
This place is located in at Orchard Ion at level 4 and is easily accessible from Orchard train station (Red Line). Had the set lunch which comes with a starter, main course and dessert which is about SGD 25. You can top up for drinks at about a few dollars more. The starters and dessert taste great. But the main course (Roasted Pork Belly) that I had was a little bad. There was a taste of this burned smell (not on the meat) on the gravy that comes with peas, beans and carrots. When asked the service staffs, they say it's actually the smoked taste. Whatever the taste is, it just taste really weird and I couldn't just carry on with the meal. Had also tried the duck confit and it was a little salty but over all not too bad. The portion of all the main courses are just average. Some people might find it small. Despite the weird taste on my main course. I think overall experience it's still not too bad. The restaurant deco and layout is simple and clean. Service are ok but kinda slow but understand that it's lunch time.
3
I had the art tea experience set with my partner. The coffee machine was faulty and we could not get both of our hot coffees. When I requested a free upgrade to premium tea, they accepted my request so that was nice. Service from the wait staff was inconsistent, some were nice and some were not friendly.Food was average with the savouries needing room for improvement in taste. Sweets were good, I enjoyed the macaroons
4
Warm ambience, good for relaxing lunch dates. 3 course lunch menu is pretty value-for-money. Friendly and prompt service too.
2
The tea was cheap $22 for 2 but the quality of the food is so-so, nothing to rave about. Service was not very good. Staff had a long face. Unfriendly.
1
The place was short of staff. Slow service. The salmon had a very strong fish smell. Pork belly also had a very strong smell.
4
The food was good and at good value, but such a pity that the tea selection was not as promised (chamomile missing) , and coffee was not available as they said the machine was not working.
3
I did not have much expectations of the food and true to my expectations it was ordinary fare. Had better elsewhere.
Service was so-so too
4
We happened to dine there during their 6th birthday and we have 3 April babies with us and so enjoyed a very generous promo with Saveur Art. The food is good and we have a good experience with the restaurant.
3
Serving of main dishes took too long. Their starter, main dishes and dessert (cake with ice-cream) was delicious.
5
Great location. Good place to have teas or lunch or dinner after a shopping day out with friends. Food is good and reasonable price.
3
Staff were super unfriendly, especially one of the girls who literally ignored me when I was speaking with her to place my order and she gave such a bad attitude, the look on her face was like as if I was really bothering her!! How can you have someone like that in the service industry. The food isn't that cheap, and i believe patrons would at least expect a bare minimum of service level. The food was good, but unfortunately the service was terrible, so the overall experience was terrible as well!
5
Value is a word that must be frequently used on this place. And I must add that other than value this place has great service and truly a forerunner in affordable dining that is stays true to the cuisine.Dinner set here is $29.90 for 3 courses. They don't scrimp in the quality
4
Good food good art on plate. Brought my client from overseas and he is pleased as well. It is a pleasant dinner.
4
The food is savy and tasty, only the selection of food is a limited. But you cannot find other affordable French cuisine in town. The service is a pleasant one with all the smiles always.
4
Overall ambience and service was pretty nice. Food was pretty good too (similar to that of the usual saveur).
5
Simply affordable fine dining place with instagram worthy food presentation. Would definitely recommend friends here for a get together or celebration dinner.
3
The change in the menu makes it too similar to other outlets and lost the meaning in "Art", I was expecting more.
5
Love the food and ambiance. Service was prompt and with little surprises here and there, like the pre-dessert dessert.
4
Second visit..food was nice however feel that the service was not attentive enough. Need to wait for quite awhile to request for menu or water refills.
5
Excellent food and service, would definitely return for a second time. Do try the duck confit and the grilled fish !
4
Great set of sweet and savoury nibbles for the afternoon tea at a reasonable price of $32 ++. Unfortunately if you are not up to a tea, they don't serve anything else to eat between 3pm and 6pm.
2
The Chicken Tarragon was undercooked and cold. Duck Confit was very, very salty and lukewarm. Plating was dismal and the place had poor atmosphere. The food tasted like they were precooked and heated up with a microwave.Overall, the place reminds me of a caf√É¬© than a restaurant. The food was actually mediocre. There was a 1 for 1 main course offer but even with the offer I think it was a disappointment and won't bother again. I left knowing I had dinner but wishing it never happened
4
Everything was good. The food to the taste to the ambience.
Something puzzled me though. They didnt pick up my call hence i went ahead to online reservation. 8pm was full. So i took 8.15pm. But when i arrived at 8.05pm, it was half empty.
3
Was served pastry dessert that was burnt at the bottom and tasted bitter. Informed the staff and just received a nod. No apologies, no service recovery.
5
love the food, good value for nice atmosphere and french food. do note that chope vouchers can only be used for a la carte menu. can't use it for the 1 for 1 main course and the 3 course set meal.
2
I liked how the restaurant has a one for one offer on the mains. What was disappointing was the food since there were many cracked shell bits in my food. Staff on the other hand were pretty attentive and I appreciate the service.
5
though it has limited selection on it's menu, the overall value & quality outweighs it. I'm a repeated customer & shall be back for more
5
Went there for birthday celebration, food was great and services was superb! The staff was friendly and offered to help us with the birthday day cake. They make our day :)
5
I chose Saveur Art to celebrate my birthday with my family and have no regrets. It was rather empty on a Sunday evening in this casual bistro setting, and service was fairly prompt and attentive. We all tried the 3-course degustation menu and was roundly impressed. The French flair showed up well in the presentation and creative yet comforting flavors of the dishes. The Egg Confit appetizer - one of their signature dishes - was remarkable tasty with its heady mix of textures and umami taste. Also outstanding was the lobster which, while shelled, offered amazing tenderness and aroma. We will certainly come back for another visit
4
We were celebrating birthday at Saveur Art, I reserved table for 2 and my friend came earlier and was ushered to a non-reserved table even though she mentioned my name and the reservation. Only when I arrived and I mentioned about my reservation twice and finally we gotten the reserved table (which is nicer than a 2 seated square table). All in all the food is GREAT, service (after the table-matter) is up to expectation. The chef gave us a little choc written Happy Birthday, that's a nice touch. Will come again
5
The food was well presented and the staff are very friendly. When we asked for bread, they took extra mile and heated up the bread and serve with butter. They also paid close attention to the dessert my boyfriend ordered and put a beautiful candle and happy birthday chocolate on it. Thank you very much!
5
I'm very particular when it comes to the food I eat and the ambiance of the place I eat in. Saveur Art simply excels in every way. My family and I ate in this resto around 5 times in our 2-week stay in Singapore. Each time, the food was exemplary. We ordered different items on the menu, but not a single dish has fallen even in the "normal" category. The menu options do not offer a wide variety, but that is certainly no problem because their food is the kind that keeps you coming back for more. The ambiance is peaceful -- its location on this floor of the mall is relatively quiet. The service was wonderful too! Given the quality of the food, I found the pricing more than worth it.From appetizer to dessert, everything was just perfect. Kudos to the chefs and staff
5
We had Egg confit, lobster angel hair pasta, crispy duck leg confit, lobster etuvee, grilled norwegian salmon, chicken tarragon & mustard, roasted french quail, mushroom pasta and chocolate & pistachio.
Every dish was delicious. Unfortunately they did not have the shaved Truffle.
4
Every dish was really pretty! Set lunch was worth it, would be abit pricey if ordered a la carte. Too bad it was a limited lunch menu during CNY period.
2
The egg confit is not as warm and portion smaller. Quail not cook. Price not worth. Disappointing birthday dinner.
4
The appetizers and desserts were amazing! The dishes were plated beautifully and they tasted as good as it looks especially the appetizers and desserts. Affordable French food!
3
A little disappointed as I had tried both Saveur and Concetto before. Therefore I had higher expectations of Saveur Art. But overall, it is still a nice place to dine at because of the environment.
4
Staff gladly attended to our special request for cosy corner and birthday dessert. Personally like the duck confit
4
The overall experience was good. Food was ok, not exceptional for something that Saveur was known for. Service is good.
4
This is the 3rd time I visited Saveur Art. Went there partly due to the 1 for 1 for main course offer which is value for money and also the ambience is very conducive for friend's gathering. It was great dining experience overall, as always been for the past few times I went
3
Had 4 course meal inclusion from the ala carte menu. Portioning is good but can be slightly highly priced. Pretty plating and nice combination. Staffs quite attentive and ambience is quite nice to have small chats. Food is very flavourful and savoury, if the first course is not to your likely try to advice the staffs to notify the kitchen to season the food lighter.
3
Food was great but the service was a let down. Had to remind the servers about my cheese platter and we also asked that dessert be served after that but it was still served to us in the middle of our meal. When we were finished and asked for dessert, the server put it on our table without clearing our empty plates or giving us new cutlery. Also, we noticed that the servers were not smiling and looked pretty moody. Such a pity..
4
The food are nice and the serving portion is just nice. I will revisit and try the other dishes. Thanks.
4
Great service with delicious food served! Will return back for more food! More to have more variety for its dessert!
4
Chance upon Saveur while trying to search for a place for gathering. Had their set lunch on boxing day and it was yummy! Definitely worth a try.
5
Reasonably priced for 3 course set lunch. Attentive staff, Tasty food. Ideal proportion. Will definitely have repeat visits!
4
Tables and seats are spacious for a good gathering. Food is good but slightly pricey if without the 1 for 1 promotion. Overall, good food, great promotion, nice ambience for gathering.
4
My wife and I had wanted to try the food at Saveur Art for some time. We ordered egg confit, duck confit & pork belly. The food was absolutely delicious.
3
Ordered the 1-for-1 promotion during dinner, which allowed me to have 2 main dishes for the price of 1 (the more expensive of the 2). I ordered the chicken tarragon and duck confit.I was disappointed when both mains arrived together because I was dining alone. I know this promotion is almost always ordered by a pair who would want their dishes to arrive together, but if service was better, they should have taken into account of such an exception.I started with the chicken tarragon, which was delicious. The chicken breast was juicy, complemented with fried bits on top of the chicken for a delicious crunch. It was served with mashed potatoes, wonderfully fragrant with the butter in it. The tarragon sauce paired very well with the chicken and vegetables. This is a dish which I will definitely order again next time.The duck confit wasn't as good, maybe because it was starting to get cold. It tasted average to me, with the sauce and potatoes lacking flavour.The Saveur restaurants have always been known for quality French fare at bargain prices, and this meal, despite the disappointments, was still very value-for-money. I would love to visit again, and I'll be explicit in reminding the service staff to not serve me 2 dishes at once
4
My friend and I went to Saveur Art and ordered the lobster angel hair pasta ($15) for starter, and the duck confit ($28) as well as the grilled norwegian salmon ($33). The mains were on 1-1 for dinner so I think it was really quite worth it for the food. I must say that I preferred the saveur pasta that the other saveurs serve as compared to the lobster angel hair pasta, but both are good :
4
Went with a friend when they had their 1 for 1 main course promotion, so it made the bill even more affordable. Between us, we shared a starter, had 2 main courses as well as a bottle of wine. Food quality is good and everything did not disappoint so it was a very pleasant dining experience
4
The setting was good for Christmas celebration and the food were overall nice in my opinion (taste is subjective for my friend who has ate in other outlets of Saveur thought that the food was slightly salty at this outlet). But the service attitude is good definitely thus we will still dine here again
5
wine and dining experience was good overall, only with slight disappointment when one of the waiters, who took order from me, was not able to match/recommend wine for my order.
4
Food was tasty but portion q small . One for one offer was worth it . 3 course Main for beef was a little exp cos needed to add extra money
4
Went there for birthday celebration. They had a 1 for 1 mains promo and we tried out 6 mains. Food was delicious. The restaurant was full despite it being a wed night. The servers were maxed out. Advisable to make reservations
5
good ambient...good service...good pricing with the 1 for 1 main course!!! It is the must restaurant to do our Christmas gift exchange!!!
3
Went for the 1 for 1 promotion on mains. Food was average. Portion was a little small though. Service was below average.
5
The service was not bad, at times they can be shorthanded but overall still acceptable.
The food serving for each menu is just enough and did not take very long to arrive.
Ambience was definitely the main selling point there, everything is almost instagrammable :)
3
Food was mediocre and did not impress. Choices of tea was disappointing and only had basic choices. Service staff was friendly and polite.
3
This is not my first visit to Saveur Art. I've always enjoy dining there. Just felt it was inflexible in allowing patrons to mix and match items from its set dinner menu. It's an area for improvement. Thanks.
4
Cosy ambience with a good variety of set meals and Ala-carte choices.
Food standard is very consistent and egg confit is 1 of our favourite!
3
We enjoyed the fois gras and duck confit dishes at this restaurant. The chicken and salmon dishes were average. We also enjoyed the clam chowder soupI probably would have given a higher rating but the service was slow and we continously had to waive down the waitress for service
4
Service staff were pretty good. Food quality is not bad but can be better given the price. Atmosphere and environment was nice, great place for catching up with friends.
5
The salmon was cooked in cream sauce with vongale
The pork belly was cooked in sour braided sauce! Very nice!
4
Great ambience!
If you like to to have a place to have tea and chat with your friends, this a great avenue
5
The service crews are professional and the food are nice. Worth a visit. Their salmon is to dieeee for. Vvv delicious!
4
The concept of the dishes are original and interesting. But importantly, the taste is great and sits well with both adults and kids.
4
Service was excellent, and the food was served pretty fast. Price may be quite steep if not for the 1 for 1 dinner. Tried the duck confit and snapper. Both taste good. Overall it was a pleasant experience.
4
We had dinner at Saveur Art. They were out of lobster and duck for the mains. That was a tad sad for me since I had my heart set on trying the lobster. Anyways, I settled for the 3 course dinner set with egg confit, salmon and chocolate dessert. This was truly value for money. My husband had the warm veggies and burata salad, followed by the mushroom pasta, ala carte.We enjoyed our appetisers a lot - beautifully plated and delicious. The mains were good, but nothing exceptional. Dessert was pretty good, so we ended on a good note. Overall we enjoyed our meal and would consider returning for affordable, but tasty french fare
2
I was here last wednesday for dinner. They were having 1 for 1 mains. it wasnt crowded. We ordered two mains and one appetizer(angelhair pasta lobster). Knowing that appetizer was supposed to be served before main course, but our mains came before our appetizer. We finished our mains and waited for the appetizer that was not in our sight. We thought maybe they were thawing the lobster.. but guess what, the customers that were seated and ordered just few minutes, had their appetizer (angel hair lobster) served almost in minutes!!! we were upset so we asked for ours. The waitress was pretty impatient when we said we ordered the angel hair pasta and it had yet to be served. She doubt our words. Did i mention she actually roll her eyes at us? so rude! So she went to check with her colleague, and discussed abit, they decided to serve. They must have thought that we ate and kept the plates. Quite disappointing actually. We can see that they were understaffed. Only see two to three servers.We had tried the bugis saveur and kinda missed the place and decided to try the one in orchard ion. I just hope that it could have been a better experience
5
Came here for lunch with wife on my day off and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and value for money. The 3-course set lunch at $29 is worth it. You add-on for some better options but chicken and duck confit is at no additional costs. We had egg confit and lobster angel hair pasta. Wonderfully delicious. Then we had salmon and quail for the mains. Looking forward to have their lobster the next time. For dinner, they have 1-for-1 offer for mains. Go for wagyu beef. 2 mains for $80!
5
Been hearing a lot about Saveur some months ago and always long queue at the bugis branch when I wanted to try. Chanced upon Saveur Art online when deciding where to eat for a meet up with friends and so booked online thru Chope. Turns out the food was better than we expected and we all love what we ordered. Besides the food was great, we were wowed by the one for one offer. Will definitely be back again to try other dishes.
4
Good food and service at reasonable prices plus the food presentation suit the saveur art. Quite a good portion for all the courses. Ideal place for business lunch without paying through your nose

Have high expectations before i went there to celebrate birthday with my bestie. Service provided was so so. Waiter insisted that i return the menu to him when i was browsing for desserts. Recommended food: egg confit and duck leg.
4
Nice ambience and good service. Food taste delicious too! It's a really good place for chill-out.
There's 1 for 1 promo for main dish. Good for trying the dishes.
3
Good food but unfortunately we got the seat near to entrance door, so lot of disturbance. Overall still a nice experience, will visit again. :)
4
1-1 deal promotion, but taste not so delicious as other saveur restaurants. Service is good, overall satisfied.
3
was there specially for lobster but it was unavailable. took two mains- salmon and quail but was rather disappointed with the food.
5
The food was excellent and service staff attentive. A cosy spot to have dinner and the menu has enough variety.
4
Ambience was good, food was great. The 1 for 1 made the meals really worthwhile. Wait staff seemed a lil overwhelmed; otherwise could have been more attentive
2
Service staff got irritated when we had asked for extra bowls and cutlery to share our appetizers. They started mopping the floor of the restaurant when we were still in it at 9.30pm. The disinfectant smell chased us out. They could have simply told us they were closing but instead chose to leave a bad taste in our mouths when we left .
3
Excellent service given by the staff who arranged a birthday-themed dessert for my order.One of my main dishes was the fish dish - I felt it could have been more well done.Expect prices to be equivalent to that of fine dining - in other words, not very value for money. 2 of us spent $110++. 2 main courses, 2 sides and 2 desserts.
3
Food was averagely done, the other outlet at purvis was nicer. service by the counter staff could have been better as well.
3
Staff should be more attentive to diners, could see restaurant were short of service staff, refill of drinking water was not automatically done i have to ask staff for more, food wise was satisfactory.
4
Great food, great ambience, great service! Favorite dishes were the duck confit and French quail on truffle mash potato.
4
Went to the ION outlet, where the buy 1 main free 1 main deal is on. Had the snapper, salmon, quail and pork. All dishes are good but I would highly recommend the quail and the pork!
4
The 1-for-1 dinner deal was really worth it. Love the salmon dish especially. However, the duck confit was a little too salty. Nevertheless it was good in general. The service and ambience was great too!
4
Went with 3 friends, the dishes looked very presentable.. however, choices are quite limited and a bit on the pricy side
4
The best part of Saveur Art is the service. But i guess the less tables filled, the better the service. The prices are almost double of the other Saveurs, i wonder why. But the one-for-one promo evens it out. Thank you, Saveur Art, for a wonderful weekday gathering of 14 friends
1
We tried the duck confit and snapper - the duck confit were dry and dark while the snapper were weird-tasting (apart from the fact that the colour of entire dish did not look appetizing at all). I don't think we got our money's worth, we certainly expected much better for this kind of pricing
4
Saveur Art has great ambiance for a nice dinner. My boyfriend and I tried their roasted chicken breast and snapper grenobloise. They were delicious! Service staff was helpful and friendly. It's a pity that the dinner crowd was small. I think not a lot of people know that they can enjoy 1-for-1 mains at Saveur Art during dinner daily.
3
was a little bit disappointed on my visit to saveur art on the 8th oct 2016. Overall it was ok but the food need more improvement as it was undercooked for one of the dish that not suppose to be. And for the popular rib eye steak it really disappoints me cause the outer crust was overly cooked and became chewy (I wanted it to be medium) . So long story short I hope you guys can have some improvement on that. Thank you 
4
The lobster was very fresh and the broth was really tasty, my table finished every drop. The pork could be more lean but the minestrone broth was quite good. The salmon was well cooked.
3
Staff are attentive & hospitable. However food is just average. When compared to Saveur, the food is not as great for the price (even with the 1-for-1 promotion.
3
Main course portion slightl little. May consider give a bigger portion instead especially for male guest
5
The set lunch was reasonably priced at 29++ with various choices for appetizer, main course as well as desserts which left us salivating even at the end. Service was great, the staff gladly arranged a surprise for our friend whose birthday we were celebrating for.
2
The waitress there can't wait to ask us to leave when we finish our food, and right after she cleared our plates, she placed the bill on our table when we didn't even asked for it. Both me and my friend were shocked. Btw, there was not even a single person queuing outside the restaurant. I don't understand what's the hurry for and the rudeness of the service? Was it because the restaurant is having promotion of 1 for 1 and that's the service we get?
2
Good location as it is at Ion, easy to find. The restaurant itself was a rather small and cosy space. Seats were good and comfortable. In this small space, there were about 4 waiters, but it was very very difficult to get the attention of the waiters to get refill of water or to pay our bill. The service was really poor; not what I would expect from Saveur Art, which I assumed was a higher end version of Saveur. One waitress was particularly aloof; even when you smile and ask your request politely, she NEVER replied with a word or a smile or even acknowledge me. If she was mute and had a badge or signed to me, I wouldn't mind (but then again mute people can smile). E.g. if I said "hi can I have more water please?" she would immediately turn her back away (to go get water), no "sure/ok/no problem" or a smile or even a nod. Food portion was smile, as with all Saveur's restaurant. Knew their duck is salty so requested for less salt to be added but still came really salty. Will not go back to the restaurant again because of their poor service
5
I was impressed when the service staff helped pair the 4 mains we ordered up to allow us to maximise the 1-for-1 dinner promo when paying the bill. We paid $38 for our 2 x $38 mains and $32 for our $32 and $30 mains. The starter of lobster angel hair pasta was a feast for our eyes and tastebuds too
4
Book a table to avoid disappointment. Reach on time and table is ready. We order 1 for 1 main course and one a la-carte to share among three adults and a kid. We all enjoy the meals and feel satisfied. But dessert vise are too sweet for our level. Definitely will come back again! Keep up the work

My girl friend and I decided to try the high tea one-for-one session after a lovely time we had at Saveur Art last year. We ordered a simple chocolate cake and tea previously and we loved the quality of the food.However, this high tea ensemble was rather disappointing. The pastries weren't anything to shout about, and overall the savoury ones tasted better than the sweet ones. I found the cheese cream on our red velvet slices nothing special, and tasted worse than Cedele's red velvet cake..The worst was the scone. It was hard as rock. We shared our feedback with the staff but she told us we should have had the scones first while it's hot from the oven. My friend bakes and good scones taste great regardless of when you eat them. Think Swissbake...Service was also a little slow even when there weren't a lot of customers around. At some point in time there was only one wait staff busy minding the whole dining area.Overall the high tea was disappointing. I think we would rather settle for normal meals from the menu than do this high tea thing again. We really love the restaurant alot because it's not overly packed and looks classy
2
The food at Purvis street outlet i had was much better, the prices charged here and not value for money for the quality of food served. Eg the appetizer spaghetti dish, was so well done when i had it at Purvis outlet, while it is SO DISAPPOINTING to pay $15 for something way less than purvis street standard. The confit duck main was dry, and easily one of the poorest i have had. The salmon dish was ok. alot more negatives in this dining experience than positives.
3
The whole experience is nice, but it can still be improved. The portion of the half lobster dish was a bit too small and for the cheese plate we weren't informed the order of cheeses to start with.
4
The restaurant has great ambiance for couples or friends alike, with a mix of small and large tables. Food is of good quality and made well. All these made all the better with their 1 for 1 main course offer :)
3
Food was above average but portion was a little small. Not worth the price if not for the 1-for-1 promo.
4
Service crew were nice and polite. Although I was pretty early from my reservation time, they allowed me in. Food was not too bad for a first time try.
4
Food was good, service was friendly and always looking out for patrons. Ambience was great but the food portions were rather small.
4
Food was ok, service was good. The environment in the restaurant was nice. Seats were a little bit pack though.
5
Highly recommended!
Food was overall good!
Will recommend this to other friends and will definitely visit the restaurant again!
4
Went with cousin and son to take advantage of the 1-for-1 offer. All four mains came at the same time. Our servers accommodated our request for serving spoons for each main dish, and a bigger plate per person rather than using the small side dish given by default. Attentive service we got at a peak time: Saturday dinner. All agreed that the chicken breast in cream of mushroom was excellent.
5
Had dinner there with a group of friends.We took the promotion to have 1 for 1 Main Course and it works differently from the 1 for 1 that we used to thought it typically was..We ordered 4 dishes and they will charge the most 2 expensive dishes.. We had the foie gras as appetiser, Snapper, Pork Belly, Lobster and Salmon as the Main Courses with the Chocolate Pistachio Ice Cream and Chocolate Lava Cake for Dessert.Service is good, they are very attentive.Food is fresh and taste just perfect! Will visit again for sure!
3
While the appetizers did not wow us and were considered at most average in taste, the mains (like salmon, rib eye, snapper and duck confit) were delicious. Do check the menu properly when ordering as some main courses do not have carbo, and you'll have to add a side dish if you wish. The desserts were also nicely done.
4
we went there for afternoon tea.
but initially staff told me i cannot apply chope voucher on afternoon tea.
that made me sad.
luckily, they agree us to use.
food is good and price is reasonable.
4
We had grilled foie gras, lobster, sauteed forest mushroom, & pear for dessert. Everything is delicious!
4
The duck confit sure lived up to the expectations as it was a signature dish! The pear themed dessert was recommended by the server and delicious as well
5
The server was really nice and genuine about introducing us their popular dishes in their food. Really had an enjoyable meal in a comfortable envt!
4
The staff is very attentive and good service with smile. Restaurant atmosphere is cool and relaxing. Enjoy my lunch there.
5
When you have kids, buffet is usually not a good idea as youngsters have not learned the "art" of maximizing the value from a buffet. However, when you get a buy one get one free deal for buffet, particularly for french brunch at a reputed french eatery, you should not hesitate because the experience we had at Saveur Art on such occasion was just amazing. There is no need to walk around and fetch your own dish. The kitchen keeps churning out courses after courses of fabulous french staples. The diligent staff make sure that your table will not be missed as they walk their way around with trays of delicious offerings. There is such a variety that even the most picky kids will find something they like. As far as the adults go, we just wish we had skipped the breakfast. Not sure how often such deal comes around but it has been the GSS of our 12 years stay in Singapore
2
The quail we ordered was so bland that we asked for salt (we never do that in any French restaurant before) The so-called burgundy sauce is almost non-existent! The foie gras used in the starter is of poor quality and seriously lack in presentation for all the dishes. Will definitely not be back!
5
The food was excellent and it is worth the money that u are paying to dine for French food at the price they are charging. The host was very good to recommend us the food which it really make the whole dinning experience to be very pleasant. Will definitely go there and dineagain.
4
We had the afternoon tea set that came with a variety of sweet and savoury items that were rather yummy! We had 2 drinks as well (coffee or tea). The little chocolate cakes and red velvet cakes were rich and good, while the macarons were slightly too sweet though. Overall a nice experience
4
The food is affordable and taste good, thanks the main Chef at ION branch. The service team are friendly, patient and approachable. The issue I would like to point to the management/Boss of Saveur Art (ION) is please increase the team members during the peak hour. We need to wait for quite a while in order to get the attention from the waitresses for our order/drink refill etc, It's not a pleasant experience 
4
Great experience at Saveur Art. Food was prepared with great care and attention. Great service too! Will definitely recommend!
4
Food and service is good. Good atmosphere to have a talk as it was quiet during lunch. The waiter/ waitress are attentive too.
3
Saveur has good Value french food for their patrons and for that I am grateful. Better for young adults or teenagers who are on a budget. There is no ambienace, just a sterile looking place.
2
Restaurant manager lack of reasonable communication skill, only knows to repeat what she wants to say instead of answering question
5
Lovely ambience - it is usually quite crowded during peak hours when I walk by but it was not too crowded for a Saturday lunch. Lunch sets are affordably priced and well-presented to a fine dining restaurant standard. Will definitely be back.

Reservation: reserved via Chope for high tea experience and purchased a $50 voucher Arrival Experience: when reached at 3plus shocked to see the sign says closed.no hostess nor sitting staff. there was a cashier. have to approach her to tell her that i have a reservations at 3pm for 2 pax. don't feel welcome at all. she then informed that they are only serving tea experience. (i am aware since i had make a reservation, guess their business are doing so great that they have to put the closed sign, to my surprise they don't seem to bother if you have a reservation.) Staff seems to be hiding. the outlet looks busy but only 2 server working, to then realise there is a whole roll of working staff sitting at the resting room. could be on split shift.Menu: not clear enough, there is no indication that mention high tea set comes with 2 pot of tea and each entitled to 1 pot each, server did not explained. have to clarify. however there is still some miscommunication.on the menu beside the moscato it says (Add 10) and champagne (add 20). on my point of view: High tea set is inclusive of 2 pot of tea. and top up 10 for a glass of moscato or 20 for a champagne. after clarifying, server then explained that we can only choose for tea or coffee, if we want the moscato at additional of 10 dollars and you don't get the tea.we wanted 2 glasses of moscato, however server told us that we had consumed a pot of tea we can only get one moscato at additional 10 dollars. we have to initiate and ask the server how about alacarte price instead of her advising us. she told us she have to check with her manager first, upon return an additional glass is at 15 each, we are happy to have that arrangement just disappointed with her reply. (again they must be doing so well, they don't require additional revenue, or maybe their system can only key in high tea set at 32) thinking the tea will not be hot we asked to serve one pot first.( i still assume we are entitled to 2 pots of tea) the server then came with one pot and 1 tea cup. we literally went dumbfounded. server is just so not service orientated. Service: food serving time was kind of slow due to the crowd.Staff is not smiley and always avoid eye contact or rather pretend not to see you. understand that they are busy, but their presence is really minimal (busy clearing the table looking down into the table, you have to wave into their eyes) . they are hard to be found. table next to us asked for additional refill of hot water for their tea, the server showed face. thankfully due to the miscom i had with her, she refilled hot water for me mistakenly thinking that we wanted a refill when i asked for my 2nd pot of tea (i assume i am entitled to 2 pot) Food: was ok only. great variety. since this is a "polished" version of savuer. the food quality was rather disappointing. believe they outsource most of the item.overall, we will not return again, even the busiest savuer outlet at bugis area can do a better job in welcoming. even though the rest of the outlets are busy and noisy, their service is way better. though i am curious how their lunch and dinner is at this polished version savuer. thanks but no thanks. hope they improve the service standard also the presentation of their menu. the promotion with chope will not work out if they have so much restriction, no point to purchase a voucher since i could hardly utilise it, even willing to top it up
4
Brought a friend here to celebrate her birthday. As usual, ambience was lovely & service was good. However, when the fish item on the set menu was not available, waitress could not offer an alternate fish item. It was only after insisting that they check with their Chef because there was a salmon dish on the ala'carte menu that she then agreed to offer it to us. Especially since the Birthday girl herself did not eat any other form of meat. I hope Saveur Art will help ensure that when a particular meat dish is not available, it will be replaced with another similar dish of the same meat kind. Other than that, service & food was good
4
All the recommended dishes were truly yummy and well executed. Egg confit, duck confit, chicken and beef choices on the set lunch were excellent. Plus we used Chope vouchers worth $50 for $45 so there was effectively no 10% service charge. Don't think this is the reason but wait staff were unsmiling and while not rude or unpleasant, did detract slightly from what could have been an excellent experience
4
While the prices here are higher than at their other outlets, I really enjoyed the attention and service. The quality of food was also good. We particularly enjoyed the desserts. I would have preferred the duck confit with a crisp skin but the flavour was good
4
A pleasant find in the vast Singapore food scene. The setting is nicely unstuffy and the 4 course set menu a delight if you're looking for a change from Asian dining. The wine list is poor although given the pricing this is understandable. Service was disappointing with our meal very rushed and too many basic errors although the staff were pleasant and seemed to be trying hard.
5
I had lunch there and asked for the lunch menu. The best onion soup I've had for a while. The waitress was very kind and recommended the duck leg - very good in taste and texture. Dessert was fantastic.
4
2nd visit but it never fail me. Good service, delicious food and nice wine. Glad my friends enjoyed themselves and like the food too.
5
Beautifully plated food. Rich and intense flavors. Egg confit was delicious. Service was good as well.
4
They have a 3 course lunch with several selections from each course to choose from, with some premium items added surcharge.
Personally I enjoyed my dessert very much considering I'm not much of a dessert person.
5
Food was delicious and surprisingly the set menus were also available over the weekend - which was superb for value.
4
The selection of both sweet and savoury treats was adequate. It was a pity though that the mini quiche lorraine and duck rillette crostini had not been warmed up before serving. Taste-wise, the food was above average. I liked the fact that there was a wide range of premium teas and coffees to choose from. Service was not intrusive, yet attentive. We were given a quiet table with comfy seats and ample room for two. Overall, the food was good value for money. It's definitely a place worth a repeat visit
5
My wife and I went to Singapore for friend's wedding. On the last day in SG, we decided to go for a walk and found this restaurant in Far East Plaza. The price of the lunch set is not cheap but I would say value for money and the dining experience is very nice.This restaurant is a nice try for those feel boring to have Asian food in SG
4
#SaveurArt: Located at ION, #04-11, this is the "high-end" version of their popular Saveur Restaurants at Purvis Street, Far East Plaza, and The Cathay. Love the Egg Confit and the Duck Confit here! Chill, cozy ambience, decent quality food at value prices, good service... I'd say this place is perfect for a first date! They have a 3 course lunch set at $29++ and a 4 course dinner set at $59++ which I recommend. Corkage at $30.Davyd's food rating: 3.75/5 Ambience: 3.5/
5
Went on a Monday. It was not too crowded. I like the simple yet classy interior decoration. The service was acceptable although they forgot to pass me the wine list and I had to prompt them for it. Overall, the food were extremely rich in flavors. Plating could be improved, though. The wine recommended matched the food. Do give their 4 course set dinner a try. You won't be disappointed.  Their hint of moping the floor to inform customers that the restaurant was closing, was not a bit subtle though and we took the hint and left promptly. Lol. I would recommend this place for special celebrations otherwise visiting their mid range Saveur at other locations is good enough.
5
Went on a Saturday afternoon for the lunch set around 2pm.Service was attentive and warm.Ingredients used were very fresh and finely executed. Had the celeriac veloute, the duck leg confit and the pear dessert was beautiful. My favourite was definitely the dessert. At $29++, this was completely a steal Will be back
5
Great service!!. Food quality is fantastic!!. Price is a little bit pricey compare to other branches.
4
well portioned dishes. food was tasty & presented beautifully üëç service was prompt & friendly. made reservation but saw some walk in customers who didnt have to wait too long to be seated... check out the attached pictures
4
The food was great here at saveur art. But the crew need to be more proactive to ask if we have place our order for the food. We have been waiting for 5mins before one staff came forward to pass us our menu to browse.
5
The lobster etuvee was great
So was the egg confit
Could not find any fault with it except portions were a little small
3
The ambience of the restaurant is good. It's more suitable for couple, friends or business lunch or dinner. Not really suited for family with kids.
I am disappointed that the menu and food is different from the Purvis street branch.
4
Place is small, food if was warm better. Refill hot water for the tea, but water was not hot. $25 for two person. Abit exp
4
Arrived Ion just before 8pm and wanted to make sure we could get a table for 2 of us and our 2 yr old gal, so we booked through chope for a table at 8.30pm. Arrived at the restaurant at 8.10pm and was told that they will call me once the table is ready. We just shopped for about 10mins and we got the seat. The food was good and the place conducive for family dine-out. Service was very prompt as well
3
A bit disappointment with the food, none of the food really impressed and also can't order any additional dish during the high tea session. When reached there a bit early around 2.45pm, the staff wanted us to come back at 3 pm. Our food served was around 3.30 pm, the timing enjoying was a bit rush.
2
After good reviews our experience was disappointing. Our wine by the glass was barely 100 ml which we believe is standard. Our order was not taken for some time - the restaurant was not busy. Our order was taken and then the waitress remembered there was no duck. No one came to check if we wanted anything else, more wine, dessert, tea/coffee until we were told last orders.
3
Dinner was alright. We ordered the savuer pasta but was served the lobster pasta instead. Alerted the staff and they were nice enough to charge us the normal price and explain to is how the menu was changed recently. Average food, don't think I will go back again.
5
Ambiance is nice, staff have good service, food is awesome, what can we ask for more? We started with egg confit, followed by chicken and salmon as our main and ended with Pear as our dessert. All of them are delicious. Worth it!!
5
Amazing set dinner value; and every dish was sublime from start to finish. I would definitely go again!
5
Impressed with food presentation and taste. Pleasantly surprised with the ingredients used in every dish. The 4-course set meal is priced so much affordable for all with no short-changed.
5
A must-not-be-missed dishes by all pork belly lover. The belly part would just melted inside your mouth and you won't wish to open your mouth again coz it's way too awesome!
5
Great Food on the set menu, not a a huge choice but the Fois Gras and Quail were awesome.
Chocolate desert was excellent and we ordered additional roast potatoes
4
presentation of dishes is beautiful and taste is awesome.
They are reasonably priced too for their weekday daily set lunch ay S$29, good bargain
5
Strongly recommend their Firecracker Chicken Nest and 8 Treasures tea. Portion is quite a lot, so good for sharing. For the taste, personally I felt they change the flavour a bit to adjust to local eating habits. But in overall still taste quite delicious.
4
Their 4 course menu at $59 is value for money. You can also have their cheese platter for $10 extra. Overall good was good and service staff were polite.
5
My friends were late and I had to wait almost 45 minutes for them. The service staff was very kind to offer me some bread and butter while I waited. It was really a nice gesture and heart-warming. We ordered the set menu with an extra main course. The food was excellent from appetizers right to the desserts. The restaurant was simple but tastefully furnished. I rate Saveur Art 6 stars!
4
SAVEUR group has been well known for making quality French cuisine available to all. The introduction of SAVEUR Art took it up a notch to provide top tier French food with hotelier standards at a mere fraction of the price. At only $59 I got to enjoy a fantastic 4 course meal. Kudos to the team for making French food more accessible to all
5
Have excellent food and the service is good. They are also flexible and the staff are giving good advise.
5
Was a truely amazing experience. Amazing food for a great price and truely friendly staff. Wasn't expecting to have such a great night.
4
Food was impeccably cooked and presented. Freshly made and delicious. The egg confit and poached pear were exquisite and gorgeous. Service was warm and friendly. Set meals were great value for money .
4
Really pretty food served. Would be good if the price is more affordable for the masses. So far it seems like a place only for the well off. Oh well too bad for me!
4
went there for dinner. Their dinner set was really value for money. Their portion of food is kinda small. Ordered two sides, four mains and two desserts for 3 pax
5
Great place for friend gathering. Good experience, staff very helpful & friendly. Had a great time chatting with friends, was the last customers to leave even thou they are closed
4
This is not our first time dining at Saveur but is definitely our first time dining at Saveur Art. The food and ambience is awesome.
5
Nice place to have high tea or a meal with friends! I will recommend to my friends and return again. 4 Stars.

I came here for prix fixe lunch as I had an appointment nearby. A friend had recommended it for dinner but it was full when we tried to get in. For lunch, it was not crowded. They have a prix fixe menu which was excellent value. I ordered the egg confit, duck confit and chocolate dessert. The egg was raw. No matter how you want to explain it, the white was still clear and gelatinous which was very off putting. The duck confit was okay but a little over done so too crispy which also means it's not as filling - the meat shrinks! The chocolate dessert was the clear winner. Service was atrocious. It took me 30 min to get a menu. A later table was served before I was. There are 2 servers and someone who apparently can only clear the tables. So this person stands there (looking like extra staff) but was unable even to bring me bread (which they failed to serve me). The menu looks interesting but if you can't even properly cook an egg or serve me bread before I finish my main course (don't even get me started on when they brought my wine) then you need to work on your restaurant before you start charging people to eat there. These are simple issues which even a home cook can master. The restaurant is a small open concept which means you can see the mall from pretty much every table. It is however on an upper floor which receives less foot traffic. I wouldn't bring a first date here but it's Singapore mall quality
2
My frequent visit to the French restaurants in Paris ( Kitchen Gallery or Epi Dupen - my Favourite ones ) makes my expectation high , may be . The visit to the Saveur Art at Ion left me wondering whether can any one do a proper French food on multiple locations ! Saveur claims to have 4 location in Singapore - the ravioli was sent back as it was unpalatable, the chicken with mushroom sauce was insipid and so my dinner was bad !! The poached pears as desert was also apology for a desert 
4
Celebrated my wife's birthday at Saveur Art.
Our first time dining at Saveur Art.
Staff is friendly, well-mannered and pleasant.
Food is very unique and nice. However, price is on the high side.
Embiance is quiet, peaceful and comfortable.
Overall experience is excellent.
5
The restaurant is beautiful & comfortable. F&B is not bad, looks presentable. I've had better.. @similar $. Excellent service saves the day! All service staff are friendly, attentive & provided high quality service. ThkQ ladies for making my daughter's & my day!
4
Overall a pleasant experience. Albeit the fairly steep price in comparison with the quality of its dining experience.
4
The food is good, especially foe Gais, lobster. The staff's recommendation is commendable. However, do not order beef. Food is slightly expensive but the quality of food makes it worth. Online reservation is convenient and accurate. Good for quiet chat.
4
Really great food and service is quick! Easily one of my fave restaurants to dine in! Would go again!
3
I chose to dine at saveur art because of a couple of good reviews I've came acrossed online. Scrolling through their menu and stumbled upon their dinner menu, to me I felt that the set sounded really reasonable thus that's probably one of the reasons why I chose saveur art. Sadly, it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Food was room temperature, the plate was hotter. The timing of each course was rather awkward and not well planned. Service was average, the younger staffs there were really friendly though. Ironic thing is those staffs had smiles on their faces and the managers didn't. Quite a turn off. Overall, I wouldn't necessarily see myself visiting again anytime soon. But I'd say it's worth a try.
5
This is probably my 4th time back at Saveur Art - I'm absolutely delighted with the food & service here. I almost always make it a point to order these 3 things when I'm there: the chorizo cold pasta appetizer, the angus bavette main, and the poached pear dessert. The food is pretty much heavenly, and service is always good. I'm not even a fan of mashed potato, but the mash that comes with my beef is so delicious I always finish it up! Definitely will be coming back many more times
2
I chanced upon the promotion via Facebook and finally decided to give it a try since it was at an introductory offer for the high tea set at $19++ for two. There were barely any customers in the restaurant when my friend and I entered although a few more customers started strolling in thereafter. We were seated at a quiet corner which was extremely fine. Then, the waitress put the high tea menu on our table, without further explanation and left. Since it was a set, there was basically nothing to choose from except from our choice of drinks. No initiative on the restaurant side was given to explain further about the high tea and left us hanging there. I asked if there were other selection of coffees although they only stated espresso, cappuccino and another which I couldn't remember. The waitress didn't know how to reply me, so she went to ask and got back to me saying, you can order either hot or iced. My question was do you have alternatives like latte. My friend and I settled for cappuccino for the start. She then asked how is the tea served, is it in a pot, and I added on if its refillable, the waitress said its by pot and they can refill hot water for us. Honestly, I assumed drinks are refillable. After my meal I decided to order the tea to complete my meal. I really thought it was inclusive in the high tea set since it was stated in the menu. It was another waiter serving us then, and she knows we are having the high tea set, being polite she could have alert us that the tea would be additional order. Honestly I wouldn't have taken it if it's chargeable. When I asked for the bill, I was really shocked when the pot of tea was charged, so I started questioning, the waitress asked me who is the one who served me so she can check with her but I couldn't remember who cause I don't see her around at that moment. From the side of my eye i can see this guy noticing the situation (should be the manager) but he don't even approach our table to handle the situation. Ultimately I paid for it since I don't really want to make a huge fuss over $5++ although I felt really unfair. A waiver for service recovery (a mere $5++) or something would have been nice, even a simple sorry would have made the situation ok to conclude that it was a confusion on both sides.I might sound abit nonsensical but such a minor case wouldn't have happened if the staffs were more proactive. I still hate how the staff is the least apologetic and understanding.

Go for the set menu if you want to experience the restaurant's capability at its best price. My friend and I opted for the famous and must-try Saveur's pasta for appetizer and crispy duck leg confit for the main course. To be honest, I always feel that the star is the dessert. Both poached pear and tropical were really delectable and visually appealing
4
The high tea set was extremely value at $19/++ for 2 pax. The cakes/desserts were very good, but the sandwiches were dismal at best - hard, dry & stale (but high tea for me & my wife is more about the desserts, so Saveur Art gets a high rating for food). However, the ambiance & environment are very unsuitable for high tea. We intended to stay for the full 2.5 hours but quickly finished our food in 30 minutes & left. The tables were placed exceedingly close to each other (I can understand that space at Ion is a premium, but just highlighting the negative experience due to trying to cramp as many tables & chairs into a small space as possible), & we were so close to our neighbors that we can clearly hear their conversations & even whispers. If you can get the high tea set at $19/++ for 2 pax, it is worth to go & try the desserts, but don't go with the false assumption that it will be a relaxing high tea

Paid 19++ for a hi tea set for two. Pretty worth it, the spread was simple and good. The teasury was pretty but they took a little long to serve the tea.
2
Worth the money but will not go again. It is consider very cheap for tea set but service sucks! Waited half an hour for the refill of tea. When tea arrived, not hot at all. Service staffs not attentive at all!
4
Good and interesting almost fine dining food and good customer service. Nice atmosphere. Easy booking online.
5
Service is great. Food very good for the price range. The tables are a little too close for comfort though. Overall a great experience!
5
The venue is great as i wanted a corner seat that is not too noisy, the service members took my request and gave me a really nice corner. Food was excellent and really impressed my friends. The overall experience is a joy. Will recommend this as a great venue for dinner with friends n love one
5
This place is very affordable for decent food. Champagnes + 2 set meals only cost about SGD 100. Food range was so-so but the food was good. My seafood dish was a pop-art colourful delight. I am always able to walk in and get a seat. All in all - a good fine.

First time trying this branch of Saveur. Heard about great food experience at Far East, thus was expecting something equivalent in terms of quality. Service was mediocre as the waitress was rude and could not even remember the number of cups of water we asked for, when there were only 4 persons. Food was so-so: the beef was too tough (requested for medium) and left the few of us with sore jaws. pork belly was tender but the sauce was abit too sour, probably personal preference, didn't go very well with the pork.

Went with other gal pals for a dinner here, after much searching for a pocket-friendly yet enjoyable evening. I picked the 4-course set at $59, my friends each had a starter and main, followed by two sides, two bottles corked at $30 each, and a cheese board to wrap up our meal. The total came up to $90 for what seemed like a much more indulgent meal and experience. The food was presented very aesthetically (we spammed our Instagram accounts) and the staff were attentive to our requests whilst being friendly. I would love to return to try the other options
4
On a recent visit for dinner, two of our party had the 4 course set menu and were delighted with all their dishes, and the third had the foie gras starter and duck confit main course, which were also very good. Food is presented beautifully, and each plate looked lovely when served. What jarred on me was how close the tables were together, and the whole atmosphere and look of the restaurant seemed a little sterile. The food, presentation and cutlery is almost fine dining, but the seating arrangements, including the actual tables and chairs themselves, felt more cheap eatery in style - with the service being pleasant and somewhere in between! Enjoyed the evening and the food WAS good, but probably won't return..

We made a rezzie on CHOPE for dinner at 5 pm. When we got there they sat us down t the table and then after 20 min after visiting with my friend we wanted to order dinner."oh we do not start dinner until 6 pm."SAVEUR ART's website states that they are open throughout the day and NO WHERE does it say that dinner starts at 6 pm.Why did CHOPE accept a razz for 5 pm for dinner when the restaurant does not start serving until 6 pm
5
Waiter was really nice. Ordered cheese platter and he explained to us the type of cheese served and the taste.
4
4 course set dinner priced at 58++ not very feeling but rather gelard after. great exposure. dessert is very special.
3
It was a bad experience. Although the place look nice, the taste of desserts was average. We had seats near corner. the stuffs of the restaurants just resting at the table beside, having outside food and playing their phones.
5
Food was excellent for its price. Staff were friendly and introduced the promo of the day clearly. Service was good as food came together for my friend and I.
4
Food was excellent! Table too close to next table. Requested a cosy table on Chope reservation but the restaurant said it was not shown on the booking
3
The waiters are not very friendly or welcoming. The food was quite nice, especially the egg confit and the pork belly.
5
I love this Saveur art in Ion plaza. We have ordered the steak & foie gras . also we tried Saveur in far east plaza. Great :)
2
Disappointed with Saveur Art as we expected it to be better than Saveur @ purvis street. However, we feel that Saveur @ purvis street is so much better than Saveur Art in terms of food, service and value.
5
As always Saveur Art continued to impress with the 4 course set dinner!My all time favourite egg confit followed by the scrumptious crab ravioli (although a bit warmer would be nicer). The main course was lobster etuvee and finished with delightful chocolate and pistachio ICE cream! Just perfect!Support local restaurants - go to Saveur Art or any of their branches!Pictures in my instagram/vernonsze

Our first time visiting a French style bistro here. Was recommended by other friends and the food / service didn't disappoint us. Traditional bistro type food was served with a friendly smile and the taste rocketed us back to Paris! It's that good! Duck leg confit was among the very best I've had, without the airfare! Definitely will return.
3
The staff service was good but the food quality wasn't. The duck confit was very salty. Overall is value for money but just that food quality needs to improve.
4
Chope is very easy to use, gives update and reminders. No need to stress and no worries on reservation.
5
Saveur Art was really a great place to have dinner at. Especially with the Ambience and also the reasonable price. Definitely worth visiting.
5
Went with my family on Wednesday, 23rd September. The food was amazing!! We had all the appetizers which is definitely to die for. I had lobster which I loved too. Don't miss out on the Egg Confit and Chocolate & Pistachio when you're there.
3
went for their first experimental (promotional) brunch. the menu was wide with a lot of choices. there was an additional 5 kinds of cheese and 4 types of cold cuts with some bread. the initial wave of food that they leave on your table is abit overwhelming. at any one time, we had at least 8 different types of food on our table (the table is small mind you), and though the food was flavorful, I was disappointed that the supposed hot items came out luke warm. you have to give them credit for the quantity that they are able to churn out for a 75% full restaurant. they kept their word of butler passing the supposed hot items. I would really like to commend one of the wait staff. I'm sorry I didn't get her name but she was a wait staff from the Philippines. she was efficient, friendly and super awesome. I give her 3 thumbs up. introductory prices were at 79$++ for 2 Pax. which came up to about 93$ for the both of us. this price did not include coffee or tea which I feel is definitely an essential for any brunch buffets. the restaurant might want to consider including this in the price. honestly, with how they overwhelm you with food, you don't end up eating much anyways. probably just a variety. worth a try. but could be better.
4
My friends and I shared pumpkin soup, egg confit, roast chicken, duck confit, steak (medium doneness), lobster, poached pear and cheese platter. Every dish was served promptly and tasted marvellous. It would have been even better if the pumpkin soup was more savoury instead of being overly sweet.
2
Too bad they were out of duck confit. Had the pork belly and egg confit. Egg confit was done well though a bit to generous with the salt. Pork belly is too fatty to my liking. Expected better from the chef. One particular female staff has gold is her mouth, she could have asked before wanting to remove a plate. Instead her arm shot between my daughter and me half way through our conversation. We have to stop her.

Visited Saveur Art for their high tea set on a Saturday afternoon. The place was not crowded and the ambience was great, good place to chill and relax on a lazy afternoon alone or with friends. I ordered the Art Tea Experience and was pretty disappointed by the quality of the savoury items. The desserts are slightly better. The bread used for the sandwiches was hard and the panna cotta was not smooth. I've visited Concetto @ The Cathay (another outlet under Saveur Group) and the quality was so much better. Perhaps their lunch and dinner was better, just that they don't specialise in High Tea sets

On the top floor of Ion, this is a bit of a surprise.I was here for dinner.A short but well thought out menu. I had the foie gras, perfectly accompanied with berries, fruit and toasted brioche, followed by the pork belly. The pork belly doesn't come with crackling, instead, the juicy pieces of pork sit on top of a bed of diced provencal vegetables and a shallow pond of delicious broth. Very tasty.Each bite of my side order of grilled seasonal vegetables had a beautiful smokey aroma and was tender yet crunchy to the bite.All that plus two glasses of wine. SGD$90. That's pretty good for Singapore (the wine was $14/glass).Service was delivered by knowledgeable and attentive staff.My only comment is that it was a bit too efficient, making it feel more like a quick service restaurant. But you may not mind the absence of ceremony if you have shopping to get on with.Apparently they have a good value set lunch menu as well
4
Was here for a friend's bday party. Birthday boy requested for it. Though not much option on the menu but the helpful and knowledgeable serving staff makes up for it. Excellent "explosion of taste buds" desserts and the dishes are a work of art.Note: This is a non-halal restaurant.Ordered: Mackerel ala plancha, which was basically grilled mackerel and vegetables. But the mackerel was done nicely
4
The good is not over complicated. Simple but well executed. Staff are friendly and flexible. Cheese platter is excellent
3
I wasn't expecting much from a cafe at ION but was pleasantly surprised. I liked the steak with mash - get it medium rare. Egg Confit was also a good appetizer. Wines are decently priced but not amazing quality.
4
An interesting place to wine and dine. The service here is 1st class and the service staff will take time to explain to you each dish and even make recommendations. A place not to be missed if you are a big fan of french food.
4
Both of their lunch sets have substantial portions. The $27 set offers a noodles entree, a chicken breasts main course & 1 dessert from the a-la-carte menu, while the $37 set offers a few selections of main course. This is a good place for business lunch as well as get together with friends. All the choices are delicious
5
Located at 4th floor of Ion Orchard, quite easy to get a place even when other restaurants are full.Food is beautifully plated and the taste is sophisticated, good generous portion of food. Simple French wine list matching well with the food.Run by a few young passionate Singaporeans, enjoyed the service and the ambience of nice art display on the wall (The arts are for sell).Overall, should totally give it a try if you haven't. Spent $105 for 2 big appetisers, 2 beautiful tasting main course and 2 glasses of wine! Great value for money

My wife, daughter, and I had a very nice lunch here while shopping last weekend. Not a 5-star but it was not meant to be. It was quiet and relaxing way to take a break from the madness of shopping with the ladies of my life. Thanks for the great food and break from shopping

We are fans of the Saveur at Purvis street. This ain't fine dining, but a more upmarket version of the original. Prices are higher, but the portions are bigger, and the dishes more innovative and sophisticated. The clientele also reflects the ION/Orchard Road neighbourhood, so no heartland folks wearing singlets or socks with flip-flops.Service is friendly, especially the head waiter who is very good and flexible. As affordable as the nearby Bistro du Vin. At the latter, the food is more traditional (and authentic), service is less good, but it's a stand-alone (vs. being in a mall) and has a better wine list (being part of Les Amis group)

Saveur Art is possibly the most affordable French fine dining restaurant here in Singapore. But is their food good? Let's see...I am a huge fan of their affordable French restaurant - Saveur - located at Purvis Street (I avoid their other branch at Far East Plaza as the service and food there is sub-par). The food and service at the Purvis Street branch is way, way better. Needless to add, when I found out that Saveur has set up a new fine dining restaurant at ION Orchard mall, I made a beeline for the place.The service at Saveur Art is impressive. The male servers were smartly dressed in black suits (nice!) and were extra attentive to all the diners. The female servers unfortunately were not as ‚Äúon the ball‚Äù as the male servers. I could tell the female servers were pretty inexperienced. Still, the lot here are way better than those at Saveur at Far East Plaza. We took the 4-course set menu priced at an affordable S$52++ per pax.This is what we experienced:- The Amuse Bouche was delish.- Egg Confit and Truffle. Our Appetiser and first course. It consists of Truffled Potato Mousseline, Roasted Macadamia Nuts, Brown Butter. If you wish to add a few slices of Truffles, it will cost you an additional S$15. Rating: 4.7/5.- Slow-Cooked Cod in Olive with Fried Baby Squids, Legume Bohemian, Artichokes and Paprika Foam. The fish was perfectly cooked but the squid was too tough/overcooked and very difficult to chew and swallow! Rating: 3.5/5.- Asian-Spiced Braised Short Ribs with Jalapeno and Rosemary Crumbs, Apples and Organic Baby Carrots. I was told that the meat was tender and delish. Rating: 4.5/5.- Roasted French Pigeon with Frogola Sarda, Beetroot, Pickled Morel Mushrooms and Liver Vinaigrette. Sadly, this is not one of the best pigeon dishes that I‚Äôve tasted. The pigeon was tough and dry. We had to send the dish back to the kitchen as it was under-cooked and oozing with blood. Still, the meat was too tough and not tender at all. I would recommend not ordering this dish at all if you dine here. Rating: 1/5. Fail.- Chocolate and Pistachio Guanaja Fondant with Tanariva Mousse, Ivory Espuna, Araguani Chips and Pistachio Ice Cream. Rating: 4/5And we ordered Coffee to cap off the meal. I had Cappuccino - priced at S$5++ per cup.I had expected more from this restauant. The food here just didn't "wow" me or my friends. I think I still prefer the food at Saveur (at Purvis Street)

On a flight from Singapore to Seoul on a Monday, I picked up a copy of The Straits Times.There was a long article about two young chefs who started out in hawker stalls, then had a vision to harness their passion to bring simple but cook French cooking to ordinary Singaporeans.I returned to Singapore a few days later and The New Majestic Hotel organised a booking.The result is Saveur Art, recently opened on level 4 of the large labyrinth that is the ION Shopping Centre off Orchard Rd in Singapore.The result is really very impressive and a credit to the unlikely team of boyhood friends with different temperaments.The front of house service was very polished, friendly yet understated and professional.The cooking was light and each dish was seasoned well and cooked beautifully.My friend and I shared two dishes and enjoyed a separate main.My entr√©e of crab and avocado was wonderfully light with the sweetness of the crab complimented by the smooth avocado spiced with a hint of chilli.My main, mackerel with veggies was just delicious, rich, oily fish with the crunch and texture of the garden in your mouth.The dessert was a shared plate of ice creams, quite yummy!Cannot recommend highly enough - a must see restaurant in an already vibrant Singapore cooking scene
