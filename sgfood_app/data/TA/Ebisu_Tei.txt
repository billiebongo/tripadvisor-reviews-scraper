We were the only table for dinner on a Saturday night. There's only one person making the food and one person serving. I applaud their earnestness but I wouldn't return nor recommend anyone going there. I'm no connoisseur of Japanese food but I think it's nowhere near half of what a Japanese restaurant should be serving. The tuna belly roll had very little tuna, the california roll (ordered out of curiousity) was chock-full of rice. The bowl of soba in hot broth was bland to put it lightly although the tempura was decent. Also ordered shisamo, tako wasabi and daikon salad which were all lacklustre. What was interesting though was that they seem to be making plum wine specifically for customers. I thought that was pretty neat
