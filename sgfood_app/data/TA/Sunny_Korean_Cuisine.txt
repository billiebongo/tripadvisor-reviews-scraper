Whenever having school and end late, will end up dining here as it opens till late at night for dinner~ great korean food at affordable price~ the place is usually filled with the oily smell but generally bearable.

this place serves decent korean food at affordable prices, evidenced by its long queues and crowded establishment where diners have to wait for available seats if eating in. favs would be the kimchi ramen noodles, paired with some dumplings.
