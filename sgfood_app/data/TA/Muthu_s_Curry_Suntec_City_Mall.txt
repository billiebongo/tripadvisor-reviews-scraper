We had a business lunch in this Indian restaurant located in Suntec City.
We all took chicken Tikka Massala, tasty and quickly served. When UOB client you get a 10% discount on the bill (>30 SGD)
3
Quick business lunch. We had mainly chicken in different styles with rice. Good quality and light. I miss this kind of offer in Italy
3
Our first visit here and was not disappointed with the food. Ordered Butter Chicken, which was very rich and yummy, and Fish Head Curry, which was slightly fishy and tad spicy. Food tasted good but was very thirsty the whole night after that
4
Great for family meal. Curry bowl platter is good to share for 3-4 with additional portion of rice. Recommend the chicken karaage for sides.

When my wife and I visited Singapore two weeks ago we were determined to try a fish head curry.Staying at the Conrad Centennial we quickly established that the nearby Muthu’s Suntec City was the place to go.Suffice to say we were not disappointed. Excellent meal, with prompt and courteous service. Will definitely return when next in Singapore (and given the literally thousands of food outlets in Singapore that’s saying something)
5
We are regulars at the main restaurant along Race Course Road but the outlet can be very noisy and crowded, and parking is a nightmare!The Suntec branch in contrast is quiet and more dignified, catering mostly to family groups. Taste and pricing is the same at both outlets, but the advantage here is the ample parking (per entry after 5pm).Service here is fast and efficient and the staff are as friendly and helpful as at Race Course. We loved the self-service water and pappadum counter which kept us well entertained!Our order: Signature Fish Head Curry ($22 for small, $27 for medium), Butter Chicken ($13), Fish Cutlet ($2.50) Naan ($3 plain $4 garlic), Rice ($3 plain $4 biryani). Sufficient for our family of four and extremely delicious
5
This restaurant is basically Indian food both veg and non - veg. Sufficient vareities and yummy food. Staff are friendly and professional. The orders are placed via iPad which is available in every table. It's always crowded. Prices are reasonable. Water and papad is self service. Papads are complimentary. Keep up the good work!!

Had eaten at Muthu's Curry in Suntec City a few years ago. It was high time to give it another go. This time, tried a straightforward vegetarian dinner setup with Black Daal, Aaloo Mutter, and Biryani Rice (which included two vegetable dishes). Good on all points with just enough spice to add a spark to the evening. Also, must add a star for service, as all the waitstaff were smiling and attentive. This absolutely hit the spot. Cheers, Muthu's

The problem with big shopping malls is that you need a quick bite and a brief moment to recoup at a decent price. All these aspects are satisfied by this restaurant in Suntec city. There is a popular choice of Indian food here. More importantly, it is delivered to your table much earlier than you expect. If you order some mocktails or soft drinks, that also comes quick. The dishes are well prepared, nothing extraordinary but well palatable. Also , there is free supply of pappadam , but the rider is that you have to go & fetch it yourself. The ambience is below average but the restaurant is clean. The pricing is a bit more than the foodcourts, but easy on the wallet specially when you are shopping at Suntec city
5
So when we were in Singapore and looking for some Indian outlets to fulfill our craving, we came across Muthus Curry Suntec plaza..Food is yummy, you can order here via Ipad provided at each table. Glass of water & Papdams are self service. Very nice staff who speak good English and Tamil. The restaurant is always in demand..we made a visit almost thrice during our fortnight stay but never found it empty. Food is very tasty, and quantity is sufficent enough. It has both vegetarian & non-vegetarian options. A must try for everyone who is missing Indian food. Kudos to the staff & their good work
4
We ordered the fish head soup, chicken chukka, and curry mutton. Their meals are great, not too spicy but still tasty.
5
The food is tasty, service is speedy and prices are reasonable. The usual dishes feature on the menu. If you enjoy Indian cuisine, try this.
1
A la carte menu at lunchtime with free flow papadom was extremely poor value. Mean portions with poor spicing served tepid. Poor rice and quality and we would have been better served using the food court.
5
Must try Fish Head Curry...if you are at Muthu's Curry..
Not only fish curry was good but you must try cheese chicken kebab..
Too good to resist..

The restaurant offers good Sound Indian food with authentic Indian taste and spices. The food is served on the dinner table by the attendants while water and salads/papad are self-service based. The style of serving the food with traditional banana leaves in the plate adds to the flavours. Must try items (Non-Veg): Chicken ChettinadButter chickenChicken TikkaDum Biryani (Chicken)Must try items (Veg): Dal Makhani/Black DaalButter PaneerGarlic Naan.The ambience and the location of the restaurant is a big plus. Try occupying the outdoor seats to enjoy the view of the Fountain of Wealth

Most Indian eateries in SE Asia tend to be Southern Indian. With the influx of people from the North of India, cuisines have changed to accommodate a wider variety. Muthu Curry caters to this in a clean, organised business lunch setting with aplomb and efficiency without sacrificing taste and flavour. Fish head curry was great, fish cakes could do with a little more texture a touch dry), biryani rice was typically southern without any fruits, palak paneer was ok without being spectacular, and most of the other curries were honest and satisfactory. There is the usual tandoori oven and rotis. For a business lunch out offers a great place to entertain without being disappointed.
1
More of a self service restaurant Attendant was not welcoming help your self to your seat , comes n leaves a tab to order food while lamely pointing out to a kiosk for water / papadum No serviette/ napkins / finger bowl upon asking was directed outside the restaurant Food was ok would definitely not recommend We ordered Chicken tikka- was okFish tikka -was ok Crispy lady finger -was ok signatures fish head curry with biryani rice ( biryani rice came with cabbage vegetable n aubergine pickle) Just about ok to taste Palak paneer ( not greasy) was decent but small portion Assorted nan basket ( they all tasted same plain ) Nothing out of the ordinary Extremely poor service actually no service Self checkout Staff does not even smile Would not visit again n do not recommend as there are umpteen option available Wonder y they have a 10.% service charge that should actually be the discount as its self service
2
1st time to this outlet. The naan is one of the best I had in Singapore. Curry fish head was disappointing as the fish isn't fresh. Perhaps is just mine. Chicken 65 is nice! Felt very thirsty after we left. I guess the msg kicks in.
3
We got into this restaurant, with the assumption that it's an upscale south indian restaurant. However, don't think the quality or the quantity of the food does justice to teh price they charge. The dining tables are placed pretty closed to each other, so on a crowded day, it would be almost like eating at a food cour
4
Came for dinner with friends. Recomend to try fish head curry, and mutton curry with bread. I feel food is good, service is good. Better to get table with nice view of Fountain of Fortune that add value to your meal. Recomendable to hv Indian curry in Singapore
3
we had our lunch here after checking out the mall, the quality of food is decent but a bit on the expensive side,
5
It's an Indian Restaurant in Singapore and here the food was excellent very tasty and yummy we had Fish Curry Rice which was superb one must visit this place it's awesome.
5
The Staff well received and My Friend recommended to have Gobi Manrichan, however since am from Hyderabad, the choice went towards to have "Hyderabad Chicken Biryani", after long stay in Singapore felt the "Indian food Spicy" touch here. Must visit to tickle your taste buds
1
There is terrible service, rude staff and you have to pay the bill before your meal is finished. I ate chicken over there and got a stomach flu.
5
Sat here mainly because everywhere else was crazily packed but so glad we did. Great Northern Indian food in a pleasant uncrowded part of the mall. Service excellent, free-flow popadums (sic) and a great mango lassi. What's not to like?
5
Went here with my colleagues for a team lunch. We settled for curry as everyone had a different preference in food. It turned out to be a good decision. Loved the curry but a little disappointed by the naans. Slightly on the pricey side due to the restaurant being in town. We were seated outside the restaurant but that turned out to be the best decision made for us as the view of the Fountain of Wealth was simply breathtaking. Even as a local myself, this is the first time I had such a fantastic view of the fountain
2
Those whom have had tasted Muthu's Curry > 10 years ago will realize that the taste is no longer as good as before.Aaloo Mutter was served nice and warm, however Curry Fish (slice) has lost the original taste and also served cold.1 fish + 1 vege + 3 plain naan > S$25, not exactly value for money
3
We ordered a small curry fish head (they were serving red snapper that day) and a plate of masala chicken and one plain naan. The dishes look ok, reasonable size serving. Taste is not as fragrant and yummy as I anticipated. I find Banana Leaf's dishes better but I guess sometimes it's a matter of taste. I can't say that the curry fish head was piping hot. Service is friendly and fast and place is clean. Pricing reasonable - around SGD50 for what we had. Location is very convenient. Toilet facilities are in the mall.
4
Ambience and location:Location of the restaurant is big plus. Only Indian restaurant in suntec.Ambience is nice specially if you are sitting next to fountain of wealth.Service:Service is very good. We were guided well while ordering food. Only thing which I didn't like was self service for water. Didn't make any sense to me.Food:Food is good in taste and adapted a bit to suite locals and tourists.Quantity is less considering the cost per dish. Desserts are average compared to main course.Must try:Fish tikka and mango lassi in starters Chicken chetinadu in main course
4
If you don't like your food looking at you (a North American thing...) don't worry, the fish head is engulfed in the delicious curry with nary an eyeball poking out. And there is plenty of meat as the "head" really includes the first third of the entire fish. The flesh is perfectly cooked and the curry is so good that you keep at it long after you are full. The dish is very large (I got the small portion!) and satisfying. Only difficulty was finding the restaurant as it is tucked out of the way in the basement level of a very large mall -- but worth the trek
1
Terrible service.
Arrogant and rude staff.
No courtesy towards patrons.
Want the bill to be paid even before the meal is finished.
In a hurry to push guests out of reataurant.
Not a place worth visiting or recommending.
4
Muthu's curry in Suntec City offers delicious food with good ambience. Seatings available facing the fountain with fantastic view. Love not only food but service too.
4
We came here for lunch. The Chicken Tikka Masala, the Tandoori chicken were amazing. The Lamb Vindaloo not as good as I expected. Quite disappointed with the service. I wish they could be friendlier. Overall I'll come back for the food.
4
I grabbed a quick dinner one night here (was staying across the street at the Conrad Centennial). It wasn't busy and the service was prompt. It's nothing fancy (if you want water you have to get it yourself), but the curry was delicious.
5
want some change in test buds try this Indian cousin. Food offered here is south/North Indian with verity.
Fish variety offers here is very nice.Good test with spices thrills you.
I love to go again here
4
Our friends from Singapore took us there- definitely try the tandoori pomfret. Also try the murgh chettinadu.
3
Went for a dinner, while walking pass this legendary curry house. Craving for biryani..ordered mutton biryani and a lime juice. Service is below average.. And biryani was disappointed. Mutton was very hard in texture. Briyani was flat, but lime juice was great.. Ambience was moderate. Spend $18++.. Nice place to have family dinner. Cozy and clean. Need improvement and new service team to improve PR.. Good luck.
4
This is one of the best when it comes to Fish Head Curry. NON-CURRY eaters, have to be careful as it's likely to give you heartburn if ur not careful. Another dish of note is the Dum Briyani. It come as a complete set with an egg and either chicken or mutton. Just had it again this evening.
3
As compared to it's flagship store at Race Course Road, this Suntec outlet is in a more convenient location as it's in a shopping mall. It has a half self-serve and half table service concept. Water and papadums are on a side table to the left of restaurant and it's unlimited self-serve. The small fish head curry was quite substantial for the two of us. Although delicious, we felt they might have used a lot of MSG which our palate is not accustomed to as we felt extremely thirsty even hours after dinner. The black pepper squids were horrid. It was salty and there's hardly any taste. I preferred the Race Course outlet but I'm uncertain if they still maintain the same standard as it's been more than 10 yrs since I last frequented it
3
We ordered a lot of dishes and we are surprised that amount of food was not as much as we expected. The prawn was $4 each and lamb was really expensive. Fish curry and lamb were great but the rest was just ok. I had better butter chicken at other Indian restaurants. The Naans were served until the same bowl together which created a bit of inconvenience for us since we ordered 3-4 different kinds and we had to flip through the stack to look for the one we ordered (not the most hygienic!)Mango lassi was good but at $7? This kind of price and amount of food is for special occasion. Not for everyday lunch.
4
The place was easy to find, the service was good , staff were friendly and the environment and food were excellent.
4
Got good reviews and went to try. It was great. The food is good, nice ambience. The view of the fountain is nice. We were a bit late but the staff accommodated our requests. Would love to go back again.
4
I would rate it as GOOD. Very fresh Indian food. A good selection on the menu. Quick and friendly service. It was very busy at lunch time, but the staff are efficient.
2
Many popular reviews brought me to this restaurant, I visited with my wife and two young kids, I tried to order simple menu I.e. Indian flat bread and biriyani rice with only one chicken curry, as I am not a great lover of meat, the guy who is taking our order forced us to order another curry by saying, this is not sufficient . I explained him that my kids don't eat meat, but he disagree with that he didn't move from there until I order another curry. I was really furious about his cheap hard selling tactics but I don't want to mess up the evening by arguing.Our order have been served later, each serving of chicken curry has a full breast, we couldn't even finish one, I always tell my kids not to waste food. But this time I land up in wasting food in front of my kids.Chicken curry was terrible, not worth paying premium.I decided to not to go back to Muthu's curry, will never
4
In Singapore, apart from the famous steamed Hainanese chicken rice, Laska, Bak Kut Teh (Herbal Pork Soup), I always want to eat the typical Indian curry. This restaurant has many branches. Choices provided are plenty, taste very good, very Indian indeed (unlike the Malaysian or Singaporean curry which are sweeter with coconut paste added in). This is very typical Indian curry, served at a reasonable price. Highly recommend to eat in this restaurant if you like Indian curry. Eventhough dishes provided are very tasty, might not be suitable for diabetics, as after a meal, blood surgar can shoot up to 21 of which normal sugar level should be at 6.
4
I had the opportunity to have a dinner yesterday in this restaurant and it was very interesting in terms of food offer and quality. The service was quick and efficient even if the restaurant was pretty full. I suggest to visit this place, clean and well arranged, to all western people not familiar with Indian food but interested to know what it is. Excellent choice!

I visited this place with 3 other colleagues during lunch time The place is next to the Food Republic in the basement of Suntec buildings. It was crowded when we reached around 1:15. We had to wait for few minutes to get the place.Three of us shared Indian breads and gravy while one of our colleague decided to try the dum biryani. The quantity of food was good. Biryani was enough for 1 person. For 3 of us who decided to share the gravies, two gravies were bit short. The staff accepted our request to replace the Kashmiri naan in the assorted bread basket with garlic naan. We also tried their rumali roti. All the breads were good. The gravies had a bit of South Indian touch to it in terms of the spices used in them. They tasted good. One of our friend tried the butter milk and it was nicely done. They have papad (papadam) which are available as self service along with regular water. The place seemed busy and at times people had to wave at staff to get their attention. For the quantity of food, the prices are slightly on the higher side. It looks natural for me to charge a bit given the fact that there are not many Indian restaurants in the vicinity. Going by the overall experience of this, I would recommend this place if you want to try some south Indian food
4
We went for an early business dinner. The food is tasty and well prepared. The south Indian food they serve may be a little too hot for some. Only thing is their signature dish the fish head curry is not what I was expecting as the 3 starters we had were great and the fish head curry is just ordinary.
4
Let me get this out of the way - I have how crazily priced Muthu's curry is. But maybe they need that price to filter out people and keep their volumes managable - cuz afterall, Muthu's curry is perhaps the name most often heard by expats when they ask friendly non-indian Taxi drivers: "where can I get great Indian food?" Possibly they have been saying the same name "Muthu's Curry" for decades now, not noticing the many fantastic new Indian eateries that have sprung up around Singapore. In any case, they kept coming, and the rates at Muthu's kept going up.But the food is good. Its not great, mind you. But its alright. "Fish Head Curry" is a staple here, as it is in many other "authentic Indian restaurants" in Singapore. I can only imagine some clever entrepreneur in the 1960's figured out a way to make some bucks out of the otherwise thrown-out fish's head. The concept stuck, and to this date expats and poor Singaporean chinese folks like eating their fish heads. I'll go with the rest of the fish where there is some meat, thank you
3
looked promising as we went in as most tables were occupied. Reasonable choice of veggie dishes so we ordered a couple along with biryani rice and peshawari naan. when the food arrived both main dishes were not overly hot, in fact they were luke warm. The biryani rice was described in the menu as rice with vegetables and nuts. It was rice and there were about 6 peas in it, and a couple of small pieces of carrots but as to the nuts, they had obviously vacated our portions. The naan was not one of the best I have ever had either. It is a shame because the food was actually tasty but considering the competition in the area they will not be getting a second chance to impress us
5
Had been for lunch. Ambiance was good. Food was very tasty and authentic.
Mysore mutton was highlight. Service was good and fast.
Bit expensive and quantity was less compared to other places.
4
The veg food was good and also non veg food was tasty. As regards quantity a little less as compared to banana leaf. and cost wise a bit on higher side. Will definitely refer and vist again.
5
We had chicken tikka masala, a lamb dish, biryani rice, vegetable kabobs and garlic naan. Food was really good, we'd definitely go back!
4
Of their three branches in Singapore, I had gone to their Suntec City outlet. Did not try the Fish head curry but their chicken biryani was quite flavorful. Understand that their veggie options are good too. Papads and water is self service.
1
indeed - heritage LOST! food sucks - service below average - price nothing to brag about...the curry fish head - my cate wont even eat it. enough said. utterly disappointed. we gave up eating after taking a few spoons of rice and with whatever we ordered
4
Popped in for a quick lunch. Great service which came with an additional extra serving of smiles (which is not common to see in restaurant staff in Singapore). Food was quick and excellent and loved the "help yourself" to the popadums. Makes a change to being given a merge few as pre-meal tasters. Good choice and value for food on the run

This restaurant is famous for its fish-head curry and fish-head curry was what we ordered , apart from some other items including chicken and biriyani . Indian preparations are not so rare in Singapore and there are couple of other eateries which have also earned fame for their fish-head curry. But Muthu's Curry in swanky Suntec City Mall is very special in its location , decor and palate-pleasing dishes. We had heard about it and dropped in for a family dinner.We were late , so our's was the last order of the day . This enabled us to get super fast service. As we were collecting complimentary pappads (appalam) from the self-service booth , the food was delivered on our table. The curry was placed in a large metal container . As we removed the cover , we found a large fish-head half immersed in spicy-looking gravy. We had specifically asked for a small fish head. We wondered if this was small , how the large and mediums must be. I must say that the sight of severed head of a fish staring straight at you with dead eyes is a grotesque sight which can put off some sensitive people. But non-vegetarian food presupposes certain amount of insensitivity. Fish head curry of Muthu's is a good model to assess your sensitivity.But the test of the recipe is not in its sight but in its taste. We were not disappointed. The spicy South Indian taste pleased us. Biryani was just as it should be. Chicken was also well prepared. There were two vegetarian light dishes which were complimentary . We had a hearty meal and left the place just as it was closing down. The friendly staff wished us good night as we conveyed our appreciation. The restaurant is located on one side of the famous Fountain of Wealth , at the lower layer. One can have a good view of the lower circle of the fountain during specific hours. This may add to the charm of the restaurant. Many people will swear that fish- head curry can be best relished without cutleries .That is the typical Indian way of eating. Worth trying
4
This unpretentious fish head curry restaurant replicated it trade well in CBD now. As usual, we were fast attended to after we were seated - took the order, serve the vegetable sides, drinks and food came. All completed within 10 minutes. However, the service stopped there. From there on, we needed to wave and shout to get attention from the busy servicing staff. The food here was slightly tone down compared to that at race course road but still good. It served my curry craving well in quick time
4
The fish head curry was fantastic. However, the rest we ordered was average. I also expected refined and balanced use of spices. There was a slight bitterness to the squid i ordered. Biryani rice was disappointing. It's a neat hotel but feels a bit touristy. I hear the original one in Little India is better but I have not had a chance to visit. Overall good to visit once and try the fish head curry

Muthus's motto of "serving passionately ..." has flushed into the toilet when I happily & excitedly brought my family to dine for dinner today at 6pm in Suntec. My last visit was when i won the Father's Day contest & was invited to Buffalo Road. We were treated like maharajas & maharanis over there. Maybe the bosses & senior people are there to uphold the standards but not here, it was utterly appaling & disgusting. A big regret, I would have gone to patronise Samy's Curry instead. We were here at 5.30pm & the 3 Indian staff were sleeping on the sofa in the dark premise while all the neighboring restaurants around the Fountain circle were lit brightly & we could see briefing sessions whereby waiting staff were hyped-up by managers, all ready to serve incoming customers at 6pm except for Muthu's sleeping staff. I brought along my mum who's in her 77 years old yet the staff just ignored the need of enthusiastic customers into the restaurant to sit & wait. They just couldnt care less. Frankly, I could just walked off & never support Muthu's ever again. Finally, i requested whether can we take a seat & pre order the dishes before opening at 6pm. We ordered 2 starters, Fish Head Curry & cold drinks. And we told staff Aziz to only serve the Curry when my wife comes in at 6.15pm but do serve the 2 Starters first. To our horror, the curry arrived first & the starters only turned up 15 minutes later. I cant believe the big size supervisor didnt know what starters from main course. The fried ladies fingers arrived but they were not crispy but limpy & soft. My daughter wanted this was because in Buffalo Rd, she loved it so much. The fish cutlets were bland & hardly we bit into fish at all as the flour was in abundance. Of all the dishes that had to be disapponting, it was Muthu's so-called signature & iconic dish, the fish head curry. When the supervisor lifted up the lid, there was no vege in sight!!! No tomato, no ladies finger, no egg plant but one small miserable piece of pineapple. Visually, this was ugly & unappetising. As i stirred the broth, then emerged 2 miserable ocras & when i bit on them, they were hard, fibrous & definitely old lady fingers. Oh boy, i wish the founder & owner & his wife, could see such passionate quality is served to customers. I also wonder whether this is how they eat ladies fingers in their family meals, old hardy fibrous ones. Could the executives kindly care to explain such deplorable standards? Service was absolutely deplorable until Mr Chan appeared. He turned our nightmare into a more palatable dinning experience. Chan was cheerful, smiling & attentive to our dining needs. Instantly, he rushed into the kitchen & brought out a small bowl of ladies fingers, younger ones this time round. He took initiatives to top up our side dishes. My wife walked in later & nobody served her the side dishes at all until i called for Chan. Unbelievable, Muthu's standard sank into the abyss within the first few minutes. Would i return? Would i recommend someone else? Would i bring my family back again? NO WAY, Muthu's becoming deplorable. I would definitely switch my support to Samy's
5
Living in London I'm very used to good Indian food. This restaurant was excellent and I was very well looked after by Ragu. I will definitely go again next time I'm here.
5
Once again best curry. Butter chicken mutton vindaloo Reji always helpful and a great host. Can't wait to return
4
When we asked a local Indian woman - who happened to work at another Indian Restaurant in Singapore where sh'ed recommend eating good Indian Food - she referred us to Muthu's Curry. It was very good. Especially liked was the self service Papadam and beverage bar. We had their chicken Masala entree, a Garlic Chicken Kebab entree, 2 (large - you can share one- they underestimated the size to us) green salads, 1 Aaloo Mutter Entree and 2 Biryani Rice sides for $65 Singapore Dollars including extra tip. The food was pretty spicy even for Indian food, but good overall. There are three Muthu's Curry Restaurants in Singapore to choose from
4
This place is known for Fish Head Curry which is really not to be missed. The food was really authentic, spicy and delicious. But beware platters (fried items) are more oily and not up to the standards. If you are looking for South Indian food, then this is the best place to dine-in
5
We ate here on a number of occasions during a recent stay in Singapore. The food was absolutely delicious with something to suit every taste. The butter chicken and Malabar fish curry are highly recommended. The service was excellent, very friendly and attentive waiters and all the food is freshly prepared in view of the diners. Very reasonable prices make this a great place to sample authentic Indian foo

Went for a lunch yesterday at the Suntec branch. The place looked like a battlefield. Probably it was because we reached soon after lunch hours (around 2:30pm) but all the plates that people ate and the leftovers were lying on the tables- none of them had been cleaned up. It was disgusting to say the least. Second, we were 2 persons and ordered plain rice and biryani rice which comes with 2 veggies. We were told we cannot order like that and should order a main course too. I believe when you go to a restaurant, that too off-peak hours you can order whatever you like, even if just a cup of tea. Well, all in all the experience at this branch was terrible even though I really like their other branches especially at Dempsey Hill
4
We have visited this restaurant couple of times and I thought I should review this place. Nestled in the basement of Suntec city, it overlooks the fountain of wealth which gave us a spectacular view. The interiors are nicely done with an authentic chettinad feel. There are options of inside and outside seating (outside gives a better view especially at night when the fountain is beautifully lit).Now let me come to the food part of it. We didn’t have to wait long and were seated immediately. For starters, we had the crispy okra and chicken 65. For the main course, we had Chicken Chettinad, chicken Vindaloo, Rice, Roomali roti, Garlic naan and yogurt. For dessert we had Gulab jamun and Kulfi. The roti’s were cooked to perfection and was soft especially the Roomali roti. The dishes had the right and good blend of spices, very authentic, especially the chicken curry. Excellent recommendations by the owner of the restaurant, especially the chicken dishes. I am told that the desserts are homemade and tasted very much like that. Since we are not seafood fans we couldn’t try their signature fish head curry which as per other reviews are to die for. If you want the full Indian experience make sure you try their authentic Indian tea with cinnamon rolls for flavour.The food here was fantastic, affordable pricing, very friendly staff and has exceeded my expectations and I have always walked out with satisfaction
4
Indian food is a high priority when in Singapore and Muthu's is always on the list. The food is excellent quality, especially the fish head, according to my husband, a must have when eating here. The service is good and had some other alternative menu items for the kids
5
This is one of the restaurant that we frequented for dinner. We especially like their plain naan ($3 each), superb butter chicken ($12) and dum biryani chicken ($11). Imagine that my kids can eat the whole naan with only the sauce from the butter chicken alone... The lime juice ($3.50) is very good but quite expensive! If you have Citibank or UOB credit cards, you can squeeze more value out through a 10% discount for your meal but only on weekday and if you spend more than $30. Great choice if you want delicious Indian food
1
We were looking forward to a return visit here since our last visit 10 months ago but were really disappointed. The food was luke-warm to cold, very small portions and strangely spiced. It feels like they use a one pot method that makes - for example - dishes like butter chicken seem unusually over spiced. The welcome was a grunt. I also don't like seeing service added but an open credit card slip in order to double dip service.  My wife was upset because she was so looking forward to this and was so disappointed
