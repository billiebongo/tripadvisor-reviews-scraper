We tried both the Black and white carrot cake. Everyone was ordering by pointing at the food selection. It was all cooked fresh and tasted amazing. Take the time to make a visit and try both types - different but loved both!

This stall came highly recommended as one of the best in Singapore. We endured a long queue and wait for a portion of "Ying Yang". It was half portion of radish cake fried with beaten egg and half portion of the same radish cake fried with sweet soy sauce. The semi-crispy egg covered chopped pieces of radish cake. It was not salty but flavored by the fried bits of Chinese dried radish. You could taste each ingredient. The dark sauce version was sweet with generous sprinkle of chopped spring onions. However we did not appreciate the soft and mushy texture of the radish cake

If you invite an Angmo (like myself) to eat Carrot Cake in Singapore, he might think of the ones you get in the Coffee Shop Chains.. Forget about that type of Carrot Cake...go to stall 26 in Zion Riverside Food Centre, Lau Goh and be amazed!The couple might be deaf, but they have pictures of their variations of carrot cake you can point at. Yes even the chilli is pictured there.Choice between white and black, so the best is to go for the combination! You will be surprised if this is your first "Singapore carrot cake", amazed if this is your first Lau Goh version and thrilled if you are a returning customer! Just go, order, eat and be in awe!! Im sure you will become a returning customer too

Have been visiting this stall for going 4 years now, it is by far the best carrot cake in Singapore. If you have visited hawker stalls before you will know what to expect. Right amount of spice, alot of value for money and there is usually a line. *pro tip* both the people that work in the stall are hearing impaired, you need to point to what you want from the menu that is on the counter

I ordered the Yin Yang (Black and White) Carrot Cake. It was so good that I succumbed and ordered a second plate after walloping the first plate!Eggs are fried to perfection with a crisp on each bite. The authentic hand made carrot cake was smashed to smaller pieces so that they can be fried more crispy.Must definitely order this if you visit Zion Road Food Centre
