Just a random stumble into a restaurant but what a meal! I am a curry, or anything spicy, fan and that chicken was outstanding. SGD$17 very affordable.
Friendly service, chilly aircon all was great.
5
The A/C in the restaurant was a bit too cold for us so we sat outside. That aside, the service was fast and courteous and the food was excellent. Best city I‚Äôve had outside of India.

Dined here with with my family and friends on a Saturday for lunch. Ordered chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, lemon juice and masala tea and coffee. Chicken tikka masala was pretty good. It was subtly spiced and creamy. Naan was aromatic and fluffy. Masala tea was pretty decent too. Service was pretty slow though.

Little India is becoming a favourite destination for me now in Singapore, but as always better to leave the locals to choose the best of many options. On this occasion, my colleague Raj suggested Mustard which is a Punjabi and Bengali specialist. The Murraya Chicken was excellent with boneless tender chicken with a spicy marinade and a great chilli kick. The ‚Äúhandkerchief‚Äù Roti was great too with the accompanying Mustard Gravy. Washed down with a super cold Kingfisher. The service was efficient and friendly.

I wasn't a big fan of Indian restaurants in Singapore (of which there are many) until I ate here. The food is really fantastic. The various blends of spices they use are aromatic, exotic and deeply pleasurable for the senses rather than simply hot and spicy. The meats are tender and come from good cuts. Recommend reservations as this place is typically full. The service was attentive even though they had several large tables of business people. Mango lassie, lamb dishes, shrimp and the chicken tikka all were excellent. another plus is that it is very clean. Only drawback for me is that it was very loud
5
We went here for dinner on our last night in Singapore. The Indian spices and flavours greeted you as you walked in. The restaurant was very clean and the staff were very helpful when choosing dishes. I would recommend this restaurant for great night of good food. We went on Sunday night when Little India is quite busy. The restaurant had a steady stream of tourists and locals
4
The owner told me that this is likely the only restaurant in the entire south east Asia that serves Bengal food. With much skepticism, I put the first taste of the coconut curry infused prawns and I'm immediately a convert. This is by far one of the best meals I have in Singapore, any cuisine included
4
Where in the world would you ever get a marriage of the finest, authentic Punjabi cuisine with real, authentic Bengali. Nowhere else in the world but Singapore. Mustard specializes in serving both cuisines and you cannot go wrong- definitely order the Kosha mangaho (mutton cooked in its own juices) and the fish with sarse bata (ground mustard) and get the sarsoon ka saag (mustard seed spinach) and the tadka daal. You will not regret coming to this place. Service is phenomenal and the place gets packed with tourists and locals so be sure to book
4
Ok so apart from the obvious profiteering by charging $25 corkage for one bottle of wine, I have to say this place is quite a gem. Obviously we opted to drink their pretty average offering served meagrely in quantities that would make your most parsimonious aunt blush.We had the fish Tika, succulent and spicy. The spicy Dahl finished with cream, and the prawn masala served in a whole coconut were divine. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had a curry in a restaurant, where you could savour all the complex spices that went into the finished product.The naan we ordered appeared to have been heated up in the microwave, it definitely wasn‚Äôt fresh, it was hard and inedible, and they quickly, and without drama, removed the charge from the bill.If this place just paid a bit more attention to detail it could be great...I am rating it four stars but it reallly deserves 3.5 for the poor bread, the mean wine serves, and the exorbitant corkage
4
I live in Little India and have eaten my fair share of curries and prata roti. This place is superior to the rest.We ordered fish tikka to begin with, which was succulent and served with a zesty coriander sauce. For main course, their signature prawn masala curry and creamy dhal were magnificent. Creamy, fresh and full of spice. I can still taste the cumin!The roti bread was a little disappointing as it was burnt and hard on the underside. Next time I would order rice rather than bread, or stick with just naan.Altogether an excellent meal and I would go here again, above all other Indian restaurants in the area. A new firm favourite
5
The place is rather small, but it has a large number of option of either Bengali or Punjabi cuisine. I was there with 4 friends and everybody was pleased with the food (taste and appearance). I got a Bengali curry and it was delicious.
5
Even after years away Mustard doesn't disappoint. Just love this restaurant. There's nothing bad to say. Food is fantastic. Service is second to none. Will come back over and over whether living here again or visiting...
5
People who know Bengali and Punjabi cuisine well, know that Mustard is definitely at the top of the game. I have been going to this place for years now and it has been an absolute delight each time.Their mustard fish is as authentic as it gets and is really really delicious with plain steamed rice. You can also try some of the vegetarian options like fried egg plants or potatoes (called bhajas) or the okra. Their mutton vindaloo is another winner. In fact I have a few friends from India who can‚Äôt wait to get this mutton every time they visit. Their koshe manghsha (mutton cooked in bengali style) is amazing too. Service is lovely with attentive staff, who are happy to explain various dishes and share recommendations.It is a rather cozy outfit and hard to get tables, so getting a reservation in advance is recommended. Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough.. a must visit!
2
The ambience, silverware and deco was good.Service was so & so, we had to wait one hour for food.I ordered naan and aloo gobi, I was NOT informed that naan contained eggs, despite the emphasized that I am vegetarian, but the waiter took no notice of it. Until I wanted to order another naan, that when he advised all naan contains egg. Aloo gobi was not tasty at all, it was bland. Overall experience was not that fantastic, basically one is paying for the ambience and not the food
5
We had the boneless mutton dish which was excellent - the meat was tender and the thick gravy was extremely flavorful. The Chana dal with potato crisps was delicious as well. Good to have roomali rotis after a long time . It‚Äôs a small restaurant and tends to get a bit noisy . Will probably visit it again.
4
Great little boutique of a restaurant of the main drag in Little India. Only about 10 tables so plan accordingly for your visit.Good menu with lots of selections to choose from, curries, tikka, and non-veg. Good quality ingredient and flavor. I left full and satisfied!
5
If you never visit Mustard restaurant, you probably miss up a lot on how fantastic are Indian food tasting. I have visited Mustard for years and they are getting very popular; needs to make advance booking. Mustard is an unusual restaurant compared with others because their menu are from Punjabi area from the Central of India. Because of that unique location they create the best of north and south combination. This restaurant also accepts alcohol tasting to compliment the food. White wine and rose are perfect combination.
2
We went there for bengali food which it claims to serve. But we were totally disapointed. Mustard Rui fish curry and mustard prawn curry both were not at all propet bengali preperation. It appeared only a punjabi restaurant. No bengali should visit this place.
5
Been there thrice now and can't get enough of their sizzling mustard curries! The Bengali cuisine is their highlight as there are lots of other places for Punjabi cuisine. Their chef is Bengali..and all their Bengali dishes be it fish, chicken or lamb, are awesome. The friendly staff offer their insight if you ask for suggestions when ordering food. We really appreciated when the staff advised us that we were ordering too much food when we ordered their famous prawn curry, fish in mustard gravy AND a mutton dish. Pros: Great food, excellent service, easily accessibleCons: Small space, limited table
3
Ordered 3 different curries, they all seemed to have the same sauce (same colour and taste). We were also asked if we wanted it spicy, which we did. However none of the curries were spicy. I had a tastier curry the next day in a hawker center for a quarter of the price.Service was also slow
5
Great food with wonderful flavours, family friendly, ordered too many of their delicious garlic naans!!
4
Good food & nice service. smiling faces & helpful gestures ..!!One extra Star for the wonderful service ...!!
Taste of food can be improved as food could not deliver as per expected ..!!
Will visit again soon üëåüëç
5
Must go and eat their mustard fish! It's a sin to be in Singapore and not eat their food! It also has some Punjabi dishes like saraso ka sag (mustard leaves curry)
4
Unique blend of Punjabi and Bengali dishes on menu. The two starters we had could be improved. The Calcutta samosa advertised cauliflower but didn't find or taste any. The chicken egg rolls also failed to meet the Calcutta taste perhaps as both the egg and chicken quantity was less than desirable. However the main courses were good with the fish in banana leaf, paneer kadai, and dal. The puris were with as little oil as possible. So overall enjoyed it. They allow for 25 dollars a bottle to bring your own wine! Hurrah for tha
1
Clearly the chef has limited knowledge of bengali cuisine. The shorshe ilish (lish in mustard sauce) and the mutton kosha left a lot to be desired. The rice was too dry. And after you place the order the food takes more than 25 mins to arrive! Not going there again
5
I have tried them all or almost. That's my top one. Good service. Nice place. A nice menu, with a map of india that tells you more on what you eat. It tast very good. I'll recommend anyone to go to that one first now. Enjoy.
4
We had been to Mustard over for lunch. Food was fantastic. They serve a mix of punjabi and begali food. Must say that I have not had a better Paneer Kadhai at any place in Singapore. Service was good and prompt.I found the place to be overpriced. A bill of 105$ for 3 veggies, 7 rotis and a sweet dish is definitely pricey.Overall happy, recommend to all to try this place atleast once
4
Just the place in Little India to visit for delicious Bengali cuisine! This place tends to be full up often. So make sure you've reservations in advance to not face disappointment! Once in, you'll find the host very accommodative and adjusting. We had a full table of six and when we felt cramped, they were accommodative enough to offer a change. What we ordered was purely Bengalifare of Aloo Dum,Doi Baingan, Dhokar Dalna along with Chana and Roomali Roti. Alphonso Mango Lassi was my drink. The food tasted great and very different/unique. All tables were taken last Sat evening I noticed by expats from Europe & the US, showcasing the international appeal of the fare! Several guests without reservations had to be turned back, while some even didn't mind taking the two tables seated roadside with no AC on that sweltering evening. So much for the popularity of the place
1
We entered the restaurant at¬†¬†6.45 pm and there were two other tables taken,first question in a very rude tone is so you have a reservation then when we say no he says, OK we'll give you a table but food will take¬†¬†45 mins... Again in a very brusque n impolite tone. Now really, In which normal restaurant ( not a Michelin 5 star haute cuisine place) which has two tables full does¬†¬†food¬†¬†take 45 mins..it was almost as if he didn't want us there so we left.never going there again..
2
Disappointing experience overall. Table wasn't ready when we arrived so we had to wait. Of the three dishes we ordered, two were very poor. One was in a watery sauce that only tasted of mustard. One had hard undercooked chick peas. Manager was kind though, agreed the food was not good, and didn't charge us for those dishes.So they handled it well, but still disappointing overall. Lots of competition in the area that is far cheaper and better.
5
The food is delightful as well as the service. Some of the best Indian Food I've had in Singapore. Make sure to make a booking it's a hot spot.
5
went there for some Indian food and we weren't let down, the standard was so high at very good prices and lovely atmosphere.
4
So good Indian food! The restaurant was full and we didn't have a reservation but there was still room for us. Service was excellent and food was really good! Highly recommending if you are in a Little India and trying to find a place to eat
4
Small restaurant offering food from Bengal and Punjab. The choices were great. Taste wise maybe a little less authentic but still very nice. Loved the kasha mangsho and the desserts. A bit pricey to a Bong who has some of these dishes regularly at home. Very personal service by the owner couple. Decor could be improved a bit.
5
I organised this place for 14 people after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor.The food was superb and the best curry we have had over in Singapore.Everyone one of us gave it a thumbs up.Made a welcome change from most of the other foods we've had.Kingfisher beer was nice and was a very good price.One for us to go back to
4
I had a quick meal on my own at Mustard , so I didn't get a chance to try many of the dishes there. But after sampling the fantastic prawn and coconut curry, I would return in a heartbeat. It was aromatic, had great depth of flavour and was absolutely delicious!! I enjoyed sitting outside at one of the two tables and watching the world go by. Mustard will be on our dining list for our return trip to Singapore- I can't wait to have that curry again
5
Been there with family and enjoyed the variety of authentic and new Indian dishes. The selection is definitely different than typical Indian restaurants. Quality was great (tender chicken and prawns), Currys thick as I like them. Ambience and service very forward looking. Will come back to try other options.
3
I enjoyed this small Bengali restaurant which served North Indian food, the okra and biriyani were good. However, I was disappointed by the Rasa Malai(dessert).The restaurant is very popular and the flip side, on this occasion was a group of happy but noisy diners who had chosen this restaurant to celebrate an event
5
You're not coming to Mustard for the atmosphere but you'll forget that as soon as you sink your teeth into your first bite of whatever you order. The butter chicken not only has an incredibly well made sauce but the chicken itself has an unique grilled flavor complimenting said sauce. The Spinach, Lentils etc all make your mouth a happy camper. That and a jug of Kingfisher and you'll be thanking them over and over again.
4
We tried without a booking during the Diwali festival, to our disappointment they were booked out.Having heard awesome reviews, we went back the next night, and got a table :)We asked for recommendations, as we aren't too savvy on traditional menu items.Fantastic service, recommended a few dishes and said if we want more just let him know. Kingfisher beer paired perfectly with the spicy food and the super hot humid temps outside!Glad we came back, don't miss this one
5
dont be in hurry at this resurant, the food is cooked there and then for you.try as much as you like ,1 serve is big enough for one, but try more
5
We had veg and chicken biryani. Starters were fish. One of us was gluten allergent and the staff was accommodating. Reasonably priced. Compared to the surrounding restaurants this place is a steal (had a bunch of beers too)
4
The chicken tikka and mahi tikka were wonderful. The dishes were beautifully cooked. The portions were a good size. The restaurant is small. The service is slow, but friendly. We left full and happy.
1
The food quality is really great. Credit goes to the chef. But the staff is completely disappointing. All the staff members ignore you and are always in there own world. Need to call them for 3-4 times to get attention. We tried calling a server thrice, but he came up to another table and just went pass. Pathetic person.
4
Visited this place for lunch on a Sunday, but were politely told that reservations are full and that they won't be able to accommodate us by the time lunch time gets over at 3 pm. So we ordered chicken and mutton biryanis for takeaway, and boy! Excellent balanced taste and probably one of the 2 best biryanis in Singapore. The seating area for dine in is elegant as well, but book your tables in advance. Decent value for money: 2 biryanis cost us 29 SGD including taxes.
5
Mustard is a good place to end your day with a happy stomach! The restaurant is located in the bustling district of Little India. The place offers great briyani in Singapore! You have to also try the Chingari macher Malai curry! The people are kind and well mannered. Oh and of courses you would have to book in advance as the place is usually quite fully booked
3
Mustard is the only Bengali cuisine restaurant in Singapore.But it has no Bengali cook and the owners are also non Bengali. Being a Bengali myself I can comment that the food is barely Bengali. The Hilsa fish cost S$ 25 upwards for two pieces. Exorbitant price but taste was terrible. Luchi costs S$ 2.5 each! The quality was average. Cost of lunch for 4 persons was S$ 150/ when one member was a vegetarian. Came back unsatisfied
5
One of my favourite restaurants. This is not a chain restaurant. It's a small restaurant with home style cooking. You won't get the quick pre-made dishes. Instead, they have a long menu. A lot of the dishes are not the usual "North Indian" dishes. I suggest one visit when one has the time for a longer dinner. Get the kebab platter, beer. The mains will take their time to appear. If you go early, the wait is not long. If the kitchen is slammed, it takes time. But just enjoy the evening out.Try the Bengali dishes. They are all pretty good and different, but accessible. Ask for suggestions if you are not sure what to get. The Bengalis are known for their love of fish. The chicken rezalla works really well for my guests. The doi maach is a simple fish dish (eat it with rice not naans). The cholar dal, doi dharos, and the begun (eggplant) are all excellent. The biryani is excellent.I am not sure why so many people are focusing on the dishes you get at so many other places. Chicken tikka masala: hmm. The gastronomic delight of every pub in the U.K. You can get those if you want. But really, there are almost no Bengali restaurants in Singapore or in other major cities of the world. Try those
3
This was our third visit here as we love the food here. But the service is absolutely pathetic. Everytime we came thinking it would have improved but unfortunately its just the same. No improvement in service. Very very slow. One has to wait minimum 40 mins for a starter.Will not come agai
3
Mustard is a good bet when you want to complement your usual favourite North Indian dishes with something different - in this case Bengali: starters like Kathi rolls, macher fish cutlets served with pungent mustard oil; seafood like the signature prawn curry served in a coconut; etc. Try unusual drinks like the Aam Ka Panna (green mango juice with Indian spices). They also serve flavourful Punjabi dishes. Cooking can be quite slow, so don't come here if you're in a hurry
5
We loved the food. Achari chicken tikka deserves a special mention! The service was excellent too.
Highly recommend the place.
4
Intimate and cosy environment, good service and best of all, awesome food. We have come back twice to eat the same dishes and still love it. have rest of the menu to go through - yum yum.
5
Nice food, great service. Visiting for last 10 years and will keep on visiting. Worth eating both north Indian and Bengali cuisine. Bengali dishes prepared here are yummy!!
5
My wife and I had a wonderful meal and enjoyed fabulous service (thankyou Johnny). Simple restaurant, wonderful food (mutton biryani, chicken tikka, okra and starters and sides) for S$120. Will be back!
4
I have reviewed this before but just go........Superb Bengali/Punjabi food served by lovely people and at a great price.Hard to suggest what to eat - everything I have had has been as ordered - right level of spice, etcBeer is well priced and walk outside to the great markets of Little India - superb spices/fruits/veg at good prices
3
I must admit I'd heard quite a bit of hype about Mustard from various people in Singapore, mu wife and I had dinner with friends here and we're always willing to try new places. The restaurant is pleasant enough, albeit slight cramped and we had picked a particularly bad night as the restaurant had been taken over by a large group, mainly kids so we couldn't hear ourselves think.The food was ok but average apart from the puri's which were delicious. I guess I am being a little critical but worth trying for first timers
4
You need to book especially at the weekends.This is a small family run place with both Punjabi and Bengali dishes.Subtle tandoori fish,wonderful dry mutton curry and greaseless almost tempura like onion bhajia are washed down with ice cold Kingfisher.A charming ambience with effective aircon makes this one of the best if not the best place to go in Little India.We shall be back 
5
Last year October, I had visited the place for dinner. We had to wait for more than 30 minutes for our food to be served. When I brought a foreign friend along this time round, I had pre- empted him of this. Unbeknownst to me, the services have improved and the serving times have reduced to a tolerable waiting time. :) Brought a foreign friend to one of my favourite Indian restaurant. We had ordered butter naan, garlic naan, palak paneer (my favourite!), succulent chicken pieces marinated with black pepper and chana masala. We came out with thumbs- up and full bellies. ‚úå
5
A visit to Mustard is always special. It is one of those rare restaurants that has never failed us in terms of food and service. Myself and my wife always enjoy having lunch / dinner at this restaurant. Our favorite has always been Chaas, Makki di Roti with sarson da saag, roomali roti, doi dharos and many more vegetarian dishes. I really can't comment on the non-vegetarian dishes as i don't eat them. My colleagues did like the prawns with coconut when we dined with them recently.A tip from me is to call them and make a reservation before you go because this place is FULL especially on weekends!!
4
We were a group of 8 and visited for dinner. It took awhile to get the drinks and food. But!!! When the food came it was delicious. My personal favorite was the prawn coconut curry and fish tikka. Really yummy. There is a large selection of veg options too.
3
We liked the North Indian food. Service is very slow. You won't be given a table if you don't reserve in advance. Folks are curt, bordering on rude.
4
A small nice Indian restaurant in little India. we waited for a while after we ordered, but everything was good there. decent service, reasonably priced; I walked out there satisfied.
5
This is the third time in two trips to Singapore that I've come here. The food is well prepared. It is Punjab, so a nice change from the predominantly southern Indian places in little India. Dinner for one, without beer, just a bread and chicken dish was about S$ 22.50. well worth a visi
5
This small cafe style Indian restaurant is a hidden gem, and I almost don't want to tell you how good it is.The staff are attentive and informative , explaining the difference between the Bengali and Punjabi dishes.Chicken is fresh and boned and the fish dishes are all cooked well and flavoursome.The staff Ensure you have it spiced as you like it and accompanied by a great array for breads from paratha to naan to roti.Kingfisher beer is served along with draft Tiger, and there is a reasonable wine list if you want.The price is very good and the food so tasty that you will want to return.A great find
4
I have been there twice (the place was originally recommended by a friend) and each time it was a good and simple experience. The food is good and thin, special mention for the Butter chicken, the chicken tikka and the black dhal. The service is good as well. The bill might be a bit more expensive than any other Indian restaurant in Singapore (that rather looks like canteen most of the time) but it is definitely worth it 
1
I'm a Bengali who grew up in Delhi, so arguably well positioned to judge a 'Punjabi-Bengali' restaurant. Not only have I cooked better Bengali food on any given Sunday in my kitchen, the Punjabi food is also abysmal at best. We got kathi rolls (ok, not juicy enough), prawn malai curry (a joke - just 4 shrimp floating in flavorless coconut milk), kosha mangsho (supposed to be melt in your mouth lamb but this was tough chewy pieces and gross), palak paneer (saving grace of the main course). Naan was so-so. Really do yourselves a favor and dig up a better place in Singapore for north Indian food. Prices were also way too high for the portion size. I truly think this place is for expats that have never tasted authentic Indian cuisine
4
Supper at Mustard was lovely - mixed starters of chicken tandoori, bhajis and the potato 'chop' - the latter being filled with coriander mix and best course of the night for me. Followed by prawn main course with garlic and peshwari naan and pilau rice, all chased down by some tiger beer. Would definitely eat here again
3
We went there over a weekend evening, thanks to tipS here, we had reserved in advance. We got our table right away, but it takes a while for the rest of the wait services. Perhaps they're short staffed. However the ambience and decor is really good (for it being a mid range small restaurant), even though space is tight.We went there primarily to taste the Bengali cuisine, so I don't speak here about any of the Punjabi dishes. The Bong dishes were very average, would not return for these. We ordered the Ilish, a very popular iconic Bengali dish - sadly not great. The other dish we ordered was the mutton (kosha mangsho), as it was mentioned in some posts here. Meh, not anything to write home about.The Bengalis are famed for their desserts, so naturally we ordered the famous rasamalai - this one too did not live up to expectations (the rasgulla in the rasamalai in a good rasamalai should not ooze ras (sugar syrup), when bit into, it should be infused with the milky rasa of rasamalai)The restaurant is not overly priced, if only the taste of the dishes could be improved (made authentic), I'd pay the amount they charge for an uncommon cuisine, in good ambience
3
This place is located on the race course road near to the Little India MRT exit. We visited this place since we wanted to try out the traditional bengali spicy food. As soon as we entered the waiter there said that the wait time for the order to be served is between 30-45 min. We were stunned but wanted to give it a try, hence, decided to wait. The food was okay, it was little on the sweeter side but overpriced. The ambiance was good and masala chai seemed to be popular amongst the people who had come there
5
We went to Mustard, a group of 9 on a friends recommendation who was with us. Our timing was good, we got place in 10 mins.Ambiance - It is a small restaurant but still you would love it. Wooden, catchy, contemporary, a bit of Old Indian style touch with modern feeling. The cutlery is worth mentioning, we loved it.Service - very personalized. All our needs were first understood and then delivered based on our mood. Very friendly and quick service considering that it was a weekend dinner. Cheerful people.Food - Loved the concept and fusion of Punjabi and Bengali cuisine . This restaurant serves Punjabi and Bengali dishes, authentic. So you can explore both. We set our moods with some drinks and kids were made busy with some amazing parathas and ‚Äòdaal without chilli - custom made‚Äô. We tried Beguner Shirazi, a bengali vegetable dish and then we repeated it. It was very good.Desserts- Excellent is the world. We ordered 5-6 desserts. Pati Shapta stood out among all.Price - Medium to High. If you order drinks, food, dessert it is bound to be on a higher side!We are definitely coming back
3
We went there to celebrate a special day after reading so many good reviews specially to have authentic Bengali food. There were lots of option in the menu but we didn't find it really Worth. It's not the best place for Bengali cuisine.
5
Best chicken tikka masala and dal we have ever had. Flavorful and simply presented. The fish biryani was cooked to perfection. Atmosphere is friendly and familiar. Server was pleasant and made excellent recommendations. Would definitely return on the next visit.
5
Found this restaurant by chance and was so pleased I did. Food and service were outstanding. I'm still dreaming about the Samosa
3
I had a lamb chop which was listed as a house specialty lamb was very tender should have been called " pulled lamb" Along with a cumin rice and plain nann it made for a nice lunch though nothing spectacular
5
My ExPat friends always bring me here. I just love this place. The menu is extensive and the outstanding. Really, this is one of my favorite Indian places in the world. I dream about the butter chicken and the cheese naan is well, divine.

Mustard, on Race Course Road, is a few minutes walk from Little India Metro Station. A variety of Indian Cuisine - Punjabi, Bengali etc - is on offer. Every Dish is well prepared with Authentic, Regional Taste & Flavour. Even after-dinner Masala Chai is superbly prepared ! The ambience inside the compact dining area is Creatively Artistic & Aesthetically Indian. While tariff is distinctly on the higher side, it is Value-for-Money. An expensively Delightful Dining experience 
1
At 7.50pm this evening I tried to get a table at Mustard, Race Course Road, Singapore. Although there were EMPTY tables inside the air conditioned restaurant I was asked to sit outside.When I told them to put "Reserved" signs to avoid any misunderstanding I was told I should have made a reservation! Absolute Disgraceful Service!!
4
We had lunch in Mustard restaurant on Race Course road. It specialises in Bengali food. I was told that it is the best of its class in Singapore. I found the food as good as in Oh Calcutta in Kolkata. Chingri Dab and Kalibari Cutlet were very good. Others were good too. Seating space is less. Better to book a table. Lunch for four was for approx S$125
5
The food in mustard was good and delicious. They had this mustard sauce that was good and first we ordered for a tanga hot and sour soup which was non-veg. Then we ordered for a fish cult let and we had that with the mustard sauce it was good and we had a maaachar jhol, and what else we had was the prawn masala which was served in a coconut and it tasted very good and the drink that I had was mango lassi. For dessert we had a kulfi and rasgulla. My mom had the the rasgulla and I had the kulfi. This restaurant was famous for fish and the food has tasted very good
5
Been to Mustard 4-5 times and really want to keep going back.The food here is really nice...like the Samosa (bengalii version), fish cutlets, Bengali Dal with vegetables and Prawn curry served in a traditional coconut.Having all of this with a portion of Mustard makes for wonderful Bengali meal and top with RasgullaLove the Bengali Dhal with all vegetables have ev
5
Delicious, finger licking indian food in a foreign land. Popular among Europeans for its bengali cuisines.
Must try luchi & mutton.
4
I really enjoy the food here. It's spicy without being over done. Really tasty and service is efficient and friendly. Great place for dinner with friends.
1
Would not say it is the best Restaurant by my opinion the owners can be more friendly to everyone and not only for tourists.
5
Little India in Singapore is traditionally known for a large spread of South Indian restaurants mostly from Tamil Nadu. So when my son suggested we try this Bengali place,we said why not? How very right he was for we were treated to some mouthwatering fare of Indian spread from Bengal. Whether it be the spicy Biryani or the Bhendi or the Baingon or the Alu, each was tastier than the other. A must visit place for anyone keen on good Indian food. We will certainly return
4
We visit this place for it's Bengali cuisine, which isn't commonly available in most Indian restaurants. The food is excellent, the prices slightly steep (but worth it because of the quality), the place is generally packed for dinner (so get a reservation) and the service swings between excellent to overwhelmed depending on how crowded the restaurant is.Bengali cuisine is slightly different from mainstream North Indian cuisine in that it is heavily meat / seafood oriented and makes liberal use of mustard and coconut. Best Bengali dishes here include - Kosha Mangsho (spicy and rich mutton curry), Doi Maach (fish in yoghurt sauce), malai curry (prawns in a coconut milk based sauce) and mutton biryani. The dessert selection does justice to Bengal's rich heritage of sweet-making.Very highly recommended, to taste a new aspect of Indian cuisine. Meatlovers and folks with a sweet tooth will not return disappointed
5
Everything about Mustard in Little India was fabulous. The friendly, helpful wait person made suggestions for our shared lunch dishes. The meals delivered were wonderful, very aromatic with yummy flavours. It was very busy for lunchtime, the staff informed us the food would take time to prepare. The short wait was absolutely worth it. We loved the coconut used as a serving dish. Visit here as one of the best in little India's numerous food choices. We couldn't have chosen a better!

I had brought my friends who visited from India to this restaurant. Need to make reservation as it is very popular and also because the premise is small. The moment we had entered the restaurant, the service staff had been attentive to us, serving drinks, taking in our orders, gave recommendations, managing our expectations on the waiting time. The butter naan was crispy and yummy and the spinach saag was thumb up. The food was so good that we had stopped chatting (haha!) and just focus on eating. All in all, it was a good choice to bring friends along to this restaurant as the vibe is friendly and there is nothing to grouse on. :)
5
I rarely write restaurant reviews but the food here was amazing. Loads of vegetarian options as well as plenty of meat and fish. Absolutely delicious - I tried the lentil "cakes" in a curry sauce and the potato-stuffed naan. Paid $30 for a whole curry, half a rice, half a naan (shared with a friend) and a soft drink. Not a budget option but definitely a great option for Indian food-lovers
5
This restaurant has been my favourite for Bengali cuisine, probably it's the only Bengali restaurant in Singapore. Few typical Bengali dish like shorsey macho(fish prepared with mustard), Doi Baigon(eggplant cooked with curd) are my favourite. A must try place to experience speciality foods from eastern India
5
Having been to few Indian restaurants in Singapore I must say that this was by far the best. Service is bit slow to get going but when the food is on your table you forget it all and just dig into high quality Indian fare!! will be back on my next trip :
4
Decent Indian food but not exactly cheap.Was here with family and friend. It has good ambience and judging from the almost full restauranton on a Tuesday night, this must be a popular place.
5
Food service and ambience was great. Recommend you come early as the place has limited tables and fills up quickly. Menu is a mix of Punjabi food which is creamier and less spicy than the Bengali dishes.
4
Mustard's not exactly cheap, but the food and service are both great. I love their luchis and kosho mangsho. And the steamed fish with mustard.
4
The cuisine is unique and is absolutely amazing. its a nice decent joint with an amazing cast to serve deliciously cooked Kalabari Chops, Puri & Chana-daal, Kebabs & the Rotis and of course the always great Old Monks.
4
A very good spot. The front of house staff aren't brilliant, but once you get to know them you put up with the reluctant service. But the food is very good. The kitchen staff are what makes this place a must visit.
4
The food is absolutely wonderful. It's always a pleasure to come here. We have sampled the vegetarian and non- vegetarian food - ample choice in each! Please make reservations though, it's always packed on weekends
5
Had lunch at Mustard with colleagues of various nationalities and everyone is full of praises for the food. Mild spicy which caters to most people. My personal favourites: fish tikka, cheese naan with paneer butter masala. Ending the meal with mango lassi, satisfying.
5
The restaurant was really quiet for our weekday evening visit. Usually not a good sign but I'm increasingly finding it results in better service and this was the case. We weren't feeling too hungry so only ordered a few dishes but what we had was really great - possibly one of the best Indian meals I've had
3
Mustard has been on Racecourse road for a while and I decided to try them out.This is one of the better looking restaurants on that road.The service is very swift, friendly and knowledgeable. The staff are willing to make suggestions and at the same time take into account special requests.My favorite there is the Chicken Kathi roll and the Kakori Kabab.My wife is very partial towards their fish cutlets and the fish curry.In terms of prices, this is not an expensive place and you feel that you have received value for your money.I've never had a chance to try their dessert yet and perhaps next time I will
4
Went for lunch on weekend Saturday. The restaurant seems popular and filled quickly. This is the first time ever we tried Bengali cuisine, took help from serving staff and their recommendations was excellent.Had Koraishutir Kochuri ar aloo torkari got small portion only) which is puffed bread with potato veggie along with Mango lassi which was really delicious. Main course in non-veg we tried Tel Jhol on staff recommendation. Ut was Rohu fish in mustard gravy, mild spicy with Basmati Rice and Roomali roti.It was fresh and tasty.Bengali sweets are famous and we tried Pati Shapta (Excellent), Malpua (very small portion) and Rasgulla (a bit disappointing considering its a Bengali restaurant).Overall a satisfying meal with good service. Rates were reasonable
4
We had two different types of curry with nan, some tandoori chicken and beers.
The experience overall was positive, but we didn't find it great.
The staff is kind and always helpful.
I don't know what is missing here, but anyway we're very satisfied.
5
Being an Bengali, I loved the food there. You have options for Punjabi and Bengali cusine! We tried Rohu, Daab Chingri, both were top-class! Averagely costly!
5
Excellent service: prompt, friendly, efficient. Menu.Menu extensive. Food delicious. Beer cold. Air con at a good temperature. Overall a wonderful meal. would go there again. in the Little India area.Accessible.
5
One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to. Go with the server's recommendations. Gulab jamen for dessert is perfection.
5
I have to write a minimum of 100 words so ok . OH MY GOD this is amazing Indian restaurant, not so posh inside and not a fancy pants place but brilliant. It's so popular with the indian population which is always a good sign. The food is delicious , the restaurant was full. They have a good selection of food and it is cooked fresh. Very good for vegetarians . Wow . It's not easy to find but worth searching, walk past all those posh looking restaurants in Little India and straight into this. Don't worry about the non fancy part it is good good good. Try it really it's worth it.
5
There was nothing we had that wasn't fantastic.Still dreaming about the Butter Chicken. Service was good and the food quality above par. My Singaporean Expat friends swear by this place and I don't disagree. Yes it's small, yes it's crowded, yes it's noisy. It's Little India at its best. Go, order lots and enjoy! You won't be disappointed
2
In my humble opinion there was a time when Mustard used to very good but the last I went which was yesterday, I was quite disappointed with the food. Taste wise very average...kalibadi chod was just boiled potatoes stuff with boiled peas ( no taste in the mashed potatoes or pears...perhaps stir flying the potatoes in some sort of masala first would give it a kick). The fish curry I ordered was also quite average..didn't jump out. A year or two back I used to look forward to eating the same dish there. The size, taste and portion of the kathi rolls have gone down. I wouldn't go back to Mustard in a hurry
5
The food at this joint is so good I wish I could have it all the time.Order the masala papadums - to die for. And the curry prawn. And the okra in yoghurt. And the mutton dishes. And the cheese paneer. And the naans. And...Basically stuff your face while you are there. You HAVE to make reservations though - the place is not that big and it is always packed
4
Not full house yet had to wait pretty long for the food. However, the appetizers will tide you over your hunger pangs. Naans are great tasting with coconut prawn curry. Personal favourite is coconut naan. This was the only place we had this & we loved it. Will come back just for the coconut naan. Can be a dessert ;
5
We read some reviews and decided to try this restaurant. We were not disappointed as the menu. is extensive and the food delicious. The presentation was lovely, with flower petals scattered along the length of the table. Many locals were eating and I always think that this is a good sign
4
We have had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant previously. The dishes are well prepared and never fail to delight. We intend to dine there again whenever we return to Singapore
4
Two of my favorites are next to each other in Little India. Food at Mustard is lovely and consistent. Service is friendly. It does take awhile to get your food, but definitely worth the wait.
5
Almost every couple of months over the last 7 years we have gone there as a family ... Children like it and we have very little debate about this one place
5
The extensive menu has a wide range of dishes with interesting flavours. Everything we had was simply delicious. The service was good and the restaurant has a pleasant ambience. The air-con was a little cold, but we could have sat outside if we had wanted to. Mustard is conveniently located close to both Little India & Farrer Park MRT. Four of us ate bread, entree & main, fruit juice, 2 beers & a glass of wine for SGD135. I wish that I had left room to have something from their interesting selection of desserts.I would highly recommend Mustard and will certainly return
5
This is THE Indian restaurant in little India! Really a great place, always fully booked but worth a wait! Great food and great service! Try the Briani and the masala lamp chop! I would really recommend this restaurant for:- great food- great service- good priceI will surely be there for my next visit
4
Must book a table in advance, or else risk waiting for atleast 30-45 mins during peak hrs! A simple,cozy indian restaurant with friendly, polite service and scrumptious indian food! Spice levels not very high, so if you like tongue burning spices then specify in advance! Their prawn gravy in fresh coconut was not only delicious but also creatively presented and the most popular dish - every table in restaurant had one! Their maki roti and saag was awesome - must try for vegetarians!! All in all good indian food sans the overpowering and garish interiors, associated with indian restaurants!! Put it on top of your list
5
Having lived in Singapore for more than two years, I've come to really appreciate the varieties of Indian cuisines on offer. The point of difference that makes Mustard unique is they promote themselves as "Singapore's first and only Bengali and Punjabi Restaurant."Our server, Vijay made excellent recomendations when my guest stated she wanted chicken. I had one of their signature dishes, the Chingri Maacher Malai Curry: "succulent prawns simmered in a mildly hot coconut cream spiked with cinnamon, cloves and cardamom." What I really appreciated was Vijay gently suggesting that we only order one starter, as the mains were rather rich. Though we couldn't finish our mains, we had to try one of their signature desserts as well. Again we followed Vijay's suggestion of the "Rossomalai; cottage cheese patties soaked in cardamom flavoured thickened milk." The menu description doesn't do justice to how much we enjoyed this dessert! Atypical of most Indian desserts I have tried, this was not as cloyinging, toothache-inducingly, syrupy sweet.The setting was more upscale and the prices were a little higher than some of the other dining choices in Little India. In this case, the wonderful, unique food and warm, attentive service made for a dining experience that felt like a great bargain
5
What a treat. I am very fond of Indian food, and was not let down. Was for dinner two days ago, and went back for lunch today... I love eggplant, and they offer three different preparations. Had two of them, excellent. - Great naan assortment. Tandoori eat. meats great, Highly recommend i
4
This little hole in the wall punjabi/bengali indian restaurant makes some awesome food. It is a small restaurant with probably 30-40 tables so it does fill up fast. I had the chicken tikka masala curry and fish grill - don't remember the exact name of the dishes. They were delicious. Plan on waiting a while for your food - i think this is an improvement opportunity for these guys. But food is worth the wait. Will definitely be back here
5
I never discovered this place in my early days in Singapore but when I found it this was a find. The north Indian Punjabi and Bengali food is excellent and so unique that you can usually never find in Indian restaurants this selection. The food is well made, fragrant and very traditionally made. I ordered with a dish called "Makke di roti and sarson da saag" and this was the best I have eaten outside of India. The Bengali dishes of fish fry and sea food are unique and very nicely executed. The Bengali desserts the famous "Rasogulla" is just out of this world! The ambience in the evenings is cosy but please book in advance since they are always full. I would give this place a 10 out of 10 for authentic north India style of food. It sticks to two main types of cuisine and has done absolute justice
4
fully booked but they managed to get us in, we try something different each time and its always nice, Nan bread is fresh and tasty. service was a little slow but we were right behind 4 tables who just ordered in front of us.
4
nice food good place .. at least for simple dinner.. I like their original taste food.. but too bad, it takes time to serves the food onto the table..
5
my husband took me their to try their lovely mustard sauce saubji..(like mixed veggie in mustard sauce...
and their dal makhani was excellent.
even the rumali roti n garlic nan r yummy:)
we really enjoyed our dining exp.
lovely
3
Food in this retaurant is good but very congested. Seating is not comfortable at all especially while going with kids. You have to have patience of waiting after ordering food (first item itself takes more than 45mins). Never go to the restaurant in hungry mood.
5
Six of us arrived early for our booking on a hot and humid February evening and were welcomed by the staff with cool ales and refreshing juices. We ordered a variety of dishes, both 'hot' and average; all well received. Staff attention was great, despite the restaurant slowly getting busier as the night progressed. Would happily return next time I'm visiting Singapore
2
Visited today at lunchtime and the restaurant was fairly busy.Seemed to have a nice authentic charm so decided to eat here.We ordered papadums for 3 people to share but out came j think 1-2 small ones broken into pieces served in a small bowl!!Dips were ok although the chutney was not what I was expecting at all. We orderd 2 different types of breads which lacked any flavor and did not match the menu description, what was more they were tiny. The mains we had were good and tasty but the sides let it down badly and did not compliment the mains. It's not cheap either so was let down. Would eat here again if as a last resort hope there are better ones here in little India.
5
If you look at my reviews, you might notice that I eat in a lot of Indian restaurants just about where ever I go. I also try to have the same dishes every time. Samosa, palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, naan bread. While at Mustard I cut out the Samosa but the palak and the equivalent of chicken tikka masala were fantastic. Possibly some of the best I've had. It was really really good. Based on these two dishes I would love to return with a much larger group and sample a wider range of dishes. As can be expected there are many indian restaurants in Little India and I only experienced two of them. But, based on my experience at many other Mustard is a keeper. Visit here if you are in Singapore and are in the need of a curry fix
3
Full marks for innovative menu, bringing a few new flavours and dishes to the standard Indian offerings. Service was good, flavours were different and the food nicely presented. The prices were a little higher than average and the value is the only thing that reduced this to an "average" rating.Definitely worth a visit if you feel adventurous
3
Came in for a late lunch and the restaurant was not packed, regardless we still had to wait around 60mins after ordering for the food to be served. The food was above average, however, it may have tasted better due to our extreme hunger from the wait
4
For all who like Bengali food, this is the place to be! Their starters are quite good, esp Koraishuttir Kachori. Biriyani is good and so is the fish dishes (Maacher Paturi)Small place, very less staff which makes the wait a bit of a turn off. Advisable to book before you go to avoid dissapointment and a long waiting time
5
Food: 9/10Atmosphere: 8/10Variety: 9/10Service: 7/10This is a must try Indian restaurant with absolutely fantastic food. Great palak paneer, smoky aubergine baingan bharta etc etc only let down was service - mainly because restaurant was very busy though so understandable. Best in Little India - just pipping Aromas of India which is also v v good
5
We had a craving for curry and little time so we took the mrt to little India and searched for somewhere close to the station. We found mustard very close and liked the variety of the menu at reasonable prices. We are not spicy people and had a murgh makani and a prawn butter massala. The food was very tasty and we devoured it all. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We would definitely go back agai
3
Overall experience was very dish specific. The vegetarian dishes Beguner Shirazi (Brinjal in a semi dry curry) and daal tadka were really nice. The non vegetarian dishes, not so good (as per my accompanying meat eating friend Hasan). The Kosha Mangsho, mutton was not as tender as the menu made it out to be and the chicken tikka turned out to be dry. The recommendation of the chef to order Roomali rotis turned out to be a good one
4
Omg. ..authentic bengali( a state in Eastern part of India known for its fishes) food in Little India SingaporePaturi ... is baked fish In mustardDoi baigan... brinjal in yoghurtChicken rezalla. ..out of this worldThe food was refreshing, full of flavours n service was great. Went with my 9 year old kiddo n hubby...We loved the food so much that we catered for my kiddo birthday food from here.
5
Have been visiting this wonderful place and each time have planned my next visit to be very soon. Very riendly staff. Being a vegetarian, I am very fond of the samosas to begin with :) for accompaniment - Aam panna / masala chhas (butter milk) are my personal favorites. The main course has been usually curry based paneer (cottage cheese) dishes, I also tribute my new found fondness towards eggplant at this place - try the Beguner Shirazi. for spicy mustard flavor try the shorshey sobji - mixed veges in mustard paste. for meat lovers, have been told the prawn malai curry is a hot favorite - served in green coconut - to go along - try the fluffed puris or onion kulchas. enough of spices - lets get to desserts - malpua and rosogullas are my favorite and surely must try. slurp, am already feeling hungry writing this one :
3
Extensive menu for bengali and punjabi food. But, nothing special in the menu. There are better punjabi (north indian) food options in that area. Bengali food we had tastes just average. Nothing special. I read menu and, it looks good. Over priced. So, i was expecting better bengali food.Overall pricey restaurant for an average indian food
4
I believe this is where a local Indian will go and take his family out for dinner. Its a small restaurant, seems family run and the staff were very nice.The menu can seem complicated if you are not familiar with Indian cuisine. Prices are fair for Singapore. Food was good, not exceptional
4
I've been to quite a few place in Little India now and this is one of the best. The keema muttar is the best I've tasted in Singapore and the chicken tikka is worth having too. There is a house special prawn dish (served in a coconut!) which is a bit rich for my taste, but still worth trying. As is often the case in these places, the drinks selection is limited but sufficient and the service is friendly. Would definitely recommend
4
MUSTARD has been around for 8 years but today was the first time I decided to visit it for lunch with my wife. It was about 2pm on a Saturday. The restaurant specializes in Bengali and Punjabi cuisine. The menu has a great variety of dishes. Not only are there more than 20 dishes of fish and meat, and vegetable too but the bread section also has some 20 different varieties to choose from.The restaurant is small and has a nice ambience. The decor in the restaurant is tasteful. It has a capacity of about 30 people.For drinks my wife had the mango lassi. It was all right for her although she has had better ones in other restaurants. I decided to be more adventurous and try the Aam Ka Panna, an Indian summer drink made from raw green mangoes with added spices. It was a light green drink and had a beautiful balance of sweet and sour flavors. I enjoyed it tremendously and would recommend that you try it too. We were served on the house with the usual papadam and dip as do other Northern Indian restaurants. But unlike the dips of other restaurants which is usually mango chutney or mint or Indian pickle, their dip had an interesting taste. We found out that it is made from mint, spinach and peanuts. The combination made an unusually interesting and tasty dip.For starters,my wife and I shared their special Kolkata Kathi Egg Roll Kebab made from soft flaky flour bread filled with onions, cucumber, omelette and a subtle hint of tomato sauce. The bread is soft and tasty and not hard and chewy. It was light and made an excellent starter.For our main course, we had keema matar (minced mutton, peas and spiced gravy) and Begunar Shirazi (eggplant dish) together saffron rice. The dishes were excellent, rich in spices, tasty and moderately hot. But then again I may have gotten used to spicy hot food. The Caucasian tourist sitting at the table behind me needed a box of tissue to wipe the beads of sweat on his forehead because of the 'moderately' hot food. Actually, you just need to tell them how hot you like your food and they would make it the way you want it. This is stated in their menu. Also stated in their menu is that all their meats are halal.As my wife and I do not have a sweet tooth, we refrained from trying their desserts. All in all, it was a pleasant dining experience and the food was sumptuous and value for money. Will we return again? Most definitely
5
The restaurant was very close to Little india mrt, less than 1 minute walking distance. Bengali and punjabi dishes are serve there. Sarson ka saag te makki di roti was excellent and specially the person who served the food, he served with a warm smile. In sweet rasomalai was superb , must try. Soft music, friendly staff, tasty food, everything was fantastic.
3
Service Good but food is just satisfactory. Long wait for Food preparation. Not worth the wait.
Dishes preparation is fresh as they claimed. May be worth a go if you want Indian food and are prepared to wait
3
Great food . Have been coming on regular bss but the waiting is just becoming RIDICULOUS..
1 hour ++ for simple indian dish on a monday evening ...
4
Had Makki roti/sarson saag and Bengali Dhokka for main course, Malpua for sweet. Enjoyed food, fresh and tasted well, one of few Non-South Indian Indian restaurants that I have liked in Singapore so far. Service was very good, we sat there for 2 hours on a Friday evening and no one rushed us, that itself speaks a lot about caring for customer. Space is small but it is neat and well kept. Overall very good experience.
4
They serve good bengali food. Everytime i go i love the food. Only place they need improvement is probably get more servers. Only two. The place is a bit small but that can't be helped much. If you want to go best do a reservation or you may not be able to get a place, esp Fri-Sun.DIshes that i would recommend, bengali fish fry, chingdi(prawn) malai curry, chholar daal, alu dom, bengali shingara(samosa) and luchi.Went with my in-laws, they loved it
4
Dropped in on an impulse to have lunch. Was apprehensive reading some of the previous reviews but was pleasantly surprised. The food took some time to come as the restaurant was full, but more than made up for the delay by the taste. Cannot comment on the authenticity of the cuisine as I am not familiar with Bengali food, but it tasted good.Portions were small, and the food could have been hotter.Otherwise enjoyable
1
We went for dinner last night. There is nothing good I can say about the restaurant from food portions, taste, to service.  Service - we asked for nut free as my son is severely allergic to nuts. They guaranteed that the dishes we had ordered were nut free however my son still had a reaction - this was not the problem as it can happen sometimes with cross contamination. The problem was the staff, not once did they apologise and infact delayed our getting to the hospital by counting out the cents required for the bill - absolutely atrocious! Furthermore in the rush and panic, my husband left his phone there and later when he went back to get it, the attitude was worse, again forget the apology, they didn't even ask how my son was!!!Taste/Food - there was nothing authentic about the food. The punjabi chicken curry and kosha mutton were tasteless. Morever, the chicken pieces in the curry were awful cuts - parts of the chicken that should not be served!!!The hot and sour soup was loaded with black pepper and left a very strong after taste. Portion - portion sizes was too small. We ordered a mutton biryani and there were 2 (yes you read right 2) pieces of mutton in the whole biryani!! It was def overpriced based on the portion size. We also asked for some simple chopped onion and green chilli. Most Indian restaurants will give this free as well as pappadums and chutney at the start. Despite ordering 7 dishes and drinks, the owner told us this was chargeable. And this was after making us wait for ages for our food!!!!Overall it was an awful experience and I would not recommend this restaurant
2
I usually make sure that I eat at any restaurant at least three times over the course of at least 6 months before I give any review. Unfortunately over time this restaurant has not got any better. The service is extremely slow, food comes out cold and it just seems over priced. On the 3 occasions I went with another adult and two children it took about 25 mins for the starters to come out and then a further 40 mins once the starters had finished for the mains to arrive. Most of the food was cold and to be honest didn't taste that great (but the presentation was nice). Each time the bill was over SGD140.The staff are extremely nice but there always seem to be the same 2 or 3 people outside serving (looks like the owners) and then one chef. Restaurant itself looks nice if a little small. The loos situated next to the kitchen are not very hygienic and do smell. On the whole....if you are looking for experience then go to Punjab Grill at MBS but if you are looking for good traditional indian grub with a bit of ambience then I would probably go to Muthus down the road...half the bill, speediest service and just generally cleaner in the areas that matter. Sorry Mustard but you are definitely off the list
4
Ate there tonight and the fare was good but no better than any half decent Indian restaurant. Wasn't crazy about the peshawari naan.I was annoyed that it took five requests to provide iced water. The owner obviously prefers if you drink his $25 jugs of Tiger Beer.I wouldn't refuse to go back but I would definitely try others before returnin
4
We've been here a few times and the food and service have been mostly good. We've tried a variety of dishes including the Palak Paneer, Egg Curry, Biryani, Naans, and some starters. The quality's been consistently high and the service has always been pleasant. It is a tad overpriced for the portion size, however, we do dine there despite that, considering the food is wholesome and non-greasy, unlike multiple other Indian restaurants in Singapore
1
Off late this place is becoming very unpredictable . Clearly the chef has no clue of what he is making and everything tastes the same. Seems they are using the same gravy base for atleast all the three dishes that we ordered. Doi Mach was nothing like what it's supposed to be same for the chicken razella. The breads continue to be nice though. Quite disappointed this time. This used to be nice place for authentic bengali foo
4
Food is great, service just ok in our case. But definitely worth to go to! You might want to reserve a table on busy nights in advance.
4
Don't be confused by its simple appearance, this is a great little restaurant in the Little India section of Singapore. It is not upscale or expensive - next to us was a table with six college age kids who had a great time - but the menu has a great number of excellent, mostly Bengal, dishes.The biryanis especially can be recommended. Service is competent and friendly, and you never have a feeling that you should hurry up. Very reasonably priced
4
From the outside, you would not imagine that this restaurant would be anything special, but the food is on another level. There are only about 15 tables so if you are not able to make a reservation there could be a wait before you are seated. The menu has a good choice of dishes to satisfy most tastes at good prices. The food is simply presented and delicious, cooked to the spice level you prefer. Service is good and the staff are very friendly and happy to give advice on the dishes. A great place to get a taste of authentic Indian food and highly recommended.
5
We've eaten here three times this month, and no dish we had was less than good, and most were really delicious. We particularly appreciated the very helpful tall dark haired waiter who stopped us ordering too much food on one occasion, and made really good suggestions on another.Delicious food and good service makes Mustard a winner
4
As the name states, the restaurant uses mustard as the base ingredient for most dishes and this hints of a menu that focus on Bengali and parts of Punjabi cuisine. I have been there a few times now and have taken my international friends and have never come back disappointed. The food is authentic and there is enough variety for vegetarians also. I love their "Radhabollobhi" with "√É¬§lu dum". Simply phenomenal and reminded me of my aunt's cooking in Kolkata. The service is good though when the restaurant gets crowded, it does get slow. Also the restaurant is relatively small size so I suggest that one book a table in advance especially if you plan to head there during peak hours 7 pm - 9 pm. For Singapore times, it stays open till decent hours. Worth a visit definitely
5
Radhika and Mateen were wonderful in helping me plan a dinner for a friend's birthday at Mustard on Saturday night, they were amazingly accommodating, allowing me to bring a cake and decorations and were happy to accommodate extra guests at last minute. The food as always was absolutely delicious, still the best Indian food I have tried in Singapore - and excellent value. At the end of the meal they even gave my friend a bottle of wine to say happy birthday. Try it - you won't be disappointed
5
I tried almost all the Bengali dishes and most of Punjabi dishes in Mustard and find all of them excellent. The smell, taste, texture of food and service, ambiance of Mustard always makes it a superlative experience.As less number of people serve, sometimes, it takes some time to deliver the food, otherwise there are no other glitches.Fantastic food and can be considered as a fine dining
5
Based on TA reviews tried the mustard and loved every mouthful. Food was tasty, flavousome, balanced and in short delicious.Must try is the slow cooked, melt in your mouth, mutton. Six of us ate here ($ 192 SG ) and ordered a variety of dishes including one not on the menu which was prepared without fuss ( Saag Aloo). Six of us left feeling we had hit the jackpot.Dustoff 7
5
In addition to the welcoming and friendly service, Mustard's menu is from a Bengali dream.The flavors and balance of the chef's plates are spot-on. From the minty papadum sauce to the coconut shrimp (served in the whole coconut), to the extra-strong Kingfisher beers, Mustard nails it all. The flavors will haunt you afterwards and will bring you right back here. Believe me
5
Recently visited this restaurant and would reccommend it to anyone visiting Singapore. Lovely welcome when we arrived, perfect service throughout the meal and such lovely tasty Indian food.Had prawn mussala and my husband had Pungabi curry, both dishes served with saffron rice- delicious. We also had a tomato, onion and yoghurt dish which again was very tasty.Would definately go back
5
We popped in around 7:30 last Friday night and were lucky to get the last table. Everything we ordered was beautifully cooked. Mustard had efficient and friendly waiters, and we will definitely be back.
4
If you are a Bengali and want to experience the Bong flavours...this one comes very close...the Ilisher Patori is awesome...
5
last nite,my family had been to mustard on race course road.bengali food was always my favourite,and to have it at singapore was just unthinkable.the fare Kosher mago,the luchi,the rohu fish all was just lipsmacking and the vegetarian fare was also very good.highly recommended for people who are homesick and wanting to eat Indian fare at an alien land.the ambience was good.the service good
4
Craving for bengalee food in Singapore, we decided to check this place out. In India in comparison to an O Calcutta or 6 Ballygunge place may make the restaurant a poor wanna be, this on Singapore was a damn neat effort. Prices were manageable and we had a damn good tim
3
Only place for East Indian Cuisine, the place is cosy but friendly with a nice ambiance. What impressed us most was the personalised service. Food however wasn't the best - the malpua we had for dessert tasted microwaved and rubbery.Although the prices are probably on par with other Indian restaurants, they were high for the standard and quantity of food received.We were excited about trying this place but may not go back for the food

Mustard specializes in cuisine from Bengal. If you want to try food from a region of India not available at standard Indian restaurants, try Mustard. Bengal is famous for their fish dishes, especially the piquant mustard curries.They do serve the standard North Indian fare, but there are better restaurants if you want to have kadhai chicken and biryani. The dishes to try are luchis (puffed bread), chholar daal, their mustard fish curries and the kosha mutton (which is mutton cooked in low heat). Dont miss the dessert of paatishaptas and maalpuwas. This is made in Bengali homes on festive occasions and is never found in north Indian or south Indian restaurants.I don't rate it as excellent only because the portion sizes are rather small for the price. If you want a different taste of Indian food, head to Mustard

This used to be our favourite restaurant till recently. Last two trips were disappointing - the food quality swings to extremes. I was quite embarrassed to host a friend from USA after having sold him the exquisiteness of the place. The mutton kassa was sub-par. Having said that, the starters and desert quality is still quite good, though I would not return to the place for main course soon

Had a nice lunch at this Bengal/ Punjab restaurant. The restaurant was fairly empty, the owner explained that they were not so busy at lunch because their meals were not pre-cooked and hence took a bit longer.The setting on race course road was of course in between all of the indian restaurants. Inside the place looks well maintained and nice. The person who served us was very friendly and competent. The place was not as messy as the touristic banana leaf joints which i personally think are offering bad food & bad service.We ordered a mutton curry, and a butter chicken. The meat of both was tender and juicy. Loved it. The butter naan was fresh and looked home made. I ordered a mango panna - which was better then most of the pannas i had before.The bill was not to terrible - so all in all a good experience.Will definitely come back

I'm not sure why this place was so busy on the Monday night we visited. The decor was as you'd expect for a nice Indian restaurant, but the food very ordinary, using cheap cuts of meat.Service was ok, but the waiter didn't inform us of the extra charges for boneless chicken (which wasn't indicated on the menu either) or that the "jug" of tiger beer was actually just four cans emptied into a jug rather than being draught.The customers were mostly tourists, so maybe their selling point is the nice decor, clean restaurant and hygiene, rather than the quality of the food.Given the number of Indian restaurants on Race Course Road and the surrounding Little India area, I'd try somewhere else next time

Mustard has become a weekly event for us. Having visited a number of Indian Restaurants in Little India this is by far our favourite. The food here is fantastic, everything is especially cooked to order so it does take a little longer than many of the other Indian restaurants where the food I'd pre-cooked.We have eaten here at least a dozen times now and the food has been outstanding every time.Service is not fast as the restaurant is small so they take the orders in line with kitchen capacity. If you have the time available this is definitely worth it for the truly excellent food.

We are from the U.S. and enjoy great Indian food at home. However, this food was even more flavorful and delicious. The naan was awesome!

the resturant is at bit higher side but have some good bengali delicacies, you can have some good bengali dishes like baturi and beguni in here
place is bit cramped though with average service.

Mustard has some unusual Punjabi and Bengali dishes, but is a little inconsistent. Prawn Malai curry in a coconut is one of my faves.

Those of us who enjoy indian food know that its a tall order to get the right balance and combination of spices to make the murg tikka masala or a hyderabadi biryani taste like in "Bukhara" at Maurya Sheraton. Thankfully, there is a restaurant in Singapore that is able to consistently create the right taste that I thoroughly enjoy. On a number of occasions I have tasted the keema matter, a bengali style maacher curry and Calcutta style biryani.And I keep coming back to Mustard to enjoy the refined taste of indian food. After each meal I feel "Dil Khush Ho Gaya" Thank you, Mustard

Pros - Probably the only (or one of the very few) places in Singapore to serve Calcutta cuisineCons - Delay in serving foodBiryani (even though named 'Kolkata Biryani') was not prepared the way it's done in Cal (like, fried onion toppings were used, which didn't really go well with the taste)Portions served did not match up to the cos

This is an unassuming, modest restaurant on Race Course Road in Little India. It provides honest, tasty food on a consistent basis (across all the times we have eaten there or taken friends to eat there).For Friday / Saturday nights it is worth making a reservation, as they have something like 10 tables and get full very quickly.We continue to return as we are sure of the quality and always welcomed with a smile

This is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Singapore. Everything was delicious with just the right amount of spice. Food was not too oily either. The atmosphere is casual, but still pleasant. Service was very good and efficient. The restaurant is easy to access by the Little India MRT

Food: From a price perspective, incredibly good value (I usually land somewhere between $40 and $50/ per person excluding drinks). From a taste perspective, incredible. This is my favourite Indian restaurant in Singapore of any price range and based purely on food these guys can go head-to-head any day with the likes of Rang Mahal, Song of India, Yantra or Jiggs at MBS. Highlights: Prawn curry served in coconut; eggplant curry, ochra curry and the lamb patties. I love Indian food (but am by no means an expert because of the sheer variety of food from different regions/locales in India) and this seems to be spot on every time. Perhaps a better endorsement is that all of my Indian friends (who see all manner of shortcomings it "high end" Indian restaurants like Rang Mahal, Song of India, Yantra and Jiggs) all whole-heartedly love this place without exception.Service: Sharp and attentive. When the restaurant is totally full and you are the last table to get your order in, the waiting time can be up to 30min. This has only happened to me once (and obviously is an issue with every restaurant, not just this one) and they do a pretty good job of keeping orders moving.Ambiance: Casual dining. Located in Little India which is an interesting part of town (especially on Sunday's)

Mustard is the best and probably the only place in Singapore for decent Bengali food. They have an extensive menu for both vegetarians and carnivores. The food is always very fresh and not very oily or creamy as can be the case with many Indian restaurants in Singapore. Must try's are the kolkata singhada, cholar dal with alu jhurjhuri bhaja, alur dum, koshar mangsho. The kebabs and biryanis are also quite good. The service is extremely friendly and the food is adaptable to your tastes upon request. Overall, very good food, decent value, friendly service keeps us going back to Mustard.

I happened to visit this place twice now. Its been a fabulous experience. Good food, very nice taste and nice service. Although a bit pricey but then good indian food in singapore is always like that. The main point was that the taste was authentic and genuine. no mixing of local flavors.Also right beside the Little India MRT so not difficult to get to. I am so happy that I tried this place and have not been disappointed
