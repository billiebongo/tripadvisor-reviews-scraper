Was there on a weekday afternoon around 1pm+. Surprisingly not long queue. The coffee shop was cooling enough, thanks to the many ceiling fans.
The broth was good, prawns were fresh. Reasonably priced.

I was invited to lunch by a friend at this restaurant. From the outside this restaurant looks like many small restaurants in Singapore. But, the food is excellent. If you go for lunch, arrive early or you won't find a seat.

I love how they serve slices prawns because not many prawn mee parlors do that. Portion is good for the price. The yellow noodle is a little bit mushy, so quickly eat them up before it gets soggy.

My Singaporean colleague invited me to have traditional Chinese lunch. We had noodle soup with prawns. Very tasty, but place is little bit cloudy and messy.

We went to this place after walking along Haji Lane in the Arab district. The place looks humble but fairly busy even before lunch time. We ordered the Jumbo Prawn Noodles and it was really delicious. The prawns were big and fresh. The broth was full of flavour. It was also a reasonable price.

Was tempted to try the Jumbo Prawn Noodles 珍宝虾面 (option 2; $8.80/$10.80), but at almost double the price & it being my first time here, I opted for the simpler "normal" Prawn Noodles 虾面 (option 7; $4.80/5.80) bowl-- large sized, of course.The ratio of prawns to noodles are pretty off. I had so much noodles remaining (#carbloading) but I guess it was okay because they were good non-soggy noodles. Soup was delicious too. After you place your order, your food gets delivered to you, so be sure to have your table number ready when you order at the counter.They also serve options with pork ribs & /or pig tails, but that's not my kind of thing. Full on prawns for me! Will try the Jumbo Prawn Noodles next time

Located near the eclectic Arab district of Singapore, Blanco Court starts to get packed around noon as lunch customers show up. The prawns are big and fresh, while the broth is simple and flavourful. I just wish it could be a big greasy and not as austere. A medium size bowl costs $8.80, not cheap even for a good one like Blanco

Was having a business discussion somewhere this area and I didn't know about this famous place. I was walking around and thought to take my lunch in this coffeeshop. There is no queue at all and I ordered their pork rib and prawn noodles. Dish arrive within a minute and the soup taste is so sweet and good. While indulging on this super good good I notice that suddenly the queue became very long. That's when I came to know this coffeeshop is actually a famous one. Lucky me doesn't have to queue.

Great authentic Prawn Mee. Chose the jumbo Prawn option at $10.80.Soup had great flavor to it.You are able to buy drinks such as water, iced coffee or tea in another stall beside the Mee stall.Would also recommend grabbing some of the spring rolls / sausages / century egg etc as a side snack with nodded from the stall next door

This is an old FAVOURITE place my mind to get my prawn mee fix. Soup - flavourful every mouthful! Prawn - fresh but I thought last time used to be bigger?!?Pork ribs - very tasty that even my kids endorse !I always end up buying the big portions because the wait is SO long! But it's super worth it I promised

Nice stop after our Haji Lane visit. Prawn mee was delicious. Can chose yellow thick noodles, white vermicelli noodle or a mix. Generous prawns amount for the price. Also ordered a homemade barley drink after :)

Costing an average of $5 per bowl, this average dish is overpriced with little portion. The stall assistant even cleared my unfinished food when I just left the table for a while to replenish my soup because they always serves it only 1/3 full.

This is another one of the good Prawn Noodle soup in Singapore. Though not the best, but it's good enough to eat here if you are nearby

Came here with some friends to try the prawn noodle. We order the pork rib and prawn dry noodle. Chili was good as it added flavor to the dry noodle. We like the soup and it can be refill.

Happy to see the crowd during lunch. Food was on the salty side which encourages you to drink more lime juice. Portions small for the price. Prawns are not fresh sometimes.

BeachRoadとOphirRoadの交差点からArabStreetの方へ少し歩いたところにあるプロウンヌードル（海老出汁の利いたラーメン）屋がある。
めぼしい観光スポットが近くに無いので寄る機会はあまり無いかもしれないが、海老麺にやみつきの魅力を感じた方であれば行く価値はある。
自分はオフィスが近いので、よく同僚と通っています。
ランチ時ともなれば、周囲のオフィスから吐出されてきたワーカーが長蛇の列を作り、海老の出汁と醤油がよくマッチした海老麺を啜っている。
オーダーの仕方は慣れないと少しむずかしい。まごまごしていると、行列が伸びてプレッシャーがかかるので、以下の要領で頼むと良い。
１．行列に並ぶ前にテーブルを確保する（重要）
オーダー後に海老麺が運ばれてくる仕組みなので、最初にテーブルを確保し、テーブルの端に書かれたナンバーを覚えておくこと。レジでは最初に「テーブルNo.●」と伝える。テーブルを確保しないと最悪麺が運ばれてこない上に、運ぶ係の人が非常に困惑するので必ず確保してから列に並ぶこと。確保したテーブルにはハンカチなどを置いて確保済であることを示すこと。
２．頼む料理の種類を選ぶ
海老麺、海老の代わりに豚肉が入った麺、海老と豚肉が混ざった麺など８種類くらいの料理が選べる。レジの上に番号付きで写真が掲載されているので、そこから選ぶ。
普通盛りと大盛りで１ドル違う。普通盛りなら「No.●, small one」、大盛りなら「No.●, Bigger one」とレジ係に伝える。
※50セントプラスで「野菜マシ（=extra vegi）」「もやしマシ（=extra sprout）」「麺マシ（=extra noodle）」といったコールができるが、コールが複雑化するので、初めての方にはオススメしない。
３．麺の種類を選ぶ
麺の種類を聞かれるので、黄色の卵麺、白い麺、ビーフンがあるので好きなモノを選ぶ。黄色麺なら「Yellow one」、白い麺なら「white one」、ビーフンなら「ビーフン」でOK。黄色と白を混ぜる「Mix」が使えるようになると常連である。
４．スープ/ドライの選択
「Dry?Soup?」と聞かれるので、汁なし麺（油そばのイメージに近い）か汁ありかを選ぶ。汁なしなら「Dry」、汁ありなら「Soup」と伝える。
５．辛さの選択
「Chili?」と聞かれる。唐辛子エキスで辛くしてもらいたければ「Yes, Chili」。辛くしたくないなら「No,Thanks」。
６．支払い
普通は4.8ドル、大盛りは5.8ドルと良心的な価格。なるべく小額紙幣で支払おう。
７．テーブルで待機
オーダーを受けてる途中から調理は始まっており、確保しておいたテーブルに戻ってから５分程度で着丼する。
８．堪能する
強い海老の旨味と、スープタイプであれば日本人好みの醤油ベースの辛さが混ざった美味しい一杯を堪能できるはず。辛さが足りない場合は、卓上の醤油、唐辛子、胡椒で味付けする。
同じ店舗内にある醸豆腐（おでんのようなもの）も合わせて食べるとボリュームも十分で大いに満足できるはず。

Long queue during lunch time followed by long wait for the noodle after ordering. The noodle portion was small considering the rather high price. Taste was average though the soup was rather tasty. Can't say I see what the fuss is all about this place.
4
We ordered the $10.80 jumbo prawn mee that comes with soup. The stock is rich and the prawns are big and with roe... While waiting for our order, we also ordered the fried wu xiang which complement the prawn mee. Overall I like the prawn mee and will definitely be back again

I had breakfast here for two days straight, both time having prawn noodles and Teh C (tea with evaporated milk). I didn't know it was famous until a local friend told me so. It was a good experience, the food is simple, the tea is good. The noodles was cooked to a nice texture and the prawns are fresh. The staff there was particularly nice too. Bear in mind, like a lot of the local restaurant, this one has no air-con, but they have fans. If you sit near to the exit, it's less stuffy. Good for light food during the day

This place sells the best prawn mee in singapore to me. The broth is rich and flavourful without MSG, the prawns are fresh and the chilli powder/cut chilli goes really well with the dish. Order the Ngoh Hiang from the adjacent store too, it has a good variety of ngoh hiang for you to choose from. But the main attraction is still the prawn mee!! However waiting queue can be very long and time consuming. Be ready with your table number before you order at the counter
