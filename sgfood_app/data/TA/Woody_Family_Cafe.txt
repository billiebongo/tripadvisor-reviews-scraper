Came here after a golf game. Open till midnight. Food is not bad but a bit spicy for me. Order chap chye, omelette, petal prawn, top shell and a lamb spicy dish. The location is a quite far inside. It's located in a neighborhood.

Spicy and tasty food offered, great selection of alcoholic beverages. The sambal petai is a must try!

Always love to visit this place as it's cozy and homely. The food is lovely too. Too many of my favorites to be listed here. The owners are very friendly as well. Always try to accommodate our requests.

We order their fried rice and satay. The food not very special but taste not bad. Good ambience and service staff quite attentive.

Have been here a few times, and I must say that the food has never disappointed me. The portion of onion rings is very generous, and so is that of the fries served alongside their burgers. Their Mama Laksa burger is quite interesting, and definitely manageable for people who cannot take food that is too spicy. The best dish I have tried would be the Beef Rendang, which is actually not as spicy as one would imagine... It's a wonderful treat for people who like meat, and the peranakan cuisine, since the style of cooking was inspired by that. Their range of desserts may not be as wide as other food joints, but each portion is made with love and brings warmth to any person's tummy

Not much publicity is done for this urban family restaurant. We chanced upon it when one the pictured dishes appeared in the papers (national favourites competition of some sort). Anyhow, the nasi ulam is surpassed by none in Singapore (except mine, ahem!). The dishes are authentic and individually made nyonya / Peranakan food. There is a lot of choices beyond nyonya food, and they have a decent spread of beer and spirits. Look up the menu on Facebook yourself, but I'm not sure you'll get anything as homey and personal with the cooks interacting with you. Ask for the recommendations, and call ahead to ask. We always have the nasi ulam, chap chai, anything with petai (fried rice or the ikan bilis), the beef rendang, and... the sambal is made by themselves (spicy, and full of flavour!). The list goes on, but you need to decide if you're doing Peranakan or mixing with the Western menu... (too little stomach space). Hence, we always take away spares... till the next time

Woody's Family Cafe is a out at the way place located near Sembawang Park. To sum, its like a time capsule that you can enter and sit for a while.The place has a messy chaotic rustic charm that seems to work for it. The dining area is a kalaidesope of colours, lights and retro collections that kept my eyes busy. The furnishing is a mix of sofas, benches, and stools giving off a homely feel. The owners obviously like listening to Oldies as popular songs from that time were the ambient music.The food choices there are Western, Peranakan and Fusion. I personally think there were too many types of Starters and Mains that I wondered if they have everything available. Food wise is a hit or miss. I'd give them 8/10 for plating as you can see from the pictures. Taste of the food however varies. The mama laksa burger is really excellent and juicy. In contrast, the chicken burger lacks flavor and was bland.The place is suitable for family, gatherings and couples looking interesting places

This restaurant tries too hard with the fusion theme. Instead of allowing us to order in what we wanted, the manager wouldn't listen and was exceptionally pushy, trying to get us to try what was on special. The food was quite expensive and nothing special. The hamburger I had did not have a firm patty. It was more like a loose, sloppy mixture. There are limited healthy options.

The location is awesome, private and serving good variety of food. Portion is big with no compromise of taste given of the price, couldn't ask for more. Understand owner (wife) love to cook, that relates me of the goof food served. Good variety of deserts and few wine promotions (30% on Monday & Wednesday). The ambience is very home based decorated and something very unique and chilled. Staff was proactive and the whole experience was a fantastic one

We had visited a friend in the vicinity and decided to try Woody FamilyCafe since it was just a few steps away. Had a great time there and enjoyed the food. Woody's serves fusion Peranakan and Western food and it is a nice change. Our friend ordered the spaghetti with prawns but she felt it was nothing special. Hubby had the fusion Western Guinness battered fish and chips and enjoyed it. I had the Fusion Peranakan Lamb Shank rendang with loaf which I enjoyed as the rendang was thick and spicy and the loaf was crispy on the outside and soft and light on the inside.However be warned that the latter two dishes were huge, just like portions in the US and it could have been enough for two to share. We also ordered the signature buffalo wings, opting for the spicy version. Nicely marinated, the spicy version is not for the faint hearted. Depending on your tolerance level, you can opt for the very mild to the towering inferno options in terms of spiciness. They also serve sets as well which would give better value for money.Overall an interesting place to dine with a cozy ambience. Do note that your mobile phone signal might at times switch to Malaysian signal, so do check or you might just end up with some roaming charges.
