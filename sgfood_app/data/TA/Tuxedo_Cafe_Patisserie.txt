Had a very nice cappuccino while waiting for a meeting to start. 2 other Australian colleagues share the same view. Definitely a quite place for a meeting or alone time if you’re in the vicinity.

Located in Carlton Hotel, Bras Basah. I love the ambience. It is quiet, you may sit and enjoy a cup of tea or coffee or simply work with your laptop. Staffs are kind and helpful. The seafood pie is the best tho! Worth to try.

If you jsut want something light and quick this is a good place to go. Nothing heavy but the choices will satisfy a hungry stomach.

My boyfriend and I decided to go to Tuxedo to sample the lovely cakes they had on show and the creative lattes. Unfortunately all the things they said that was on offer..simply wasn’t, never even had a pan au chocolate. Ended up having a plain tea/coffee and a plain croissant.One of the servers..although friendly, didn’t speak good English so was hard to communicate and the other server had to come over.Disappointing...we won’t be back when in Singapore agai

Our group of 4 each ordered a coffee, espresso, latte and cappuccino. While on the pricy side this was great coffee. As we are all from Melbourne and a bit special when it comes to a good cuppa I would recommend this as a place to get your coffee fix in Singapore.

Other reviews have already noted that prices are on the high side but the shockingly rude service is quite something else. We went there for afternoon tea and ordered a few pastries. On the board was an offer for coffee with the waffles for an extra $3. I went for that. My receipt showed a $5 charge for the coffee so I went back to the counter to clarify. The cafe wasn't busy at all and nothing in my tone of voice or my demeanor suggested irritation. It really was an innocent question - why was I being charged $5 for coffee when the board said $3?So I was shocked when the server (her name tag identified her as 'May') reacted to my query with a scowl. She picked up the phone and started ranting to someone on the other end (a colleague, I suppose). I stood there waiting for her to finish and even asked her if I should sit back at my table to wait for her to get back to me. No response from her. Instead, more ranting over the phone. She even started slamming some items around her (plates, cutlery) to show her displeasure. After a few excruciating minutes, another staff member appeared. Yvonne explained that the difference was due to the fact that the price of the waffles as reflected in the receipt was lower than what it was on the board. So taken together, there was no price difference for the waffle/coffee set. A simple explanation that should have been given from the start. When I pointed out her colleague's bizarre and unprofessional behaviour, all I got from Yvonne was a feeble apology and a "rest assured, the waffles taste great". I'm not sure I agree - the dollop of insolence and disrespect served with the waffles was hard to swallow

Stayed in Carlton Hotel and accidentally found this cafe. I wanted a simple breakfast but I was too lazy to go out the hotel. Decided to tried Tuxedo and it was good. I never expect good coffee from cafes in hotel. This cafe have some good drinks and pastries. Glad I have stumbled across this cafe

We went 2 mornings running for a large coffee and pastry SGD10. The coffee shop is just off the lobby of the Carlton city hotel and is bright and comfortable. The young lady serving was delightful and this was some of the best coffee we have had with fresh pastries. For the size of the coffee we thought it was good value

$8 for a cup of plain black coffee? I've never been so ripped off. This is twice what the price of this should be! I will never go back.

Each morning got a great flat white and croissant for breakfast. Delicious. Also had a sandwich here which was also delicious alond with there cakes. Service was very friendly and quick.
5
I was staying at the Carlton Hotel so this was a convenient spot to get my daily latte. The quality of the coffee was excellent (so much better than Starbuck's, say), and the pastries were lovely too.
4
We tried a couple of cakes here and they were delicious. The variety of freshly made bakery items and cakes was really great.
5
We sometimes preferred to have breakfast here than to go out.
The cakes as well as the coffee are delicious.

Located at the lobby of the hotel, it's a convenient place if you want to grab some decent coffee and cake to fill your stomach. They have 50% discount off their pastries at night so do come and grab them!
5
Quiet and relaxing with a superb collection of different cakes and pastries and very good coffee. Totally relaxing place to go to for a coffee.
5
Best coffee and pastries made in-house. Perfect treat after the office each day. I can highly recommend the Pain Au Chocolat
3
Food was on the pricey side but the location and comfortable ambience help. Quiet place to chill and there's a couch plus quick wifi. Food-wise, taste was just average but good presentation and pleasant service.
4
Rather than the hotel buffet upstairs that doesn't offer much food, this place is much nicer to come for breakfast with its hipper version of sandwiches and coffee. relatively quiet and suitable for breakfast alone or for a small business meeting - if you don't mind that people from the lobby can see yo

I love the cakes there. Very good service and very attentive staff. I had some nice tea pots during my stay at the hotel

Loved this little cafe. I thought it was excellent value for a cuppa and sandwich or cake. Definitely would recommend it.
3
Service was a bit slow (but very thorough), but the quality was great and staff friendly great for a morning or afternoon tea, well anytime really if you like sweet things like waffles.
5
I can't rave about this place enough. The customer service is fantastic, coffee wonderful and the pastries delicious. I look forward to one of Taki's perfectly poured coffees every morning - not to mention the fancy patterns!
5
Lovely pastries, and very friendly staff. Nice place to relax beside the lobby. The croissants are some of the best I've ever seen. Small but exquisite selection.
4
Coffee was $9 dollars and took a while to get when I looked at the barista she was having a coffee herself(that is why mine is taking so long) but the raspberry croissant was absolutely delicious and I wanted another(I did resist).
4
The service here is good, and the food very decent. It's appropriate for casual business meetings or if you want to do some work on your laptop.
5
This patisserie serves beautiful cakes and pastries, which are really fresh and relish! The service is efficient and friendly too. We had many a cup of tea/cappuccino and cake there!

Tuxedo Cafe is a loving tribute to European coffeehouse culture, embodying definitive style and elegance. The immaculate decor complete with glossy floorboards and black-bowed chairs, brings out the touch of class in utterly comfortable settings tended by a service crew that brings service up to top notch.We started with a Quiche (SGD$6.00) filled with mushrooms and cheese, with an incredible crust that was solid and soft at the same time, retaining a lovely buttery flavour so it held its own perfectly well. Each bite held a subtle crunch to it, connecting well with the smooth custard-like texture of the cheese.The Mini Cakes (SGD$2.50 for 3 pieces) were too tempting and affordable to resist, so we succumbed, selecting a trio to try - namely the Chocolate one, the Chocolate Truffle one and the Cheesecake one. Don't underestimate the power of these small cake minions - their allure is by lingering in the mouths deliciously after you get over their soft, velvety sweet flavours, so that you keep yearning to go back for more, or wishing they'd come in regular slices.Following that, we had some very fluffy Waffles by the name of "Strawberry Shortcake" (SGD$15.00), an excellent recommendation by the lady who tended to us. Upon taking the first bite, we knew what they meant by watching out for the "texture" when we commented on its beauty. The waffles were extremely fluffy! - so light and crispy and melty, literal food-falls treading upon the tongue like a dance. The pairing of cream and raspberry ice-cream completed this dessert perfectly. We were wowed, that's all I could say.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/06/afternoon-tea-at-tuxedo-cafe-carlton.htm

Good coffee is not a given in Singapore so I was pretty happy that my hotel could provide me with some! The coffee was great but with a hefty price tag. However, a good investment in each day. I was encouraged to try their 'Signature' mini chicken pie which is apparently one of the top 10 in Singapore - was not sorry I indulged, it was fabulous.
