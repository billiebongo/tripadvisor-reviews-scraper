Outstanding collection including many old, open bottles. Brilliant service and atmosphere and the possibility of a half measure to be able to taste that which would otherwise be inaccessible. Love it.
5
Conveniently located in city center, the bar is a little hidden in the Rendez vous hotel. Impressive selection whiskey and other fine liquors with stylish sofa and great services. 100% recommend for a business drink
5
I was recommended by fellow whisky affectionados to visit the Auld Alliance. I thank them for it. Tbis place is it. The library I would say. Great collection the people have knowledge about what they serve. I would recommend this place. Will be back soon.
5
After reading reviews about this place, we stopped in for a tasting. The staff were friendly and definitely knowledgeable about all things whiskey. It was an added bonus that we could have food delivered, so that we could stay and enjoy our drinks for a bit longer. If you are into good whiskey and conversation, definitely would recommend
5
This place is actually a must-do for every Whiskey lover who visits Singapore. Great selection of Japanese whiskeys. They told me that they are proud of their selection of more than 1500 bottles from all over the World. The lowest priced drams would be the top end of many other whiskey bars in Europe, e.g. Hibiki 19 years. :-) Easy to get to, there are three MRT stations close to it (Bencoolen, Dhoby Ghaut and Bras Basah)
5
If you like single malts, this is the place for you. The variety of malts is simply amazing. They also get in a regular supply of hard to get or rare malts that you can enjoy. The seating, leather chairs and sofas, is very comfortable. Service is usually quite good.The only drawback is that Auld Alliance is not exactly affordable. You can run up a hefty bill without realising it.But if malts are your thing, then don't miss Auld Alliance.
5
This bar is amazing, soooooo many bottles and variety is endless (well almost). A treat was a pre-prohibition whiskey from 1863! (Photo), Japanese selection incredible. Staff are so helpful, knowledgeable and provide wonderful service. One problem is what my own whiskey collection at home doesn't seem so great now haha, too good love this place, you must go and try some of their super rare bottles
5
This was on our to-do list and it didn't disappoint. It's a cool, quiet oasis for whiskey/spirit lovers. Try the tasting sets if you don't know which of the thousands of whiskeys you want to try. Or sample a cognac, absinthe, or bourbon. Even the beer was fantastic. The staff are attentive and knowledgeable, the couches are comfy, and the environment is charming. We went twice in 2 days, and would happily go more regularly if we lived in Singapore
5
A classic Scotch Bar from the overstuffed leather chairs to the amazing selection of scotch and even some bourbons. Whatever your tastes The Auld Alliance will have it just make your selection from the "Scotch Bible". I saw no less than five attendants waiting to serve you I felt like royalty. Definitely will stop in again on my next trip to Singapor
5
Amazing whisk(e)y line up, ordered, sorted, categorised by distillery, vintage, age. Bring a mate or two, pick a nice spot, take your time to pick a selection and appreciate the bestowed liquid gold. The independent bottles are equally as good as own bottles and similarly, Auld Alliance also have their own bottles for sampling. Have a chat to Natasha or Emmanuel for good insightful discussion on all things whiskies
5
Amazing choice of whiskey. Some Rhum, Cognac, Armagnac. Smallest choice in Wine but here it is more for those that don t want to have a whiskey !
4
Recommended to try their whisky flight as they got a good range, love their leather sofa and the classy feel. Beside Manhattan bar at regent hotel , not many places ooze classy in that sense.
5
I have been to whisky bar all over the world in major cities and this one definitely ranks in the top 5. If you are in Singapore it's worth a visit and easy to find.
5
Most impressive! Wall to wall scotch whisky from all over the world - possibly the largest collection I've ever seen. Great ambience.
5
This is one of the top 5 whiskey bars in Singapore. It's absolutely amazing!! with millions of bottles to choose! OMG! The 17 years old Laphroaig by The whisky agency is so addictive! The smell is beyond words ! Big love! The real whiskey should taste like this! Also the place is so relaxing ! Very very very good ! Definitely will come here often 
5
This place is heaven for scotch lovers! I have never seen such a vast collections of single malts under one roof. I was overwhelmed as soon as I entered the place. The menu is detailed and has good amount of information for the geekier souls - me! The bartenders/staff members are very knowledgeable and will help you decide the scotch you want to try - a daunting task, since the collection is huge. The bartenders are very friendly, and will come and personally explain things to you and will gladly answer all your questions. The place itself has a really suave and gentlemanly feel to it. I spent 2 hours sitting and sipping my drink(s), and exploring the menu to make mental notes of the drinks I want to try next time.The pricing is a little steep - I will just mention this as an informative point for readers. This point is not, and should not be, a deterrent to people who wanted to enjoy good alcohol. I found the place to be more than my money's worth. Had I not been on a budget - I was backpacking, or had I visited this place on the first few days of my trip - I went on the last night, I would have definitely tried more whiskys. It's a must visit place for anyone who wants a good whisky!I would love to open this place in India! The owner of The Auld Alliance, if you are reading this then please let's get in touch and try to make it happen. Cheers! :
4
This place is something like a dream for anyone that loves whisky. It is stocked from floor to ceiling with the largest selection I have ever seen in one place. I enjoyed a good few drinks here after dinner and I even found a few rare Japanese whiskies that I have been searching for so I was very impressed. The only thing I would improve would be to use good big clear ice cubes for the highball rather than the small ones.
5
I went for a by chance late night drink What a gem a stunning array of single malts from all over the world with a selection of brandies, cognac's and absynthe truly a delight next time there again but and there is always a but very expensive even by western standards A bottle I buy in the west for $sing 110 was listed at $sing 34
5
When you get in and start to look around it is absolutely hard to believe what you see. One legendary bottle next to the other and even if you thought you have seen them all they will surprise you with stunning stuff never even heard of. This is not whisky heaven, it's to unrealistic for that. And the staff knows it all and Emanuel Dron, Ower of the place is so unpretentious and lovely! Can't wait to go back
4
Superb place that has almost every well known brand of single and blended malts. Also has a collection of famous whiskeys from across the world. The place has a private room as well that can be hired but for a minimum spend of about 1000 sgd or so.
4
Whisky fanatics will have a ball in this place. Ambiance is pretty cool, although the music needs a little work.
5
Wow! What an amazing collection of whisky. This is a must for whisky lovers. There is something for everyone in both price range and whisky.
The staff are friendly and very knowledgable.
Next visit to Singapore will include an evening here.
5
Friendly staff, impressive collection of whiskeys and rhum.
A place to stop by for a drink when in Singapore
5
Not a whiskey drinker but friends who love whiskey claim that this is one of the best whiskey bars they've been to! The selection is astounding and you will be spoilt for choice! The place is nice and unassuming with great service.
5
Unlimited choices of whiskey !! The collection which they have is just massive. I can't believe they have this kind of place in Singapore. Definitely a must try for all whiskey lovers. The location is quite centralized as well, it is on top of Rendezvous Hotel at the city area. Even if you drink too much, it is relatively easy to find a taxi or take other means of public transport from there to your home.The price is relatively on the high side. But with this kind of quality, I don't mind paying a little bit more to enjoy rare collections of Whiskey which you can't possibly find anywhere else
5
This is a wonderfully stocked whisky bar with everything whisky lovers could ask for .if you can't find it here, you ll find it nowhere. The downside...... The location inside the shopping mall of the Rendezvous hotel.this place is deserving of a much better location and surroundings.
4
took my husband here for his birthday and he ordered a tasting flight. unfortunately no one really explained the experience, which was a disappointment. but he was thrilled with the collection. i ordered a glass of wine, which was pretty bad, but i guess you cant expect good wine in a whiskey ba
5
After seeing the reviews on trip advisor we wanted to try the food and some drink. We met 2 friends for dinner and was not disappointed everybody enjoyed there food and whisky at the end, Nice touch. It's not cheap but you pay for great service, food and drink. Good going. Fantastic
5
Words have simply failed me , I have not had the pleasure of being exposed to such an amazing selection or collection of whisky before............absolute heaven .The Staff are knowledgable and friendly , the atmosphere is calm ( a nice break from the frenetic Singapore I love) and Arun the manager was brilliant , I got a personal tour of the bar . Brilliant 
4
A work colleague knew of this place and knowing I like the odd dram or two took me along to check it our. With the appearance of gentleman's club and the almost solemn feel of a shrine, this place is relaxing, educational almost and a definite must visit place. The staff know their stuff and if you know what you like but want to try something different, they will advise you and they usually get their recommendations spot on
5
Whisky list to die for, well done, seen nothing much better anywhere, good staff, might be a wee bit expensive however with that list it might be worth it, no everything is available by the dram however a good enough selection
4
Amazing whisky collection. A huge number available by the glass and well worth a visit. Unfortunately seating is quite limited and could be better designed.
4
Went just for drinks on a friends strong recommendation. And enjoyed thoroughly everything was amzing about this place the moment you step in you will realise it.
5
They have an absolutely amazing selection of whiskys from all over the world. I really enjoyed their tasting menus.Once you are finally in the bar it feels immediately like you have entered whisky heaven - the wooden interior, the leather couches - everything is set for enjoying a great whiskey. And i am sure they'll have one right for your taste and wallet
5
What a place for whisky lovers and my husband is one of them. He thought he had landed in heaven. We went to this bar twice in a 2 day visit to Singapore and loved it. Absolutely huge selection of whiskies and extremely knowledgeable and friendly staff and as I personally am not a whisky fan, the red wine available is pretty good - go there - its worth it
5
It's easy: if you like whisky, you'll love The Auld Alliance. It's a bit of a strange location within the Rendezvous Hotel, but the place is a must do for every whisky lover. Many rare bottles and the guy in charge is a walking whisky encyclopedia. Top choice.
5
Situated within the confines of the Rendevous hotel. This hidden gem. Too much whiskey to mention. Helpful staff guide you through your individual taste. We wanted to put the Japanese against the Scottish. The staff assisted in this as we went away from the set menu. We chose two Scottish and one Japanese being the Yamazaki. (All sherry barrelled). Really good contrasting tastes. Staff continually topped up our water glasses and the free nuts added to the flavour. The Chesterfield seats complimented the ambiance. It was so good we came back a second time opting for the Hendricks and Tonic. It came out in huge glasses and was just what was needed after a long day of sightseeing. Would highly recommend a visit it's not cheap but neither is drinking in Singapore
5
My first visit to this place and we came from the Long Bar after enjoying 18-year single malt Macallans. AA claims to have the 3rd largest selection of SM's in the world. And looking at this place, I would not doubt it. It is amazing to see wall to wall, 3 or 4 rows deep of whisky bottles. The service is very good and it was packed so reservations on w'ends, are a must. They stocked the Yamazaki and it arrived in tulip glasses without the waiter asking stupid questions (as in the Long Bar) and a small pot of natural spring water. We all agreed that the Yamazaki deserved the crown as the best SM. It was spectacular and just on the back of the 18 year Macallans we could very easily make out Yamazakis lead over the rest. It is possibly the most perfectly balanced and smoothest i have come across. I'm hooked. Hic
5
This place is def the best whiskey bar in Sing. They have the perfect combination of great whiskey selection and relaxed yet sophisticated vibe. If you're really into whiskey, this place would be the best location for you to get lost with all its massive selections of rare and old whiskey . For non whiskey lovers? it is the right place for you to start learning about whiskey and its variety. The staffs are very knowledgeable and offer a good service.For the best value, go with their tasting set so you can get to know different types of good whsikey at a very reasonable price. With all of things offered here, this place has simply won my heart as my fave bar in tow
4
Came here with a couple of friends in a weekday night. We managed to find seats easily even though the place was kinda noisy due to two large groups of patrons. This was the 2nd time I was here, the 1st time being when they were still located t CHIJMES. The place had transformed from a quiet bar to one that is noisy and upbeat, possibly due to the closer location to nearby institutes of learning. The whisky menu was still as solid as ever. I will definitely return again just because the number of single malt whisky bars is far and few in Singapore.
3
for non whisky lover, this can be an educational visit.
for whisky lovers, this is your play ground/ toy shop.
5
I liked the tasting packages which are reasonably priced. The place looks great and is perfect to have good and long talks paired with a good scotch.
4
Unbelievable selection of whiskey from around the world. This is not a party place but a nice quiet location to enjoy your favorite whiskey or try one from around the world.
5
Whiskey beer is a treat. The gin tonic is wonderful on a warm Saturday evening. I sincerely hope they manager to bring in more business, would hate to see them fade away.
5
Great place to have a drink and/or dinner. Bar decorations is amazing. Price is reasonable and food is ok.Try to go just before sunset, when the sun almost gone.
5
It was my first time there and my friends and I were graciously accorded the private room by Emmanuel and Nat.When we sauntered in, it was clear as day why this place is undeniably the mecca for whisky/whiskey. Scotch, Irish, Japanese, American, Canadian, whatever your preferred dram, this place has it all. The bar was literally stacked with some fine, and old, nectar. And all around you'll find comfortable seats to unwind and imbibe in a drink or two.But we had a private room waiting, and the room is where we want to be. The entrance to the private room is almost Harry Potter-esque. Tucked behind a nondescript wall is a swinging door that leads you to push-button sliding door. But what's inside is nothing mysterious - comfortable Chesterfield sofas, mood lighting, vintage posters and a tome (or two) on cigars and whiskys, a long table (essential when you having a few bottles, glasses and cigar ashtrays and torches scattered all around), a vantage view of the street below. It is obviously designed with one thing in mind - kick back, and chill with preferred poison.When we finally settled down, we ordered a bottle of Nikka All Malt. As expected that didn't last very long. Soon after a Nikka From The Barrel made its presence. To complement the drink, a few of us also lit up some fine Cuban cigars (which you can purchase on premise though the selection is rather limited).The prices are reasonably priced, the ambience sublime, and the attentive staff who came in very few minutes to check on us, poured water and provided fresh ice balls, certainly made this a worthy place to hang out with friends.Thank you, Emmanuel and Nat.We will be back (hic)
5
Needed a place to meet old friends and the name fitted the bill - however the Auld Alliance tuned out to be a brilliant find. The whisky selection would challenge the Malt Whisky Society in Edinburgh. But the staff make it work, we will be back!
5
Always take my visiting friends and colleagues who appreciate good single malt scotch whisky. Great place to learn and appreciate. Staff are very friendly, totally unpretentious and knowledgeable about not only the characteristics of whisky, but the particular distillery as well. So many whiskies, so little time
5
The venue is not easy to find if you don't know where to go, or you might even have to ask when you reach the Rendezvous hotel near Bras Basah mrt. It's on the 2nd floor of a back area atrium behind the hotel.It looks nondescript from the front, but when you walk in it has great dark wood and leather comfort. Much like the feel of an astute library. And whiskey bottles displayed everywhere.In addition to Scotch, Irish, American, etc., you can also taste the Japanese whiskeys. Don't know where to start? No problem, you can do a tasting of all types, or certain styles (only Speyside), only single malts, only Irish, etc.They don't serve food but if you want to get elsewhere and bring in, they don't mind. And if you have any questions, they are so well-versed on every bottle, you'll be overwhelmed with the knowledge.Great service! Oh, and if you don't like whiskey, you can try sake, or several other options. Despite the upscale feel, they accommodate casual dress
5
We happened up The Auld Alliance by accident, after a dinner nearby. We felt we had hit the proverbial jackpot - I personally have never seen such a huge selection of whiskey. They have whiskey from every imaginable part of the world. They have 1950s Macallan. They also have a cigar room.
4
Excellent selection of Whisky. I'm not a huge whisky fan, but there was plenty to choose from that even I liked. If you don't know which one is your type, try the set tasters. Definitely recommended.
5
After seeing the disappointing selection of bourbons at my hotel I decided to head here and was not disappointed. Very amazing selection of bourbon.
5
The reviews by other contributors really spells alot and I do not have anything more to add except that...If you like YOUR Whiskey...You will LOVE This place!
5
You are certainly spoiled for choice when entering this place. A lot of my dream drams were in attendance, some unopened a lot opened. I would need a month to go through all the drams I dreamed of. But That would also take quite a lot of money. Prices are a little higher than what you would expect elsewhere. But that is the norm for Singapore prices.I hope I will be back. Two visits are not enough!Thank
5
If you love whisky ..this is the place u should camp:) too much whisky dont know which one to start with.Food is good and the people who working there very frenly.. I will give this Bar 95/100 points.. So far still not yet found a bar better den this:
5
We visited while on a short Singapore stopover on the way to elsewhere. It was a little hard to find as it is upstairs in a non-descript hotel complex, but once there it is an attractive and cosy venue.We tried many different whiskeys by the glass on the recommendation of the staff, they asked what style we liked and then tried to match that based on what they had available by the glass. I like the heavily peated style from places like Islay, whereas my wife likes more subtle ones from Speyside. I liked everything I tried but of course the ones I really liked are not available anywhere but at the Auld Allliance - just wshed I lived in SIngapore!One thing to remember is that if you want to try lots of different whiskeys, then it is better to ask for half serves of 2cl instead of 4cl
5
It is not exaggrated to say that Auld Alliance is a paradise of whiskey!!! You can find a variety kinds of whisky all over the world! The bar is very fantastic and fulfilled with amazing music. The staff is very friendly, helpful, attentive to help you choose the most suitable drinks and also very knowledgeable. It is really funny and great to interact with them! Another good thing is the very reasonable price! No doubt if you are a wishky lover, try it if you have a chance
5
Loved it Loved it Loved it - You don't have to like whiskey to have a drink here. I must admit I felt like a real grown up (and not just a 50 year old traveller!!!!) sipping my Auchentoshan whilst my husband was tasting whiskeys from around the world and another friend was having a Hendrick's gin based cocktail. It was like sitting in an Gentleman's club - but without the cigars and women allowed!!!!! If in Singapore again - will be visiting.....They know their stuff....
5
We had an amazing time tasting our way through some of the best that Scotland has to offer in this fabulous whisky bar with the most extensive range of malts I've ever seen. And not at all incongruous that we did it in Singapore with a twenty-something German/American serving us! Relaxed atmosphere, helpful and knowledgeable staff - Marlon clearly has a passion for his subject and his enthusiasm for whisky is infectious. The 21-year-old Glendronach the pick of the bunch, 28-year-old sherry-casked Laphroaig and 11-year-old Longrow not far behind (We gave the $500-a-nip 1946 Macallan a miss though..) Truly excellent and the Auld Alliance is now up there in my list of favourite bars of the world
4
They've got it all - from whisky to whiskey! This is a great place to try stuff you've never had before - or just drink your fave distillation. I normally drink the smoky ones from Scotland but was introduced to some crackers from Japan. And the prices are reasonable too so you can afford to be adventurous.Food not so good - but that is not why this place exists so who cares
5
Best place in Asia for whiskers. Amazing selection. Served with respect
Bar staff have a great knowledge so if you're not sure what to have ask !
4
Went there on a quiet Saturday night - the place had only one other group of patrons. Their selection of whisky is indeed the largest one I've seen so far in Singapore whisky bars. Will definitely return to visit next time with friends or family. The tasting sets are a great way to try various whiskies without paying an arm and a leg for it. Though the tasting sets could be better if grouped across the regions, E.g. Islay + Highland + Speyside etc, rather than all Islay distillers or all Highland distillers.
5
The selection is endless, spans over 100 yrs, and the staff knows everything there is to know on the subject of whisky. I didn't even know what I wanted, but by answering a few questions the staff was able to deliver win after win. The atmoshpere reminds me of a cozy smoking lounge except here the air's filled with the scent of only the finest drinks! Definitely worth it to stop in and try one of the "Around the World" Samplers
5
Found out about the Auld Alliance by chance on trip advsior, was looking for restaurants but when I found out it was a Whisky Bar I had to visit! Amazing selection of whiskeys, straight to my fave the Glenfiddich 15yr Solera, generous measures and good prices too, not at all as pricey as I had imagined, approx 12 SGD for my choice which is not bad at all.The old london gentlemens club style and layout was perfect for sampling some fine Whiskeys, the wine my wife had was lovely also and they did a good selection of champagne and cocktails too.Must visit if you like Whiskey
5
Based on reviews and proximity to our hotel we visited Auld Alliance. All staff are friendly and very knowledgeable. We each were guided to exactly what we wanted. All details are thought of:- atmosphere, comfort, perfect glasses, nibbles. The prices were a very pleasant surprise after what we'd come to expect in Singapore. Closed on Sundays - unfortunately
5
Our thanks to Matthew and his extremely knowledgeable team serving us in true fashion (not small measures) from the finest selection of whiskies frae oer the world I have seen in many a year.Well done this evening and to the future success to all. Allan and Evely

I'm a whisky freak, a huge whisky freak. I just got done visiting Scotland and on average I try 200 to 300+ whiskies every year. I take my whisky club to whisky bars and whenever I travel I visit whatever whisky bars that the city features. That being the case the Auld Alliance is a MUST visit on the way home to Australia from Scotland.I'd visited quite a few distilleries, over a dozen whisky stores and DOZENS of whisky bars while in Scotland, some of them specializing in hard to find whiskies. None of them had ANYTHING on the Auld Alliance.I'd followed the Auld Alliance for over a year on Facebook, but nothing prepared me for when I walked into the bar. As soon as you walk into the bar the atmosphere hits you, hundreds upon hundreds of whisky bottles, leather, polished wood, a great atmosphere. Soft music plays in the background, you can actually talk to the person next to you and it's tasteful music, not the crap that plays at so many bars and makes you wonder why you bothered going out for a drink as opposed to staying home.So when my wife and I walk in we're greeted with this wall of whisky, Japanese, American, Canadian, Japanese and pretty much every country in the world that produces whisky is able to be found. Even better it's found in a logical way. When visiting so many whisky bars the whiskies are either thrown in by region, country, some random order that makes sense to no one but the bar manager What happens then is when you're dealing with hundreds upon hundreds of whiskies is that you're left feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to get. What happens then is you get your old standby.Here each whisky is separated into it's own country and then done alphabetically. Sounds too simple right? You'd be wrong! Even better is that the guys here have done the work for you. Even though you have some VERY highend whiskies, whiskies from as far back at 1908, is that they've done a list of easy to select, pretty much your entry level whiskies into their own category, whiskies ranging from 12 to 18 years in age, whiskies that while sometimes hard to find in a normal whisky bar, really aren't too rare.Then they have the rare whisky lists, whiskies from the early part of the century, 1920's, 30's 40's, etc. Whiskies that are higher end and some people might balk at paying for. Whiskies from distilleries that have been silent or have been destroyed decades ago. Want to try a Brora? Which one? How about Port Ellen or Rosebank or Karuizawa?! You can try them all, and in many cases, flights of them so that you can taste the evolution of the distillery. How about the Glenfarclas Family Casks? A legendary range of cask strength whiskies going back to 1952, they've got them all, able to be purchased!Even better are the prices! Yes you might flinch when you see a whisky run at $300+ for a 40ml sample, but when you do the math that this whisky might run at 15000USD a bottle, then it becomes much more reasonable. You're able to do back to back tastings comparing Macallan from the 1940's to Macallan of today. No where else have I been can you do something like this.Want to purchase a rare bottle? Yeah they can do that too! I HAD to pick up a bottle of a Japanese distillery, Karuizawa, that had been destroyed in 2002 for my collection. Old Ardbeg and I mean Ardbeg from the 1960's and 70's can be found here!The staff know their whiskies, beautifully so, able to make recommendations when asked for a particular style, i.e fruity, floral, smokey, peaty, etc with ease, even better when you ask them to avoid certain distilleries, say I want fruity and floral but no Glenmorangie, not a problem they can do that!Matt the bar manager and Emmanuel the owner are more then happy to stop by for a chat, easy to ask questions of and make suggestions, catering to every level of whiskydom, from novice all the way to whisky fiend, without ever making one feel silly or embarrassed for asking questions. Even more if it's a slower night, they might stop by and join you for a dram.And the knowledge at your fingertips is even better, being a whisky geek, writing a whisky blog, drinking hundreds of different whiskies each year you sometimes find yourself hesitating to ask a question, feeling that people might judge you.Not here! At no point was any question or comment too silly, irrelevant or inexperienced. My only regret is that I didn't budget NEARLY enough money to spend here after Scotland. A visit to the Auld Alliance is worth a trip to Singapore along if you love whisky, just make sure you bring money, because once you see that list you won't want to stop! Next time I'm spending a week here and every night will be spent at the Auld Alliance

My Husband and I had a layover in Singapore after 3 weeks in Scotland. We both enjoy our whisky's. Him more than me.The atmosphere is Exactly how you would envision a whiskey bar, but better. The only thing it didn't have was the angel's share in the air, to make it all the more enticing. Its smart without being pretentious. The staff are VERY knowledgeable and willing to share that with anyone, with or without any previous whisky knowledge. You can order tapas/finger foods from the near-by restaurants, which the staff order for you. So the only time you need to stand up is for a closer inspection of any of the rare bottles on display.An introduction to other like-minded whiskey enthusiast by the staff proved to be a winner. With the staff stopping by for more whiskey conversation and a dram themselves. I absolutely loved the experience, rare and much loved whiskies to try. Would recommend it to anyone
5
Auld Alliance is the only place in Asia where you can find the widest collection of whiskies including some of the rare ones. But don't let the library of whiskies or the classic English interior intimidate you.In fact, you will find that Auld Alliance provides the best prices you can find in town. Try their absinthe, cocktails, wines or champagnes if you are not sure if whisky if your thing.The bar also houses two - Emmanuel Dron and Matthew Fergusson-Stewart, of the friendliest and most knowledgeable experts you will ever meet. You can find out more about this water of life from them, or just engage in a friendly banter about almost anything
5
Why is this the best bar in the world for me. I have not heard of any place where you can find an open bottle of the Black Bowmore, a Samaroli Laphroaig, Macallans from every decade from the 1930s.Expect your whisky knowledge to grow immensely the more time you spend at the bar. But this place does not pretend to be an exclusive club for the well-to-do only. They also carry an immense range of contemporary single malts from Independent bottlers like Whisky Agency, Silver Seal, G&M etc as well as the official bottling from the distillery.They also have very comprehensive tasting sets and blind tasting sets and probably one of the few bars (if only), where you could try the same whisky from a bottle in the 70s and 80s. Matthew, the Manager and Emmanuel, the Director are incredible passionate and knowledgable about their whiskies.Great music and comfortable leather seats in an relaxed and spacious atmosphere round up this very special place
5
Wow... No doubt about it, if you are whisky lover then this is the place to be. Service and ambience were pretty good also.
5
The owner is French and he has collected very special whiskies, over 750 different kinds from year 1940 till now. Good place for having your whisky moment after a good meal, they have also tastings and blind teastings.
4
Visited with my father and was pretty impressed by the venue and range of scotches on offer. The bar staff were ok but In a place like this it would have been nice to have someone who knew about the various drinks. The girls who were serving simply poured and served without any real effort to interact with customers. Would have been nice to be provided with some information on each drink we ordered
4
We went to Auld Alliance for my Dad's 60th birthday. From the exterior, I wasn't really feeling the whiskey-bar vibe, but after a few minutes inside you settle into the environment and the ambiance is great. I'm not a whisky connoisseur, but the staff seemed very knowledgeable and we received excellent service. For those who are overwhelmed by the selection, the tasting menus are a great option
5
After years of visiting the 2 other "serious" Whisky bars in Singapore (the Quaich and the Highlander), we recently stumbled on the Auld Alliance, located in the Chijmes complex, adjacent to the Raffles Hotel.What a find ! Hundreds of bottles of Whisky, most of them probably impossible to find, all of them unique to a certain extent. What makes this a great collection (as opposed, for example, to the famous collection displayed on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh) is that this seems to be a really personal collection by someone who really likes Whisky. This means that there are some obvious biases, and some distilleries are not there (probably because the collector does not like them). But to me this is fine, I am not looking for an encyclopedic collection of Whisky. Seeing someone's likes and dislikes in such a stunning collection is fascinating.The main bar area is suplemented by a room with plush leather seats, ideal for sipping a good dram. Service is friendly and prices are quite reasonable.A definite must visit for anyone who enjoys Whisky

I love my Whisky and I know a fair bit about them. I'm partial to a single cask single malt that has been aged in a Bourbon cask and yes I like my Whiskies young. My friends however may choose something darker, richer, older, as they probably have a more sophisticated palate than mine and enjoy the smoky peatiness of such a Whisky. The Auld Alliance satisfies every palate because they have a massively impressive range of Whisky. I took a Scottish gentleman there who was also partial to fine Whiskies and his comment was "I've never seen a range like this. Not anywhere in the world and not even in Scotland".The old world ambiance of the "club" type room makes it comfortable to sit back and enjoy a decent conversation. The bar, which is spectacular, is also fun and great to interact with the staff and experiment with Whiskies and Absinthe. Who would have known a Frenchman could have pulled together such a place

Been to this place a couple of times and always look forward to going back. Can't beat the relaxing Chesterfield armchairs and a nice old malt to end the day.They always have something new to offer in terms of rare whisky and its good value when you think that some of these bottles are 20 years older than me

We first visited Auld Alliance at Chijmes in March 2011. It had been recommended to us by an ex colleague of my wife's who had moved from Perth to Singapore and who was establishing his whisky consultancy business. The first experience was great. The ambience of the place is fantastic with the first thing you see walking through the door being the elegant and comfortable looking leather chairs around the bar where you gaze longingly up at a thousand bottles of whisky.I was spoiled for choice and had 3 whiskys the first night while my wife had a Gin and tonic and a glass of champagne. We returned the second night and with the helpful recommendations of the staff who have an encyclopedic knowledge of the whiskys was carried to the borders of Nirvana with another 3 whiskys. Although I have been a whisky drinker for over 30 years, over the 2 nights I visited the Auld Alliance I drank whiskys I can't possibly get in Perth and in one of the best laid out and comfortable bars that only accommodates about 30 to 40 people. It was a fabulous experience.Move forward to January 2013 and we have just returned from the 3rd visit to the Alliance and if anything it has matured and become even more interesting and enjoyable. Walking in the ambience was the same as last time, the chairs are the same. The bar is the same. The magnificent Chesterfields in the side rooms are the same, except maybe for looking more comfortable, perhaps from more use over the past 2 years but the big change is in the staff.There is more self assurance, there is more pride in the knowledge they are offering a great product to appreciators of amazing whiskys and there is definitely more relaxed confidence that they will be able to satisfy any customer looking for a great whisky experience.So tonight was a fantastic Hendriks gin and tonic (I want those glasses) before embarking for dinner then a return for a 30 year old single cask Highland Park bottled exclusively by the Auld Alliance, followed by a 33 year old Benrenhie, which I had never heard of before today. It was nectar. My wife enjoyed her champagne as I was in ecstacy over the whiskys.We'll be back tomorrow night after dinner for my final 3 exceptional whisky tastes before leaving Singapore on Friday. The Auld Alliance will be a staple venue for visiting each time I come back to Singapore. In fact I can see a whisky tasting weekend with a few mates on the cards. Maybe in October. Fingers crossed

As far as whiskey appreciation goes, this boutique little joint has it nailed. Location please note is in the Chijmes behind Lei Garden. The interior ambience once reaching the bar is quite nice, once making your way through a typical Aussie pub setting that is. Which is perfectly fine on the way in. Snap back to reality on the way out though.1000 bottles of whiskey on the bar is quite an apt summary of first impressions. A comprehensive selection with a menu that makes the most budding of whiskey connoisseurs feel a little bit amateur. Which is a good thing.The menu features a small selection of whiskey sampling (tasting) menus. Which is notably the best approach to take. The owner, also the host, who is present at the bar is a French speaking guy, who is well educated on the subject and can provide a well balanced insight onto the very broad selection of whiskeys available at the venue. I do suggest asking the question " please give me a taste of a random whisky" - from a place you would not usually expect a whiskey from. It's great to try new things, and as far as whiskey is concerned, this is no exception.The venue also features a private whiskey room, which would be a spectacular venur for hosting VIP guests. As far as experiences in Singapore go, this is a highly recommended venue to visit. The complex in which it is located is a XVIII Century Gothic Monastery and is quite stunning to visit, and should you need a cab after, they are readily available. Highly impressed and recommended

We were means to be going to KL, but decided on Singapore, it was meant to be apparently since a month earlier I discovered that there was an amazing whisky bar there. If you enjoy whisky this is one of those "make time to go"places. I spent about 10 minutes gawking at the sensational selection, and then the single malts were fantastic! I tried 4 malts I never would have had the chance to else where and each one was a "moment".The guys here are great, really know their stuff and don't make you feel like an idiot for not knowing or believing something that was mistaken. Do your self a favor and visit!
