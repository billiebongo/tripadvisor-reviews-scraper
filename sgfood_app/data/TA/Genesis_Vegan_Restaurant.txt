Place closes early. One of our friends didn‚Äôt make it as one of the addresses on google is wrong :(
Ensure you head to the little India address.

Liked the food but the choices are limited. Service levels can be better as we see more groups and families turning up and waiting. The restaurant is slightly off from Race Course road. Nice family dinner spot.üëçüëç

Off the beaten path a bit, but well worth the trip to this terrific little hole-in-the-wall not far from Farrer Park. Tasty, regionally specific food, fast and friendly service, and excellent prices. Would absolutely go back.

The nonexistent service made the experience such a displeasure that the taste of the food was immediately forgettable. The food was mediocre, and vegan food can truly be marvelous. It was a disappointing experience and will never go back.

Great vegan food. We have tried Claypot, Laksa, Mushrooms and Dumpling. All dishes is must try. The best vegan place in Singapore!

I've been a big fan of Genesis since my first visit about 3 years ago & I come here at least every 3 months to satisfy my craving for their laksa. Very affordable with most main dishes around $10 or less. Lovely people & nice clean place too. Just a short walk from Farrer Park MRT but worth it! The dumplings are another must try as they come with a delicious chilli sauce!

Went to the Genesis Vegan Restaurant 3 times. The restaurant makes cookies and packages them there [you might get to watch the process, like I did]. The staff was very friendly, and easy to communicate with. Try the lasagna. The salad pictured above is the house specialty. They also offer several good organic teas

A short walk from Farrer Park (not Farrer Road) MRT. Featuring local and Westerner dishes. If you like spicy, this will not be your favourite. Good quality and tasty, too. Lots of people rave about the lasagna. Plus, they often have bread and other baked goods for purchase. Prices are reasonable

For someone who have been to this restaurant before it has been relocated here, I was skeptical about the food but my friends strongly recommended it and had asked me to give it a try after the face-lift, so I did.To my surprise this restaurant did not just have a face lift, it had an over haul and a really amazing one.The ambience is very clean and conducive with simple deco and warm lighting. The staff were extremely helpful in recommending the dishes.We ordered their signature lasagna, dumplings (both steamed and pan fried) and a dish of the day Claypool vegetables and monkey head mushroom.When I had the first bite of the dumpling, I nearly stomped my feet on the ground as it was so delicious that I forgot that it is vegetarian and it's perfectly paired with their homemade dipping sauce.The lasagna is their signature dish and the serving size justified the price and it's made of nuts and legumes, very hearty and wholesome.Lastly, the claypot is a real deal. I am a fan of anything claypot and the way they prepared this dish tells me that the chef put a lot of effort in cooking the dish because the mushroom, sea coconut, yam and broccoli were all cooked to perfection and we don't miss the meat at all. The only thing I hope they will look into is the size of the brown rice served, it is too small for the serving size of claypot.Before we headed home, the bread just came out of the oven. We bought a few lotus paste buns for the road. They are very solid with loads of yummy lotus paste filling.The restaurant also has a corner that sells organic/vegetarian supply for those who want to stock up their pantry.Overall, we were impressed by the restaurant concept and the quality of vegan food. We are definitely coming back with friends and family.Tips 1. The nearest mrt station to the Farrer Park but be sure to take the right exit to get here.2. The restaurant closes on Saturdays, if you decide to come on weekends
