Passed by and stop for a quick bite. Food is mediocre and slightly over priced for a fast food place. The rice, magadara, was good and well seasoned. Overall mediocre.

Working in CBD area I am always on the lookout for fresh good healthy dishes, was quite surprised that I did not noticed Omnivore. For a price of 9.90 you get One protein one carb and three toppings, I selected the beef as protein and top up a dollar. Food was tasty and generous portion as compared to Avorush who are stingy with the portion. Recommended

Food consistent as I ate there twice . Looking for some healthy salads ? It's a good place To go , try the duck breast , quite juicy . Chicken breast could be better . All in all great food , but price could be cheaper to be more value for mone

I head to the raffles outlet everyday and decided to check out the sail outlet today as there were some differences.I am a fitness instructor and one of the kind who is very particular about eating clean, and so I chose omnivore over a lot of places around even if I had to walk a distance over.First I asked, what cut do you guys use for the 'torched steak', as I thought they used a different one from the raffles outlet, which is sirloin.None of the girls there knew, and nobody could give me an answer and said 'we don't know, boss order, I just serve'. Until they decided to ask the chef which was just right behind prepping my steak order.Next I saw was while waiting for my steak to be done, all the girls were sitting down, some chatting at the cashier counter and some standing, using their phones, leaving some food uncovered and I witnessed a mosquito feeding on one of the chicken thighs.Seriously do these people even care about food cleanliness at all? There is no email that I could write to the boss so let's hope someone from the company sees this and decided to rectify it. Thirdly, no nets/card payment, cash only for both outlets. Tons of inconvenience if you had a distance to walk to the ATM machine

Located in the basement of Chevron House, in a sort of food-court-style setting where you order your food from whichever stall you want, & find a table to sit at. I was struggling to finish 1 bowl.. They're so generous with their ingredients! & this is the 1 protein bowl, not the 2 or 3 protein one. No extra ingredients other than the basic stuff.I really like barley rice, & their chicken is quite moist & tender. Mushrooms juicy. Those are my favourites. Would eat here again 1 protein: $9.902 proteins: $12.903 proteins: $15.9

Chanced upon a new takeaway place Omnivore @ The Sail when I was using the underpass @ The Sail. Thought I would give it a try. For $9.90 for 1 protein, I also get to chose a carb or green, a dressing and 3 toppings. For each choice, there are more than 5 selections to choose from, e.g. for protein, there's chicken breast or thigh, tuna, beef, duck etc, for carb or green, there's romain lettuce, brown rice, barley rice, baby spinach etc . There are additional charges for certain selections and also if you want to get more item for a choice.I didn't have high expectations so I was pleasantly surprised at my meal, it was slightly warm and tasted really good - I think the sesame dressing that I chose made a big difference. It's now my new go-to place for takeaway lunch

So I built my own salad of chicken breast (protein), romaine lettuce, 3 toppings with a honey soy dressing. Taste wise, it was slightly above average, but definitely no wow factor. Value wise, at $9.90, I'd give it a 9! It was filling and they were generous with their ingredients. The chicken breast itself was almost a meal on its own. Thumbs up
