A good place that's been featured many times on local channels!
Their best dishes is mashed fried potatoes üòç
One of the things I always visited for other then that it would be the usual chicken chop fried rice.

Its hard to get cheaper steaks in SG. I loved that the steaks here are served piping hot! Their steaks are still tender and served with a cute fried potato ball. Also do try their fried chicken wings if you can. Its awesome!

One of my favorite place for good chicken chop and cutlet. The chicken was never over cooked, always moist even when it is deep fried. This is a good place to have a good meal with heartland price.

My family had a great dinner @ Uno Beef. The tenderloin was done just right for medium rare. Just the way we like it. Good job to the Chef!

Steaks are served on hot plate with a delicious butter potato ball. Must try! Try to come by 630pm on Sundays as orders pile up fast and you could end up waiting 30 minutes or more for your food to arrive

Had the black pepper beef sirloin set $15. Came with mash potato (deep fried ball), baked beans, a slice of tomato. Friendly owners and fast service..

Don't order the steak, chicken chop/chicken wings are better. The steak is expensive for the quality. Spend your money on their chicken dishes instead.

An interesting discovery as I usually frequent the Lorong 5 hawker center just down the road and never knew this place existed! Probably why they placed a signboard along Lorong 5, to let people know this place existed.They have fried rice, spaghetti, chicken chops, fried fish and steaks. I did not try it, but the beef stew looked yummy. My daughter had chicken spaghetti which was normal, while I had fried rice with chicken. The rice was a bit cold but the chicken was nice! We also ordered mash potato, which was interesting as it was crispy outside, while soft and chewy inside

Definitely, you'll want one more time in Uno Beef House, even after just completing your meal. What a find ! Sirloin steak for 15SGD. It comes with fried potato balls, beans and a slice of tomato. Soft and succulent. The sauce is mildly spiced. Good quality steaks, at "hawker" prices. This place can get packed so it is best to come on non-peak hours like after lunch or after dinner. Service is warm and quick.

Came over to this Coffeeshop for the famous mince pork mushroom noodles. Decided to order some chicken wings to share while waiting . Golden fried pipping hot wings arrived and we were totally in awe after sinking in the first bite. Fresh, nicely fried, tasty and ofcourse juicy. That very split second, a little regret came as we had ordered our noodles else we surely will try their famous beef steak. Definitely will be back for you UNO. Thumbs up !

UNO is by far the best Western food in Singapore with range of variety which suit everyone and price that is worth it. Most important of all is the food is damn delicious. Highly recommended. üíØüòãüëç

I was in Toa Payoh with some colleagues and were taking them to lunch. We arrived at this stall and I recommended them to try the Fried rice with fried chicken cutlet. It comes with an egg done sunny side up. It costs $6. The chicken cutlet is a chicken drumstick and thigh deboned, coated with batter and deep fried. Its succulent on the inside. Squeeze the lemon over it and it is yummy. The fried rice is simply fried with ham and mixed vegetables. My colleagues enjoyed the chicken cutlet, but felt the rice was average. I also ordered the fried potato balls. These are mash potatoes that are rolled into a ball and deep fried. The mash potatoes are creamy and smooth on the inside. I think they use a good amount of butter. The outer skin is thin and crispy, without any use of breadcrumbs. Each ball costs $1.Overall still good. Try it

The rib-eye steak must be one of the best and affordable one can find in an HDB estate. Service is fast, and food well-done and consistently great. Fried rice with chicken chop is just as good with the rice tastily well-cooked and chicken well grilled. You will be hooked after you have your first bite

Located at a coffeshop in Toa Payoh, Uno serves good Western food at a reasonable price.I like their fried rice with chicken chop which is topped with an egg done sunny side up.Another favorite of mine is the beef stew which comes with plain rice. This is in limited portions daily and do go early to avoid disappointment. The fried potato balls are also recommended. These are mash potato rolled into a ball and deep fried. They are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. You must order 2 for ala carte orders.Recommended

A great alternative to coffee shop western food. Located as a stand alone eating place at the corner of a block 51 along Loring 5 Toa Payoh. Purely local clientele and have yet to see any tourist there. Above average steaks with good sides. Prices are very reasonable and portions are large. A must do for families looking for a budget but wholesome meal

I would normally eat there on weeknights. weekends crowd can sometimes cause you to wait up to an hour for your food. $11-$12 for a decent basic steak. I like my medium rare and it is served with fried potato and bake beans & bread at the side. no frills delicious beef steak but easy on the pocket! Other western food selection is also available, like chicken chop, chicken cullet, fried rice with sunny side up etc
