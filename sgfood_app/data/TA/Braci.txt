It's a great dining experience, love the environment, food and services. Roof top bar is great to chill too !

Crowded Friday night. Had the degustation. Starter of scallop was very good, though the other starter of beef tartare was not my favourite. Dessert very good.
5
Fantastic dinner in a very personal setting. Exclusive service and personal staff. Lovely ending with a drink on the rooftop bar.

Very nice bar being open air on top of the building showcasing the city skyline. The food is above average although for us they are on small portion side. Price is reasonable for a michelin rated restaurant. Chef Beppe is very engaging and so are all the staff. The kitchen is definitely in the right spot where all the diners can see the action
4
The foods were good except we were advised to order from the a la carte menu for the signature dishes. We did not expect the recommended number of dishes were so much with such huge servings. We could not finish the foods, wasted the foods and paid a big bill for it. I would view such service as a little unprofessional even though the staff was a very pleasant person with whom we enjoyed the conversation.

My partner and I decided to dine at Braci for a little change of pace from our usual French-inspired dining in Singapore. Located on the top two floors of an old building in the generally low-end restaurant and bar row of Boat Quay overlooking the National Museum and Singapore River, Braci is unique in its construction in that the kitchen is located in the middle of the small dining room so interaction with the kitchen staff is easy and encouraged. Dishes are delivered and explained both by the owner and the chefs and they are superb! Service is efficient and friendly and the food is out of this world and very, very, very Italian--not American red sauce, but genuine regional Italian cooking from Puglia and north. The wine list is excellent (I found a wine from a tiny vineyard I happened to know outside of Lucca--a wine I have never seen outside of Italy!) and reasonably priced. Above all, the staff make you feel like you were in an Italian home where the owner just happened to be a spectacular chef. Well deserving of its Michelin star and well deserving of a visit when you are in Singapore

We went for the Menu Gourmand - the composition of which varies as you indicate to the chef which dish(es) from the à la carte menu you may wish to have. The food is among the most refined and subtle Italians you’ll find in Singapore. However, what makes Braci truly unique is, because the restaurant is so small, you can engage in conversations with the staff, and especially with the talented and enthusiastic polyglot chef Beppe De Vito, a real artist. If Braci were larger (and demonstrate it could achieve the same quality with scale), it would have two Michelin stars, not one. That said, although the dishes are innovative, beautifully plated and refined, the nearby Osteria Art (also owned by chef Beppe) serves more hearty Italian meals (especially the pastas, which are the best in Singapore!) Incidentally, very good wine list, with many ‘reasonably-priced’ Brunello’s and Barolo’s

You have to take a lift to the fifth floor of a narrow Boat Quay shophouse.It is owned by the same group that runs Il Lido and Osteria Art.The dining area is rather small and does not cater well to large groups.It is in an open kitchen which feels intimate but ventilation needs to be drastically improved!Service by the chef was good but the waiter needed to smile more!The four course menu was just nice.After amuse bouche a salad was served, followed by a delicious scallop dish.Next was a masterful lobster tagliolini dish.Main course was guinea fowl which was nice.The dessert was excellent.The meal ended with delightful petit fours.Worth a repeat visit

4 times here with friends/family everytime it is flawless in terms of food & service. There was one time power failure but that did not deter us from having a great meal. The rooftop was where we dine. All was well...they took care of me & my guests pretty well.Enjoyed a cocktail or two with the ever brilliant bartender at the rooftop who never fail to come up w a new concoction that suits our base...brilliant as I get to name it after me...Love the fettuccine clams/scallops/beef tartare/pigeon! We are always back as my kids and I love the pigeon here ;)Keep up the good work team Braci...bravi

As soon as we've discovered this place in Internet, we've decided to give it a try and I still bless my/our decision.The location is up on a building in one on the major streets in Singapore. The restaurant is very small, just few tables, so prior reservation is mandatory. This Italian 1 star Michelin restaurant really surprised me in many aspects, fist of all, the staff, all young people around 30, this means that a sparkly touch of creativity to the food is assured. 2nd, you truly see what they are cooking as the kitchen is open and just besides you and you can see how clean is the place and the chefs preparing your "delicatessen". I immediately recognized Italians, as I am Italian too and I started to make conversation (Italians, especially abroad are friendly and lovely people), I was amused that the chef, Mirko, is from my same region, so we've started to talk of food that we miss and actually he cocooned us (especially me) with some original tastes from Puglia, like stracciatella and Pane di Altamura. So, skipping the emotional part of me, let's jump into the menu. We had 4 choices 3 set menus and à la carte. We've decided to go for the second set menu and the Chef surprise us with a straciatella foam with withe truffle of Alba, delicious, a fois gras with vincotto drops (that I will remember for the rest of my life), an Hokkaido scallops plus guanciale soup, tagliolini with uni, caviar and crab, really amazing, also the presentation of the plate was really gorgeous, mayoral wagyu, (it really tasted as chocolate!!!!)with charcoal gnocchi and black truffles. For dessert he prepared for me a gianduiotto with Italian hazelnuts, while my partner had a strawberry cheesecake. What to say? I can't wait to get back I really had a wonderful experience. Grazie Mirko! A prestissimo!!!
5
Food was good and service was good.
Would prefer the air con to be stronger as it is kinda warm in the afternoon
4
Good overall. Particularly like the razor clam pasta and the desserts. Abit smoky inside have to find a way to improve ventilation
5
Joint family and friends for a wedding party in this roof top place and enjoyed the evening, the excellent food and the great wine and drink selection very much. Very nice, friendly and professional service made the evening a great success. Very good!
5
This restaurant has a michelin star within one year of opening and this is not a surprise! Reservation is a must as the total number of seats are not more than twenty. The open kitchen concept captures your attention. The view is good and I suggest you go for the window tables if in a smaller group
5
I'm not sure how I stumbled upon Braci, but I quickly showed this to my partner and she was very excited to go.We were greeted and seated near the kitchen (well all seats are next to the kitchen, it's a very intimate place). Chef Mirko greeted us and was incredibly friendly. It also helped my partner was also from the same region as him in Italy, so they immediately became best friends lol.We started with white Alba truffles, stracciatella + pumpkin. This was amazing.Next was a semifreddo foie gras + vinvotto. Normally I find foie gras too overpowering, but this was fantastic. Hand dived Hokkaido scallop, guanchiale + zucca was next, and this was lovely. There was a significant amount of scallop as well, which is a change from most places.King crab tagliolini, uni + caviar. This was by far my favorite dish of the night. Everything just went so well together.Mayura wagyu, gnocchi + truffles. This was fantastic too! I had never heard of this cattle from Australia, I was told it was from Tasmania, but it's actually in South Australia, near the famed Limestone Coast. Hint, you guys can probably match a wine from the Limstone Coast with the Mayura dish, it'd be pretty cool!Gianduiotto with hazelnut cream was our first dessert, and this was so good. Normally dark chocolate can be a bit too bitter for me, but I loved it so much.The final dessert dish was a strawberry cheesecake with meringue and icecream. This was by far the best dessert I've had in 2017.The only con I had about this place was how hot it was. I understand it's a small place, but it gets very uncomfortable after a while. I felt sorry for the people dining there in dinner jackets and layered dresses!Everyone here was super friendly, especially chef Mirko. Top that off with the best Italian cuisine I've had possibly ever, it was a night to remember. We will be back one day

Average food for the price you have to pay. We ordered a dish that had run out, so the chef suggested we try another. We happily agreed, however was surprised to see that the recommended dish was about double the price of what we had originally wanted to order. Air conditioning was not great, and we were slightly uncomfortable with the heat throughout the meal
4
I have my birthday celebration in Braci. First time for me and my friends. We felt a bit warm when step into the restaurant, may be because is a open kitchen. The manager introduced a few cocktails and it was nice. Foie gras with kumquat was yummy. The Tuna Tartare was delicious. The pasta is what I loved most. Beef was beautifully cooked except the side vegetable was a bit too salty. We all love the dessert. I would said give a try if you like Italian food with nice plating
5
Braci is one of those places that you will always want to re-visit. The chef himself did all the explaining on the dishes. The bread was unique and will surely be a highlight of your visit. I had the lunch set which includes a tagliolini with ikura and squid ( one of the best I've ever had), as well as beef tenderloin, and dessert. Overall, you will definitely be satisfied and got full dining here
4
Cosy interior with great view of Marina bay. Open kitchen concept allows lots of lovely aromas to come your way during dining. Tasting menu offers a good spread of dishes. Standout was the pork cheek and jowl, which is a must-have if you eat here. Lighter on the pasta too, for those wanting less carbs.
4
We came right after they were first recognised with the Michelin 1-Star. We enjoyed the food. We came back on a weekday in November. And things have changed. Chef Beppe was no longer cooking most of the dishes and was essentially supervising and training the other Chef. They also ran of their pork cheek specialty. Good to know they have to limit their prep as it has to be freshly prepared.Service was still very good though we almost got shocked when we realised that the fresh truffle pasta order was as expensive the Surprise Menu! Chef Beppe was kind enough to let us know we may have over ordered. He joked that we were paying for the truffle and the pasta was free. It was outstanding but not something I would splurge on.Still loved the special century old traditional bread. The steak was cooked tenderly though not as special as the pork cheek specialty. Dessert were visual delight and was a great way to cap the meal.We will come back but will pre-order the pork cheek and also hope Chef Beppe is healing the kitchen. Nothing like the master Chef cooking vs. supervising
4
Love their bread and homemade pasta. Food is generally great. The place is rather warm cos it's small and an open kitchen concept. My husband was perspiring throughout.
3
averagely-good italian food which many other italian restaurants can either match or surpass. how did it get a 1-michelin star?!
5
This is my 5th visit & the food & service never goes wrong. The food always surprises me with favours & creativity. Definitely a restaurant that I will keep bringing friends.
5
This is my 3rd visit here. Food and service very consistent. Keep up the good work! Till the next visit!
5
Was invited here for dinner and was very impressed with the food. Chef/Owner personally attended to us. I liked their bread made from 100+ year old yeast. All the dishes were exquisitely prepared and delicious.
5
Chef Beppe created an amazing cosy restaurant.
You feel like being home and enjoying a fantastic meal.
Great atmosphere, great staff and fantastic Chef.
Bravo

We had the set lunch at Braci ($55++). The food was very good. Love the Tagliolini with truffles. The Romanesco with Burrata cheese was also very good. The cheese was almost cream like in texture, not the standard sticky Burrata one finds elsewhere. The Italian Sea Bass was also very good with a crispy skin over the grill snapper. The quantity of fish looked small but thankfully we were full after dessert. The dessert was Caramel Chocolate Parfait which was beautifully done. To finish off we had a choice of coffees and teas. Giving a 3 for atmosphere as the room became slightly warm by the end of our meal due to the open kitchen.
4
The team treats you like a friend visiting their home with warmth and attentive service. I was at a table with a lovely view of the Singapore River and the whole downtown landscape. The best part about eating here is being treated to warm bread made in the tradition of the chef’s hometown and other produce that reminds one that we are dining in an Italian restaurant after all. So all the expensive ingredients like uni just lets us feel we are paying for value. But we are actually looking to be surprised and excited by good culinary skills.

Singapore has so many excellent restaurants, never mind just “really good”, that I think it’s very difficult to stand out. However it’s easy to make mistakes and trip. One way is to be so “nouvelle cuisine” that your guests leave wondering “How? Why?” To be clear the service was very good, very polite, and accommodating to our requests (no mushrooms due to allergies - oddly today there were mushrooms all over the place). I can not fault the service. However...The first issue is the setting itself. We ate in the main room which is also the kitchen. It was so hot they moved us table, yet someone else had to sit there after us. Even at the new table the heat was suffocating and frankly we didn’t linger. We came for lunch and had the set menu. Between the two of us we chose each set. The starters were very small and I would say if average flavour and quality, though with a great deal of “preparation”. I’ve had nicer tuna tartar at Bread Street Kitchen, where it’s easily a shareable starter (not so here). The sea bass was nice, though lacking salt, but there were EXACTLY two forks of fish. For $55 I expected more. My wife had the tenderloin which was incredibly tasty, but, again, very small (though MUCH bigger than the fish). The total LUNCH with wine came to over $200, too much for what was served, never mind for lunch.
5
The small dining room with the open kitchen was fully booked, no doubt a common occurrence with such great food on offer. The staff from the Manager down were most professional, offering considered assistance in discussing the choices on the menu, the wine list and the pairing of both. We enjoyed an excellent 4 course degustation menu with a crisp Chablis and well matched Brunello to accompany the tasty and elegantly presented food. The amuse bouche trio, appertisers of Romanesco burrata cheese and hazelnuts and razor clams in fettuccini lead on to succulent Australian tenderloin for main course and finally granduiotto (Frangelico cream and hazelnuts) for dessert.A pleasantly fresh and not too sweet Lemoncello was an excellent finish and made our walk home around Boat Quay even more enjoyable. A memorable meal
5
Braci gave an experience that was educational and enjoyable. The chef made effort to explain the origins of his ingredients and the technique involved in the making of the dishes. I was really impressed with their service and the experience.
5
We are impressed by the charcoal grill and the descent open kitchen. The chef and staff are all very nice. We love the home made bread and the grilled pigeon the best!
4
Set lunch showcased cooking of dishes from appetiser to mains to dessert. I like it that price includes pre-appetisers and coffee which ‘completes’ the meal for me.
5
Excellent food and a great chef who attends personally to you. Restaurant ambience is nice if you ask for the window seats.
5
Nowadays it is rare to find really good food without paying a bomb for it. It is value for money if you want Michelin Star quality Italian food.
5
Tucked away on the 5th floor you will find a hidden gem, where you are part of the kitchen action, every table is a "chef's table" given the size and limited tables. It allows the chef to personally explain each course for a great personal touch. Food was excellent and good value given it is 1 star and quality of the ingredients. Creative but not over the top. Great experience all round. Next time need to come earlier to check out the roof top bar
4
Relatively short menu, but where everything is cooked in an innovative way and plated like art. The risotto is sublime. Impressive ratio of chefs to guests. Service is outstanding, with a chef coming to your table to explain EVERY single dish. Perhaps the best one-Michelin-starred restaurant in Singapore. If the décor was a bit more formal, it should have two
5
A hidden gem tucked away on top of a shophouse along Boat Quay, the restaurant’s interior is warm and cosy with an open kitchen concept. We were pleasantly surprised to see Beppe, the owner of the restaurant group cooking and explaining the dishes to us personally. We chose the 5-course ‘gourmand’ menu and were blown away by the impeccable tastes, plating and story behind each dish. Every course served is a work of art – Sea urchin pasta, Foie gras semifreddo, Beef tenderloin and an unforgettable Gianduiotto dessert. We later found out that they have a nice rooftop bar on the top level above the restaurant. We’ll definitely be back for more
5
The restaurant setting was small, cosy and intimate. I love all the interior design and furnishings (including the lights)! The food was great and it was nice to hear the chef explain the dishes when he served us personally. We had the tasting menu but when I saw the beef tartare served at another table, we decided to go for it and it was a good decision! The birthday celebration piece was nicely done on the dessert. When we proceeded to the rooftop bar, we had the space to ourselves for a while. It was lovely with the night view and signature cocktails. The service by Joseba and team was very good. We appreciated having time to chat with him and Vino. It was a wonderful dinner experience
5
we had the pleasure having dinner in this very nice restaurant. We chose the suprise menu and we enjoyed our evening with excellent dishes with Italian top ingredients (wine, oil, black truffels, etc). we apprreciated watching the chefs cooking. After this great experience we have been to their roofbar with wonderfull view. We really advice this restaurant
5
One of the best set lunches ive had and well deserving of their michelin star! Unlike most restaurants they dont skimp just cos its a set lunch. My favourite part was definitely the dessert. A beautiful cheesecake like dome. Fantastic service there too.
4
place is small but cosy.. Love the open concept kitchen but it will be perfect if the staff can be more smiley.. :)
5
Came back 2nd time & never fail to surprise. Starter to main was simply yummy. Cheesecake dessert was to die for. Highly recommend!
5
Awesome! Definitely worth a visit! Trust the chef with the Surprise 4-courses set, you will love it!
4
Love everything about Braci, the food the people and the view. However the place is a bit too hot due to the open kitchen concept. Can't do anything about it which is a bit pity.
5
It was an intimate Italian restaurant with a roof top bar. Excellent food and service. The owner Pepe was a gem !
5
Lovely place with an amazing view of the Fullerton area and the ferries wheel. It's like we are dining in the kitchen which shows you how close we are the to the stove - I could feel the heat from there. So we spent the whole night watching all the beautiful dishes being played. We ordered the menu "surprise" so great to see the dishes coming out. Cook did a fantastic job "marketing" the dishes like "my brother planted these in October in my area of Italy..... " almost every dish had a story. Can't wait to be back to try the a la carte dishes
4
Had a few drinks at the roof top bar before dinner- fantastic view for the breezy evening. We did not go for the degustation dinner, ordered hand-dived scallops and beef tartare as starters. Beef tartare was fabulous. The condiments definitely complemented the dish seamlessly. Scallops were worth the calories. Pork cheek was tender and was enough to fill us up! Felt that the sea bass was a tad "fishy" and the saffron sauce didn't contribute much. Strawberry cheese cake dessert was superb! Somewhat refreshing and actually a good ending to the meal. Service staff were helpful and explained every dish with so much passion
4
We were fortunate to have been told that Braci had a beautiful rooftop with a stunning view so we booked a table at the rooftop for our dinner. (Do ask for a dinner menu). Braci is located about a third from the beginning of Boat Quay nearer to the UOB end. It was indeed a lovely view of the Singapore River and the Central Business District. We ordered the Steak tartare, foie gras and shared the pork cheeks. I must admit that Chef Beppe has an artist's eye for presenting the dishes in a delightful manner. It was a feast for both the eyes and the gourmand in me. I love steak tartare and this was pretty good although very untraditional. The sauce accompaniment was delicious. The foie gras came on a box where there was the toasted bread hidden inside. The highlight was the bread served at the table with an amazing olive oil homemade from the Chef's family. So yummy and according to the chef from his very own hometown in Italy. The pork cheeks were slightly under salted (I like my food with hearty salt but my dinner companion didn't complain one bit). The pork cheeks were presented to us showing off a huge pig head and the result was a delicious dish. The ambience is lovely, the food was good and the Spanish server really was polished and entertaining. Thank you Chef Beppe for a wonderful evening and continued success in getting another Michelin sta
5
We visited Braci on Monday evening for a second time - first time we came over before the restaurant received Michelin star early this year. No disappointment but pure joy and we are reassured that they deserve Michelin award. The food is excellent, as expected - for starters we tried burrata & romanesco, scallop in sweet corn and tuna with truffles. All different, all great - with burrata being the personal favourite. For the main course we went for trout and for pigeon - again, perfect balance of ingredients and interesting composition. Lastly, we tried strawberry cheesecake for dessert, lovely served and tasted perfect.Service is very attentive but does not give an uptight feeling. The kitchen is the middle of the dining room which makes the guest feel very cosy in the elegant setting. You can finish off with a great cocktail at the restaurant's rooftop to end a great evening enjoying CBD view.
5
You love cocktails and want to enjoy the best as you will never and never find in other place around the world? Go to Braci and ask Joseba....this guy is just a magician!
5
I didn't realise that they had just obtained their star when I booked the restaurant for lunch with a business associate. We both had the set which was great value. Portions aren't great but all the 3 courses I had were excellent. The pasta, fish and chocolate cake were really wonderful as was the bread they served. Service was great and Beppe took the time to explain each dish. I'm not one to lavish praise on a restaurant but I am making an exception for Braci. This is a winner in my book
5
Quite tricky to find, on the 5th floor down a little office corridor is this wonderful little Italian restaurant overseen by owner Beppe. Food is unashamedly Italian, but very refined with their own sourdough, olive oil from Beppe's farm in Puglia and all the dishes accomplished and beautiful. The beef tartare and the crispy duck were 2 favourites. There is an excellent wine list
5
Still relatively easy to book my reservation. Ordered the 4-course Surprise degustation menu and enjoyed Chef Mirko's masterpieces. The Amuse Bouche was already superb combination of Flavours followed by the german asparagus starter. The seafood pasta was truly special with the smoked salmon blending well with the salmon roe. The pork cheek reminded of Philippine lechon head though he managed to create a symphony of flavours. Dessert was likewise excellent.We willl be back
5
The food here is very good and we had a table close to the open kitchen area. The fois gras was extremely good to start as was the duck for main course. It is clear that a lot of effort goes in to the preparation. The table inside was great but there is also an open terrace with lovely views across boat quay.
5
We hadn't booked and the restaurant was busy so we opted for the sample plates on the roof top bar overlooking Boat Quay and you just can't beat that view. The staff were attentive and helpful and the ambience perfect. We ordered a couple of dishes namely the beef which melted in the mouth and the Tuna which was great too then chilled with a well priced bottle wine. After my food heaven feeling started to lull we went all in and ordered the foie gras and duck which surpassed all expectations and literally danced on my tongue and left me with what can only be described as a happy glow. You can see why they have been awarded a Michelin Star this place is great my heart felt congratulations i cant wait to try the restaurant I'll book next time
5
Friendly, talented and gorgeous staff. Amazing food, cocktails and wine, with a super special view of Singapore. The five course surprise menu is always fantastic, and good value at $100 per person. The open kitchen is a novelty that doesn't wear off. The food is amazing (I know I've said this twice, it is *that* good), I've been back several times. This is now top of the list for places I have business meetings and take anyone new in town. I've heard they've open for lunch, which just gives me more options to go!Whether you just want to check out the view with a few cocktails or have a special meal, this needs to be on the top of your list. I spoke to the chef and they can prepare the surprise menu vegan on request if advised prior
5
We absolutely recommend the 5 course set, to fully appreciate the array of superb flavors offered by Braci.Japanese stile open kitchen, Italian authentic ingredients and taste.... fantastic combination.Chief Mirko came personally to descrive every course feature. A bit of poetry added to every delicious plate.Well done guys, 5 stars experience!!
5
I have read good reviews about this place and decided to celebrate my birthday there. We had the 5 course degustation at $100 per head. Every course was excellent. Right from the bread they served, which was baked in house and toasted with their josper grill oven, to their delicious olive oil. Service was very good, and every course was explained in details. Really, really good food!
5
We found this restaurant by accident on a Wednesday evening at around 9pm without a reservation and were seated immediately. We chose the Surprise 5 course taster menu together with a couple of glasses of white wine and a bottle of house red recommended by our waiter (after consulting the chefs on the surprises in store). All the food was excellent and prepared right in front of us, as the kitchen is right in the middle of the restaurant. The chefs explained each dish, source of ingredients and inspiration as it was served. At just over SGD400 we found this to be good value compared to other fine dining restaurants we have visited and considering the relatively high prices in Singapore compared to our home in the UK. I would recommend to anyone who appreciates good food
5
Best service in town. A hidden rooftopbar in boat quay with one of the best views in Singapore. The service is suplime! The best serviceminded employes in Singapore! Top!!!!
5
One of the best restaurant I tried recently in Singapore. Thank you so much for this amazing experience.
4
Good but a bit overpriced. Despite the booking at 8 we had to wait almost 1h before having a table.
But overall location is very nice. I like the bar on the top.
5
I went there for a friend's farewell dinner, and we ordered the five course set, which cost SGD100 (excluding drinks and tax). All of us really enjoyed it. The staff and chef were attentive. They explained each dish and the ingredients used. You can also observe the cooking from the open kitchen, which we also enjoyed a lot. We really feel the chef is really passionate about the food and customers in return also felt the same way. All five dishes were top quality. Compared to other top fine dining places in Singapore which easily cost beyond SGD200, Braci's price is reasonable. The night view is also superb. If we really have to be picky about this restaurant, I would say the size of restaurant is too small, so each table is very close. Also, you have to wait patiently for each dish to arrive, so in the end we actually spent three hours to finish all five courses. Anyway, despite these, we still love this restaurant. We will definitely come back!
5
the location is really pretty, the bar upstairs offers a beautiful view of Boat Quay and the bay. The restaurant has something homely and the kitchen is really open (all cooked right in front of you)! The staff is friendly and each dish is explained to the detail. The flavour is unique.Must try: bone marro
5
We were given great service and the chef was very attentive and listened to what we like to eat and cooked it up just right. The food was amazing! Given the price and quality, it is totally worth it. Casual fine italian food dining experience in a small cosy place, would be nicer is the space is bigger. As it gets crowded, the dining experience is not that great as you can hear the conversations from the next table!
5
We ordered from the ala carte menu as I wasn;t too hungry, but the appetisers and mains were excellent! The chef was very engaging too, and came by to explain every dish. He also made small dishes for us and it was all excellent! Enjoyed my dining experience there, and will certainly return!
5
Booked this restaurant without much expectation except for good service since it's part of the il Lido group. It is a cozy restaurant with attentive staff & very attentive chef. Some produce is from chef's dad's farm in Italy. Excellent food & cocktail selection with great view on rooftop. Price was reasonable considering the quality. Had a great time
5
Started in the roof too bar and had a drink while enjoying the fantastic view of Boat Quay and the surrounding area.Down in the restaurant we had the five courses dinner. Not your typical/ordinary Italian dishes, but a refreshing new angle on many of them. Most of them from the Southern part of Italy. Very tasty, beautifully served and good quality ingredients/products. Some of the products were even sourced from the family farm in Italy. Doesn't get much more authentic than thatPrice for 5 courses was SGD 100, which we found reasonable considering what we enjoyed. Also a nice wine menu. We left with no room for more - in the good sence :-)The dining area contains an open kitchen to which all the table have a great view. The kitchen is quitly run and doesn't disturb the evening. To me it only enhances the experience to see the dishes unfold in the hands of the skilled staff.A truely enjoyable evening
5
This is a superb little find in a somewhat touristy part of town. The restaurant only has 18 seats and an open kitchen ,giving diners the impression that they dine in the kitchen. The food is prepared delicately and refined in taste. We chose to select the five course menu and all dishes were selected by the chef. The duck was incredible and so was the pasta with read shrimp. A great place for an excellent meal in the overcrowded Singapore dining scene
