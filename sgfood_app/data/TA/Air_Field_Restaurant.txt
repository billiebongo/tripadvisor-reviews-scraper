A very popular place with locals. Great range of dishes - ranging from seafood in all its forms (try the Assam fish head curry if you like it hot) to good value yum-cha. Prices are very reasonable and the Tiger beer is nice and cold.Certainly not fine dining, but a lovely, casual place to relax and eat well in

This establishment has a long history of service to pilots, airline techs, military and others working at and near the airport. More recently tourists have joined the throngs. It has fast food chinese, and seafood, cold beers and the authentic Singapore sidewalk hawker centre feeling that is fast disappearing in the throngs of tourists. It is by no means highbrow food but worth a stop for the experience
