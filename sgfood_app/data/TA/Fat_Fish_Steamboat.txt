Soups base of Tomyum and chicken available. Tasteful!!! Shrimp wanton and beef fillet are the best. All the meats and veggies are really fresh. Furthermore, attentive staff too.

We arrived at around 8pm on a Sat night and the place was full. Service was very polite and told us to come back in 30mins time and we would definitely have a table. Sure enough there were a few. However it would be great if they had issued out queue numbers for us so we knew our spots were guaranteed. Lesson learnt: either come earlier to guarantee a seat or call or reserve or come past 830pm!Food wise we chose the Mookata buffet which costs ~$30/adult (discount for NTUC card members!). It was great with a wide selection of meats (some marinated, some shabushabu style) and seafood, veggies and various fishball-ish stuff. However if you're not much of an eater, there is also an A la carte option. Some dishes were self-service at a chilled corner inside while others had to be ticked in an order sheet and passed to the waiter. Food is very promptly served and used plates quickly cleared. We had plenty of table space to fit many dishes which all came at once. They also placed a jug of our soup next to us so we could keep refilling when low. Service was excellent. One waiter even offered to help us scoop rice when we asked where it was as we had missed it. Ambience and music was very chill and casual. Great place to catch up with friends!

I was there during Xmas with my family and friends and I simply got a shock when I was there........the foods they serve are awesome as they are so fresh and yummy....... they even have 2 different soup in 1 steamboat and i take the tom yum and my kids take the normal soup which is not spicy......... it's a very good concept for family especially like us with kids........ They also have mookata which as you can try some bbq if you don't like steamboat......... the staffs are also very friendly and won't not forget to bring a smile while talking to us......... I'm looking forward to my birthday as plan to host a party with friends as the place is comfortable and cosy.........

Usually my buddies will gather to eat at Fat Fish, They actually travel from the west all the way up. They miss the fishballs, and some other items as well, Our recent visit, they were quite disappointed as the famous :hum: became a special item. But its okie, coz we still enjoyed our time and will still visit fat fish again

The varieties is very wide . Have vege. Meat. Fish . Noodles . Rices..... too spoiled for choices. Environment is cosy as its entrance is at back. Service is also good. Go try it. U will love it if u like steamboat
