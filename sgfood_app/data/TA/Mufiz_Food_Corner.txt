Walked across from our hotel to this eating joint at a busy intersection. The mouth-watering pictures of food attracted us. Very tasty & extremely reasonable food,with friendly staff too!

When I come to Singapore, i always eat here: excellent value for the price. You can tell the waiter your budget and he will serve you accordingly. This is a chain and you can spot them in Geylang, Little India and Rochor too. They are also close to MRTstations

We had a couple of meal from here during our stay. This is a Halaal place so were were very comfortable. The place was clean too as there were no upset of our sensitive stomachs. Some of the food we tried was excellent and some not so. The prices were pretty cheap too and the portions were generous. We loved their fresh apple juice, it was excellent and also their sea-food friend rice. The mutton keema lacked flavor and the chapathi was kind of dry. A good meal for two was like 15-20SGD
