Very casual. Authentic local food cooked well. Very reasonable prices. Always crowded so be prepared to wai t for a table.

Sometimes it is hard to find great food and an authentic experience
If come here you will find both. And at a reasonable price. Actually a very good price with great service

Gotta love this place. So handy as it's what you need at 1am after a long flight. Fast and tastey. Use to go there a lot 6 years ago so we were pleased it was still there. Staff friendly and beer cold!

Nice food, typical street food style outdoor dining. Popular with locals and visitors alike. Ate a bit of everything over a few nights, just couldn't go any of the frog meals....great spot, friendly and well priced. Note: No credit cards accepted.
5
Simple yet very satisfying. Tasty barbecued stingray and seafood. Will definitely return to this place!

Believe me i don't usually bother to write bad reviews but this is to prevent innocent victims from falling prey to overpriced, unfresh food. Also please don't think all zi-char places are like this. Chilli crab was $85 per KG, meat tasted like it was soaked in SALT water!!!!!! The sweet thai chilli chicken was cold and bland!!! The mee goreng portion was appallingly tiny. Any glory days it had is GONE! I say this with a capital N NEVER come here. Good grief. As a foodie AND singaporean this place is a disgrace to all food establishments!

The food standard here has been very consistent. The seafood is also quite fresh. I would recommed you to come here and then hunt other food nearby. The whole stretch of road has lots of different food nearby.

I have been eating at this amazing restaurant several times alone or with family/friends but I keep forgetting writing an Amazing review for this restaurant. By far Sin Hoi Sai Eating House deserves a Micheline star. At a mid-range price with big servings it is a good place for any form of dining or any types of events. Aside from its Seafood specialty this restaurant also caters other main courses like chicken and pork. The restaurant is a few blocks away from Katong i12 along East Coast Road in the cultural and hip district of Katong. Away from the crowded tourist traps this area serves mostly locals, tourists and expats living here in SG. There are outdoor tables as well as option for indoor with aircondition and toilet if you prefer and if it rains. The staff are very friendly, hospitable, attentive and courteous - though some speak little English. Mode of payment is cash only so please prepare for cash at hand. Beer is also served for those who love it to pair with its delicious and sumptuous fried rice, barbecues, and most specially seafood - they serve wide range from Crabs, Shrimps, Seashells, and different varitiies of Fishes. I always order the Yang Chow Fried Rice, Lala (Clam) sauteed in Garlic and Onion Springs, and the Steamed Fish (Snapper) in Black Bean Sauce - which is by far the most succulent steamed fish I've ever tasted rivaling those top Michelin starred Chinese restaurant - fresh, succulent, decadent. All in all we are a family of four and the cost is just around 70 dollars plus 2 beers. This is the best outside dining serving Hong Kong cuisine at its finest here in Singapore. Please do visit it - recommended :=

The missus and I are here once every couple of weeks. The extensive menu of Singaporean and Asian staples is consistently good, and the packed open air tables of happily families and large groups of friends are testament to that.We're particular fans of the stingray smothered in a tasty sambal sauce, Indonesian chicken, seafood gyoza, any of the veg - they're always fresh, green and crunchy, never soggy. We're tofu fans and there are a couple of good sizzling tofu dishes on offer, I recommend you give those a try too.They serve frozen Tiger beer which is a bit weird, kind of slush puppy like for a minute, but eating at the outdoor tables sorts that out pretty quickly.Sin Hoi San deserves it's place as the no.1 family favourite in JooChiat and having written this review, I know where I'm going for dinner tonight

On a recommendation from a local East Coast resident – a strong recommendation, mind you – we decided to dine at Sin Hoi Sai Eating House in Katong. We are thankful for the recommendation as we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience.Note that there is also a Sin Hoi Sai Seafood Restaurant in Tiong Bahru which is presumably part of the same organisation. Interestingly, the Tiong Bahru restaurant is not rated as well as the Katong branch.On arrival, we discovered that the restaurant has a wide range of seafood and local Singaporean dishes on menu. It turned out to be quite a task simply deciding what to order. Every dish sounded nice. To our delight, every dish we ordered was delicious. Service was fine, with our food being served promptly (albeit this was early on a weekday evening when the restaurant was only half occupied).Note that this is an eating house like a kopitiam, i.e. open at the front towards the street. It is a plastic chair, formica table and fans turning at maximum speed type of place. So do not expect an indoor air-conditioned restaurant. As far as we were concerned, no problem as we love that sort of place; provided the food is good. And it was!East Coast Road is a busy thoroughfare so the ambient noise is elevated, even without people chatter. Tables are available inside and outside under the awning or in the open. Recommendations: (1) Book a table, especially for Friday and weekend nights. (2) If you are averse to sitting near the road and prefer a quieter spot, book an indoor table.(3) If you have a special occasion requiring a quieter restaurant, go elsewhere.(4) Early evening before the crowds is a good time to dine.This restaurant caters for small and large groups, and opens from 4:30pm till 4am daily.5-stars for the food, 4-stars for value, 3-stars for service and 1-star for the noisy road-side atmosphere, so say an average of 4-stars.Thanks for reading this review and my gratitude should you rate it as helpful. No pressure though...Life is short. Make your plans today and go travelling and makaning! Enjoy Singapore and its food

Value for money . Foods are really delicious.Service is excellent.When you are in Singapore you should come to visit.
3
I keep passing this place and I see it is always crowded. We decided to try it for dinner one night. The food was decent. Nothing to rave about it. The service was a bit slow.
4
I have eaten at this place for many years, its always busy which has to be testament to the great food served here. The staff are great, they never stop, and its true to say, it's service with a smile. Well recommended.
5
Great place to have Dinner with family & friends ! Sin Hoi Sai Restaurent in Katong area offers many yummy dishes to satisfy everyone's tastebuds! It's always advisable to call to reserve a table if you are going there in a group, be warned it's always crowded with all races!
5
There's no shortage of restaurants in East Coast, but Sin Hoi Sai is one of the better ones. It can get extremely crowded so food can take up to an hour at around 8-10pm, so be prepared or go early or go later. Staff are busy but friendly and you'll find a mix of locals and foreigners eating here. A unique feature is that you can bring your own wine and they will provide wine glasses
5
Ten of us had dinner there last evening and none of us wasn't disappointed.Such flavourful food...Orders were taken by the owner...affectionately called "Aunty" ...who somehow made sure she had the time for every patron. Despite it being full, the service was excellent. We sat inside in the air-conditioning and that was such a blessing.Wonderful experience
5
Stayed in Singapore for one night, restaurant was close to the hotel. Decided in eating here as was busy and proved popular. Food was amazing, we had the sweet and sour pork with rice and fried vegetables, food was hot and good standard. The place itself is basic, plastic tables and chairs with some plastic stalls. It's all open plan with ceiling fans and no air conditioning which is part of the attraction. We ordered a beer and a bottle water, beer was cold but the water was tepid. Toilet facilities are basic, i.e. a hole in the floor. If your looking for a restaurant for a quiet meal, this is not it, if your looking for an authentic Singapore street restaurant with local character then this is the one.
5
Probably one of the best local restaurants I have been to. Not only was the food tasty, the service was prompt and efficient; but this place was run very very well. Toilets were very clean and upon observing the staff they were all very well trained and ensured top efficiency and cleanliness! Full marks to Aunty in the green blouse
1
Went with the family total four of us.. last Sunday ...no proper order taking. ..place is full. ..no body knows what is happening. .We placed an order with old lady. .Thereafter waiting waiting. .We asked waiters and same lady about the order. ..no clue. ..After one hour we got up to leave. .Our table was given to another family that was waiting. .Ridiculous. 
4
I did a food tour near here and the guide recommended this place too. Had lovely BBQ stingray, pork ribs cooked in Guinness, calamari, venison, fried rice, veggies....all delicious and I loved it. It was busy and full of locals which is always a good sign. It's easy to get to and I would happily go there again next time I'm in Singapore
1
Long waiting for the food. Crab costs S$80/kg which is very expensive for Zhi Char standard. Each diner costs S$40+ per person for a dinner meal consists of kang kong belancha, fried taufu, pepper crab (1 crab only), spare ribs and one bottle of beer
5
I was introduced to this place by my brother-in-law who is a local . Since then my husband and I make it a point to visit this place every time we go to Singapore .
3
Seafood like most middle level eating houses on the streets of Singapore. Not disappointing but not spectacular either
4
We have eaten here numerous times in the last 12 months. Food consistently good, service efficient, ambience always relaxed. Recommend if in the area. Remember it's cash only though! There is an ATM across the road. A definite family favourite.
4
When we lived in Singapore, this was one of our regular places, as the food was great, the prices were cheap and the staff were friendly. On a revisit, nothing has changed. We managed to get a table outside at the back, which sheltered us from a brief rain storm. The Tiger beers arrived immediately. We had a variety of meats and vegetable dishes, which were excellent. Many of the older staff are the same - always attentive and friendly. A great street experience
4
I've been coming to this roadside eating house for years. There is a wide ranging menu offering local Chinese Singaporean dishes, as well as many generic Asian standards. Service is brisk and friendly, so there is a high turnover of tables. It stays busy well into the night, so there are many others who think the same as I
4
When all the shops are closed way passed midnight, you can trust Sin Hoi Sai to have the perfect fried rice for your supper cravings even if it's passed 2am. (Which is what I did tonight to take away and enjoy it with my wife)Another highly recommended supper snack will be their fried har chiong chicken (or fried prawn paste chicken) Sadap! Delicious! Oishi
4
We live in the neighbourhood and will pop by once a month for dinner. No air conditioning nor WIFI, and cash-only basis. However the food is consistently good (if you order the house specialities and crowd favourites) and service decent. It's fuss free and reliable. No corkage should you choose to bring your own wine, but this sort of food ought to be consumed with Tiger beer or the house brewed local non-alcoholic drinks, which is the more usual local practice.
4
Great friendly open dining inside or out. Food is consistently good.... but nothing really jumps out as fantastic. Fast and efficient service. Love the family atmosphere, plastic chairs and tables but clean. The best thing is the no corkage, allow BYO wine and give you an ice bucket and glasses ... great stuff 
4
We were returning from the city and didn't note that the clock was already past 10 pm. We still needed dinner, and most restaurants on the street were already closed. By luck we got of the bus at this place and saw it was open and still crowded with locals.We got served quickly and the food was delicious. The owner of the place since 35 years(!) served us and helped us pick the dishes. The bill was also very reasonable for two persons.Would come again and would definitely recommend to visit. If you are staying in the neighborhood you really should try it
4
I was told either the chili or pepper was a must. I had chili and it was fantastic! I agree, a must try if you like crab.
5
Fabulous food,can't be faulted. We have eaten here for about 12 days and the quality doesnt change. Delicious. The staff are wonderful and operate on a constant run. Tiger is always cold. To be recommended.
4
I am sure there would be a number of like places dotted around Singapore but this is close to our hotel. The food is tasty and reliable the beer is cold and the atmosphere fun and lively. We have had the grilled sting ray a couple of times now and it is always good. We have now added the Indonesian chicken to the must have list along with the kang Kong. Not sure if I would go out of your way to get here but if you are staying local give it a try
5
An institution in Katong, most taxis will know where it is. Open till late, and crowded especially on the weekends. A really long menu, replete with pictures for tourists if they stand on uncertain ground with local food. Agree with a previous review that Shark's Fin being offered on the menu is a black mark, but i must say that i did not see anyone order it - perhaps only a matter of time before the owners realise that it is so passÃ© to continue offer Share's Fin. Simple atmosphere, don't expect a/c or tablecloths - but perhaps the best Singapore food is to be found in such places
5
When we visit from the UK always eat here at least once exceptional food and service have never been disappointed. The marmite chicken is fantastic. Also love the flat beef noodles really different to anything we have tasted in Singapore. Been back this evening and first class food great atmosphere good prices.5 stars in every visit
2
This place is by far way too overrated, given the fact that it has lots of customers. Ordered the steamboat soup with a base price of $24 and with choice of fish slices added in, the price will skyrocket according to seasonal prices. They have BBQ chicken wings/stingray/sotong. Ordered the sotong option at $8 a plate and was utterly disappointed with the outcome. Came on a small plate cooked with fried pork lard, which is a first for me as my experience by far tells me it is served on banana leaf and the serving is quite generous with sambal. But this, its like being stir fried with chili oil and truth be told, i counted only about no more than 10 pieces. So, for about 10 pieces at a cost of $8, i am not sure how would one assume the worthy affordability. Would be better off dining at other zi char stalls
4
We really enjoyed our prawn dish - huge king prawns cooked in the shells & you can eat the shell as it's so thin. Adds a lovely texture to the sweet prawn meat. A plate of beautifully cooked mushrooms on top of Asian greens + a plate of fried rice...delicious! Nice cold Tiger beer too. Prices were good for Singapore. Service inattentive especially when we had finished and wanted the bill...no eye contact can be made even though we were early and only 1 other table. They were all too busy talking or day dreaming. Needed to call out across the room to get attention. Such an easy thing to improve on but wonder if they will
4
Got told about here by local, worth us doing 2 train and 1 bus from where we were, my Gf had the local Chilli Crab, sucked the shell empty, I ventured for 3 cup chicken and small portion of fried rice, big enough that I couldn't eat it al
3
We wanted to try this restaurant since long since it catered to both seafood and vegan lovers. The restaurant is pretty crowded on the weekends and it would be good if you reach here early. The overall food is good, however, it took almost an hour for the staff to prepare the food we had ordered which is quite bizarre since we didn't order anything out of the regular
4
I have been going to this restaurant since 1998. Left Singapore in 2008 & still goes there whenever I'm back in Singapore. Have also recommended it to many friends. Everybody has only good words for this restaurant in terms of quality, taste & the staff. All I want to say is, go try them & experience it yourself
5
I just love this restaurant. We go there every time we go to Singapore..The food is excellent, the beer is always cold and the outside atmosphere is great. Don't leave without trying their marmite chicken.
5
Recommended dishes- Indonesian chicken, fried fish and golden fried batter prawns. The atmosphere is lively with the owners taking really good care of all the folks. I keep visiting this place once every month.
5
It has been years since I last came here and I must say the ambience is still the same after these 30+years. Ordered the salted egg prawns, Guinness pork ribs, yee kwong hor fan, deep fried squid, prom fret and many others for a table of twelve. One of east coast's favorite eateries and reasonably priced.
4
Dined here with a friend's family. At first, I was slightly doubtful of the quality given the outdoor seating and quality of the cutlery. However, once the food arrived, I realized why this tiny place is so crowded. We had ordered chicken noodles, dimsums and one sting ray dish. Never had sting ray before. The old lady (probably owner or manager) who was taking the orders was very patient and suggested some good dishes.
4
We have tried the black pepper crab and mee goreng. The crab was about 1.2 kg which was good enough for two of us. We were seated outdoor but it wasn't that hot as daytime. I also ordered barley water which was a prefect match for having spicy food.Many people might have suggested to have seafood at other places (located in the attraction spots or far away in the resident area, you know what I referred to)that had made me confused and hard to choose in the first place. I finally chose this one because Mayday had also tried it before. As a matter of fact, I was satisfied by the restaurant for its food, price, environment and location (only 15 mins bus from city centre)
5
Went here after a visit to a friend nearby. The place was very basic, staff were efficient and food was authentic local. Please bring cash and tissues. Indonesian chicken was good, fried you tiao with mayonaise was also good. Beer was cold. Taxis frequently pass by. Wish this was my local eatery.
5
Sin Hoi Sai Eating house has been around for over 20 years and is still one of my favorite places for local food. This place is not about the ambience. It's about the quality food and efficient staff. Be sure to order the chili crab & fish head curry
4
We went there with my mother-in-law and my wife's uncle. The crab was very succulent and meaty, all food was great. Minor points are it's near Tiong Bahru road so it's not quiet (but there is a lively atmosphere so not a problem), also there's no baby changing facilities so you have to use a chair / the stroller if possible if you have a little one in tow.Service was very good despite most staff having a poor command of English.Overall it wasn't cheap (although cheaper than Jumbo's) but well worth it
2
If you want original food, go to one of the many food courts in this neighbourhood, where you eat much better for a third of the price. Terribly fatty food. Tiny pieces of chewy fried squid hidden in large quantities of batter. Same for the Indonesian chicken. Unfriendly staff. Astonishing how many people go there.
5
Going to this restaurant is a very authentic experience: Great local food including Chilli crab, prawns, all kind of meat dishes and veggi. There's something on the menu for everybody. Each dish is around 10 - 15 SGD. A large bottle of beer 7 SGD, which is very reasonable for Singapore.Be aware that the location on tripadvisor is not correct - the adress is 187 East Coast Road, opposite side of the "Church of the Holy Family"
5
When ever i visit Singapore i make it a point to eat at Sin Hoi Sai Eating house. Awesome food. Though My fav is SAMBAL CHICKEN FRIE DRICE extra spicy but its a nice place to have sea food too.
3
This place have managed to maintain their standards quite well.
On the average most of the dishes I order were from average to good.
Hope it is not because of MSG.
Worth coming here to try.
4
Very reasonable priced crab $60.00 & plenty for 2 people to share. Also had some greens & salt & pepper pork which where delicious! Dining isn't 5 star, but very clean, comfortable & great experience.
3
Lots of great dishes on the menu at this no frills place, so best to go with a big group to be able to try more. Don't bring too much money because it's not expensive at all...
4
On a layover in Singpaore we longed for seafood, so decided on this place that was near our hotel. Tables are outside, and the staff does not speak English, so the owner helped us with our order, Be aware that "Market Price" equates with expensive. Given the lack of ambience, prices seemed high for seafood. You are better to order dishes with a price; they are a much better value, even if they contain seafood. The grilled fish was overdone. The prawns were swimming in a tank: several leapt onto the floor and obviously ended up on our plates, but were cooked perfectly. Tiger beer was reasonably priced. Given our limited time, it worked out o.k. 4 dishes with 5 large Tiger beers worked out to $140 SGD with tip
3
This price although not cheap but to have nice zichar fare at East coast road. There isn't much to compare. The small portion is really small portion. The recommended dish to try is;1. Indonesia fried chicken 2. Pork rib King 3. Sanlao horfan4. Caipu stream Sea BassAverage price per person is about S$14-20They have live seafood to choose too.Advisable to call for reservations to avoid long wait
2
We live around the corner from the East Coast Road Sin Hoi Sai (not the Tiong Bahru one) and have dined there several times over the past three years with mixed results.But unfortunately my most recent visit was so disappointing there was no choice but to write this review.DO NOT go here unless you hate your wallet and you want to purge it of all its contents!I only grabbed a basic takeaway meal - medium marmite ribs and a small stir-fried Dou Miao veggie (i.e. a greener, more tender version of bean sprouts).The marmite ribs were so, so disappointing - we've had it before on dining-in but this was another thing altogether. Would you ever consider serving a chilli crab without chilli sauce, or a chicken rice without chicken essence in the rice?Well this was marmite ribs without the marmite. Who do they think they're fooling?The telltale sign was in the ribs' complexion. Instead of the usual blackish tinge indicating the presence of a sweet marinade, it was more of a tanned brown colour similar to fried hokkien noodles. Instead of marmite, the ribs appeared to be braised in a basic sweet / honey sauce that could not have been on the stove for any more than fifteen minutes, so chewy and tough it was. Not your usual slide-off-the-bone-and-swallow affair.And certainly not worth the $15 for nine measly, under-cooked ribs! If this was the medium-size ribs, then small-size customers, PREPARE TO GO HUNGRY.I could've gone next door to Boon Tong Kee and had four full servings of tender chicken rice for the same price (which I would've done, if not for the fact I'd had Boon Tong Kee for lunch on the same day).Now, the Dou Miao (i.e. pea sprouts). This was a little more passable but still not up to scratch. Some of the sprouts were fibrous and chewy like two-week-old cai xin that you spit out after chewing and extracting the juice from it. It's definitely not fresh, and at $8 a pop, it's certainly not designed to fill empty stomachs unless it's accompanied with a thousand other dishes.The disappointing thing about Sin Hoi Sai is its reputation betraying its quality. The hype and fanfare surrounding it almost obliges people to rock up and shower praises on it for its local feel and its clamorous, al fresco atmosphere. Just look at all the positive reviews it continues to receive. But look closely, and you will notice that most of its customers are non-locals who are there more for the beer than the food.Don't be fooled by the reviews - go in with your eyes wide open
4
Great family Chinese restaurant in Tiong Bahru district!Don't expect anything fancy though, but food is good and restaurant is clean.We ordered their famous Chili Crab which was amazing! Lots of gravy and they served it with a generous portion of fried buns.Other items were very good too, although the winner hands down was the crab!Bring a big group of friends (at least 4 or 5) to really enjoy the food and variety
4
With a long list of my favourite Asian dishes on the menu, it proved difficult to decide, so we ordered quite a range of meals... all delicious! Interesting too, to view an exceptional collection of crustaceans, molluscs and fish in large aquaria, waiting to be freshly prepared and served. Prices are reasonable and service attentive, but we'd have liked to have had some of our orders a little earlier.I'd recommend you include Prawn Paste Chicken, Kuay Teow and a green spinach-like vegetable similar to Vietnam's Morning Glory. What a feast!
4
I had often passed by this bustling street restaurant in Katong, and felt that it must be good given that it was always crowded.I went with my wife and son, and although we had to wait a while for the food (it was all freshly cooked) it tasted and looked great. Well worth the trip
4
If you don't like crowded places, Sin Hoi Sai serves excellent spicy crabs without the long lines. We had dinner on a week night so that might have helped too.
5
Not fancy, basic plastic chairs and simple tables outside and inside. But fabulous fresh seafood, I think the best black pepper crab and chili crab in Sing. Try the slated egg crayfish, to die for. Really, for informal dining and the best seafood you have eaten in a long time, come here
4
Really good Singaporean Chinese food. It is essentially outdoors but in the back there is some air con. Ate there twice this week once with a friend and once alone. Got decent but not rapid service pretty much what you get anywhere in this type of eating place in Singapore. Menu has pictures and they have different sized portions which allows you to try more dishes. For reviewers who complained...I and my dinner companion are not Chinese. There are a lot of places that look like this one, but the food here is especially good. Cereal shrimp, seafood dumplings, oops, getting hungry
5
Sin Hoi Sai is located in residential area on Tiong Bharu road, the nearest MRT is Outram park but need to take bus for a few bus stop. So it is not that convenient for tourist but it is not to hard to reach. We always come back to Singapore for Signature Chili crab and Sin Hoi Sai (at Tiong Bharu) is the restaurant that we always come and recommend friends and relatives to come. Chili crab is a must tried dish. And the other plates is also fresh and yummy. Price wise is normal Singapore restaurant rate 
3
Good food but EVERYTHING costs. We were trying to economize, ordered carefully, and the bill was a whopping 50 percent above our calculations. We asked for an explanation & were given an accounting in Chinese, changing for tap water, paper napkins used, condiments, and a surcharge because it was close to New Year
1
Friend´s brought me here. Had I known there was shark fin soup on the menu I would have found a way to eat some where else, as I don´t support business who support shark finning. If you don´t either now you know they serve it!The place it´s self was fun. I enjoyed sitting out side, it was very relaxed. The staff were very friendly and helpful helping me out with veggi options. We had a nice evening. I just hope they can research about the horrendous act shark finning is, both to the sharks and to the oceans and take it off the menu. If they do I´ll happily go back
4
I've been going here for years. Prices have gone up, but the range and quality of this classic Singaporean eating house keep it in the top league. Roadside eating on the busy East Coast Road in Katong may not be for everyone, but this is a great place, always busy, always good. Nothing fancy, but good.I have seen many regulars here over the years, so I guess it's not just me who thinks this is a good place to eat again and again
5
It has become one of my favorite food joint in Singapore. Simple indoor & outside sitting. Good personalized service by Lady Owner Khim. Excellent Cilli & Paper Crabs with buns & Tiger beer is my most favorite here. You can choose Crabs, Lobsters, Prawns ect from live stock fish tanks. You can also try best Pork chops. Ajay
3
I wanted to try more food dishes here but with just the two of us, it was more food than we could eat or afford. Afford? The live seafood in tanks can be pretty expensive and are priced by the pound. This is a better place to have dinner with a large group of people to share the meal. Or two very hungry people, which we weren't. lol. We had my favorite go-to chinese food: Fried rice w/ chicken and salted fish (very good), Fried fish skin (very good, like a fishy chicharron) and the fried shrimp (not so good. It had ground pork in it and my hubby doesn't eat ground meat -- he read the menu too quickly). While the staff is very attentive, they are less than patient if you are just asking questions. They are all focuses in taking your order quickly and methodologically. Which can be good for people who know what they want. It was a quiet night and there were few families. I can't remember if we were there just outside peak dining hour
5
When we livd in Singapore we camemhere omce a week. Now on a vitis for yours later ... It was still the same: simple delicious Simgapore-Chinese food. The owner lady still remembered us. We had our favorites: sting ray, sambal kang kong, baby squid, tofu,.... and loved it.It is also good for people watching and has a bus station right in front
5
I actually came here when I wasn't that hungry, but just wanted a bite to eat. The Tiger beer with the fried pork and garlic - it was outstanding. Highly recommend.
5
Awesome food and very popular for the local middle-upper class. Not expensive. Good food with beer. Friendly owner!!! Will definitely go back and eat again
4
It's a quaint little place on the street (like you see in the movies) not a walk in restaurant type. I would not ordinarily choose it as a dinner place, however our hosts in SGP suggested in. The food was great, esp the cereal prawns. Sweet and sour chicken was also a winner. Fun time out
5
I have been taking clients and family to this restaurant for years and I still rate it as my favourite. The owner and staff are very friendly and attentive and the food is alway good. One of my favourite starters is the prawn paste chicken, they do it better than any other restaurant. Their black pepper crab is my favourite main
4
Went with my wife last on the way to the movies. Fantastic food especially the Guinness ribs (v tender, beautifully marinated) baby Kailan w oyster sauce and salted prawns (crisp) good friendly service and the waitress laughed at my bad Mandarin. Met the owner who said they'd been there 32 years and was all smiles and very engaging. A very nice vibe about the place and great to watch the world go by
5
The restaurant, located in Tiong Bahru near the famous Tiong Bahru Market, claims to offer exotic seafood and uniquely Singaporean cuisine, but that is an understatement. It should say: The BEST exotic seafood and uniquely Singaporean cuisine for a more thgen acceptable price. I've had the chance to try many different restaurants but this one offers superbly fresh and well prepared gourmet experiences like steamed bullfrog, fried rice with silver fish, or the double cooked pork, just to name a few. Sin Hoi Sai is also frequented by local celebrities despite the many many other top quality seafood restaurands in the city so I think that's a good sign..
5
Really one of the best places in singapore to have a hearty meal with friends, as I did with mine! The fish head curry was finger licking good so be prepared to have more than one bowl of rice. And MUST try the aloe vera drink, its cool and refreshing and the chunks of aloe vera are massive! They prepare fresh aloe vera at the store themselves so its a gem you can't find easily on drink menus around the island. Loved my dinner there- fantastic
5
Whilst visiting family in Singapore we were treated to a meal at their favourite local restaurant, Sin Hoi Sai known to them as 'Aunties' due to the very friendly and welcoming owner. All of the food was wonderful but the pepper crab was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was wonderful and Sin Hoi Sai will definitely be my first stop for my next visit to Singapore

One of the things I love most about Singapore is the variety and access to different food and culture.After a trawl Monday night looking for one of the expat style restaurants in the east coast a friend and I thought we would give it a go.We ended up having a brilliant feed and a few bottles of beer on the pavement... The place is exactly what you would expect with no illusions, the service, presentation and quality of food is exactly what you would expect for a place spilling out onto the street like this and I hope we don't lose places like this in favour of more anonymous expat restaurants.

I was fortunate to partake of much food and much Tiger beer at this open-5pm-to-5am eating establishment. We had the century egg, delicious with its gelatinous green "white" and curdled yolk. This was followed by mushrooms and asparagus (spicy), a flat beef dish and chicken soup with pig stomach to add flavor and texture; the broth was great. This was followed by both chilli crab and pepper crab. I thought that the chilli crab was too sweet and wasn't spicy enough but the pepper crab was wonderfully spicy and flavorful with its black sauce. We finished up with some soy noodles that were perfectly prepared. Deserves good marks for service and fantastic food. Don't know the price but am told that it is extremely affordable as well

Ate here twice and found the food to be authentic but was not cheap for local food.
The tables were always full here and was very popular with the locals.
Honest food, cold beer.

Loved the food. The chilli crab was fantastic. We loved the street food atmosphere! Looking forward to going back in the future.

This is a Zhi Char (cook to order) local food experience. My husband and I eat there at least 2 times every week. It is a small family business, very attentive staff, great service and value for money. A must try in Singapore!

My freind brought me here for a local Singaporean food for dinner in tiong bahru area. This local place overall is worth a visit. First its taste for food including our try for glory morning fried in singapore style, fried squid, eggplants hotpot, and fried rice are all very tasty and delicious. The taste is so perfectly balanced with salty sweet sour and hot and is much better than most Chinese food i have in singapore and malaysia in this style. Second the variety of food in menu is so impressive and offers many menu items with good picture. Third its location will blend you with the nostalgic feeling to walk into the past of Singapore given this area is a perfectly preserved area roe historic buildings and also just 10 mins to orchard road central area and just next door to the famous hawker food centre tiong bahru

Great food, and no attempts to be a restaurant that they're not, it's honest, it's not plush or elegant. No white linen napkins, just good tasty food at a great price. A great place to go with friends who are not looking to be impressed with the latest in fashionable artistry

I'm a regular at Sin Hoi Sai for many years now. I'm also a vegetarian and there's a lot this place can offer. Few things to recommend would be the sambal chicken fried rice, curry mutton, dried chilli chicken and sambal kankong, not to mention all of it being vegetarian! The main guys (Aunty/Uncle) knows what's required in a strict vegetarian diet (eggs/no eggs) as many Indians visit this place. Even though it's a little pricey, I would most definitely recommend this place for anyone who's a Chinese-vegetarian cuisine lover.It's open till really late. Service may get a little slow sometimes due to almost all tables being filled up, but you'll get what you need eventually as the crew do their best to attend to everyone. It's also easy to find as it's a 5 min walking distance from i12 Katong or Parkway Parade.Really awesome place! Go Sin Hoi

Seems like even more tourists have found this eatery, based on the diners, though this is still a favourite with the locals. They have the usual wok fried dishes, including sweet and sour pork, sambal kangkong and baby squid. It can get crowded at times, but our meals usually take around an hour or less. Its easy to find, being opposite Katong Catholic church and OCBC Bank. Parking can be a problem here though

We waited a long time to get a waitress then gave our order to a Lady who had to be interrupted by other servers several times. After she left we again waited and finally another waitress came over and took our order again. Then I they brought food we did not order and we did tell them--some left and some taken. After a long wait, one got a meal, then after about 10 minutes 2 others got their orders. The last order did not come for about 30 minutes after several requests. the of the dinners were ok at best but the fourth was horrible/unedible. We had a difficult time getting a waitress to assist us. NOTE: no assigned waitress. We finally asked for a check several times. After another 15 minutes or more with the main waitress raising her finger as if to say I will be with you, we stood up. After she continued to walk by us I stood up and said --Hey very stern. After that another waitress brought a bill over. We told her about the one very poor meal which had not been eaten and her response was if you ordered it then it is not our problem so we paid and left. Very poor service and food quality was not good even for 3 meals that we could eat. Imagine the rice was not tasty. We did notice that other customers were waited on in a more timely manner. If you are a tourist, do not try this place. First review I have ever been motivated to write

Try the chilicrab, in fact you can problaby eat everything they got on the meny!It is very busy but you get your drinks and food without waiting long!
5
Great service, friendly staff, awesome food, will be back ASAP. Food came out like a rocket and top up beers were flawless, my first was the sting ray, must have tastes like chicken and love the chili sauce
5
It looks shabby and you sit next to the street, but the food is really amazing, whatever you take a success! I can strongly recommend that place!

Unless you like mass chaos, overpriced and lousy food,stay away from this place. If you plan on ordering and don't know Chinese you are in trouble. Try waiting 20 minutes before they pay any attention to tables who are not of Chinese descent. We were a party of four but after what seemed lik forever,only three meals arrived. After another 20 minutes our rice finally arrived with the fourth meal.Waitresses literally run and shout. I narrowly missed having a tray of food dumped down my back. After our disgusting meal, we were once again ignored in our attempt to get a bill to pay, until we raised our voices to the same decibel as theirs. I'm now back at the hotel with a very sore stomach!In sum, STAY AWAY!

Went here with my wife, having been recommended by friends. We lived in Singapore for 5 years and somehow failed to find this fantastic place! Welcomed by Aunty who helped us with the menu and got the Tiger Beers flowing. We had sweet and sour pork, garlic fish, cereal prawns "not in uniform", and variety of greens. All served promptly, hot and absolutely delicious. You cannot beat street food for value for money, plus watching locals. Definitely now our favorite East Coast street food place

Fantastic place to eat! Why pay top dollar at a water front (rip-off) restaurant when you can enjoy the quality food at Sin Hoi Sai? Great atmosphere, great food, highly recommended. Our family went their for dinner and went straight back two nights later. Service is immediate and friendly. Food is so yummy! Marmite chicken is a mus
5
Went on a quick stopover in Singapore as it was behind our hotel. Ordered a range of things from the menu; all came when cooked and piping hot. The sizzling beef was especially good, as was the watercress and pork soup.Service was friendly and the beer was ice cold. More than we could both eat with 2 large beers came in at SGD50 which is excellent value.Chinese food where the locals eat. How Singapore should be
5
As this restaurant is only metres away from my hotel and I had already read good reviews I decided to see for myself. Fabulous is the word to describe the food at Sin Hoi Sai. From the wonderfully cheap (by Singapore standards) Tiger beer to the range of freshly cooked dishes to the helpfulness of the staff, this place is wonderful. We ate here three nights running, trying new dishes each time. Nothing disappointed. The restaurant is always busy but no one is turned away, a table will be found for you, even if it means extending the dining area along the street

Fantastic food ... express service but ... the flavour and texture of the chilli crab was out of this world (esp with the deep fried rolls to mop up the sauce- papara??)The crab made the bill a bit steep but it was worth it. and we'll be back for more of the starters tomorrow
5
simple: you can go to Jumbo and have a great crab, no doubt. if you want to try something less touristy and more original, try this one. the crab (and I "only" had one whole crab for myself with black pepper sauce) is sensational. The only time I like to get my fingers dirty.service is casual, look is who cares, but the food experience worth it. YUM, I'll come again, thank you
5
Black Pepper Crub, Morning Glory, and Fried Curry are my favorite.
5
I went here with my wife and it being our first trip to Singapore we had to order the Chili Crab! It was so delicious, words cannot begin do describe how good it was. It is also very messy though, so be sure to bring extra tissues or wet wipe

Back in the US now, after spending four years in Singapore. Would eat here at least twice a week and we miss it badly. Ask for Joe - he works 365 days a year.Great food and, if you stay away from the chilli crab (one of the most over-rated dishes in Singapore) it's very inexpensive. The buttered prawns will be enough to bring you back time and time again, but also try the Indonesian chicken, baby kailan, sweet and sour pork, Hong Kong noodles and the grilled sea bass is magnificent.Plastic chairs, plastic tables, plastic plates and plastic chop sticks, but the best food in Singapore.By the way, Joe is also an English Premier League afficionado

I have been living in Singapore over 2 years, have visited Sin Hoi San 3 times. The food is good but every time I go the food gets more expensive. Last time I went we payed over $170 for 2 people!!! I felt they just charged us what they felt like because we are expats. The food is good but not enough to pay that much! There are many other great seafood places in Singapore that won't make you feel you are being robed

For a vegetarian like me, i m always hesistant to walk into chinese food courts as most of them dont serve pure vegetarian food. But to my surprise, as this places is always flooded and many indians visit the place, the auntie over there understands indian vegetarian and once you order you can tell them not to put in meat,egg other ingredients...i love the thai tofu, fried rice and other veggeies side dishes. Top up your drinks from beer to cokes...enjoy the meal and the good thing is the place is open thru the midninght.Enjoy
4
Eat here fairly often. The BBQ Stingray is a favorite with the spicy dip. That is a must. Try also the wok cooked beef flat noodles (beef hor fun) with gravy. Always good. Food works well with lime juice or a nice home made barley drink. Worth the trip. Price is okay
4
I've been dining at Sin Hoi Sai for many years now. Not many people are aware of it's large vegetarian menu. Being a strict vegetarian this is my go-to to get my fix of mock sweet and sour chicken and other Singaporean delights. It's a truly Singaporean experience to eat here. Although it is pricey, I still would recommend it. It stays open till late and the food has been consistent for many years

My friends love seafood a lot..so we decided to go to a special place for eating the seafood.And we heard other people suggested to go to this restaurant, we knew it would be expensive. But, we decided to try it..especially the famous dish ~~ crab.We ordered Chilli Crabs, Deep Fried Mandu, Stir-Fired Noodles, Stir-Fried Vegetables and Singapore Beer ~ Tiger Beer.The chilli crab was delicious, especially with the sauce!! But, this dish is not the most impressive dish to me...the most impressive dish was the stir-fried noodles...the flavour was really good....the noodles not too soft or too hard.;.it was not easy...when you overcooked the noodles...the noodles would be too soft and sticky...like porridge..And then it was the Tiger Beer..I'm not a alcholic...but, I like the taste of it..not too strong but it just refreshing...It was the perfect match with the chilli crab and noodles!!Overall, the food was good..but the service was poor..the waitress didn't have any patience to serve you...you need to wait for a long time to get someone to respond...and when you want to ask something...they didn't want to answer.... I hope the restaurant owner could pay attention to this problem...even your food is good..but with the poor service...it really affect your shop's image

Ask for Joe.Sit down. He will pour you Heineken until you drop. Let him order for you:Baby KailanIndonesian ChickenGuiness Pork RibsSeafood RiceCereal PrawnetcYou will be amazed by the food. We go here about twice a month from Australia and never disappointe

One of the better places for local food in Singapore serving one of the best and cheapest che-zar dishes in the country. Service is good despite the excellent business enjoyed by the place, daily. Offers a great variety of food at cheap prices, this place also allows free BYO wine and provides wine glasses ;) great place for wine aficionados who hate paying silly corkage fees.Must tries are the grilled seabass - sambal, pig trotter bee hoon, drunken chicken in claypot, watercress soup, crispy noodles with seafood, whole fish soup (steamboat style) and many many more.....
5
We had several meals here and always the food was great. Cold beer and good value. My pick, the quiness pork ribs. We will be back next time in Singapore
5
This dish was so incredible good. With had a lot of dishes that night: fried chicken (so simple but so good) fried rice, prawns, large clams, steamed grouper and fried grouper in soy and salted egg crab, my favorite!
This place delivers!

This is my local favorite spot. My husband and I come here practically every weekend, and bring every visitor here at least once during their stay. Mostly, food is homey but good. Service can be all over the place depending on how busy they are, but aunty is very friendly and always looks after us. I always get a pepper crab because I LOVE crab, but their chili crab is not the best I've had. Their indonesian chicken is awesome - we ask for it to be done without bones and they come fried like chicken popcorn. Not the best thing for you but really delicious and we can't help but to order it when we go. I also like their plain ordinary steamed prawns, and their sambal kangkong is also quite consistently good. I love the hustle and bustle of activities here and the local feel this restaurant offers so we just keep coming back

This is not a restuarant (actually an old run-down dingy coffee shop just next to the junction of Lorong 35 Geylang) for those who require impeccable service quality or who expect their food to be served quick.The 'ladies-in waiting' may even appear grumpy. This is the culture. They are probably the chef, Danny Lee's wife or sibling. There is no menu so you need to know what is available. You may not get to eat what you want to eat just because you can afford the notoriously high charges. It also depends on whether they are willing to serve you the food and cook them for you.When you order drinks from their limited range, the ladies may expect you to grab them from the fridge. They serve hot coffee (black or white), tea (black or white) and fresh coconut. They also serve red/white wine (ask and you will know).They serve several tables each night - probably 4 at the max or they cannot cope with the order and their customers come from as near as Japan and as far as the European cities. So, do understand why the food is to die-for.Their must try dish is the crab bee hoon. The chef starts cooking once the order is placed but he cooks one order at a time and the crab needs time to get cooked so that he can extract the essense that he would use to fry the bee hoon.If you are the first customer for the evening (6 p.m.?), you will probably have to wait minutes before you bee hoon is served. If you are the second or third or fourth table, you will probably have to wait until 8.30 p.m.Be patient. Because the chef takes pride in preparing his signature dishes, he needs time. Do NOT pester the person who has taken your orders for they may bark at you for your impatience. Be assured that the food is well worth the wait. I make it a point to ask for extra bee hoon when I place my order. The number of crabs cooked depends on the number of patrons at the table. Each crab bee hoon can cost as much as $130 so be prepared to foot $200 if 2 crabs are cooked for you.Never miss the gong-gong (sea mussle in a shell like a snail's). The super spicy and rich sauce that accompanies the gong-gong is to die for. I always order 1 kg for my wife and me. Use the satay stick that comes together to extract the sea creature before you dip it into the sauce. "Yummy" is a word that does not do justice to the gong-gong but there is no other word to better describe it.Some customers also order the chicken essence frog or the $teamed fi$h though I prefer the black sauce scallops (with shell).So long as you go with the right mindset (seats are placed outside the coffee shop next to the busy Geylang road lighted by 4 feet flourescent lights with no air-conditioning amidst the din generated by passing vehicles and people), you will love the food (though you may be initially shocked by the price). Customers who cannot wait are always advised to avoid patronising the restaurant and if you expect service staff to be like that of a hotel, then please go to one.They do not treat you like a royalty here but the food is fit for a king

Some good eating to be had here. If we fancy a nice local bite out, we come here. A bit more friendliness & understanding between Sin Hoi & 5 Star Chicken Rice would not go amiss. After all it's nice to share lots of different food with friends. But all in all, Highly recommended.
4
They have a few branches, most notably in Katong and Telok Ayer. The food is chi Zhar style and is wholesome, unpretentious and good. Preferably you should dine in a larger group so you can order more dishes to share. Must trys include chilli crab, coffee ribs and mee goreng.

Love the outside feel of the place, and the amazing array of food. I've been eating for over a decade and still love it. My faves: Coffee-flavoured pork ribs (best on the island, always order the large portion!), har cheong (prawn paste) fried chicken, black pepper crab, cereal prawns and sambal kangkong. My hubby loves the claypot liver - I am not a huge liver person (foie gras is a different story). Service is quick, although sometimes they get the portion size wrong (so always check and stand your ground if they get it wrong!) The wah tan hor (hor fun with egg) is not as great as it used to be; it lacks the old 'wok hei'. Also, I've stopped ordering fish here - I find their prices way too high. Not worth it. Still, SHS is my first stop for good food in a non-fussy setting. Perfect for those hot nights when you wanna have some good food and beer while wearing your singlet and flip-flops
4
The place remind me of my childhood days. Eating by the roadside. If anyone remember the drama" Five Foot Way". The horfun is superb. The fried salted egg cuttlefish is out of this world. Seafood fried rice ok. Ask for sambal belachan. Just like mom's cooking. And Aunty Kim( the owner) is one friendly lad
4
This place is popular every night of the week and has a few peak periods each night. I don't know what is best to order here but they do a tasty san lo hor fun. And I have asked for things off the menu before and they were able to make it for me.

I visited Japanese friend of mine staying in Singapore for couple of years by now and she took me to this restaurant which she often takes her clients from Japan. They have great variety of shell fish still alive in water tanks.We had - Long bamboo like shellfish steamed, topped with garlic oil= lovely crunchy texture - Chili prawns, because crab was too big for 2 people= not too hot but got thick sauce with some eggs mixed. Definitely wanna try with crab next time.- Coffee spare ribs= sweet sauce with roasted scent. Nice to have couple of them, not to many- Stinky beans= bitter beans with strong scents. It's either you really like or really dislike. I can take some.Overall food was good and more sophisticated, I enjoyed it especially after having too much humble hawker food for breakfast and lunch.The best part was we could eat on street. They have many tables on the alley (they had kitchen one side of alley and dining the other). We had people passing by, it was hot night, real feeling that I was in Singapore.It was not so pricey for what we had. Seafood is always the most expensive so it was fair. Will definitely come back with more people to have chili crab next time
