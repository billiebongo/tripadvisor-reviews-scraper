This is the only Lor Mee that I'd eat once a week. Go for $3.50 version with fish meat added in :)! The gravy is just right and fried meat balls taste great for a mere $3.50

The food is great. Salted fish is added to the mee and the gravy is thick and tasty. There is always a long queue of diners waiting to buy their food. The price is $3.00 and you get value for your money.
