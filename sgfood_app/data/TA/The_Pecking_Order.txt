From the food to the wine and cocktails, an amazing find. Each experience has been a treat!!! Amazing, wonderful, and stunning at words that just begin to describe the experience!

Best coffee in the area...and at a reasonable place. menu is limited but surprisingly good. Recommend if one is looking for a simple, eclectic Southern European tappas type approach. Dinner and lunch initially seemed a bit expensive but the quality and portions were just right.

Came here for a coffee today after lunch at a nearby restaurant. The cafe has a great interior with a friendly, cosy atmosphere. Food and alcohol is also available and it's probably not a bad place for a drink after work also. I found that the coffee was a little bitter for my liking, but presentation was good and the service very friendly. Tempted to come back to try the lunch menu at some stage

Great service, friendly & polite staffEnjoyed the Seafood Risotto and Lamb Tenderloin (specials and not part of regular menu)Food pricey for the portion size (Soft Shell Crab dish only had half a crab), generally a bit on salty sideTried the Blackforest Mojito - Refreshing and had fresh raspberries, a bit too sweet and not enough mint flavourActual menu was very different compared to what was on the Chope website ('Sharing Plates' section had been removed) Cup had lipstick mar

Having been to The Pecking Order three times before this, I am still pleasantly surprised everytime I come here. From the friendly staff to the nostalgic decor to the sensational food menu, I can always rely on The Pecking Order to start my night the right way! Everything on the menu seems delicious but i must say, the roasted potatoes with truffle oil and blue cheese is out of this world! Even their house wine, a Pierre Jean Merton was a great selection with the menu.Looking forward to many more visits in the future!
