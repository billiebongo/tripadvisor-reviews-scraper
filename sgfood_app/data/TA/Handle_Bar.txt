Went with friends. Regretted. Period. Mosquitos, mediocre food, not even a pleasant lighting. They seemed to have a theme but it somehow lost it in execution.

this place is fantastic, the best steaks in entire of Singapore with an amazing motor bike history décor. the staff ultra friendly and over all good place to drink or eat.

This is a nice place to hang out, with a country feel and a good vibe. It is somewhat in countryside / parkland so very relaxing and easy to reach with a car or motorcycle. Arriving by motorcycle is the real deal as that is what this place is all about. Food is good - American burger and fries style food. The spicy cheesy fries are excellent

We visited with high expectations, but the service level was poor. Of course, we understand that they could be understaffed and busy running around. However, one thing which troubled us was how our meals were delivered. One of our sides came at the end of the meal. That alone was not the issue. It was brought to another table before us even when they came much later. The food is also expensive for average quality. Given that it's about 15 dollars for a low range meal, and it's far away, the food alone was not worth the trip. However, it is a good hangout

Visited the joint with my partner and probably the first thing that we like were the alfresco seating arrangement. Even though the storm were coming, the staff had this giant tent to slide and cover your table in the event of rain. In the end the weather was good and we enjoyed a nice Breeze throughout dinner! Food was really flavourful with much thought into the taste buds for each dish. Service was good and the price was average for western food in Singapore. A real pity that they will be moving next month to gilman barracks. I will miss the sea Breeze and alfresco seating plus not to mention the intricate detail within the bar. Till the next time.

Well some like and some don't and you can't pleased every single soul. Living up n the North and away from the big city, this place is something I could relate to when I feel like having a meaty and hearty meal.If you are a meat eater, please try the Silence of the Lamb. For the price I pay here is as good as those in town but I need not travel all the way when weekends are usually more laid back and you want a good place for food that's close to home.I do agree not every items in the menu are worth the while. But for the Lamb and Steaks they are worth it. Quality is the key word here.And i need not be dressed up too fine to have good food here. That's what I like about this place. Easy and relax

This bar is located next to the Water Adventure under People Association in Sembawang. Though the road to the bar is quiet but it is well lighted and surprisingly there are quite a number of customers at the bar. We had a drink and it is not expensive which I thought is rather reasonable. The name of the bar is taken with a collection of bike handle bars that hangs on top of the bar. Quite a unique collection of wine bottles too. We will go back for food the next time

This bar is popular with expats and their local friends. The sort of folks who don't want to waste their own money being members of the stuffy old British Club etc. It's a relaxed family friendly sort of environment surrounded by tropical vegetation. A very pleasant place to have an evening drink. The food a mixture of "tex-mex" (local interpretation) and local stuff. Not bad, but not exactly gourmet. However, prices are reasonable (a pint of Guinness is $14.50, which is probably a lot less than you'd pay in some other places in Singapore)

I usually don't rate places in my local town, but the service was incredibly poor that I felt inclined to rate. I had asked for a non-alcohol ginger beer as my friend is allergic to alcohol. They gave an alcoholic one and we didn't notice until after my friend had already started to drink it. Not good. They kept forgetting our orders and so we kept needing to remind and the food came out and such random times. The fries too forever (which means they forgot). So we didn't get to enjoy them with the wings. The wings were only so-so and therefore sadly did not make up for the poor service. Lastly, on the bill there were two extra orders we had never ordered, nor received so they had to adjust it. But if we hadn't checked, we would have over paid.

This place is worth going for its quirky design. The founder of the place didn't do things by half. Have you ever seen a pool table that's made from sawn vehicle? And what about blender that's operated using industrial motors? Stools or seats that are made Vespa scooter skirts? It's quite a distance to get there and it's not somewhere that you could hail for a taxi. Thus, this is a place that locals come to. In the evening, the lights that you see reflected from the water is from Johor, Malaysia. The staff that works there are dressed up in tight t-shirts and hot pants that Hooters would be proud of. Food is okay and pricey. It is leaning more towards American comfort food, mostly fried and grilled. That being said, the whole idea of dining here is for its novelty value, and that it delivers in spades! Commendable visi

Great plase, and out of the town. The food and drinks are highly enjoyable, as well as the ride to go there and the calm outdoor area!
4
nice food. value for money. a little bit difficult to guess how to get to it. The place is clean and featured with rider souvenir. Good place to drink, but need to make sure you have a taxi back.
4
Visited friends who brought us here for the great waterside view and good range of food. Staff were helpful and polite, combined with relaxed atmosphere would definitely recommend for those who are looking for a restaurant off the beaten track.

amazing place for riders, definitely not a place if you hate bikes with loud pipes, for me, im a rider and i love every moment of it when harley riders rode in, unique experience with the blender of a motorbike throttle. a good bar to hang out

The venue is not bad, it's hidden deep inside a forest.We chosen the outdoor seat nearest to the sea was windy and chilling when I visit, but sometimes the wind will blow in bad smell but still acceptable as you can see it's opposite JB and you know why it's smelly. Food is very bad, we order the chicken burger, fish & chip and the blossom onion.The one big fried onion cost me 10SGD, it's very special but after few bite you will feel that too oily. The fries is horrible, it's soft and cold and oily. Chicken burger is very dry and hard, my friend complain very tired to chew the dry and hard meat. I order fish & chip, bad chip and the beer batter skin is very hard, I had whole mouth ulcer after I finished the fish.I'd suggest to enjoy the drink there instead eat there

This is an out of the way place for most Singaporeans or visitors to Singapore, but worth the adventure up past Sembawang. Great food and an interesting atmosphere with lots of unusual furniture and fittings. The chilli chicken wings are red hot; too hot for most to finish, but give them a go. Mostly western style (American) food, so probably not what you would normally be looking for in Singapore, but a good experience all the same
5
Went there with some colleagues after work, and I must admit I wasn't expecting something like this.Great decorations all around, very spacious bar, next to the river and facing Malaysia! A nice Breeze, so not hot at all...Food was good, we had various finger food... Good quality! If you like spicy, you'll love there spicy chicken wings!!! I challenge you!!!! The most spicy thing I've ever eaten! Service was excellent!Very nice place to chill out after work

Nice restaurant that has a biker's theme. Location is off and can only be accessible if you drive. Serves American dishes which are so so, fairly forgettable. Service is slow and you are better off helping yourself to the plain water at the bar than wait for someone to serve you
4
The food is ok to me. Not something to shout out loud for. BUT the ambience is unique. Near the sea. You need to eat fast before the sea breeze makes the food cold. Very suitable for family too as there is a lot of space for the children to run about and play. Very inaccessible. You need to have a car to come here and yet it can get very crowded on weekends. Very funny food names on the menu too. Definitely will make you want to try the food

Friends brought us to this place. On the way there you get the feeling to be elsewhere than in Singapore. The restaurant is located at the shore and has a huge outside area as well. The owner is a german engineer who likes motorbikes. So most of the seats, tables and other furniture have a link to motorbike. The food is ok. What i liked was the location itself. Its such a contract to the hustle and bustle in downtown singapore. Its good for families with kids as they can play aroun
4
atmosphere: goodservice: acceptablewomen: dude! its a dining place, not a nightclub. ok. just kidding, nofood: subjective but some are worth tryingtried the burger and spicy wings. burger average, spicy wings. well, eh, erm... i gues they forgot what spicy meant but hell, it taste good... gotta try the onion bloom. looks good, taste good, lotsa fart afterthat... lol..
4
This beautiful resturant is well hidden away from the busy crowd. Enjoy the cool bikers theme and rustic surroundings. Food wise the chicken wings and the sudden death version are both fantastic. Although the sudden death version is really burning, need a couple of ice cooled beer to wash it down.Price is slightly on the high side, and it is not air conditioned, meaning the sweat after eating the Buffalo wing will continue to stay in your shirt

Approaching via Andrews Ave feels like a time warp- secondary jungle, few buildings, narrow road (Don't turn left). As you pass the kitchen, you'll see a pool table disguised as a '65 Mustang, then a Ducati super bike, and other boy toys. Handlebar is not a typical "biker bar," you might see in the West. The staff are cheerful, the kitchen is clean and fast, the food is honest (ribs, chili, wings, etc) and nicely finished, though certainly not cheap. Great view of the Straits is a bonus! HINT: If you want your guests to enjoy an "over the top" experience, order a pitcher of Margaritas, whipped up at your table by a gasoline-powered blender controlled by a twist grip on the (as you guessed) handlebars

This a quaint bar that feels like its in the middle of nowhere - and takes forever to get to! Lovely open spaces by the waterside, the bar itself is done up in a motorcycle them - I believe its also patronised by groups of bikers. Pet friendly and kid friendly, perfect for early evenings, with margaritas that are blended on a motorcycle engine on your table itself!The real highlight for me was their Sudden Death chicken wings - which are super spicy and can you get you sweating buckets in the first 3 bites - not advisable for those with a low tolerance to spicy stuff! They do have normal chicken wings as well - that also come in mild, medium and hot spice levels. Also had the their lotus onion - try it, you'll like it

Have been here a number of times with family and friends. Always been welcomed. If you like burgers, and huge portions of food this place is for you. Limited menu. And hasn't changed in A long time. Out of the way unless you have transport, and limited indoor dining if it rains, they do however have rain hoods that wheel out to cover the tables. Good fun with a group but not a romantic place for couples!!!!!
4
But, in Singapore! Overlooks straits of Johore, so be careful with your service provider. You may end up using celcom! Though I had no connection at all!Place is quaint and love their rain shades though it can be a bit dark. Food was slow, but good. We only hard burgers, and they were juicy. It's a long drive from the heart of town, but nice if you want something different and to get away from it all
5
Great location and fabulous themed bar. We used uber to get here as its a bit out of the way. We had appetizers and haven't tasted better wings (cocaine) and jalapeÃ±o poppers.. We went mild and still felt a burn. There was a mistake with my drink and before I could mention it, the head bar lady realized and brought it back to replace. Attention to detail was great. We will be back.

We had been to this place dozens of times over the last few years and it was absolutely one of our favorite places for food, atmosphere, staff, service, beer, tequila... everything. It was truly a taste of the West.Sadly- it has become Sg standard- poor service, no character and bad atmosphere. The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd have have been replaced with low volume garbage. At 7pm on this Friday night all tables are reserved and empty... The food is still good but the atmosphere is gone... so sad
4
Seldom you will find a nice place to dine alfresco and with a nice sea view. However, getting there can be a challenge if you don't drive. Otherwise, a nice place to check out. My kids, wife and myself simply love this place and their food is to die for. Great location, nice food and drinks and of course wonderful service staff especially their lady boss Jen. But do take note to make prior reservations if you plan to go on weekends as they are ALWAYS packed
4
Quite a distance from the main road. Its got nice seaview but when I was there last weekend, it was too hazy. Love their fish and chips and the onion blossom is too big for 2 to share. The staff and the lady boss are friendly and you need to wait for quite a while for your food due to the weekend crowd.Free parking, you can just park around the area or just outside the gate.Will go there again once the hazy days are over
5
The food that they cook is delicious their sauce added in the dishes is good but wish its salad have a better dressing
5
This meatlovers place is a bit far from Singapore city centre but the steaks and burgers are totally worth the ride!
1
bad service, bad location... food and drink offer are ok, but now these days "ok" is not enough, especially in this competition like in Singapore.
Sorry, but can skip that.
4
The focaccia bread pizza is great and you are allowed toppings like scrambled eggs ! the scenery can be beautiful if the sun helps during the evening time.
5
Great bar, nice bike theme, benches outside by the water (roll over covers for the rain), bikers encouraged to park the bike at the benches. Food superb, The suicide wings for the brave only.
Out of the way but well worth the trip.
5
Nice place to dine in if you are a big fans of motorbike and cars. Many display set in parts of car and motorbike use to serve us at dinner. Place quite remote. Need transport to go. Food is nice too. Beautiful view of the sea too

Close friends in Singapore brought me here for dinner. Loved the location overlooking the sea where you can see the lights from Johor. Its a huge space. The bar was biker themed however kids are not allowed in. I noticed though that most are attracted to the al fresco area. Open & breezy with a mix of wooden tables with benches or plastic chairs.Food wise I feel it is average. Portions are huge with decent pricing however quality wise could be better. The ribs I had were tough. Service is a hit and miss. At times tough to get their attention. I did enjoy the special margarita though. This is where they blend it in front of you with a motorbike engine type contraption.Might be hard to find this place. It is located deep within Sembawang. Worth a visit at least once I guess just to soak in the experience
3
If you like average experience on your off day you will be contented.I expected more. Staff is not attentive and feels like an arrogance towards locals...Drinks offer also only average, and worst the value since it's too pricy.Don't they get it, high price only works with top service...

Located on the Waterfront, with outdoor seating that can be covered at a moments notice, Handlebar is a must for the Motorcycle Enthusiast in Singapore, if only for the fact you can ride your bike up to the table.The menu offers tasty American-themed fare, with the Hamburgers and Chilli both getting rave reviews from my guests.As the other reviewer has stated, the Wings are not for the faint-hearted. I consider myself a Chilli-fiend and eat a chilli based dish at least 3 times a week, however the Suicide wings here tested me to the limit, and I am somewhat embarrassed to say (as the photo shows) that I only managed to finish 4 of the 6 on offer.Whilst it is a "Biker-bar" in the loosest sense, families and those who travel on four wheels are more than welcome
5
This place is the best. You usually get a nice breeze blowing off the water and the food is excellent. The staff is attentive without being bothersome and it is totally unlike anything else in Singapore.. the staff actually makes sure customers are taken care of
