The Chirashi Don is definitely value for money! U can't go wrong with this as this is a must order each time i visit Hachi Tei.

Simply the best maki I've had outside of Japan, super fresh sashimi at excellent value and delicious fish roe given to us to taste by the chef and owner. I will never waste my time and money at Sushi restaurant chains again. This place is epic. If you love Sushi and Sashimi you must come her

Excellent couple run establishment with decent Japanese food. There is not much fancy decor but we like the quaint quiet environment. Need to navigate if you are not familiar with the region, note that parking needs to be by coupon which is rare in current Singapore

They serve authentic japanese food with fresh sashimi at reasonable prices. The staff are very friendly. This place is so good, yet very underrated. I first visited this place a few years ago and they have been serving good food consistently. My first dish was tempura udon and felt very happy eating it, I almost burst out giggling. Why? I thought that only happened in the movies like "Ramen girl" whose reaction was an out-burst of laughter because the food was so good and one could feel the love that goes into the cooking. And this happened in reality at Hachi tei.Recommendations: Ebi tempura with soba, sashimi, croquette, tempura udon, sesame ice cream.Tips: Order their burnt maki, you can't find it in their menu. It was recommended by the lady boss. It is a unagi maki that is torched with a flame

Restaurant may not have too many food options but it was good for people like me who takes very long to decide what i want. Was impressed with the staff's service. Sashimi were really fresh! Somehow i felt really at home dining there. I will return to dine because the i really like the service there and the freshness of the food

I love this place. I always sit outside - practically in the street - and I am always great ed with a smile. The first few times I came here I thought the menu was a little boring. The sashimi and sushi was great but I didn't know what else to order. I did find the solution. I tell the chef how hungry I am and let him cook up something based on the raw materials of the day. I have never been disappointed

Often expats like myself find dining at Japanese restaurants intimidating given the sometimes language and menu 'barriers'. Not so at Hachi Tei. This is one of the friendliest restaurants in the Tanjong Pagar neighbourhood. Always a cheerful welcome, prompt menu and tea service and food advice/explanations freely given. I have now eaten here a few times, it almost feels like 'coming home' as the hostess/waitresses make me feel so welcome. For decent Japanese food that won't break the bank, you can't go wrong at this place
