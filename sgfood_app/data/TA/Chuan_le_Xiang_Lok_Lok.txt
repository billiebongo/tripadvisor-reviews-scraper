The food was super good. So many variety from seafood to land meat. The best for me is the pork parts. There is also the chilli that is a must try. The chilli is spicy but it really really taste very good.

An awesome place among the industrial area for spacious Satay Celup - Lok Lok. The closest you can find in Singapore if you are missing the one in Malacca.
Staff is always on the ball and friendly. Recommended!

If you been craving for malacca satay lok lok. You may go to this place to satisfy your cravings..Although the food is as tasty as Malacca one but still satisfying..Simple food at a higher price (1 stick at $1), for the taste of novelty. Good place to chill with friends.The place have dart machines for U n your friend to have a PK rounds after meal... Overall, not a bad place to chill but the place a little hard to find in night. So watch out for signs or follow ya GPS... =

Wow finally in Singapore..... I remembered that everytime i have craving for this Satay Lok Lok, i have to travel all the way to Malacca to have it. The whole journey took me for few hours drive, pass thru the custom just to satisfy my cravings. Now finally someone have the business sense to start it here in Singapore.. The price was reasonable and service was excellent. Oh yes car park lot was generous.They even have self made chicken broth or satay celup for all range of customers...Located at western part of Singapore allows me to avoid traffic jam during peak hours instead at town area with heavy traffic
