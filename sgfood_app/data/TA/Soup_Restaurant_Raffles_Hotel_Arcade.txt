Limited menu during CNY period. Both their signature dishes - Samsui chicken and ah gong vegetable not as good as before - too hard.
1
Service was slow, food was ex and worse, not of quality at all!! What a waste of $$ and time!! Pls do not go!
3
The food is average but the service could be improved by being more friendly.
The location is good but the atmosphere is a bit on the cold side.
Ideally for larger groups. Not a good intimate setting for couples or budding romances.

The food was good. But the service was rather poor. Unfitting of the location at raffles hotel. Eg. Service was slow. Waitresses didn't bother to change the plates in between dishes when the plates were obviously piled up with bones. Waitresses were slow and non-attentive to our simple request for another saucer of chopped green Chilli asking why we need more. This is after we ordered a pricy CNY set meal

When seeking a dinner recommendation from our hotel concierge, we heard the story of the Samsui women who came to Singapore from China to work in the early 1900s. They were primarily labourers and highly principled, generally rejecting jobs of a seedy nature even if it meant no income at all.Apparently these women became known for a specific steamed chicken dish which is now the key offering at the Soup chain of restaurants, albeit (I expect) with some embellishment.The Soup outlet we chose was in the Raffles retail arcade and with major renovations pending at Raffles, the decor was basic while still maintaining the character of the place.The food was excellent - the Samsui ginger chicken a standout.We opted for a bottle of wine which is always a bit risky in Singapore - over priced and under served (the latter as a result of inadequate staff training).Overall, a wonderful dining experience with a noisy group of locals sitting nearby enjoying themselves, and rightly drinking Tiger beer

The signature Samsui chicken dish was disappointing. The chicken was the toughest I've ever had in any Soup Restaurant in the rest of Singapore. The Ah Gong Sweet Potato leaves were chewy unlike the melt in the mouth ones elsewhere as well. We brought our out of town guests there & no one was over-awed by the signature dishes. Instead they liked the new shredded duck in lettuce dish which I found quite dry & tough too. Guess that even made a stronger positive impression than the usual dishes! We went at 11:30 when they just opened. Could it be that the food was prepared from the day before & reheated, hence the unusual degree of toughness?

I was a regualr at other soup restaurant. And we have decided to try this new one at Raffles Hotel. Very happy with their service. The staff was friendly polite and attentive. And maybe its just me, i find that the food there is nicer than other soup restaurants. Perhaps because there are not many people there and the chef can prepare the food more diligently. But we enjoyed ourselves. Ambience was very nice.

Inspired by Samsui lady and chinatown of Singapore, our experience in the Soup Restaurant was very authentic. It is located in Raffles hotel on the street side (opposite to Raffles City Center). The decor is based on traditional Singaporean style with private corners and glass tables displaying antique cutlery and jewelry boxes. We came here for lunch and were really impressed with the courteous service of the restaurant manager, who was friendly, and also took her time to explain to us each and every dish. Even when we planned to have a light lunch, the dishes were very tempting. We tried some seafood noodles, black chicken soup in fresh coconut, tofu stew and steamed fish. Everything was so delicious that in the end we came back again another day. That time we finally tried chili crab with traditional buns and whole fish cooked in two ways (one side of the fish was steamed and another fried). Delish!!! Definitely a place to come back, but this time with a super empty stomach!

Went to Soup Restaurant as I was looking to boost my energy with nutritional double boiled soup. Soup options were plentiful. I went for the double boiled pork soup together with the Samsui Chicken and Ah Kun Sweet Potato Leaves. Will be back.
5
After being tired of the tour and shopping, we ate a super food at this restaurant. The soup is super delicious. The service is also great.
3
Just another average Chinese restaurant but with wide range of soups to choose. They have set lunch, set dinner and a-la-carte as well. To me all soups taste yummy and taste like home cooked.
4
Excellent food and fast service.
Great variation on the rich menu. Chicken witj ginger was delicious as the venison cooked to perfection .
But tje place is far to cool. Aircon should be adjusted for customers and not for the servants.

Friends treated our family to the United Square location. We had the set meal for 5 with double-boiled Black chicken soup, Steamed Catfish, Broccoli, Tofu and Shrimp, Spare Ribs (sweet and sour?), Fried Rice and Samsui Chicken.There were 5 adults and 4 children. We were satisfied in both quantity and quality. Was at the Changi Airport two days later and had lunch at T2 location. Just as good

Apparently there is a chain known as Soup Restaurant, but when I walked past Raffles Hotel a few days ago, I saw Soup Restaurant for the first time, boldly facing 2 streets. Apparently it has been open at this specific location for approx. 4 weeks.We were to be flying home a few hours later, so the idea of soup as a pre-flight meal sounded good. But, as it turns out, we tried a few things, but not soup.The yam puffs, the char siew bao and something that I had never seen before, samsui ginger bau, were all good, served just right, not sticking to the wooden baskets. We then shared a black pepper salmon, which was very good also, apart from the fact that it was nearly hidden or drowned by sliced onions.Overall, very good food.Service - the staff were not formal, yet somehow they were not as helpful as you would expect in a place that was decked out formally with fine interior design in a fine old building.I am sure that the group Soup Restaurant has the right formula and this new location should be a winner for them

An ever reliable of Cantonese home fare, we tucked into a sublime mah yeow fish belly stir fried with onions and oyster sauce. Superb! The salted yolk squid was perfect with a lovely batter dressed in yolk. The sambal kangkong was fiery with the right amount of belachan.

This month, visited there twice at IMM branch (continuously 2 Satuardays).Samsui chicken is a must have dish. It's debone steamed chicken served with lettuce and ginger. If you are not comfortable to eat cold chicken, then you better try their other dishes..Tofu and prawns is good especially ate with steamed rice, use the sauce to mix with your rice.The daily boiled soup is good if you are a soup person. Personally, I often get the pork rib and lotus root soup, but it's salty for my taste bud.For vegetable, go for tapiocal leaves with sambal chillie

I think there should be another category in your overall rating as I would rate the restaurant and my lunch experience as above average.( GOOD would be more accurate) 4 friends and us saw a queque at Soup restaurant on 17th December 2014 and we decided to try the lunch buffet. The food was good and service staff were alright and $16.90 was reasonable as they offered a wide variety of dishes. My only suggestion for improvement would be complimentary chinese tea as tea and even desserts are offered at many other similar standard restaurants as part of price of buffet.We are introducing 2 other friends to Soup @ Hougang Mall for lunch on 30th December and all are looking fwd to enjoying a good meal there. We hope that my suggestion of complimentary chinese tea would considered favourably by the management. Of course we are happy to pay for all other kinds of more expensive tea or beverages.Thank you Soup@ Hougang for giving us a good lunch experience.Mrs G koh

Very soft succulent white deboned chicken served in gingered sesame sauce instead of chilli is the speciality of this restaurant. The master chef of this dish is our infamous Samsui women who laid the bricks of our buildings in Singapore early history.To energise your tired soul you can order the ginseng soup with pork that has been brewed for hours.We ordered sweet potato leaves sautÃ©ed with pounded dried prawns with chilli and this added to our appetite further.The fish belly deep fried in black sauce with green onions and chilli is delicious.One of the waiter industriously sourced " chili padi", small spicy chilli for my family member as it enhance the food further.... Very pleasing attentive service .... Good job! A good family restaurant.

Friends took us out for this culinary delight.... the food just kept coming. The hospitality was amazing. The costs (I have no idea since we were hosted). It was not a large space with some rooms off the main dining area. Great seafood!
5
We went there a few times and really enjoyed there dishes. Service was very quick and friendly staff. Highly recommended.

liked the soup (corn) the samsui Ginger chicken and all the other dishes (including great vegetables). These restaurants are all over Singapore and they do a great job.

Was here with my family for dinner. Order their Samsui chicken, chicken meat not smooth, slightly overcooked. The ginger sauce that comes with the chicken too sweet, overcome the ginger taste. The salt fish patties, very badly done, too much flour & the meat process by machine, don't hve the bite. Their lotus soup very salty

Full reviews and photos: http://eatplaycook22.blogspot.sg/2014/08/eat-famous-samsui-ginger-chicken-soup.htmlHad a great chit chat session and lunch at Soup Restaurant. This is not my first time having meal at Soup Restaurant, and so far their quality of food has been consistent. Some of the must try: Samsui Ginger Chicken (do note that this dish is cold), stir fry sweet potato leaves, and their double boiled soup.During my recent visit in Mid July, there is an ongoing OCBC credit card promotion, with every order of Samsui Chicken (any size), you can get one complimentary dish from 3 choices... cant remember what are the choices, but one of them is claypot salmon and it was good!The staff that serves us also were very friendly, make our meal very enjoyable :

For non- singaporean;s info, Sansui women came by the thousands from Shanshui in Guangzhou to serve as earlier pioneers (labourers) in the construction sector in Singapore. The food they serve here is by no means high end cuisine but perhaps represents what sansui women ate. The chicken and soup as you can read from many reviews below.'We ordered their house special steamed minced pork which tasted flat to me. Other dishes ordered including sweet potato leaves, tofu, broccoli with bean curd - which were average(to me) and did not lasting impression.The perhaps redeeming feature is the soup and the chicken. We however did not have the chicken and hence cannot comment, but If I was after chicken l'd rather go to many chicken rice stalls all around Singapore. Would be interested to hear from more locals what they think of this place

Regret to choose lou hei at Soup Restaurant at United Square. We were the first customer in the queue on the first day the restaurant opened after the Lunar Chinese New Year. We were seated at the corner and have to change seats because the waiter was not professional while serving us tea. He spilled the tea and we have to switch to the next table. We waited very long for our lou hei and were mad as why were we not being served while other tables were already having their lou hei. After a long & patience wait then we got our lou hei, followed by the first dish. Again we have to wait for the next dishes till our rice has turned cold. We have informed four waiters on our order, but none is able to help. With no choice, we decided to cancel the rest of the order since they were not cooked yet, and leave the restaurant. Service here is very poor and will not go back to this restaurant

Always appreciated the simple, hearty & delicious food served at the chain.Joined a long queue outside the newly refurbished Suntec City branch. Business was good here.Spacious seating with an authentic Chinese restaurant ambience. Ample walking spaces amongst the tables. Not cramped & crowded. Ordered alacarte. Appetizer was a plate of fragrant steamed/ boiled peanuts.A large range of herbal soups with various tonics that have health benefits labelled as 'calming, nourishing, detoxifying, etc'. Soups are always delicious. Sambal kangkong was cooked really well, oily but spicy.Prawns cooked with tofu in tomato sauce went really well with white rice.SautÃ©ed fish slices with spring onions was good.Our only grouses was that the rice came too early with the soup and the ginger chicken came too late. This signature dish enjoyed by the poor & frugal Samsui women only on their lunar new year celebrations, should have come immediately after the soup. The set menu also has changed with fewer dishes & a higher price. But we will certainly come back again & again

This restaurant can be found at the airport and most of the shopping mall. I recently dine in at Soup Restaurant Clementi Mall.The ambience is good. Similar with the 1 that I had in Vivo city. Great chicken with ginger. Must try if u come to Singapore. Their other food was tasty too.If u order set. 2 persons portion can be share with 2-4 persons. Just request for extra soup and rice.Definitely recommended. I have been to this restaurant many times

The Ginger chicken was great, also had the sweet and sour with fried lettuce. Il def go back again ......................

Great value for good food. Good service. Order the chicken and shamelessly ask for extra ginger sauce.
5
Good food. Good soups. Good service. Must have sansui chicken with ginger sauce. Try prawns with garlic sauce & fried meesua. Have hot chrysanthemum tea to go along. Satisfying!

I love all the food ordered. But my favorite one is the vegetable dish with various eggs, the pitan (century egg) was sooo yummyy.

Collected the Reunion Take-away set ($338) on 8 Feb 13. Chicken and prawn meat in the 3 treasures were over-cooked and hard . Fried rice very very plain. Totally disappointed with the Abalone Healthy Pen Cai. Pre-pack!! Taste horrible and felt cheated. Spolied my reunion dinner. NEVER NEVER buy this again!!

The Soup Kitchen has the best chicken I have eaten. The chicken was juicy, and the sauce was excellent. We had other dishes such as the tofu, but they are of the normal standard. We were seated very quickly, and the service is good. I would highly recommend you to try the chicken. It is worth the trip
5
Excellent food and soup! i was ordering the set food because i was going with my family by the time, food by food taste amazing! my favourite was the "sweet and sour pork with cherry tomato" the taste was going to make you speechless! :Pmy recommendation: the famous ginger chicken  sweet and sour pork any soup ( all has its own specialty )Final Word : This restaurant was GREAT yet don't expect it would be cheap though :
5
This is a unique chain of restaurants in that each is unique. Yes it offers soups that are good and each has a healing aspect. They say hot soup is good on a hot day. For me Soup Restaurant is a stop for the national dish of Singapore : Chicken Rice. Yum this is room tempertaure chicken perfectly flavored with herbs, served with rice and a succlent ginger garlic oill sauce. Grab this and a beer .. Looks like nothing but tastes so good. You can also oreder this reat from Book The Cook on Singapore Airlines shpould yoyu get addicted

The chicken with ginger sauce is the best around; there are other notable dishes to try too, including fried potato leaves (with or without chill known respectively as grandpa's and grandma's). Service is always good and reservations are recommended, especially if you are around the popular branches like Scotts Road and the airport
