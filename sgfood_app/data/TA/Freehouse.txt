The range of beers here is decent, but I feel like quite common craft beers around town. The prices were quite expensive, and the food (calamari) wasn't very good. Too sweet actually to finish.

Go for the drinks only and atmosphere. Really more of a watering hole than anything else. Rotating selection of craft beers. The food is somewhere between poor to pedestrian

Just happened to find Freehouse on way back from visiting Chinatown in search of a cold beer. Good beer choices, friendly servers who gave great descriptions of the beer choices. Hope to visit again before we head back to the states.

One of my favourite craft beer bars in Singapore. Great selection. Friendly informative service. And a great setting.

Spent a couple of hours sampling beers from around the world. Choice of 30+ beers. Snack food was also ok. Enter via a doorway and go upstairs to the bar.

Ssamjang fries are the absolute bomb. Bombay fried chicken burger was no let down either. There's a beer for every taste too.

Cosy bar with 16 craft beers on tap although the night I visited, the selection was quite limited.Bar staff and customers were friendly and on Saturday night there was $3 off all beers. Not far from Boat Quay and the Lau Pa Sat hawker center is just around the corner. Didn’t try the food

This is a great little pub with amazing craft beers from all over the world. The place is run by a colourful North America (I think he’s a Canadian, but I didn’t want to get it wrong and insult him by getting his roots wrong). The range of beers is extensive and he loves to let you try as many as you want so you can find your beer. The place is small, has great music and very near Lau Pat Sat, if you want to get some satay after getting drunk! They do serve food, but I didn’t get a chance to try. If you’re in the area then Freehouse is a great little place to chill out and have a drink or two or three..

Freehouse it's a ice place to grab a beer, and chat with friends. I was here with my boyfriend and decided to have a calamari tapas. Actually it wasn't the best idea as they came in a sweet sauce that was not good at all. We haven't finished the portion, just the beers (quite good selections). So... Good for beers not at all for food.

I personally love sweet alcohol and the apple crumble cider was superb! I also tried the imperial stout and it was smooth and rich. My group of us ordered an assortment of food and all of them were good as well. The Korean fries and crispy squid were my favorite. The pulled pork pita was a little dry but the burger was great.
