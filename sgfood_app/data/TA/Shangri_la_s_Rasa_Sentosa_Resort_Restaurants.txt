The spread in the morning has much more variety than the lunch but for the taste, I would rate just average. However they have provided a food corner for the kidsand I also saw a baby corner but I'm not sure what was there.
5
Just life the overall hotel experience, the experience at the restaurant was too 5 star. Be it service mindedness or taste, everything was great.
5
The very best of A la Carte hospitality, to be expected from a SL hotel. The wines although slightly expensive (personal opinion) were quite sublime.
3
Small rooms, canteen restaurants, difficult to get an umbrella by the pool unless you get the right staff to clear some of the towel on loungers before breakfast mob.
Decent bar with good cocktails and generally good staff.
5
Had great time at Rasa Sentosa Resort. Breakfast options are very good. Indian Breakfast was consistently good. Kids have special selctions to choose from
5
Wide spread international buffet that comes with kids corner! We visited the restaurant several times as part of our Family Fun Package and was impressed by the spread of the dishes and the cuisine type. Very delicious - great food, nice ambience! We will be back! :

Such a busy hotel! Pool great for all. Great kids activities put on in the pool each day. Pool towels plentiful, no restriction on how many you are permitted to take. Guest rooms are clean and comfortable. Bathrooms are very nice and fully stocked with good toiletries. Free bottled water left in our room every day. Breakfast......l recommend you arrive around 7:30/8am. Otherwise you will more than likely be queuing for up to 20/30mins. Lots of global cuisines so you will not be disappointed. A few staff need further training on the resorts map! We asked one staff member were the Barnacles restaurant was and he had to ask someone else as he was not sure?! Altogether, a good hotel. It did the job it needed to do for our short break. Enjoy
5
Staff is warm hearted and breakfast is great. We were surrounded by peacocks while eating breakfast. One of them was showing off his beautiful tail on my departure date. A very warm farewell. It was my birthday the date I checked out and the hotel surprised me with a birthday cake the night before which is very nice. I got a box of chocolates when I checked out as my birthday gift. Will definitely come back if I visit Santosa again
2
This hotel has nothing going for it and would recommend choosing somewhere elseLocation - poor for Santosa and not near the monorail service. You need a 10min bus from the hotel to get to universal or the monorail Staff - manipulative and try and sell you a room Upgrade through dodgey sales techniques for example the people checking in next to us with the same room where advised there room was ready, our check in lady said we need to pay $80 for an upgrade (mind you we didnâ€™t even want to check in early as we had things to do)When declined the upsell the staff member got quite rude Rooms - small and tired Breakfast - this is why the place gets extra star , has good choic

Our family had brunch during the Sunday Garden Party, which was great for kids! Buffet spread was very good in terms of variety and quality. Worth mentioning was the seafood, Indian cuisine and grill. Kids were delighted with a magic show at the garden next to the restaurant and beach. (There is also the option of using the pool facilities at Rasa Sentosa by paying for the use.
5
Great buffet breakfast to suit all palettes and cultures - wide variety and more than reasonable quality.
Exceptional value for money for main meals too, providing a more than adequate option for dining in.
4
Friendly waitreses, several types of cuisinis resturants, asian, indian, arab, moroccan and western. Al cart or buffet.
5
Beautiful rooms, hotel, service pool service, layout of the hotel, breakfast from around the world in several sittings yum!
5
Sat outside on verandah with great views. Device was fast and friendly waitress. Very big menu choice or buffet style offered. Good was tasty and well presented would recommend.
5
Me and my family had our buffet dinner at this restaurant. The buffet spread was very good! We all had a great meal here.
5
Shangri-La's collection of resort restaurants certainly cater for all tastes and food types of all nationalities. Service is allways with a smile ..... only to be recommended.
5
The food was really delicious at this hotel. We loved the variety of options. Generally, I don't like to go to buffet type restaurants but in a hotel of this quality is well worth to try. Singapore is so rich in culinary culture and every morning and night we got delighted trying different dishes. We ate at the hotel for breakfast and dinner for 2 nights and there was not enough time or room in my tummy to try all the delicious plates. Also, the cooks and servers were so friendly and eager to help. It's been 3 weeks since we visited and I am still thinking about it fondly
4
I am stayed in shangri-la sentosa hotel for 4 days, it's good hotel because there have many place in same location and not far away from the hotel. Every days take breakfast here with so many variation menu, and absolutely is delicious. Also one night i have dinner in restaurant, and i am really satisfied with the taste of the menu. In the morning you can go to beach ( private beach in hotel ), so clean , not crowded and really enjoyed to stay here. I recommend it
5
We've just had a new baby and wanted somewhere relatively good quality, guaranteed to be clean and peaceful, so I thought "Shangri-La Sentose, next to the sea, with beach, perfect location". We had also had a "work's do" there before Chirstmas and the service had been excellent. We went to the Sea Shell outlet on the 3rd floor. You can eat indoors or outdoors and t's a perfect place for a romantic meal (Great views), a family meal or, like us, somewhere where you could find a nice quiet corner so that baby would not disturb anyone. We had the buffet. The food was as you would expect = lots of it, prawns, crab and 4 different stations - Indian, Noodles, Chinese AND a special section for kids - sausage rolls, noodles, fish fingers. Don't get this wrong - it is not a restaurant just for families with children, but it is simply child friendly. They even have a child's section (tucked away) where you can help yourself to baby food, drink, sterilisers, food warmers, nappies/diapers etc. Perfect for anyone with your kids. But as I said, with the setting and views this can also be a very romantic outlet. There was no WOW factor, but everything simply worked and worked well. Would we go again? Definitely - in fact we have already been back two times and are going again this weekend. Why? Everything simply works, everything is good, service is good and the setting/location makes you think you are on holiday and not in Singapore.
5
The food at the Sunday lunch buffet, although quite expensive, was outstanding. Everything I tried was magnificent. Great Indian curries (cooked and served by the truly delightful Chef, George John), Japanese food, seafood, salads, cheeses, desserts, grill. Although we weren't guests of the resort, we were permitted to use the pool that day too. We had an absolutely wonderful day lying on couches by the sea (watching a 1.5m long monitor lizard pop it's head over the edge was a bit of a thrill), swimming in the pool and meeting some lovely people. Will definitely stay here on my next visit to Singapore
4
A birthday treat for lunch buffet. the spread wasn't a lot but good to kept your stomach at bay. After the spread, you are given 'ticket' for a swim.
4
Stopped here when traveling back from Siloso Point to the beach. Very impressed with the quality of the food and the service.
4
The most extensive buffet we have ever experiences - a very wide variety of food available including shell fish and outside BBQ and pasta bar as well as various Asian dishes. Small portions available for children at the children station too. Great variety of fruit available. Very enjoyabl
5
Best family resort in singapore. It's our second stay at Shangri-la Sentosa our first was just as a couple and we fell in love with the resort we had to bring our to young kids. We got a room with a king bed and a double sofa bed which is plenty of space for a family of four
4
just the largest selection of food you have ever seen. There are lots of children generally floating about due to the local attractions and the staff in the restaurant tend to treat the adults the same way as the kids with the hand puppets but it is kinda fu
4
Singapore is warm! So having a spot where you can chill with a cold drink and some cold water is great. We tried the pizza bar on the beach at first but no one wanted to serve us so we then went across to the Bar/Restaurant at Shangri La and were well looked after. Drinks, water and nuts thrown in as well in a quiet relaxing place away from the kids. Very enjoyable
5
Had a fantastic few days here with the kids. There is so much to do locally that we didn't spend too much time in the resort, The kids club is brilliant, the little ones (4 and 5 year olds) loved it. We travelled with our 5 children, the rooms are not as big as they seem in advertising but we did manage (not the most romantic trip for us adults). Overall they cater beautifully to families, the pool is great and the lifeguards on duty are very friendly. Breakfast is the biggest buffet I have EVER seen. Overall great value, and good fun :
5
There were many options for dining in the hotel resort if you do not feel like going out of the hotel and the restaurants offered excellent service with great food. If you do not even want to go out of your room and prefer in-room dining, there is also a wide variety of foods to choose from, of different cultures so that you can try out new things. There is entertainment for all ages, and the hotel is located beside a private beach, where you can enjoy the sun and a clean beach. However, the hotel is unsuitable if you are on a tight budget as it is rather pricy, but I highly recommend the hotel if you have sufficient cash and want to dash it on a great holiday
1
We sat at an indoor window seat on the 3rd Floor restaurant for over 15 minutes, mid afternoon, not too crowded. After awhile I got up and approached a waitress at the buffet, asking if someone could take our order. Still no one came to our table. The water guy filled our water glass a few times, but finally we gave up and left. We returned to our hotel / Shangri La near Orchard Road, where we got great service at the poolside dining.
5
The food and the service were amazing. The price too unfortunately. Fortunately one does not pay for young children. We had Sunday brunch at the Casserole outside facing the sea. Someone gave the children balloons and a magician played magic tricks. Eating there gives you access to the large pool which is well-equipped for children of all ages
5
Rainforest behind, white sand palm lined beaches in front, surrounded by entertainment for all ages.
Dine3 offered great service , an international menu and fantastic service.
5
the hotel was excellent the food and service was second to none the staff were efficient and nothing was to much trouble to attend to you a special thank you to sarah from the restaurant she was exceptional
5
wonderful stay as well as great food wonderful staff you have a lot of things to do especially for the kids , as the kids club ,canoeing , flying fox up and down the beach
5
Hotel was clean, service was very friendly and location was good. Food was excellent! I really recommend to stay there if you have chance.
5
It's very well managed resort and everything a family with young children need. Good for staying on the resort or going to the town. Taxi ride is about 10 min.
5
I went to there many times at night , it's serve best seafood ,and lots of delicious dish, the most I like is oysters and prawn !
5
The front desk rebooked my wife and I upon arrival on the top floor. The floor was quite, and the view was spectacular. Staff was incredible and very accommodating to our needs. The couples spa was amazing and well worth the experience. Our visit to Singapore was a last minute decision hence we had no time to play our itinerary. The front desk staff assisted us once we arrived making our trip to Singapore even more special. We spent 5 days there and that was simply not enough. I would definitely stay here again but at least two weeks the next time around.
1
Having stayed in this hotel I cant reconcile the endless AMASSING!! incredible!!! Glowing reviews that read like professional travel brochures..(funny about that) Sorry Rasa but the Restaurants are not amassing , the pool is 3 star , the service is average and the hotel is dated. Have a good read through and look for the genuine reviews before you blow your hard earned cash fellow travellers.
5
If you are looking for a relaxing place where you can enjoy your buffet meal without getting smacked by the crowd, while at the same time giving your kids a good time to enjoy their meal, this is the place! The restaurant has kids and baby buffet table where kidsmeals, sugar free juices and milk warmer are available. For adults, there are variety of dishes....Indian curries with prata, veal and sirloin steak, roasted turkey, sushi, cold cuts with cheeses, Asian cuisines and yummy desserts! It is locate nearby Underwater World and Siloso beach, so if you're done with your meal, you can head down to the beach and d spend the rest of the afternoon enjoying the beach
5
The buffet selection is enormous, taste for everyone, their buffet is plentiful in size and food variation, plus it is easy to walk around and help yourself even if the room is full. We were a group of 5 and all of us highly praised the food selection and taste, well done Chef 
4
Our very fussy 3 grandsons actually ate breakfast each morning and went back for seconds. Wonderful to see - excellent and plentiful selection -
5
The breakfast at this resort is the BEST in the World. I'll challenge anybody to tell me otherwise. The staff are super friendly and efficient.
5
Exceptional hotel for us, relaxing sublimely but so easy to get to town. We often stay here and will do so again.

Checked in here for the 3rd time...1st visit it was packed out and despite being a hotel guest we faced queues of 30mins to eat....went out of the hotel to meet clients elsewhere. 2nd visit was quieter and had a good time, great breakfast and dinner buffets.This time we checked in and after previous visits my girlfriend asked if they had any smoking rooms now...yes! We were told at checking in....after asking me the same questions like a baby in broken english i had the feeling this ROBOT didnt understand what she had asked...was just preprogrammed to inform us about the hotel....despite being told we had stayed there before.Room fine as usual but this time we were surrounded by others on both sides who could see us sitting on the balcony...zero privacy. Of course no smokingWe booked dinner buffet as before it could get quite busy....less than 20 people there. Deserted, we then looked over the food and struggled what to choose...yes it was THAT BAD. The selection was about 20% of what had gone before in terms of quality and offering. I looked at the meat and curry and found lentil curry and some other vegtarian nonsense no thanks!....the meat was dry. Pasta the chef was asked if he could make garlic pasta for my girlfriend and put his hands inside it after we saw him touching other items outside of his station.....Seafood for my girlfriend...she was disappointed most of what was offered before had gone.Total waste of money.....staff friendly though!Anyway breakfast is fine....Asked housekeeping for 3 razors (hotel razors arent strong) so i could shave my beard off....refused. only given two and told to call someone else if i needed more.NOW FOR THE SHOCK !!!!! Due to the time it takes for the "doormen" to order cabs and keep you waiting and uninformed we ordered from grabcar.I wheeled out the suitcase (no offer to help) and then opened the boot while my girlfriend got inside the car. Suddenly this abomination of a creature opens the car door and yells inside at my girlfriend "did you book this????" She replied "What, who are you" in total shock at being screamed at at in her face by this horrible man.I stopped and turned and by this time this "person" had his hand on my shoulder (yes physically touching me) and yelled something about booking this car (which was not a taxi but a grabcar which looks like a private car).I asked him for his name and why he was touching me....i also said his job was to help with our bags not shout in our faces or accost us....He pointed at his name tag and walked off...NO ONE ELSE came to assist with luggage at all...Noticed the Filipino staff were phenomenal....the chinese staff were robotic and English was not welcome to them.Wont be returning due to the actions of the supposed doorman or whatever people they employ at the front of their hotel..

Arriving late 2am we were welcomed by a delightful Staff Member.Had a great breakfast. Most of the food was hot.The amenities wonderful.Very clean no unpleasant odors.Close to free transport.Shuttle bus was great to Vivo City.My only complaint the pool could of been open until 10pm
5
I recently had 5 wonderful nights with my family at the Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa. What a terrific family hotel. My 6 year old twins loved it. They have fantastic children's water slides and shallow pools all under the shade. The kids club, called The Tree House were so nice. From the moment my children woke they asked could they visit the Tree House. The breakfast is probably the best I have ever had in any hotel. A big choice of Western, Indian and Chinese dishes. The evening buffet is similar but with a huge selection of seafood. The bedroom was big and clean. The hotel staff were all so friendly. 100% for sure we will be bac

went there for the second time this year for the sunday brunch. the choice of food and quality is great. also, the tables outside offer a breeze from the sea and add to the relaxing ambience.the service has consistently been the big disappointment. it starts with the booking. on the one hand, you are required to leave your credit card details to put your name down for a reservation. they will charge you 50% for a no-show. however, when you complain about this then they say 'we can hold the table for you for 15 min' (as is standard reservation policy in singapore). when we arrived, our name was not on the list. and just like during our first visit it turned out a big struggle to have them set up a table for us despite they were not fully booked. frowns and bad attitude from the waitresses just would not stop. A place like this deserves a better crew

Located on Sentosa island it is a short hotel shuttle ride to all the theme parks and vivo city on the main island. Stayed with my wife and 2 children aged 4 and 6.For the positives:- paid and upgraded to the larger executive room with 2 queen and sofa bed so it was a decent size room with separate bath and shower.- the pools were the best and is fantastic for families. There's a separate kids pool with 3 water slides and the main pool was huge and a compared for younger children too. No need to go to the beach nearby.- there a kids play room which is great too but limits the time you can spend there to a hour which is a shame- close to all the theme attractions and vivo city via frequent hotel shuttle- hotel staff very good and responsive- best breakfast buffet I've had for a long time. Massive variety, comfortable for families.Now for some the negatives:- one of the most expensive per nights 5 star hotels in Singapore so naturally expectations are high. So let's begin:- room was dirty, sticky floors and run down.- bed sheets were dirty had to be changed not once but twice- no where decent to eat at night, need to goto Vivo city- location is good but tucked away so to go anywhere you have to go on a shuttle.Whilst there were plenty of positives, the rooms were a massive disappointment. The hotel really needs a refurbish the rooms. I stayed in an upgraded room too so I can only imagine the condition of more basic rooms. I have stayed in other shangri-la's in other countries and this was not good.I would not recommend this hotel for the price it charges and the quality for the accommodation
5
This is a great venue for a casual Sunday brunch with the family. The selection of food is great for both adults and children, and once you let your belt out a notch is great to chill out by the pool while the kids have a swim
5
We had the opportunity to dine at the cafÃ© at the Shangri-La Sentosa during seafood night. What a great deal this is! A great selection of seafood, including lobster, oysters, shrimp, smoked salmon - you name it you can find it on the buffet. The service was attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening and our meal
5
We had the buffet breakfast in our resort package and wow so much selection and was so yummy, great for families as well with a kids selection of food area.
5
The breakfast Buffett was to die for everything super fresh and taste yummy. Almost made the $600 dollar a night room worth it.
5
The vast amount of choices and the food tastes really good. I have ate there for breakfast, lunch and dinner any really all is to be recommended. Whatever your choice is, the have it and yes there is even a baby corner.
4
Food was great! The location was awesome :)
Very spacious and great ambience
Definitely i would highly recommend it to everyone
A bit non-pocket friendly
5
Everything is wonderful. Having a holoday with a group of 4 friends. Just near the beach. Reccommend to everybody. Super!
3
The Rasa Sentosa has an amazing location and is a great place to stay in Singapore. However, a down-side, for us, were the mediocre and expensive dining options. Essentially a traditional but uninspired restaurant, an "all you can eat" family-orientated buffet and a very expensive noodle bar, resembling a cheap downtown cafe in all but price. The former waterside seafood restaurant has been closed (used to be great), much to our disappointment. It's a bit of an effort to go downtown to eat, but please do! Enjoy the hotel for its views, lovely staff and service but give dining there a miss
5
The buffet restaurant is very big and has a outside area to it, the food is good plenty of selection of hot, and cold also a good salad bar and fruit, cater for all types of food. The only thing I can complain about is people don't put the lids back down when getting their food, this makes the food cold, which is not good we like our food very hot, the chiefs need to tell customers about it, its good value for the money, we did get buffet breakfast included with our stay
4
wonderful attentive staff. Lovely amenities. very clean room. We were palced on top floor (11) and had a great view of resort. Only downfall was price for meals and drinks. $6.50 + gst + service charge for a 330mL can of coke or $17++ for a pint of Tiger beer is basically robbery
5
This place is expensive but you get what you pay for. There is a wide variety of food and desserts and a different theme every night. The quality is great and the atmosphere is perfect for families. The staff is top notch and ready to get you whatever you want. This is not a place for a romantic dinner but it's great if you want to sit down and eat at the best buffet in Sentosa island. The only down fall is the price
4
The Shangrila Rasa is one of my best ever experience when it comes to hotel both in terms of service as well as the stay experience. The hotel rooms had all things needed to make the stay comfortable and the buffet spread both Morning and Evening was huge and deliciou
4
We spent most of our time eating at the Noodle bar over the buffet.
Buffet was a expensive depending on how much you eat.
5
Everyone, from the waiters to the chefs, smiles and asks if you would like something different. Very accommodating to special requests.
3
Waited 5 minutes for a seat and walked the restauarant to get a bill. Food just OK and high priced. Many of the specialties of Singapore are not here and the rich palate of the Chinese, Indian and Malay influences are very limited
5
Buffet style food but with an amazing selection to suit anyones taste. There is also a beach front cafe style bar called Piazza which offers cheaper dishes such as pizza and pasta and salads. Just a few minutes walk along the beach from the hotel.
5
Can't praise the food highly enough and very friendly staff! They have a different themed dinner each night and we had local food buffet which was delicious! Tried several dishes I wouldn't normally eat !
4
Dinned there for NYE function. Amazing range of food in a 70m long buffet. Service and knowledge of drinks was a little erratic
4
The set menu is good for you to choose especially for one or two persons. What we had was just dinner and not sure about lunch service.
3
On the first midnight of the day we checked in, the performance noises from the beach made us difficult to get asleep. The day when we checked out, there were only two concierge people there and we guests were asked to line up to wait for the taxi instead of sit in more comfortable sofa zones just to make their work convenient? It is also confusing why there were only so few staff there. Imagine one guest taxi in and another departure, then whose bags should be dealt with first? Feel very disappointed with the poor service at Shangri-la.
5
The food in all the restaurants at shangri-la were fantastic some of the best food i have eaten in such a long time. My only dislike is the ++ on everything when you see the price of what you are ordering then get the bill at the end the plus plus makes for an expensive dinner
5
AMAZING CUISINE .Indian , continental and Chinese buffet hence the DINE ON 3 concept !!!the salads were awesome, the Laksa simply mouth-watering and asking for seconds .Since it was buffet there was ample time to enjoy the sights and sounds and the wandering peacocks and peahens !!!!Truly relaxing atmosphere with a delectable dessert counter . RECOMMEND FOR A LAZY RELAXED FAMILY GET TOGETHER OR A COSY TWO SOME .!!!
4
Very good quality of food, limited menu but all the dishes were excellent. Can dine either indoors or outdoors and the service was very good.
5
The friendliness of the staff and choice of cuisine. The wild life, a monkey sitting on our balcony and monitor lizard and peacocks roaming the grounds.
2
Average food, no choice ; no real eggs used for omelets at breakfast but egg solution with chemicals ....
5
You will be spoilt for choice... the staff is quick to help and polite there were peacocks while we were having the food it was a nice experience
4
the buffet food spread was huge. especially mentionable is the the kids menu n buffet area altered to suit to their height, also had colourful spread n crockery to attract kids
5
Tried all options here - Trapizza pizza on the beach; 8 Noodles; Casserole and Silver Shell café; he magnificent buffet room & The Bubble Bar; snacks and drinks at poolside from the Siloso Beach Bar. All were fabulous and at good pricing.
5
Tasty Food options - great service. Plenty of choice for whole family. Nice views. Staff very helpful
3
Yesterday we had gone to this Dine on 3 resturant for dinner with a few guests. The resort is star rated and therefore we had high expectations from this restaurant as well. But we were thoroughly disappointed to say the least. Firstly the ambience was not too great. The restaurant was poorly lit. We ordered our food and drinks from the menu which was very limited, yet was quite pricey. The drinks came promptly but we were made to wait at least 40 mins for our order. Anyway after a few more requests to the hotel staff the food came. The serving sizes were pretty small , in the serving bowls which were quite big. We were totally disappointed. Food taste was average.The restaurant might be taking the customers for granted as this is a resort and the guests have limited option to eat outside
4
Dinner included a terrific spread of food and drink. We enjoyed cocktails at the poolside bar beforehand. I would not hesitate to recommend the restaurant as being better than average. Our only problem was getting taxis to leave afterwards. Two of our party were staying at the hotel, which they think is terrific
4
This hotel really caters to children. Ice cream upon arrival, slushies at the pool! They even had their staff in the pool playing with surf boards and the kids. My kids had a great time. We are dinner at casserole and it was one of the better dinners we've had here
4
We ate in the restaurant here when we visited sentosa, it was very nice, although quite overpriced I thought. The beef burger was very good though, I would definitely recommend it.
4
Lovely hotel and views for a wedding. Well set up reception, cocktails and awesome venue. It's situated on island and all the way into the far end of the island. Food was lovely and everything was smoothly organised.
3
Indians can adjust for breakfast,even though they have idli,vada, paratha, and so on but no much tasty.Dont try lunch and dinner cos you will soon realise how much poorer you have become in a short span of time
5
This has to be one of the best breakfast buffets that I can recall. I enjoyed yummy and varied breakfasts 5 days in a row. We also ate at a few of the dinner buffets - great for kids and they also provide kid sized buffet table with kid friendly options if desired. These were also very good - themed, plenty of food, good variety, great desserts
5
We loved this hotel, we only spent 3 nights here, but never the less, we enjoyed it. The breakfasts were wonderful, lots of variety and choices. We also had dinner on one of the nights there, it was local food night. We focused mainly on the Malay food, the freshly made Satays were amazing
4
We stayed here in July 2014 with 2 children (aged 4 & 6). We had a pool view room on the 3rd floor. The room was a standard size (with a king bed and a fold out sofa bed for the kids) and spotlessly clean when we arrived. And I must mention here that the housekeeping was amazing! Our room was meticulously cleaned everyday by Joanne...even to the point of straightening all our children's colouring books and pencils each day! The pool is fantastic with a paddling pool and a bigger pool and the kids loved the water slides too. The gardens around the hotel are immaculate and it's such a lovely tropical feel. The staff were lovely, polite and obliging always, from the reception to the pool bar staff. The breakfast buffet was the most comprehensive I think I have ever come across in all my travels! The kids loved the "kids corner" where everything is at kids height so they can serve themselves. Noodle bar, curry station, fruit selection, cereals, eggs benedict station, pastries, cheeses, salad bar, pancakes, waffles, smoked salmon...you name it, they had it! The kids did kids club one day which they also loved. Would highly recommend this hotel while staying on Sentosa
5
Stayed for 1 night at the hotel to celebrate husband's birthday. Impressed by Front desk staff Gina arranging for a birthday cake for hubby. Bar in room is complimentary for the first round. Pool was awesome as life jackets for kids are provided. Great for kids who can't swim but would like to venture into deep pool. Saw as many as 3 lifeguards around the pool area. Beds were comfortable to sleep on. Breakfast was good. Would definitely return again!
4
Sentosa is an artificial island and the nature itself is not spectacular, but Shangri La hotel restaurant is worth visit. We went there with out kids and had a long and lovely Sunday brunch. They have a good variety of food in nice environment. Service is also excellent. There's some activity for kids also. Even though this place is quite expensive I am sure I will visit again
4
We can only recommend the Sunday lunch, a very nice venue and the food is great and service fantastic. The entertainment make it a special afternoon.The only set ack is guests who do not respect the dress-code and come in pool gear with noisy kids
5
We went to the cafe for buffet breakfast and it was wonderful.1. Wide spread of food that is good quality2. Super good service even though the cafe was packed3. Attentive and helpful staff who are friendly and informativeWe had a wonderful time
