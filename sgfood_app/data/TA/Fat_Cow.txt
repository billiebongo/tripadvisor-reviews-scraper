Great food, great atmosphere. A little pricey but excellent quality in food, service and overall dining experience.
3
Food was good - though it's not worth coming here without the 1-for-1 deal from the entertainer app. With the kind of price tag the restaurant is donning i feel the service was somewhat lacking and the staff could be better trained.
3
Food was nice, it's not worth going without the 1-for-1 deal from entertainer app though. The service was mediocre for restaurant with high of price tag on its menu - staff could be trained more
4
Definitely a must try at least once in your life! The steak was really melt in your mouth kind. I don’t really like fatty steaks but this was so good!
5
Service was top notch. The waiter/ waitress are responsive. The beef is of good quality but pricey. Very well done, ordered A4 ribeye @ medium rare....it just melts in the mouth. Will definitely return again and nice ambience.
4
Tried the premium donburi which I’ve been stalking at instagram and verdict: so so good. Anything with foie gras included its always always good. We ordered the ox tendon which i think is a must try item. The okura and tempura side dishes was mediocre. Sukiyaki with A3 sirloin was decent. Price is steep but justified considering the items in their menu is kf high quality. Good for special occasion. Service was good and ambience of the restaurant was private and warm
3
Would've given 5 stars just for food taste but deducted 2 for: 1) atmosphere which was stuffy to the point of perspiring and that wasn't comfortable since you have to dress up to dine here 2) average service attention All this even when the section we were in wasn't full house and given the price point charged here, a level of expectation was definitely set which wasn't met.
4
Tried the premium wagyu donburi and the wagyu striploin. The donburi is marvelous and the wagyu melts in the mouth. The A3 wagyu striploin somehow is overcooked and less tender even though we asked for medium rare. It wasn't evenly cooked, some part tougher, some part melts in the mouth. Unlike the wagyu steak in the premium donburi which was excellent. Service is great and prompt. Price is slightly steep but it is still worth it
5
Fat Cow doesn’t disappoint and is worth every cent. I am currently only able to eat cooked beef, and even though I had to cook it in the hot soup to ensure it was thoroughly cooked, it was so tender, unlike normal beef that gets tougher the longer you cook it! The beef they serve are of premium quality. I am only speaking for the beef though. The waiter who served us was also great in his service. As we were due to rush off for a concert after dinner, he helped us hurry the kitchen and even advised us to leave earlier so we could beat the crowd on the way to the concert
5
The sashimi quality was exquisite. The selection of Wagyu beef was wide an the cooking was done to perfection as per my request. Also good wine selection. I do not agree with reviews which call this restaurant overpriced. That kind of quality ingredients have their price. I actually found the price readonabl
5
Service was good, the food was great. Had the A5 ribeye, feels like the meat melted in my mouth. Will definitely be back!
5
We had the yummy wagyu cube and foie Gras don set lunch, an excellent sirloin steak and Fat Sour cocktails. All pretty great but the star.... the star was definitely the wagyu sashimi.
Tender, flavourful, served with salt crystals, it was a spiritual experience.
4
Very good quality beef.
Fresh sashimi.
Excellent service.
Pricing is on the high side but it’s worth it.
5
The 16-course lunch omakase (counter seating) carefully prepared by the head chef definitely leave my tummy happy and looking forward to a next visit soon.
3
Was given a non-counter seat and the area felt very crammed. Food portion was small but pretty tasty. Service could be better for the price paid. Called them multiple times and no one picked up. Not worth it without any discount/lunch set
5
The beef was absolutely delicious. If you don't want a bloody sight, medium well would serve you better. Please use the entertainer app too to make it all value-for-money.
5
I visited with my wife last saturday.
It might not be convenient to visit this place if you take public transportation.
Overall atmosphere was very cozy. All dishes were served propelry and it was really nice.
I may visit this restaurant again.
3
Had tried most of their food there and the only dish that had us kept going back for more is the fat cow premium donburi... service was good... but the phone reservation service is really hard to get through...
2
Pricing was mid range. Service was lacking and staff seems very cocky. I came to know of this restaurant all thanks to my purchase with the entertainer app. I think this (entertainer app) played a very significant part to the service given. I did write a note saying it's my boyfriend's bday and for them to allocate better seatings. I was given cramped up seatings that's it. For the price paid, I would rather head to black cow even though there's no special promo going on there. Food is average and portion is little. Sukiyaki was a tad too salty and I had to pay $10 for water. Definitely won't be recommending to others. First and last visit.
5
Brought the wife for the 10 course omakase dinner for our anniversary. The food was excellent and very well crafted and well paced and complementary to one another. Restaurant is located in Camden Medical Centre on the first floor which is nicely secluded. It wasnâ€™t crowded on a Tuesday night but I still booked on Chope in advance. The chef was skilled and friendly from Japan. The sushi, foie gras and the prawns were excellent as was the beef. The next time will want to try the Ala carte beef menu
1
Sat there with a guest from overseas for 15mins and no one even greeted us or at least served water. Worse, a staff smiled and acknowledged my attempt to get his attention, but moved on.
4
I love wagyu beef and foie gras bowl. The one here is extrememlh yummy. And comes with uni - another of my favourite! Come here and eat it for that oomph!
4
The sake pairing probably enhances the overall experience
Food menu remains the same as 2 months ago...probably good if omakase menu gets updated with 'season'
3
Decent food and ambience was decent. Service was quite decent and the pacing of the food was decent.
4
Whether you book as lovers or as co-workers, you will have a great meal
Just make sure that you budget for it
Bon appétit!

this restaurant needs a serious rethink about its entire service and food philosophy. The food is overpriced, served in miniscule portions and service is pathetic. Staff who should be hidden behind large soundproof doors roam freely behind the counter. No one smiles and there is no conversation from them. The whole place is like a feeding station and lacks the ambience expected from a restaurant with these prices. Pay your bill and leave and i challenge you to even garner a goodbye from anyone there. Patheti

Food at Fat Cow was delicious, however the initial table that we were given was really not suitable for a family gathering of 7 (they gave us the bar seats) as it made it difficult to converse. However, the staff soon provided alternative arrangements after I raised my concerns. They also provided an additional birthday cake which was kind of them.
4
frankly the price is expensive ( even with the entertainer app) and its not as good as the beef i had in Japan, but this place serves the best beef in Singapore ( in my opinion). the slow cooked ox tendon with daikon and foei gras is awesome! the only issue i had with this dish is there is not enough daikon! yummiest ever!
4
All menu seems so delicious. We decided to order sashimi and wagyu donburi with some foegra uni caviar and egg (yes all that!) which is super delicious. The only problem is there is not enough staff there to immediately attend your request to have more tea or to order mor

I had visited this restaurant with my partner to celebrate his birthday. Given that he loves meat, especially beef, I brought him here. We had their lunch sets since they are more affordable. The sets came with a pretty good salad and chawanmushi but the seaweed soup was a little too salty. For our mains, we got the Fat Cow Donburi (Wagyu beef slices with onsen egg) as well as the Wagyu Beef cubes + foie gras donburi. If you're not such a lover of pure meat on its own, I think it's a better option to go for the beef cubes + foie gras as it's tastier with the sauce. But if you do love meat on its own, then go ahead with the standard option as it is still good! The onsen egg was LOVE. The lunch set ended with a scoop of honeycomb vanilla ice cream which was really yummy too. We had some Japanese umeshu and fruit liquour so the meal ended up a little more expensive for 2 lunch sets. Still, I think the pricing is still quite steep altogether. But otherwise, the experience and the service you get there is pretty awesome
5
Love the ambience with excellent food and service. A lovely touch with Birthday cakes and of course the excellent singing of Happy Birthday from the lovely staff.
5
We visited for their famous lunch sets and we left thoroughly satisfied. Definitely a value for money meal!
5
Had our end of 2017 lunch there. Excellent food. I selected the Sushi Moriawase lunch set which was good value. We also ordered the Saga Grade A3 Striploin, Miyazaki Grade A4 Striploin, raw tofu skin with sea urchin and the Mototaro Sashimi Salad to share.
5
This was my 4th visit and it has lived up to standard every time. Service was great and staff were thoughtful when catering for requirements.
5
Saga steak were fabulous, also the beef bowl with caviar and foei grass so delicious, They also provide set lunch menu with incluce salad and soup as well, will definately comeback.
5
Fantastic service and food. The beef was perfectly done, and we loved the premium donburi. Definitely a must try.
5
Attentive service from beginning to end of our lunch. Very knowledgeable team with great recommendations for our lunch! Will be back to try other dishes!
5
the omakase lunch is focused on great seafood and for our lunch, there were 2 beef (which is what Fat Cow is most famous for!) dishes. A joy to watch the chef meticulously and adeptly prepare our dishes. Will look forward to visiting Fat Cow again to try out their wagyu beef main courses!
4
I went to The Fat Cow for a business lunch with another half a dozen of business associates. I had the "Fat Cow Donburi". It was quite good actually. The steak was cooked at medium doneness. It was tender and still managed to maintain most of its moisture and taste. Most of my associates appreciates it too. The portion was on the smaller side given the price tag of $45++.Nevertheless, a thumbs up for the meal. I will definitely want to go back to try their Fat Cow steak
5
The food (especially the Wagyu) was delicious. The grilled veggies were delicious too but one must definitely try their signature dishâ€”which obviously is cow. The steak was cooked to perfection, and absolutely melted in our mouths. The service is also excellent, and my husband very much enjoyed the birthday dessert.
5
I’m getting fat eating at fat cow! Food is of really high quality, fresh and absolutely delicious. Will come back for more next time!
2
Food was so-so. Perhaps expectations were too high. Not worth the value despite paying for the set lunches. It’s good we didn’t go for the dinner ala carte
4
As the restaurant name suggests, the place specializes in beef. It’s a busy place so make sure you book before you going. It is quite authentic the food. However, food here aren’t cheap. Couple of dishes can easily cost more than couple of hundreds dollars.
5
the food was delicious as usual. service was good, even though they made a mistake with one of our orders but they were so apologetic about it. that said, we did enjoy that "wrong order" because it was quality dish as well.
4
Expectation and price tally. Is not cheap but totally worth it. The seating are in Japanese style - all seating facing the chef which I personally think that is not very suitable for a romantic dinner.
5
The food was amazing in taste but the price was also high. Paying for quality I guess. We had a good time and my friends rated their meals 9-10 out of 10!
5
We had the rice bowl with beef and the cheapest beef in the menu. although the beef portion is a bit small , it was really the best beef i ever had. the rice bowl is more filling with the most delectable rice ever. Its so good that we polished off the whole bowl. Quite ex but ok if use with entertainer app
5
Very delicious & beautiful Omakase lunch The kids loved it so are the adults. Especially applause on the pickled chrysanthemums..something different from usual pickled ginger. Chef Shigeru explained on each dish being served and how it should be eaten with etc so as the wait staff, Mark. Everything is fresh & it looked modern as compared to other places that we had Omakase before that served traditional dishes. Loved to try all different Restaurants Omakase in the island. Definitely will be back on my next trip back to Sin
4
It was our first time there so we took the recommendation of the server and ordered the Wagyu Soboro Don, and the Fat Cow donburi. Both also came with Onsen egg, chawanmushi, salad and miso soup since we had the set lunch. The Fat Cow Donburi was really good, the wagyu was juicy and done really well. The minced beef one was so-so, and it had a tinge of alcohol taste which wasn't to my liking.I thought that the green tea was exorbitant tho at $5++ per person.Having just returned from Hokkaido, we also missed having Uni, and ordered an ala carte of it. It was good, but we were sort of expecting a larger portion or a better quality given it's price.Also, when you're there for the set lunch, they have you sitted at counter seats where you could watch the chef prepare food. However, I thought it would be better if we could choose the seats tho, I was sort of planning a little surprise date with my fiancé and wished we could be seated face to face instead.All in all, a good experience for a Xmas Eve lunch. Wagyu was good, just stick with it. :
5
4th time at Fat Cow, and the service is great!Ambience is very suitable for a date. There are different sections for dining, and thus keeping the noise level down.A separate bar area is in the premise as well.Must try are there A5 and A4 beef
5
Excellent food with great experience! It was quite a treat for our first omakase. The chef shared with us the makings of the dishes and the waiter was humorous as well. Glad that we made the right choice.
3
After a pleasant first experience, I went back to try a different dish - their famous wagyu don. For the price tag, we were expecting to be wowed but we ended up kinda disappointed. Beef tasted normal and we could get better ones elsewhere.
4
The wagyu beef was tender but not well flavoured. The restaurant was also under staff and every cup refill took a lot of time. This was during lunch time on a weekday
4
The food was really awesome - try the Fat Cow Donburi - the beef was done really well. Setvice left much to be desired and spoilt the experience - getting our order wrong, missing one order, making us wait, serving us melted dessert
5
Omakase and sake pairing was splendid! For business lunches would be great if there is a separate room where the chef can also prepare the food in front of us.
4
Good restaurant, the customer service can be better. Initially arrive early but they say they do not have any tables. However when I step in 5 mins later, there is a lot of empty tables.
5
Best steak I've had! The premium donburi was also well worth every cent! It's not cheap but I would return every year for a special ocassion :)
5
Excellent food and ambiance. Good service too. Provide us with a extra piece of birthday cake and ice cream.

Plus points:- It's hard to go wrong with premium wagyu. We had 2 of the premium wagyu mains. They were quite good. Do top up for the hobayaki style, which is a warm red miso dip in a magnolia leaf. - Fat cow seems to have some sort of promotion frequently available. In this case we got 1 for 1 mains. (That said, in my opinion it is not worth my while to pay full price.)Minuses:- The service is confused and slow. We had to chase for tea 3-4 times before it finally arrived. We also had to chase for the opportunity to order (2-3 times). This was a big dampener. - the aircon didn't appear to be working. We gave feedback early and were told that 'we will do something about it'. But it stayed very warm throughout, so much so that we were sweating.- they ran out of complimentary parking. It's really the little things which show a restaurant up. - the onsen egg with fried bone marrow fish is a farce. Please do not order it. The bone marrow had none of the umami of bone marrow. Quite honestly we thought it was likely just a little bit of fried fat. There was a ton of seaweed that wasn't very fresh
4
We had a cosy lunch, ordered 2 starters (Momotaro tomatoes, and crab cakes) and 2 mains and 2 drinks. Bill was shy of $300.00.We were told they need the table back in 1.5hrs, food came on time but the bill took quite a while.Food quality : never failed
5
The place had a great atmosphere and the service was really great.it was a great experience and would definitely visit again
5
Excellent dinner, wonderful atmosphere. The premium donburi was definitely a highlight, but the steaks we saw them grilling looked good too! Lunch is perhaps better value if you can make it!
5
We ordered the premium wagyu donburi and it came out perfect. We visited this place multiple times and this place never fails us.
3
We ordered the ala carte premium Wagyu beef don with foie gras, Uni and onsen egg and were terribly disappointed. The beef was lacking in beef taste and the quality was not a massive upgrade from what was offered in the regular set menu.
5
The staff are polite and friendly. We had the premium beef bowl where the food is fresh and well-cooked. The area where we were seated was a bit dark. We got to use the entertainer app and enjoyed 1-1 discount which makes it worth it to go
5
Hmmm hands down one of the best steaks we've ever had! The servers are really sweet and offer great, personalised service. They do not shy away from holding conversations with the patrons. We liked the environment and my girlfriend was wonderfully delighted with a small set of desserts for her birthday. One major draw back is the price point, even though we used a one for one coupon for the mains. That said, we were truly pampered, in the heart and in the tummy. We may return to Fat Cow again for the food and the pleasant experience.
2
I understand that expensive Japanese restaurants pride themselves on the quality of their ingredients hence the menu prices but I could not find the value for money in the meal that my husband and I had. The tempura was so so, gohan doesn't seem like authentic Japanese rice, even the wasabi didn't seem fresh. The sashimi though was fresh and steak melts in your mouth.Overall I think there are much tastier Japanese restaurants that I'd be willing to pay for than this unfortunately
5
Little miniature black balls of salty goodness (caviar) - checkCreamy orange-y slices of velvet wonder (sea urchin) - checkPerfectly seared liver with the slightest of crunch before it simply disappears on your tongue (foie-gras) - checkRunny yellow gold (egg) - checkBeautifully pink-in-the-middle slices that were a little too dry for my liking (beef) - checkAsian strength food (rice) - checkYum.Best part - beyond exceptional service.
5
Enjoyed the meal. The wagyu quality was really good. The service by the restaurant staff was good too. I had used the Entertainer app voucher, which made the entire meal even more value-for-money! Overall a very pleasant experience. Hope to come back with my family or friends again
5
For me personally this omakase experience was even more memorable than my recent taste of michelin-starred Shinji’s 真omakase (and that was stunning too)! Chef Shigeru’s creativity and balance was reflected in every dish’s unique combination of aesthetics and taste, and always with a little surprise that left me savoring and wanting more. The attentive and personable service from front-of-house staff Mark also added to the wonderful meal!
5
A very cozy place with a basement car park thus making packing very convenience. The service was excellent and the st lunch is good, value for money ! Will try the dinner next time.
5
Highly recommended! The food was awesome and the service was very good. Will consider visiting again.
4
Their premium beef donburi could be the most expensive donburi I have ever eaten in my life, thanks to the exchange rates. But it was so good, I am salivating right now, thinking about the donburi.
4
The food (wagyu/kobe beef) and drinks (cocktails/sake) are really of good quality, unique taste and awesome presentation. Good place to celebrate special occasions such as birthdays or just a get-together with family and friends for high end meal.
3
This is a lovely place to have a private dinner. However depending on what you order, it can be pricey, especially if you order the Fat Cow Sake.
5
great food. the meat was tasty., mentioned during my booking that it was a celebration for my boyfriend's birthday and they prepared something really sweet for him.
4
My boyfriend celebrated my birthday for me at Fat Cow, and the restaurant has assisted with a surprise. The beef and don were amazing, especially the don. The service was good as well. Would definitely recommend to all for a good dining experience.
4
went there earlier before prebook time slot. lucky us ale to get seats, meals were served just nice, not too fast nor slow. Good service, good food. Food wise in my opinion, i feel that the beef lunch set is better than seafood bowl. balance profile
4
Food, drinks and service was not too bad. Complimentary dessert for my dining guest celebrating the birthdayBut one minus point is the waitress did not proactively check what credit card I was holding as I only realised after I can enjoy 20% discount using UOB card which is an almost $50 saving
2
I were placed next to the BBQ island where the smell was so horrible that i could not stand it as i am pregnant and am very sensitive to smells. I requested to change to another seat and they told me they dont have any other seat without checking. In the online booking, they should have provide options for the seating. I have decided to leave if they do not have other seats for me. But in the end, they said they have seats at the omasake section. Actually, the BBQ smell travelled the entire restaurant. It smells so bad. I don't enjoy the dinner at all. The smell stuck in my clothings after i left too. I dont feel good the whole night.I also have written that the dinner was to celebrate my husband birthday. I am quite disappointed that they did not offer any small cake for him. The dinner and the overall experience dont worth the money I spent SGD562.60. I can go for some good fine dinning with this amount of money
4
Food was good though the wait was slightly longer than expected. The mushroom was unexpectedly the best dish (apart from beef)
5
Throughly enjoyed the Miyazaki Beef & Spicy salmon donburi. The chawan mushi was another star dish. Ambience was pleasant & quiet.
5
We'd never tried Fat Cow's set lunches before but their sets are well worth the money. Service was good as usual and there was even ice cream to finish.
5
Great food, great service. Beef tendon with foie gras was definitely a hit! Gave us a special cake and ice cream for a birthday :-)
5
Ambience was good. Food served fast and the meat was tender. Highly recommended for their premium wagyu donburi
5
Treated my sister to lunch here last year, reserved a lunch slot for my parents to celebrate their anniversary this year. Both occasions were met by very personable service. With the Entertainer app, it makes for a worthwhile experience at Fat Cow :)
4
Had a great lunch date for the birthday boy. The food and atmosphere were great with helpful server. The management team may want to consider making the entrance a little more conspicuous. In addition, a menu was not given till asked. I do not know if it's the culture or style of high end restaurant(as i hardly visit any), but i was a little puzzle by that particular experience.
3
I ordered the foie gras and wagyu set lunch. The foie gras was decently pan fried, however the beef was awful. The meat was pretty tough and not flavourful. Was expecting more since each set lunch was about $60 after taxes and ala carte prices were almost double that. Also, i waited very long (about 45 minutes) for my food after i placed my order. Thought this was pretty unacceptable especially since the restaurant was not crowded.
4
Really enjoyed the fusions of Asia and Steak at Fat Cow. Food was very tasty - especially the meats. Service was efficient but lacked any real warmth or customer orientation. We were rushed through and then allowed to stay at the table for dessert at the last moment. Problem here is price - 1300 SGD for four people (no wine) for a rushed dining experience and mediocre service is not right. Fix the product or fix the price but its out of kilter at the moment
4
Went there for the donburi lunch set. Considering the price off the menu to be around $100, I had rather high expectations for their rice bowls. But the beef in the Foa Gura don was surprisingly not flavourful. The Fat Cow donburi one the other hand was tasty but honestly I've had more satisfying meal worth a third of the price. Service was excellent though. Other than that I will probably not return.
4
The staffs were pretty knowledgeable in sharing their knowledge on the different kind of steaks and were pretty cordial. Only pet peeve about the experience was that no one seem to be manning the counter when I enter the restaurant.
5
Food was wonderful and service staff was attentive and nice. It is truly the best place for wagyu. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal.
1
Worst experience ever. Expensive lunch that’s straight to toilet. Management ignored my feedback.
Food is good but not if it’s unclean!
3
Food was good but nothing extra ordinary. We were disappointed with the service, ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant - restroom, entrance and dining room.
5
Food was sooooo good it made us sooooo happy. Worth every penny. Would die to go back again. Ordered A4 beef steak it just meltssss in your mouth
5
Came here for a birthday celebration. Service was great and at the end of the meal they served a little dessert with a candle. Nice little touch that made it all the more memorable. And of course the beef here is always great!
4
Service wasn’t good. Food took an hour to be served. The receptionist was rude. Overall a disappointment
4
The food here was delicious and satisfying, albeit on the expensive side. We had one main each and a side to share with an ice green tea each. The bill came up to $300.
4
Best steak I have ever tasted. However, the restaurant is rather stuffy, was sweating a little while savouring the steak!! I ordered the grade A4 ribeye and it is great! The premium donburi is definitely worth the try too! Hope that the aircon temperature can be turned down more.
4
My husband and i had the wagyu don with foie gras, and the fat cow donburi respectively .While we loved the fat cow donburi thorough - perfectly cooked slices of beef on a flavourful bowl of rice and egg, the beef with foie was a slight let down because the beef was under seasoned. when we shared our comments with the staff and asked for some salt, she attended to us immediately, providing us with some sauce and sea salt. That did the trick!
4
Everything was good but the aircon was weak. It makes dining uncomfortable. It was overall good! :))
4
My dad enjoyed his birthday lunch and surprise very much. It could have been better if service crew can be more attentive.
4
the food was good, so was the service good. ambience was also nice. the food was served quickly. little quaint place
5
Great dinning experience with a very warm atmosphere and great quality food. The quality of the beef was of fantastic quality and cooked to perfection. The price was definitely very pricey though and probably only somewhere for a special occasion.
5
My husband and i went to Fat Cow to celebrate my birthday. We ordered the cod fish and pork. Both items were very delicious. The cod fish literally melts in your mouth. The pork is very tender and savoury. We enjoyed the ambience as well. Only downside is the price but it's rather worth it for the quality of food you get.We will be back
4
This is my first time at Fat Cow and it also happened to be on my b'day month. I ordered a Fat Cow donburi set lunch that comes with salad, chawanmushi & miso soup. I love the salad because the sauce that comes with it is very much to my liking. I wish my chawanmushi is less saltier and hotter. And my miso soup to taste saltier as it was quite bland. The highlight was the Donburi, nicely seared beef slices with delicious rice but I find that the portion of the rice is too much for me, however I love the beef alot! Lastly, I was given a mini slice of cheesecake + candle + sesame icecream as my complimentary b'day dessert. Never a fan of sesame but the icecream is so good! Not too sweet and the aroma of the sesame is unforgettable. The only things that were imperfect that day was that I was seated near to a group of people who talked so loudly and it was simply disturbing to me. And I paid for a $5 cup of hot green tea when I supposed it was free as it was placed on the table when I reached there.
5
I went on a weekday for lunch with a colleague and the Chope reservation was for 1.30 pm, we had intended to eat there at 12.15 pm. Fortunately the lady at the front desk was very cooperative and arranged seating at the communal kaiseiki hall (normally reserved of Omakase dinner). We both had the Wagyu beef bowl which was par excellence.The beef was done medium style and it was so tender and juicy. The rice was nice and stick and the soft boil egg was done to perfection.
3
It was my hubby's birthday which we had our dinner celebration there for the 1st time. Despite of making reservations in 2 months in advance, we were surprised that almost half of the menu were sold out that night due to overwhelming orders from the previous day (Sat). We were forced to order ribeye steaks as those were the available ones left to order on the menu. The restaurant should have done a better job on food supply management as I was disappointed when Kobe beef was also sold out that night and my hubby did not really enjoyed the ribeye steak that night as much as he would for Kobe beef. We hope that we can have more things on the menu which are not sold out when we visit next time
5
Price is slightly on the high side but the food was real good! Went for lunch at Fat cow and had the wagyu beef cube with foie gras bowl & striploin! <3 Even the chawanmushi is so yummy! Great service provided by the staff too, with detailed explanation on the characteristics and uniqueness of each type of beef. Cozy ambience which is suitable for special occasions & group/family gatherings. Totally recommend this place!!!
5
Had a nice quiet birthday dinner with my wife. Food and service was great. Price wise a little steep but fortunately my wife had the entertainer app and had a main course free. We were seated at the counter instead of the dining table as the place was booked for a function. But it was quiet enough for a two-some dinner.
4
Came back to eat the set lunch. Lives up to my expectation. Ate the wagyu don (medium well). Love the honeycrumb ice cream to end off the meal. Will definitely be back again.
5
service was impeccable. food was varied and delicious. great with entertainer app. would return again.
5
My hubs 40th birthday was off to a great start at Fat Cow.
The service was great and intimate. The quality of food was awesome! Well done Fat Cow crew!
5
We had the Omakase sushi menu, and it was amazing! Food was delicious and chef was very professional as well. Would definitely recommend it :)
5
You know many good places that were good when they first open. But when they get popular their standards drop. Not Fat Cow.
5
My server Nora was amazing, she was very friendly and knowledgeable when it came to recommendations. She even helped surprise my girlfriend with a complementary birthday cake.
4
It was a very pleasant dining experience with good quality food. But expect to pay a premium for it.
4
Food and service was great. Except for the request of babychair in advance wasn't fulfilled due to insufficient babychair avaliable for guests.
1
Really hated this place. The first thing i noticed is that zero of the staff is Japanese, weird as this is a high end Japanese restaurant. Went for the donburi set from which the beef was overgrilled and didnt have a succulent, medium rare taste. For 55 SGD for a puny bowl this was very dissapointing. To top it off the restaurant takes the entertainer app, but apparently only for main courses (something they only highlighted after they initially accepted it). Lastly, the venue is hard to find, tucked away in a hospital. Poorest value for money in Singapore Ive had

The lunch set I had was somewhat disappointing. The offering and portions were very limited. Wished I ordered from the menu than the lunch promo.My wife had a better experience with her Wagyu cut. Maybe Sunday isn't the best time to visit Fat Cow cos the vibe was not that good and the service was very mechanical and unenthusiastic. Not sure if I'll visit again as there are so many eateries these days
5
Food is great! Fresh ingredients with great service coupled made the meal a truly enjoyable one. The beef tendons were especially good and so were the crab cakes and premium beef don.
4
food was great, best beef ever if u enjoy jap beef. atmosphere was good. service could have been better.
4
Love the beef, the quality of the food and the ambience. I must also mentioned specially about this waiter who was so cooperative and smart. To give my guest a special surprise for her birthday, he coordinate the arrangement that it was smooth.
4
The Staff were nice and friendly and attentive. The Food was good and my husband and I enjoyed our dinner
5
the beef was just right and very delicious. the salmon in the salmon bowl was fresh and sweet. the service was very good too.
5
good experience. good service. good restaurant with good food and ambience. will definitely return again.
4
Very good quality wagyu beef served by high quality staff. Would recommend for celebrating significant milestones
4
Not worth it if you're not utilizing the entertainer app. $5 for hot green tea before taxes. Food was nothing short of amazing though!
5
We ordered Donburi and Foie Gras. Both are heavenly. Both different taste but it was so delicious. Definitely a 10/10
5
Everything in the premium wagyu don was so good, the wagyu beef was well grilled, slightly salted to bring out the flavour of the beef. Foie gras was smooth and delicious. Sea urchin, egg and truffle was a delicious sticky mess :)
4
The dining experience was great however I am unsure if it justifies the cost of the meal.
The service was fantastic and we were very well looked after.
4
We were there for our anniversary. Nice food but seating was cramped. Nearby table was very noisy. It would be nice if we could be seated elsewhere.
5
Ate a wonderful donburi and my wife had a steak with the honey miso. Really enjoyed ourselves and had a sake too!
5
Come for the lunch instead of dinner, you pay lesser and you get a soup, salad, chawamushi and dessert!
5
Had a lunch reservation with Fat Cow on account of a friend's recommendation and great previous visit. I mentioned in the reservation notes that it was in celebration of my girlfriend's birthday and they went out of their way to provide a complimentary cake and polaroid to commemorate the occasion - this was on top of their impeccable service and fantastic food!Will definitely be back for more in the future
4
We've been there for lunch on Friday. The restaurant was pretty busy even it's almost 2 pm. We've ordered 3 set lunch for 2 people and nothing leftover. The sashimi set came with regular rice not the sushi one. The fish is pretty fresh and cut well but pretty normal. The grilled Gindara is very nice and tender. Fat Cow Donburi is the star. The beef is grilled perfectly, medium rare as order. It's served w/ onsen egg. The sauce is also nice. All set came with hot green tea, small salad, miso soup and Japanese steamed egg (shrimp, crab meat and scallop in side). Small scoop of Honeycomb Vanilla Ice Cream is also included in the set. It's pretty busy here during lunch time so make sure u reserve the table
4
Visit Fat Cow on a weekday to celebrate a birthday. Made an reservation for 1st seating and as stated prior, that we have to clear table by 8pm. Had A4 grade beef and was good, and at $290 for 300g, we definitely paid a premium price for it. Great food and service.
5
Premium wagyu beef is very expensive but it's amazingly good beef. They have set lunch which is not bad at all. If it's your first time to visit, I suggest you get their set lunch menu. Next time you visit, you will be ready for their premium beef cuts. We tried their Ohmi ribeye and it was super delicious. Service was good. It was my son's birthday and they gave us a special cake w/ ice cream for my son and ice cream for us.
2
The service was very poor and makes the whole experience rather disappointing. For such a pricey restaurant, one would expect a little more then just good food. The food was good but one can get that kind of food easily in Singapore. I would imagine Fat Cow would position itself as a high end restaurant but the experience eating there did not reflect so. It is a restaurant which I would be reluctant to recommend a family member or friend.
4
Enjoyed the meal at Fat Cow as expected - beef is of good quality and is well handled by the chefs. Together with counter seats to enjoy seeing your food made, it makes for a satisfying experience. Staff could be slightly more attentive, otherwise service is perfectly acceptable. Going to this restaurant means you are not shy about spending money, but one expects this for premium ingredients, atmosphere, and culinary skill. The only single gripe: the tea served, 'Sencha', is ordinary and very overpriced.
5
ordered the fat foa gura don and it was fantastic. ambience of the restaurant is good with view of the chefs working in the central area. service was prompt.
5
the wagyu steak is great, the staff is friendly. it can be crowded on weekends so best to go weekday nights.
4
We had to make reservations 2 weeks in advance as they were perpetually full for dinner. We had the chutoro and uni sashimi which was excellent. Ordered 2 different cuts of wagyu beef and it was awesome, perfectly cooked to what we requested. Pricey dinner so only visit if you wanna splurge
1
Was highly recommended by friends, but the food is below average for the prices that we were paying. The iberico pork was really dry, and the hot pot came in a really worn out gas stove (the kind you will find at your neighbourhood steamboat joints), which totally spoilt the ambience of the place. Staff were inattentive, and were more bothered in their own conversations than coming to check on our table
5
The Fat Cow Donburi set lunch is very good for value.The wagyu beef is char-grilled to perfection and reasonably portioned. Had the Satsumaimo (Japanese sweet potato) too and it was pretty tasty with portion good enough for 2 to 3 people to share. Restaurant ambience is relaxed and cosy, providing an escape from the bustling city. Staffs are very attentive and helpful. A very satisfying meal
4
Enjoy the cosy atmosphere of a near traditional japanese restaurant in Singapore Menu is varied and the freshness of raw fish will impress you. So will the tenderness of beef with a very precise ability to cook it how you want it done1 improvement: Wine list could be a bit more sophisticated Bon appÃ©tit
5
We've been here 3 times now and it's remarkable how it's maintained its excellent food quality through the years. The sushi was good (especially for $50 in a set!), the fat cow don did justice to its namesake (it was excellent!), and the carabinero prawn was out of this world.
3
We were recommended this place, even though it didn't really get a stellar rating on Trip Advisor.....we booked but when we showed up they didn't have a reservation for us, and there is actually a dress code which we also didn't know about... so the hostess gave us a hard time.......which really set the evening off really well - NOT!The meat was pretty good, which you would expect for a place that claims to specialize in Japanese steak.....They have a pretty decent menu but the the prices are not really worth it.....as a lover of Japanese food, there are a lot better places in Singapore from a price point perspective....Its a decent place. The service was pretty good and the food ok, nothing really special.The Kegani crab cakes were pretty oily and tasteless for Sin $32.00, you got two.....Sin$16.00 each....kind pricey for a oil infested crab cake......Four slices of meat was Sin $92.00.....to be part of the Shabu Shabu. To get extra meat you had to have the whole Shabu Shabu set gain.....Other items for dinner were pretty bland including the ox tendon, which was a hot appetizer.I have to say overall, I didn't really enjoy the meal.Wasn't a place that i would rush back to..
4
With such a name, it results quite obvious that Beef is actually the restaurant specialty. However when the noble material is treated the Japanese way, it ends-up being a masterpiece, a delicious treat.Went there for lunch and was proposed to sit in the common dining room, which offers seats overlooking directly the chef working behind the counter, which for me was much more captivating.Beef is the star here and you may customize your steak orders down to the meat of your choice, weight and preparation.An extended range of meat dishes is proposed (with extensive range of prices as well :) , and very good set lunch proposals at around 50$.Give it a try 
1
Came to the restaurant with high hope but ended cutting short. Chutoro was dry and tasted worst than what you get from a sushi bar conveyor belt. Uni - tasted stale.Wagyu beef that this restaurant is known for seemed to come from unfinished portion from previous dinner - cold, dry, disgusting. It went downhill from here .... grilled brinjal which was recommended as an accompaniment to the beef, was served last Desert - a melted smash of ice cream .... Overall; it's an over rated, fast food disguised as Japanese fine dinning.
3
Good quality beef n Japanese cuisine but too expensive . Ambience so so , moreover space a bit too tight for comfort .
Definitely not worthy of a re visit .
4
The fat cow donburi was really delicious especially when you mix the onsen egg with the rice because the wagyu is cooked to perfection
4
I had the FatCow premium donburi. Wagyu steak slices, foie gras, uni (sea urchin) and caviar. All atop a bowl of rice. Oh, and an onsen egg. Decadence in a bowl. At $98. Nevertheless, it tasted like a little bit of heaven. Also, the yuzu sorbet they serve is really palate cleansing.
2
Food is mediocre at best, seasoning for the don buri was a bit heavy handed and thus every mouthful was a tad too salty. Service was slow and we had to remind them to bring us condiments ever so often.Low on the value for money spectrum, unfortunately in Singapore i think there are many other places with better quality and Flavours
3
Decided to take the family here for dinner after hearing so much about this place. Had the crab cakes costing $32 which came with 2 small palm sized patties. It was tasty but nothing extraordinary and certainly not on par with what you get at Morton's for the same price. We also ordered the truffle sea bream but it never came. So not able to comment on that other than omission by the staff.The flagship main course of Premium Donburi at $98 per bowl was good and tasty but at that price, I would expect a lot more. For what we got, I would say a fair price for that would be closer to $60. Overall a decent meal but overpriced in my view at over $700 (>$140 per head) inclusive of 2 beers (which were a 1 for 1 deal). You can get 95%-110% of the quality elsewhere for under 50% of the price. Good for a try, but not a revisit
5
The Fat Cow Donburi — Charcoal-grilled wagyu beef with onsen egg and shredded leeks over rice — was awesome. And lunch was great value too at about SGD 50.The beef was beautifully pink and the slow-cooked onsen egg was excellent. Hope to be back for Fat For-Gura Don — Glazed foie gras and Wagyu cubes over rice
4
I visited with my wife for a quick lunch.The food was very good, we enjoyed a set lunch of Sushi and the other Chirashi Zushi along with a half cut side of grade A3 tenderloin (S$98++)The food was all top quality and the service also on point.Worth a visit but just the once though
4
The beef is excellent, expensive yes, but worth it. Absolutely perfect cooking too. But the problems were: the rest of the food is overpriced, the crab cakes and zucchini flowers were very average and so expensive, and the staff pushes very hard for you to order as much of the beef as possible, my server kept saying it wasn't enough so we ended up with easily more than we wanted. My partner praised their set lunch menu, so maybe stick to that....a one time visit I think
1
Used to love this restaurant very much for its high standard of beef. However, my last visit to the restaurant yesterday was a disappointment. First, the manager seemed to be distracted when serving us which eventually landed us with 3 main dishes with 2 of us. He did not repeat our orders. We were partly to blame but that was not all. We ordered a Wagyu and an Aged beef. It came cold unlike the usual warm. The Aged beef was very dry. When asked the waitress said that aged beef tends to be dry. The fish was pretty normal like those from restaurant chain but caused us $48. Worst of all, the place was nosy with a group of men throwing foul languages and talking loudly as if they are drunk. Not the kind of standard I would expect from a restaurant that has dress code. For the price of near $500 for 2 pax, I would expect more. Time for me to move on
2
Visited the restaurant on 19 February for dinner. Ordered the cod fish which was $48++. I had expected the dish to come with at least a side dish. Instead, it was only 2 small pieces of fish on a small plate served with a short strip of ginger. We were initially seated at a table which was separated from the next table with only a thin see-through screen. (The tables were placed side by side with no gap except for the screen.) We could hear every word that the diners said, despite them speaking in soft tones. How the restaurant expect diners to have a proper meal seated like that was really beyond me. Even the food courts have tables with a decent distance in between them.(Luckily, the restaurant agreed to let us change seats as there were plenty of empty tables.
4
Kid friendly place with attentive and helpful staff. Food was so good & worth every cent & calorie! Def coming back again!
3
Very expensive steaks which were of good quality. However, the service was sub par and this made the experience less than enjoyable especially for the price range of the restaurant. Overall, could definitely get better value for money somewhere else.
3
Dunno why its no wifi where the food is so expensive. Invest a little wont hurt. Maybe because they assume that everyone got internet on their phone so they wont invest at all. Food is good.
5
After reading the reviews online we decided to give Fat Cow a try. It is an unforgettable dinner. The ambience is good giving us the experience of eating somewhere away from the urban crowd where our focus is to relax and enjoy the food. The Sliced Bream with Black Truffle is really good. When it reached our table the truffle fragrance will permeates your sense of smell and continues to linger after consuming the entire dish in one go. It is really tasty! Next we ordered the must eat Wagyu - Ohmi A4 Ribeye and Saga Tenderloin A3. Follow the suggestion from the waitress on the doneness - Medium Ohmi and the way to eat the sliced delicacies presented to us dipping on both the sea salt and sauce, we can feel the meat melting on contact with our lips. We have no idea Wagyu can be cooked into such tastiness. After the fantastic main course we had dessert. Warabi Mochi is a must try. It feels like Super soft Jelly layered with black sugar syrup. Dipped with matcha and soy powder, it brings a complete and satisfying closure to our meals. Do not hesitate to ask the host on the food you are consuming, they will explain how it is made and which is an education in itself.

Went in December with a business partner for lunch at 12pm but arrived slightly late at 12:15pm. We were told to turn over the table at 1:30pm and we immediately ordered 2 beef, OHMI 150g and Tochigi 150g. The waitress recommended 'The Fat Rice' and I ordered grill asparagus and HIMI udon.Firstly, I preferred the beef to be thinly sliced. 150g is actually quite a big portion. The beef is juicy, but turns cold quite easier when you are half way into the meal. HIMI Udon is not bad, Asparagus can be missed and The Fat Rice is nothing special (the gravy can be more).What I didn't like was the way the waitress hinted it's time to turnover the table. Without us asking the bill, they presented it while we are still half way into the meal. That's quite distasteful for a restaurant with this price tag. The portion of beef can be challenging within an hour. Certainly they can anticipate it will take longer and could do better with their reservations allocations.Overall, the quality of the beef is wasted due to the air-conditioning. The plate is not hot enough to keep it warm throughout
5
As my spouse loves beef and having returned from japan ... what better to way to celebrate the birthday by dining at a recommended japanese restaurant in Singapore.We chose the grade of beef we wanted ... of course went for the A5 ...the most expensive.To truly enjoy good beef....BE prepared to spend. Cost for a couple USD400.On the whole, a wonderful dining experience out of Japan
4
had the set lunch and were very good, thought it was pretty value for money, i ordered the wagyu foie gras, and for 48, got a salad, chawan mushi, your main and ice cream for dessert. Although oddly located in a hospital, it may be a little difficult for tourist travelling without a data plan to get out of there
4
We ordered the set lunches (fat cow don) & (foie gras don). It was good and the smokiness flavour was really strong for mine. Wagyu cubes with the foie gras was not as tender and smoky as compared to the Wagyu slices. Service staff waitress (Filipino) was good but the other server (Chinese) pulled a Long face throughout. Overall a good experience
4
Go for the meat - it is excellent. And if you sit at the counter it is prepared right in front of you by skilled japanese chefs. Service is good and prompt. Dishes served in order of readiness not necessarily how your ordered them, but everything is fresh and their Hanami signature cocktail just brilliant. The location at the ground floor of the medical centre somewhat odd but once inside you dont notice this - the ambiance is cool and modern
4
Visited the restaurant during dinner time. Upon entering the restaurant, we were promptly ushered to our seats and the waitress provided some recommendations on what we can have for our meal. The staff was very knowledgeable and provided good recommendations.Both of us enjoyed the sliced bream with black truffle and seasoned kelp, as well as, the grade A5 ribeye from Iwate Prefecture. The sliced bream is served raw and is, what we think, the perfect dish to kick off our dinner. The doneness of the ribeye was spot on. The sea salt and sauce was a great companion to the top grade Wagyu beef! We also order the Kurobuta pork. However, that didn't wowed us and the meat was tough.Waiting staff was attentive; water was topped up and empty plates were cleared almost immediately. Keep up the good work
4
Dined with friends yesterday evening
Attentive and pleasant service
Nice size menu to chose from
Size of portions was typically Japanese and pretty small
Quality of food good, especially the Crab cakes.
Quite pricey.
Would go back but not too soon
4
Wondering if everything here is perfect because it certainly seemed this way. Set lunches are great value for money & very delicious. Will be back!
5
Besides the foodgasmic menu...Hands down, the best Japanese beef I've had in Singapore. After two months of coming over to work here, was truly a slice of heaven - brought me back to Kobe in Japan. Great atmosphere and good sake too, would recommend for friends and business partners alike.
3
The food is ok. Fairly good. Portions are small. Maybe that's the Japanese side of things. But in the end what I didn't like stacked up more than what was just ok for me. First, the menu is one page so not extensive. That's fine really, until you tell me this and that's not available and I'm at the first seating of the night. So the two items that were not available, were guess what? The two items I wanted to order for my dinner. So BAH! Then service was ok but not great. Then there's supposed to be complimentary parking (for dinner it's not really expensive to park there just below $5) but I was told, oh I have to check because we are maybe out of the evening complimentary parking. AGAIN, I'm dining first seating of the night and the restaurant is barely half full. Then she never came back to let me know if that was available. The food is not so wonderful that I'd go back again. Maybe if I had the two dishes I wanted to order but then again, maybe they'd still be out of it. So yeah, all in all not impressed on any front
4
We had set lunches - the grilled sliced wagyu beef set and the foie gras and beef cube set. Besides these, we also ordered the grilled sweet potato which is tasty but a little expensive ($14 for 4 slices) and a half-cut Ohmi grade 4 ribeye ($120) which is reasonably priced. The marbling of the beef was just right and the feel that it gave was very satisfying. As for the set lunches, they were worthy and we hope to be back to try a few other sets. As the usual honeycomb ice cream had ran-out, we were offered matcha ice cream which we both don't eat, however, the waitress saved the day by changing them to yuzu sorbet after learning that. Kudos! Happy birthday to me
4
Had lunch at Fat Cow with a group of 10. we each got a lunch set plus 2 full steaks to share.As usual the chawanmushi was really delicious, most of us had the wagyu don & it tasted so good!The full steaks were extra juicy & well cooked, though we really hoped for a bigger portion for the price we were paying.Otherwise a great lunch
4
Yesterday I had lunch with 3 friends in Fat Cow and we each made a different selection from the set lunch menu (which is quite extensive) Service was very quick, starters, salad and soup coming before the main dishes arrived and free flowing hot green tea. My friends advised me that the beef dishes were really nice, the tempura looked good and my tonkatsu was just right for a not too heavy lunch. Delicious ice cream for dessert was timely and just the right dish to end the meal.Reservations are recommended for both lunch and dinner
4
The meal was fantastic. I ordered the A5 ribeye which was out of this world. My colleague ordered the Australian Wagyu flatiron. Both of which had unbelievable flavor. We also ordered Sake and several of the ones we wanted were not available and the person most knowledgeable and no idea what to serve us after 6 tastings. A far cry from our recent visit to Tokyo that provided for unbelievable selection and execution for our tastes. The service was below average and we had a "Trainee" serve us. Hard to spend that much money for a dinner and have a "Trainee" serve us. I asked her if her name was Trainee and she said "no". Ok. Enough said. Location is weird and in a medical building off the beaten track - which is fine, but the service needs a serious upgrade to coincide with the food.
3
So this is a nice quiet place to come on Sunday evenings where a lot of other places are closed. We had shabu-shabu; grilled beef; sukiyaki. Since time, they have increased their sashimi mix. Best dish was the maguro on beancurd - excellent. Service was slow
3
A quiet location away from the hustles of Orchard Road. Menu was interesting and on the expensive side. Ordered black cod which was very good but had no sides. By the time you add rice and vegetables it came to well over $60 without any starters and drinks. If your choose the beef dishes it would cost you a lot more. The dinner "sets" started at $128 per person. It really was not special enough to justify the high prices. Service was slow: hot tea was poured once and never refilled until asked for by the time we were paying the bill. (Tea was extra by the way @$5 per person). Unlikely to recommend this restaurant to our friends
5
It is my favourite Japanese restaurant in Sg and it never fails to meet our expectations! I'm in love with their food and atmosphere! Very classy restaurant!
3
Recommended to come here for lunch. More value for money..
Beef is good.
Service is good.
Have to reserve in advance if you ar planning a visit here.
5
What a find, what a treat, superb social dining. Amazing food and delicacies produced in front of your eyes. Service second to none!
4
Service was great.. We were very well taken care by the captain (forgot his name) He helped by suggesting what to order given our preferences. The wagyu was excellent and definitely a steak lovers paradise...Reservations are almost necessary as the place was packed even on a week day.
2
We went there with friends to experience "modern Japanese" cuisine. The setting is quite nice but the disappointment came immediately after the starter was served. Simple greens, miso soup same as in all Japanese fast food restaurants. But the main was ridiculous. Rice with so called chopped blue fin tuna on rice. Actually it was a kind of fish purÃ©e, 1mm thick...and the dessert a scoop of ice cream. This poor menu billed at 50 dollars! We won't patronise this place again
5
Went to Fat Cow for fiance's birthday celebration :) Really enjoyed the experience there. From the time we reached, all the way to the end of the dining experience, we were greeted with great service:) The waiter was considerate to ensure that we were comfortable. He was also attentive to our needs, and yet was respectful of our space. My salmon dish was a little overdone, which he offered to have it redone again (though I've already finished half of it). I rejected it, but was warmed by the thought of the restaurant in wanting to ensure that the best quality of food was given to their customers.Enjoyed the various tastes that the different dishes brought about. Bream was truffle was exceptionally delightful (though it was little). The ohmi steak was awesome =) Thanks for the birthday surprise for my fiance! I've only mentioned it casually (with no requests nor expectation for them to do anything), and yet the restaurant was thoughtful to prepare a dessert (warabimochi) and a candle at the end. Price was not cheap, but they had a new dinner set meal of some sort, which cut down the price considerably =)Would definitely go back again with my fiance
4
Dine in with my boyfriend on a weekend, as usual the restaurant was pretty packed with diners. We made a reservation in advance and requested for non-bar counter seats. Upon reaching, we were still brought to a counter seat. After clarification, they sat us at another table.Had the grade a4 ribeye wagyu and it was great! The marbled meat melts in the mouth and I love the sauce that goes along with it. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience
4
We dine there with the entertainer app, we ordered 8 main courses and paid for 4. Overall, the wagyu marbling is up to expectation.The Japanese Wagyu is nicely grilled at medium, even though half cut may not seem much, but it is actually sufficient for us as we personally find that one can get too 'sick' from the meat and fats.Shabu shabu A5 ribeye was ordered by our companion, and we will definitely go back for that. Donabemeshi is not exactly up to expectation and I personally don't think the price tag for that is reasonable. Do order the slow-cooked ox tendon that comes with foie gras. Ii goes well with the fat rice
3
Eating beef is a personal thing. Everyone thinks they can cook the perfect piece of steak. Home cooked beef in Singapore is possible with recent importers like FoodieMart/MMM.This is a Japanese themed restaurant. The restaurant is nice, comfortable and spacious. The service is polite. The green tea is $5 and is not free (didn't know till after the bill). Came for lunch for the set meals. Australian striploin with rice and onsen egg. My other companions had foie grais and beef cubes. Priced about $50 each set with salad, miso and egg custard. Not impressed. I'll cook my Australian Wagyu at home
3
After so much hype about this restaurant we finally decided to try it out with my parents here on holiday from Australia. My lovely partner had the premium A5 Wagyu, my parents the Australian Wagyu and went with the US Wagyu. We all tried some of each others and we all concluded that the only one that tasted great was the A5. Service was great, side dishes and starters nice but not wow and the deserts average. Cost for 4 pax $1,130 way over priced for the quality. Been and tried and have decided for the price we will stick with Yazawa, Cut and Morton's
5
Love the wagyu steak here, although quite pricey. Would be better if they serve some "before meal" appetizer. Atmosphere is good for dating. And great service
2
The sauces for the shabu shabu were really diluted. Meat was nice but really overpriced.
Rice only came at the end after we finished all the dishes, very puzzling
5
Would recommend this as a place to go for good wagyu & Japanese whiskies or cocktails pairing. Reservations in advance are a must.
3
After redemption on the Entertainer app we still forked up about $90 per pax. While the quality is great, it didn't really feel like an awesome deal. Great ambience, good quality beef.
3
Had an A5 steak among others . The beef was according to the way we had wanted it but I definitely not worth the S$500 we paid for 2 pax .
2
My Wife and I ordered the Wagyu beef Claypot rice priced at $78++ each before discount. After the 50% discount the meal still came out to $90+ including service and gst. Totally not worth as the portions were tiny and the amount of Wagyu given was very little. The quality of the Wagyu wasn't good either. Food was not as hot as expected from a Claypot dish. Only the rice was hot, the meat and veg was not hot.
2
We had the Donabemeshi and the US ribeye, for about $80++. The Donabemeshi, which is essentially claypot rice with wagyu beef, tasted good, but definitely not worth $40. I really wonder who/why would anyone ever order that at full price. The ribeye was a total disappointment. Even the roast beef cuts at hotel buffets tasted better
4
Only done here if you're taking advantage of the Entertainer app's one-for-one on mains deal. Otherwise the prices are exhorbitant and, in our view, totally not worth it.The husband and I went here for a birthday celebration. We ordered the half cut A4 steaks and 2 sides - rice porridge and the fat rice. After ordering, I worried that the 150g portion was too small but it actually turned out OK. The A4 is wonderfully soft and tasty with a good fat-to-meat content but I can imagine that the full cut would have been to 'jelat' for us. I savoured every bit of my half cut and wasn't hungry afterwardsThe rice porridge was yummy and was a large enough portion to be split into 2 full bowls for us to share. The fat rice was a waste of time and seemed like a rip-off to us. Don't bother with it and try another side dish maybe. There was nothing waygu about it. Since it was my birthday, they served us a small dessert of Michu and ice cream which was a nice way to end off our meal. Overall, - ambience was good. - Service was good.- A4 wagyu steak was good. - Rice porridge was yummy and large - fat rice was a waste of time and money- Price was horrendous but made better with the entertainer app
1
It was 220 pm - a greeter was working at the greeter station. I ran in, conscious of the hour and their closing time of 3. My wife and i had already selected what we would eat from the online menu.The greeter said im sorry we are closed and looked back down at her hands. I asked her ifnshe was sure, and she said yes so i left. The time was 220 and we would have eaten quickly. If last order is 2 ir 215 or 230 they should advertise the sam
4
Came here for hubby's birthday celebration. Ordered two A5 full size wagyu. It came with shoyu sauce, 3 grilled small chilli. Nil other sides. Total bill came up to 350, and that was with a 1:1 deal. Overall was a great experience tasting their best steak, but definitely not worthed full price
4
Second time here and we had A3 wagyu tenderloin. We had A4 wagyu the last time which has too much marbling for our liking. The A3 tenderloin was just nice! The sides are awesome especially the cold udon.
5
Great food, fine dine ambience, kind of tricky to locate at first. The restaurant is near Orchard Medical Center.
5
Its pricey but good quality!
I had the wagyu beef cubes with foie gras over rice, offered on the set lunch.
A hidden gem at the most unexpected place
3
Came here for lunch last week and opted for the Bara Chirashi set. It was on the whole quite good, but there were a few pieces of fish with a very strong fishy taste which I just didn't like. My companion opted for one of the beef sets, and hers was definitely a better choice. I guess the moral of the story is that it's better to stick to the steak when you visit a steakhouse
4
We had the Saga Grade A3 Sirloin, Ohmi Grade A4 Ribeye, Rangers valley F1Wagyu Flatiron, Kurobuta Ibericao, Sashimi lunch set. Also ordered the rice porridge, miso shiru, eggplant and baby spinach as sides. The beef was oh-so-tasty, melt in your mouth goodness. Kurobuta was also good, very interesting sauce. Vegetable sides were ok, but couldn't top the meat of course. Honestly, the rice porridge was the best of the sides. Super service staff, made sure to clear our dishes regularly, top up our drinks and also amazingly managed to overhear that it was someone's birthday and brought out a nice birthday treat at the end of our meal. For desserts we had the mochi and hokkaido milk. Both were good but the mochi was so good that we all wanted the last piece. As ordering ala carte might be too pricey for some, would totally recommend the lunch sets since they are definitely value for money

Apart from the good company, the food served were deliciously tasteful. I am delighted. Although the price was a bit of a steep, it is still worth a go. The sides were amazing as well, friendly service, polite and overall was a wonderful night. Thank you Fat Cow

Diners sit around an open kitchen, decorated in an authentic Japanese style. If you have sake, you get to pick your own glass to drink out of, which is really fun. Extensive menu based around the high-quality beef the restaurant is known for. The sautÃ©ed mushrooms are amazing, sashimi is really fresh and all steak is prepared faultlessly. There is not a lot of seating, so you need a reservation or be prepared to be in and out quickly. Highly recommend Fat Cow, will definitely come back

Thoroughly enjoyed a sumptuous dinner mains of Japanese Wagyu beef steak (Saga, half cut 110g) done in Sumibyaki (charcoal grilled) style. My order of medium was grilled to perfection, with the tantalising smoky charcoal smell lingering in the air, and the meat so tender it almost melts in your mouth. Pair it with a Cabernet Sauvignon and it's Wagyu seventh heaven. My side of ox tendon and foie gras (Wagyu Suji No Tare To Foa-Gura) is a refreshing combination, the texture and natural flavour of the seared foie gras was not overpowered by the dark sauce.Finished off the satisfying meal with comfort food rice porridge (Gyu-Niku Dashi Zosui). The tip from the manager was to add the dark sauce from the foie gras to the porridge, which will lift the taste of the porridge.I must say that in comparison this came close to the legendary beef steak I had in Kobe, which probably won by a nose simply because it's Kobe beef in Kobe. Else Fat Cow deserves all its accolades, just don't flinch at the price. Extra tip will be that the entertainer app offers 1-1 for mains.Will be back for their lunch sets someday, when the wallet is willing again
5
The sashimi is sooo fresh! especially the prawn, its not easy to find a fresh and sweet prawn sashimi. Its similar to what we have in hokkaido, of course the price are so much different :-). We also ordered the Iwate A5 rib eye, which they grilled for us (sumibiyaki), and its soooo tasty, even without sauces.. just the original taste of the melting fat and the tender beef itself. The spinach salad is nice with creamy sesame sauce, and we close it with gyu-niku dashi zosui which is a porridge with beef broth and egg, but its so tasty. In overall its perfect, even the coffee is nice complement, strong fragnant but not acidic.
5
At first, we were quite unsure as to what we were getting ourselves into as the restaurant is located in a hospital building.... Nevertheless, we had some seriously amazing food here and really excellent service by the wait staff. It was a friend's birthday dinner and the waiter overheard us talking so he gave us a plate of ice cream with a candle on it. What a pleasant surprise
4
This restaurant takes their wagyu cuts seriously. Counter sitting allows the experience of an open kitchen. Not cheap, but food quality is high. The lunch sets (less than 50SGD) carry good value for money. Highly recommended.
5
My second visit: the Waghu Beef grade A5 was unbelievably tasty as was the spinach and rice. Excellent unobtrusive service. Atmosphere quiet and very comfortable. Will definitely visit again.
3
The place was difficult to find it was attached right next to a hospital. We ordered two large wagu steaks, we expected to be wowed but was not, okay the meat tasted a bit different but never had that soft melt fat that melts in your mouth, not sure it's worth the price tag, a bit overrated
5
Our friends recommended this place and we tried to book for lunch but it was full. Nevertheless they called back to say they have a seating at 2pm which was good for us. We were seated at the bar and ordered the set lunch. It came with fresh salad, chawanmushi and miso soup. Really loved the salad as the dressing was really light and refreshing. I had the wagyu with egg and my wife had the wagyu with foie gras. Both were excellent in their own way. They also have good cocktails so would make a good place for pre-drinks. Overall, excellent value for lunch and highly recommended
3
We booked to sit on their Bar, which you can see how the chefs prepare their dishes. It was the first time for us and we went for their reasonable priced business lunch. We ordered their beef, which was not Wagyu, but very good indeed. It came like a Bento Box, with rice, Japanese salad, pickles, soup etc.. As well from the a'la carte Menu we ordered Tuna belly-and Salmon sushi. It was very nice prepared. We had no complaints at all and we will have lunch their again!
4
a little hard to find, beef & rice with gravy was good (claimed by BF, he eats beef and i dont)appetizer sliced bream with truffle: excellentcrab cake: so-soSalmon sashimi: so-soMains:grilled fish: excellent.i am impressed by their fish dishes even though they are suppose to be good in their beef. service wise, ok only. i think the staff should be more well trained in their Sake knowledge so that they can advice and pair a more suitable sake for patrons
1
Overpriced, very small portion for a big price tag, not just on the beef but on the sides too, a small bowl of rice with some gravy on it cost $8++4 thin slices of sweet potatoes cost $14++HALF a tomato thinly sliced cost $16++Beef was nothing to sing about either.Bring your money elsewhere, not worth it.
1
For every dish we ordered, it was like a tasteless joke. The meat is simply awful, obviously under-seasoned and chews like leather. Even a supermarket's brisket would have outshine their so-called prime steak. The sauce that came with it, assaulted my taste buds until I could not perceive other flavours. Perhaps that was the plan all along. It seems like the chefs are all vegans, or they really really hate cows. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say Fat Cow is the worst restaurant I've been to this year
5
We were lucky enough to eat here via business so did not have to pay the bill. The atmosphere is great, we were sitting at the bar t the back and watched them prepare and cook the steak. Everything we ate was delicious. We have sample plate so tasted a number of different steaks. We also did the same for entrÃ©e. Good wine list as well
3
We had lunch here, simply because it was the closest place that served beef at the time. We were seated quickly (walk in customers) and the wait staff were very friendly and efficient. We bit the bullet and ordered the highest marbled Wagu. It was very expensive but we were prepared to pay for a great steak. It looked great when arrived (we had a 300g steak each). Unfortunately it wasn't anywhere near as nice as we expected and for the price the steak was a complete dissapointment.For the price you are better off going to Cut - much better ambience and tastier Japanese beef for the same price.
5
Although a little on the pricey side, this was a great night out. Best steak In Singapore, and maybe the most fun I have had dining out in a long time. The owner is a lovely guy, and the service was fantastic.
3
Decent food, average service, effort to get to.
I was really excited to come here, but ended up disappointed for the money we paid.
5
Went for lunch. Ordered Blackmore Ranch beef and Foie Gras set. Both items were excellently done. Indeed tasty. Service was prompt though restaurant was almost full.
Highly recommended!
4
The set lunches here are of exceptional value, much cheaper than that of the dinner. The Fat Cow donburi is my favorite. The wagyu slices are really good quality, and has a very strong smoky taste. Go for medium doneness, you will be blown away!
4
They have non meats on the menu but that's not what one goes for right?? Between us four, we had the American steak, Ohmi, the Butcher's Cut and the Saga. Even the "well done" Ohmi was oh so soft. The Butcher's Cut was explained to us to be the top part of the meat. Very fatty, tendons and all. I am afraid I still don't know what justifies the astronomical prices. I was told by the staff that this is because it is the 678th restaurant to get meat from a particular farm in Japan. Picture of the certificate is attached. Hmm. The meats do not come with sides. The sweet potato side was delicious. Desserts aren't great. The coffee granita was very strange (and quite large for one) but the black sesame ice cream yummy. Staff added a nice touch by serving a birthday dessert for the birthday boy. No high chairs at this restaurant.
5
The three of us came here for dinner. We were seated in one of the dining rooms, not the big communal teppanyaki-style table at the back which I find more interesting. We ordered food to share among us - start with few appetizers, then hamachi and tai sashimi, main courses are Japanese Wagyu ribeye and sirloin, sukiyaki beef, and the highlight was the truffled beef pot rice with onsen egg (yum...just typing this makes me salivates). There was also an extensive sake and wine menus. We ordered Dassai 50 sake to go with the Japanese style dishes. At the end of the night, we tried to vote the best dish and find it impossible to choose as all of them were so tasty at such high quality, though it comes at a cost of about SGD 300/head including drinks but it was well worth it
5
We had a family meal to celebrate my son's 18th birthday & we are glad we made the right choice.The Fat cow donburi is delicious! The wagyu beef was very nicely done, according to our preferences. The sashimi moriawase taste so good and fresh! Portions were all very decent. We had a pleasant surprise towards the end of the meal. Zharif (staff) brought out a "birthday cake" (mochi) for my son! My wife thought I arranged it, I thought she did. In fact, Zharif had noticed us joining in the singing of the birthday song (another group did so) and we were directing our singing towards our son. My son also ordered a glass of wine & Zharif concluded rightly we were celebrating his bday! Keep up the good job Zharif n thanks for the excellent service
3
Went on a much anticipated visit to Fat Cow. The location is a bit odd inside a medical clinic.The food is definitely good and really enjoyed the Wagyu tenderloin. Although was set off by the wine service, first I had to reject a glass because it was not properly polished then the struggle started to finish our bottle.......had to call for refills on 3 occasions. I expect with this level of restaurant to have attentive service. No excuses please because it was not busy at all
4
Went there to celebrate our anniversary since we've heard so much about it and lately I have been the mood for good wagyu beef. Nice place - was seated at the counter which unless you are having lots of sashimi, there isn't much to see since only sashimi appears to be prepared in front of the counter. The sashimi was good & fresh but pricey. Had the hot appetizer of the beef cubes which was very good and just raised my expectations of the main event - the grilled wagyu beef. Took 1 of the Japanese A4 ribeye ($125) as well as the slightly more reasonable Australian sirloin ($85). The beef was exquisite and there is a very appreciable difference in the 2 with the Japanese one being so unbelievably tender and robust tasting - guess you really have to pay for top quality. All in all, together with a pleasant dessert of black sesame and honeycomb icecream, a very good and enjoyable meal. Service was also very good. However, with all that coming at a tab of $400+ (with a small bottle of sake), sadly, will have to reserve this for special occasions only
3
All apart from the main course is fair I would say. Starters prices not cheap, but not outrageous, taste ok. Had A4 ribeye Ohmi and A5 shabu shabu for main. Tasted fine. The sauce of the ribeye of the steak was particularly good. This is surely not a cheap affair. The quality of the meat was good and the marbling of fat was there that lesser cow will not possess. Being used to eating non-wagyu meat in Europe I am not sure if I am convinced of differenced in value (in whatever units of currency per beef satisfaction)
4
Japanese Omakase. Great food, great atmosphere with fine decor.
Very spacious between patrons.
Food was expected from an establishment of this nature.
However, didn't really get the 'wow' factor for the price.
5
Visited the restaurant for dinner by myself. Found it easy to find a seat and staff were attentive and helpful. Meat was excellent and well cooked and flavours really made the meal.
5
They have special prices during lunch time and way cheaper than their regular prices.
Taste divine. I like the wagyu donburi and the spicy salmon don. Will definitely come back when I return to SG.
3
I heard a lot of raving reviews about Fat Cow. The location is a bit odd..at the ground floor of a medical center. The service was good , meaning very courteous and attentive. They did not seem super knowledgeable about the food though, but very nice and polite. The beef served on the Donburi was very average - that was supposed to be Wagyu from Japan, but it tasted quite ordinary. The rest of the meal was good,( very small portions of eggplants in miso for example) but again nothing to rave about. It will cost you 100 Sing Dollars for 100 grammes of beef if you go outside of the lunch boxes. I think that this is not great value
3
We have been hearing about the wonderful Japanese beef in Fat Cow and decided to try one evening. Restaurant ambiance is quite nice. Open kitchen and you can see the chefs preparing your food. Service was also very good. Unfortunately, I find the food too expensive for what it is, they are just average
1
Gave me a burst yoke Don buri. You really think people should pay 40 bucks for a burst yoke?? They shouldn't even be serving this. And they call themselves a high end restaurant. What if someone hated the yoke so bad? But its now mixed with all the rice? U gna pay 40 bucks for this kind of food? Is there no quality control? At all?
5
Very expensive but worth it. Nice for one time experience or special occasion.I ate the OX long cooking starter which if you like sweet food is amazing and the USA Wagyu steak which was so tasty.Didn't like the deserts I'm more of western desert person :
4
Two friends and myself had lunch at the Fat Cow. We took one Fat Cow Donburi which was charcoal grilled wagyu beef slices with onsen egg and shiro negi on rice 39/-++. and 2Fat Foa-Gura Don gazed foie gras with grilled wagyu beef cubes and rice 43/- ++.We started with salad, miso soup and chawanmushi which comes together with a lunch set. Dessert was a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The beef slices in th Donburi were disappointing as it was all lean with no marbling. Probably I should not expect too much for the lunch set. The rice with the perfectly done onsen egg was delicious. The beef cubes in the Foa-Gura don were more tasty. The foie gras was out of this world. All in all we had a good meal. Service was good. We would come back to try the pricier wagyu beef for dinner.
4
2 of us visited Fat Cow for lunch and we had the Wagyu Donburi with Onsen Egg ($39+++) and Wagyu Don with Foie Gras ($42+++)1) The Wagyu w egg looked stunning but it was difficult to tear the slices of beef into smaller bite sizes with chopsticks and a spoon. We gave the captain this feedback and he said: 'it's like this!' How can there be such sinews when we are paying top dollars for a Wagyu beef bowl?The rice, however, was very tasty, though a tad sweet. 2) The Wagyu don w foie gras had perfect cubes of both, which made a well portioned mouthful each time. Sadly the rice was a little bland. A pleasant visit overall :
4
Food was good if a bit expensive. We came away satisfied though.Reservation process could have been slicker though. I reserved an evening slot online via the restaurant website. I then received two confirmation emails with separate reservation times.When we reached the restaurant, we were told we would have to finish in less than 1 hour. Fortunately I was able to show staff the email confirmation which showed that the booking was for 2 hours. Staff moved us to another table to accommodate this, but it would have been better if this had all been worked out by staff before we arrived. I wasn't impressed about being told I had to eat a 3 course dinner in 50 minutes after we'd say down.After this though, food was good and service wasn't bad - though slightly below what I'd expected
5
Amazing standard for food - especially for beef, chawanmushi, salad dressing but service team can improve better for customer's drinks as hot drink topped-up wrongly (ordered green tea yuzu)
4
I found service to be awesome and the steak very nicely done to near perfection. Sides are to ones liking. I definitely liked the cold udon and would highly recommend it.
4
Many good restaurants now have 2 seatings which is annoying. Because they're so popular hence they want to cater to more customers (~ more revenue). Unfortunately, it also spoils customer's experience. These resto are generally not cheap. I would happily pay SGD 200 a head for lunch but we're still told to leave within 1hr 15min. Food at Fat Cow is very fresh and of such high quality, every single bite is a divine experience. Menu probably have 7 lunch set in total? We'd 3 of them and they're all very good. Cod Fish, Chirashi and Sashimi. I love the quality but not a place for chit-chatting and savor your food. I would be happy to come here alone
3
Saw many delightful and 'photogenic' grilled beef photos in claypot with pretty onsen egg (The dish is known as fat cow donburi) topped up with fantastic reviews as well, hence I decided to make an impromptu dinner visit. I am aware that the famous fat cow donburi is only available during lunch, and the dinner menu is quite different. I ordered the Donabemeshi (main) $78 and Wagyu Suji No Tare to Foa-Gura (side dish) $24. Both dishes are decent, for the main dish the beef cubes are tender and tasted a bit sweet (sweet taste is like beef jerky taste). What sets the taste apart is the sauce, otherwise, for the price, I will recommend you visit during lunch, whereby their lunch set is more value for money and the recommended dishes from most reviews are available during lunch.
4
this is not the place for a leisurely meal. there are 2 seatings at lunch & dinner, both around an hour and a half. so having lunch there the first time was a tad stressful for me. i'm not sure if my lunch companions felt likewise, it is not easy to eat and talk at the same time, amid the chattering of the other patrons who were celebrating a birthday at the next table. there are 2 tables per partitioned area. i'm one who enjoys a quiet leisure lunch, especially when catching up with friends, so this is definitely not the place. food selection and quality are great. the service staff made good recommendations and we enjoyed the food. Nora in particular is very attentive and friendly and gave us a little leeway in the time we had to vacate our table. overall good food and service
3
Service is excellent - knowledgeable and responsive, the ambiance is discrete-chic, so what about the food? It ranges from OK to very good, but in short: if you want a truly superior Japanese dining experience, pay up (yes, even more - it's outrageous!) and go to the Singapore grandees (Shinji, Ki-sho, Waku-Ghin, etc); if you are after great beef, in my opinion, the top western steakhouses deliver a more satisfying experience.For steak, just go for the Iwate Grade 5 ribeye. By comparison, the Grade 3 wagyu we had with the himi udon dish was very pedestrian! The bream with black truffle is also to be commended, reminds you of certain dishes at Nobu. Other dishes we had (himi udon, ox tendon and seared foie gras with daikon, desert, etc) were really nothing to write home about. So keep your fat wallet for other fat animals (duck, goose, hippo, lamb, cat, etc
4
Was here for dinner and tended to by the helpful staff. The ambience was lovely and relaxed, and we thoroughly enjoyed dinner with started with some otoro nigiri, crispy zucchini and barbecued eggplants. Didn't get wowed by the eggplants, will try something else next time. Our mains comprised of their Donabemeshi and Blackmore Ranch steak. The steak was good value for money, and we thoroughly enjoyed the don (although it reminded us very much of claypot rice as we approached the remnant bits of rice that we stuck to the bottom of the pot.All in all a good dining experience, to fully taste what Fat Cow can offer id advise diners to swing by for dinner rather than their lunch sets (which i had tried before but didnt inspire me to pen a review)
3
We went there for dinner. My husband had the US steak (Brandt beef) and I had the Wagyu over rice with Egg and special sauce (Donabemeshi). We also had 2 appetizers: KANI KOROKKE TO TSUKEMONO and WAGYU NO KAKUNI.The steak was good, as the husband said, and also the Wagyu no Kakuni. The other two dishes were just okay..Very very expensive for such a small portion of food. The ambiance and the sitting arrangement are quite unique. Maybe should go back to try out the Lunch menu instead.. :
1
Poor service, poor manager who has no idea about what is a gluten free diet. He brings in food with gluten, then takes them off and gives no replacement or even say sorry for his mistake. This should be a standard thing in this level restaurant
4
Had a family dinner at this restaurant located in the Medical Centre..!!Judging by the crowd - this is a popular place.We order mixture of beef ( 2 varieties : Wagyu and US ) , sashimi , salads , fat rice and stew beef tendons....Food is good & unique !
5
Though very pricey (148++ for a 150g cut), but the IWATE melts in the mouth. Be prepared to go with $$$ if you are not going for the Set Lunch/Dinner.
3
this place is much hyped for its high end beef
and true to form it was the high quality A5 beef that made the meal
apart from from the beef the rest of the food was only average
was not impressed by the service
5
I have been here twice. One for lunch and one for dinner.
The A5 beef is awesome. and the special soy sauce rice is so fragrant.
The black truffle bream is very refreshing starter. Love every bite of it.
Definitely come back here again.
4
Went there for the lunch and dinner, both were good but personally i preferred the lunch menu. Celebrated my birthday there and was touched by the chef's well wishes.
Will go back there definitely.
3
Shared here with my wife and friends recently after knowing them from some recommendations. I had the tuna don and my wife did the beef and foie gras donburi...hers is okay and mine were so so...value for the set with the money we pay?? hmmmm, so so...compare to down the road, along a stretch of shopping belt, a small entrance leading to a small japanese restaurant, that is far better...anyway, overall, okay experience and service were so so..
4
I would come back again and again and again for their Fat Foa-gura Don lunch set. A heavenly pairing of wonderfully seared foie gras and perfectly grilled wagyu beef. And Fat Cow does it right each time! I've had steak dinners there which were good as well but in my opinion abit pricey and to be reserved for those special occasions. What I'd recommend for dinner is their sliced bream with black truffle. A must-try for sashimi lovers. One order will probably not be enough. :
5
The lunch deal is an amazing deal for the budget-conscious. Perfectly Charcoal-grilled wagyu with a perfect onsen egg - mix it all in over Japanese rice and your meal is complete.The set also comes with chawanmushi (not the best I've had, but you are not here for this), a salad, miso soup, and ends with a daily dessert. The day that I was there, it was an amazing honeycomb ice-cream that still has pieces of honeycomb in it. Perfect for the recent hot weather. All these for under s$40.This is only a review for lunch and I can't wait to go for dinner, or another lunch, or another whatever at Fat Cow.Reservation is a must!
4
I was actually quite impressed by Fat Cow although I had read the reviews on tripadvisor. I think the meal was better than the average overall rating given. Three of us for dinner on a Saturday and shared the spinach salad, tofu and tuna, as well as fish carpaccio. For mains, we had two types of steak, sweet potato and fat rice. We tried three types of dessert. We brought our own wine (corkage was S$50 a bottle). The service was good. I agree that it was not a cheap meal (it depends on the type of meat you choose) but I've had a lot worse value for money
3
Had a business lunch here and ordered the lunch sets. They all sound quite good and range from $25-45. I took the "safe" Bara Chirashi. My other associates had the japanese curry and Foie Gras on sushi rice. My Bara was ok, nothing outstanding. It came with chawunmushi, miso soup and salad, which were ok. The japanese curry was a lot darker in colour than most i've seen, but my friend seemed to like it. No complaints from the foie gras meal either, though it's a little rich for me. Overall an ok place, perhaps dinner would be the time to be impressed, or disppointe
5
This is really great steak.We had Wagyu A4and5 Ribeye which was full of flavor and meltingly tender.The waiter was exceptionally helpful and overall a wonderful experience ending with a palate-cleansing Yuzu sorbet.Yes it is expensive but it is of the highest quality.Personally I prefer the quality here to the quantity of Morton's or The Cut.A curious location at the bottom of the Campden Medical Centre but a good ambience inside.One of the best places to eat for grown-ups in Singapore
4
I like their salad, sashimi and very tasty beef. The price is a bid expensive like other Japanese restaurant, but I will come again.
3
We had dinner at Fat Cow. The beef is good but not fanstastic and i think it is expensive. Service is good.
3
We had a dinner on fat cow. The ambience was good at the grill bar, nice interior.. Service was OK.. However, we feel that the food and drinks was not that great.. We ordered the butcher collection which said to be their best beef, but the beef quality isn't there.. It was a bit rough, worse than wagyu marbling 6, but with the price of Kobe.. And the ranger valley beef was even worse.. But, they have a good spices and fat rice, despite the overstated beef quality...Overall, OK, but overpriced.
4
We had dinner at Fat Cow to celebrate our anniversary. The restaurant is decorated very nicely but it was a little noisy in the dining area that we were seated at. The table sitting beside us were quite rowdy and the Japanese paper room divider between didn't do much to muffle the sound. It wasn't exactly the 'romantic' ambience that I was hoping for. Having said that, the food certainly impressed us and once the dishes came out, we soon forgot about the noisy table beside us. Highlights for us were the 'slow-cooked ox tendon and seared foie gras with daikon' and 'rice porridge with egg in a mushroom-beef broth'. To end the night, the chef prepared a complimentary dessert platter for our anniversary which I thought was very thoughtful of them
3
Came here with friends and had The Macallan Whiskey Dinner set menu. The whiskey pairing was rather thoughtless. The first course, the Maguro to Ringo no Kunsei Shio (chopped tuna, Fuji apples, sushi rice, salmon roe and smoked salt) was very average. The second course, the Wagyu Sumibiyaki no Kuro Nin'Niku (100% pure-blood Blackmore ranch wagyu beef) was quite good. The Himi Udon no Omo-San (handmade noodles with crispy fried beef) was below par. The beef was extremely dry and rough. Finally the Yuzu-Miso-Gyunya (yuzu sorbet with white miso biscuit and milk pudding) didn't work very well together and was not very delicate for Japanese dessert. In all, our expectation of the restaurant far exceeded what the establishment was actually able to deliver.
5
I have enjoyed several meals at this lovely restaurant the food is delightfully presented and some of the best Japanese I have had in Singapore, We had the spinach salad, which is really delicious, sashimi and crab cakes, They serve set lunches and have an a la carte menu. I think it would be a lovely setting for dinner, which I look forward to trying soo
3
Fat Cow has been reviewed to death and half the people I talk to praise it sky high, the other half told me to forget it, so i decided to check it out myself one Saturday afternoon. Turned out to be somewhat of a teenybopper type of a place (lots of young lady customers) with very adult prices. Definitely a place for the easily impressed. Youngish local chefs with zero customer-relations skills churning out very unoriginal seabream with truffles, mediocire chawanmushi, and wagyu beef and foie gras on rice served by Filipinos. If that rocks your boat, be my guest. They could do with less theatrics. I was told that the earliest "slot" was 1.45pm and at 10.30pm the night before I received a call reminding me of my reservation. Ah, probably easier to get an audience with the Pope
2
This restaurant is the only one in the Camden Medical Centre. it might seem like a strange location until you realise that the service here could send you looking for medical help for high blood pressure. The restaurant prides itself on its beef. The beef was good but nowhere near as good as the prices suggest. Countless staff looked after us. All working to their own time table not ours and only one of whom was able to explain the menu at all. There is not time to explain all the mis-steps that spoiled our evening. Instead, please consider the countless other Japanese restaurants in Singapore before this one. Unless, of course, stress is what you are after.

For more reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatThere have been mixed reviews on the restaurant and one thing I heard was that the food doesn't justify the price. However, with the downward revision of the already affordable lunch sets, I don't think anyone would be deterred from checking FC out. Each set comes with salad, chawanmushi, miso soup and dessert with your choice of mains. Pick from the 12 mains which are priced from $25 to $48. Don't worry if you're not a beef fan, there are sashimi, pork and chicken on the menu too.The chawanmushi was topped with a light tasting crab sauce and it has prawn, mushroom and scallop in it.We ordered the Kinoko ($14), assorted Japanese mushrooms braised with sake, lime and butter. Honestly, it tasted like normal stir fry with a tinge of lime. A disappointment really. And it was a rather small portion.We also tried the Nasu Dengaku ($10), barbecued eggplant glazed with honey miso. This is a tiny baby Japanese eggplant and it certainly isn't worth the price tag. There was a plum undertone in the salty miso which didn't sit well with the girls.We had the 2 hot favorites at Fat Cow, which is the Fat Foa-Gura Don ($42) and The Fat Cow Donburi ($38). It was a tussle between the 2 choices but here's the flavor profiles so that you can decide for yourself! The Fat Foa-Gura Don has the rich and buttery glazed foie gras chunks and grilled wagyu beef cubes. The sauce was a little on the sweet side but the overall flavor is strong and heavy. I liked the toppings on this one but i found the rice to be a little on the dry side and it acted like a sponge, soaking up all the oil from the goose liver..The Fat Cow Donburi is a simpler dish in comparison but it has its own merits. Charcoal grilled Wagyu Beef with a light garlic flavor, with onsen egg and shiro negi. The first thing we noticed about the dish was its truffle aroma.Break the egg and mix everything together and enjoy the moist and flavorful rice. Absolutely delicious
4
Fat cow is indeed famous for its beef, undoubtedly delicious! You need to make reservation or else you have a very little chance for being served. I had the must-try foie gras beef rice & the whole thing melt beautifully in my mouth. Also had the white fish truffle, that meal was also one of the nice experience. The one thing I dislike was only the price, I went broke once I got out of the restaurant
