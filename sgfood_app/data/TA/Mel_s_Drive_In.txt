The burgers was very tasty and the prices also was good... the staff was very helpful and polite....

This place was fun, an uber American diner. I was waiting for Susan Sarandon from Kingsmen to serve me.. Recommended.
1
They offer a variety of overpriced meals that don’t even taste good! The bun is black ( idk why) and the bacon on the burger is terrible! If I pay 16 dollars for a burger, I’d expect more. Do not recommend it to anyone
4
Came here for lunch whilst we were at Universal and it was unreal. I had a burger, choc milkshake, chips and coleslaw for a very affordable fifteen dollars. It definitely has the American vibe and feels as if you've stepped back in time

A day to this tourist trap park called 'Universal Studios' will leave you thirsty and hungry for something casual, something cool, something tasty and something memorable. Mel's Drive In is not it. It's crowded, has a food-court-like feel about it with uninterested staff half-heartedly swiping the tables with a dirty rag in an attempt to clean them. The food was mediocre and the burger we had looked good, but the patty comprised more bread than meat. The battered onion rings were oily and the drinks were no different to that of any fast-food outlet around town, only more expensive
3
Located inside Universal Studio Singapore. Price is not cheap. One burger costs about $14. Nothing spectacular about the burger.. taste average.
4
Love the interior of this eatery, comfortable seats with a lovely view of the park.I ordered a cheese burger, with onion rings and coke for sharing. The burger was a good size, more than enough for one person. The onion rings were not crispy at all, but were fragrant. (Smells better than it tastes) The (large) coca cola drink was more than enough to share between two people. Service was quick as we were there for lunch on a weekday, just before noon. The only downside is how expensive the prices are, but that is to be expected since this is a tourist attraction. We were hoping that the drink was refillable, but as with other fast food places in Singapore, they did not offer that

Let's face it: you're not going to get the greatest food at a theme park. Quality ranges from decent to poor...and some parks are worse than others. Disney, Knobel's and Busch Gardens/SeaWorld tend to the on the higher scale (okay food), where as Six Flags, Cedar Fair and Universal (depending on where you eat) tend to be on the lower end.Mel's Drive-In at Universal Studios Singapore is one of the worst places I've eaten at any Universal theme park. The prices were high, the service was poor, portion sizes were on the smaller side (compared to what you would get at an American park), free refills were not offered, and the buns they served their burgers on were black. They advertise their buns as being something along the lines of "smokey" or "charcoal," but they tasted like chemical. The burgers were bland with an odd consistency, the fries were soggy, and the milkshakes were too sweet. My fiancee (a Filipina who LOVES a yummy western burger) was also very disappointed. We ended up throwing half of our orders away...and getting sick that evening once we were back in our hotel room after Halloween Horror Nights.You will find much better dining options with better values just outside the front gate of Universal Studios in The Forum. Skip Mel's and go somewhere better...this is NOT "like being in a traditional American diner.

I was in Universal Studios Singapore on Friday night for a company event and had the chance to try two of the restaurants that opened that night.Mel's Drive In was my first restaurant for the evening and it was just as I expected.The decor of Mel's is fashioned after a traditional American diner with decorative jukeboxes and sofa benches all over. Food wise was just as what we expected, burgers and fast food.We thought the cheeseburger we ordered was a little dry and onion rings a tad soggy. Fair to point out that they probably were expecting a bigger turnout and had to pre-prepare quite a few servings before that but then..Saving grace was the milkshake which was nice but ran out when we tried to return for a second serving @ close to 9+pm that night.Still a decent place if you like burgers and fries though..Remember to take a photo of the Americian Graffiti yellow cab outside.
4
It has a nice retro feel once you're inside. You'll love the decor in this place! The burger (Bacon Cheeseburger) is a bit dry and sad
3
one of the sit of restaurants at restaurants at USS, this place serves decent diner style food (burgers, nuggets, onion rings) and decent milk shakes. you can eat both inside or outside. it is located just down the main drive as you enter the park.
5
One of the best burgers I ate.
Meal has been accompanied with fries and coleslaw but not soft drink.
Soft drink was extra.
Anyhow, my recommendation is that you should visit.
5
The beef burger was one of the best seller. It is come with crunchy bacon and you could feel the juices part.
4
Dropped in here for a quick lunch and an opportunity to sit down out of the midday heat. Burgers were awesome ...tasty hot and delivered quickly. The restaurant was cool clean and comfortable
5
I got $5 meal voucher from buying the USS ticket and i decided to have a meal here!
The burger doesn't disappoint us! It was very nice burger.
4
The diner looks great, inside and out. Our burgers were very good and better than I'd expect to get at a theme park. Overall the facilities were first class. although expect a little mania if you go at peak lunch time. Recommend for lunchtime at Universal Studios
3
Review by Dr Sim. Burgers are expensive. Food is average. Service is average. Good environment. Looks like the time of the "Fonz" Happy Days. Regards Dr Si
5
Very nice prices for Singapore, tasty burgers and good portion. It worths to visit it there because some other restaurands in Universal Studios are much expensive
3
My children did not like the black burger buns. Burgers and fries tastes just like your burgers and fries from the groceries
1
Have eaten there many times before and was always ok however something has changed. Black burger buns, horrible patty and what looked like lab grown objects for bacon. I'll steer clear of this place in future.
3
Everything you expect from an American Diner. Acceptable food, nice shows outside, but pricey, it's in USS, can't expect cheap stuff here.
5
My favourite place to eat when I come to Universal Studios. This restaurant serves great American meals and there will be singing performances outside so while you eat, you can enjoy the songs being sung. Highly recommended.
3
Typical American theme restaurant serving burgers, fries and beverages. Only 1 vegetarian burger. Fries are worthwhile. Overall average experience.
3
Fun atmosphere but small menu. Plenty of seating and clean. Food was ok, nothing to upset anyone but certainly not 5 star.
2
Went as was in Universal Studios but the food was expensive and very average at best.The queues were huge and the food wasnt exactly hot when you got it.Probably the dirtiest place we were in whilst in Singapore.Wouldn't recommen
4
Admittedly this is not a Mel's Diner as in California nor the Drive In close to West Hollywood. It is more of a fast food restaurant with the feel of the diner including awesome period cars from American Graffiti surrounding it. There's even a daily show in the front on a jukebox.Food is hamburgers, chicken fingers, fried chicken hamburgers, fries, onion rings and milkshakes.Good break from Asian food for a little while.Careful with the spicy ketchup if that's not your thing
2
Great friendly, quick service at this nicely decorated restaurant. The burgers came out like hockey pucks and were extremely overcooked. The milkshake was very difficult to drink as it was extremely thick and could not drink via a straw. Could not locate a spoon to eat the shake that way either. Extremely disappointed with the meal and think there are other restaurants to eat @ Universal that would be much, much better. Would absolutely not eat here again
3
Typical fast food restaurant with nicer decor and more comfy seats. $14-15 a set meal consisting of a burger, fries and soda. It was kinda hot and stuffy inside tho, they need to up the air conditioning, we sat outside as it was not so stuffy. Staff were nice and friendly :)Here's a picture of the cheese fries, very generous serving of cheese!
3
Probably one of the better places to grab a quick bite and rest while visiting Universal Studios. Typical American Diner/Fast Food. If you don't really want to exert too much effort in thinking about and choosing what to eat - then this is the place to go
4
Nice place to cool down after the rides. Food is mainly your typical burgers & fries. nothing to shout about. At least in here the staff are friendly & cheerful and the service is fast
3
This restaurant captures the feel of an American diner, albeit in a fairly antiseptic way. The food is basic theme park burgers, fries and shakes at high theme park prices. The ice cream cones were small, but quite tasty.
4
This restaurant located in The Universal Studios Singapore. If you ever visit USS please don't forget to eat here and order DOUBLE DOUBLE ! Sooo goooood ! And also this restaurant is a Halal restaurant!
4
I wanted to try that cheese french fries as i read a review it is good. But actually that was not exceptional, it was ok..
I tried lime juice too. Both are ok for the price.
4
After nearly six hours wandering around USS Mel's beckoned for a cool drink and a soft serve chocolate sundae.....just what I wanted after my adventures.
The décor definitively feels like a roadside diner from the 1950's.
4
Nice atmosphere. Good burgers at a reasonable price considering it was Universal Studios. We were served very quickly and got a seat. But we ate earlier than most on a quiet day.
4
Yup. This is it if you want surreal dining. Nice deco and theme park feel. But the burgers are far from worth-trying. The meat in-between the patty is flat and stale. You won't die eating it, but you won't find a lot of pleasure also, since most of the taste comes from the tomato sauce and whatever cheesy sticky cream they chuck in-between. Apart from the experience, the dining was a let down
3
Nice cheesy fries. Great for food after playing of rides in the theme park. However, beware, a meal consisting of fries, burger and soft drink is $16, which is the average price for fast food in theme park. Go there if you want to try food different from what is outside of the theme park
5
I specially like the Cheesy Fries...I wish If i find the same in my home country - Sri Lanka. If i can meet the Chairman of Mel's Drive in I would ask him to franchise in Sri Lanka with the same quality and service. I really liked the food....being a cheesy food lover...I would recommend this place to anyon
3
Fast food burgers as good as you might expect at any amusement park. Enjoyed a Double Cheeseburger, Fries, Chocolate Milk Shake. Tasted and smelled much better than the Indian dining venue.Nicely decorated and authentic for an early 1950's diner.
4
o Beautiful and classic fast food restaurant. o S$15 for double beef, good bargain for a mediocre quality burger. o Typical fast food. o Nice music and amazing retro automobiles outside the restaurant. Takes you back to the old Hollywood (that's the whole point!).o Bumped into Mel's Diner Girl singing at 1445 that day. Gorgeous and adorable. o Far far away castle is visible from the restaurant. It's a kinda magic.o Heinz chilli and ketchup. x Small portion of fries. But decent quality.
5
Mel's Drive In is a fast food chain. Since we're in a hurry to eat so we won't miss out the rides, we prefer not to wait. The choices of food is just like with other known fast-food chains.
3
Pricey and average food as expected due to its location inside USS. Menu of your typical fast food chain of burgers, fries, milkshakes and soft drinks. Definitely tasted better food but at least keep the kid happy and going.
4
I had the chili & cheese burger which was good.
The fries were great as it doesn't seem that it was frozen.
5
Awesome Hamburger with great fries. Lunch was great after a long day of walking around Universal Studios in the hot sun. The milk shake took me back to California
3
We come to the restaurant since our last visit to the USS 3 years ago. The food there is quite okay. The decoration there is nice and the furniture there is looking great.There is a kid menu, which is quite suitable for toddlers and up.One negative thing that I could think of during this visit is that the 2 entrance door are widely opened which leads to the loss of cool air even though the air con is on. The restaurant is not cool at all. We tried to close the door at the entrance, one of the doors are malfunctioned, which could not be closed. Hope that it will be better next time when we visit again. The burger there is really big, I need to share mine with my hubby in order to finish it
4
One of the better eateries within USS even though their prices are high. For example, had the $15 dbl patty beef burger. It was huge and quite filling but had to think twice about the price. Nevertheless, didn't have a choice because the other places would've been more expensive or equally high priced. For cheaper options, try eating outside of USS at Malaysia Street Food or Astons. They are just outside the entrance of USS
1
It was suppose to come with 2 sauces on the hotdog, dijon mustard and another sauce (forgot the name) and fries. I paid $18 for a 16" bun with the hotdog and fries. No sauce. I thought it was a mistake made by the kitchen, they probably forgot the sauce. Went to the counter to ask about it and they told me they were out of both of the sauces. So why wasn't I informed beforehand that they ran out of sauces? I could have bought another meal instead?P/S: The hotdog was a major turnoff, bland to be exact. Not even slight taste of hotdog, it tasted like... it's been soaked in water for so long... so long, it took on the taste of plain water. Was told by the manager that the hotdog "it's suppose to taste like that". Manager didn't even apologize for not informing for the 2 sauces that they ran out of. Don't get how they know their hotdog is so bland and they can continue selling by telling people "it's suppose to taste like that". For godness sake, change a hotdog supplier? Or a different kind of hotdog?
4
Whenever we visit USS, we feel quite compelled to eat here. Their burgers are good and I love the chili fries. It's bright and airy, and you get a nice view of the park, unlike most of the other restaurants there. If your timing is right, you can watch the Mel's Dinettes or the Cruisers perform on the jukebox stage, or Beetlejuice comes around to mess with you.The deco is retro diner style, pity the jukeboxes at the booths don't work. Tray return points would be appreciated!Try the Legend, a GIANT burger or the extra long meatball sub. They have seasonal offerings on and off, like a 'bloody red' burger for Halloween (they changed their name to Mel's Die-In). At the end of the day, it's still theme park food, but it's HALAL theme park food and it fills you right up. Invites members (it comes with the annual pass) get 20% rebates on food and purchases around the park so it doesn't feel so expensive
4
I visited USS with my colleagues as a company bonding trip. We took 3 compulsory rides and had time for 1 more before we ate our lunch and took the company chartered bus back.We were given lunch vouchers of $15 and the most convenient and fastest (in our opinion) was Mel's Drive In. The set meals displayed on the board are about $14. Most of us upgraded to cheese fries for a total $15. The beef burger was fantastic and the cheese (for the fries) was generous.Some of our colleagues had their meals at other restaurants and commented that theirs were more worth it
3
Nice place to stop by to recharge and fill up the stomach. Perhaps slightly pricey for a fast food place but it is located right in the middle of USS. Parents with kids and seniors would definitely welcome the convenience. The burgers were great and the fries were not that bad as well. Wouldn't mind patronizing this place again when i visit USS in future. The ordering was fast and food was served fast as well. That will leave you more time to enjoy the rest of USS
4
A good airconditioned, (and popular) stop for lunch or dinner, with a really good feel as a 50's diner. Great value
4
I love their restaurant atmosphere with their typical American diner. I'm enjoyed eating here and I loved their cheese burger. Staff is friendly and helpful. And the best things is that this is one of Halal Restaurant in USS.
3
Big burger, can say it price is acceptble, got softdrink, french fries, and double.double burger just 15sgd
3
With classic cars parked outside and an American diner theme it had the making of a nice place to hang out for a while as we cooled down from the rides. Unfortunately the portions were poor and prices did not match. We prefer the Starbucks for a coffee and a sandwich.
3
We decided to stop at Mels, why, because almost every movie made in that time had a Mels diner.It was like most fast food places where you lined up.The inside with the lam index tables etc looked great.We got bugers, fries and a drink.The buger was very ordinary indeed, just a pattie, 2 bits of pickle and some lettuce.Not what I would call a burger for $11 plus.Fries were good , my wife had an iced tea and could not drink it as way too much suga
5
This was a great place to have lunch. Nice burgers with fries and yummy milkshakes. Great atmosphere and fun casual environment. I can definitely recommend this as a Western option.
4
Inside UNiversal studios, mel's drive in is a burger & fries joint with express service.It is not a value for money place but so is the case with most other restaurants in Sentosa Island....After a tiring trip, your kids might love the burger break...
3
Though we always know that theme park restaurants and cafe's are meant to sizzle your wallet to death - they make it a point to not allow outside food so you have no option. If you have to eat, you have to. Guess there's not much to review here except quality average, prices high. But didn't you know that already
3
We went here yesterday. Ordered two vegetarian burgers, with fries and a huge soda. They cost $14 each- not surprised that the prices are silly in a place like this.I'm sure working here isn't the best job in the world, but please, ask the staff to smile. The old, small woman working here was the most miserable looking person I have seen in the whole of Singapore. If you're working at a theme park, for goodness sake at least pretend to be happy.The burgers took absolutely ages to make. They were also a little strange. Just a deep fried patty full of green, mushy vegetables. Why don't you just put onion rings and cheese in a burger for the veggies? Wouldn't take years to make like this one does! At least the woman apologised for the wait.Also, we've all paid more than enough to be here, make the damn juke box free!Cool looking place inside, typical American diner. The other burgers looked good. The black bun one looked so cool! Can't say we would come back. Service with a smile never goes unnoticed
3
We like Mel's Diner and always visit when in U S, as there is usually a good fun atmosphere with the music and friendly staff, but this was defiantly lacking on this occasion. Food average, restaurant untidy, staff seemed not to be interested in providing any customer service.
5
One of the restaurants in Universal Studios Singapore.
It could get pretty crowded but i love the decor and ambiance of this place. Burgers were pretty decent too!
3
Good decor and basic grub for the young teens but don't bother otherwise, it's the wrong food for the heat and humidity of Sentosa. And why would you travel to Singapore for greasy fries?
3
Mel's Drive-In is a fast food restaurant in Universal Studios Singapore. Food is halal and good. The service is fast and the decor is also good. It's suitable for all ages.
4
this was in universal studios, not stop playing 50's & 60's music, which we love, food nice, nice atmosphere as well, would defo recommend!
5
The food was good, the service was fantastic, and the music outside was excellent. Be sure to go when they are singing and dancing outside the restaurant.
1
The venue has been set up as a classic fifties US diner, complete with vintage cars and even a rock and roll band playing when we were there. Inside the furniture and ambiance was great. Unfortunately the food was absolutely appalling, with burgers that dissolved and for a typically inflated resort price. Service at the counter was slow and I'd have hated to see it on a really busy day
2
We stoped in here on the 25/5/2015 and also thought very little of the price and food.It was @ 3:45 in the arvo and we felt hungry and wanted to stay inside Universal till the lights came on for more photos so we went to Mel's Drive in.We got 2 cheese burger combo's. The price for this was $25.90.The same sort of order at McDonalds is about $15 to $16 and always hot.The price only annoyed me because the food was terrible.The chips and burgers were cold and had No flavour.Even the cups of Cola was just all ice and very little Cola
1
This place caters to a captive audience within the Universal Studios entertainment complex. The food is pretty bad and quite overpriced given the quality. We had 3 very substandard burgers for about $40. You're much better off to eat outside the complex if you have a season pass
4
We had lunch at Mel's Drive In Diner at Universal Studios on Sentosa Island. It was a fun experience for the kids. The decor is authentic and the food is typical american diner food. Although the diner was very busy, the service was efficient and friendly. The food was fresh and tasty and the entertainment was an added bonus. It was an expensive lunch, but worth the visit
1
This was by far the worst burger I have ever had. It was sitting in the warmer so when I got it it was cold, soggy and horrible. After returning home I read some other reviews about universal studios and saw that a lot of people had mentioned the same thing but not on here specifically. Give this place a miss if you ca
3
Like the old-school feel of the restaurant, hence decided to try out this restaurant. A set of burger, fries and a soft drink cost SGD11! Worst, burgers and fries were not even warm!
3
French Fries only to eat. Even the Veg burger has egg white in bread...Watch out But yes you have options to drink.
4
Halal certiifed, would you believe.. Usual array of burgers and shakes. Great to run off a few pictures, and watch people come and go.
5
Me and my boyfriend had lunch here. Food was really nice and liked the design of the restaurant :) would eat here again if I was in Singapore
3
We have eaten at Mel's in LA, Orlando and now Singapore. Great 60's concept space complete with the caddies and chivies parked out the front. Average food and expensive as is expected inside a theme park. This place was spotlessly clean and service was good.
4
We had ordered burgers.they are served with fries.the portions are good.the seating arrangements are very nice.
5
It's modelled exactly like the one in Universal Orlando. I don't eat fatty foods but had to give it a go. I loved the milkshake and fries. Would recommend just for the atmosphere and american diner experience.Burgers are bit expensive though, so take it into considering when you order for a big party
4
I always visit Mel's drive-in whenever I go to USS, this has become like one of the theme park attraction for me. We like the ambience and the atmosphere a lot, perfectly blending with the classic hollywood theme.This is a Halal certified restaurant with nice variety of hotdogs and burgers. A must visit !Cheers 
4
While visiting universal studios, you will need lot of food to keep up your energy level high to run around the park for the whole day.... we opted for Mel's Drive-In for lunch and it was the best choice... the food options were good and even food was tasty... do give it a try if you are fan of fastfood with good health quotient
4
This is inside Universal Studios and you will pay typical park prices for food. They have a really good chili cheese burger but I didn't like the chili dog too much. I also got the cheese fries and they do not hold back on the cheese so that was good. The coke float was tasty as well. All in all a good experience and the dining room is air conditioned which is a plus
3
had the chilli burger, chips and drink. was ok but nothing to write home about. Hard to get a seat for the family during lunch time.
Would eat here again but wouldn't line up for it.
3
Their counters, mostly old CHINESE ladies, are some kinda rude.
Nothing fancy... Food not good but not too bad after all...
4
wow the kids had fun with the show outside while having lunch
price is very good
very nice food
would recommend this place to everyone one must place to see
4
A great american diner, we got free lunch boxes for the kids. The show outside was cool! Even the stage outside is a nice place to take a picture, like you are the performing on stage.
3
It's halal and located near the entrance with big seating space inside and outside the restaurant. Price wise, reasonable.
4
If you like those thick creamy yet refreshing milkshakes, get one from Mel's Drive In. I also love their burgers, but then, was too full to have one this time around.
4
Food was good, nothing extraordinary. But the 60's set up made it an exciting place to have a meal. The trio singing just outside the diner was a bonus. Great entertainment. Service was fast despite the long queues
5
The Dance show is amazing, food is good and you get transported to America of 60's or '70's (one which I've seen only in movies)
3
Mel needs a good shake, rattle and roll to get that diner into top gear. Slow service, not enough seating, highly overpriced food; there was no organisation anywhere ,untidy place, No happy days here !
2
The atmosphere is great. It looks the part, but I wonder what Mel would think of this Singapore franchise. I am sure that the burgers in the original Mel's are made fresh and are juicy, real burgers. The ones here are rubbish. They are no better than those at McDonalds. Awful hockey pucks in a cheap bun. The fries were OK, but not special at all. I would not eat here again and we kind of regretted being pulled in by the image. We wanted it to be good, but unfortunately it was not
3
Prices are reasonable and servings are big. But orders arrive too slow, took them more than 30 minutes to bring our burgers and fries.
5
My Daughter's name is Mel so we definitely had to go there we had milk shakes and spiders and then they had singers outside it was just fantastic just like the soda shops used to be, Need more of them. Good fun.
5
We ate here when at universal studios. The food was lovely, great selection, tasty & the cost was reasonable. The restaurant was clean and the service excellent.
3
Typical for a theme park. Not bad food, but the value is average.
But what do you expect at a theme park?
4
Loved the burgers, milkshakes.Time they fixed some of the seats in the booths as the seats were torn. They ran out of some fountain drinks. And considering it was a weekday and not a Singapore school holiday, that was pretty shocking.
3
Very retro place, choices of burgers and hotdogs. Not too expensive for USS. Average S$12 per burger set with drinks.
4
My friend and I were starving, and decided to give it a go, and we're so glad that we did! The burgers and shakes were delicious, as were the cheesy fries! Best, though was probably the 50's boy band performing right outside the diner...we just had to go and sing along! Food is halal, as is most of the food inside the Universal Studios
3
This is a good replica of a 50's type diner and that is where it ends, the burgers are overpriced for what they give you and the milkshakes were tasteless. The vintage American cars out front are not maintained and are showing their age. The restaurant was clean and the music was great as well as the counter service. If they want want to replicate this time period then get some quality assurance people into looking at the food
5
Good:-Where in Singapore (but here) can you get to see waitresses dressed in all-American-uniforms? But the uniforms fit well into the "Rock & Roll" atmosphere of the diner.-Burgers are a good portion, but after all that walking( in the park), 1 serving may not be enough for you.-Grab a seat@ the window & you might have a front-row-seat to watch the Mel Dinnettes perform their dance routine!Bad:
4
We were just so delighted to get a freshly prepared Vegetarian Burger after our tiring walk around Universal studios, this is just close to the Steven Spielberg Special Effects attration. Ample space, well lighted and smiling staff, it's the right place to rest your legs & get a nice burger, french fries & sip on some ice tea. Recommended for vegetarians, like u
