Had the set lunch grilled saba. That was good. Not too dry and meat was juicy. Staff was friendly too.

We had brunch at the restaurant and service was quite fast. The food quality was above average though nothing left an impression. It's a nice place to go for a quick lunch especially with kids in tow.

Staff are friendly and provided great service. Salad was bitter and was not charged. Impressed. Love the teriyaki beef don. Second visit will go bk again.

Ordered Katsudon through Deliveroo. It was the worst Katsudon I have eaten. The meat was dry and I can hardly see any egg over the meat

As usual Josephine makes good recommendation. The lunch that I had is very nicely presented and the food quality is very good.

Even though we booked a table for four, through CHOPE, when we entered the restauarant, the restaurant manager did not seem to acknowledge it. We had requested for a small cake to celebrate our sonâ€™s 21st birthday, which was also ignored. Even though we spent around $150 for lunch, we did not get the satisafaction of eating in a good Japanese restaurant. Average fare

I wish to thank Assist. Manager Stephy for her good attitude and good service. I did not order her recommendations but when I picked my choice instead of discouraging me she told me that my choice is also very popular with other guests. She also gave me positive feedback of the food. This makes me enjoy my food and look forward to visit Hoshigaoka Turf City again.

Was shopping for cars at the turf club and was looking for a place to have dinner after that. Chance upon this Japanese restaurant right beside the car park and decided to give it a try.Japanese settings within the restaurant were very inviting. The servers got us seated in no time. We ordered the simple donburi, gyu don and Katsu don. They were above average
