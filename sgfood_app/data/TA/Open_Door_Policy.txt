Love the ambience of this restaurant! The plants and the herbs make the restaurant feel very different. The food is really taste albeit pricy.
5
Cosy setting, helpful and friendly staff. Very good food with vegetarian and vegan options was a big plus!
5
We had the roast pork and crab meat pasta and both tasted really fresh and delicious! I really like the sweet potato mash that came with the pork... the pork was tender and wasn't dry. I'll definitely be back.
5
We had such a nice n sumptuous Valentine's dinner. We love the food though this is the first time we visited this restaurant but we will surely come back. The food was prepared with great attention to satisfy the taste. Our taste buds are extremely happy... from the smooth wine, to the unique starter, the terrific main course all the way to delicious dessert... we are extremely satisfied. The taste n quality of food is appreciably great! And finally, the warmth of their staff n thoughtful service made our evening complete. To Raissa n staff, thank you all!

Dishes were small and not particularly tasty. Food presentation was great. Place has a good vibe, decoration is very good. However, the dishes were considerably pricy and not particularly good taste or nice amount (given the price). Would consider coming back for a late drink/juice, but we were disappointed dinner wise
5
We came to ODP specifically because it is 100% gluten free to cater for a coeliac. This meant no chance of cross contamination which is a major problem for us when dining out. We throughly enjoyed our meal of the osso bucco rissotto (meat was so tender), spicy pork ribs and fried potato bread. Was absolutely delicious! We finished off with the kiwi cashew nut milk custard which was super creamy despite being dairy free and a dairy free cheesecake plus a coffee (my partner raved about how good the coffee was). We dined for lunch and turned up without a reservation but we were told it is much more busy for dinner. Staff were attentive and helpful and the food came quite quickly as it was not busy. It is quite pricey but this was a special occasion and we are happy to pay to not be glutened! Would visit again next time we are visiting and highly recommend for sensitive coeliacs

Overpriced for pretty average dishes. Very small portions. We only had a main because of the prices and left hungry still. The 'grow your own food' concept was restricted to a lot of one type of herb growing along the walls. Many better options in Singapore
3
Unfortunately food was no where near what we expected for the hype. Veg risotto was prob below average amongst all risottos despite the price. Signature souffle was average. Wont be coming bac
5
Tucked in the corner of Tiong Bahru is a gem of a restaurant that not only serves yummy gluten and dairy free food but grows their own herbs and vegetable. Fresh healthy and yet delicious. Service was warm and friendly and food portions were just right
4
Nice xmas eve dinner here. The menu was a bit different from before. Everything here is gluten free and dairy free. The desserts in the past taste better though.The server didnt see me passing my credit card to another server and thought i was walking away without paying. Thats an amusing part of the dinner
3
Portions were small. Some of the food were delicious. Particularly the salads. The mains are okay. No cakes
5
ODP has never disappointed us each time we return. This is the 5th time we have visited and still the food remains great and service excellent!
5
All food is gluten free and diary free - paradise for us. They even have gluten free beer - 2 options (Vagabond and Estrella). We chose the lunch menu set - it was delicious! Thank you ODP!!
3
Very nice ambiance, away from the busy hangout places. Food was a nice combination of Western and SE Asian cuisines.
5
Service was good, food served promptly. A very homely and comfortably place to visit! Sous vide salmon was cooked to perfection :)
5
The location is situated in the middle of the bustling Tiong Bahru district. Yet inside its peaceful and quiet. The service is great and food is pretty well crafted. Thumbs up~
4
The place was really pretty! With plants on the walls and the overall feel of the place is 100%. Food was ok, a bit on the pricey side.
5
After following the restaurant for a while on Instagram, I finally found time to make it there on a weekday for lunch. The restaurant was cosy and the service friendly. The menu, while compact, had enough variety to make it interesting. The food was delicious and quite inventive (though I wouldn't have minded a larger portion!). Will have to return!
5
It way past 9 pm, in search for a late dinner, when I walked past this restaurant with a Michelin sticker on the shop front, . There were only 3 other occupied tables, all occupied by Caucasians, when I walked in. Service was prompt and I ordered the Roast Pork Rack without knowing that it was the starred dish of the restaurant. At the end of my meal, the waitress told me that it was last available serving. How lucky I was to not have missed this wonderful dish. The pork was tender, the gravy delectable and the beetroot superbly cooked. Overall, this dish scored high in terms of presentation, texture and taste and is one of the best dishes I have tried. The décor of the restaurant is charming too with rows of fresh herbs on the wall. Will definitely revisit again to try out the other offerings of this restaurant

Think again ....seek out this little local place near Tiong Bahru.It is part of the excellent Tippling Club group and obverse end by Chef Ryan Clift - and WOW !You wouldn’t know that the whole menu is both gluten and dairy free and so those who are intolerant to either can happily choose from anything off the menu !There is a tasting option , a two course selection or full a la carte.We went with a la carte - sharing an amazing chorizo appetiser with spinach , onions and garlic in a port wine sauce with octopus - so tender and flavoursome .The mains were fish, crab pasta and ossobucco - all cooked to perfection with a superb spinach alio olio and gluten free flatbread.Dessert was split between açai berry soufflé which was SO delicate , and a cheese cake of date and walnut. The fact that they can make a cheesecake out of cashew milk, but tasting like full fat cheesecake ...............just superb !The wine list is limited but excellent - we had a fine Margaret river unoaked Chardonnay at a price that is very competitive by Singapore standards.The service was both knowledgeable and attentive, even with a large party in - we felt as though we were special, which is all you can ask when not regulars.I have reviewed and commended the Tippling Club as one of the best in Singapore - go to Open Door Policy. Different , quirky, out of the CBD , but in every way excellent and well worth the trip (all of 15 minutes from downtown)
3
Really disappointed with the food. It was much better before their change over to gluten free. Service was attentive. Please bring back some of your former dishes like the barramundi and kale soup.
5
Classy and delicious food in the midst of Tiong Bahru made even more value meal with the Entertainer app.
4
Non pretentious place with a nice relaxing vibe. Food was mostly very good, decent price and service was awesome. The apple crumble and cheesecake was delicious. Too bad we were too full to try their fluffy souffle as well. Brunch menu looks great too.
4
Tried different dishes from their interesting and extensive brunch menu. The portions were on the small side and pretty pricy despite quality ingredients.
3
I only looked up TA after having been to this place and I agree with what has been widely written. So overpriced. We only had a few drinks, no food. The menu was tempting but we had already eaten elsewhere.
4
Food is awesome but on the pricey side. No waiting time as i made the reservation via Chope. Food didnt take a long time to arrive.
3
Booked a reservation at 12, arrived 1220, restaurant was quite empty. But waiter said fully booked. Pleasantly seated. Orders taken. Food served fast. Food was great. But after we finished our meal but still have our coffee half done and with restaurant almost full at abt 1pm, our bill was sent to us without us asking for it. Paid and waiter said we have people waiting for the seats. No, there were still empty seats. So, we stayed on for about another 20mins, chilling a bit and was being asked again that the next seating is waiting. There was a couple who came in and without any reservations made. Bar seats were all available and there were still empty seats. But we were chased to leave. I have booked this seating via chope and it was never mentioned in the app nor their website that there was a time limitation in their seating. Waiter said yes, they have, and most of the customers here know. Well, it was our first time and likely the last. Not gonna be nice to be chased away when you just want to chill on a Sunday brunch. Value for money only becos it was an entertainer app discount. Flat white was bad as they use soy milk, tasted so sweet. Food was nice I must say.

Had spent around Sg130 for 2 person.The meal wasn’t great and was too salty.I had miso based pasta which smell fantastic but because of the miso the dish become overly salty. The pasta was over cooked for my liking.My husband had their tempura risotto. Again it’s smell great when served but the saltiness was unbearable. Half way thru the dish, my husband stopped eating. The batter for the tempura was over salted.We had an interesting watercress soup. It’s an interesting twist to usual watercress. This version was liked puréed and creamy unlike our Chinese version. It’s unfortunately not something I will try again but for first timer sure why not.Overall I don’t think the money was well spent and personally will not go again.On the flip side, the services was good and they took notice of the food situation. As a token, they gave me a scoop of banana sorbet which we didn’t really like since we are not a banana fan
1
Hm.. we went on a Monday night, restaurant is quiet but staff is a bit slow and lack of attention as well. Drinks are nice in flavor but presentations a bit mediocre. Food is only average and over prized. Rib eye is thin and served in a cut manner, perhaps a bit deep fried before? I like the spaghetti vongole, spaghetti is cooked like the udon, yummy.
3
The quality of the food is average and nothing special, certainly not worth the price. Would avoid, there are better restaurants nearby
4
Came back here this week for lunch, a welcome break from the crowds in the city. This time I opted for the steak which was served with a small salad and some potatoes. Quite tasty and a good vibe. Not particularly cheap. Worth another visit.
5
The atmosphere is very nice - be sure to book in advance and ask to sit in a sun-light spot. Feel like california vibe. We had Tempura Risotto and Veal with green pea risotto for main dishes - both looked and tasted very nice.
5
This restaurant is 100% gluten and lactose free!! Fine dining with relaxed athmosphere. Very tasty food for everybody and heaven for coeliacs:) Service very polite and knowledgeable :) Thank you guys! :)
4
Worth a visit. Great choice on the menu. Food was tasty especially the fish and gluten free options.
5
First time trying gluten and dairy free food. But the quality and taste is not compromised at all! Makes indulging feels less guilty. Food and service are great though price is on the high side. But the portion and the quality of food makes up for it. Furthermore, they offer interesting brunch options and also available on Entertainer
4
This place is the perfect example of what post-modern Tiong Bahru has to offer, an unique fusion of traditional and hipster feel. The food is good - not great though, we are far from a Michelin-star restaurant. The prices are really way too high though. I would only recommend those who have the entertainer app consider. Even with the app's one-for-one meal code, I paid $60+ for 2 mains and two drinks (and only one was alcohol)
3
Absolutely love this concept & wish there were more GFDF restaurants in Singapore. However, execution could be better. Sausages in our full English breakfast tasted off & the Snow Crab Florentine was way too runny from the soggy spinach mixing with bechamel sauce ended up being a mess. Portions were too small for the high price tag.
3
Located at Yong Siak Street where many other hip and cool restaurants are located. We were there for lunch on Sunday without reservation. Very casual and green ambience with fresh herbs and veggies plants on the wall. Food choice was not boring with interesting ingredients twist (such as Vongole pasta in miso sauce). Wine list is well thought out by category with enough options to choose from.Food portion was relatively small with the $30+/- per main price tag. Maybe weekday set lunch ($25 for 2 course) would be well-worth it
4
Very nice ambience and decor. Ordered the salmon main and the yam rosti during brunch. The wagyu was the perfect medium-rare, and the yam rosti was also very unique. Paired with the tomatoes at the bottom of the layers, it was very delicious. However, the salmon entree seemed overpriced and sad in comparison. It was a tiny slice of salmon amidst like 5 cherry tomatoes and 2 pieces of greens. Not very appetising. I would recommend going for the brunch options
5
My partner and I visited "Open Door Policy" after our flight from Australia, we couldn't have made a better choice!The food is very tasty, and healthy - and for my partner who cannot have gluten or dairy it was a god send to be able to order whatever and know you can eat it.We had the tasting menu which was very reasonably priced, and we were both very satisfied by the end.The restaurant itself is very narrow and has an open kitchen (behind glass) so you can see what's going on, we went mid week and the place wasn't exactly packed
4
it felt like a farm get-away, we almost forgot we were in the middle of the city. the place felt cozy, service was warm, friendly and very prompt. food was nicely presented, ingredients were fresh. over all an excellent lunch among greenery and refreshing surroundings.
5
If you don't want to think so much in front of guests, ODP's tasting menu at $51++ /pax is a perfect option for 3-4 persons who will share between 3 starters + 2 mains.
Food was fresh and well plated !
4
Went with a party of 4. Ordered 4 mains using the entertainer app. Food was delicious, really like the ambience of the place too.
5
Small but wonderful menu that can accomodate vegan diets in a trendy exp-pat area. Highly recommend. Great meeting place and coffee.
4
Dined here a couple of times as it's in the neighbourhood. The Kings Crab was good with a generous portion though I wouldn't recommended the smoked salmon.
4
Tried out the five course tasting menu at Open Door Policy. The food and service was good - all in all a pleasant experience.
3
First thing- we went for dinner and it was bloody freezing! If they are going to keep the AC so Low they should advise patrons to bring a hat and coat.Food was average. I had a 'rack of pork' which turned out not to be a rack but one rib and two other bits of meat. Pork can be bland if not properly cooked and seasoned and this was the case here. My Wife had a steak served 'Blue'. It was tough and a bit stringy. On the plus side the watercress soup to start was good.Apple crumble was also good.Waiter was very attentive at the start but faded away. Was not overly interested when we mentioned the tough steak.Would not go bac

ProsHad an amazing meal at Open Door Policy, cannot remember the last time I was able to eat a three course meal at a non vegan specific restaurant. The food was delicious, and beautifully presented, and the concept well thought out. The ambience was lovely, greenery on the walls, decorated very uniquely and nice and relaxing when the restaurant was emptier at the beginning of the meal.The staff were very polite and attentive.The service was quick and efficient. ConsThe meal was quite expensive $220 for two people, however we both did have three courses, a cocktail and a side to share. Further to this most of the portions were quite small. The tables are quite close together so it can be a little difficult to hear each other talking when the restaurant is full
3
Delighted to see a restaurant we loved go gluten and dairy free! Last time we ate here the food and service was excellent.Be warned, the tables are extremely close together, the air conditioning is very cold (the person at the next table had goosebumps, it wasn't just us) and it is so noisy because of people yelling to be heard over the restaurant's loud music.This meant it was so uncomfortable and we couldn't stay for lunch. It might be unfair to write a review without tasting the food on this visit, but I hope this information will help people make a decision about whether this restaurant is suitable for them. (I'm in my 30's, not too much of an old fogey btw!) Noise levels and surroundings affect our experiences and may be a deciding factor for you too.I am glad they are popular though! More gluten and dairy free menus please :

My husband and I ate at ODP last night. I had the "Take the A Train" cocktail - it was so refreshing and yummy: apple juice, pear brandy, and vodka! I'm now on the hunt for pear brandy. We had the crab and avocado appetizer - it was so, so good. The dark "chips" the served with it perfectly complimented the dish. My husband had the threadfin, which he said was delicious. Sadly, it is over-fished. Please reconsider a more sustainable fish? I had the osso buco, which I haven't had in over 10 years because it's veal, but it was superb. The accompanying green pea risotto was excellent, and the beet garnish added a great, crunchy texture to the dish. The service was attentive and warm. We will be back
4
I love the food at OPD. Great gluten free options even on the dessert menu. No compromise on the taste. Service staff were friendly and very obliging.
4
Unique concept, great service and atmosphere. Unfortunately, the steak fell short of expectations as it was served medium well (overcooked as medium rare was requested).
4
Luckily we made the reservation before we go. otherwise it was supposed to queue during lunch time..
4
Good foods and nice restaurant. Prefer to have more variety of main foods for dinner. The wasabi soup is enlightening.
3
Food is good, but nothing special. Not really worth the price. Nice to get the healthier options though.
1
Brought my family to Tiong Bahru last weekend, thinking we could have a hearty brunch in an old neighbourhoold. We walked into a half empty OPD cos the other more popular cafes were full. We should have suspected something.The prices seemed reasonable (around S$26 for Egg Benedict) till we were served with half the portion that we expect normally. They arrived immediately too which means the eggs and other ingredients were prepared well in advance.My daughter was immediately disappointed with the taste, and googled for OPD reviews. Then we realised OPD started to serve 100% dairy- and gluten-free menu a month ago. No wonder!I think it is good for OPD to cater to customers who are on this diet but they should be upfront in their signage or their staff should at least explain the menu to first-timers like us
5
I would like to thank Open Door Policy's service and kitchen team for making David and my dinner a lovely memorable one! Gorgeous simple food and great service.Thank you once againDefinitely will come backTwo thumbs up guys!Keep up the good workSophi

[Note: I have a gluten allergy but not to the most sensitive extreme. I don't have a significant (if any) reaction to foods made in the same kitchen or fried in the same oil as non-gluten free foods.]I ate at Open Door Policy on a Sunday night, my last meal in Singapore before traveling home. What a treat for someone with a gluten allergy: An entire menu to choose from. While the portions were small and the place was rather empty, I left full and didn't care to be in a buzzy scene on a Sunday night anyway. It's a beautiful space
3
Given that it was listed in Singapore 2017 Michelin Guide, it should be worth to try... My wife and I ordered their recommended dishes - sautéed chorizo & octopus salad, braised veal ossobuco and grilled argentiean steak. Verdict: Overrated, average at best. The combination of ingredients and balance of flavours is really mediocre. Not worth the price charged. Should have read TripAdvisor reviews before making the dinner reservation
4
High quality cooking in intimate setting, opportunity to view the chefs cooking. Avocado salted egg prawn with kale crisp starter 8/10, wonderful. Braised Osso buco with pea risotto main 9/10, fantastic. Cherry and green tea chocolate soufflé 6/10, undercooked. Decent global wines by the glass, so we had 3 between us @ $18 per glass. Portions enough for 2. $145 incl 10% service all in.
2
Nice ambience, attentive staff, and decent food but three brunch dishes and two coffees at $100+ seems a bit too overpriced. Quite a lot of overpriced cafe/restaurants in Singapore and this place is definitely one of them.
5
the food was awesome. with an impressive, tasty gluten free selection. serice was excellent. smiley wait staff who were quick but not harried. lovely ambience with pots of fresh herbs lining the restaurant walls. refreshing!
3
We were there with friends and enjoyed a good spread recommended and designed for us by the Chef. Most delicious food.
4
Loved the interior with green and wood. Lot of options for gluten free and a nice value for money set menu. Would visit again.
4
Great, healthy food although it's quite pricey. Lucky that we have the Entertainer app 1 for 1 which made it worth it
2
For the type of food served and location, this place is over priced. Had lunch on a week day and for two pax (one main course + one coffee per person), the cash resgister rang up to S$80+ dollars!
4
Nice flavors, especially the chorizo octopus. The quail was dry. The atmosphere was pleasant and the wine tasty.
4
I celebrated my birthday at Open Door Policy, but service was not that great. There was no offer by the waitress to offer plates or forks for my cake - they just handed over the entire cake (which we had brought to the restaurant) in its original state, that is, in the plastic bag. Also, my mom asked for hot water, but was served lukewarm water instead.
4
Not many Sunday brunch places in the Tiong Bahru area. As such, this was crowded and you need a reservation especially on a Sunday. Wish I knew that before I decided to go there for Sunday brunch. The staff was kind and allowed me to sit at the counter without reservation. I had the English breakfast which turned out to be a favorite. Substantial!
4
Smoothing ambience with the theme of eco-friendly/hygge. Had mackerel, a refreshing taste of green curry but the portion is small even for a small eater. Steak is good, the right amount of done-ness, hues of pink, without much blood. Tender. Salad sauce is good too. Celery soup with supposedly Hokkaido scallops, the scallops are of smaller size compared to what I had from other places. Overall its a pleasant experience and will revisit the place.
3
Concept and ambience was great. However, food portions were small and a tad too salty. Slightly pricey.
3
Have been visiting many times and recommended to many during last 2 years , loves the concept , food and the atmosphere but recently it seems that the overall food quality is dropping , please keep it up
5
Nice and healthy food. Innovative creative ideas . Nice decoration and gluten free diet. Fish and stew very refreshing.
5
Have had dinner here four or five times and it is always good. Actually had my 50th birthday party here with friends. Fresh food and a great ambiance and definitely worth a visit. Also located on one of the list interesting streets in Singapore.
4
Fantastic menu and food. But limited choices make it hard for some dinners. Needs more options. Particularly as the Hake wasn't available that night
3
good selection of mains. portion slightly small.
desserts selection not exciting though
service standards could be improved also as i needed to wait to get attention of servers for quite long and walk up to them once too.
2
The menu is varied and has nice dishes. The food tastes pretty good, however the portions are way too small. I left my lunch feeling hungry and getting more and much cheaper food across the street. The prices are quite high for the portion size and therefore I feel that the value for money is just not there.The service is quick but that's because many of the dishes have been prepared in advance. I sat at the bar looking straight into the kitchen. The rosti, eggs, bread to name a few were all prepared before and just heated up on the stove or with a torch(!). My second trip to ODP will be my last
4
I went for brunch, and the food was so good. It took less than 10 minutes to serve what I ordered, and i ordered quite a fair bit. The drinks were also very good, and had very interesting flavors. It was a refreshing experience. The staff was really attentive, and I barely had to ask for anything. They were quite pleasant.The lighting was quite weird as the warm lights indoors mixed with the natural light from the outside. Certainly not a deal breaker, though. The staff politely asked us to leave after some time, though, and that almost messed up my experience. (The reservations were for 90 minutes only, i think.) I'd have hoped for a more considerate way of managing that, though, because there will a few vacant tables, so there shouldn't really be a mad rush to make us leave. (I did order quite a lot, too, so it wasn't like I was sitting there wihout earning them money.)Anyway, it was still a good experience.
3
at first the service staff was attentive then after i asked if i could use the entertainer app. service dropped to an all time low. food was decent. when i asked for the bill. the service staff just left the bill on the table without saying a word. i believe in coming back only for good service. too bad
1
Can't fault the food, BUT how about you spruce up your service? Have been to ODP on numerous occasions but guys come on! No greeting from the young woman who showed us to our table and when we ordered two flat whites, were answered with "soy." Was that a question? No -- "we only do soy milk now." I have no issue with soy milk but staff should be able to explain this properly rather than giving cryptic one-word answers -- especially as it's not mentioned on the menu. Service from this individual remained monosyllabic and offhand throughout the meal and the experience was not a comfortable one. Kudos to the young man who sensed our discomfort and did his best to make up for his colleague's rudeness. There's lots of competition in the area now -- patrons will go elsewhere if made to feel unwelcome by your staff.
3
the quality of the food was fresh and one is able to taste the naturally flavours of the produce. However the food was pricey for it is,
4
Ordered the veal carrot rissotto. It was incredible. The veal was done really well and each component matches is amazing. One of the best dishes I've had this year.
5
The food we ordered was delicious and the restaurant had a really nice ambience. We really enjoyed our meal and experience at Open Door Policy. We will recommend this place to our friends and family.
4
It was our first visit and it was a great experience. Food was great and the place was well designed. Thank you :)
5
Interesting and yummy food. Love their decoration and the general feel of the place. Great service too!
4
This must be the only full GF restaurant in Singapore. Good food and good service. What else can you ask for?
2
The food wasn't good, it was over rated and not worth the money spent. Service was good and attentive though.
4
We enjoyed seats at the bar watching the chefs in the open kitchen prepare dishes for the hungry punters. It may not be cheap but it has quality and charisma in the old art deco building in Yong Siat St. Definitely worth a visit and the beef cheek I had was delicious.
1
I had high expectations since the reviews were good and there was a good turnout at the restaurant. However, was soon enough disappointed. The service was perfunctory and almost mechanical. No warmth was felt from the service staff at all. The food was horrible. The spaghetti was overcooked and the ravioli tasted off. Not value for money at all...
2
Waiter serving us was nice but grossly incompetent. Also while trying to claim a offer via and app that ODP is on, the waiter was adamant that their T&Cs didn't include brunch however it was not stated within the app. We understood that it didn't apply so we didn't press on the bill but we were adamant that the policy be reviewed within the app as it was misleading. The waiter was very rude about it and kept insisting that it was in their T&Cs implying that we were not willing to take his word for it and wanting the discount to be honoured. Not the first time one of us has experienced this arrogant service in ODP. Food's good but for the price and the crappy service, I will not be returning.
3
We had a great diner with 6 people, all dishes were quite nice. However ending the great food festivity ended with a great price tag as well.
4
Everything was really good. I enjoyed the antipasti, the steak was really well done and spaghetti. A bit disappointed by the desserts.
4
Expensive but good! I find the normal menu better than the brunch menu. Good service. Should expand the menu
2
We had high hopes as we had been there before. This time was special as we were celebrating my daughter's 18th. So disappointed with the food. Understand that the menu had changed but it wasn't good enough.
3
Great ambience, but the space is quite crammed. There wasn't much space between tables and they lost our reservation. But staff was quick to rectify that. Service wasn't great although the food was served out rather quickly.
5
Quiet lunch. Decent food, attentive service. Expect a modest portion for set lunch. A return trip after quite a while, but pleased to see the standard remains. Photographers may like the diffused natural lighting inside the restaurant
5
As a gluten and dairy intolerant, I was very delightful to discover that I could choose anything from the menu without restriction ! And on top of that, everything is good, creative, tasteful, flavored ! A place to go and go again !!! Highly recommended 
3
I dined in and tried to order 'feed me' and was told by the staff that I'm not allowed to order because it's usually for at least two persons, which made me very sad, so I followed their advise and ordered Hake and the Chocolate soufflÃ© dessert, they are both good, but below my expectation, but the evergreen juice is really nice, fresh and delicious, really enjoyed it.
5
This restaurant provided me with hands down the best gluten free meal I've ever had out. Service was lovely, a nice quiet little restaurant which is very rustic. Wherever you're staying in Singapore, head here. It's not really ideally located, but not too bad by Uber. Hopefully they'll get bigger and open in Australia!! (Fingers crossed) And feels amazing as a coeliacs to be able to order anything off the menu
4
This place had a great selection of gluten free, dairy free, organic meals. I didnt specifically come for that, just stumbled upon the place. From the outside it doesnt look like much but inside it has a cool industrial kind of look. Kitchen is open and you can see the chefs preparing everything. I had the soul sauce juice and the sweet potato hash. Both were very tasty and good. It is a little pricey but given the quality natural ingredients that is not a surprise.Really nice place with great staff. RegardsOma
4
The food tastes great! The main course portion is just nice for one person. I like their wines too! It's just a bit cramp inside but that's the space constraints. Recommended.
3
The environment was quite lovely, with many plants around but the food was definitely not value for money with its small portion.
5
Friendly and attentive staff, innovative and well prepared food,summing our experience up, this restaurant has much to offer.
5
My tenth time here due to my gluten free diet. Not alot of options here for mains but the food was wonderful and carefully prepared. They are also dairy free. Friendly servers too.
4
As with all fine dining places, food is normally slightly in the expensive side and not very filling. The steak was really good. But the quail was a little tiny piece. Their desserts looked good but we didn't go for them, $16 a dish! Really nice setting though, makes a great romantic night out
3
We were really impressed by the atmosphere as it was cosy with nice interior. But when the food came in and we took the first bite we got so dissapointed. It had hitten nice taste and great combinations, but it was really washed out and had not been made out of love. It has so much potential to become great and leave a good taste in your mouth, but not this one..
4
ODP has changed into gluten free and dairy free restaurant in mid 2016. Preferred the old menu and concept. We did not know about the changes and bookee ODP for a birthday celebration and they insisted we could not consume our cheese cake (birthday cake) on site which was disappointing
3
My friends and I ordered the Eggs Benedict and for the price, we expected it to taste better. Instead of the usual hollandaise sauce, it has hints of coconut flavour to it. Instead of muffins, they use Pita bread instead, which we found slightly soggy. We wanted to order fries to share but they only had potatoes and some steamed veg etc which might be great if you are watching your diet. Service was pretty prompt and servers were friendly.
4
We went there for a group meal with visitors from various counties. Very interesting food and tastes. I am veggie but not gluten intolerant and there was enough options for me to choose from; I found it interesting how they used different and unusual ingredients to create dishes. Desserts were very tasty too! Would go ahead, perhaps in a smaller group so I can focus more on the food!

The food selections we had were good and the company was pleased with every dish. Ambience-wise, the lighting could be a little better, and the menu a little longer. For example, I felt that, for a green place, there should be at least one green salad available. Other than that, I'm all too happy for a place that is both gluten and dairy free!
4
I was excited when it stated gluten and diary free restaurant. I am allergy to diary and my friend is allergy to wheat. It is a perfect place for us to hang out. The pasta and dessert are really good.
5
Everything here is gluten free. So there is no worries of cross contamination. The food are excellent and delicious. The only gripe is the price is on the high side.
5
Imagine not having to quiz the wait staff on the ingredients of every dish? Absolutely delicious gluten free food. Quite pricey though.
2
Food with no taste. Cakes not freshly baked, fish with no flavour. The only thing good is the sweet potatoe fries.
4
This is probably the most expensive cafe restaurant in Tiong Bahru. Food was exceptional but portion could have been bigger.
4
Completely GF and dairy free menu. For me great to see although I don't have an issue with dairy. Heads up, corkage is around $40 a bottle- so much for the Australian influence. Warm chorizo and octopus salad probably the highlight. My Wife enjoyed the chocolate soufflé and my dairy free cheesecake was light and very tasty. Osso buco was a bit bland. We got there at 7 and they were out of the almond cauliflower scallop soup which sounded good. Be prepared to hear neighbouring tables conversation. If you have been married a Long time that could be a bonus.Overall a good experience

The food was good, the service was average, the bill was more than it should have been. We had 6 mains and deserts that cost $440 or $73 per pax when in fact they were probably worth $50 per pax and should not have cost more than $300. That's almost 50% more than they should have cost. The restaurant is not in a "high rent" part of town so there's not that excuse for the prices. My rating is "poor" because it was poor value for money. The food was good but over-priced. You can get food this good at better prices so there's no need to come here and pay over the market for it. Sorry to say it was not worth the price
5
Loved how the menu was short and concise, yet each dish was screaming for you to order it! Started with the endives, and had the GF orecchiette and veal risotto for mains, and ended with the soy and palm sugar gelato sundae. Everything went down incredibly well and I cant wait to come back to try out the date and walnut DF cheesecake! :
5
Even if this had not been a gluten+diary free restaurant, I would have given the place a positive rating for the creative dishes, pleasant atmosphere and friendly service. In addition, it perfectly catered to my husband who deals with quite a few dietary restrictions. Highly recommended if you're with someone who would love a gluten+diary free mac and cheese, or date walnut cake, or choco soufflé. And they have healthy normal stuff, too, for me

Our family of 4, all had a 5 course tasting menu. You don't know what you're being served in advance. First two were very nice, third (pasta) with lobster bisque was flavorless. But the fourth dish was really bad. Poultry with chick peas. There was a bad taste and smell. After complaining twice, the waiter asked me to try a specific ingredient, vanilla oil. That was wat causes the strange flavour. I seems the cook uses vanilline, a chemical vanilla because the chemical taste was very dominant. He took back the dish of all four of us and didn't suggest a replacement. This was the waiters opportunity to show some service which he didn't. The bill, including four wine and some water was 430 dollars. You would expect more service to keep the customer happy. Very disappointed
5
A dream for this Coeliac visiting Singapore. Not the cheapest food but delicious and staff lovely. Would highly recommend.
5
Imagine a restaurant where you don't need to quiz the wait staff on what each dish contains. Sound good? Well Open Door Policy is that restaurant. Delicious food and safe for coeliacs. I'll be back to try more from their menu.
3
Food is excellent and if you sit at the counter then it's interesting to see into the kitchen. The look and design is smart and inviting. The service is the weakness. On arrival the booking was there but couldn't be found - so 2 minutes spent awkwardly standing around. While okay the service was not the level of unobtrusive attentiveness to match the otherwise high standards - even at less than full house. For that, given the prices, I can only give an overall "Average"
4
Good European food, in a nice setting. ODP has survived for several years (unusual in Singapore's fast changing landscape) which supports the concept that the good quality and simple menu supports repeated visits.Not that convenient for the major sites, but a short cab ride from the center
4
Our friends brought us here before and I would say it is one of the best western restaurants in Singapore. It's a narrow restaurant but the cooking is honest with interesting ingredients like King Paiche from the Amazon. I had the rib eye steak which was very good. Now the place is gluten free. Highly recommended.
4
The interior layout isn't great - everyone is against a wall and the aisle is cramped. But get blown away by the chic vibe and a surprising delicious food. Menu and drink list is quite limited. The waitstaff is very professional. Make sure to reserve a table as the place gets packed nightly
3
Service was good, not intrusive. Our waiter realised as he was serving our first cocktails that the wrong drinks were mixed and replaced them without issue.Food was hit and miss. Guacamole Risotto was fresh and interesting combo that sort of works; Lamb rump a bit of a mess of flavours; not sure about combining Cod with masala flavours, I couldn't finish that one.Not sure this is somewhere I'll rush to go back to, there are probably better eateries
4
Had dinner here for the first time last night. We had the baked Camembert. Delicious, as was the bread. Hubby had the lamb, while I had the barramundi. Both were very nice. Cocktails were excellent. I had a grapefruit Julep and he had a gin cucumber drink, can't recall the name. Service was excellent, some of the best we have had here. Had a couple of nice glasses of wine too for less than 20 per glass, pretty reasonable. Funky and cool atmosphere. There is a great bookstore a couple doors down and a couple of really fun shops. Loads of spots for coffee or desserts after dinner. I would highly recommend as a different Neighbourhood and nice chill spot. We will be back! Diverse patrons. Didn't see any kids there, which we see as a plus. Looks like a great brunch there as well.

Heard my friends talk abt this place and my boss recommending me this place to bring my client here, I decide to check out this place. Reach there at about 8 pm and luckily there are seats for 2 of us. We are not sure what is nice so we opted for the feed us which is chef selection on what they want to feed us. Is about 51 I think for a main and starter and there are 2 of us so they will chose different dishes so that we can try and share. What I like about this concept is that U may be eating food that you will never chose yourself so it can be a surprise or shock...so verdicts are... We are surprised and pleased.Starters are crab cake and chorizos. These are amazing...crab cake is crispy and really tasty with the veg below the crab cakes. Love the chorizos with squid too. Main are beef cheek and lamb. The lamb is tender and without the usual lamby taste. It is good but I prefer my Lamb roasted and really cripsy so this is a nice dish but not wow. The beef cheek is wow wow... Love it!Overall service is very friendly, they explain the dish and when I was peeping at others food the waiter even tell me what other is having! Nice place as well and definitely good for friends and even business. Love this place and will be back

Wow this place used to be smik, funky, vibrant, serving amazing food with brilliant service  Decided to entertain a client for dinner. It has lost its edge!!. Visual presentation is vital. Kitchen which is a feature being open and a showcase! needs a total tidy up, looking at messy shelves is disturbing. The food crab cakes! One large one cut in half "totally boring with overpowering sauce and oil " client had the wakame and romaine salad. Left 3/4 of itWe both had the tortellini with yabbies "Me being from a farming community in Victoria originally i talked them up" The yabbies and tortellini were great however smothered in far to much pesto they were spoilt. Sad to see a restaurant loose focus and consistency.
4
Tasty food and reasonably good value, the beef cheek was excellent!
Good atmosphere, selection of cocktails pretty good but could do with a more extensive wine list.
5
Had a faboulous lunch at this place, the service was attentive and fast, food was so delicious, price is affordable
4
Place still served fresh and sumptuous food. Menu has changed and vegetarian options reduced. Service is still great.
Needs to add some options for vegetarian persons.

Four of us ordered brunch and I think the best one could be what my husband had which is the eggs benedict with ham (looks more like bacon). I had crepe topped with trout and mixed with guacamole and cheese. I forgot what my two friends had but one came in a long soft bun which he didn't like it very much as it was messy to eat (eggs slipping off the top of the sandwich)Usually I would take a picture of the receipt to remember name of dishes but this time I forgot so the best I could do is to describe the dishes and took photos of them. The portion was very small. The trout dish has a lot of cheese and it was a bit overwhelming for me. I would have liked to have a hinge of lime or some citrus in the dish. The avocado in the dish was nice too but again the texture of the dish was uniform except for the crispy white cracker as a decoration piece on top. The Eggs Benedict tasted much better and there is more substance to the dish ie something to chew not just swallow. The juice was in a tiny glass cub with a tiny straw like those used for a cocktail drink. It is overly expensive in my opinion. Average cost of dish is about $26-30 so it is pricey for the portion but worth it considering the ambience and if you only go there occasionally. It is not a place I would go regularly

Visited here about a month or two ago after reading all the positive reviews. Unfortunately we were appalled at how bad the food was, can't believe all the positive reviews, it's like others are describing a completely different restaurant. Neither of us liked our dishes, which were bland and lacking in any flavour. The Indian bread starter was literally the only thing that tasted ok. The place was full of fruit flies, with one landing in one of our drinks. This alone hints that there are serious hygiene issues in the place. Hoped dessert might save it, but that was poor too. The cocktails were hit and miss. If I'd paid $30 for our meal I'd have been annoyed, but for close to $300 for two people, I'm disgusted. Will never set foot in here again.
4
We managed to get a table at short notice for dinner last night (Saturday). This was our second recent visit, the previous one with work colleagues had definitely warranted 4 stars and a revisit. We chose the baked camembert to share as a starter. This had been excellent previously but we think was rather unripe as it was rubbery and disappointing. The crab cakes, barramundi and cauliflower side were great. The menu is interesting, the staff are attentive and service was nicely paced; the restaurant has a very nice ambiance. I have given it another 4 on the basis of the aggregate score of two meals but last night's probably only deserved a 3
4
Nice place to have Brunch. Good Ambience. Relaxing atmosphere as it was Not as busy when we had early brunch (11am)Among the 4 mains we ordered, we liked both the beef and the risotto (from the lunch menu)Our favorite was the dessert : apple crumble. Freshly Baked, served hot and yummy.
1
Went here with a group of friends and decided for ease that we would go with the set menu at $35 a head. Let me tell you - it was a complete rip off. First course, soup, was barely five tablespoons full. Sure, it tasted nice, but I barely got a real feel for the flavour before it was gone. Next was the salmon main. My piece of salmon was the size of a business card. Obviously the Chef decided a table full of ladies would be watching their weight and decided to put us on rationed portions. Lastly, dessert. Chocolate cake. Or should I say chocolate crumbs. It looked like the chef had broken off teeny tiny pieces from a cake out the back, the placed the meagre samples next to a teaspoon size bit of ice cream. After ordering a tea to try and satisfy the starving hole in my stomach, I asked for my bill. It came to just shy of $50. $50 for a drip of soup, a thumbnail of fish and cake crumbs. Outrageous. Luckily there was a bakery just on the road so I could get something to eat. So if you're looking for a great, value for money set lunch - this isn't it
2
Whilst this restaurant has always been overpriced, it was definitely worth it for the potato roti/scrambled eggs/sausage combo. I used to come here every weekend and also bring friends from overseas when they would visit and we would always leave full, satisfied and not mind paying the high prices. After our visit today, we will never be going back. In fact we had to find a hawker centre on the way home as we were still so hungry and unsatisfied.Since the menu change, where they have moved to being more 'style over substance' I can guarantee that I will not go back. The rosti was the best thing on the menu by far and since removing that, as well as charging higher prices for less food, we have left completely disappointed. ODP has gone from being our favourite brunch place to somewhere we would never go back to in the space of two weeks. The scotch egg with curry and lamb is too small, the pork sausage hot dog bun invention doesn't work, and the mozzarella dish is overfried and just too heavy. I will add that the service is fantastic, however they are let down by a menu that is overcomplicated, not substantial enough, and have removed the most popular dish on the menu (the potato rosti).My advice to the ODP management - if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Bring back the potato rosti

Went for lunch with a colleagues, 10 of us. Location is great with great restaurants nearby. That unfortunately means stiff competition. Open door policy is a small, neat place tucked away in this hip neighborhood and this place has been talked about a fair bit. So I went with high expectations and came away with mixed feelings. Ordered chorizo, Kale broth and crab cakes to start. Chorizo was bit too salty and the squid would tire Violet Beaugarde of chewing(at least it was fresh). Kale broth was refreshing with quail eggs and the pea salad base for crab cakes were good. Crab cakes themselves were average tasting. Mains - Lamb, beef cheek and cod fish were awesome. Beef cheek deserves a super special mention- I know what I'm going to order the next time I'm here !If you stick to the few tasty items on the menu you will be wowed else you feel slightly deflated. Price point is not exactly cheap- might give the set lunch a go
5
The food was excellent; tasty, tender, interesting. The staff are excellent, not at all intrusive. The setting is lovely, good lighting, not too noisy.
Dessert also fabulous.
A gentle 10-minute stroll from the MRT.
5
Totally rate this little gem of an eatery. It's small, the food is totally delicious and its modern. Wish London had more little restaurants like this. In a non-descript are of Singapre, don't let this our you off!
4
This is a cafe that is in the neighbourhood. Nice ambience, nice coffee. A restaurant where you never expect to be so good hidden within the central.
5
the location is a way from famous orchard road, dont have a big sign board, but after u try the meals all time spend searching this resto is paid.
1
For the amount of staff they employ, you would expect good service, but this place is just appalling. Definitely not worth the price you pay for what you get in return. Overhyped. Fortyhands across the street beats this place by miles.
3
I've been meaning to come here for ages but never found the time. We finally came for a Saturday brunch and were seated at the bar looking in on the kitchen without reservations required. The place was pretty full when we arrived (mostly ex-pats). We ordered 2 different bloody mary's which were pretty light on the booze. I enjoyed mine but my partner was not pleased with his anemic drink. We had eggs benny and a burger. Neither really impressed us although there was nothing wrong with it. Felt like something I could have made at home. Others seemed to enjoy it so maybe it's just us. I've not been impressed with any of Ryan Clift's restaurants. Maybe I don't share his taste for food. I find it rather ordinary and not worth the relatively high price charged. Service was extraordinarily slow to the point that the waiter apologized about 3 times. Fortunately we weren't in a rush or particularly famished but it could be quite frustrating to see about 8 egg bennies being cooked and NOT delivered to your table! =
5
Love the open kitchen concept and his cozy is the restaurant is. You can hear the chefs working on their dishes and even enjoy their cooking talents by sitting on the kitchen bar seats. Surprise me menu did us some great dinners combination and the food was lovely. Service flow smoothly and always comes with a smileWorth a try although is not on a budget side
4
I was staying around the corner so popped in here for an early dinner.Of course it's not cheap but the crab cake starter on a pea mash was really delicious. The barramundi main course was similarly tasty although the broth that it came in didn't have much flavour.I had three glasses of wine and the total came to >S$100 so of course it's pricey but this is clearly a popular restaurant with regulars and the staff were very friendly.I liked it and if I'm in the area again I would return
3
it's my second time back at open door policy. the food is hit and misses but the service definitely needs working upon. Sunday brunches are (usually) meant to be greeted with smiley faces but the service staff are no smiles and need to be more friendly with the service.prices are a bit steep and the portions are small and the ingredients used are average.
5
My first visit was just for a drink and atmosphere was great for a cosy catch up with a group of friends. Second visit was based on recommendation by my friend. We ordered beef cheeks, salmon & kale broth. The broth was carefully prepared in a little pitcher and served by pouring all over the pieces of kale (think they were toasted till crispy) line at the based of the plate. The main highlight of the night was the beef cheeks! This beef cheeks was not even anything that looks extraordinary but the texture was unbelievable! It literally melts in one's mouth! This is definitely something that I will recommend to all my friends who are looking out for quality food
5
Lovely food and great service, maybe a bit pricey but nice! Spent a lovely evening here and can recommend it to anyone.
5
This is definitely a pricy dining option. We went for breakfast a couple weeks ago. The decor is excellent- service is excellent- food was mostly excellent (get the truffle scrambled eggs, so good!)- coffee is pretty darn good- prices very high.
2
Went for the Champagne brunch where is the idea is you can pay $50 for unlimited top ups of champagne. It is advertised as lasting from 11am to 3pm both online and at the tables. When we arrived we were advised the free flow only lasts for 1.5 hrs. So be warned this is what to expect. It has to be noted that as my party of 4 was clearly disappointed and were considering going elsewhere they offered us an extra half hour which we accepted.The place and staff look great. Trendy, hipster place. I am sure this has been the focus. The food was quite good, however is very expensive, especially when comparing to other places serving much better food in much nicer restaurant's.The staff were a mixed bag. A few were nice enough and were what I would expect. A few however had very poor attitudes and I would go as far as to say would stop me going back. The free flow champagne service gets much slower as the time goes on and we felt some of the staff were actively trying to minimise how much champagne we could consume as if it was their champagne.Overall I doubt I will go back. If you want brunch I think it is overpriced, if you want Champagne brunch then pay a little bit extra and go to one of the hotels doing it properly
4
Have eaten here a number of times over the past 2 months. The food is good - inventive, well presented and with robust flavours. The lobster soup, roast baramundi, soufle and apple crumble were particularly tasty. Reasonable portion sizes. Price is average for Singapore restaurants of this quality. The one issue with this restaurant is the service. On some days it is outstanding and attentive, even when the restaurant is busy. On other days, even when not crowded, it is indifferent with forgotten orders and an inability to get the food for my dining companions to arrive at the table at the same time.At our latest visit, we had no complaints on either the quality of the food or service
3
Two of us went to ODP without reservations. The person that greeted us was willing to give us a table as long as we left by 8;30. She reminded us 3 times during our meal to the point where it really took away from it. The food was good. I had barramundi and the taste was interesting. However, I still felt hungry after. For the price we paid I would have expected a more generous portion and more imaginative food. Good, but not somewhere I'd have to go again
2
Very small portions, yet quite expensive : starters at above $20.Octopus terrine was good. The rest was poor :seafood risotto very heavy with very little seafood in it...avocado risotto too creamy and lamb ragout pasta also way too fat..Wine by the glass are expensive, yet small.Lastly, high prices on the menu would lead you to think that tax and service are included as there is no mention of them being excluded nor is there the usual ++ sign.Service was unapologetic in front of those frustrations
4
Wait staff were really friendly and attentive. We felt so welcome in the restaurant. The French toast was beautifully done - crisp on the exterior and soft interior. It was not greasy and not overwhelmingly sweet - balanced! Friend was really contented with the truffle eggs and the green eggs Benedict add a touch of uniqueness to the dish
4
We had the 5 course taster menu which I have to say from the lamb spring rolls to the final course sweet, with popping candy included was very tasty. Ambiance was ok but a bit tight with our backs to the main walk way. The service was impeccable, the negative was the price at S$68++ for the taster menu which were portions enough but when you add in a couple of bottles wine the price was a tad expensive. Worth a try though, if your on a budget however maybe steer clear or don't have the alcohol
4
Nice peaceful ambience. Must have: 1. Eggs benedict with/without chicken (I'm a vegetarian and just by looking at the dish I thought of veering from the vegetarian ways). My friends told me it was super yummy and perfectly cooked.2. This is our real purpose of the visits to ODP: buttermilk pancake with creme patisserie, poached strawberries & ice cream I went with friends who were travelling internationally and had a stopover in Singapore. This place was the perfect hangout for us as it was a weekend and we all wanted to relax, have some happy food after a hectic week. I had a ODP breakfast (customized to vegetarian) burger and it was well cooked and nicely presented. The potato rosti and french toast could've been better
4
This place is tucked away in the trendy Tiong Bahru area of Singapore. A bit difficult to find but worth a trip. They offer a good lunch set that comes with a glass of wine. The nice food is prepared in an open kitchen right in front of your eyes. Will go again.
4
Recently they have changed the menu, but the food is still very good. Nice selection. Necessary to book in advance. Closed on Mondays, but still a great place to go out with friends or as a couple for a nice dinner.
5
We took the 'Feed Me' five course option that was perfectly balanced and just right. The service is great and with a full restaurant the ambience was perfect. Prices are sensible and a must visit restaurant in a historic part of Singapore
5
Went here with friends from Singapore it was great, slightly more pricy than my usual haunts (wine expensive) but good. The food and service were excellent with no complaints a busy small buzzy place...recommended!
5
It’s been some time since I last visited. I heard that the restaurant has new additions to their menu and I came by with my colleague for lunch. We were hungry and ordered quite a few dishes to try.Starters- Crab Cakes: $20. These were decent sized, which is good for 4! Its packed full of crab meat and nothing else. Its coated with breadcrumbs before being deep fried. Its served with pea salad tossed with sauce gribiche and mint oil. The pea salad was interesting, as it has a nice crunch. It reminds me a lot of a coleslaw, with a celery taste.- Spicy Lamb Spring Rolls: $20. This has a bit of Morrocan feel to it. Minced spiced lamb wrapped in a spring roll and deep fried. Its served with dollops of yoghurt and avocado, and fresh salsa. Loved the presentation. Good sized portions!- Warm Octopus Terrine: $21. The octopus leg is sous-vide into a terrine, sliced thinly and layered on a plate with a drizzle of preserved lemon dressing. Its then garnished with garlic and parsley potatoes, cherry tomatoes and Romanesco. The octopus were really tender and tasty with the dressing. Really good. Must-order!- Guacamole Risotto: $20. Interesting, a avocado-guacamole risotto, with yoghurt and poached free range hen’s egg. The egg had an orange yolk, which the staff said only comes with free range eggs. Its really yummy. Must-try!Mains- Braised Beef cheek; $32. 48 hour sou-vide cooked at 62 degrees. It’s served with black truffle mash, roasted mushroom, squid ink breadcrumbs and red wine jus. Beef was tender and came apart easily when I dug in. Tasty and yummy. Recommended!- Roast Barramundi: $26. Loved the presentation. Two pieces of barramundi pan roasted and placed in a granite bowl atop a bed of wasabi flavoured mash potato, shimeji mushrooms, sea asparagus and lotus root. A small jug of hot dashi gauzzetto is provided that you pour into the bowl. On the side is fried sago sprinkled with shiso pepper that you can add to the soup for added spice. Fish is fresh and everything came together well. Nice!- Kangaroo Fillet: $34. The kangaroo loin was cooked sous-vide for 40 minutes before being grilled. Served with roast brussel sprouts, pine nuts with bacon and baby onions, sautéed warrigal greens and vinegar jus. It taste like duck breast meat. The meat doesn’t feel gamey at all. The pine nuts with bacon is also good. Dessert- Espresso Espuma: $18. Its really light. It has brownie cookies at the bottom and a buckwheat caramel bar on the top of the glass. Ladies will love this. Must-try!- Passionfruit & Chocolate Tart: $18. The Guayaquil’s bitter ganache, with the cocoa beans from Equador. It has passionfruit reduction within and on the plate. There’s also pop candy in the tart which gave a nice tingling feeling when you eat it. Unique and delicious. The reduction is really tart and gives a good balance to the rich dessert. Try it!Also had the Bloody Mary Cocktail with bacon. I had to order this when I learnt there was bacon with this cocktail. Everything does taste better with bacon. Now, this is a drink that you can bite, chew and drink all at the same time! Its spicy.Wine: Mchenry Hohnen Chardonnay from Margaret River, Australia: $14. The wine is light and easy to drink.I ended the meal with a double Espresso. As the restaurant are sister companies with 40 Hands, the espresso is good. Doesn’t hold a candle to Nespresso which I have in the office.No regrets dining here and we had a good time.Highly recommended
3
It was nice food, but just nothing to talk about. Our server was nice but a few things went wrong so she ended apologising quite a bit. I could see how if I'd caught them on a good day then it probably would have been much better, unfortunately I won't be rushing back any time soon.
5
We went there on an average Saturday during lunch time. The staff was freindly and the athmoshere relaxing. You can see into the kitchen and watch every step of the chefs, which I always like. It shows that thez have noting to hide. I had the Ravioli which looked beautiful but the taste was even better. It seemed as there was a new flavour every bite. After that I had to go for a dessert and it was the best decision ever. I ordered the Chocolate tarte with passionfruit and it was so rich in its taste. There were some hidden flakes that prickled in your mouth and the passionfruit sauce was surprisingly sour, which was great. It was an explosion of flavours in every bite
5
Been here many times over past few years, and I must say this year's fresh new menu is the best I have experienced. Extremely well-conceived, delightful dishes. Love the vibes in this cool resto too, which reminds me of NYC. Only thing that needs improvement is the forgetful and weak service
5
It is a very cosy (small) place that can be noisy. NIce atmosphere, open kitchen so you can watch them cook your meal. I found each dish to be quite original, you can tell they have worked on them and the result is just superb.Save some room for desserts, they are to die for 
5
Love ODP. Great service, recently renovated and lovely design. They used to have an amazing burger which I hope they bring back but the steak is also sublime. Great to sit on the bar seats and look in to the open kitchen. Go for brunch and try the french toast. Trust me
4
While the outside of this establishment may not be appealing the inside is marvelously decorated and is pleasing to the eye. When you enter you engulfed in many different aromas, which follow you to your table.I ordered the breakfast burger and it was amazing, very interesting combination of ingredients but tasted delicious. I finished it off with a glass of fresh juice. The prices are a bit steep for what quantity of food you receive but it is very good. I recommend you check it out.
4
A fine dining restaurant that serves western cuisine. Good ambience. Serves wine as well. Quite pricey - 1 entree cost around $25 to $30. Small servings similar to hotel portions.
5
Situated in the affluent Tiong Bahru neighbourhood, Open Door Policy is a n acclaimed choice for brunch.
A wonderfully distinct bill of fare delivered immaculately and moreover delectable!
5
Excellent value lunch offering. Three course plus glass of wine. Very good service and advice. Lovely interior, modern and ecclectic in the Tiong Bahru art deco district.
4
Chic and trendy, again a neo post industrial decor a bit similar to Ikyu but just fine though. Seating at the counter is THE spot for dinner. Simple, green, light Menu with an attentive service. I like.
3
Tried Open Door Policy last month. As the name suggests, the front door is always open but do make reservations first as they're quite packed for dinner time. I had the kangaroo meat and it was quite good however not for the price. My wife had the barramundi and she also thinks it's good but rather pricey

I was really excited to try this restaurant and left so dissapointed. We went for Sunday brunch. When i asked for a recommendation our waitress replied that 3 items of maybe 10 total on the brunch menu were sold out and that if we wanted to leave, she would understand. I asked again for a recommendation and she recommended all of the dishes that were sold out. Quite an odd reaction. My husband ordered a glass of wine which was miniscule, I mean clearly not what you would sell as a glass of wine. It was a bit embarrassing but we did point this out to the waiter who explained that this was their standard pour. He brought a level marked glass to the table anyway to compare and it was almost an inch below where it should have been. Im not sure if he couldnt see it from his angle but he kind of concluded that it was correct anyway. After some resistance he agreed to top it up. It was just a little embarrassing since the tables are so close and our neighbors were watching all of this go on. I ordered the smoked salmon scrambled egg sandwich which was Ok but very standard. My husband ordered a pasta dish. As soon as it arrived, we kind of looked at each other like, is this a bad joke? Are we on candid camera? The pasta dish, although tasty, was also miniscule. I imagine a bit larger than a cup of yogurt. It was not on the appetiser list. And it was 26$. Sadly, we were really dissapointed. We wouldn't go back and I don't recommend it
2
I went for lunch on a Sunday and was seated in what they call a counter seat, but would be more accurately described as a hallway seat. The constant bumping of other customers and staff against my chair made for a super unpleasant visit. Meanwhile there were loads of empty tables that never had a person at them while I was there. The food is expensive and mediocre. Don't waste your time.
4
Have been here on a few occasions for dinner with my wife and also also as a group. First of all book a table or you won't get in. Secondly you will pay a little more however it is totally worth it. Service is excellent, food is presented beautifully and the quality of the meals is excellent. Very good wine and cocktail list. You can also sit in front of the kitchen (behind glass) and eat in front of the chefs. Don't miss the dessert menu!

Had several wonderful dinning experience at OPD so made a made a reservation on last Saturday for 5. UNFORTUNATELY (exact words from the staff), I was told there was no record of the reservation when I turned up with my guests! Wondering how the reservation system works at ODP? Should I be asking for name of person who took my reservation and demand that a "written confirmation" be sent to me? Absolute snob

Made the trek out to Tiong Bahru for lunch today and opted for the set lunch at $35++. This consisted of a starter (smoked eel), a main (short rib), dessert (Creme Brûlée) and a glass of white wine. There were no alternatives but we were both very happy with the meal, although the dessert was a little sweet. In fairness I'm yet to find a restaurant in Singapore that gets Creme Brûlée right. Overall this was a great lunch and was certainly worth the effort to get here
3
We finally got to OPD. The experience was quite average. The food was nothing to write about. We ordered the haloumi salad, lamb rolls and Mains. The flavours and preparation were not unique or tasty.
3
The zircon was shivery as were the metal seats and tables. Service was quick as in the hurry up and eat variety but staff lacked charm. Food was alright but not memorable.
2
Freezing cold, noisy, ver y uncomfortable and overpriced. The good is reasonably good, excepto the desserts. Some of the prices are ridiculously expensive for no apparent reason. Justo tries toó hard to be hip, cool of whatever they attempt to be.
3
Don't get me wrong, I liked the restaurant and enjoyed my meal but I was surprised to see a couple of corners being cut which leads me to rate it as average rather than very good.I asked for a side salad and rocket was suggested, which was fine. Unfortunately though it really wasn't fresh but a wilted, sad little pile of faded greens in the bowl with a small tomato sliced on top. I really felt it was unprofessional to serve that to a customer and I sent it back. I was told that was all they had.We were also surprised to see what looked suspiciously like frozen gnocchi being taken out of bags. My husband had some as part of his main course and it was pretty chewy so I can only assume we were right and it wasn't freshly prepared. Such a shame after reading a blog review stating 'Everything is prepared with the freshest ingredients'. Having said all that, the meat and fish we ordered were freshly cooked and were tasty. Service was good
4
we ordered the seared scallops with cauliflower couscous and fresh burratina cheese for starters. love the presentation but flavours were slightly above average (but honestly it is hard to bring out flavours of scallops. and cauliflower has also flat taste). we had the wagyu burger and the bouillabaisse. the burger was decent but definitely not the best. the bouillabaisse was rich in flavours. overall it was a pretty decent experience. would i go back again? perhaps in 6 months time
5
Very modern, trendy setting with open view into the kitchen. We had a variety of main dishes from the wagyu burger to bouillabaisse to barramundi, all of which were really good. Also great cocktails, an excellent dessert wine and really friendly service. Well worth a visit
3
Return visit after 10 months. Location - great. Ambiance - things has not changed much since last visit 10 months ago. Still cool and hip, some say try too hard. But acoustics inside is horrible. It gets too loud when neighboring diners get too excited. Because the table are TOO CLOSE to each other. Lighting is acceptable. Food - great. Still as good as we remembered. Similar offers. Desserts are a must. Cocktails are limited. Good wine selection. Service - warm, friendly. But service staff should look neater and more presentable. Bartender look sloppy. Two of junior wait staff not only looked sloppy but needs to tidy up hair and clean the face. Would we come back? Not a strong drive to come back
5
We've been there for brunch and we have been happily surprise by the quality of the food from starters to dessert! We were seating at the bar and we could see them cooking it's super clean!Take the apple crumble you will not regret it!This place is not only fancy and trendy it's also about good food!Highly recommended

Had diner here yesterday. All in all I was dissapointed, especially after reading all the glowing reviews. Basically the restaurant is trying too hard to be different, which is fine, however the end result is mediocre at best. The decor is very much 'styled', lowish tables with sloping sides, the bench along the wall is too low and uncomfortable to sit on, the airconditioning is too cold (always a problem in Singapore). All of this is not so much a problem if the food is great, but it wasn't. The spicy lamb spring rolls were not really spicy, rather bland. The bouillabaisse had a lot of tofu as filler and not a lot of fish, the lamb cheek was bland, and the desserts were not great either. The wine, though pricey, was the best bit of the whole meal. All in all the dishes were trying too hard to be different, so actually the chef was trying to be different, but not succeeding.For these kinds of prices I expect better, or I go somewhere else where the taste is better. The ingridients were of a high quality, but it did not come together in great dishes
4
I've only been here for dinners. Excellent food - with the little updated touches. Like Beef cheeks, wagyu burger, beet risotto, salmon, barramundi.What seemed more special- boullabaise, pronounced excellent and tortelli with chorizo filling.So basics done very well, with imaginative & interesting sides like fried bread soaked in gazpacho, red wine quinoa.The 2 most common dining problems of Singapore in this age 1)small tables (with very curved edges, knives slipping over the edges....) oversized bowls on liners (cutting boards), large cups rather than tall glasses. 2)small premises with various hard surfaces whether glass, mirrors, wood, walls or tiles make for cosy but noisy places - never conducive to conversation among larger groups. Let's see if creativity solves these problems in the near future.....Well worth the price for the simple pleasure of good food!Great service
3
it's relatively expensive and although it's in a tourist frequented area, the staff aren't that friendly... maybe because they cater to high end market???

ODP is a great little restaurant I have no hesitation in recommending. A little on the pricy side but still good value.The menu is limited but what is on it is very tasty. I guess the best way to describe the food is western cuisine with an Asian leaning. The interior is more cosy than cramped with plenty of table space and a good sized front bar. Perhaps a little out of the way it is well worth the detour. However, here are a couple of tips. Unless you are flush with cash forget ordering wine. Wine in Singapore is hellishly expensive especially at restaurants and ODP is no exception however the beer is great and reasonably priced. The other thing is when ordering their Wagyu Burgers be careful when asking for it to be cooked medium rare because it will arrive far more on the red side. While this in no way detracts from the taste the raw appearance may be off-putting. Still, there are plenty of other delights to be found on the menu. I do recommend giving ODP a try, We will go back
4
Dinner at ODP is always a good experience. The design of the restaurant is modern and cosey. The staff is extremely friendly, very knowledgable about the food and wines. Although the place is usually busy, the staff makes you feel like a special customer.The menu is great: good quality food and great balance between fish and meat, delisciously prepared and lovely wines. Thus, this is a great restaurant for couples or groups of friends who are willing to spend about 100sgd per pax for a great evening

A trendy schoolroom feel with exercise books for menus plays host to what is probably the best British style gastro food restaurant in Singapore. It's brought to you by the same team behind the Tippling Club which has moved to tanjong pagar road, but thankfully the food prices are half as much. Now the food has always been excellent to exceptional, and I have never had just good or ok dishes here. They do soups and salads very well so if you are looking for something a bit lighter, greener and healthier this is an option worth travelling to. The set lunch represents real value for your dining buck and generally it's easier to walk in on weekdays. I'm a semi regular which for me means around 6 visits a year, and each time the food standard has remained ahead of its peers. In my mind this would definitely be on the top 50 western restaurants in Singapore list if such a thing existed
4
Food menu is hard to decide as it all looks very good . Wine list is also very good including some nice New Zealand wine . Lamb spice rolls . Beef cheeks , apple dessert with cream all excellent . Cool part of town but no bars near by
3
For starters, we had the seared scallops with cauliflower couscous, boudin noir and preserved lemon as well as the fresh burratina cheese with wagyu beef bresaola. confit cherry tomatoes and crystal bread. The presentation of the scallops dish and the flavour were both excellent but the burratina was average. For mains we had the wagyu burger with all the trimmings, garlic fries and Japanese mayonnaise and the bouillabaisse with prawns, scallops, seabass, squid and baby fennel. The burger was decent but definitely not the best I've had. The bouilabaisse was not really a bouilabaisse. It was more like seafood with a bisque poured on top. Overall the food was decent but not earth-shattering. However, we did like the service and ambiance of the restaurant
5
I've been missing American fusion restaurants and open door policy delivered 1000% on my craving. Everything we ordered was outstanding- salad, rolls, soup, risotto, burger, short ribs, and even the wine was exceptional. I don't think my review will even begin to so this place justice. We cannot wait to go back for brunch. The staff were wonderful, the entire experience was exceptional. Truly my new favorite spot in Singapor
4
I came here for lunch with some girlfriends, it was just such a super place to come. They have a really good menu and there was something for everyone. It was cooked beautifully. They had a good wine menu too. It was a tad pricey but I would rather pay a lot of money for good food than a little money for bad food, we had a really good time. The service was good too
4
The menu is imaginative. The food is flavorful and dishes are beautifully plated. Prices look reasonable, until you realize that the portions are Lilliputian. Whether he is trimming mushrooms or plating the dishes, Italian Head Chef Daniele works s-l-o-w-l-y with mindful application, as if he was meditating. Service is attentive and knowledgeable. Tiông Bahrú has turned into a bohemian, Greenwich Village-type area of Singapore, and the cool, eclectic décor at ODP makes you feel like you're in a Lower Manhattan restaurant. That impression is enhanced at lunch, when the largest proportion of customers are female westerners [(1):ODP: "Overseas Duty Policy", the corporate designation of expats at many companies)

Saturday brunch ---Fabulous cooking, excellent service ..what find....we had the salmon with scrambled eggs on ciabatta and the " burger" -- both were outstanding.. Lemon cake - individually prepared - for dessert ..plus the juice concoctions ...absolutely first rate...highly recomend. Also, a couple of doors down - a great Bookstore --- "Books Actually"
5
Hidden treasure of a restaurant in Tiong Bahru, Singapore. Great decor, quick and friendly service and really tasty food. Best warm goats cheese salad I've eaten. I will be going back
4
Loved it. Friendly service, really good food, unpretentious decor. You gorra try their crème brûlée! Cocktails a bit expensive.
5
Tiong Bahru is a little gem of a place and OPD makes it all the more special. I've lunched here twice and both times, it's been a special meal.Service is excellent and the menu is innovative. I've not had one wrong note from this restaurant and would gladly go back.Next time, Dinner
4
Maybe we hit it on an exceptional night, but I thought the food here was fantastic... Really bright flavors and beautifully prepared dishes in an unpretentious atmosphere. I'll admit; the seating is tight and the portions are a touch small for the price; but with food is this rich and flavorful you don't really want over-sized portions, and I don't mind paying a bit more when a chef has clearly put so much thought into the flavors he is combining. The staff was friendly but not overbearing. The warm coconut cake to finish was superb. This is the first meal I've had in a while, and definitely the first in this city, where I have raved over every course. Would (and will) go back in a heartbeat
4
Located in one of Singapore's hotspots, Tiong Bahru, Open Door Policy was one of the trailblazers in this area. When you first walk in, the space has promise. A buzzing crowd, plates of food passing by at breakneck speed and a frenetic open kitchen signal what potentially could be a neighborhood New York restaurant experience. Although the food was good, the portions were small, the service attentive though infrequent and the fit out looked great but the chairs and tables uncomfortable. Smoke and mirrors I'm afraid. It's still worth a look in if you are in the area and short of somewhere to go but heed this warning and avoid the dim, pungent and disturbing bathroom. Even the scent of the overused oil burner couldn't blanket the smell..
4
Know this restaurant thru radio promotion. We had Anchovies as starter, not bad and quite unique. Main course we ordered Bouillabaisse and Tortelli. The broth tasted wonderful. Cold drip coffee is their specialty. Desserts we had were pistachio souffle and creme brulee but the taste so so. Can be better. Value wise is quite expensive and the seating area is quite squeezy. The waitress is knowledgeable with the menu and friendly. Good try
2
We had heard great reviews that were not delivered for our Brunch. Awesome seats overlooking the kitchen but then our coffee was cold & horribly bitter (when they finally arrived). $32 burger was only ok (again cold) & my scrabbled eggs soggy & dull, partially saved by the great wild mushrooms. Brunch for 2, with 1 coffee each = $102 = terrible valueIt's a shame as you can see the potential
4
We shared a dozen of oysters ($64) with Asian slaw and black vinegar dressing. They were fresh but not chilled enough, the slaw was rather overpowering (way too much of it) and the vinegar masked the oyster flavor rather than enhance it. Serving the dressing and slaw on the side would have made it much better. I want to taste the oysters! It would have been nice to know what kind they were and where they came from. We also shared a burratina (fresh cheese, so creamy!) appetizer, which was served with wagyu bresaola (fab) on fried bread (greasy). I wish there was more burratina.Yes, the beef cheek is THAT addictive; I just had to have it again. Still melt-in-my-mouth good (if a little undersalted), now it comes with red wine quinoa and beetroot puree. The colors are rather monochromatic, but the flavors aren't: the beetroot was bright and refreshing, quinoa done perfectly and seasoned well.The Iberico pork belly was amazingly fatty and juicy, and seasoned perfectly. The color combination (with sweet potato gnocchi) was just so strikingly pretty.The portions were smaller than I remembered from previous visits, so we shared a bowl of chips ($10) on the side. They were hot, crispy, fluffy on the inside, but a little undersalted.The souffle is still as fluffy and hot and chocolatey as before, one of my favorite desserts in town.The bottle of white wine we had was probably the cheapest on their list (at $66) and it showed. Very pricey for what it is; I won't order wine here again.The bill came to $325 for two. This place is veering towards overpriced
3
Went here for mains on a Monday and had a nice meal, but overpriced for the level of food. The staff are friendly however the place was freezing, I asked to turn off the air conditioning unit which was causing a draft on my back which they did, but 10 minutes on and another one right above head was turned on. Won't be going back due to the coldness
5
Had lamb spring rolls, burrata salad, scallops and black pudding, chorizo tortellini, brûlée and frozen mandarin sabayon.Scallops were our least favorite, bit to garlicky and slightly overdone, but the rest was excellent, spring rolls loaded with flavour and nice fresh components to balance it just nice. Homemade chorizo was very very good, great textures, Standout was the brûlée best I've ever eaten!Service was good but def lacking in areas
3
A nice little bistro in a relatively quiet neighborhood. It has an inviting interior with a small bar counter; nicely designed dining area in a covered ALLEY between buildings with mix-and-match chairs and tables; simple but almost elegant setting with a relaxing ambience. The "roof" for the alley is composed of glass panels, that gives almost an open-air feel. Three of us went there for a nice lunch. We had (see pics):(1) appetizer "Halloumi cheese plate", s$19, EXCELLENT; (2) entrée, "Barramundi with artichoks and spinach", $28, NOT BAD, good texture, subtle taste;(3) entrée, "Short Ribs", s$32, super tasty and tender; (4), entrée "Duck Ragou", s$25, a bit too bland and dry;(5) Dessert, "Apple crumble", s$15, hot, not too sweet, lots of apple, simply delicious! In short, it offers tasty dishes, though they are small in quanty, and on the EXPENSIVE side. The wait staff is quite attentive, though not too friendly. The place has a comfortable interior and relaxing ambience. Reservation is recommended. Oh yes, its bathroom is UNISEX; a bit too dark; and has a rustic WOODEN SLIDING DOOR!Feb 201

I've been to ODP 2x - food overall is decent with a few standouts. Squid ink risotto on first visit was quite good and the I thought the burger my fiance had on the 2nd visit was excellent. Also the pineapple cake was a winner. Service was friendly, although I felt I was being upsold during the first visit. Ambience is good, but acoustics are not great, so quite loud. We just moved down the street, so I'm sure we'll be back, but I hope next time to have better luck overall
4
I was so impressed with the design of the space. It looked fresh, yet also retro. It looked like it just came from Williamsburg Brooklyn. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The food was fusion of Asian and contemporary cooking. There was a lot of attention to little details such as special flower buds on the meals. The soups were incredible. Everything here was incredible. This was our second favorite spot to dine on our entire trip. I would definitely go back to this restaurant. Great for a date, business outing and for family gathering
5
We love love love ODP. It's small and popular, so reservations on most nights are definitely in order.One of the best places to sit is at the kitchen high top. The kitchen sits behind glass, but you can sit and watch all of the food being prepared.Everything was great here, including desserts. Nothing is made until ordered, so it's super fresh.Drinks here were great. The Orchard Fizz was one of our favorites.Service here was excellent and very friendly. Overall, this is one of our favorite places in Singapore
5
We showed up for brunch and started with a glass of sparkling rose. We looked at the menu and stopped at the option of the chef feeding us his choice. I have to say that I was blown away at the variety of food that came our way. Super fun atmosphere and interesting people walking around to cool music. Great neighborhood with boutique shops & bookstores. Definitely go for brunch and let them feed you...but they also have a burger that looked amazing as wel
4
Top pick is their burgers! Also, if you are like me where I am fine with just about anything. Choose their "FEED ME" option, where the chef makes the selection for you.Chocolate martini is a MUST!For dessert, try the apple crumble.Make sure to book tables when Ben is working the front! Really cares for the diner's experience
5
We went to Phuket and Singapore for a holiday and ODP was the standout. The service in-particular a cut above the rest. The menu was considerably smaller than many other places we had experienced along the way, but the food was amazing. Compliments to the chef for focusing on a smaller scope of culinary dishes. We had the coffee cured ocean trout and jamon entrees which were both outstanding. The main courses we tried were the beef cheek, striploin steak, barramundi and quail saltimbocca. All were cooked magnificently, flavour combinations were great and the presentaion neat and tidy. Great to see a wine list that wasnt one dimensional and allowed multiple wines by the glass. Desserts were a great end to the night. One of the best apple crumbles ive ever had, caramel creme brulee, mango souffle and coconut/pineapple cake all hit the spot and were complimented by great coffee. Yes I said it, Great Coffee in Asia. No more starbucks rubbish. Our first espresso coffee from a Synesso machine! (exciting for us Australian coffee snobs)Staff were friendly and communicated very well with us. I would love to go back!!!
2
We were really keen to go, but odp disappointed...Nice interior in the coolest street odd Singapore didn't deliver on food.First the portions were small. I ordered beef cheeks. It was one with no sides. Came in luke warn. Second the prices were highThird the options were to limited. No cheeses for desert and just one standard draft beer.Not delivering
5
this restaurant has very good food and service and the interior is very cool and nice atmosphere to eat in. unique and well done place. duck pasta was great, burger cooked to order was pink and juicy (mediut m) as requested! prices are a little bit high i think, but its not too far off. will go again some day
1
We reserved a table for dinner through the Manager,Ben.I was told seats by the bar counter are only for walk in customers but tables can be reserved.As we arrived, we were greeted (no smiles) by a waiting staff and Ben,(smile totally absent too) and was shown to a table ,I asked him if was the person I has spoken with earlier and again with little enthusiasm,answered yes.He proceded to place two menus on the table and was about to leave(mind you he made no effort to pull my chair out but plopped the two menus down)As the bar counter had two available seats,I asked if we could be seated there..He said yes,again just placed two menus on the counter and made no effort to pull out my seat.(shouldn't it be an instant move)Was he trained in the service industry?He sets a very bad example with his staff,theyl looked so unhappy and solemn the entire evening.The manager ought to set the mood,if you are uptight.the staff too gets nervous..The saving grace was perhaps the food,small portions but shall remember to order two mains in the future and The Chinese Head Chef that came and spoke with us.I understand all his junior chefs have been trained by the best culinary schools here.And a new foreign chef will arrive soon.You may have the best chefs but if your front of house staff under performs,its ruins the entire dining experience. There was no comment page on the website..

To secure a reservation you have to provide credit card details of not they charge your card for no show. Thanks but this will be my first and last visit.
4
This is my second review on ODP - and its just as good as the first one. This time for Sunday Brunch. The menu itself was 'small', but had a good selection of different flavours and textures to choose from. It was the first time I have had Eggs Benedict with an Indian influence, very creative and tasty. The coffee was strong and full in body in flavour. The service quick, attentive and friendly. My only concern was one of the diners wanted to change the egg order (from Scrambled to a poached) and this was not accommodated, therefore be prepared to only order as it comes & special requests or dietary requirements are not attended too. However, we still had a good meal, in a nice restaurant with great, urban atmosphere
4
Dinner on a Monday night can be a bit hit and miss, but not at Open Door Policy. It was a hit. We ordered dishes to share across three courses, and stands like the watercress soup, duck pasta with smoky sauce, warm haloumi salad, and pork belly were standouts.Dessert included a super apple crumble, an okay creme brulee, but the hands down winner were the Madeleines, some of the best I've ever had.We ordered an organic, no preservative white wine, the second of which was very good
4
We came here 2 times :)1st as a couple for a romantic dinner and 2nd with our colleagues for our corporate lunch, both occasion are very good!!! We trusted their feed me policy menu since we had unique meal experiences they gave us + open-glass kitchen added an extra unique atmosphere which is very rare I saw in Singapore, especially for a middle-high class of restaurant, their staff are friendly although they are not trained enough to handle an input Overall, it's a good restaurant for any ocassion you want to gone through, romance, business, family, friends, etc & my mouth is drool now just to remember the taste of their 48 hour braised beef cheek with mochi potatoes, carrot puree & pea tendrils :
1
This is my third time there, and I have yet to have one good meal there. Various friends keeps suggesting this place and I want to give this place a chance and not just judge from the first time. The death knell for me was ordering a $28 brunch dish only to get an overcooked, rubbery disk of an excuse of an sunny side up egg. I sent it back only to get back another rubbery, COLD sunny side up egg. Where is quality control in this restaurant?!?!?! I have complained to the wait staff each time I have been here, for either over salted, cold and unpalatable, and all I get is "thanks for the feedback."This place is overrated, overpriced and the food is sad at best. Well intentioned, but the execution is atrocious. There are so many great, great places to go in the area, but save your time and money and not go here
3
Its a small resto bar tuck in the Yong Siak Street, where you have rows of quaint shops of bookstore,nik naks and cute gift shops. The name is of the resto is very unique. We started with some cocktails i think its called "bellini" that i really liked but a bit pricey $S19. We choose an item called "Feed Me" which we had the chef decide what to served us this is at $S47 each for 2 course menu. The starters were "tuna tartar serve on prawn crackers" this i really like and a halloumi cheese with olives and crusty bread this i did not like so much. For main course the we had the barrumudi fish and braised beef cheek. The fish i like but the beef was just average. Flavors not enough enticing for me to go back. Servers were filipino so i they are very friendly with fellow filipino. Our final bill was $200 which i felt was a bit overrated. I think the feed me option is not really worth that well for the food you are getting. This are like in-room dining food that you will get in a hotel... ops sorry for this but that is just how i felt about the dish
3
Interesting woody decor and the first thing i realised was how cold the air-conditioning wasNone of the starters interested me and i saw what my friends ordered and felt validated. The caesar salad looked pedestrian. The thai chicken broth with meatballs is a total rip-off at $15-20 when you get it in bangkok for $1. The scallop dish had 2 tiny scallopsHad a tough time with the mains too, nothing looked exciting. Opted for the kingfish with clams. It was an interesting combo and tasted ok. My friends had the braised ribs and mentioned how tender they were. Another had the pork belly and it looked averageWe decided to go elsewhere for dessert as we weren't impressed with the dessert menu eitherMy friends ordered glasses of wine and after we settled the bill, my friend checked it and realised they charged a bottle instead of 1 glass. It may have been an innocent mistake, but annoying neverthelessAnd oh, because the aircon was so damn freezing, i got home and got the fl

I have been to ODP a few times. Last Friday I joined two girlfriends for dinner. We had a main each, starter to share and three desserts. The mains ( barramundi and chicken) were extremely disappointing. I was starving after the barramundi- it was about four pieces of fish but nothing else maybe one beautifully cut carrot!!My friends chicken was dry and very inspiring. To remedy our disappointment and satisfy our hunger- we each ordered dessert to share. Lets just say if we were on master chef we would be going home! SoufflÃ© was basically only egg whites- not tasty. Trifle - they need a visit to grandmas kitchen to learn how to make this. The crumble was passable. The wine was good. Thank goodness. There was something. It was such a disappointing meal. I would urge you not to eat here ever. Very overrated and over priced! Never again and I live in the neighborhood.
5
Visitors to Singapore really should head to ODP for brunch or lunch.The venue has a great vibe and the staff are excellent. It was the perfect start to the day; followed by F1 and RiRi.Very highly recommended. A must do resto.Menu suggestion: the chicken wings (starter) are amazing.S

Open Door Policy is another one of those places you hear a lot of people talk about and want to see what the fuss is about. And there is a lot of fuss.Located at the Tiong Bahru Neighbourhood, this seems like an odd match. The food is average I would say, but atmosphere is very appealing.Tried the 48hr braised beef cheek, tender but slightly gamey in taste. Roasted chicken was rubbery in texture.Apple crumble was very nicely baked though, crusty and fragrant vanilla custard on top.The entire experience and more photos can be read at my blog:http://sethlui.com/food-review-open-door-policy

Located in an old neighborhood of Tiong Bahru, Open Door Policy (ODP) serves smart-tasty meals from breakfast, brunch to dinner, and they've got good coffee, too. The decor of the place is very trendy with industrial chic style. Don't miss while staying in Singapore!
3
It was nice to sit by the counter watching the cooks preparing, plating etc the food. We were kinda guessing what's the ingredients, the dish and enjoyed watching them prep food.Ambience was OK. Went in with no reservations. Was told that its going to be a full house by the 90 minutes we were there, the tables remained empty. I guess it's hard and they don't expect guest to cancel or even turn up on time. My friend had the beef steak while I had to go for colour - beet root risotto. Food was ok with very good host/waiters. We were recommended the deconstructed black forest cake. I would prefer the cake in its form and not deconstructed - call me old school...will I be back? Na

We were celebrating a friend's birthday and she wanted to go to the Open Door Policy (OPD) since she had heard many good things about it from friends and colleagues. We were not disappointed in fact we were amazed by the level of attention we received from the wait-staff. We are the kind of people who love to order many dishes and share. We mentioned that in passing to our waitress and when the soup arrived she automatically brought some smaller empty bowls to us to make sharing easier. Even the strip lion we ordered came pre-sliced for easy sharing. WELL DONE! That level of service is exceptional in my books. The food was tasty and reasonably priced. Nice wine list. Make sure you leave room for dessert
4
The food and atmosphere at this small restaurant are great. You always need a reservation unless you come early and manage to get a bar seat. The food was delicious but portions are small. Either you should try to opt for the sharing dishes or really aim for 3 courses. So it is not cheap but really a nice food experience. I think prices could adjust a little to the portion sizes but otherwise worth a visit.
4
My dirst visit with my food, we like their soup~ so yummy. Beef is great too but just abit salty. some female waitess need more training not so pro in recommend food or wines. Male - senior waiter is great with his PR :)Like the decor of ODP with wood and glass roof..i like!Wish i did try their dessert too but wasn't feeling well

Open Door Policy is located on the chic Yong Siak Street at Tiong Bahru, bang opposite the Forty Hands Café… Classily decorated in a mixture of rustic and wood… the place is endowed with some old style bare brick walls and… a glass roof! You can see right through the ceiling. I am sure it must be amazing to sit beneath that roof when it is raining! The first thing you see when you enter is an immaculately designed bar, and a glass-walled kitchen! In fact there are some bar stools outside the kitchen, allowing cooking enthusiasts to sit there and enjoy the chefs at work!Moving to food… ODP has a decently extensive and creative ala carte menu. That’s no surprise, because the menu is written and overseen by Executive Chef Ryan Clift of the Tipping Club (ranked Asia’s 10th best restaurant in the 2011 Miele Guide) fame. Their menu is available on their website… however, going back to the beginning of this post, this time, at ODP we left the decision about what we eat with the chef… this is how.The first line in their menu has something called “Feed us” sharing menu.

And all four of us were in for a treat:[1] Open Door Policy – Feed Us!Asia, Asian, Food Review, Restaurant, Restaurant Review, Singapore, Vegetarian August 14, 2013 Leave a commentOpen Door PolicyI am not a lazy eater… let me rephrase that. I am not a lazy food chooser. I love reading menu’s, descriptions of dishes and then making my choice… However, once in a while… I like to be surprised. I like not knowing what I am going to eat. Once in a while, I like surfing through the menu, but leaving the choice to someone else… And if that someone else is the chef himself… well, it cannot get any better.That’s exactly what happened a couple of Sunday’s back. It was a lazy Sunday evening when I pinged a friend asking her about their evening plan. She promptly replied, “We are going to ODP for dinner. Wanna join?” Intrigued, “ODP?” I pinged back. “Oh, sorry, Open Door Policy… It’s a restaurant near Tiong Bahru… quite a favourite with us.” Well who doesn’t want to try out something new, especially if it happens to be someone’s favourite eatery!DSC_0900 - CopyOpen Door PolicyOpen Door Policy is located on the chic Yong Siak Street at Tiong Bahru, bang opposite the Forty Hands Café… Classily decorated in a mixture of rustic and wood… the place is endowed with some old style bare brick walls and… a glass roof! You can see right through the ceiling. I am sure it must be amazing to sit beneath that roof when it is raining! The first thing you see when you enter is an immaculately designed bar, and a glass-walled kitchen! In fact there are some bar stools outside the kitchen, allowing cooking enthusiasts to sit there and enjoy the chefs at work!Moving to food… ODP has a decently extensive and creative ala carte menu. That’s no surprise, because the menu is written and overseen by Executive Chef Ryan Clift of the Tipping Club (ranked Asia’s 10th best restaurant in the 2011 Miele Guide) fame. Their menu is available on their website… however, going back to the beginning of this post, this time, at ODP we left the decision about what we eat with the chef… this is how.The first line in their menu has something called “Feed us” sharing menu. It says “can’t decide and prefer to share? simply ask your waiter to ‘FEED US’ as we roll out a selection of delicious dishes for $47++ per head or add desserts for $59++ per head.

My local friend brought me to this place on a non busy weekday. Loved the trendy decor and settings. The food was good, fusion and lot of complimentary elements. A bit let down by the chocolate souffle though, too much separated butter at the bottom. Overall it was a good meal, and the serving was an appropriate size. I would love to come back to try their weekend brunch next time I'm in Singapore

OPD tucked in the up n coming area near Tiong Bahru MRT . Simple layout with bar and kitchen stretching the whole length to the right....tables all the way down the left. Staff on the night were very polite and efficient. Reasonable selection of wine. On a good night the place has a nice ambience.Food is good. But I have to say I think it is rather expensive for the portion size... which for me seemed incredibly small ! Plus with the food choices it's not going to appeal to all customers. For me this is one of those places I have been to and would most probably only return if suggested.
2
I attended ODP with a group of 8 friends for brunch, most of us ordered the Croque Monsieur. At $24 per serve +VAT + Service fee... we expected a substantial meal. What arrived was pathetic, it was a small sandwich with a small peace of ham and unmelted cheese inside - nothing else. It was pathetic for the money paid. The waited also to great care to tell us that we would not be able to ask for a refill of our tea pot... strange...Not going back
4
Have eaten here several times for both lunch and dinner and the food has been consistently good. Well executed and tasty. Have found service always helpful too.Decor quite urban and it can get a tad noisy when restaurant is full, but that's all part of the fun.Enjoy
3
The place is quite good, food are ok but not the best, I think is overprice and the waiting staff is very fussy. Won't come back!
4
We went there last night and had a wonderful time. It was our first visit but already we are planning to go back for more! So glad to discover ODP. :)Recommended:For starters, our roasted quail was tender and moist, and we loved the Caesar salad.... simply delicious!Hubby had the beef cheek for his main and it is a MUST TRY! Melt-in-your-mouth lovely!Our chocolate pistachio soufflé and apple crumble provided a sweet ending to a wonderful meal.Pass:I was disappointed with my lamb cutlet. It tasted alright but a bit too fatty for me. Could have used a proper meat knife, too, as had a bit of difficulty sawing through the tendon.The plate for the cutlet was not appropriate as it was more of a wide bowl and added to the difficulty of cutting into my meat when everything kept coming together at the base in the middle.Just something to think about for improvement.Kudos:The staff were great! Special thanks to Elaine & Will. It was the end of a long working day but having them around just perked us right up! Their enthusiasm and attentiveness were the perfect foil for a lovely celebratory evening. And our dessert came with a little extra touch since I mentioned in my reservation that we'd be celebrating my husband's birthday.All in all, a perfect intimate dinner that made a lasting impression

A friend invited us to eat with him at the Open Door. They'd had it recommended to them. Interesting location (and be careful if you park - the red bays are for the local HDB residents - pick a yellow bay) and a very interesting resurant. With the glass roof and brick work, it makes it feel like you're in a covered alley way.The menu was varied enough and the food OK, but nothing that would make us rush back. Between us we had: Carrot salad, four bean bruchetta and tuna carpaccio followed by beef cheek, kinsfish and duck ragout. Reasonable sized portions. We certainly didn't walk away hungry as none of us could manage a dessert.Wine was a lot more varied than many other restuarants but a little on the pricey side (for Singapore).Service was good and there was no issue about '1 order per customer'. We were offered menus to select dessert and coffees.Do book - it does get busy especially on a Friday night (which is when we went)
3
The food here is really excellent. Unfortunately, the service provided by the staff at OPD made my dining experience highly unpleasant. They have a '1 order per patron' rule here; which is fine, but I would have appreciated an effort to inform me of this up front instead of mentioning only when they took our order. Not only did this misinformation cause us to order more than what we needed, it also brought great displeasure and inconvenience as a friend in our group had to actually step out of the bistro just because there are lesser orders than there are people. We had to rush through our meal to join her again outside. It didn't help when the waitress literally chucked our receipt and change at us upon our departure.Basically, I didn't feel welcome at all and it seemed like the staff couldn't wait for us to leave. I wouldn't frequent this place agai

Had a superb dinner here with my partner at this trendy little restaurant close to Tiong Bahru MRT station. It's a strange location in amongst high-rise HDB blocks but once inside you'd never believe it. The atmosphere is really lively and service from the staff was very attentive, friendly and helpful. The tuna tartare was excellent as was the strip loin steak which was cooked to perfection. Prices are reasonable, though the bottle of wine was a little pricey at about $85. Having said that it was an excellent Cabernet Sauvignon.This is the second time we tried to eat here (the first time they were full, and both times were on a weeknight) so it does get very busy and I would recommend booking. Hard to fault and we will definitely be back

This place is excellent by Singaporean standards - I mean that there are just not that many funky, cool restaurants in this city. P.S Cafe used to be just about the only one, and there is still little competition - although the recent appearance of trendy, smart places like ODP is changing things for the better. What you get here is a stylish cubby hole situated on a street with other quirky coffee, food and retail outlets - in a neighbourhood of grotty run-down Housing Development Board flats (referred to as charming, but really just plain ugly). This area around Tiong Bahru is an up and coming trendy zone, but it's hard to see why - there's nothing very appealing about the area at all; aside from the Forty Hands coffee shop, and the Foodie Marketplace (for organic Aussie and U.S meat at crazy cheap wholesale prices).Anyway, ODP has a deliberately distressed old school classroom / factory vibe, jazz music and a buzzy atmosphere. The service is typically unassuming and informal - but competent, and the food is fabulous (what did you expect from the owners of the Tippling Club?), although the portions are on the small side as other reviewers have noted. We had the Broccoli and Stilton Soup, Caesar Salad, and Beef Cheeks x2 - and all were outstanding. Deep rich flavours, great presentation and little twists on traditional combinations made for an excellent lunch - the third we've had here.I don't drink booze at lunchtime, so our bill was a comparatively modest $130 but I did notice that the drinks prices were steep - as is the food frankly. It's all definitely on the higher side for Singapore, but that's the premium you pay for premium...For post-lunch coffee go across the road to Forty Hands, which is hands-down the finest coffee in town - although $13.70 for 2 double macchiatos is steep. But you'll be used to that by now..

ODP is a trendy eatery in up and coming Tanjong Pagar a block back from the Singapore River, but a whole different ambiance from the serviced apartments and hotels close by. It's a quiet residential district with low rise 1950s white washed apartments all around. Inside there's a bustle, relatively loud music and a huge amount of energy. ODP is funky. You see this in the chairs which are are different and mismatched, in the weathered and worn wooden floor boards which are deliberately aged and distressed, whilst the lamps and lighting scream shabby chic. The staff are chippy Filipinas with very switched on attitude, who barely feel the need to write down your orders. The kitchen is glassed in and visible to all. Watching slightly drunk punters tackle the sliding doors into the bathroom provides hours of amusement to anyone seated nearby and sober.The wine list is extensive and varied with Hungarian and Portuguese reds among the usual French and Italian. A bottle begins at $78 for house red and the food is not cheap either. A bowl of soup will set you back $15 (broccolli and stilton, watercress and poached egg; main courses touch $30 and desserts are all double digit as well. The warm broccolli and goat's cheese salad was excellent, and very tangy and tasty, whilst the duck with pappardelle pasta and smoked tomato sauce was delicious, but a little lacking in portion size. Don't expect a bread basket. The Black Forest cake mousse made up for the miserly portions, though, and was the pick of the dessert crop. My wife had the poached peaches with pistachio ice cream - tasty, but paucous. Two courses each and two bottles of wine between six people with a lot of sparkling water came in just shy of $100 per head. I'd come back because the food is good and the place has life

Always crowded in this 70-seater restaurant, so if the weekend, must book. Ambience is modern & chic, the positive energy infectious, food is heavenly, waitstaff knowledgeable & friendly. We were there in a party of 6, all were game for its New concept of Sharing. So 6 different appetizers, 6 mains, 6 desserts to share! So it's a 12-course degustation at SGD 59! Please try the mussels, scallops, monkfish & short ribs
3
This is a trendy Bistro style restaurant with a wide choice of popular dishes, steaks, fish, mussels are all there.The food is well presented and quality but the serves are small by Australian [and USA ] standards.Wine is over the top expensive, as is most of Singapore, but $109 SIN for a very average bottle of Italian red is expensive by any standard.Service was good, waiters were attentive, but you can get better valueWe had the mussels, fish ,beef cheeks and Pasta for mains and all were quality, but you need an appetizer and maybe, a dessert if you a have an average appetit

I went to ODP for brunch with my friends a couple of weeks ago, i ordered salmon with toast, i dont remember whats the name of my menu but its quite nice.the thing i love about ODP is the interior, they are using unique theme for their restaurant.i really like it, and i also tried their dessert which was soufflé, and its unique and of course it taste good ! i am sure, i'll be back to tried another menu 
5
Love it. We go often, mostly for lunch on Saturdays. The soups are great. The staff are great. The salads are great. The desserts are great. The slow drip coffee is great. Everything is great!
Ensure you book - it's very popular.
5
Visited this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend..... very quirky little street set the atmosphere. Delicious, interesting food, good prices and great service. Will be back!

This restaurant is fantastic.
Fabulous food and excellent, informative, friendly staff.
Vibrant atmosphere.
Quirky interiors / seating.
Definitely recommend.
For drinks before dinner visit the Social Haus bar a few doors up. The service is fantastic and friendly.
5
The restaurant is in a really cool up and coming neighbourhood called Tiong Bahru and the restaurant reflects the feel and positivity that permeates the area. The decor is kind of semi-industrial with a view into the glassed off kitchen. The service is excellent and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Everything we ate was terrific but the beef cheek rates a special mention. It was melt in your mouth tender and bursting with flavour. The wine list is good and very well priced. I haven't seen a restaurant of this quality in this price bracket before. A really excellent experience overall
4
Amidst the new happening hotspot of Tiong Bahru, OPD's minimalist decor enhances the fuss free delicious menu. Four bean bruschetta was a mouthwatering start, enhanced by fresh pea and mint purÃ©e. Starters of jerusalem artichoke and truffle soup; duck crisply fried in papadum coating,steak were quick to arrive, and nicely presented. Mains of sea bream and beef cheek were equally well received. the wine list isn't very extensive but you can take your own for a $30 per bottle crack age charge. Staff were friendly, helpful and engaging. Diners can choose to sit at a table or at the bar surrounding the glass screened kitchen where the dishes are created. This is a popular place so be sure to book. Keep away from he back tables if you can which are directly outside the toilets, screened only by a sliding door

Who said school is boring? Not when it's combined with an eatery serving up culinary delights and entertainment provided by the creative back-to-schools decor. If you're with a new partner or on a first date, this is the place to go because you'll definitely not want for ice-breakers! Mine started testing me on my knowledge of the symbols in the Periodic Table. But don't let the decor carry you away however, the food is top notch - good variety, generous amounts (possibly too generous in some cases such as the delicious lamb I ordered) and well priced by Singapore standards. There is a sizeable wine list, a nice choice of starters and although the kitchen and its activity is visible to diners, it is not intrusive.The tables are in fact school desks and seating is by way of a whole range of chairs from armchairs to secretarial chairs to swivel forms and good old school chairs. Yes, some are not particularly comfortable but there is a lot to distract one from this inconvenience. Agreat experience and definitely worth a look-in when next in Singapore
4
If you are looking for a brunch date destination with your other half you have to check this place out. It's a little out of the way but on a very cool street, be careful to spot the entrance! We had soup starters, a risotto and flat bread style pizza loaded with lamb for mains and then got tempted by the puddings... We sat at the bar counter looking into the kitchen where the 4 chefs run around doing their thing. As a foodie this is defiantly what made the meal as I couldPick up tips for my own use :) seeing the chef create a chocolate and pistachio cake before my eyes for another dinner was more temptation than I could handle! You can't book the kitchen window seats in advance as they are on a first come first serve basis. I highly recommend calling to book in advance as when ever we have been its been completely full- and I know why!
4
It's located in a quite nook at Tiong Bahru. Most noticeable things are a chic setting, constant him of people chatting, amazing choice of music and a hand picked staff. They know about the place, their guests and the philosophy behind the restaurant - to serve a pleasant experience.
4
We visited on Christmas eve and had two hours before the second seating but did not feel rushed in any way. The service is efficient and friendly, the only distraction was the frigid air-con at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant. Once we moved to the bar to finish our drinks, it was more pleasant. There is a good selection of food and wine, with reasonable prices for Singapore. Definitely worth a return visit
5
The first time I went, I had the beef cheeks, and I feel in love with it so hard. I've been there several times after that, and I always order the same thing. Friends ordered other items, and I pilfered some from their plates--good, but not as good as the beef cheeks.The crispy chicken wing with curryfoam is also really good, paired with a refreshingly minty cucumber salad.For dessert, the pistachio chocolate souffle never disappoints
5
A lovely trendy restaurant reminiscent in a lovely street in Tiong Bahru. The fairly simple yet well cooked food is delicious and the waiters and waitresses are all very good - friendly and efficient (a nice change for Singapore).
4
ODP is a swinging bistro/coffee shop with some interesting dishes, top service and an appealing atmosphere. If you are in town for a day or two don't bother but for something a bit different it is worth a visit.
3
I had great expectations for this little restaurant. The fit out is odd and the room was extremely loud. Great area though if you go when the quaint little shops surrounding are open. We had our meals which were tasty but not "OMG, i need to plan when i am coming back here again". I had the anchovie and haloumi salad and pumpkin soup which were good but not great. The wine selection was a bit limited, and as people have mentioned the food and the wine a little on the pricey side
4
I've been to ODP a couple of times now, and the food has always been exceptional if pricey. It is a contemporary restaurant of superb quality. It is located in Tiong Bahru, an inner city suburb of Singapore which used to be home to the European quarter with lots of art deco buildings, so a stroll after dinner around the neighbourhood is well worth it. ODP is run by the same people who brought us 40 Hands which is on the opposite side of the street - both serve some of the best coffee in Singapore. I'd recommend booking a table as it is quite popular
4
Hidden away in one of the small corners of Singapore the restaurant is very stylish and the food was not too bad! I had the roasted lamb shanks and my colleagues the risottos which were really good! But it was quite pricey though..Our total bill was $169 for 6 pax
3
I leapt at the chance when a friend suggested we have brunch there. Perhaps it's because Open Door Policy has a dining area that stretches the length of this Tiong Bahru shophouse but sound does seem to be amplified greatly here. Best to look elsewhere if you want a quiet meal with the significant other, as it's more akin to dining in a railway station here with noise levels to match. Recognized the host from another restaurant so his greeting was warm & sincere. Waiter service was average but the staff were friendly enough. Shared the scrambled eggs on brioche & the ricotta pancakes, which was just right for the two of us. Coffee was strong, just what you'd expect since the team behind 40 Hands across the street was responsible for the joe. I love the neighborhood but what we ate wasn't reason for us to return for brunch. I had eaten lunch previously & while the food was above average, I expected more since Ryan Cliff from the Tippling Club has consulted on the menu
3
We were there on a week day afternoon for lunch and despite being there not being too much of a crowd, we were greeted somewhat testily when we said we had no reservation and didn't mind being seated at the back of the restaurant. This turned out to be the best for us as not only was it pleasantly brighter than the front part of the restaurant, we also had a lot more privacy and didn't need to rub elbows with our fellow diners. Sad it is that due to space constraints or high rentals, SO many restaurants in Singapore tend to place diners at less and an elbow's length away! Aside from one waitress who was friendly and welcoming, the service was just brisk and unsmiling. Our orders were prepared well and the portion sizes sufficient for us, the beef cheek was tender and the pan-friend salmon was done just right. However both were decidedly average in the way they were seasoned. There wasn't much flexibility when we asked for substitute for a side but that didn't bother us much. Overall, the food was prepared well, the prices were reasonable and the presentation was fair. ODP is one of those places for a week day lunch if you're in the neighbourhood but not sufficiently memorable to warrant a special trip
4
A favorite. Very good, fresh food. Go for brunch, lunch or dinner. Good value wine list. Loves: all brunch items (really); watercress soup; artichoke veloutÃ©; bruschetta w beans and mint pesto; beef cheeks; roast salmon w panzanella; risotto; We have liked essentially everything we have had. Good bet for vegetarians too. Only thing we have that we didn't care for was the Caesar salad dressing -- the salad was lovely but the dressing wasn't Caeasar or that tasty anyway. Only regret is that I'm always too full for dessert, though they look lovely. Service is v good. Small. On Yong Siak street which has Forty Hands coffee, Books Actually, a new Japanese place and more.
2
Staff - friendly and helpfulService - rushed - taking empty plates away whilst other party still eatingFood portion - smallFish and Risotto overcooked, Beef Tartar smothered in sauce, Tuna Carpaccio - more decor that Tuna. Dessert has to be ordered whilst on the main - or wait for 20 min. Wine selection ok l
5
I eat in Open Door Policy twice when visiting Singapore on business and staying at the nearby Wangz hotel. On both occasions I sat at the bar looking into the open kitchen. The service was friendly, efficient and very quick; the food good and fresh; and there is a good winelist (and a deal, which I perhaps foolishly didn't partake of, whereby if you order a bottle and do not finish it they will vaccum seal it for a week and give you 20% off your next bill when you return). The prices are pretty good - around 80 SD for two courses and two glasses of wine
4
Love the ambience.. services are pretty good too. The open concept kitchen is great, but need to give more space between the bar table and other dining table. Overall, I'm very satisfied :), only one thing that it's quite pricey!
2
Had lunch there yesterday.Great bloody mary.Interesting menu however over use of truffle oil!When I requested a truffle free steak tartare I was told that without the truffle it would ruin a perfect dish. Not sure whether the Chef has actually tasted a real tartare.Tried to order 2 different bottles of Chardonnay - out of stock! Seriously don't offer list with out of stock items!Lastly a companion requested poached eggs however the chefs response was "all the eggs have been prepared". Only scrambled available, again seriously!! Not sure whether the Chef is just arrogant or incapable!Waitress - brilliant, she needs to get a job at a decent restaurant

I had dinner at ODP last Friday with a group of 6.Walking past a number of times on weekends it had been impossible to walk-in and get lunch/dinner so bookings are definitely required. Funny given the namesake of the restaurant, but good for them if they're busy.Our group were all excited to attend given a preview of the menu looked exciting and we anticipated a great dining experience in Tiong Bahru.Unfortunately the verdict, in a word, disappointment. Decor, bright lights and good service are an expectation for me, so it's the food that determines if a restaurant has my repeat business and endorsement. I'm not one to write reviews, but my disappointment on this restaurant and the food there warranted me to put a warning out there to potential diners. If you are looking for gourmet Singapore, look elsewhere. For a restaurant in this price tier I expect them to deliver the goods. Not so.For those who like a blow by blow run-down, sorry, but as a group of 6 each taking three courses, as a table we tried most of everything across the menu. Entrees, which are usually a great teaser for the evening were a let down, which I guess was an accurate taster for the mains and through to desserts. Undercooked, overcooked, dry and bland, 'uninteresting', 'boring' and 'is this what I ordered?' were the main discussions around the table. Execution on all counts were always not quite right.A true test of a good restaurant is capturing a happy satisfied customer with repeat business and positive word of mouth. ODP, you've lost this group of customers
4
Refreshing addition to Singapore dining scene, for brunch or dinner. Lovely fresh produce shines in most dishes. We love: for brunch, the smoked salmon and eggs, the scrambled eggs w asparagus and truffle; for dinner, the artichoke soup (really tasty), the warm spinach, pea shoot and broccoli salad w goat cheese and pine nuts (simple yet delicious), any of the fish dishes, the risotti. Decent wine list and good values for Sing. Small, so best to make a booking. If you go for brunch/lunch, stroll through the neighborhood ... Forty Hands for coffee across the street, Books Actually for cute local shop, the Tiong Bahru market, the new Tiong Bahru bakery for pandan flan and other sweets.
4
I really loved their iced coffee with milk and am still craving for it. Food portion was quite small by my standards, unless it's with fries and bread. Had the roasted salmon. Not too crowded when I went there on a Monday for lunch, nice to just chill with friends over a meal. Can pop over to strangelets, books actually, 40 hands and walk a bit further to Tiong Bahru Bakery for a good selection of croissants
4
Located in Tiong Bahru, up and coming neighborhood in Singapore, this restaurant is worth the visit. Creative menu and good execution are their hallmarks. Favorites: steak tartar, leek soup, mushroom risotto, beef cheek.Nicely varied wine list and a promise to store your unfinished bottle up to seven days after your last visit..
5
This is a cool joint to hang out and have a few drinks and dinner. The seats looking into the kitchen are entertaining if there's just two of you as it's like theatre! The food is fantastic, nice wine list, friendly service, buzzing atmosphere, and the fit-out is very hip and happening
5
We were directed by a business contact. Went with my 20+ daughter while on business in Singapore. No reservation, (which is a must) so we sat bar stool like at the window to the kitchen. The functioning of the kitchen was amazingly soothing. They function very well,a dn the cleanliness removes any worries one might have on quality.Service was solid, friendly without being over the top. The look of the restaurant is fantastic. Mismatched chairs, metal tables, and metal ceiling tiles, all adds a kind of "Outback goes to LA" kind of feel.The food, which from soup to main to desert, was fantastic. I am well travelled and the mushroom risotto with Truffle flakes, is on par with any presentations I have had in Italy or elsewhere.The staff recommended to order certain deserts early to allow preparation, and the apple crumble....wow!I can highly recommend this spot to anyone who wants to get away form the food court atmosphere of most city restaurants, and really experience great food and a chance to see the non shopping mall infused SIngapore.****
3
Much anticipated visit after hearing some good reviews, but left somewhat underwhelmed. The service was unattentive at first and the drinks took an age to arrive. Strange wine list (mostly australian and austrian reds) and we were hard-sold on an Austrian wine that was ok at best. The food was very tasty, albeit very small serving sizes. Nice ambience, but lacked polish, appreciation for detail and wasn't the complete experience I had hoped for
5
Open Door Policy takes you away from the beautiful concrete jungle that is modern singapore and takes you into the backstreets of Tiong Bahru. A little bit noisy, a little bit not too polished, and great service charmed us. Sitting watching the kitchen team was fun. Pappadum crumbed duck with mint yoghurt dip, and tuna carpaccio with radish and yuzu salad to start were enticing. For mains the roast pork belly with black chorizo cassoulet and chill crab linguini for mains were perfectly cooked. Crab in the linguini was not just a small smattering but enough to actually taste the sweetness which was perfectly complimented by the chilli and lettuce sauce. Espresso martinis rounded us out nicely, after a lovely Italian red wine with our dinner
