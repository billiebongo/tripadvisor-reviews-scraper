We had a decent and reasonably priced meal jus last week. Clearly some interesting menu items which warrants repeat visits.. Their cheesecake is lovely and utterly spoiled for choice with their wide offerings in flavors. Awesome meal that was!

Had wonderful experience for great food and ambience. Wide variety of cheesecakes. Highly recommendable.

Love the cheesecakes and the other food on and off menus.... Great place to relax and chill out with your family and friends.

Whilst this family run restaurant does a selection of meals, the choice and quality of the homemade cheesecakes is a MUST for any cheesecake lover. The brandy cheesecake and rum and raisin are AWESOME and this has become my No.1 place to enjoy cheesecake with a cup of English breakfast tea during the weekend. Worth a visit and if your Singaporean...what are you waiting for!!

These cheesecakes are the first ever I have ever had that I can distinctly taste the flavours that were promised.I had the Chocolate Bailey's and it was the bomb! The cheesecake was fragrant with the bailey's, and the chocolate complemented the cake really well. The owner, Ms. Cannice Lee, was really friendly and gave the entire bistro a very warm and cosy feel. Will definitely recommend cheesecake lovers with an adventurous palate!

So I went looking for a comfortable homey place to eat and my hungry tummy happily found this place.Walked Joo Chiat Road about 4-5 blocks and most places open at night are pubs.I had their Laksa Pasta which is now my favorite alternative to the traditional soupy Laksa.Paired that with an ice blended lychee drink and I'm a happy diner.Didnt try their cakes though as I'm not in the mood for dessert after the filling pasta dish.The lady that owned or worked there is also very friendly and efficient

A friend recommend me to try their cheesecake so went in and bought 3 diff flavor home, 'White Oblivion, Blueberry cheesecake and Oreo cheesecake'.White Oblivion cheesecake was the best compare to the other 2 cakes. My family and I love the cheese taste, it's not very strong and the taste is just nice. Not very sweet too.

This place is so quaint, not too big with a huge selection of food and wine. And it definitely has some wonderful cheesecakes such as the the salted caramel and mango flavor. The owner/chef and the servers are friendly. Although, my friend and I came for the cheesecakes and tea, I will definitely come back to try their food next visit. What I love is the fact that the service was not stingy since I came in for their cheesecakes ;). The pastry chef came and chatted with us as well. Overall, I highly recommend the cheesecakes - they are light and not too sweet - complimentary to the humidity of Singapore

With 26 or so different cheesecakes to pick from it was hard to decide which ones to try. I finally chose the peachy peachy cheesecake and I didn't regret my decision. The Baileys cheesecake is also insanely good! I also ordered some food. Again I was spoilt for choice, but if I had to recommend anything, I would say the Thai curry or the ribs

Really good little place. I was slightly sceptical when I saw only 3 reviews and all of them 5 stars (as there seem to be a number like that in Singapore...) but this place is legitametly that good. I only gave 4 stars really to break that trend. I had slow cooked pork ribs with fries and a little salad with balsamic dressing followed by Oreo cookie flavour cheesecake. Great comfort food after a long while away from home. Also they serve Hoegaarden for $9 a 330ml bottle, nice surprise
