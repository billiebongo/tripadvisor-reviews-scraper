Friendly service, nice and bouncy fish balls and springy noodles. Only problem is the long q :(
Try to go before lunch hours to avoid the long wait.

It is a must try experience when you are at the Ang Mo Kio Blk 628 Hawker Centre, opposite the Yio Chu Kang Community Club. Be prepared for long queues on a daily basis with an average of 20 to 30 minutes of wait time. Prices are reasonable and noodles are tasty. My family loves it!The lady boss will remember your order by heart when you become a frequent customer. I have become their weekly customer since many months back.
