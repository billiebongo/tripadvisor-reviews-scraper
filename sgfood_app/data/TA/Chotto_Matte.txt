good service , good music, food is nice, but menu options are limited, too little vegi , doesn't seem to be the best choice if heading to healthy diet a few things are out of stock ....
2
Quality of the food is not worth the money. King mushrooms smells a bit stale. Grilled scallops are not juicy, seaweed wraps are not crispy.
5
Nice place, decent food, good value (with the promotion).
Need a car to get there, and need to parallel park. :)
3
The sashimi looked pale and not very appetizing. If not for the 1 for 1 lunch promotion, doubt I would patronizing the restaurant.
4
Small place, but really nice and quiet atmosphere~
Food seems pricey but had a great 1 for 1 lunch deal
3
At full price not recommended. Cheaper and better Japanese food at tras street eateries. Will not return.

Visited this restaurant on a Sat, on the basis of a 1-for-1 set lunch promotion advertised on chope.com as "available every day". However upon arrival the restaurant informed that the promotion is only valid Mondays to Fridays and refused to offer us the promotion, despite us showing them the chope.com page with the clear statement. When we said we had already made the trip to their location and asked what they could do for us, they said there was nothing they could do at all. The attitude of the service staff was appalling, with zero focus on customer satisfaction. Suffice to say we will never ever return

Chotto MatteIt's a slow day. 1.15 p.m. and I am the only customer. Left at 2.15 p.m. and I was still the only customer.Entrance - blocked by a long bar table. Most men would have to walk in sideways. Really don't understand this layout. Maybe should go in via the main door which was closed but very naturally I went to the opened door.Air conditioned but I don't understand why the door is open and traffic noise can be heard.This side serves ala carte - sushi, sashimi, starters, mains (wagyu, kurobuta, bars chiraishi, udon, pasta), donburi (fried rice too), rolls and dessert (ice cream, sorbet and mask melon).Ordered a roll - Salmon Aburi - was told it is popular - torched salmon, cucumber, tobiko (small roe) and yuzu mayo - ordinary.Also ordered edamame (green peas) - not salted enough, peas too soft.Other side (next door with separate entrance) serves omakase. That'll be too much for lunch. Been there long ago once. Was not bad. Not expensive

The food here is great, although the waiting does take some time. We had the sushi and chirashi don lunch sets and both were good. The sahimi slices are very fresh, and the wasabi is freshly grated too! And the ice cream is yummy, we had grape and matcha.Plus with 1-for-1, it is very value for money
2
Food was ok, slightly overpriced and staff were not aware of promotions that were running with Chope. Not the best place for a Sunday brunch with friends. Half of the restaurant was closed due to aircon faults and most of the drinks on the menu was unavailable. We had a quick lunch and decided to move to an alternative cafe for the remainder of the Sunday afternoon. Service can definitely improv
5
Enjoyed a beautiful evening with friends had a nice seat outdoors. Food was very very fresh and tasted absolutely beautiful. First time and would love to dine in again.
1
I made a lunch reservation at Chotte Matte but we were disappointed to discover upon arrival that the restaurant was closed. My reservation was confirmed via Chope and I did not receive any notification that the restaurant would not be open.
1
Ordered the chirashi don during lunch and the fish was very bad. It was not fresh at all. They also put furikake on the rice which stuck to the sashimi and ruined the taste.
4
Great location, ambience, service and food!
Will definitely return to try the rest of the menu!
Absolutely delicious :P
4
The food was well prepared and nice presentation. The taste is v good too!
However the preparation time is little long and the deserts seem to be always limited to less than whats on the menu.
Would hope the waitress to be more attentive.
1
I celebrated my birthday there on 17th Nov. The food took super long to come. Even the other table which came later then us got their food served first. Sashimi got served at the last. Won't be going back there again!!!
3
We choose Ã  la carte. All sushis and sashimis and skewers were really good. Seriously good. Service was a bit slow but the person looking after us was nice. On the "room for improvement" side: the restaurant was literally empty. And we were not able to choose the table we wanted. No need to say that the table was still empty when we left. The location is nice, but the restaurant needs a serious refurbishment. For a 200SGD per person we are hoppin for more than a plastic fake ugly 2sgd Christmas decorations. You also hear a lot the aircon or what ever ventilation system. You actually need music a bit loud to cover it (and they do!). Finally the washroom is awful. It need to be fixed/refurbed.
3
Now the promotion for lunch is (1 for 1 set lunch). They charge separately for green tea!We ordered Chirashi Don, the sashimi was fresh. Portion size average.It comes with a very small salad, soup and a dessert (a scope of very sweet passion fruit ice-sorbet).Overall experience is 4.5/10.
5
I have been a couple of times to this restaurant. It is nested in a cute neighbourhood and has a nice homely feel to it with some relaxing music to have a chilled one with mates. The staff are all extremely lovely and helpful. I would definiately recommend it for a nice dinner date out

We were their with our family of kids for a Sunday lunch. Took the 1-for-1 lunch offer of wagyu beef for $30 and a few sets of Omakase lunch at $88 each. The free flow of green tea cost $5 per person.Contrary to most reviews, we find the service to be prompt and polite. It was a very small restaurant and we were the only ones there during lunch that day. The waitress was very polite, she topped up the tea promptly and also noted that my husband could not take beef, so she informed the chef to change some of the Omakase dishes for him.Kids liked the wagyu sets, but found the meal a bit too little for them, so they ordered another plate of California maki to share. The omakase was good but had too much fried food, we would have preferred more sashimi or lightly cooked dishes, like what the chef at Hashi did for us. Although it was a casual setting, the lunch for our family of five was well over $300, close to $400, even after credit card discounts and 1-for-1 offers, so it is not a cheap place to go. Kids eventually had an early dinner as they were still not full after the meal.On crowded evenings, do note that there is only street-side parking nearby or you will need to head further down for alternative parking arrangements
4
Chirashi don was very well balanced. Presentation of sashimi platter could be better. Nice ambience.
3
Serving was way too small. As a female, I had to order 2 mains for myself. Food was so-so for that price.
2
Our set lunch took 2 hours in total. Food was fresh, "ok". Nothing spectacular. Ice green tea took 30mins to serve. Overall nice staff but really really slow. Food was mediocre.
5
We were there to celebrate my uncle's birthday. The food is excellent and of good quality. We particularly enjoyed the chargrilled wagyu with truffle sauce. The Omakase set was also very creative and enjoyable. To our delight, the chef happily accepted our special order for the occasion, and dish out a fragrant, tasty and heavenly foie gras fried rice (not in the menu). The Sake selection is quite wide and of good quality. We were back there for lunch on Sunday and were rewarded with their superb wagyu don with onsen tamago. We would recommend this place for a gathering between 4 to 6 persons in a rustic and cosy environment
5
Second time visiting this lovely place for omakase and discovered there was a change in chef and menu. Service was outstanding with the restaurant staffsfor taking note that it's for a special birthday celebration and reserving counter seats for us. Dinner was very interactive with the chef dishing out all his sinful and awesome creations. The menu never fails to surprise me with interesting names such as a "threesome" sushi. It was a first visit for my friend and definitely you have gained a new fan!:
3
The first visit to Chotto Matte was with a big group of 8 diners. The restaurant obviously couldn't cope, as the food came out painfully slowly. The waitress was almost useless, we later found out she was new, fortunately the restaurant manager came to the rescue.Since the food was really quite good I visited again yesterday drawn by the one for one main meal offer with the DBS card. My 2nd visit was slightly disappointing, as they had run out of a couple of my favourite dishes - apparently they only order ingredients once a week??? And we were late, reservation at 8.30 pm on a Saturday evening. So....Starters : My favourite foie gras and unagi arrived cold. Never mind it was still delicious.Must try the kurabuta pork salad - they were out of itFor the mains:Skip the cod and risotto, cod is practically tasteless.Grilled wagu beef was good.No beetroot - ran out Wagu don with onsen egg is delicious.Good selection of sakes- try the one with peach and jasmine flavour. They ran out after one serve but manager was very kind and gave us the last bit on the house.Wait staff seem to be all temps, they don't know much. Service is patchy but they do try. Price wise mains are $30 and upwards, starters around $18 uowards. The restaurant has good food but lacks consistency so be prepared for either a great experience or a mediocre one.
1
Arrived restaurant with reservations and table was not set. Was not served tea and had to request for it after ordering and waiting.Ordered sake and didn't arrive until much later.Inexperienced staff who muttered "so sorry" countless times throughout the night. Served sashimi with no soy sauce and chopsticks and side plates. Had to request for them.Side plates came but was dirty and request for change.Portions were small and grilled scallops was over cooked and ika peso was over fried too.Very disappointing and staff was not experienced/trained.Food quality is substandard and almost like those run of mill sushi chains like sushi teh.
5
A friend of mine introduce me to Chotto Matte's Omakase . For the price I've paid for the food , sake and dining experience totally worth it. Freshness of sashimi , not forgetting to mention about their aburi sushi melts inside my mouth definitely mind blowing. Their head chef I believe name "Alan" accompany my stay thru out the whole dinning which you would never get that kind of special service from anywhere else. Over all satisfy with their service and food.
5
Was seated at the Sushi Counter at the private dining area. Tried the $148 Omakase and was indeed surprise by the food served. One of the dish that really caught me was the Threesome Sushi ( Wagyu, Foie Gras, Uni Sushi), something that I have never tried before and I really love the combination. There is also Hamachi Kama and Main course was being served with Wagyu drizzled with Yuzu Goma & Teriyaki Sauce. Service staff was friendly and approachable, they also shared their recommendations on the drinks. Overall experience was good and I enjoyed my dinner over at Chotto Matte. Really love the ambience and how the chef talks and entertain us as our dinner goes on. Will definitely visit again
3
The 1-for-1 set lunch was reasonable, but I would not pay for original price for what I can get. We ordered 2 other ala carte dishes which are pricey. Sashimi is very fresh on Wednesday.Most comforting is the 2 lady waitresses' attentive services and smiling faces when they serve
3
Food was just okay. Portion was small and we waited quite some time (too long really) before our food was ready, although the waitstaff did good.
5
Very good experience for our lunch here. The chef knowledgeable and the food here very fresh. The taste also not bad. Worth it!
2
Mu husband and I ordered 1for1 sashimi set which include one small bowl of green salad, a bowl of miso soup, 10pcs of sashimi and a scoop of ice cream (usual price $40++ each).Now, some of you may wonder "don't even have rice? ". You're right. They don't have those small side dishes, not even Japanese pickles that many other restaurants included.Later, we asked for a bowl of rice to share. The waitress give the "you sure you need rice kind of look" and asked "you want rice ah?" before serving us the rice. The table next to us share the same fate -- greeted with the same look and question, then they all decided not to have the rice.Eventually, when the bill came, we were not charge for the rice. My question is if rice is included in the set, why don't they just serve it.Then we were shocked to see that we were charged $10 for 2 cups of diluted green tea.When I commented that it is excessive to charge so much for the tea, the same waitress replied it's reasonable because it is refillable. My advice is order the tea only if you are very very thirsty, but even then, you may trouble the waitress too much because it is serve a very small cup.1for1 is a value for money offer, but definitely not this restaurant. It is unthinkable if one patronise without offer.
3
The quality of the food was good and the price great that it is on 1 for 1 offer. The portions however is a bit small. The restaurant is tiny and despite the fact that there were not many diners, we had to wait quite long for the food to be served. After initial 20 mins, I was told that potato is not available for the dish I ordered
1
I have booked a table for 4 pax, however once I arrives ( perfect in time) they said my table was at a special counter. However this counter was actually in a small room where they keep some raw material and dirty things. I naturally refused the place . Their answer was : or this table or you can find another restaurant. Seriously!!!!
1
We ordered the Onsen Tamago Wagyu Don, which originally had a $32 price point, down to $25 because of the Chope app. The beef slices were too thin and lacked the texture to complement the rice. The sauce was too sweet. And the beef, although fresh, lacked the myglobin sweetness that should have matched the price point. Similarly for the Kurobuta loin grill - it was overly done, and dry, and the sesame dip was too salty and killed the subtle pork flavor. The washroom was horrendous, and the floor wasn't clean. Above all, the dining area was just next to the washroom. A rather terrible experience
4
I simply love the ambience at Chotto Matte! Before the visit, I read reviews on its cocktails And they are indeed awesome! Thumbs up! We ordered chotto matte-ne and YamazakiI like the service at Chotto Matte, it is personal as the waitresses and waiters share with you what they think are nice and worth the try on their menu. However, I do find some dishes overly priced such as its black cod risotto which was bland to me and it is priced at $35-$38. The hokkaido scallops skewers was good; succulent and it melted in our mouths. The pork loin was well tenderised and the sesame dip was a good accompaniment. The kajiki sashimi was alright though I expected it to be fresher based on the standards of chotto matte.
5
Chotto Matte serves an interesting array of sushi; some of these include kinmedai carpaccio with uni, seared Hokkaido scallops with yuzu mayo dressing and edible flowers and aburi wagyu sushi(which is sushi mixed with uni and shiokobu). Having been to Japan several times myself, I was surprised by the sheer freshness of the uni and scallops which is hard to find in Singapore. One of the staff mentioned to us that the restaurant directly imports their ingredients from Japan to ensure its authenticity to the cuisine. To top it off, the fusion of other Japanese ingredients with these dishes makes it a gastronomical feast in your mouth. I think other honourable mentions would the hiramei carpaccio with wasabi tako and black cod fish with an apple curry sauce which were simply delightful as both were cooked to perfection. The cocktails at chotto matte are equally impressive as well. I would really recommend the Chotto Matte nee and haku white mountain to girls which consists of Japanese whisky not found in most bars. Would have drank more of I had frequent the place at night! With food, drinks and a chill, relaxed ambience provided within Chotto Matte, I recommend this place as a good substitute to sushi in Japan and would definitely come back for more!
5
Chotto Matte’s sushi menu certainly does not disappoint, as each bite of sushi that I ate was simply delightful. My friends and I did not expect such a lovely restaurant serving high quality Japanese food to be tucked into a tiny corner at Blair Road. Some of my favorite courses include the Aburi Wagyu Sushi, where sushi rice was mixed with uni and shiokobu, as well as the Hiramei Carpaccio with wasabi tako and black summer truffle shoyu. The Wagyu beef was a sheer delight to eat, as it was smooth yet flavorful, with sauces that further enhanced its juicy flavor. The Hiramei Carpaccio was truly one of the kind, with the wasabi tako adding a faint hint of spiciness that brought out the freshness of the Carpaccio, and the black summer truffle was the tip of a spectacular gastronomical iceberg as it added a brilliant ‘crunch’ to the overall taste.It was also a pleasant surprise when I tasted the daikon white radish marinated with shoyu and sake, topped with foie gras. I am not fond of vegetables, but the daikon was full flavor I couldn’t help but finish it all. Apparently according to the chef, they marinated the daikon for hours to ensure that the flavor fully seeps into it. The tofu rolls and the salmon rolls were also a gastronomical delight. I have never tasted such fresh seafood cooked to perfection before. Chotto Matte’s meal is certainly worth every cent

We made a reservation for an early dinner for 3 persons and there were no other diners in the place when we arrived. Despite this, the service was indifferent.2 of our 3 first choice main courses were not available. Not a good start. Our alternative choices for the main courses arrived before the starter. Small portions of wagyu beef and kurobuta pork - overcooked and over salted. The salad starter arrived sometime later. Again over sauced and topped with some sort of deep fried, battered kurobuta pork belly. There was an extensive choice of sushi, sashimi, rice bowls, pasta and skewers on the menu which we did not sample and may have been very good but our simple sampling of the food was not a pleasant experience
5
Had an awesome Japanese dinner at Chotto Matte. Service is good and attentive and love the Wagyu Foie Gras fried rice, Wagyu Onsen Donburi, sushi and rolls. Highly recommended and will definitely be back more. Had a wonderful time with my family.
4
Went there for lunch, was surprised by the quality of the food. The foie gras fried rice was good . Also had the sashimi set and sushi set. Good value. Also tried the teppan wagyu beef.
2
not worth paying for the food, is very expensive, i can get the same food at a better environment , maybe is more cheaper. very small dining area, many mosqitoes, other guest with thier kids, very noisy.worst than eating in a food court.
5
Went for a 7 course lunch meal with my friends and was delighted at the service that they provided. It was a rainy day and the chef was really nice to ask us many times if we needed hot tea to stay warm.Before serving a meal, Chef Alan will patiently introduce to us the name of the dishes and the ingredients that he had included in them. We were first served seared Hokkaido Scallop with yuzu mayo and edible flowers and were delighted that the dish was not only aesthetically pleasing, but was extremely fresh as well! We were told that the scallops were freshly flown from Hokkaido the day before!The best dish that I would highly recommend to all, is the Australian wagyu rib eye yuzu goma. The wagyu beef was cooked just to the right texture, and is absolutely one of the best restaurants serving wagyu beef
4
Had an excellent 7 course omakase dinner at Chotto Matte, and i've satisfied my cravings for fusion Japanese food with their huge range of fresh seafood and European twist. Chef Alan was really knowledgable and dedicated. We were introduced to the course for the night. The waiters were very attentive and Alan had checked in with us several times during the meal. I throughly enjoyed the salmon sushi as it was incredibly fresh and melted in my mouth immediately! (As I've heard, their seafood had been specially selected and flown into their restaurant from Japan, and after tasting it, the freshness was undeniable.) Also, the foie gras sushi with mayo was simply sublime. Alan's skilful use of the blowtorch brought out the fragrance of the foie gras yet retained the moisture of the dish. The result was a unique and incredible burst of flavours from the layers of meat.I cannot wait to go back again to try some of Alan's other creations! I would highly recommend everyone to try the food at Chotto Matte for themselves
5
Visited Chotto Matte for the 7-course omakase dinner with a friend. The restaurant was easily found at a cosy corner of Blair Road and has an elegant appearance.Chef Alan was enthusiastic in introducing all the dishes to us and made the dining experience felt very welcoming. The waiters were also attentive and meticulous. We were served a very fresh Sashimi Carpaccio with Shaved Fresh Truffle, which was a great starter to the meal. All of the dishes had beautiful presentations and reflected the chef's dedication in each of them.I feel that the highlight of the meal was the Wagyu with Radish, which was specially prepared by Chef Alan (didn't see it in the menu). The meat was absolutely tender and well done. The radish were soft and went really well with Teriyaki sauce.All in all, the restaurant left a really positive impression with the quality food and great ambience. The restaurant is excellent for a date night or a meal before happy hour with your colleagues. I would highly recommend Chotto Matte
5
Had my dinner at Chotto Matte during my trip to Singapore and completely blown away and impressed by the omakase dinner. The chef had served us very delicious sets of sushi and sashimi and exotic fusion dishes in between. Totally love the Kobe wagyu with goma dressing and the fried small fish from Japan. Not sure what it was but it was very tasty. Definitely a Japanese restaurant under my favourite list
5
Visited Chotto Matte to check out their 7-course omakase dinner. The fantastic thing about omakase is that there is no knowing what the chef would prepare for you. Turns out the meal was nothing short of amazing. Each dish was so perfect and right, can't exactly remember the exact name of each dish (Chef Alan did painstakingly attend to our queries about each dish though). Nevertheless, a couple of dishes stood out: 1) The tuna trio definitely stood out as the highlight of the meal. Each piece of tuna was distinguished from one another, and splendid in its own right. My favourite had to be the otoro slice, the even marbling throughout the slice was quite the visual spectacle. Of course, it literally melted in my mouth right after. 2) The tomahawk lamb chop was also another clear favourite. From what Chef Alan said, the lamb chop is grilled in a unique way such that the flavours were all condensed within the meat. I'm personally a huge lamb meat lover, so this segment was just perfect. 3) One final thing that really stuck to my mind was the presentation of the dishes. For a couple of the dishes, beautifully scented flower petals decorated the plate in which the individual courses were served in. Some even had tiny flower buds that (At one point, Chef Alan piped in to tell us that everything on the plate was edible) had such a delightful burst of flavour when we bit into it. All in all, I find the meal simply sublime. Chef Alan was really knowledgeable and didn't fail to impress us with both his culinary expertise and charismatic demeanour. The setting of the restaurant was really elegant, and it made for an extremely pleasant dining experience. While the price may be mildly steep at first glance, the quality of the entire experience more than made up for it. Definitely would recommend Chotto Matte
5
A friend and I visited the restaurant on a weekday for the 7-course omakase dinner. We had a dinner worth $128++ for a special price of $88++ because of an ongoing deal, which was an excellent deal for such a complex and delicious meal. We were taken through a wonderful 7-course meal, starting with a light, aromatic hamachi carpaccio marinated with shiokobu and aged for two days. We were also served the bluefin tuna trio of ohtoro, chutoro and akami tuna. The tuna, imported directly from Tsukiji market, was aged perfectly for the ideal taste to emerge, and seasoned with the most aromatic spices. A sashimi platter with six different kinds of fish was also served, of which the scallop sashimi (hotate) was exceptionally unforgettable. The sashimi platter was then quickly followed by a deliciously decadent trio of aburi sushi. Blowtorched to perfection, the aburi salmon, scallop salmon, and wagyu-foie gras-uni salmon was indeed a treat for the tastebuds. We also tried the miso-glazed lamb tomahawk - which was char-grilled and done to an excellent medium rare. We then finished the meal with a special ice cream infused with yuzu, which was the ideal ending to the meal. Throughout the meal, Chef Alan introduced all the dishes to us, which made the meal extremely enjoyable. He was also enthusiastic and accommodating to all our requests. I would definitely recommend Chotto Matte for an elegant, fine dining experience, be it with family, friends, or for business. Be sure to book in advance to ensure the best seats in the dining room

It was a pleasant experience. It was air conditioned with nice music. Service was good. Food was even better. We ate the Wagyu Foie Gras Fried Rice at a exclusive price of $25++ (booked through Chope) and 2 different salmon rolls. Bring along your UOB credit card for additional discount
5
Had one of the best Omakase so far. Will recommend it's Ala carte menu like the Wagyu foie gras fried rice :)
5
Lovely corner restaurant at a gorgeous enclave on Blair Road.
A perfect venue for a date night - quiet, great service and awesome food.
Staff was courteous and polite. Would definitely come back!
4
The tasting menu is yumm..
It is fusion-- granted! But, fusion is good too when you don't want fuddy duddy stiff upper lip sit down Japanese.
Will be back for more.

I tried chotto matte because i read a lot of pretty good reviews about it. But when i went there everything was pretty average and i personally think its not as good as what the reviews are saying. Plus the pricing not exactly cheap for the area. I went there on weekdays and it was pretty empty too. So really don't understand where all the good reviews about this place came from. I would rather go to sushi jin than chotto matte for such fusion jap food.
5
My friends and I decided to try Chotto Matte after hearing some great reviews. Secluded in a lovely residential area of old Peranakan style homes, it was a refreshing and charming change to the usual Japanese eateries found elsewhere. We were a party of 4 for dinner and decided to have the 3 course set meal of $78 ++ per pax. The set includes in choice of a starter, main and dessert. For $108++ you can have an additional starter or they had an omakase dinner at $128 ++ per pax. The starters varied from cod fish with pomegranate miso sauce, carpaccio of hamachi with caviar and truffle soy and sashimi carpaccio with freshly shaved truffle. Mains included teppan wagyu beef with rocket and a ponzu sauce, spaghetti with uni and another wagyu beef dish with grilled vegetables and a truffle infused sauce. Everything was fresh, the beef grilled to perfection and sauces delicately flavoured. Dessert consisted of a chocolate lava cake with black sesame ice cream that was to die for. The yuzo ice cream was wonderfully refreshing and served with rock melon. Service was attentive and friendly. Ambience cosy and smart casual. I called to make a reservation and was advised a choice of 2 seatings, either at 6pm or 8pm.Tip: plenty of coupon street parking in the early evening. Season parking starts at 10pm so you need to move the car if you stay till late.
5
I celebrated my friend's bday at ChottoMatte with an omakase lunch and was blown away by the service and food. We were led to a private dining area, and sat at the counter where we could interact and watch the chef at work. Head chef Alan and his team were very friendly and asked us our food preferences / allergies before our meal. Food was fresh and superb, the team was attentive and they even surprised the bday girl with a molten chocolate salted caramel lava cake with black sesame ice cream and a bday song! Highly recommend this place and would definitely return! 
5
Had our first visit to this pre-war conserved shophouse at Blair Road n took the recommended omakase dinner. It's almost like a menu degustation with lots of surprise elements that we needed for a relax weekend. Chef Alan introduced in details each dish when served. The tomato salad was topped with special yuzu sauce. Sliced fresh octopus was sprinklered with truffle, caviar n edible flower pedals. Fresh sashimi of the day was beautiful presented. Assorted sushi was lighted torched to make the raw slice of seafood lightly cooked on the surface giving the best of both cooked n raw taste. Assistant chef surprised us with an off menu one rice grain tuna sushi which was the smallest sushi size possible. It was then followed by sticks of unagi with foie gras to simply make it the best mix of Japanese n French cuisine. Main course of wagyu beef with asparagus n Italian spaghetti sauce with some Japanese ingredient was another show of urban fusion cuisine. Finale dessert was the chocolate lava cake topped with a black sesame scoop of ice cream. Overall portioning was really generous and was a true Superlicious weekend for us :)We will be back..

This was an overdue review from Valentine's. Basically the reservation was not honored at the counter top omakase, and they had to shift a couple off which made us feel bad. Ended up being average omakase with a bottle of sake at $650 for 2 pax. Premium, I would think not given the last visit there 2 weeks earlier was better at half the price. Long story short, we hope they find their distinction for the long haul

I have never been a Foie Gras fan. But my friend said I had to try it. I was skeptical since I already knew liked it. I gave it a shot and let me tell you...I told him and his girlfriend to quit talking to me and I chewed up this delectable rich mouthful of heaven.Anyway back to the restaurant its small, unassuming but I like this small neighborhood location. You can eat outside at skinny tables or call ahead to get an inside seat. I personally like the atmosphere. Its kind of a Japanese fusion restaurant with a great sake list and Japanese whiskey too.I had great sashimi, fried rice and a spicy voiced roll that i wasn't expecting to be a highlight. I like some sort of fish in the roll but it was fantastic. I had no preconceived notion of a fancy restaurant so I had no real expectations. If you are expecting a fine dining atmosphere it's not for you. I had fine dining food and will be back
5
We went there to celebrate a low-key birthday. We had the omasake menu and every course was delicious. Each course was unique and delicious, brought out and explained in detail by the staff. Highlights were a yellow tail sashimi with truffle soy sauce, grilled ell and foie gras "skewers", a bowl of fresh sashimi and a "sashimi" combo of scallop, seared foie gras and uni. All seafood was great quality.
4
It was my first visit to this restaurant and I truly enjoyed the food. The foie gras yakitori is to 'die-for'. Love Chotto Sashimi, really very very fresh. The sushi are awesome.
5
Very fresh shashimi and the rice for sushi they used is from Hokadio. Their fried rice is something not to be missed and their wagyu yakitori is a mouth watering experience!!!
4
If not for the crispy chicken wing which we have ordered which was a miss, I would have given it a 5/5. The best dish that I would certainly recommend would be the chirashi don.
5
Lately I have become quite a Japanese food aficionado and I must say that Chotto Matte surpassed my expectations. Kagoshima Pork belly was superb as was was the fried rice with foie gras and wagyu beef. Will definitely visit again.
4
We tried their Vday Omakase and was blown away by the quality of food and service. We had a total of 11 food items which ranged from quality sashimis, mouthwatering foie gras and winter truffles dishes, yummy yakitori and rich and creamy soup.Kudos to the Chef and his team for the wonderful experience! The total damage including a bottle of sake and cocktail amounted to $300+ which was quite reasonable given the quality and servings that we had.Directions: Get out at Exit G from Outram Park MRT (Cantoment Police Station) and walk upwards and to the right towards Blair Road. The restaurant is situated near Spottiwood and Everton Park
5
I made a deal with a Japanese friend to go for a good omakase dinner. When I made the reservation, I requested for the omakase, but the restaurant called to tell me the omakase seating was fully booked for that night. To our delight, on the day itself they managed to slot us in for the omakase! Chef Roy was very friendly yet professional. He was happy to recommend to us a sake to pair with our dinner, and also accommodate our dietary requirements. All the dishes served were fresh and well-prepared, Chef Roy also explained to us what fish we were eating, and where the fish are sourced (ethically). He was also happy to chat to my friend in Japanese. There was a good balance of sushi/sashimi as well as cooked dishes. all the sushi and sashimi are the chef's choice, it was sweet and very fresh. In the middle of the meal, we were served a Teapot Soup made from boiled down fish bones. It was so deliciously sweet and comforting, that I finished all of it.Another must-have is the Wagyu Foagura Fried Rice which was so decadent and yummy! I thought it was very good value for money and plan to introduce my friends to the omakase soon! P.S - the restaurant also has an impressive collection of Japanese whiskies, perfect for an after-dinner drink

We made reservation via the chope app twice and both times, an hour before the reserved timing, the restaurant called to say there is only outside available. First time we decided to change venue immediately. Second time round, we had time to kill and decided to check out the seating to give the restaurant another chance. To our dismay, the restaurant was tiny and the outside seating for 4 people were high stools lined up in a row facing the road. Which made conversing very challenging. We would rather they tell us beforehand that there is only outside seating available. And do so in advance. It felt like we were being trapped into compromising when they call an hour before dinner time as it would be too late to make alternative plans. And when we spoke to the waiter about it, he did not seem to think it was an issue and acted nonchalant. So both times we ended up disappointed and had to change plans last minute. Once for a wedding anniversary and another for a friend's 50th birthday celebration. We will never go back no matter how good the food is. They gave the hospitality business a really bad name

Made reservation on Chope but waiter said it isn't reflected. Told me it's better I call instead. Makes me wonder about the purpose of the app? Food is fresh; Price is justifiable considering the freshness of it. Ambience was good but seating arrangements was tight; we could hear what the next table was conversing. Waiter could be more friendly and sensitive to needs.

Took my good friend there for his birthday dinner. Ordered appetisers such as uni, grilled sardines and snails. Good but small. We shared shirashi don because we came late, 9.30pm. Couldn't be shared. Small.Ordered a bottle of Italian white wine which was SGD70!! Total bill was at close to SGD300

We visited Chotto Matte as a group of 6, with a reservation that we made days before. On the day of our reservation, the chef called us twice to ask us to change our reservation to another day, because they were overbooked. When we insisted that we wanted to come as we had already made a reservation and plans accordingly, they forced us to acknowledge that we would have to sit outside and the service would be very slow. Accepting all their conditions, we arrived at the restaurant at the time of our reservation. The interior of the restaurant is basically a very small room, not seating more than 20 people max. Although we had a confirmed reservation, they seated us at a long and thin table where the 6 six of us were sitting next to each other as if at a bar and could not really talk to each other properly the entire night. While the service staff was friendly in general, the food really arrived extremely slowly and was insanely overpriced considering the very small portion sizes. For instance, a piece of Miso Cod that was listed under "plates to share" came to be at a size of 1-2 bites, and was listed at around $30. Although the food tasted good, I definitely recommend one to go to this restaurant with an almost full stomach if you don't want to end up emptying your savings account for one dinner. After having what I would classify as an amount that would be equivalent to an appetizer in any other regular restaurant and not daring to order any drinks (just ice water), we ended up paying more than $40 each for a few pieces of fish and going to another restaurant nearby for a more reasonable option and a better attitude from the chef!
