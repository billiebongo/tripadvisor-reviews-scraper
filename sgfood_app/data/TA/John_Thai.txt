Tried so many Thai eateries to match what I had in Thailand. This stall would be best for value.Ask for tom yam clear soup, basil pork/chicken, green curry and pineapple rice. Forget the rest. Demand Thai Spicy if you are adventurous. It will bring you back to Bangko

John Thai is a very unassuming stall in the Balestier Food Court, about half way down Balestier Road.The Food Court is situated next to its more illustrious neighbour, Boon Tong Kee.Why do I like this place? Well the food is of good quality; the portions are decent sizes; and the prices are low. Most dishes cost less than S$10; and many are close to the S$5 range
