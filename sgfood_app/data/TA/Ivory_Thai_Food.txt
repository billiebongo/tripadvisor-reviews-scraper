Not bad at all. After 1 month of Indian during our travels the pad Thai and fish cakes were a nice little change for our daily menu. Not too expensive and friendly staff.

We are regulars at Ivory Thai .. Most of our trips to Ivory Thai are made especially to have our dinner there which says it all .. I personally like the crab meat and Tom Yam .. This stall has a queue at most times which is a testimony to the food on offer .. One of the few stalls in a food court that I vouch for

We ate here whilst waiting for our return flight to the UK, having just had 2 weeks in Thailand and wanting to continue to enjoy the cuisine!! The food was authentic, very tasty and served very quickly by friendly staff. There was a wide range to choose from and it was all reasonably priced. Recommended
