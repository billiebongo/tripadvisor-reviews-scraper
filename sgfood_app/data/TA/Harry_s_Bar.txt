I warm and friendly atmosphere for a cool drink and a meal after work. Located off the main Orchard road and close to all the shops and MRT

While conveniently located on Orchard Road, this is at the seedier end and in the evening is a popular place for ladies of the night and mostly foreign men to meet. It has a large outdoor section which allows smoking. And beers on tap seem alright.But as a food venue, this is definitely a miss.We ordered the beef and chicken satay, fries, and the chicken wings along with some cokes. The fries were soggy, the skewers smelled off, and the coke was totally flat! The chicken wings were very salty, probably to make you thirsty, and were excessively fried to the point of being dried chicken crisps.Not my kind of scene

This place is how Harrys is supposed to be, un assuming, friendly staff, simple well executed comfort food too. Sit on the sidewalk and watch people walk by, sip on your lime juice, beer or wine. They have many friendly offers hence it won't break the bank. Staff tends to pay attention and try to remember their patrons irregardless if you spend little or a lot. Nice little place

I have to admit that I still have that awful habit - no matter how much I tried I still have to smoke 3-4 cigarettes a day. Everybody who has been in Singapore can testify that it is hard to find a city that is smoke free as Singapore. That is why Harry's Bar was a sheer heaven for me! I didn't have to smoke in some dark corner surrounded with another 5 or 10 poor devils as I was, I could sit (only a few tables were for smokers!) and enjoy a beer with a cigarette. It was the main reason to visit Harry's on daily basis

I was visiting Singapore and wanted to see the All Blacks Vs Australia rugby game. Harry's was the right choice in Novena with it located near my hotel. They had a wide selection of seating areas and also beers on tap. Really enjoyed it and would recommend you check the schedule on thier website as not all locations play the same thing.

Basically don't go here if you're young and want good music and honest service.When you order a drink they not only add the 6% city tax on to the advertised price, but also a 10% 'service charge' (even if it's not table service) AND THEN they round up a few dollars on top in the hope that you're stupid enough to not notice - this happened twice and both times when I confronted them about it they simply went to the till and gave me a few dollars back with no explanation. Cowboys. Stop stealing people's money.The live music was what pulled us in here, but the band were lifeless and uninspiring. I can't understand why they chose to play a 16 minute self-indulgent rock ballad whilst the room was booming and everyone just wanted to dance. Half the bar left! The rest of the set was just tedious 60s/70s rock aimed at drunk, ageing expats. Also why is there no live drummer on stage, just a bored guy playing with his fingers on an electric pad?! We're not blind you know - why don't you use all the money you've stolen off customers and buy him a real drum kit

We went for happy hour and got 2 for one house drinks. Waitress was extremely helpful and we ordered from the evening specials. Both my friend and myself enjoyed the drinks and food and would go back again. Good value for money and we got good service, food and drinks

Ordered a steak meal, and based on Singapore prices I expected something special, it wasn't.It was under cooked to how I explained I wanted it done. The manager then basically gave me a row for wanting it medium.Only went once and wouldn't go bac

Nice place to wind down after a heavy days walking in Singapore and sip a nice cold beer. But avoid the food. Much better options in the same area. The burger was not that great. The chicken burger was also quite ordinary. The food was forgettable. Service was pleasant

Had three great nights listening to Zul Sultan and his excellent band at Harry's and thoroughly enjoyed every moment. Beer was cold and delish, staff was friendly and efficient, and bar food good. I would highly recommend hanging out and singing along with the band - they take requests and are super friendly between sets

GreT location but the food was terrible and that is not an education.
We had Harry's platter which you think would be their signature dish.
Shocking.
Just have adri k here do not eat.

Quick service and very polite staff, meals are a good standard and normal mid range price, my pick is the Harry's Wings special, beer is a little over priced and should be colder.

Great location, nice bar, free peanuts and a ridiculously expensive Singapore Sling.
Bar staff were friendly enough but not personable.

Great band playing here, and they do a good drink deal too, you can order the drinks before 8pm and drink them at your leisure during the evening.

Great place to eat in Singapore. Been here before and will be be back again. Food is a mix of western and Asian. Prices are reasonable and the staff are very friendly.

Excellent location but in quiet location. My favourite Harry's Bar. Good friendly staff. Superb range of drinks and pub food available. Happy hour available.

Popped in for a late night drinks and snacks. The beer was cold, the tandoori chicken tasty and there was a very good covers band playing 70s rock.  It's moderately expensive but seems by far the best choice in the immediate neighbourhood. It's definitely a bar for old fogeys not 'the youth'. Unless you are a young person who likes the 70s and wants a laid back friendly atmospher

I went to Harry's bar to get some comfort food and was not disappointed. I had steak, egg and chips was delicious and it was washed down with two pints of their own brand lager which was also tasty. Good food, nice beer and good friendly service at reasonable prices; just what you need

Guys just go for it. This place is amazing. Went there with my brother for a quick beer but ended up spending couple of hours there. They gave me a good offer with a bucket of beers. The service was top notch. The wings and fries were finger licking good. Sat on the outside with a view of the street. Enjoyed the location. If you are around orchard road. Just come in for some awesome food and drinks

I quite liked the atmosphere of this bar. Okay, it isn't hugely fantastic, but it did have a nice feel about the place, though though I was only here in the afternoon which meant that the bar (and Clarke Quay in particular) was pretty quiet, but them again I don't really mind it when it is quiet. Okay, it certainly wasn't the cheapest of beers around, but then again this is something that I have come to expect from Singapore (though it isn't anywhere near as bad as some places). Mind you, one of the things that I have discovered in Singapore, and Harry's Bar is no exception, is that there tends to be only one size of beer â€“ large. Personally, it did sort of annoy me somewhat, but I still didn't mind this place
