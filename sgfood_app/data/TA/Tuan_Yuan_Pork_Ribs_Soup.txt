A good place for the light, peppery varietal of Bak Kut Teh, this restaurant also serves steamed fish, braised pork knuckles, salted vegetables, tofu and vegetables, making for a complete meal. The restaurant is clean and aircon. Open from 11 am till 1 am daily.

Chanced upon this branch while in the area searching for a place to eat. Food quality is the same as that of PSA building, great service and nice air conditioned indoor seating. Will be one of my main fixes for good and simple dinner option.

Very crispy you tiao, small portion which is just nice. They serve great steam fish that is very fresh. Bak Kut Teh is not as salty as most places. Great service when it comes to adding soup or adding orders.

1. A traditional coolie’s dish from out Chinese forefathers is now all-time favourite for both Singaporeans and visitors.2. Tuan Yuan’s pork meat quality is very consistent. Also liked the steamed threadfin fish.3. Soup base for the pork rib soup is white peppery/garlic style..and you can choose the intensity level, recommended to dip the fried dough sticks 油条 into the soup, ......and if you like vegetables, order the Tang-o, very generous portion compared to the rest of the other shops.4. friendly, approachable staff with efficient service....hear that there is an app where you can pre-order (haven’t tried it though

Bak Kut Teh aka Peppery Pork Rib Soup is one of our family favourite food. We chanced upon this joint while we were at Tiong Bahru. Tucked away from the usual buzzing of Thing Bahru, it is located in the quiet neighbourhood of Kim Tian. We have ordered their signature Bak Kut Teh, braised pork knuckle, oyster-sauce vegetable, fried fritters, pork liver/kidney. The broth/Soup was delightfully cooked. Every mouth we took, we were able to taste the natural sweetness and essence of the ribs. Its peppery taste was just right. Even my eldest gal who can't take spicy very well, enjoyed the soup as they offered non-spicy version which was equally superb minus the hotness of pepper.My son enjoyed the soup so much that he made an effort to tell the boss, Frankie Gwee. He even showed us how his bak kut teh was prepared. The soup went through four different stages of cooking before it is served. Fresh pork bones will be added to increase the 'intensity' of the soup. If you ever visit this joint, be sure to ask the owner for a kitchen tour so that you understand how much thought and sincerity the owner has put into preparing. This joint is highly recommended especially for those of us who just want to shun touristy joints

It was a prompt visit since my son is longing for soup dish. We thought there is only bak kut teh but we were offered pork meat ball with clear soup. All of us (4 of us) enjoyed the dinner very much. It was the warmth Winter Solstice ever for the past 6 years

Visited recently with a bunch of friends late night at about 2am it was welcoming and friendly service by their staff. Good recommendations from their menu too. Wonderful and tasty pork ribs soup and the rest of the dishes. Prices could be slight pricey but overall sharing its still reasonable. Good environtment and good food!

If you love very peppery soup, here's the bak kut teh place to try! The restaurant was nice and comfortable when I went at 9pm. Not crowded, but my braised tofu was sold out. And if you must have the braised pig intestines with bak kut teh - please note that they don't offer it here. Prices are typical of bak kut teh places. I would have loved my soup less peppery and please add the intestines to the menu.

There are several types of Bak Kut Teh - there's the Teochew style which is mildly peppery; the Hokkien style which is ferociously peppery; the KL style which is more gravy-like with dried chilli and herbs; and, then the Herbal style.Tuan Yuan is the Hokkien style - ferociously peppery! The way my family and I like it!Tuan Yuan's origin was from Ya Hua at Tanjong Pagar PSA. I guess they split and started Tuan Yuan about 1.5 years ago.The flavours are simply heavenly - it's my "go-to-comfort-food" every time I return from South Asia! Miss the peppery soup and PORK!!! My wife loves the pig stomach soup! The "ngor her buey" (threadfin fish tail) is steamed to perfection.Simple menu serving great authentic Bak Kut Teh. Location is quite central - but the parking can be quite a maze to navigate to Tuan Yuan and back! Get your bearings right and leave a trail of breadcrumbs!Service is GOOD. They try hard to please and delight. I think the staff are more motivated with the boss dressed in his chef whites serving customers, talking to customers and clearing tables too! Management By Example and Walking The Talk - something very lacking in today's businesses (even government!) and service industry! So Kudos to the Boss and his team!I think they are closed on Mondays and open for almost 19 hours a day... from 0800HR to 0300HR, Tuesday to Sunday. So be it breakfast, lunch, dinner, supper or after-drink detox, Tuan Yuan is "die-die-must-try"

Tried it out on 26 Oct'16, restaurant was spacious and clean. Service was great as the waiting time was fast. Bak Kut teh meat very soft and peppery taste, is to my likings!

Although it has the usual dishes found in most bak kut teh restaurant, the taste of the soup and the tender meat for the price you pay will differentiate it from most.

An authentic Singaporean Bak Kut The which has modernized greatly with app and such. Boss and family work together with a great happy team. Service is always amazing and deserves a recognition to the tourists and people all around. A place to always return and enjoy if craving for this meal

Setup by one of the siblings of the Outram Ya Hua Bak Kut Teh. It has up the game by introduction of cell phone ordering system and house in nice and aircon premise.The pork rib was cooked to perfection and the soup was very tasty. They also offer some nice steam fish dishes which I was told the owner Frankie personally buy them from the wet market daily. We experienced slight drop in food standard during the last 2 trips. It may be caused by the new cook. Service was tip-top and very friendly

This was my first experience with this local style of food. The restaurant is located in a government mixed use complex with retail, housing and parking. It is simple and clean. Service was very fast, as everything seems to of been already hot on the stove. The pork soup was tasty with spices and lots of salt.

Bak Kut Teh tasted similar to other famous bak kut teh in Singapore, albeit with a way better atmosphere. Though bak kut teh could be a little salt-ish for some, you could customize your options by asking them to mix with hot water. Other dishes such as vermicelli noodles soup, Tofu, and vegetables dishes were tasted fresh and tasty. Worth patronizing again

The pork here is so tender & the soup is so majestic, this place should get a Michelin star! My colleague brought me here & I was so thrilled with my meal. Every bite I took had me moaning & growling like a madman! Like pork? Come here. Like Soup? Come here. Like lovingly crafted food made with superior ingredients? Eat here please! In Singapore for a short holiday & want to try some quintessential local food? Eat here again! Wow wow wow!

Been to Tuan Yuan at least once a month since Dec 2015...just getting to review to compliment the Gwee family for their superb service and BKT....Nothing I write will do justice to the BKT...so will contribute on the extra touches.Great attention to details in customers' comfort. Boss Gwee planted row of bamboo "plants" to provide extra greenery and act as sun shield for customers who prefer the al fresco seats.If not a fan of Pork, they have sliced fish in pork rib soup or whole steamed fish.Then there are the "fried to order" Yu Char Kway(fried dough fritters)...simply brilliant that they even think about serving freshly fried YCK that pairs well with the BKT soup....1 order is never enough.For those with a higher budget, go for can of Abalone...chewy goodness worth the money.Going to Tuan Young tomorrow....

I suppose the pork rib quality is ok considering the price. However the soup is a little too pepper-ish for my taste. Also I would have prefer the rib bone rather than the end pieces which they gave us. Not sure if this is the standard pieces they serve. On the night we were there, a big group of Tourists (?) came in so it was quite noisy as they were all speaking at the top of their voices. Not sure if they have this kind of 'event' regularly. So if you want lower price pork rib soup, I suppose this place is ok. I will go for better quality ones elsewhere.

Service was very good. Immediately when we sat down, the waiters do not hesitate to bring chilli and soya sauce to us. Food was served hot in less than 2 minutes by the super friendly (must emphasize on this cause we can hardly see good service in sg) waiters. The soup was good for those who like their soup to be loaded with pepper taste. As for the food, I'll give a 7/10
