Java+ is ok to have a bite or a quick drink. Nothing special, but ok if you have to wait for someone

Located at the main lobby of the Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel, it provides a quick relief from the busy street and shopping stress. In the evening, you may be able to purchase their delicious pastries with a very good discount.

Had a very satisfying simple dinner (a plate of hokkien mee and a cup.of cuppocinno) at Java+ yesterday. I was surprised that the assistant manager, Ms Helen remembers what the diner likes/dislikes. She has product knowledge, and always wears a smile.

This place is located just outside of the Marriott Cafe and in fact, I did mistook the Java+ as part of the Marriott Cafe. The Java+ sells pastries, cakes, drinks etc but they are pricey. Seating is within the cafe or also around the lobby area. They also offer take away and if I remembered correctly, there were some pretty good discounts after 6pm which I took advantage off

This place is always crowded and sometimes it is very difficult for Marriott inhouse guests to seek a table reservation during peak hours. The lunch and dinner buffet is a great spread but the speed of service is very slow if one opts for food from the menu. One has to ask for cutlery and napkins and it seems the place may be a bit understaffed during peak hours. Quality of food is good and one can give it a try if in Orchard Road. Price is affordable

Refillable 3 tier tea with hot savouries, finger sandwiches, scones and cakes. Unlimited servings from tea/coffee menu. There is an alcove with more privacy. The open area tends to be crowded with a lot of passing human traffic. In reality, we got one round of refill because the food is refilled per type - they go round the tables refilling sandwiches, then half an hour later another food type etc. When I was there, I sampled 2 types of coffee and a pot of tea.Without discounts, the full price of SG$33++ per head (minimum 2 pax) is a little steep for the quality and average ambience
