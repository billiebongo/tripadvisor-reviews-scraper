Great service from the waitresses and food served are nice. Pork collar appetizer is recommended! Waitresses will help to refill your bowl of your soup when they saw the bowl is empty.
5
Mango salad; fried spring roll; claypot otah; olive fried rice. These were the specialty items ordered and did not disappoint.
5
We liked everything, the food, the atmosphere and the service. We will come again. I can only recommend this place for authentic Thai food.
5
the food is delicious and service is not bad. Price-wise it is not too exp.. quite reasonable for the food
3
Compared to our first visit here, the restaurant seems more crowded but understaffed. Order was quick but we waited really long for our food to come. Food was decent and no service charge!

I ate here last night and had a fantastic meal.Tom Yum Talay was delicious and spicy just as I like it. Served in a clay pot and kept warm on its candle stand, there was enough for two people in the small option.The Red duck curry was rich and creamy but with a pleasant surprise of lychees that cut through the richness of the dish, delivering a nice sweetness. Paired with the pineapple rice and mixed vegetables it was perfect. Again two could probably share this and another dish in the small size.The lemongrass chilled drink I found to be a nice palate cleanser at the end of the meal.The service was excellent and the restaurant clean.I'll definitely come back if I'm in Singapore again

i have to this place quite a few times in past years. food used to be very good and original thai food. today is quite disappointibg. price also go up. while the ambience is still good. i will probably come back when there is visitors in town.
5
We started with the appetizers, a spicy and tangy clear base Tom Yum Gong, kept hot throughout our meal being served in a claypot above a burning candle.We had the Crab Springrolls and I loved it, crispy and filled with chunks of crab meat. The otah was a little plastic-ky for me but I loved that presentation.The steam seabass that’s both sweet and spicy is a must order. Very fresh too! The Olive Rice is also absolutely a must. Well flavored and perfect pairing with the honey chicken slices. And this was the small portion already, would have been just nice for 3 of us but I couldn’t resist the Tang Hoon with Prawns, and no regrets at all.And you shouldn't miss out on the desserts. Beautiful plating that is totally insta-worthy! One can seldom find colored sticky rice in Singapore so I’m pleasantly surprised they served it here, would have been perfect if the Mango was super sweet like the ones in Bangkok. The coconut ice cream is a must order! Portion is rather small for that price but totally worth every calorie!Overall a great dining experience. Ambience is cosy, accompanied by soft Thai music in the background, very friendly and proactive servers who constantly watched us attentively and came by to top up our soup bowls and clear the finished plates. One of them patiently waited while I was trying to get the Chope app to work to purchase discount vouchers but eventually I got too embarrassed as the app hung and hung after a few tries.I can't wait to return to try the other dishes!

We stumbled upon this restaurant by chance on a Sunday afternoon without reservation and boy were we glad we did.The service was superb and the waiting time for placing our orders and receiving the food wasn't too long.We ordered the pomelo salad, seafood tom yum soup (best I've had in Singapore), boneless chicken and pad thai. They were all superbly delicious and the quality of the ingredients and the cooking really shone through. It's clearly an establishment that prides itself on standards and quality.Ambience of the restaurant was calm and suitable for business lunches, family gatherings and special occasions. Highly recommend this place
4
We ordered most of the recommended dishes. Food was generally good. The most disappointing was mango glutinous rice. The mango is sour! i have been a fan of this desert and would definitely order whenever i am at a thai restaurant. However, i have never had sour mango. Was disappointed.
5
Nice atmosphere, with the soft thai music. Service was great and the food was amazing. Keep it up guys!!
5
I tried two times in this restaurant and both times I liked the food and services.
For Vegetarians, they have a lot of options as well.
Must try mango sticky rice with coconut milk for deserts
5
Was intimidated by the grandeur of the restaurant from the outside. Was pleasantly surprised by the pricing, really affordable and value for money. They used premium ingredients but charge really reasonably.
Premium ingredients with Thai food, very delicious and highly recommended.
5
They food were fresh n delicious...
totally worth the pricing..
Their staff r always helpful n nice.. no question ask if we feedback on the food... they will change it(too spicy to little or non spicy)..
4
Nice ambience, excellent service and most importantly the food were all yummy. Worth to go back again.
5
came here with my girlfriends on a tuesday night and it was extremely quiet - probably only 3-4 other tables were occupied in our time there. ordered the olive rice, mango salad, green curry and kang kong. the mango salad and green curry were quite standard, and kang kong was better than average. what really stole the show was the olive rice, which came with sides of honey chicken strips, dried shrimps, chilli padi and lime pulp. we mixed it (save for chilli padi) and every bite was super flavourful. would come back again. this place has been around for quite some time (i used to work around the same stretch) and i rarely see it full house. it's a shame cos the food's really good
4
Went for lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant is 1/2 full. Ordered the coconut soup, fried fish maw and the olive rice. All was fabulous! The coconut soup was very favourable. The fried fish maw in eggs and bean sprouts were to die for. The olive rice was yummy! Unfortunately the mango sticky rice was nit available! Disappointed!Highly recommended! Definitely will be back to taste the other dishes!
5
Saw a local blogger raving about this Thai restaurant of 16 years. Decided to come with my family for dinner. It was very crowded on a Friday night, but service was prompt and attentive.Food was absolutely delicious, each dish looked very pretty.This will be my go-to Thai restaurant from now on
4
Loved the food, very flavorful and interesting combinations. The pomelo salad was interesting and something we recommend. Had beef curry, white rice and some vegetables and fried chicken with that salad and was a bit too much for two.Portions are big!Service was good, ambience was plain and simple, modern and clean but still cosy. Not very romantic, but still a nice place for a dinner with a loved one
4
Being a long standing thai restaurant in Singapore, Sawadee Thai is reasonably priced serving above average thai food.Service was prompt and portion is generous. If you dont mind walking a bit to find the restaurant tucked between some bridal shops, this is definitely worth a visit
4
Had a great dinner at Sawadee which we would recommend for more refined Thai dishes - the Seabass is a must try!
5
The place was nicely decorated with Thai-inspired wallpapers and furniture. I like the thai music playing in my background too, almost forget I'm in Singapore! Oh yes and always must try the signature food you will not regret it! AUTHENTIC BROOOOO
5
Really enjoyed the food at Sawadee. This was my first time here, and it did not disappoint. I look forward to returning with friends.
2
Unfortunately Sawadee did not live up to expectations for a birthday celebration with a group of 5.Our starters consisted of dry (chewy) pork neck and overcooked crab spring rolls (which arrived after 40 minutes because 'it was busy') with little flavour.Main dishes included a pretty tasty crab curry and a steamed fish Thai style which tasted ok but was again overcooked. Vegetable dish (kale) consisted of chewy leaves and little flavour which we sent back. Our pad thai was ok (but lacking ingredients, mostly plain noodles) - frankly the Pad Thai we had a few days earlier at Lao Pa Sat food market for a quarter of the price had much more flavour. Pineapple fried rice was fine.Service was poor, taking ages to take orders, bring drinks - finally we had to ask three waiters before we finally got the bill. Every time the excuse was that it was 'busy'.The place was cramped, with no space to walk between tables and way too hot. Overrated
5
A delicious Thai restaurant with great ambience and excellent service. They were very attentive with our preference of toning down on the spice, and kindly gave us each dish with the bird-eye chilli as a choice of side. Presentation was marvelous too. The perfect place for your craving of Thai cuisine. Will definitely be back
5
I would say my three experiences so far at Sawadee Thai are all perfect!! The olive oil fried rice never fail my recommendations to my friends:) The salads I have tried: papaya, pamelo and gree mango, all got their special fragrance. Last but not least, all the four desserts are incredible.. Especially the sticky rice and steamed tapioca (not sure if I spelled right), which are amazing with coconut milk drizzling. In all, as good as always. I am going to finish trying all the dishes on the menu and looking forward to explore some hidden menu;
5
A very great atmosphere place to dine in. Requested for a less spicy tomyam soup but it came out to be a clear soup with chili by the side. The meat in the coconut drink is too hard to be eaten. Other than that everything is great ~
4
The restaurant was located in the row of shophouses which was just above the MRT station from the Downtown line side. The restaurant used to be located in Sembawang 16 years ago, and relocated to its current location in 2013/ 2014. A couple of years ago there was a change of owners with the menu given a makeover.Looking through the menu, one could not help but notice the uncommon dishes such as Miang Kham and Kra Por Pla Phad Hang.Yam Som O ($12+ small / $18+ medium)Pomelo Saladpomelo with minced pork, prawns and peanutsI usually avoided pomelo as it usually tasted sour to me. But here it was juicy sweet, with the meat giving it a savoury taste too.Miang Kham ($12+ small / $18+ medium)Betel Leaf Wrapthai betel leaf with dried shrimps, roasted peanuts, roasted coconut, chilli, lime, ginger and onions with a savoury dipThis dish was seldom found in the menu in Thai restaurants in Singapore, as lots of effort was needed to prepare the ingredients such as the finely roasted coconut. It was like having rojak in the mouth with the prawn paste taste, spicy chilli padi, nutty peanuts, fragrant coconut in it.Khor Moo Kurobuta Yang ($22+)Grilled Kurobuta Pork Collargrilled kurobuta pork collar accompanied with homemade spicy sauceIt looked like well charred char siew when served. It was well paired with accompanying tangy sauce.Gaeng Phed Ped Yang ($17+)Panaeng Red Curry Roast Duckpanaeng red curry with roast duck, lychees and pineapplesThe red curry was not as spicy as expected. It was rich and creamy, which made it nice to go with plain rice, with the juicy pieces of fruit giving it a burst of sweetness.Hor Mok Talay Khanom Krok ($10+/ 4 pieces, $16+/ 7 pieces)Thai Style Otah on Clayplatemackerel fish mousse with thai herbs served in traditional clayplateThe dish was served on cute looking plate which was specially ordered from Thailand. The otah was bouncy and juicy in texture, packed with juicy pieces of seafood in it.Neau Ribeye Black Angus Yang ($32+)Pan Seared Black Angus Beef Ribeye220g black angus ribeye beef accompanied with green curry sauceIt reminded one of steak served with bÃ©arnaise sauce when served, with the meat sliced into strips for easy handling. On its own, the meat was juicy and tender without overcooked. With the sauce, it was rich and creamy with a green curry aftertaste, which some may felt that it overwhelmed the original taste of the meat.Kra Por Pla Phad Hang ($14+ small / $20+ medium)Fried Fish Maw with Beansproutsstir fried beansprouts with fish maw and eggsFish maw was usually used in soup dishes, one seldom saw it in a stir fried dish. Although it was stir fried, it remained soft and spongy. Khao Phad Nam Liap ($14+ small / $20+ medium)Sawadee Olive Fried Ricestir fried olive rice with chicken strips, dried shrimps, lime and chilliThe purplish looking rice was fragrant on its own, served with sliced shallots, cubes of juicy sweet lime, crunchy dried shrimps, chopped spicy chilli padi, crunchy deep fried minced garlic. It was a party in the mouth with spicy, savoury, sweet flavours, plus the different textures.Khao Phad Talay ($18+ small / $28+ medium) Superior Seafood Fried Ricestir fried rice with crab meat, prawns and conpoyIt may looked average, but the crispy fine conpoy provided an extra pop in texture.Khao Neow Turian ($12+)Mao Shan Wang Durian Sticky Ricepremium durian mao shan wang with glutinous rice topped with sesame seedsAs Mao Shan Wang was not available, it was replaced with D24 durian puree. The durian puree was rich and creamy with taste more on the sweet and balanced off with the chewy sticky rice.Khao Neow Ma Muang ($7+)Mango Sticky Ricemango with butterfly pea flower glutinous rice topped with roasted mung beansThe mango was chunky and juicy sweet, balanced with the sticky rice, topped with mung beans which gave an extra crunchy texture.Tup Tim Krob ($6+)Red Rubywater chestnut with jackfruit, coconut flesh and coconut milkThere was lots of liao in it, such as the red colored crunchy water chestnut, crunchy sea coconut, soft strips of jackfruit, and coconut flesh. It would be best to have this as soon as it was served as the shaved ice melted rather fast.Butterfly Pea Flower Tea ($5.50+)The drink was blue in color and served with lime juice by the side. When lime juice was added, the drink changed from blue to purple in color. The drink was more like a lemonade with slight tea taste in the aftertaste
4
Staff were really patient in explaining the menu to us, even when we queried about the Chinese New Year menu next year. We ordered a stuffed chicken, which didn't quite fit our tastebuds. The rest were reasonable. Do get the 10% off chope voucher before you visit to save some cash.
5
A gem to go if you miss authentic quality thai food. Tried the signatures like Kurobuta pork collar, Red Curry Roast Duck, Tom Yum Goong, Stuffed Chicken Wings, Fried Fish Maw with bean sprouts. Everything is delicious and they will always ask your preferred level of spiciness. Boss is friendly and staff are attentive. Clean comfortable and central. Will definitely come back!
3
Ambience is great but the items are a little more pricey compared to the other thai restaurants. Service is good :)
5
Good was great, service was a little behind as it was under staff. The table next to us actually walked out because they waited too long to gave their order.
4
Visited for a family gathering. Great Thai food but a little pricey.
Portions are small but delicious, service was a bit slow as I could only see 2 waitresses serving the entire restaurant.
Stuffed chicken wings were delicious aa was the sticky rice.
4
Food is good and the restaurant service is friendly. Despite we waited very Long for our table, but they apologised and gave us free ice tea.
5
The place is well located near bugis. very elegant class renovation. food is authentic and nice. recommend porl collar and curry!
a bit expensive. we spent $100 for two.
4
This place we stumbled across in China town and it didn’t disappoint.The Thai menu was extensive and even a vegetarian can get a good meal here. Wine in Singapore is not big but you can get a decent beer whenever you go.Green curry chicken rice and some other specialty you can get it all
5
It’s been 5-6 years since the last time we came here, was not busy on a Saturday night as many new eating places have sprung up nearby, we enjoyed the pork collar, the steamed sea bass, yum Woon Sen was a bit let down, too watery, the red curry was good and the Chang beer was cold and refreshing, overall not bad at all
4
Visited the restaurant on a weekday for lunch,Although we were in a party of 11 ( reservations made 2 hours earlier) we were comfortably seated in a long table.Some of the yummy food that we ate included the Kurobuta pork collar,stuffed fried chicken wings,tom kar kai,Otah fish cake and olive fried rice.For desert we had the mango sticky rice.The taste of the food served is like us having a meal in one of the Thai restaurants in Bangkok.As the restaurant was "packed" during our visit,the 2 waitresses on duty tried their best to attend to the customers requests.The prices are slightly on the high end based on the portions served but with the fresh and authentic food we ate,it was worth paying the extra
4
The authentic Thai dishes are always very appetising and the portion are value for money. So far I brought alot of friends to patronize it and all said is good choice. I simply enjoy the olive rice, promfret fried fish, mango salad and the seafood tom yam soup. It is a pity we did not get to order the mo shan yan durian dessert as it was not available. Hope we have better luck on our next visit. Anyway my friends said that they will bring their family members back to Sawadee. It is always good to come with more people so that one can explore more other dishes and I am sure it will be just as tasty.
5
Sawadee Thai Cuisine Located at 9 Tan Quee Lan Street#01-01, Sawadee Thai Cuisine is a Thai restaurant centralised location in Bugis. its clean and modern... serving authentic Thai dishes, The food tastes great and is made from quality ingredients, I enjoyed all the food that we tried especially the Pad Thai it was outstanding .You could say that it’s one of the Best Thai Food in Singapore The pricing is definitely higher than average but I guess you are paying for the quality of the dishes served here. The true highlight of the night was definitely the food, it was absolute perfect. Big plus also go to the Staff, very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Thai cuisine. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon
4
Food was great, especially the pork collar. Staff was prompt in serving, and food didn't took long to arrive. Overall it was a satisfying experience!
4
Quite loved the food at Sawadee. The quantity was great, though i felt that Thai food is much more spicy but i guess the restaurant is also catering to those who can eat that much of spice.
5
Do try out their green mango salad, Thai coconut chicken soup and seafood (crabmeat) fried rice if you like medium spice and loads of flavor.
Vegeterian options are limited, kailan is an option.
5
We tried Sawadee over Aroy Thai which is few shops down the stretch as it's less crowded, probably due to price on the higher end. Wasn't disappointed by the quality and presentation of food.
5
A friend brought us here for dinner, and I was surprised the whole dinner experience.Nice interior - checkedGood music (thai jazz) - checkedGreat food - checkedBeautiful presentation - checkedPersonal service - checkedWhat really stood out for us was the warm and personal service. I accidentally spilled my drink and immediately this young Thai girl came over to help. Shortly after, she replaced the drink without charges. Then before we left, we asked the waitress where can we get a taxi for our Australian friends. She said she could get a taxi for us and told us to continue sitting down while she arranged the taxi. When it arrived, she even went out of the restaurant to hold the taxi door for our friends.These were well beyond her job scope. This was truly exceptional service
4
Overall was good. We ordered 8 dishes, thumb up for Kurobuta pork but steam fish have a fishy smell. Tom Yam soup is authentic, must try. We tried all the dessert, personally love Mao San Wang Durian Dessert. Lemongrass drink can be improved. Service staff was friendly but a bit inorganize. In short, it's a good place for dinner and will visit again to try other dish
4
This place offers some of the most delicious and famous Thai Dishes.The food quality and service both are good and prices are reasonable too.The best part is that they have some vegetarian options as well. Overall I would rate this place 7/10 and one may try this place if around
5
I had the pleasure of dining at Sawadee Thai Cuisine Restaurant in June 2017. We were surprised by the authencity of the Thai food and the knowledge that the owner knew about Thai food as we were ordering our dishes. The owner was nice and had a chat with us as we were paying, talking about his experiences and adventures. The food was really delicious. Highly recommend their crab curry :
4
Overall, the food quality and taste is pretty much above average. Chicken Wings, fish cake, red curry, tom yum soup, olive rice were all excellent. the dessert was a little let down though - red ruby and durian sticky rice. Not as authentic. Thai milk tea was not so sweet and very fragrant
4
Food was very good but personally felt has been tamed down as not as spicy as pure original thai food. We had to ask for extra chilli padi!Having said that food is tasty and very edible and restaurant went out way to make veg food for a kosher guest with no problem.Pineapple rice not served in a pineapple camps the appetite.Service was good friendly and attentive.I will come back and have no hesitation recommendin
5
Great food and services, Thai food authentic and Creative . Highly recommend the chicken fillet, thanks
3
Seems like the business is no longer as good as before. Reserve a table with special request but it was ignored. Food was alright. But this place is towards pricey.
4
The food was of good quality. I thoroughly enjoyed grilled pork collar, green mango salad and tom ka gai.
The taste wasn't modified to suit the taste buds of Singaporeans, it was authentic.
The price is slightly pricey though.
4
Food was served very fast. The portion is good for 2-3 to share. The prawn Tung Hoon perfectly cook with less than $30. Something not to be missed will be the olive rice. Yummmmm
5
Chanced upon this restaurant online while looking for a thai food recommendation.The food was great. Me and my friends thoroughly enjoyed the grilled pork collar, crab spring rolls, fish cakes, stuffed chicken wings, tom yum soup and olive fried rice. A Must try is the durian sticky rice as dessertService was friendly and prompt and the food was served pretty fast.All in all, we enjoyed our time catching up with great food to complement
5
Highly recommended Thai Establishment with a lovely and comfortable ambience to visit for authentic Thai food and desserts. A must not miss venue if you are looking for an authentic thai restaurant in Singapore. Came here with the family to celebrate my dad's birthday and we had the Green Mango Salad and the kurobuta pork collar as the starters. The mango salad was spicy but appetising. A great start to whip up an appetite. The Kurobuta Pork Collar was juicy and chargrilled to perfection.Next, we had the Spicy Tom Yum soup with fresh seafood, fried stuffed chicken wings which was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The Spicy Steamed Fish, Roast Duck Curry and Seafood Fried Rice as mains and we ended our dinner feeling totally satisfied. Lastly, we managed to squeeze in the Durian sticky rice as dessert as we couldnt help but notice the alluring smell of the durian from our next table and we had to give this a try. The dessert ended up being one of the favourite dish for the night as we are told that the durian puree is actually made up of real durian flesh from the Mao Shan Wang variant. Ultimately, Dad ended the night a happy man and the service staff even played a birthday song for him when they presented the birthday cake to him.I will definitely patronise them again to try out their other signature dishes
5
Having visited a few times, I had to organise another dinner trip to Sawadee Thai as my Thai friends were around in Singapore for holiday. Totally enjoyed our gathering as the ambience was great, the service staff were attentive and prompt, and most of all, we enjoyed our food. Apart from the usual dishes I ordered, we also tried the new "Kurobuta Pork collar" which is very delicious and yummy. Standard has always been consistent, their thai basil mince pork with beancurd, stuffed chicken, nicely cooked vegetable and sambal kangkong. After a few days of Singapore local delights, my Thai friends were glad that they had some "hometown" food in this restaurant. glad i made the right choice
2
Staff does not know the menu, could not explain the dishes for customer to order. Probably explained the low patronage in the restaurant.
3
Food was good - we had the tomyum soup, olive fried rice, fried pomfret fillet (crazy pricey for 3 small pieces), papaya salad, and pandan chicken. The place had an unpleasant smell (think it was coming from the straw mat on the wall). Friendly service
2
What can I say, just like the average food court, nothing special. Especially the mango salad with prawns was not good (as there were no prawns). Get's two stars because of the good staff
5
Ordered the green curry chicken, crab stick appetiser and Angus prime rib. The green curry has lots of chicken and is very fragrant. The durian sticky rice is recommended. However, service can be improved as they served the wrong dish twice.
5
Went there for a one for one deal on Chope. Nice seafood fried rice! We ordered the beef and chicken too. Delicious!
5
Came here due to the $1 chope curry. In the end, enjoyed the other dishes as well! Had the curry with crabmeat, otak on a clay plate, tom yum soup, omelette with minced pork and basil leaves. Left the restaurant feeling full and satisfied.
5
We ordered the crab meat red curry and another pork dish with 2 plain rice.
Curry was AMAZING. Would skip the meat and order another curry next time.
Plentiful crab, never seen so much crab in a curry in my life. Delicious
4
I love the chunky pieces of crab meet in the lovely curry coconut broth. The panda wrap chicken is also well marinated and crispy
5
Tried different items this time round (second visit). The roast duck curry is a really pleasant dish! Fruitiness and the aroma of the duck complement each other well.
4
Not bad. Worth the deal. People coming in and out. Full house but no q. Reservation recommended. Tried the olive fried rice and it is quite ok. Our fav is still the superior seafood fried rice.
4
I ordered the Red curry crab meat. The curry was lovely and the quality was good. Had quite a generous amount of crab meat.
5
Good food, friendly owners and staff..... the old rustic Singapore that all tourists want to see, taste, and enjoy.......not just another modern building that one can see any where in the world.
4
We had the roasted duck curry with lychee and pineapple. Sounds like a weird combination initially but it blends in pretty well as a whole. Tom yum soup was served in a interesting concept with an urn. The best dish we had was the Thai basil minced meat with Beancurd. It was really good, the Beancurd was crispy on the outside and silky Soft in the inside
4
Nice food & ambience, valued for price but service have to be improved. Bought online cash credit vouchers with 10% saving.
4
Great and authentic Thai food at a slightly pricey end. Need to give it to their ambience and the place service.
5
The food, service and ambience were good. Food presentation appetizing. However, the mung beans in the mango sticky rice were a bit burnt. The red ruby dessert delicious. Will definitely return.
5
Trust the locals, food in Singapore is great almost everywhere, yet a few places stand out. It's one of them.
5
The pad thai and olive rice was unexpectedly good! However, price might be on a higher side. But it's a wonderful experience overall!
5
I love the mango salad very much! One of the best I ever tried among Thai's restaurant! Service was really fast! I had green curry chicken which is always my favourite. The price is really worth every penny!
4
Reserve before going, slightly pricey and slow in service. tasty food with quiet ambience. good for gathering dates.
4
We were looking for a Thai restaurant in the area and we found Sawadee Thai Cuisine. The restaurant has a nice setting with a cosy atmosphere. The food is was wonderful. We had the crab rolls for starter, the vegetable with scallops, and fried beancurd with vegetables. We recommend all !!! The price is reasonable for eating out in Singapore We probably will return there with friend
5
Extremely reasonable prices for delicious Thai food which is almost as authentic as what we can get in Thailand. Was pleasantly surprised that they brought us free glasses of lemongrass to drink when the restaurant was full on a Fri night when we arrived at our reserved time
5
Brought my mum to the restaurant to celebrate Mother's Day and ordered the set menu. Food was delicious and service time was fast. The restaurant gave each dining mum a stalk of flower which I felt was a very nice touch to complete the entire dining experience.
5
The food was exceptional, Green and Red curries are fabulous and Tom Yum is fantastic!
A highly recommended place, better to book in advance.
5
The food is unapologetically flavourful; some Thai restaurants tone down the hear or sourness of their food, and end up serving half-hearted Thai food.
This place doesn't do that at all, and if you've ever eaten in Bangkok, you'd really appreciate the food here.
5
Good food, good service. A bit pricey but definitely worth it! They can cater the quantity of the food to the number of pax u have.
5
Party of 12. We ordered the festive set. The kurobuta pork was perfectly done with delicious dipping sauce. The yusheng was v special with fried pork skin and coconut.
4
We had the clear tomyum soup, red curry with crabmeat, grilled kurobuta pork &iced thai milk tea! all tasted good, especially the pork! it was grilled to perfection; really fragrant &juicy. The red curry went super well with the jasmine white rice too. tomyum soup was spicy &has a hint of sweetness from the seafood. It's hard to find such good food elsewhere that isn't laden with msg
5
the food is definitely delicious with good service, the tom yum soup is a bit spicy, if you can't take the hear, remember to inform their staffs before you order. it's better to make reservation on the weekend if you don't want to wait for a long time.
2
Overpriced & normal tasting~ Staff is not fully aware of their online promotions~ But is assuring enough to confirm that they'll call the boss to verify
5
Came here for lunch, and did not leave disappointed. Was very satisfied with the variety and the suggestions made by the waitress. Had thai fish cakes and crab spring rolls (which was my favorite). Very filling thai chicken wings, spicy tom yum soup ( recommended by staff) and the phad thai. place is full during lunch, and I am sure dinner is too. Reserving the tables before going down will be advised
5
Everything on the menu is simply awesome and the dishes look as good as they taste.Spices are balanced at perfection and the staff is kind.This is one of the best thai restaurants, and I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to discover or rediscover Thai cuisine. The value for money is exceptional as it is quite cheap (you can have a good dinner for no more than 12 or 13$)
5
Go for the olive fried rice and stuffed chicken wings. Those are pretty awesome, though the tempÃ©rature of the fried rice tends to be abit low on heat, so be sure to ask them to serve it hotter. Duck curry and Tom Yum soup are really good too. Nice setting and decent servic
5
Location is good and importantly, food is good and service is good as well. Staffs are very attentive and polite!
2
Taste of food still alright, bt price are too much , and staff at account talking, only the Vietnam girl are serving
5
This restaurant is a must try when in Singapore. A truly great meal. Delicious! Topped it off with dessert. Highly recommended
4
Food was good as usual.
Curry duck - must try
Mango sticky rice - average, mango not in season?
Olive rice and pineapple rice - excellent
5
I have came here twice so far. Once was lunch with colleagues and the other was with my family. Both occasions didn't disappoint, service was attentive, food was excellent, beautifully plated each dish was Instagram worthy I must say.
5
The place is awesome from food, services, location (100 walks from Bugis mrt station) and very great ambience, not crowded.
The price is so reasonable too.
5
Friendly service and punchy food. All good from the starter of crab meat spring roll, pomelo salad, olive fried rice and tom yum soup. The spicy steam prawns and green curry chicken didn't live up to the rest. This was made up by the mao San wan durian and mango sticky rice dessert. Will come back again!
5
I've had a lot of Thai food, but this one really outshone many other places. We had the tom yum seafood soup, red curry and crab meat, minced pork with tofu and vegetables with scallops. Of exceptional note was the red curry with crab meat and minced pork with tofu. Both were flavourful, fresh and absolutely delicious. Will absolutely be back for sure
5
I love eating Thai food, and I have been shuttling between Singapore and Thailand, Bangkok for the past few years. I rate Sawadee very highly because they balance their flavours well, their food is pretty, their service is warm and homely and they are affordable.I have tried many other Thai restaurants In Singapore but I still feel here is still the best.They rank up there with the top restaurants in Bangkok
4
The dishes are peppered with Thai herbs especially the tom yam soup (which is not overly spicy and the mango salad (though it's a tad too spicy for my taste buds. The appetizer platter is a delight ! With glass noodles, otah, fish cake, crab rolls etc. yummy ! The duck curry has a unique combination of lychee and roasted duck - though it could have been better if its gravy is not so thick. The dessert - the classic mango sticky rice did not disappoint too!
3
We were taken by a local couple. Great décor and the food was excellent, but the mains arrived before the entrees, and we only got the entrees because we asked where they were. . The service was polite but not very engaged with our table.

A simple restaurant with very good Thai food. They know how to cook, and both the service and the prices are ok as well,

Spicy steamed bass very good, tom yum soup very good, green chicken curry average, Overall very good.

Good thai food, good service. Order spring roll and tomyam seafood, very delicious. I like the olive rice most, my favorite dish. Steam fish is very fresh and delicious. Mango dessert is sweet and fresh. Value for my money.

Food was delicious, service was good. Mid-range prices and good menu selection. In Bugis area so conveniently located.

The food we ordered all were awesome. as we did the food tasting visit to this Thai restaurant, we order 5-6 different dishes and all of them were awesome!! So tasty!! My favorite was the mango-sticky rice LOL. But the chicken curry, tom yam soup, spring roll, salad and all others were very good also! The service were awesome too, the manager greets us when we were there. Recommended

My first time to Singapore and my family and I stayed in a hotel along Beach Road. I chanced upon this outlet on Tripadvisor and given the ratings, I told my wife we had to try it since we just arrived from Bangkok; and we missed the food there. My wife, Jolie is a hard woman to please (i know) and I must thank Sawadee Thai Cuisine for living up to its service standards. Upon getting off from the cab, one of the staff saw my wife struggling to remove the baby pram from the taxi's boot, the staff stood by the door unsure if we are going to enter the restaurant. But when we walked towards the door, she greeted us with a very big smile and offered to help us with our load. My wife was pushing the pram, I was carrying my baby girl, and my son was hopping around behind his mother. We were shown to our table and there in front of us were really nice black and blue plates; very fine-Thai, and they looked expensive. A Thai waitress came to take our order and communicating with her in english is a breeze. We ordered the explosive mango salad to whet our appetites, followed by a tomyum goong which they said is a must have which I certainly agree with them, juicy Beef striploin with nicely paired green curry dip, seafood fried rice for the kids, and pad thai for Jolie and myself. We were brought glasses of water (free, by the way) when one of the staff saw me trying to deal with the fabtastic tomyum soup. By the time we were done, I felt like it isn't enough and it seemed like the staff noticed it; she came over to ask if we liked to have any dessert. Thank God we ordered the durian sticky rice dessert. Jolie loves durian and she is still telling me how much she loved the durian sticky rice up till this day. All in all, Service : really attentive, tops. Food : I have never enjoyed an asian meal this much. Tasting all sweet, sour, and spiciness all at one time. Price: with this quality and service, I initially guessed that the bill would come up to be something a little more on dear side; but no, it was somewhere around $30sgd per pax. I guess they are really taking pride in what they do ,than ripping the customers off. Will be back again during my next trip to Malaysia

First time dining here with my thai friends and i am surprise by the standard of the thai food served here. Made me remember of the food back in bangkok. the tom yum seafood is spicy and sour and has generous serving of fish and prawns. overall, it is very refreshing.stuffed chicken wings are nice and juicy, mango salad was good and the bite size thai otah was good and it even came in the thai traditional claypot platenext we had the olive fried rice and crystal noodle with prawns. i truly enjoyed the crystal noodle with prawns. the aroma of the dish is very nice.lastly, we had the traditional thai mango sticky rice and red ruby for dessert. Mango was sweet and juicy. Overall, my friends and I really enjoyed our meal here

I asked my hotel Fairmont where can I have good Thai food nearby and they say try Sawadee.Wow! It is so good!!The service is good and the boss coming over few times to checking if everything is okThe food are very beautiful and taste very good. But my phone battery had finish so no pictures :(But next time I come Singapore I am sure to come again to take pictures!

Shame that the service was poor. We went there yesterday and ordered 5 dishes and each dish took at least 20-30 mins to be served. We were served green curry chicken first and the olive rice came after 20mins wait. Male wait staff was always on the phone instead of helping with the service. Dishes were not as authentic but otherwise ok.

Sawadee offers good thai food but it was not as spicy as I'd have expected. However, the food tasted good and was bursting with flavors. The ambience is very nice and inviting.
5
My buddies and I trawled the net for a place that serves decent thai food and decided to try my luck with Sawadee since i was around the area. Greeted with a warm smile by a petite thai looking waitress. The manager on duty that day recommended a 4 pax set. The tomyum soup was rich in taste, beansprouts with fishmaw done really well to my liking and the dish I loved the most was the olive rice which was rich in flavour. Overall a great and filling meal. service was prompt given there were only 3 staff. Will be back for sure

Located about 5 to 10 mins walk from Bugis MRT station, this restaurant provides good food and service. The Thai otah fish cake is interestingly prepared with each piece covered with a clay cover. The olive rice is nicely prepared, fragrant and not oily. The Red curry duck with lychee is good too. We finished off with Thai tapioca and ice cream with black sesame. Average price per pax $35

Very little taste and slow service. Classic example of a Thai restaurant without Thais working in the kitchen or serving
4
Went here based on good reviews. The seating is a bit crammed and its a small restaurant. I was greeted with an over bearing smell of durian when I sat down.All items on the menu are descriptive which is good. We had Thai red curry - (pretty good taste), coconut creamy soup - (quite spicy & tangy, okayish), Betel leaves (good, but have had better), Thai Style Otah(1st try, did not like it, tasted like soft dough) and mango sticky rice(good). The prices are reasonable and the service is efficient. Did not turn out to be as good as my expectations, but above average. 3.5/
5
I visited this restaurant a second time after an initial visit the week before and both times, I and my friends were not disappointed. The dishes we ordered, Tom yam soup, otah, beef green curry, Three flavour fried sea bass and olive rice were excellent and the prices very reasonable . The desserts were good especially the durian with glutinous rice as they use Mao Shan wang durian. It was so good!highly recommended. Easy parking along the street n next to Downtown MRT station
4
Nice and clean restaurant, wasn't too crowded and waiters were friendly. The service was fast and efficient. Highly recommend duck red curry (their signature dish) and tom khar soup in a fresh coconut. A must try is a tom yum, which is delicious, but it is quite spicy. Chicken green curry has disappointed us, it was rather bland with a very strong herby taste. In general, a good spot for friends gatherings.
5
A repeated visit to Sawadee with my Canadian friends on a vacation. The dishes ordered are my all time favourites, indeed they did not disappoint me as a host. Friend's Favourite dishes were the duck curry, olive rice, mango salad and the stuffed chicken wings. The durian glutinous rice dessert we had is different from other places, they used "Mao Shan Wang" a more premium durian with is creamier and richer. Love it!

I found this place on Trip Advisor and it was near my hotel so I gave it a try. Singapore is known for its food so there's a lot of competition. I have tried a couple of other Thai restaurants in Singapore which were not nearly as good. The food here is very authentic and packed with flavor. The hot and spicy coconut soup (Thom Yam??) is the best I've ever had and I've eaten in hundreds of Thai restaurants in many countries. The owner came to my table and we had a long conversation about the pride he takes in the authenticity of his food and his preparation methods. Great place. I'll definitely be back.

Follow the good TA reviews on this resturant as they correct . A small unassuming resturant in Tan Quee Lan St towards the east. We had booked for an early New Year's Eve dinner and were not disappointed at all. It's a relatively small place and we were warmly greeted and given our chosen table that we reserved . We opted for some of their signature dishes , green mango salad Thai fish cakes and fantastic long crispy crab spring rolls that all hit the spot. For mains we had spicy pork with bean curd, sweet and sour fish fillets with a spicy rice .All executed very well and tasted so authentic. We also had the mixed veg plus a side of their stuffed chicken wings which again were excellent. Deserts were mango with sticky rice which again was sweet , creamy and sharp a very comforting finish. The big surprise was the bill , dinner for 4 with beers came in at $150 about 75 quid.... You couldn't get this in the UK unless you were very lucky indeed. We agree 100% with all the reviews so give this place a try if you are in the area.the staff were also superb and very helpful and engaging... We put the worlds to rights with our charming waiter..happy new year Sawadee!

In a city like Singapore with so many choices this restaurant ticked all the boxes. It was clean, friendly, great food at good value. Perfect for a business lunch or quick dinner after work. We came back because the food was delicious.
4
Good food! Nice ambience! There are few unique dishes which are not usually found in the Thai restaurants in Singapore. The crab otak was superb.
Payment by credit card was accepted with reluctance. I do not know why?
4
I had the green curry beef which was had great flavour and consistency. The fish cakes were also good and came with a beautiful spicy dipping sauce.
The restaurant is also easy to get to being 2 mins walk from the MRT.
5
Good experience at Sawadee. Friendly owner that replaced my meal with no discussions as it happen in many restaurants across south east asia. Excellent customer service and great food.
A place to visit if you like Thai food in Singapore.
5
I have been based in Singapore for the last 8 years, and I find Singapore a city with so much food to offer!Sawadee has been my favourite Thai restaurant ever since I walked into the restaurant last year. Beautiful restaurant with good music, the staff is very friendly, always asking if the dishes are ok, if it is too spicy or not. My usual orders are duck curry, thai otah, olive rice, chicken wings, steamed spicy fish and the chilli prawns.The food is very good, they plate their food so beautifully. I bring all my friends and business people from overseas everytime they meet me and they all love i
5
By now we have been to Sawadee Thai a few times and as always, the place was pleasing to the eye and the food was simple and exceptional. We had the betel leaf salad, mango salad, Tom Yum seafood soup, green curry vege, green curry chicken and we rounded it off with lemongrass drinks, red ruby and mango. Attentive service and the manager/owner keeps a close eye on the running of the place - all very welcoming and makes for an exceptional experience. Highly recommended for Thai food on the island

This is the second time we are having dinner at this restaurant. The food was as yummy as the first time round. The stuffed chicken wings are a must order; what's more it has been deboned. Just thinking of it makes my mouth water.The service is good though they could have been more attentive, as in filling our empty water glasses. Could be due to them being very busy with all the tables taken. So best to maek reservations if you intend to eat here
4
Good service and excellent food in this restaurant not far from the main hotels of Marina Square. It is tucked away in the midst of cheaper eating houses, but has pleasant modern decor, efficient air-con, and is smart. Wide choice on the menu and nothing disappointed. Genuine stuff, and plenty of spice. The portions are decent so don't order too many (which we did)Had a great Tom Yum soup. A really good choice was the Betel Leaves with Thai condiments - a great idea if you like the main Thai flavours
4
The restaurant has a nice decor and varied menu. We particularly enjoyed the prawns in coconut soup, which had generous plump prawns; Thai otah (7 pieces per order), signature duck curry (go for the bigger serving), and lovely olive rice which comes with various condiments and ingredients. The sambal kangkong (spinach) wasn't as good as other Thai restaurants, mango salad was a miss, and the steamed sea bass had too much sugar in the soup base. Food arrived quickly initially, but our fish was served to the wrong table, and we waited a long time for our mango sticky rice dessert. I had to go to the counter to remind them twice, and they apologized and gave 5% discount to our bill even though I didn't ask for anything. I will return to try other dishes, since this is supposedly the second highest rated Thai restaurant in SINGAPORE on trip advisor
4
Its a pretty good place to have a relaxed lunch with family. Dont expect really awesome Thai food but its good quality. I'd rate the authenticity to be 7.5 on 10. The points are more for the variety of usually difficult to find dishes. Taste is at 6.5. I've had far better food but thats usually been inside Thailand
4
We loved the food here and the ambience as well. The staff is very good. Food was taken care of as we had our 5 yr old daughter along and she enjoyed the Thai green curry chicken. Do try.
4
Nice place! Good atmosphere, good food and very kind service. Decent prices, also for the house wine which is good.
5
I didn't think too much about the restaurant when I went in on a Fri night but it turned out to be surprisingly authentic. The flavors were very close to restaurants I'd tried in Thailand. Highly recommend a visit!

The wife and I visited Sawadee for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and were happy we did. The food was fresh and authentic. Service was good. The place was clean and the ambiance definitely had a Thai feel. It's not cheap but I felt the price was fair given what you get.If you are in the area or craving some quality Thai food, then this worth visiting. Enjoy
5
For its price, this was one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. Super reasonable and extensive, the menu was simple and primarily traditional Thai plates. The food seemed incredibly fresh and was very well priced. It is a little off the beaten path, surrounded by fun/busy local hot pot spots, which adds to the allure
5
Authentic food and taste indeed...As you enter the restaurant, you are welcome by a beautiful and radiant interior decor and design. The service was good amd the food was really excellent. Once you arrive, the aromas greet you and immediately you feel really really hungry! Highly recommend the Yam Woon Sen salad, Phad Thai, Thai Otak
5
I went there with my family. The service is very friendly, the atmosphere really good and the food is DIVINE!! Tried a lot of new dishes so tasty your taste buds will melt!! Plan to go back over and over again to try all the rest of the menu. Great experience and highly recommended place
3
This is a great restaurant with excellent for and terrific service. My wife and I ate here twice, and one of those times we both got infected with ulcer causing bacteria that caused nausea, weakness, and itchy skin for a month. This restaurant needs to improve its sanitary regulations
5
Love their take on thai duck curry. It's not easy to cook this dish and even my picky dad gave it the thumbs up. The fried fish with thai sauce, garlic chicken and olive rice are also worth a try. And not to forget our perennial favourite thai dessert - mango sticky rice! And they sure did not disappoint with a touch of special 'blue rice'. They were not stingy with the size of the mango cubes and the proportion of mango to sticky rice is just nice. Being the true-blue Singaporean, we decided to give the durian sticky rice a try as well and we're glad we did! A must-try for durian lovers
4
I came with a few friends on a weekday night and tried this restaurant at a friend's recommendation. The food was very authentic and staff were friendly. I highly recommend the olive rice and duck curry. Delicious! I made a return visit with my family on the weekend and food was consistently good but the only drawback was that the staff forgot a few orders as the place was jam packed
5
Excellent place for authentic Thai cuisine. They do not skimp on the spices, and this is one of the best Thai places in Singapore.
4
I would definitely recommend this place which serves great thaï good at affordable price. The restaurant is nice, as well as the service and they don't rush you.
5
Great service,Tasty food... try prawn coconut soup (a must do appetizer)Try their olive rice or pineaple rice with pandan chicken as wellAnd last but not least, their mango with sticky rice as dessert.Located just outside the entrance of BUGIS Downtown line MRT station @ Tan Quee Lan street make this restaurant quite easy to find..The owner welcomed us by themself, they still accept us without reservation, even if it's near closing time already. Service are excellent, waitress knew about the menu, can suggest us non spicy food made to order for my 4 yrs old daughter.I do suggest you to try this restaurant if you want to eat thai food in Singapore.The best Thai restaurant in town.Enjoy!!
5
Best Thai food in Singapore.Owner is very pleasant, and so are all the staff. We eat here at least twice a month, and we thoroughly enjoy it every time. They are consistently great at delivering high quality food at an affordable price.Would recommend this place to anyone
5
We came to Singapore the first time and by occasion passed by this Restaurant. We went in for a quick dinner and had a very good experience. We had green thai curry, crab spring rolls and also lemongrass beef. All of this was excellent food of high quality and exceeded the expectatioms by far. Location is fairly standard and can not keep up with the food.Good for a quick dinner or lunch
4
Enjoyed dinner at the nice ambience with Thai traditional food that is hidden in Bugis which previously located in Sembawang...Tried a few recommended dishes but I like the Thai Mango Salad and Stuffed Chicken the most!The olive rice and otah were normal and to my disappointment are the Roasted Duck Red Curry and Red Ruby.. Has already feedback to the owner and hope to return to try a better version.. I will go back to give other dishes a try again.
3
The food here was ok without being fantastic. We came for lunch and chose the large seafood pad Thai ($18++) and the deep fried 3 flavoured sea bass ($28++) and had tap water. The sea bass was quite decent, but the pad Thai was a little disappointing. Curiously the sea bass was served about 15 minutes before the pad Thai. Location is quite convenient: close to Bugis MRT. Also good on a rainy day as there's only a short section (crossing the road) where you get wet. Acceptable enough, but I was hoping for better
4
My parents have been living in Singapore for years - they like Jim Thompson Thai at Dempsey but it is expensive (also they refuse to give you tap water for free there?) . My mum said after we went here that Sawadee Thai food is as good as Jim Thompson but way less expensive (the wine is expensive but same everywhere in Singapore). We had the fishcakes, green mango salad, green chicken curry and tofu with chicken mince and everything was delicious (and spicy!) We had sticky rice and mango for dessert which was also nice. You can probably get cheaper authentic Thai down the street in Golden Mile but for a nice restaurant atmosphere and yummy Thai in Singapore (where good Thai is sort of hard to find) I think it's pretty good
5
Been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile now ever since many blogs rave about their dishes.We were so impressed by every single dish! We ordered their signatures like:Mango SaladTomyum SoupSpicy Steamed Fish Sea Bass3 Flavoured prawnsFish Maw with Beansprouts Olive RiceThai OtahThe girls and I ended our night with their mango sticky rice. The owner told me that they use some kind Thai Flowers (I cant remember the name lol) to get the purplish colour on their sticky rice.Mega mega love all their dishes!!Forgot to take pics of their lovely food as we were too hungry. Only got to take the dessert :(Overall full marks from us in terms of food, service, ambience, and value. We are already planning our next trip and promise I will post pics this time

This was my second time dining at Sawadee. 1) I came here first in mid June for lunch to try out the food before making reservations for a group dinner later in the month. My husband and I ordered the Pomelo Salad ($10) - after Jonas the waiter insisted it was a must try, and what a refreshing and delicious starter it was although I would have wished that the portion was much more than the 2 and a half tablespoons we each got. Next was the Thai Coconut Chicken Soup ($13) that came in a young coconut, Olive Rice ($13) served with fried chicken strips, fried dried shrimps, onions, chilly and lime and after mixing it all up ourselves, it was yums! The show stealer was the Traditional Thai Otah ($15) served in a traditional clay plate with little 'hat' covers. There were morsels of fish meat similar to the way we make otah at home, with a perfect combination of coconut and spices. After lunch, Andrew, one of the partners of the restaurant spent some time working out a set menu for our upcoming group dinner of 12 people. 2) We arrived at Sawadee in a van to find that Andrew had arranged our group dinner as pre-planned. The set menu included the following: Pomelo Salad, Fried Stuffed Chicken Wings (a bit too oily and serving of sweet chilly sauce was too little), Tom Yam Seafood Soup that was way too spicy, Traditional Thai Otah that was a favourite of all along with the Thai Green Chicken Curry, Fried Pomfret with Mango (fish was fresh and well-fried but mango topping was too little) and Olive Rice which was again very good (but I would have preferred if I had some nam pla with it). Everyone praised the quality and taste of the food and they are an international group from USA, France, Turkey, Venezuela and China. Andrew was always checking if things were going well and always open to suggestions for improvement (e.g. asking customers the level of spicyness of their dishes). Andrew helped coordinate the 2 surprise cakes that had been brought to the restaurant earlier on. The cakes were brought to the table on glass cake holders, something that I practice in my own home but have never seen done before in a restaurant. I was IMPRESSED! I give Andrew 5 stars for his charm, attitude and sincere desire to ensure his diners have a pleasant experience. I give Jonas 4 stars for trying his best to meet all our requests and I hope he will get into high gear to cope with a full house in future. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to Thai food lovers
