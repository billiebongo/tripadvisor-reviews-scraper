Good brunch at reasonable prices. Great view just by the river and beside the museum. Would go again.
4
Good food, awesome service, however it was a little noisy and slightly dark to my liking. Overall, recommended to have dinner at!
4
Had lunch here whilst visiting the museum. The food was very good, especially the burger. The staff were friendly and helpful. Just make sure you get everything you order and check the bill before paying.

We went to Prive ACM during Valentine's day. Made a reservation at 8pm and were on time unfortunately we were told that out of the 3-course meal, the 1st and 2nd course which were supposed to have 2 options became none. No more Roast Butternut Squash Soup and Red Wine-Braised Beef Brisket which we were craving for. The quality of food is average, the toasted sourdough (1st course) was a little hard to chew while the snapper (2nd course) tasted a little fishy. As for the service and ambience, it was good for us.
5
Quiet cosy despite in the midst of business district area. Good exploration within the area around. Has a children corner for them to play toys with. Overral I am pleased with this place and has been here for many times. Would recommend to friends around me
5
If you've been visiting the Asian Civilisations Museum, this is a must to round things off. Though in the same building complex, the café doesn't relate to the museum at all in terms of style. Very urban, very chic, very modern - this could have been New York. We shared the most sumptuous chocolate and pecan brownie and lychee/raspberry cupcake accompanied by an excellent cappuccino (him) and decadent vanilla milkshake (me). Great
5
Family comes to vicinity quite often. The area usually swamped with tourists.But tucked away in a corner of the Asian Civilisation Museum was Prive. Nice views. Food was excellent. Good choice of kids menu, western and local dishes. Attentive staff. Special mention to Janice. Always made us feel welcome.And we always come back! Recommended
3
Service was great. However, the pasta that I ordered (Spaghetti Vongole) was overcooked and bland.The ambience was good for family and also if you want to have a good time with friends. Suggest outdoor seating (al-fresco). Indoor may be a tad too noisy (babies, toddlers, etc)
4
Love this space, very colonial and has indoor and outdoor seating and it is by the Singapore River! Ambience is really nice! It was a nice Sunday afternoon and weather was perfect, cool and with a bit of sunshine! There were three of us and we ordered a cake, a tart and I was so impressed by the ice cream sandwich！Yummy!
4
Visited the restaurant on new year's eve hoping to catch the fireworks from the outdoor view. Unfortunately it was raining and hence we had to go indoors. However, the ambience inside the restaurant was good too. We ordered chilli crab pasta and cream pasta with ham - both dishes tasted just fine and are reasonably priced. Will visit this place again
4
We love how bright, breezy and cheery Prive at ACM looks. We also love our friendly service. The food was decent but not great. The dessert was nice though, and the coffee was good.
5
Came to visit the museum (which is great), ended up in the cafe. The carrot cake is amazing and was complemented perfectly by a delicious tea and gorgeous service. Would recommend again and again.
4
Awesome ambience with attentive staff. We got to witness a proposal and complimentary sparkles and wine by prive and well meaning guests. Quiet and good for gatherings!
5
The restaurant is a very cosy place for gathering with family and friends. The food are of good quality! My friends and I enjoyed the dinner!
4
Went here for a break while visiting the museum. Nice choice of cakes and fresh juices. Staff was very friendly.
3
I went for brunch on a Saturday morning. Tried the smores tart but it was too sweet. Was expecting cookies or filling in the middle, but nope there's only marshmallow.
5
Nice ambience and comfortable environment for a Sunday afternoon. Didn’t try the food but the cakes were decent. A good place to catch up with friends!
3
ordered the burger and the salad. totally not value for money. burger was so so, came with chips and not fries. salad was unsatisfying also.
5
The place was very cosy and very comfortable. I liked both of indoor and outdoor seats but I preferred outdoor place!. Especially, at night, the atmosphere was so lovely. Of course, the foods were nice too. I ordered one salad and one burger. It was perfect to share with my friend. Also, I loved happy hour! It was from 6pm to 9pm and you will get 50% discount for your drinks ;) I visited prive several times, and my favorite Prive branch is ACM :)
4
Just 5min from raffles place and it’s a different world at Prive ACM. A great place to unwind even if it’s 12nn during a working day. The staff were very friendly too. And definitely didn’t chase us away after our meal like how most restaurants at the CBD will do.
4
Great place for families to get a quick bite. Loads of space for kids to run around with outdoor toys and an indoor place space. Service is pretty quick, food is decent and it's decent value for money.
5
Great place for brunch on Sunday with Kids . Space outside the restaurant for kids to run around. Food was amazing
5
It’s always a pleasure to go back to Prive. It’s a cozy place, nice choice of food, reasonable service and price level. Everybody can easily find the favourite food from the menu.
3
The riverside location was great but worst Caesar Salad! Tasteless dressing and extra $4 for avocadoes which was chopped so small I had forgotten it was in there! Rip off!
1
Food average.
Service staff disorganised.
Reserved a table, but they sat my party on a decrepit sloping sofa facing into the kitchen. A real 1 star experience. Looks like they have expanded beyond their ability to manage
5
I was there to celebrate a good friendâ€™s bday. I made a rsv beforehand and we felt very much at ease due to its relaxed setting and atmosphere. The staff (a guy) was very polite and welcoming and even gifted us a slice of cake for the birthday girl! It was a pleasant pleasant surprise for the both of us. we enjoyed it:)
4
I would have to say that I am amazed by the quality of the food here. The Western and Asian food is pretty good although I would have to say that their Margaritas really need some improvement.Piece of advice, if you have a large crowd, best to book beforehand and if possible, get a table close to the windows
4
Excellent location opposite Raffles Place commercial district. You can reach the restaurant in 5 minutes yet have a vacation feel at this touristic place. We ordered chicken rice, curry risk and pasta. The Hainanese chicken rice came with a big drumstick is tasty and the dark soy source and ginger paste are tasted very authentic.
3
I've been to Prive twice. The first time was excellent - I had the laksa and my friend had a burger. We both enjoyed the food. On my second visit I had the duck leg and was very disappointed - So small it looked like a starter and not a main.Prive is in a good location. Great for looking over the river. Pick your food wisely or you to could be dissapointed
4
A pleasant cafe offering both indoor and outdoor dining option with spectacular view of Singapore River.I love the chicken rice. Its chicken is flavorful and tasty and the rice is nicely cooked with fragrant. The dipping sauces pair well with the rice.Surely will come back again
5
You can't go wrong dining at Prive ACM. Every dish we tried so far (nasi goreng, chicken rice, laksa, chilli crab laksa, salad) is impeccable with its unique flair. The crew makes the dining experience that much more enjoyable. Well done!
3
Their service was good and they had delicious salads. If you are looking for a quiet spot for lunch within CBD area, this is the place to go for.
4
Amazing Chicken wrap. Good value for money.
Great Chocolte shake!!!
Nasi Goreng seemed a bit overpriced.
Would love to visit again.
3
Pricey for local food. Western or fushion is still ok. Very crowded during lunch time. Do make reservations.
4
Came with 2 friends to celebrate the birthday of 1 of them. It was a weekday lunch. Service was excellent. Staff was friendly & helped procure a candle for the birthday gal to blow. Food is good too. Will come back again.
4
If you're planning on going to one of the museums nearby or have just been, this is a nice cafe for cakes, coffee, and lunch. The views out across the water are also nice. I've only given it 4*s as it is a touch pricey for what it is. Worth a try, but don't go out of your way for it.
5
It was a bit challenging to locate restaurant at first, but it was well-worth the search. A pity I visited just after a heavy rain shower, so outdoor seating was wet. Food was good, had chilli crab spaghetti. Not too spicy. Carrot cake worth the price, lots of walnuts. Definitely a place to visit again
3
I need a quick and light dinner before attending a talk at the Asian Civilisation Museum. This joint was there and so I decided to pop in. The food was creatively good. The service was gracious and fast. I went for the sliders and the chicken tikka (kebab style). It was tasty. The pricing was okay based on the location.Will I go there again? Maybe
5
It was my birthday when I visited and was crowded due to lunch hour peak period. We were seated at the sofa corner next to the bussing station. This outlet, like any other prive outlets, will immediately serve you a glass of cold water as soon as you're seated.The menu is different as well and mainly sandwiches, pasta and snacks. They have plenty of cakes in display. Serving is generous and a plate itself is a full meal.This is a good place to be in the afternoon since it's breezy
5
Slap at the Centre of a biz district, sits Prive. I had an enjoyable quiet delicious breakfast with a friend. Waitress is not well manner tho. She give us a stare when we chose to sit at a table which was reserved for 12noon. It was 9am and we told her we were here for breakfast
4
The food here is really good especially the pork burger. They also have a great selection of cakes. Nice place to hang out and enjoy the great city view.
3
Atmosphere was good, service were excellent but food menu needs improve as the dishes are quite limited.
4
Nice practical location with good basic items at reasonable prices... not a destination but good stop if in area
4
The food may be a little pricey but this cafe has one of the best atmosphere for a chill brunch and afternoon tea while catching up with friends and family! The staff were really wonderful and helpful too!
4
My husband, myself and our 2 teenage boys stopped here for refuelling before commencing a Sneakpeak Singapore Tour, which departed from the ACM (the tour was excellent). It is a charming cafe with lovely views of the river and a menu that will satisfy visitors to Singapore. We ordered an Oreo Cookies & Cream milkshake, a A&W Root Beer Float, a Blueberry & Almond muffin, a S'mores Cupcake and an Iced Kopi. Not particularly cheap but we were very satisfied with what was on offer and with what we had
4
Was there after 5pm and saw the indoors full but rather relaxed patrons sipping their teas and coffee. Ordered the special rendang with fried rice-awesome! From the chicken to the crackers, every bit was delicious! Had the good old root beer float that didn't disappoint. Previous trip I encountered a rather bland root beer float.Our 8mo enjoyed the corner seat very much! She had good view of what's outside, and we brought her out for short walks in between our bites. Brought her here on her 4th month and Would definitely bring her again
5
If you're looking to pair your meal with a view, this restaurant is the place to be. The lamb shank was cooked tenderly where the meat tore gently off the bone, and a mushroom pasta which was done well enough such that the cream didnt get in the way of the meal
4
This branch has a wonderful alfresco area overlooking the Singapore river- pity it was raining on the day we decided to have lunch here.Nonetheless the food (casual western) was good- especially the smoked salmon sandwich and charred broccoli salad. Didn't have space for desserts but they have an impressive cake display- will definitely be back when the sun is out
1
I've heard so much good reviews about PrivÃ© only to be disappointed.The food is a tad on the high side considering the quality is mediocre.I was most annoyed with the (add cheese @$1) on the menu for their hamburger.The hamburger costs $19. it has 2 beef patties that were a tad too small for their buns. So I requested for 2 slices of cheese only to get a bill shock when I was charged $4 for the second slice of cheese. They explained its @$1 for the first slice of the cheese which was clearly not stated.The service recovery was that they adjusted the cost of my cheese to be $1. But alas. It already left a sour taste in my mouth.I cant remember if its $16 or $17 for a plate of chicken rice. But if your standard is nowhere near the other Michelin Star Chicken Rice Restaurants in Singapore, you better not be fleecing your customers! Good atmosphere, pretty decent service but the value and food quality brings down the entire customer experience. hence, the bad review
5
My boyfriend and I decided to have desserts at Prive after having our main course elsewhere so we managed to avoid the dinner crowd. The ambience was very nice and the service? Even better. They were very prompt and attentive. I dropped my spoon and they were quick to replace it. They also went the extra mile to find out the singer for the song they were playing as my boyfriend liked it. I'll definitely be back for main course next time
5
Great promotion of free kids meal with adult meal for school holidays. It's also well supplied with toys and space. Yes over priced and not super super gourmet cooking but easy with kids, they love the kids meals and food is decent.
4
I don't know why I haven't been here before but I will now come more often! Service was a little slow yes but it was a weekend, the pace was languid, the service came with a smile and the food was good! So no quibbles, just soak in the good vibes and enjoy
4
In spite of it being crowded during lunch time (which is perfectly understandable), the reataurant was noticably understaffed. In spite of the controlled chaos, the servers were attentive and our orders were promptly taken. Table water was served, and the food came along swimmingly fast. I had a charred broccoli salad that was generous with the ingredients, and the coffee was decent. The dessert selection will leave you spoilt for choices so choose wisely (or not!) Good portion sizes, and the food selection was ample for a family-friendly place. A sweet place for a date too. Prior booking would be recommended, or just wait patiently to be served by the friendly staff.
4
Went on a Tues and Fri evening. Laksa was fantastic, and the pork slider and crab pasta were pretty good too.They have a variety of cakes and pastries. We really like the Gula maleka chiffon and carrot cake!Staffs were friendly, attentive and patience. Place uses warm lightings; cosy ambience
1
There are quite a lot of overpriced restaurants in Singapore and this place is surely one of them. We had family lunch on Saturday and ordered a classic burger and Vongole pasta. Vongole pasta was tiny portion and didn't look "freshly cooked" but still....okay. Burger was rather shocking because it looked far from being the ones you would expect from any Prive cafe/restaurants. They looked more like some cheap burgers you can find at hawker centers. I am a regular visitor of Prive Keppel Bay and I've never had any problem with their burgers but this one I must say, was absolutely UNACCEPTABLE.
5
First of all I can't understand the negative reviews about this cafe - I had nothing but a good experience.Walking into Prive without checking TA beforehand was a risky move on my behalf, but it paid off. The cafe situated in the museum is brilliant.My boyfriend and I visited at lunch and both ordered a DIY sandwich. You cannot go wrong making up your own sandwich and for $10 I'd seriously recommend it to everyone. As for their chocolate chip muffins they're served warm which is a total game changer! The best part? If you visit the museum you get a 10% discount on your food! Very good food and I'd recommend the bacon alioli in your DIY sandwich you won't regret it.
5
Was with my Wife the first time there at acm. Great place. Cooling too despite the open concept. Fast service and great food. Friendly staffs who saw my acm sticker and gave me a discount without having me noticing. That's great customer service. Thanks for making our nights out a memorable one.
1
What a joke. We dined here on Fri. night ahead of going to the theatre next door. The menu is uninspired, the food VERY mediocre but the only reason I'm taking the trouble to write this review is to say that the service was inexcusable. Far too many examples to expound upon but suffice it to say, the service was non-existent UNTIL a female 'manager' finally realized there was a problem and tried her best to rectify the situation with apologies and complimentary desserts. Her efforts were appreciated and we thanked her but at this point the meal was ruined. We won't return to any Prive restaurant as a result of this poor experience
3
Food was average. We had Hainanese Chicken Rice and the Mediterranean Seafood Baked Rice and was disappointed at the overpriced food. Ordered an Ice Cream Sandwich and was advised that it was big enough for two which we appreciated. Specifically told the staff to put the chocolate sauce at the side but the dessert came with sauce all over. As we were running out of time due to other engagements, we didn't bother to send the dessert back to the kitchen. Staff was apologetic and waved off the dessert as service recovery. However, personally, I would probably try somewhere else if i was in the area
3
This place is beautiful! The food is really nice and not expensive at all. They have toys for babies and the view i love it. The services is extremely bad, practically you have to beg the waiter to come to your table to take the order. I had for lunch a wrap and it was really good, the lemon pie also really good, the only thing i didn't like was the coffee
3
Nice place to sit and relax after ACM visit. Good pastries and good coffe. Service is a little bit slow and they should synk how they serve you. Got the pastries way before the coffee.
5
We had a nice and quiet dinner outside, just minutes away from the crowds. The view on boat quay and the Fullerton are pleasant. The menu is limited but the food is very good. Good price quality ratio. Friendly and fast service.
4
Prive is located in ACM, food was good and desserts were even better! I like the location and kids got to visit the museum after.
5
Met up with friends from Australia visiting Singapore wanting a spot next to the river, but with enough space to let the kids run around. Prive was the perfect spot to enjoy happy hour drinks while the kids ran around the park at the Asian Civilisation Museum. Food was good and the menu had enough choices. Wine and beer selection was good. Nice place if you're looking for casual drinks and dinner with kids in the Boat Quay area.
5
ASM is one of not many places in Singapore where the service is really good. I was surprised how attendive and friendly the staff is. Manager Andrei, was amazing! Food is just great! I've been there for a breakfast and really enjoyed it, and came back in the night for a late supper. This is one of just a few places in that area where you can have a chill and relaxing evening with a beautiful view at the Singapore river. Will go back there with the first chance
5
We chanced upon this joint as we were searching for lunch after a matinee at the wonderfully refurbished Victoria Theatre. It was a lovely, cool day. So we decided to eat outside. The salad and hot dog were faultless. Children's deconstructed ice cream and my lemon meringue hit the sweet spot perfectly. They carry a yummy moscato too!My son's 8...but if you have kids younger than that...they provide push-abouts to entertain them. There's also open spaces around the table for them to roam under your watchful eye
4
Alfresco experience was really awesome. No second thought to choose to dine next to the beautiful Singapore River over sun set with great company and food. Everything was awesome except that they ran out quite a number of items in the main menu and drink menu. And requested for milk with my English coffee but was acknowledged and forgotten.
3
We arrived and were looking for a chilled evening before the theatre. From the moment we ordered our drinks, nothing was easy. Firstly we had to order them 3 times and though the staff were very apologetic it continued with the food order which came out wrong! As we had to wait for a burger to be made, it meant the other dishes were cold. Overall, very average service and average food! To top it off I forgot the Prive card so no discount... overall not the best PRIVE....
3
Leaving the Museum and heading to the Zoo we thought that it was best to have lunch right there, the space is captivating. We made a first attempt to eat on the esplanade, with a lovely view of the river, but it started dripping, we ended up inside. I particularly enjoyed the Hainnan chicken that I had not yet tasted. Good service, tasty food, above the typical museum restaurant
3
We have dined at Prive Cafe and Prive Grill at Keppel Bay and the food has always been good. So we thought - "why not try the food at Prive (ACM). It must be good too". How wrong we were! The food here was just average. Prive ACM touted their Singaporean Laksa as one of their best sellers. Two of us tried the Laksa and we rate it 2/5. Prive's Laksa is no threat to Katong Laksa or the Laksa at Chatterbox. The Hainanese Chicken Rice at Prive ACM is also so-so. Rating: 2.5/5. The Curry Chicken is also just average (rating: 2.5/5). The Mozarella Cheese and Tomatoes Quesadilla is also just average. Rating: 2.5/5.Would I recommend you to dine here? With so many cafes and restaurants in Singapore, go somewhere else to dine unless the quality/standard of food at Prive ACM improves by leaps and bounds.Lastly, rating for service: 5/5. Great and attentive service from the wait staff
3
After a visit in ACM, went to Prive ACM to eat, drink and relax at Alfresco area, looking at Singapore River view and CBD skyline. Peaceful and relaxing.
If there're more vegetarian/vegan option, it would be fantastic!
4
Great ambience. Much appreciated quiet calmness. Food offering was ok, quality was good and flavours were acceptable. Just not the star of the show. A very nice spot to chill out.
4
Had an impromptu lunch at prive at my colleagues. Ordered the mushroom pasta but it could be better in terms of flavoring. Noticed other customers are ordering chicken rice and laksa which seem good. Would order that the next time round.
4
Lazy Sunday family lunch. Perfect. Something for everyone. Chicken rice was fantastic and kids enjoyed the pasta from the kids menu. Overcast on this visit otherwise would have "choped" a table outside.
5
Sit by the river sipping a chilled white wine, watch the world go by then choose from an interesting menu of freshly prepared tasty food. Service excellent, prices reasonable especially during the extended happy hours.
5
It was a chill and relax place to dine at. Service was quick and staff were warm and friendly. Food price was on the middle range. Food was great!
5
This place is located in the Asian Civilisation Museum. It is a great pit stop to have a drink or dinner. Service is great. Happy Hour is from 5pm to 8pm and there is all day brunch till 5pm. One can just relax here for a while and then proceed for work. Just opposite this place is a small bridge leading to the fullerton hotel where one can take taxis so this place has easy access.Most dishes are priced from 16 to 28 Singapore Dollars
4
Situated within the premises of the Asian Civilisation Museum, Prive is a great place to take a break and grab a bite after viewing the special exhibitions on the higher floors, especially with their wildly affordable weekday teatime promotion (50% cakes with any coffee/tea purchased). Expect asian flavours (like Pandan Chiffon with Gula Melaka) and timeless classics (like Carrot Cake) that will not disappoint
4
It was raining on the day, so we arrived slightly later than reservation time. fortunately our place was still being reserved. food was served pretty fast and service was pleasant. it could have been better if we were not being ushered to sit at the seat near the entrance/exit whereby there is strong wind as there is those air-fan placed at the entrance exit to prevent aircon from escaping or heat coming in. so it was cold
4
Went for breakfast on 3rd day of Lunar New Year. It is relatively quiet as it is still a public holiday. The ambience is cosy and I love the alfresco dining option by the Singapore River. I am sure many tourist would love this place. I ordered the Egg Benedict and it taste v nice with a slight sour zest. (They used some lemon). Bacon was slightly hard but overall it's a good breakfast, complete with superb rich long black coffee. Highly recommend it to tourist and anyone who would like good food, service and riverside ambience.
1
Under-staffed and missing orders was a constant problem. They ran out of plates because no own was washing dishes. We were so upset that we left to celebrate a birthday elsewhere because they didn't let us order their cakes and coffee.
5
Second time here and i really like the vibe here. Food is not bad, staff here are friendly and helpful.
4
love the ambience, very different from keppel bay. staff were friendly and service was prompt. will definitely bring more friends here.
4
Stopped during our expedition of Singapore to visit the Museum and decided to have a quick coffee and morning tea. The coffee was delicious and the cookie delicious. The children enjoyed a cake/cookie each. The atmosphere was relaxed with some items to keep the younger children entertained. The menu looked delicious
4
We were here for Sunday lunch. Our table outside faced the river and was pleasantly situated. Service was quick and effective and the waitress even moved a large nearby fan so that we sat in a pleasant breeze. I ordered Hainanese chicken and rice while my wife asked for a pasta dish. Both were served in good time and were well prepared. Despite recent negative reviews I have no hesitation is rating this cafe Very Good and one we will dine in again
1
We sat down outside on a sunny Saturday afternoon hoping for a quick late lunch, but we got a comedy of shambolic service that felt like a Laurel and Hardy movie.After trying to ordere a thickshake for my kids and a fruit juice for myself, we were told there were no milkeshakes or fruit juices, so we ordered a bottle of mineral water, after waiting 30 minutes (and getting our food), we were told the bottle of water would be another 15 minutes at least, so not surprisingly, we cancelled the order, and again not surprisingly, it was still on our bill at the end, when i went up to pay the bill, the cashier was standing beside at least 20 bottles of mineral water - so i have no idea what was going on...I tried to order the chicken rice, i was told they were all out, so i order the quesadilla instead, the rest of the groups meals arrived promptly, mine came 20 minutes later.All up it was a chaotic dining disaster. we wont be back. so many other great places to eat nearby
4
Lovely riverside setting near a grassy lawn and the beautiful ACM. Service is a bit slow but it's well set up for kids. Food isn't amazing but it's reasonable cafe food and the kids set is good value and sure to satisfy any fussy kid. Staff are friendly but over worked.
5
This pleasant, airy cafÃ© in the Asian Civilizations Museum offers an excellent selection of dishes in a thoroughly charming atmosphere. Service is friendly and attentive and the nonya dishes are particularly tasty and enjoyable -- chicken rice, laksa, chicken curry. There is also an excellent selection of desserts. The outdoor seating area on the water is charming and there's copious indoor seating also for those who need a/c. Prive ACM is a true haven of tranquil eating in contrast to the more frenetic other options in the area
5
I love the coziness of the place. The environment was really nice being located within Asian Civilisation Museum and next to the Singapore River. On a cool day, dining outdoor will be a nice choice. My visit was indoors. I had a chicken wrap and it was well packed with healthy ingredients. I had been here in two other occasions and the food never disappoints. Their cakes are impressive and yummy. Most importantly, service was prompt and staff attentive
5
I will like to thank the service team for their attentiveness and awesome service and also the kitchen team for the well-prepared food, and also the dessert plating which i specially requested for my girlfriend. Worth the money spent on this restaurant, will definitely come back!
5
A fine selection of cakes and tea, peaceful atmosphere, awe-inspiring views of the city and canal. Excellent service. Had to come back a second time when needed time out from sight-seeing.
5
The food is good and value for money. Their Service is excellent too. The Atmosphere is good and quiet.
3
Had a chef's salad on a fairly small & cramped table. Lunch hour packed by Raffles Place office crowd with the talk & din level close to shouting to be heard. Warm because the doors were open on a hot humid afternoon.
1
I had a most unsettling experience at lunch today. I'm not complaining about the food. It was adequate except for a chicken curry that didn't taste authentic and had undercooked potatoes. The interesting part was when I went to pay the bill. I noticed I had been billed for Caesar salad with chicken. So I said that my Caesar salad came without chicken. At this point the waitress who had taken my order insisted that it had come with chicken. And I maintained that it had not. Then comes the best part. The waitress then said let's go to the table and ask (the rest of my group). When she went to ask, my friend said emphatically that there was no chicken in the Caesar salad. The waitress then gave up insisting that there was and my bill was adjusted accordingly.No apology was given by the waitress or by the supervisor/manager type who was handling the till. The most curious aspect of this incident was that the staff were prepared to believe my friend and guest, but they were not prepared to believe me. In effect they were implying that I was lying to them. I find that quite incredible. Previously I just thought Prive was a so so cafe that I patronized when I didn't want to brave the lunchtime crowd in Raffles Place. Now I think Prive really has to teach its staff better manners. And maybe the chef could use a better quality of curry mix and learn to boil potatoes.
5
We were here to visit the lovely,Asian Civilisation Museum,with the intention of a Coffee/Cake treat afterwards. All went according to plan. Except, the Museum Coffee Shop,was indeed the delightful Prive ACM. The menu looked great,but we stuck to the plan. Excellent selection of Cakes in a bright airy surrounding and good friendly staff. Nice afternoon
4
We dined here on a Sunday evening and the restaurant's ambience was lovely and serene, a huge difference from the weekday/daytime hustle and bustle when the office crowd comes through. It was a lovely dining experience facing the river as the sun was setting and the city lights started to pop up all around. Food wise, both the burger and pasta that we had were great, not spectacular in any way, but delicious nonetheless. I noted that the beef rendang roti John has been removed from the menu. That's a bit of a shame and am really hoping they will bring it back sometime. Service was attentive and friendly too. I can also see this place as a great family restaurant during the day
3
We had a nice lunch after visiting the Asian Civilization Museum. The menu is a mix of western and local signature dishes, like laksa and chicken rice. The seafood laksa is lemak and delicious. Seats are indoors or alfresco, by the Singapore River, which provides a lovely setting. Great place to bring overseas visitors
4
Love the nostalgic "kampong" feel the place has to offer. Aside from the usual cappuccino, they even has the option of local "kopi" in the menu, served with ice gem biscuits! Would be perfect if they offer the rest of the menu as brunch instead of starting 11.30am onwards.
5
We ate at Prive ACM two weekends in a row. We chose outside seating right along the river . Staff was excellent , great service . We had salads both times and they were super good . Desserts are also fantastic . Prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend the setting, food and great service 
4
It is my 2nd visit to the restaurant within a week's time and this is a place I like to go for business lunch as well as weekend tea place in the afternoon. The only complaint is the size of the thick bacon is getting smaller nowadays.
4
Conducive for family and friends catch up. Food was served quickly and tasted good. We ordered the pasta and burger.
4
Coffee is good, mostly European food but they do feature different local specialties. Great views of the river and free water..
3
The location, the building and the interior are good. The food is tasteful, but the price a bit high. It is Singapore and for cheaper food you probably just have to go onto the streets.
1
I had their curry chicken which tasted like it waa reheated . Curry tasted diluted and was bad. . Honey fig ice cream was good though and sizeable
4
Right on the Singapore River, and outside the Asian Museum, this is a wonderful place to relax, take a drink and enjoy the sites. But take care, this place is not cheap. We took 2 bottles of sparkling water and an orange juice and the cost was 14.80 Singapore Dollars - and that was at a discount because we had paid to go into the Asian Museum

Our first night in Singapore - enjoyed a meal here eating outside on the banks of the Singapore River. Main meal was good. There were not many dessert selections available (maybe because it was a Monday night). Sitting outside and enjoying the lights of Singapore was a highlight.Staff were friendly and helpful

Great location at the banks of Singapore river with view of Boat Quay You can relax in comfortable lounge chairs under the trees and enjoy different delicious food.. You have to try the local Laksa - it is very tasty but spicy. The coffee is great and the Chocolate cake is fantasticThe service is a little slow when you sit outside

Great central location at the banks of the river; Wonderful view over the city / river / little green park.We went there several times to relax and recover after strolling through the crowded city center. We truly enjoyed sitting in lounge chairs shaded by large trees.Food is delicious, too: Fresh and modern small dishes like salads, quiche, sandwiches, and pastries.We would definitely go there again

Not knowing where to go during the weekend that has less crowd and a nice spot for a chill out and catch up with your friends?! PrivÃ© at ACM is the location to be. Right by the Singapore River and the amazing view of the sky scrapers. To my surprise the surrounding bars are all jam packed and finding Prive was like picking up gold bar hopping style. No queues, no waiting list, relax, chill and good service.Will definitely go there again

waiting time for the food very long. Actually wait for a main course over 20 mins still ok, but... I order a cake, the cake just place in the showing case fridge, also need over 10 mins, I was quite disappointed. the food taste just s oso, the texture of of the Curry chicken sauce like a water/soup, chicken no any taste. My husband's mushroom pasta, he said it was not very nice too.For the cake, we found a piece of hair in-between the ice cream and the cake... But the staff are nice too, due to all these happen, they gave us a free drinks dessert

Their milkshakes are to die for. Food is average but price is reasonable in this part of the city. They do have daily specials and also all-day breakfast. Weekday lunch hour is very crowded.

Located in the newly renovated Asian Civilisation Museum and by the Singapore River, this cafe serves good and reasonably priced food, perfect for causal dining. Definitely the best museum cafe in town!
5
Tasty light meals and sweets in a great location (I have been there several times). I like to sit indoors as well as outdoors. Very friendly staff. Given the location this place is a bargain.

Prive ACM is just the right place for a business or leisure meeting venue.
Nestled in a museum with the view of iconic Singapore River. It's both relaxing and reflective.

Brought my friends who were visiting SG and they all loved the ambience and view. The service was friendly and attentive and as usual, food was great as well.

Place to go to for some quiet after work drinks. Great to people watch on the other side of the river.

Love the location, so much more accessible than the one at Keppel though the one at Keppel comes with stunning views of yatchsFood selection of the menu wasn't that impressive for lunch. A lot of sandwiches, wraps, mix of brunch menu that last till 5pm, salads, pasta and nothing too heavy Wait-staff don't seem to know their menu / not paying attention while taking orders. Both who attended to us couldn't catch our orders and we had to repeat ourselves Ordered the pasta bolognese and classic eggs Benedict. Simple food yet couldn't prep wellThe pasta had to be sent back cause the spaghetti wasn't cook. No it wasn't al-dente it was pure uncooked and the pasta purée was too diluted and soupy Eggs Benedict didn't look too appetizing but tasted decent. Eggs weren't as flowy Verdict is, it's a good hangout place but don't expect the food to be goo

Prive offers great ambiance and a relaxed atmosphere to spend some quality time with friends. Great views of Fullerton hotel, Boat Quay etc. There is seating outside and inside as well. Lots of open space. They have some riding cars and tricycle etc to keep kids busy. We celebrated our friend's bday there. They played music for us. Great experience.

This is a great place to eat after you visit the asian civilisation museum. Although it has a model menu try the ' make your own sandwich' . Really great. Also the Mango and chia seed pudding ...hmm yummy Pla ce gets busy at lunch tim

We had lunch at Privé @ the ACM after seeing the exhibition. The Caesar Salad with chicken was rather tasty, served warm. The chicken is done with a lovely Masala spices. Very filling and tasty.My partner enjoyed a "DIY" sandwich.Two nice slices of cake (carrot for me, caramel cheesecake for my partner) and Kopi for both.Service was friendly and attentitive without being "in your face"

Portions are small and and it was a disappointment not to have fries served with our burgers. They serve crisps instead.
5
Good ambience and good food at a reasonable price. Good variety of food. Perfect for catching up with friends.

Was there for afternoon coffee. The café was not very well ventilated and as a result the kitchen smell filled the seating area. Ordered a red velvet cake but the red looked brown. The waitress was kind enough to offer an exchange. We got the blackforest cupcake instead. Unfortunately the cherry on the cupcake also looked brown and the cake was quite hard. I suspect it must have been sitting in the display shelf for quite a while. The coffee was decent though

We went there to celebrate our friend's birthday. There was nothing outstanding about the food and the service was nothing to shout about. Some of us ordered the mushroom soup and a main course. Our main course came together with the soup. How disappointing! Would I celebrate my birthday there? The answer is no

Brought the kids here for a visit to the ACM and decided to have lunch here. I ordered their Sambal Prawn in Tomato Sauce Pasta. The serving size is reasonable and it came with 5 prawns. It's not cheap with a price tag of $25 tho. It's spicy with enough kick but a tad salty, perhaps the Sambal gave it the salty overdrive. During this June Hols, kids eat for free with every paying adult meal. That is a good deal!!!I guess I won't come to eat here purposely but with the kids deal, it is not a bad place at all to Makan

After an interesting exploration of the exhibits at the Asian civilization museum , this is a cozy place to rest your tired legs. Great place to chill overlooking the Singapore river.However the flat white was too acidic for my liking. Try other drinks I suggest.

This Prive has a very lovely location at the river, and a lot of seating space is actually al fresco. If you are there on a a day when we have cool weather in Singapore, it is actually very pleasant to be on the terrace, and enjoy the sunset. Dining al fresco is probably a very personal preference but if you like it, this may be suited to your taste. If you do not want to sit outside, I find that the interior is slightly difficult to appreciate. It is a little like dining in a nice coffee shop, with seats placed very close together. I would not mind this casual ambience, in fact it is quite quirky and fun but it is not quite ok when the food is priced so high. The food was just average and overpriced. The service was somewhat snooty, which did not make the high price for the food any more acceptable

Nothing beats an overpriced slice of chocolate cake ($8 for a piece of cake plus 10% 10% service charge and 7% GST for a grand total of $9.40) and being treated like you are dirt in the restaurant .That was my experience at Prive ACM. First, you go into the restaurant and find yourself a place to sit because nobody cares to welcome you.Then you look around the display or wherever you can find some sort of explanation to figure out what you want. Again, not a single staff is bothered to ask whether you are being helped because they are too busy cleaning their plates or making coffee. No, their job scopes probably do not include pleasing the customers. Then you go up to the service counter to order. The service staff will pretend to take note of your order and then ask whether you are a dine-in or take-out customer. If you say dine-in, he will say "sit down and someone will serve you". That is, AFTER you have blurped out your entire order like an idiot.Next, you find yourself a seat hoping someone will come. Service staff zip around like flies but as usual, not bothering to even lift an eyelid on their customers. Try flagging the buzzing flies and they will tell you to "wait!". Try flagging a few more and with luck, you catch the right staff who is willing to take the order. Have plenty of patience because the staff have none.A simple pre-cut slice of cake takes 15 minutes to order and to be served when it could have been served right away without stressing the customer out.Try asking for additional plate or utensils. They comply (at least they get something right) but expect no smile. Smile is quite expensive here because they are "too busy" to smile. Lastly, pay 10% for the lousy service and don't complain because it's part and parcel of the F&B service in Singapore.I was hungry and Prive was the only food source available inside the ACM Museum. Will I go again? Will I subject myself to this torture and pay for overpriced food? Will you? Bring your own snacks to ACM next time please

We really enjoyed our visit to the Asian civilizations museum; on a Friday evening it was almost empty. We had a late dinner when the museum closed at 9 PM, and we should have been warned by the amount of noise coming from children in the restaurant, but it looked like it had a nice view with outside tables on the terrace. The view was great, but we were seated right in front of the music system speakers, better than the screaming kids inside, but still not pleasant. The waiter seemed completely distracted and abrupt, impossible to flag down. Ask for mustard he said yes and never came back. I think these were the most expensive hamburgers I've ever had – they were good, but $27? Stale potato chips and a tiny token of salad on the side. The waiter was prompt when it came to taking her money – $88 for two burgers a glass of wine and a coffee

Spent mothers' day there for dinner with kids and it's a great location with good space outdoors for children to expand their energy! Certainly a great location being right at the Singapore River and facing Boat Quay.Food wasn't overly great for the price you pay. Ordered the oxtail dish and sent it back twice because the meat inside was cold. They didn't quite seem to get it right even after 2 attempts and service recovery included complimentary soup and salad plus they eventually waived that dish off the bill.Kids menu is great and certainly will keep the tods happy and satisfied!Oh, and worth mentioning that they do have an indoor play area for children while also providing little rides outdoor to keep them busy! Thumbs up for that!Would return for evening drinks and the view
