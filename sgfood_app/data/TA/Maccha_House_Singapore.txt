Tried the lunch sets (Chicken Udon and Beef with onsen egg in cream sauce) and were disappointed.
The taste of the green tea drink that accompanies the set was significantly diluted by ice.

The matcha tasted pretty good but the main course was just average. Price is pretty reasonable though. The location is good as one get to sit right next to the Fountain of Wealth where there's a Pok√©mon Gym.

Their signature item is this uji maccha tiramisu (not just the maccha tiramisu) and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a must try. Smooth, creamy with perfect maccha flavour in a wooden square box and served with a small cup of tea. The maccha latte was not as hot as it should be; the service was indifferent - It felt like the wait staff were wondering why you were there! The maccha ice cream was not creamy enough. Generally a disappointment except for the redeeming uji maccha tiramisu!

Just opposite Tokyu Hands at 313 Orchard this is another place for a quick lunch. They have a good selection of lunch menus with chicken, beef or katsu and udon. Green tea desserts including their Macha Tiramisu. Had their chicken teriyaki with eggs, coming with rice, miso soup, salad and a tiny bean jelly dessert plus hot or cold tea for less than $15. Reasonable

Came here once an hour before their closing for some matcha drinks!We ordered two iced matcha lattes, one was a float and one came with a scoop of match ice cream. Prices are very reasonable for the drinks and they were really good too! Rich in flavor and very enjoyable.The matcha 'tiramisu' wasn't worth it though, it was okay, made very simply with rice crispies layered with cream cheese and matcha but it was far from an actual tiramisu and wasn't worth the price.Service was good, staff were attentive, friendly and very quick

While most people come for Maccha desserts, I've always enjoyed their neat little lunch sets and the quiet ambience away from the central shopping area at Somerset. Located next to Tokyo Hands, this eatery is large enough for the lunchtime crowd which usually comes after 12.30 so it's good to come about noon. My favourite has always been the rice with beef which comes with a soup and salad. Today, I had the onion pork rice set which came with a lot of pork slices, would have preferred more onion, though! There was a small dessertful cup of glutinous rice balls with red beans, set costing $10.99, weekdays only and a drink at 20 per cent off so had a Cappuccino. My friend had the beef bowl with a maccha drink, plenty of beef slices too. Notice that they do change their menu every now and again, so you can always try something new. You may help yourself to the water at the counter and pay there yourself as they don't have a lot of wait staff like most Singapore establishments these days

Maccha house is most certainly the place you would want to swing by to quell your matcha cravings. From the traditional matcha offerings to soft serves to new fancy matcha dessert twists, you will not be disappointed by the authenticity. A sure sign is the number of Japanese patrons who flock by! Indulge in the main courses too if you are up for it. The portions were plentiful, and were served relatively fast.

What a nice maccha themed restaurant.Many items in the menu come with maccha or finely ground green tea powder.Overall, you will be overwhelmed with matcha aroma, color and taste especially with the drinks and desserts. Hot drinks, cold drinks, sweets and parfaits. But I'm not complaining.From their wide selection of salads, rice bowls, ramen and udon, I can recommend the following: Omelette HAYASHI plate and Chicken Yuzu soba. Both the beef and chicken are tender and tasty. The meal is not light and can surely satisfy one hungry person.But there will be enough space for dessert, of which I have tried their maccha cheesecake. It's a no bake cheesecake that has a creamy goodness from cream cheese and maccha powder. The rice crispy though is quite strange for me. I can do without it and still like the maccha cheesecake. Another dessert is anmitsu which is traditional Japanese dessert made of cubes of jelly, anko, fruits, cherry and maccha ice cream.Due to this large menu, I will definitely be back for more Maccha goodness.

If you like Matcha (Japanese green tea) then this cafe is worth visiting after a big shopping binge (it's located inside Orchard Central near Tokyu Hands). Everything is matcha themed. I had a traditional Japanese dessert called an mitsu as well as a bowl of matcha tea. There is also matcha soft serve which my daughter enjoyed enough, but my mother didn't enjoy the matcha cheesecake in a jar. Service was fast enough and price was OK. It's probably more an average dining experience but I did enjoy the menu choices and matcha theme so I give it 'Very Good'

I went looking for this place because I don't mind a Matcha now and then. It was worth the search because it's offerings are so very cute. Look for it and enjoy, it's the nicest place for a Matcha I've seen here.

One of the Matcha hopping cafe, we tried the traditional matcha using a bamboo whisk and tea bowl. New experience, the matcha taste bitter so it will be best to go with some sweet stuff. Overall quite satisfied with it
3
Never tried their mains before as I was only interested in the matcha desserts here. The matcha soft serve is a wonderful "snack" to have and another I would recommend is the matcha tiramisu.

This restaurant had pretty average main courses, but I enjoyed the drinks and desserts that were served. I thought that the pair set was a pretty good deal, as it provided a S$10 dollar discount from the total bill (After GST) when you order two main meals, two drinks, and a dessert. What earned this place an average rating was the sub-par service. The waiters look disgruntled, and do not really pay attention

Whenever it comes to green teas, Nothing beats maccha drinks here! How i wish they will offer - free flow next time! It is really really addicting i swear!! You will always be satisfied with all the food in maccha house - ramen, terriyaki, udon sets, etc, your buds will be happy before you leave. Its my nth time there and will definitely recommend this. Coming back to this resto is a must. ‚ò∫

We visited the Maccha House at Orchard Central, as this was the nearest branch in our location. The location was B1-39. There were few food shops in the area. However, I chose to dine-in here as I love any types of matcha.The ambience was not that cozy as the area looks like a food court. Service was okay. Staffs were rushing taking orders. Maybe, because it was lunch time. However, there were only few diners.As I mentioned above, I love matcha! I quickly ordered their canap√©s dessert set before ordering my main course. I love the photo of their canap√©s dessert set. It was mouthwatering.My friend and I ordered:*Mentaiko Carbonara Udon w/Onsen Egg*This was an Udon in mentaiko-infused cream sauce with bacon, parmesan cheese and an onsen egg(I ordered this. I loved how nice the aroma of the carbonara. Taste was good too. A must try dish!)*Spicy Beef Inaniwa Udon*Inaniwa-style soup udon with beef slices served with a spicy twist(My friend ordered this. She said it was nice and the portion was big.)*Traditional Maccha (Hot & Cold)We love their traditional maccha drink both cold and hot!*Maccha House Canap√©s Desserts Set*Matcha Tiramisu, red bean matcha pudding, nama chocolate, matcha soft serve ice cream, and Mont Blanc roll(This dessert set was fantastic. I actually eaten this first before my main course. The set is highly recommended to all matcha lovers. A must try!)Do come by if you are in Orchard area. This place is highly recommended for those matcha lovers like me.

If you're a maccha lover like me, you'd want to visit this place. Great location, nice ambiance but staff are average (needs more training). We ordered two bento sets which were disappointing to be honest. One was too salty and the other was too kopitiam-like. However, the deserts saved this visit. We ordered one soft ice cream, parfait, and their famous tiramisu. Nice presentation and did not disappoint. So if you are around Orchard area this can be a nice place to kill the time but skip the mains. They only look nice on their display box

I came here for dessert, so I only ordered Matcha Parfait. It came with a milkshake glass. On the top was matcha ice cream with chocolate syrup and green tea mochi, it has a rich flavor of japanese green tea. The next layer is vanilla ice cream and cornflakes that blend matcha flavor very well. Overall, the taste was okay. This place is definitely for matcha lovers

I went to this place because I would like to eat Japanese food for diner. It took a very long time before someone came to me for my order. The food was quickly prepared and without a word/smile they gave me my food. When I was finished I had to wait (again!) a very long time before I could order a dessert.When I wanted to pay, I just went to them. Otherwise I had to wait again. When I wanted to pay there was something wrong with my creditcard, it is a pity that the employees barely speak English; they couldnt even explain what was wrong!I do like the food, but the service is just terrible! I would never come here again
