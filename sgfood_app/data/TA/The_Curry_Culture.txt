This place is definitely a one time visit in case you really have some cravings for Indian food .. outside sitting is definitely worth every penny.
Food tasted ok, certainly can look more healthy, with limited options for vegetarian choice. May not visit again ..

We were very much looking forward to our visit to the Curry Culture, and weren't disappointed. Food and service were both excellent - I had the stuffed prawns and my husband ordered the rogan josh which was delicious. A great location, with fairly priced food, with a nice vibe both indoors and outdoors. Well worth a visit

Well, I often wonder if a place with so many good reviews, and inside the top 20, within walking distance, dare I say, a stones throw from our hotel, lives up to the great reputation.I must say, yes, Curry Culture emphatically does! I don’t usually write a review so soon after eating, but this is really worth the credit.The service was exemplary, not hassling, but advisory and there when required, always without exception.Drinks were served almost immediately, and popadoms with relishes brought out without asking.Starters were great, including a complimentary taster of the specialty dish, which I cannot recall the name, but was very tasty.Mains were delivered to perfection, and the Butter chicken had my daughter raving that this was the best curry that she’d ever tasted. But at 16, some could be forgiven in thinking that a little over the top, but alas, I had to agree with her. This was the best I’d tasted too. My wife’s prawn dish was very full of flavours, and excellent too, as was the Aloo Gobi and accompanying Naan breads, Pilau rice and paratha. If I had to say, or suggest any minor improvement, then I’d recommend perhaps the use of cloth serviettes or napkins.Overall, I have to rate this as one of the best restaurants that I’ve visited in the past several years, and my wife and daughter would agree. It is perhaps slightly more expensive that the average, but well worth it. I’d recommend arriving before the end of happy hour, so you can have a drink before eating, whilst reviewing the extensive menu.If someone can say for sure that there are 10 better restaurants in Singapore, then I’d be amazed, and I would wish to visit one of those tomorrow or Thursday, so please message me ASAP

One of the best Indian restaurants I’ve ever been to. The food is damn close to perfect, the staff is friendly and very professional. The price is on the higher side, but you get what you pay for, and Curry Culture is worth every cent.

Thanks to Trip Advisor we discovered the Curry Culture during a recent stopover in Singapore. Incredible Indian food and an excellent host, we will be sure to visit here every time we return to Singapore.Lovely samoosa starters, fantastic butter chicken, and a lamb vindaloo to blow your socks off. Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu

Excellent food. We ate tikka masala, butter chicken, two mango lassis and shared one rice and one naan bread. Whole set cost nearly 100 dollars so bit pricey for main course, bread and drinks. Although food was best we ate in Singapore so that compensates prices. Service was good
4
Good food, good location and ambience. Friendly and helpful staff. You may want to tone your spice dial down as the curries are potent
5
Arrived in Singapore off a cruise ship from Hong Kong and had time for a lunch and a dinner only.We came upon this hidden gem while walking. The food was exquisite ,fresh,beautifully presented and the service was perfect. Our dinner was a 10/10 here.A busy wee place where you can eat inside or outside and enjoy lots of people watching.The price was reasonable for a Central City location 
4
Not inexpensive--though nothing is in Singapore. As inexperienced Indian diners, we were walked through a wonderful evening of curry dishes, as well as an interesting political discussion with one of the managers. Optional outside dining on a terrace of multiple restaurants. Would visit again

I was last here for New Years Eve 2017 and had a fantastic meal, but I never thought I'd be back here so soon. I stopped off in Singapore for 2 days after a holiday in Thailand and my first thought was to get myself over to the Curry Culture as soon as possible. We arrived late at the restaurant, about 10pm, and it was almost empty. We ordered two tandoori platters, one vegetarian and one for meat eaters, saffron rice, kashmiri naan, mango lassi and fresh lime juice. As with our last visit the food was very good, the only downside was as we were the only customers they slowly began closing the restaurant. We rushed our meal as we felt a bit guilty about them having to stay open only for us, so we didn't enjoy the meal as much as we did last time. Maybe we will be back in 2019 ?
3
The outdoor seating area has good atmosphere but the food quality was uneven. The tandoori chicken was tasty and moist but the portion was very small. The so called whole chicken was so small that it must be malnutrition. The butter chicken was average compared with much better offering from some of the cheaper Indian restaurants I've been to. The lamb dish tasted heavily of raw chilly powder instead of nicely cooked spice. However, the spinach with cottage cheese was reasonably good. The food was quite expensive but the service was excellent with very friendly staff and prompt service
3
The food is decent. Not the best Indian food in Singapore by any means but itâ€™s tasty, the restaurant is clean and the staff are pleasant. Prices are relatively expensive for curry and the portions are a bit small - but jacked up prices are a given for the area. Conveniently located. A short walk from Somerset MRT.
4
Same as before. Extremely consistent. Food is very very good and staff are even better. Place is clean and the quality of the food is excellent. Highly recommend this place
5
We read great reviews about this restaurant so we decided to give it a try! Am I glad we did! We didn't have reservations, but they were able to accommodate us right away. If we had showed up about 20 minutes later, we would've had to wait as it was quite crowded.We ordered the butter chicken which was absolutely amazing!!! The masala chicken was also very good! We decided to order the unbelievably delicious jug of mojito which came out to about 6 glasses! My only complaint is, the meat/curry orders do not come with rice. You have to pay separately. The naan was also amazing and they charge by the individual piece. The Curry Culture is a nice restaurant, on a nice outdoor street with other restaurants and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying it!
5
We went here from the reviews of the butter chicken and they are TRUE - AMAZING!!!!! We dined inside as it was so hot at lunch time, but outside had more atmosphere. We started with the samosas which I would pass on - the pastry was too thick, but OMG....the butter chicken and naan bread just melted in my mouth.....oh WOW!!!! The flavours were AMAZINIG!!!!!! The best butter chicken and naan bread I have ever had..... YUM!!!!! It is more expensive than food courts, but I would pay the extra cash for these flavours....
4
The food was excellent. It tasted just like home made cooking to us. Well cooked and lovely presentation.The staff were extra attentive. Wonderful dining experience with great customer service and festive ambiance
4
We had a very good dinner at that place. We are no connoisseur of Indian cuisine but the dishes we had were delicious. The staff was friendly and we had a lovely extended chat with the manager
4
One of the few places in Singapore serving authentic Indian food.Strategically located and excellent service.Indian food tasted better with great service and the team does a fantastic job.Do try the set lunch meal - great value for mone
5
We are away from home from the last 10 days and want to eat the typical delhi food this restaurant helps us in this awesome staff awesome place
5
This is a indian Restorent where we can get very good north indian veg food with good taste and quality service is also good
5
My husband and I ate here twice during our week in Singapore. Both times we were greeted with excellent and friendly customer service. The food is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend eating here, even if there is a bit of a wait for a table, it's never a long wait
5
My husband and I had dinner here on Christmas Eve. The staff was super friendly and the food was delicious. Definitely get the butter chicken with the garlic naan and the chicken samosas. The location is outside with a lot of other restaurants but curry culture was the only one with a wait. Always a good sign. Highly recommend if you are in the orchard road area of Singapore.
5
Sandeep and his crew are truly attentive. Right from the moment I called to make a reservation to the point we arrived there and had dinner, the team is unbelievably attentive but not too intrusive. A few must eats - the seekh kebab, aloo paratha and ask for the home made chicken curry.
5
The staff here were wonderful attentive, talkative, proud of their food and helpful. They were only surpassed by the food, wonderful food
4
Very popular Indian restaurant. They serve some really yummy curries. You can tailor the spice level to your liking by telling your waiter. The Butter Chicken and Tandoori dishes are lovely
4
I went to The Curry Culture on my birthday lunch with my boyfriend. We called around 2:45 pm to make a reservation for 2 ok and the staff member was really helpful even with the kitchen closing at 2.30pm. They gave us a nice table outside. The food was beyond amazing! Everything was really well cooked and the flavors were just amazing! Staff ir very helpful!! Just a little bit expensive..
5
The place is in the middle of Cuppage plaza, on the side of Orchard road. So you would expect a tourist trap. Nevertheless, it was one of the best curry places in Singapore and they take great pride in their dishes and cooking. I loved the fact I could sit outside on their sheltered terrace in open air with no airco for once. I had palak paneer, kofta, baingan (aubergine), thin and crispy butter naan, dhal makhani and bombay alloo. All were done close to perfection, with right amount of spicing to your taste, consistent sauces, properly cooked, etc. Frankly only marginally below the top Indians I have been to in Singapore, but at a third of the price. Ideal for couples, for business as well as for a quick curr
4
Food was nicely spiced, service was quick and helpful. Would visit this place again and vaan recommend to others. We were here midweek and got table easily but on Friday place seemed to be full and people were waiting for tables. Would recommend making reservation during weekend
4
Tried here on our way back to the UK. Spoilt for choice with curry houses where we live so happy to report that this met the standard. Butter chicken and lamb saag both very good, nice rotis. Tandoori chicken on next table looked great tooBhajis and dips went down well and 2 for 1 on the Kingfisher kept the bill under 100$ but you will need refreshment in the humid atmosphere of Singapor
4
This is one place you can try for Indan Meal .. we tried kebabs and naan .. was decent .. service is quite decent too .. ambience is average .. .. you will find many in the area ..
4
Helpful staff and pretty decent food they served. Me and my friends love the atmosphere there though! Not a huge fan of curry but decent place overall
5
First time we went to an Indian restaurant ever. We were lucky to have such a great host who was explaining every dish! We tried several small dishes and shared the food. The food is good, I think a bit pricey, but it's worth the money.
4
Visited the place with family and relatives...the vegetarian starters were good...the main course was also good except for the Dal Makhani which seemed to have a different taste for some reason...ordered the kulfi for desert but it was frozen too much and all ice...replaced it with Ras Malai which was yummy!!
4
Cheap and cheerful. Good service and tasty food. Not a great ambience and very quiet for a Saturday afternoon on Orchard road... worth a visit if your craving Indian food. Had the chicken tikka masala and saag ghost, with garlic naan. Everything executed very well.
4
I stopped for early lunch. Staff was super friendly. Food was good: some curry,rice, paneer and nan. A very usual fare. The price is good but not cheap. And in spite of everything being good, it was not memorable. Just an option in the Orchard area
5
After a day of melting November heat, yes November heat, I needed beer-hydration. I saw The Curry Culture from a few feet away and tried to walk past it. We had just come from Little India and I knew off the bat that I would be paying 5 times the prices I would have seen in Little India. However AJ (or maybe Ajay) called out to us and asked us if we were interested in taking a look at the menu. The menu looked like a typical Indian restaurant one would expect to find in NYC or Toronto. One that caters to non-Curry eating palettes. But I needed a beer. We ended up trying out the Samarkhandi prawns and the Seekh Kebabs. Apparently, I have been doing it right my entire adult life. Usually at Indian/Pakistani restaurants, I usually first try the kebabs. They were phenomenal. Pricey but what to expect in a trendier neighbourhood. The food was spicy enough to enjoy and savour, even though personally I would prefer it to have a bit more heat. The service was excellent, makes the meal so much more memorable and enjoyable.

We went for dinner yesterday with our family of 5 members. We were greeted with smile, order was taken politely. The food was served very soon, tasted very good. The service was top notch too. All good, no complaints till we went to check out the wash room to wash hands. Wow it had been the terrible washroom we had visited. It was stinking and spilled with tissue papers all over. The washroom had tarnished the whole positive impact the food and service made. I informed the staff, then they allowed us to wash our hands in the bar area. Hope the management looks into it.
5
The food was incredible as was the service. Most of the menu could be made gluten free safely. The staff were very knowledgeable about Gluten Free and what was in their food. Great atmosphere. Our family of 4 ate for SD$130. No liquor.
5
Amazing curry experienceExcellent food. Nice place and perfect service The very professional personalThanks a lo

Great food...and we are Londoners so we know curry. Warm staff, great ambience, and service. It's great you can have half portions to let you try so many more dishes. Highly recommended. .don't miss it.
4
It's one of those places under Royal holding on cuppage street. Nice ambiance, good food and great service !
4
We had dinner at The Curry Culture and greatly enjoyed our meal. Attractive room (and outside dining) and friendly, helpful service which left us smiling. Very good butter chicken and lamb vindaloo. Recommended
4
As usual we trusted the good reviews on trip advisor and we were really pleased with our choice. Amazing butter chicken and friendly customer service. We will definitely come back!
5
Great curries and lovely attentive staff! We had the goan fish and the saag gosht and loved both! Also the cheese naan was amazing. We'll be back! :
3
I think this restaurant is rather over-hyped. I found the onion bhaji doughy (although maybe that is their recipe). The vindaloo sauce was good, but-the meat was grey & overcooked. The staff had troubles comprehending that ice water. Should be cold ( and contain ice).Overall, very average
4
Comparing this restaurant to the Indian restaurants we visit locally in Sydney the quality was good but not great. The curries were tasty but didn't really hit the mark for me and were below expectations after reading the reviews on here. Although The Chicken tikka was delicious. Great level of spice and succulent.The butter chicken was bland. The chicken didn't taste like it had marinated for very long so it lacked flavor.
5
Excellent food with excellent service. Comfortable decor with spacious seating. Jimmy suggested splitting mi main course into two smaller portions for thr price of a main. I had rogan josh and butter chicken. The lamb melted in my mouth.
5
Outstanding Indian food. As good as anywhere in India. Friendly and compitent service. The same owners also have a Thai Restaurant two doors away, but that is quite forgetable, no idea of Thai food. I can highly recomend Curry Culture though
5
Really close to orchard road this restaurant offers a menu with many possibilities even for vegetarians to taste Indian food. I really enjoyed chicken kathi rolls , chicken butter with saffron rice and Indian butter bread. Of course with a pint of tiger beer . I will go again to taste other specialities 
4
Quick service and really tasty food. Had the Bhuna and it was really nice. Good level of spice and flavour, could taste fresh ingredients. Beer is a little pricey but very glad we ventured here
5
good curry this place we love because I'm a curry lover
I am happy to serve
with good food i very like
I will return to this place.
5
Not tasted Indian food this good for a long time. Deserves the reviews it has. Service was great. Would definitely recommend. We ordered butter chicken, a vegetarian dish, naan bread and rice which was great for 2 adults and a child
5
We ate here on a previous visit to Singapore just shortly after this restaurant opened and wanted to revisit due to our very memorable experience. We weren't disappointed. We had a lovely meal with excellent service. Ate inside as we wanted a quieter meal rather than outside which had a bustling atmosphere with the other restaurants nearby. This restaurant serves good quality authentic Indian food. The vindaloo is highly recommended if you like spicy food. Very attentive service from charming staff. So pleased that we revisited. Will be back when next in Singapor
5
Food here is amazing! I am in Singapore for the first time on business and saw this place was highly rated and close to my hotel. It was so good I went back to back nights! Highly recommend.
5
I went here with my daughter while we were having a SE Asia tour. I lived in Singapore for 7 years and this little jewel wasn't around in those days. Lovely buzz inside. The cocktails were delicious. We enjoyed fabulous naan breads and a selection of veggie curries. Ingredients were fresh and fragrant. Service was attentive without being irritating. A lovely evening
5
It has been a long, long lapse since my last visit.Today was such a hot humid evening.I stepped straight into the air-con interior of your restaurant.I was sat promptly as I was blocking the entrance/exit. LOLI ordered the Mango Mara, the Machhi Dil (which is off menu "I was informed"), the Murgh Kurma with Saffron Rice.And because of the long walk here on a hot humid evening, I asked for ice water too.Complimentary Papadums served with 3 condiments.Followed by the Mango Mara .. which was GOOD 8/10 score .. and I still wanted the ice water I asked for.Another prolonged lapse. I finished the papadums and Mango Mara. Still NO ice water.Had to ask again.The Machhi Dil arrived.PERFECTION !!! WOW I WAS SPEECHLESS.A rectangular plate of SUCCULENT morsels of fish with strands of onions heaped in a mound to the right.There were SIX GENEROUS SIZED beautifully seasoned and lightly cooked pieces ALL TRUELY JUICY TO THE POINT OF PERFECTION. 10/10 scoreAnd thenThe Murgh Korma and Saffron RiceAnother PERFECT 10/10 score !!The Saffron Rice serving was a good size. There were no overcooked grains (I checked !) It was a tad lacking in fragrance 9/10.The Chicken Korma .. DAMN .. the SAUCE was 11/10 score. RICH, SAVOURY, PIN-POINT PERFECT THICKNESS.The chicken pieces were COOKED JUST RIGHT .. SUCCULENT !! 10/10 score.I had finished the Mango Mara too quickly, so I had a Kingfisher Beer to complete this part of my meal.COMPLETELY SATIATEDWell worth my visit tonightSo GLAD " I Came Back "I hope the cooking and flavours today can be LOCKED IN and REPLICATED.As cooking is an art, and each dish is cooked at a particular moment in time, we can but hope we are LUCKY each time we visit .. lolThank you. You made my day .. TODA

Just had a very good meal at The Curry Culture. The menu has some of the ‘typical’ dishes that would you expect from an Indian but they also have some other more unusual dishes which is nice to see. We had vegtable samosas to start and then the lamb bhoona ghost curry with garlic naan. The flavours were fantastic! The staff were also very attentive and helpful when trying to make menu selections. I would definitely recommend trying The Curry Culture for some delicious Indian food, you wont be disappointed :-)
4
Arrived here late the other night and was the only customer left but was made to feel welcome despite the somewhat rushed service. Good butter chicken and roti bread
4
The location is the winner for the nice and chill ambience. The food was delicious too, although it took too long to be served. Getting a suitable reservation for this place was also tough. Again, everything was great, just the food preparation took too long (30-45 mins or maybe more)
5
Good place to have authentic Indian food. The place is located just across the busy mini India and annex to Park hotel.
5
The waiter 'AJ' was so personable and relaxed. He helped us with our food choices and checked on us on multiple occasions. Food was great and atmosphere nice too.
5
The location of outlet is orchard road, near city center mall . Love the set up , it has indoor and outdoor seating. Want quite dinner, do i for indoor with the AC. Love the veg dishes Yellow dal is all time fav tried eggplant, also , too good . Had mix of roti and nan. the mustard chutney is too good . do not miss i
4
This is a brand new outlet that they have opened at Farrer Park and I happened to go there for lunch on the second day after the opening. They serve buffet for lunch which is priced around 22 + + and the food is pretty decent. It has a good spread of vegetarian and non vegetarian options and the taste is pretty decent. Given that it is a new outlet they are still in the initial days so there were some fundamental issues in the buffet whereby they had two types of rice being served with no dal or gravy dish to go with. There were no fried items like pupadam which is part of any Indian buffet. Also it would be good if the items in the buffet are replenished and rotis are served hot. Overall the place is good as the ambiance is nice, location is good and well connected and the staff is very friendly. The staff was very receptive to feedback and were keen to improve their standard which is always a positive sign
4
Wanted to eat Indian food so decided to try this place for lunch. Small but well kept tidy restarurant with friendly staff. Amazing vindaloo, they acually ask you the spice level 1-10 you want your food to be. Deep flavours of the lamb Jalfrezi, which was our other choice
4
just landed in Singapore and looking for a quick dinner before trying to have some rest: we've come to Cuppgae where I knew there is a wide selection and tried Curry Culture.I'm not an expert of Indian cuisine, but it was very very good... phenomale prawns !Friendly service, price in line with expectation
5
First time dining here, don't visit Singapore that often. Chose the restaurant based on its TripAdvisor rating and proximity to our hotel, and we were not disappointed! The tandoori platter was one of the best I have ever had, and I've had lots. The mains were almost as good. Good service, reasonable prices, great food. Coming back here again
5
Saw mixed reviews on Trio Advisor for this restaurant but decided to give it a try. As a tourist, I needed google maps to find it as it's in a long row of bars and restaurants but I'm so glad we persevered as the food was outstanding. Complimentary popadoms and dips came with our drinks and I ordered the butter chicken and my husband had the chicken tikka masala and we had one nan and one rice to share. The food was delicious and the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. We opted to eat inside but the tables outside were right in the heart of the buzz and it was very busy. We had no long wait, we ordered extra drinks and everything was served promptly. We even received a complimentary sample of Indian rice pudding - much to my husbands delight! I honestly couldn't fault the place, the staff or the food and we came away full, but not uncomfortably so. Would have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant. And the butter chicken is well worth a go!
5
OH MY..........I'm not sure how I can put into words how amazing the butter chicken is here. Just go and get it. And feel free to write me a thank you note after you do
5
Simply the beat meal we've had in Singapore thus far - tikka masala and korma are exquisite; don't leave the naan ou
2
I love Indian food and have eaten in various Indian restaurants at least 100 times in the US, in Paris, in Macau, and of course in amazing India.The Curry Culture is one of the most expensive Indian meals I have had (in comparison to restaurants in Paris and New York) yet I rank its quality below average. The garlic naan was great but the two curries fell significantly below my expectation. Korma tasted diluted and serving sizes were also rather small. Overall I was disappointed and will not return
2
We visited the Orchard Road Restaurant after reading some good reviews and were very very disappointed ... I actually thought I had come to the wrong restaurant!! I ordered Goan Chicken and asked if I could have fresh chillies with it to spice it up... the waiter said they only have dried spices so they just added extra powder ...And that's exactly what it tasted of!! The fish had been cooked nicely but the sauce spoilt it. My husband ordered chicken Vindaloo.. in our experience "vindaloo" dishes achieve their delicious heat from a combination of spices which impart their flavours through cooking.... not copious amounts of dried chilli powder and red food colouring! On the plus side unlike the other recent poor review I have just read , our bread was fresh and delicious. We have been very fortunate to have eaten some fabulous Indian meals in various parts of the world ... unfortunately this was not one of them.
4
Wanted to enjoy a good curry so went with this TripAdvisor recommendation and was not disappointed. Very good selection of high quality choices. We had Lamb Vindaloo ( you get to choose your spice strength out of 10 and I chose 3 which was pretty hot only to be told by the waiter that a visiting Australian pilot holds the record at 14 !) , chicken jalfrezzi and an excellent vegetarian dish comprising aubergine, coconut and peanut. We also had very good naan bread which was piping hot and perfectly cooked . Very friendly and helpful staff and well worth a visit .
2
After dinner tonight I was compelled to write this review as we were very disappointed with the food and hope the owners will take this review seriously. The quality and taste at the Orchard road outlet has deteriorated so much over the last year that I would not recommend it to anyone. We had ordered the Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Jalfrezi. Both dishes were brought and I was surprised to see that both dishes were identical Red in color. They had used so much food coloring and your fingers would turn red once you dipped your fingers in the gravy. The taste was no where close to where it used to be when we first visited this place 2 years back and subsequent 2 visits. We ordered the Aloo paratha and can tell you the aloo had already changed taste which means it was not fresh. We also ordered the Prawn tandoori with crab stuffing, it lacked salt and taste was not upto expectation. We have been to all of the best North Indian restaurants in Singapore and had high regards for Curry culture. But after this visit we will not be back again. I wanted to inform the waiter my feedback on the spot but didnt want to waste my time as we were shocked with the whole experience
5
A good way to experience the taste of India in Singapore.Cozy atmosphere and gentle personnel........ and amazing experience into the curry taste.All good. Well done!I will sure return next time in Singapore
5
The food is sensational, the setting is great and so is the service. Ordered the kashmiri naan which was fantastic and the chicken vindaloo. I asked for spice level 5 and it blew my head off. Just as I like it. The aroma of everyone's food around me will make me go back for more.
5
We were in Orchard road and searched for Indian food. We were surprised by quality of food. we didn't expect it to be this good. The staffs were friendly and helpful. highly recommended as there are not many good Indian food in Singapor
5
I was traveling in Singapore with my Mom and we had found this place while shopping in the near by area. The food and service was outstanding. It was really authentic. I hope to come back next time I am in the area
5
One thing that is very outstanding about this Indian restaurant is its Kashmiri Naan. I really like Indian food and have tried it in many places but I've never heard the socalled Kashmiri Naan. The waitress suggested us to combine it with our chicken butter curry. The result was... stupendous! The milky taste of the chicken curry was perfectly matched and counterbalanced by the fruity Kashmiri Naan. So you have this rich and milky taste in your mouth. In fact, the Kashmiri Naan tasted really good on its own.Apart from that, our food also tasted pretty well.. I tried its thick masala tea after dining and tasted really good. The staff was also really friendly and helpful!I would recommend this restaurant for Indian food lovers! Don't forget to try its Kashmiri Naan
5
I have too go here every time I visit Singapore. Its located right near Hotel Jen, and in the bustling Cuppage Terrace restaurant area, just off Orchard road. If you cant get a table outside (and you may struggle depending on time of day) then its likely they can find you one inside, although inside is limited seating. Last time there I ate here 2 nights in a row. The mixed dipping dips entree is great, and reasonably filling for one, particularly if you get extra pappadums to get thru it. The food is great, as is the service. Didn't have to wait long to be fed, even when very busy. Will definitely be returning next time I'm in Singapor

Having done some checking prior to arrival in Singapore, I had found The Curry Culture to get the top ratings for Indian food. So, first night in town we booked a table and headed that direction. Easy to find, just off of Orchard Road and within in easy walking distance from the Somerset metro station, we found a very nice are of restaurants that offered both indoor and outdoor dining, among them The Curry Culture. We opted for outside, which was a gamble during August in Singapore. However, high powered fans were placed well and created a pleasant climate. Reviewed the wine list and opted for a very nice Australian Riesling. Overpriced, but that is the norm in Singapore for wine and this pricing certainly was not outrageous by the city standards. The wine was served properly and placed in an ice bucket. Points for proper wine handling! We chose an appetizer of grilled paneer and then two main dishes, one Lamb Vindaloo and one Dal Makhani along with Saffron Rice and Garlic Naan. Dishes were served in reasonable time, allowing us to enjoy the wine, appetizer, and the evening without feeling rushed. When ordering the Vindaloo, I was asked if what level of spice, between 1 and 10. I opted for 5 as I like it Indian Hot. Word of advice, 5 is VERY hot. Certainly hotter than I would have expected. With that said, the dish was excellent and the quality of meat (always a concern with lamb) was superb. The Dal was also very good as were the accompaniments. Service was also at a very high level while not being intrusive. Overall experience was so good we opted to go back during the trip, which is not something I regularly do. Well done Curry Culture
5
While in Singapore on business, I used Trip Advisor to select an Indian restaurant. Curry Culture was excellent. Warmly greeted by Mr. Matthew, who made great recommendations per my request. I had the boneless fish curry, along with eggplant curry. The flavor was spectacular
5
I visited here with my kid and wife .the food was just amazing.moreover the service was super fast, and they used to.prepare food for my kid in very short time.must try butter chicken and bhindi.the staff is extremely hospitabl
5
Small restaurant in cuppage house but great good. Butter chicken here is too good. Roomali rotis were served fresh and service outstanding.
5
The nan were especially good and the butter chicken was also delicious!My family finished all the curry
5
The curry culture is just off Orchard Rd and small boutique restaurants neighbour it either side, Covent Garden-esque setting. The staff are very friendly and informative about the menu and the spices used in each dish. Very friendly. The curry culture is very particular about spices and flavour and when the waiter asked if I wanted "English medium or Indian medium?" I thought that I'd try the latter, go up the spice scale a bit. I was expecting it to burn my throat to ashes but instead it wasn't quite what I expected. Quite tame but nevertheless the flavour was terrific. I expected it to be a little hotter, no water needed.The basmati rice and keema naan were both very nice and went well with the main dish and the seekh kebab and onion bahji to start were very nice. Equally, the chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream for dessert was fabulous. I would definitely recommend if visiting Singapore.

Came for a meal on my wife's birthday. In a large party of 8. We didn't have starters and opted for only main course. As portions a good size this was a wise choice. I had chicken tikka and my wife had Lamb vindaloo. And you can order strength between 1-10 but be wary about ordering too spicy. We enjoyed what we had and service was excellent. Manager came to check everything was ok and no complaints from us. This is a tourist area and not cheap but we had a nice evening and would return no problem

Recently visited this place for lunch and were pleasantly surprised to find a set lunch option for SGD 17 nett. There were four of us office colleagues- two veg and two non-veg, and they basically give you a soup, choice of any two dishes from the menu, dal, rice and a naan or roti, ending with a small portion of sweet. The dishes come in small bowls, but since it's north indian food, it's heavy and the food was enough for all of us. Their Bhendi, palak paneer and baingan were pretty good, as also the Dal. Soup was the only disappointment- it did not seem fresh (was a bit sour)- but everything else was good. Service was excellent. We sat outside under a fan and it was a surprisingly pleasant experience. Will surely visit again

After some googling my wife and I settled on the curry culture for dinner on our last night in Singapore. I saw a free flow beer deal on Thursdays on their website (they forgot to remove it) however still honoured the deal when I told them that's one of the reasons we turned up (given how expensive alcohol is in Singapore).. great food, good beer and a nice buzzy atmosphere at a reasonable price. We enjoyed it so much that next time we stop in Singapore we will be back for sure!!
4
Had a mixed plate of tandoori meat and fish. It was very tasty! Also naan with cheese and chilli. If you like curries this is for sure a nice place to go!
5
We had dinner at Curry Culture in Cuppage Terrace. We had passed by the restaurant earlier in the day and liked the menu, so booked an outdoor table for later that night. We had an excellent meal, brilliant service and the food was lovely. We enjoyed the complimentary poppadoms and dips, as well as the delicious Goan fish curry and Kerala mutton, with rice, garlic naan and cheesey naan. While not the cheapest around, we had a great meal and a good night out at Curry Culture
4
So, we were trying to find something new in town and didn't plan to spend SGD 168 for 2-person late dinner. What we ordered;1. 2-glasses of white wine2. 2-glasses of beer3. Cheese & Butter Naan4. Lamb ganush5. Beef curryI think the end bill we received was a bit too over priced. Anyway -- we had yet a fantastic experience because;Pros :1. Service is wonderful -- the wait staff ensure everything was ok and enough.2. Foods are fresh and well tested.3. The ambience was wonderful although a bit too loud at the outdoor seated but if you prefer more exclusive, there is indoor seated.Cons :Expensive
5
This was within walking distance of our hotel. We loved the food, a lamb dish which was recommended by our waiter and a Fish Malabar Curry. Great taste, great flavour. The restaurant is in a food court with many other restaurants so the atmosphere is very buzzy. A great evening out.
4
I had a chicken curry, it was excellent! I also had two beers, naan, all for about 60 S$. I applaud the food and the service, but that struck me as a bit much. The setting is not fancy etc ( which suited me just fine), but then why this price level? Perhaps Singapure is simply very expensive: this was my first restaurant trip here
5
Located on a buzzing side street of Orchard Road. Excellent service, even better tasting curry and cheesy naan. Good value by Singapore standards
4
We visited this place last Dec (2016) , very nice indian food . Ordered Dal makhani and butter chicken with Naan
5
Lovely welcome from the host when we arrived. The gentleman brought a sample of the lime juice when I explained I am diabetic and wanted mine without sugar.He then helped us narrow down our choices and checked how spicy we liked our food.A complimentary taster dish was brought to us between starters and mains which was a nice touch. Butter chicken was exactly as we hoped, one of the best we have eaten. We also had Malabar fish curry which was top notch too. Garlic naan complimented this perfect meal. Price wise, we thought the bill was very fair for the quality of food we had eaten
5
A balmy Sunday night was a great setting for variety of Indian food at its best. Started with Papdi Chaat, what a delight and instructed the correct way to be eaten added to the resultant flavourMains of tandoori mixture that included fish, prawn, chicken,lamb was superb. Just to add to mains, Keema Mattar which was lamb mince like you never have had before and a mushroom curry that I have forgotten it's name highlighted how good this place is. A serve of rice and naan complimented the foodSweets were of top orderIf in Singa , this is a must if you want real IndianPS. The service was first rate and persona
4
After a day full of shopping we ended at the Curry Culture, a definitely don't regret that. Great atmosphere and delicious Indian food served in gentle way
5
Very good Indian food. Great atmosphere: covered street so good for all weather conditions. It's a lively corner just off of Orchard Road.
5
Went there for lunch and had the 17$ nett set
Soup, 2 curries, dals, naan, rice, dessert
Food was amazing and the service top notch
Highly recommended
4
Went to the Curry Culture for an evening meal, and was really impressed. Good food (although a little expensive) and great service. The one issue I found was that the food was very, very spicy, so be sure to order really mild food. Nice location and ambience, and overall really enjoyed it :
5
The intense flavours of the north Indian curries here were fabulous. It reminded me of the best curries you used to get in the UK and now are sadly so rare. So if you are a true curry lover - come here 
4
Very nice Indian food in the middle of a strip of bars/restaurants just off Orchard Road. Their was music from a neighbouring bar - whether you. Liked it or not - but the food was delicious and the staff gave great recommendations especially to cater for my gluten free needs. Really nice paneer and aubergine dishes. Check out the advice in the beer section of the menu
5
I often travel to Singapore for Business purpose, and stay at orchard (the most happening place in Singapore), but difficult to find good vegetarian Indian food. This place id about 15 mins walking from orchard MRT and very near to Somerset MRT. The food served here is really a treat to the people striving for good Indian food. The flavour is just perfect and the staffs are very friendly. In short excellent food and service
5
We went here yesterday based on reviews from TripAdvisor and was not disappointed. We had the set lunch menu and were so full when we left we waddled out. All four curries and dal were amazing. The naan was fantastic. Could barely fit in the dessert. Great service. Thank you!
5
Outstanding Indian food. Outstanding special treatment from the host, Mr. Matthew. One of the most amazing dining experiences in recent times. Planning to go back in a couple evenings to explore more of the menu before leaving Singapore
5
Was in Singapore recently with family and parents for a week's holiday. My wife is vegan and my mother is gluten intolerant which presents a dining challenge on two fronts.The service and the food was the best we had experienced in the week we were there. The staff really understand that dining out is an experience not just a transaction and were very good at putting my mother's mind at rest regarding gluten free options
4
I loved the flavour. Food was spicy and yummy. Had chicken vindaloo and tikka masala (medium spicy). Was very flavourful. Local is great too - next to Orchard Road. Best for North Indian food.
4
This restaurant on village road is good and serves decent Indian food. The service is good and prices are reasonable though the portions are very less. Definitely worth a visit if u are traveling in this part
5
We had quite a large group and this venue was perfect. The service was very good and there was a great range of dishes - some were tailored to the individual's requirements which was very helpful. Nice atmosphere and well worth a visit.
4
不錯吃 但上菜很久 應該是因為他們不小心忘記我們的點單。 味道不錯， 地方也滿好找的。not the best Indian food but it's good. Not amazing~~~ I would come again. AC is not strong enough kind of hot inside
2
The food at this restaurant was not very authentic and overpriced. The sheekh kebabs tasted of flour instead of a meaty flavour. The gravy in the lamb curry that I ordered also tasted like it was made from a ready-made boxed curry powder rather than the traditional spices that you normally taste in a curry
5
We had fish curry with coconut milk and chicken tikka masala and they were great. They can make spiciness levels, from 1 to 10. Ours were 1 and 2 . For our european taste, 2 was just perfect. Tap water and delicious pandicha bites (I hope this is the correct name) on the house. Good, refreshing nonalcoholic drinks with ginger and lime. They have a nice terrace and great service, recommend.
5
Very friendly service and delicious food.It is child friendly and the meal we chose for our little one, was really good.We enjoyed their lunch set, that had just the right portions and we will be back
5
Absolutely wonderful! We were craving Indian food and this one hit the spot! The service is outstanding, great suggestions and guidance. I was most impressed by the children meal options, they have thought it through very well
5
Just bumped into this place after unsuccessfully trying to buy a men's hat in Orchard Road. In a group of preserved shop-houses with outdoor dining under a massive roof.The smell from the kitchen was riveting and the food that followed was just about perfect.Nothing special or showy -just well made curries with a delicious depth of flavor. Wine's expensive but find a place in this town where it isn't. It's comfortable -you'll like it.Ask the owner Prashant Kumar if he remembers the siege of Mafeking
5
We visited during our honeymoon, and they treated us very nicely, we even got a dessert on the house! The food was very good, and they were very attentive to my allergies and made sure everything was perfect, thank you to the manager who attended us so kindly
5
We are very pleased with the food and the service. Location is at central, near Orchard Road @ Cuppage along with other restaurants and bars. The staff is very friendly and give great suggestions from the menu.
5
We dined at The Curry Culture after reading the reviews. The food was very tasty and the service was fantastic, definitely recommend
4
I visited this restaurant based on the good reviews on TripAdvisor and had a good meal here. The wait staff was attentive and I enjoyed what I ordered. The complimentary mango lassa was a nice touch too. The BUT factor comes in when I opted to use the restrooms before I left the restaurant. As another reviewer noted they were absolutely FILTHY! In fact it was disgusting and made me wonder if the bathrooms were this bad, how must the kitchen look? Also, it appeared as if they were re-using the various sauces one is given as part of the appetizer as when I exited the bathroom I saw what appeared to be a waiter pouring the unused portions of these sauces into new serving dishes. I hope I am wrong about the latter as that would be very un-hygenic but it did make me wonder about the overall cleanliness of this establishment and I am not sue that I would go back again even though I do love Indian food
5
I always have the Lamb with spinach gravy and have it extra spicy, with a plate of their heavenly basmati rice. This restaurant has been the number 1 whenever i think about Indian food. And to add a cherry on the cake, a nice cold beer on tap to pair with the spicy food. Brilliant
5
**Apologies for late review!**As the title says,my partner and i had decided to try The Curry Culture as rhey came highly recommended on both TripAdvisor & Google. This was my first time (always had a thing about spicey foods).The gentleman at the door to the restaurant could not have been more kind and helpful-over and above trying to get bums on seats..he went the extra mile to make sure we were happy.The food was amazing,with different tastes recommended to us with their expert knowledge.We had the Butter Chicken and Chicken Jalfrezi..sooo tasty!We both loved the meal & the gorgeous desert (kesari...a milky rice pudding:P)The service throughout was first class,attentive and way beyond what i expected.We were even given extra dishes free just to see flavour differences!The prices were very reasonable considering the comfortable surroundings and amazing service and quality of food.Long story short..if a fussy eater like me can enjoy a delicious meal there...you can too,do NOT miss out!10/10!
5
Great service from the moment you arrive. Really appreciated the staff making sure they understood what I wanted to order. The food was just like in India. Prices are similar to other restaurants in the area. Easiest way to get there is by taxi, however, MRT Somerset NS23 is not far either Strongly recommend
3
I booked this place for a special occasion due to the great reviews and high rating on here. I really did have high expectations of this place. I was not bowled over by my first impressions. The decor and ambiance was pretty standard. However, I didn't let this put me off as i was looking forward to tasting the food.What did put me off were the toilets! I went in to wash my hands only to walk straight back out! They were worse than public toilets. I also agree with previous comments about the air con. It was barley on.We ordered a mix grill for starter. It was ok. For mains I was really excited to see methi chicken ( my favourite curry) on the specials menu however I was left disappointed. It was really salty and tasteless.The service was good and the staff were friendly but overall I left the place feeling disappointed that it didn't live up to the hype and I just didn't enjoy my food. Meal came to around £90 for two which I though was on slightly on the expensive side but that is probably normal for Singapore
5
We're from England, the capital of curry, so this restaurant had its work cut out, but it did not disappoint. Bhajis were perfect, not too doughy and with a nice crisp exterior. Samosas were certainly well-filled and tasted great. The mushroom dish and rogan josh for mains came with flavourful sauces / spices and just the right amount of heat. The proprietor looked after us and the menu is as he said 'not overly complicated'. What this restaurant does it does well. The only downside was the price, around £74 for two persons for a meal with drinks that would probably have cost less than £40 in the U.K., but then, this is Singapore.
3
OK: The interior AC was barely working which didn't help the experience (it was cooler outside). Service was nice. No dish particularly remarkable, average at best from what we had. The area is a cluster of over priced restaurants in a patio setting and convenient to Orchard Road. Tip: restaurants in Singapore tend to be over priced for what they are
5
Thought we'd try this place as it was nearby and had great reviews - it certainly did not disappoint! The staff were very attentive and friendly (but not overly). The waiter was kind and helpful - he made some great suggestions when I mentioned I was vegan. (Hyderabadi Baingan curry - eggplant, peanut and coconut milk with moderate spice, plus the saffron rice & garlic naan.. so delicious!!) He mentioned the peshwari naan has cheese on top but they would happily prepare one without for me we tried this too - it was a little on the sweet side but still delicious! My b/f ordered the chicken tikka masala and informed me that it was also scrumptious :)Would HIGHLY recommend this place - the last time I had a curry this good I was in Chennai!! Really great food and fantastic service!
3
at first Im not fond of eating curry but when we tried 5 curries . It was soo good and close to perfection . Now I can say curries are one of the best . Thanks Curry Culture :
5
So much choice in singapore. But this is a great choice ! Chicken tikka and garlic nan. To die for. Service excellent.
5
So happy with everything there. Great taste and quality. 5 people went and all 5 enjoyed the food. We tried 10 Curries and each 1 of it was close to perfect
5
My wife and I went to The Curry Culture based on the high ranking on Trip Advisor. I ordered the lamb cutlets, which were cooked perfectly but seemed to lack flavour after I tried my wife's chicken Jalfrezi. One of the best curries I've ever tried. Would recommend based on food and service, but the toilets need to be cleaner!
5
Really enjoyed our meal here. So tasty and food was reasonably priced (drinks were on the steep side). The only downside were the toilets. Would visit again
5
So I'm slightly biased but also placed to do an objective review as I live round the corner !It's on a local strip but worth tracking down if your a tourist and does a blended north / South Indian cuisine well !!Reasonably priced and great for a take away if your a local Five stars every day of the week !! Keep up the good work :
4
The food here is delicious . Not too spicy for the faint hearted curry lover but they have plenty of hot dishes on the menu.The staff were very friendly and courteous and the food arrived in a very timely manner.Price was not cheap but not over the top either. Basically what is expected in Singapore .Would recommend this place
3
Visited on 20th may 2017.personally speaking its average restaurant rather can say it is much better to visit tandoor restaurant if interested to spend same amount
5
We chose The Curry Culture for our last meal before flying out of Singapore. It turned out to be an excellent choice and a memorable experience. The menu is extensive, the food is authentic and delicious, the prices are reasonable and the service is friendly and attentive without being pushy. The restaurant is located in the Cuppage Rd eatery precinct which is lined with historic shop houses which give it a great atmosphere
5
Great food great ambience and attentive staffs. Food was worth the wait!the service was fantastic. The butter chicken and the nann were awesome
4
I recently walked in to Curry Culture following my fellow Trip Advisors recommendation.I went on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was busy so do book if they allow.They will start you off with some cracker bread and dip to keep you entertained. I had a chicken curry (can't remember the exact name) with rice and garlic nan. The dish had one chilli sign and it was already borderline for my taste but still good. The food was well cooked and tasty. Portion was enough.This and 2 beers costed me more than 65 sing but well... Singapore is not a cheap place.Staff were very friendly and efficient.Definitely a place to consider if you're in the neighbourhood.Safe travel
4
Had a nice meal here as a couple this week. W didn't fancy a starter and just went straight for the main courses. I opted for Bhuna Gosht which was delicious with large chunks of lamb through it. My wife went for Butter Chicken and whilst it was very tasty, the chicken was so tender that it had already broken apart in the sauce so it was quite a challenge to pick through he sauce for the pieces of chicken. It was more like shredded chicken. Service was great with main course served in well under ten minutes. Will definitely return when next in area.
5
this is only place I have my favourite indian food yummy taste of paprika chat, naan, kebab...wow... I love it,,no other cuisine I found like the taste of indian cusine...place is net and clean,friendly stuff...
3
Lovely Indian food, really tasty and great service. This place is only let down by the toilets which are in a terrible state, ended going to the nearby bar instead!Such a shame but the state of the loos makes you think about the general hygiene.
5
Traveling alone in Singapore, I decided I wanted to eat good Indian food. I love Indian food and eat this cuisine whenever I have the chance when traveling. The food at The Curry Culture was outstanding as was the service. The wait staff made every effort to ensure I ordered well, selected the right level of spiciness and was happy with each dish served. My meal was outstanding. And then to my delight, my waiter surprised me with the best mango lassi ever!! I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with their meal at The Curry Culture.
5
I'd definitely return to this one. Delicious food, nice atmosphere, warm service. Seems to be equally popular with locals, expats and tourists. Outdoor dining but at this time of year was very pleasant
5
This is my best ever dinner experience. Their Service to customers are awesome which helps to a fine dinning. Mr.Jimmy and Mr.Prashanth, these guys are doing a great job and also other staffs who welcomes us and serves drinks with a smile. A must visit restaurant in Singapore
5
And that's saying a lot! I've been lucky to have some incredible Indian meals( my favorite!) on my travels around the world and this is place sets the bar pretty high! First of all, it's a bit pricey, one of our most expensive meals in Singapore. Not over the top, but pricey, but unless you are eating at a local place, the food tends to be spending while eating in this beautiful city. But... it's so worth it. We sat inside, this place was hoppin! And all the seats were taken outside, but inside was charming and the service was top notch! We split a few dishes and loved them all! This is a great choice for Indian, believe me it's worth it! Their dishes have to most incredible combination of spices I've ever tasted! It will be hard to top this place! .
5
This is a fun place ... lots of restaurants in cuppage terrace and even on a sunday night most of them were busy. We hadnt booked but the staff were friendly and found us a spot outside The food is amazing - extensive menu and something to suit everyones tastes. really yummy
5
On our final evening in Singapore, the hotel concierge suggested we dine at Curry Culture. He phoned through for reservation, but through some miscommunication, we discovered it was closed! It was Robertson Quay that was under renovation.The hotel then contacted them and as an apology, Curry Culture invited us for lunch the following day at Cuppage Terrace with their compliments.I can honestly say the food was superb - Chicken Tikka, Butter Chicken, wonderful vegetable dishes all beautifully spiced .My wife and I have travelled on business and pleasure in SE Asia and we felt this close to the best Indian Food we have tasted.Our thanks to Jimmy Mathew and his staff
5
We enjoyed a fantastic meal here in 2013 so it was a no-brainer to rebook for a recent trip to Singapore.We were seated outside & enjoyed another extremely enjoyable evening. The menu and the food were excellent, as was the service.If you like Indian food and are in Singapore, this restaurant is a must
5
This place was rated very highly on trip advisor and it excelled! Very friendly service, delicious food, fantastic ambience. Vegetarian choices were excellent as well - top tip: try the paneer kathi roll. Thank you Sandeep!
4
I recommend this restaurant to everyone and would like to visit again. A good selection also for vegetarians.
5
I was visiting Singapore on a conference trip and had craving for some Indian food. After reading lots of great reviews about this place, we decided to dine here on a Friday night. Getting reservation was easy as we were here an hour before it's closing time. We were seated promptly outside and the server was quick enough to take our orders. We had samosa and papdi chaat as our appetizers. The papdi chaat was better of the two.. very tasty with right amount of tanginess, spices and chilly! The samosa was also good but I enjoyed the chaat more. I often judge an Indian restaurant by the kind of chaats they make. I was in the mood of having some cocktail which will be spicy yet having the good liquor .. the waiter knew perfectly my want and served me the India summer- cocktail with whiskey and spices.. it was the perfect drink I needed on a Friday night. A must try drink if you enjoy some spices! The main course- aloo paratha, Channa masala, tandoori roti and aloo gobi was spot on.. very tasty, flavorful and true to its kind. Definitely fabulous dining experience. The service was excellent and a perfect ambience to have dinner with friends. Next time will love to try non- veg dishes as they seem to be excellent! Thanks to TA for perfect recommendation.
5
After reading all the reviews, we had high expectations of this place. We're very big on Indian food so our bar is kind of high.The Curry Culture passed with flying colors. The food was downright delicious. We almost licked the last bits of sauce off our plates. We had the butter chicken, a lamb curry and some bread to go with all of it. It's making my mouth water just writing this review. Would lost definitely go back
4
Very good meal here; all dishes were tasty. We had the lamb mettar dish and the vindaloo. The roti starter was lovely too. Good selection of food and drinks. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the high prices, however, this is commonplace in most Singapore restaurants so we would definitely eat here again.
5
We chose this restaurant after reading multiple positive reviews on Tripadvisor. We ordered 1. Tomato Dhania Shorba 2. Chicken Vindaloo 3. Palak Paneer 4. Hara pyaaz Aloo Jeera 5. Garlic Naan 6. Pudina Parata 7. Laccha Parata 8. Malai Kulfi 9. Rasmalai. I have to mention 2 things. Every single dish was tasty and of decent portion size. The service of the manager and waiters is really worth mentioning. The manager provided good recommendations on the items ordered regarding spice levels. Definitely a great place to eat Indian food
4
 We visited on a Saturday afternoon around 12 and the place was surprisingly empty. However, the food didn't disappoint. We ordered 3 types of curry, and I would recommend butter chicken and the vindaloo curry. The waiter was nice and recommended spice level 1 for the curry so it wasn't too spicy. The naan and prata are musts to go with the curry and the waiter definitely made great recommendations depending on what we wanted to have. I would definitely visit again
5
Love the curries here and service from Jimmy always top notch. I always have 2 types of curry with garlic naan. The creamy lamb korma is the best I have had in Singapore. Then I opt for a spicy curry with gravy. Have had both chicken vindaloo and chicken tikka masala which are both solid
5
Have had many curries of various styles over many years, the one I ordered here was the best ever. Unusual facilities to eat but neat and clean, though humid the day I was there.The service was excellent and the waiter friendly and attentive.The food seemed a little expensive, maybe OK for Singapore, but worth every dollar
5
My wife came here a couple of weeks ago and raved about the Malabar fish curry. She had wanted me to try this whole week we have been here. Finally we made it for our last meal and it was amazing.Located just off Orchard road near the Somerset MRT. Next time we are in Singapore it will be our first stop not our last. The staff were extremely attentive and the food was so good. If you like Indian curry I would recommend this place to all.
5
Great to return to this little gem. The servers are SO good and nothing was too much trouble. They even remembered my partner from last year.The butter chicken was hiked up just right the garlic naan one of the best I've had for a while and he even cooked me some french fries(I know I'm a heathen!) Thee whole meal was very reasonable. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone
4
Plenty of good authentic Indian food at a reasonable price. Plenty of seats even during lunch time. No ambience as it's set up like a canteen
5
I did a good choice. The food is very tasty and the service very kind and fast. I have ordered the Lamb Vindaloo and I was very satisfied. I have ordered "spicy level 4", too much for me. The owner (I think he was) was there looking at the customers and he realized it was to strong. Without asking, he has proposed me to bring a new dish... "level 2". I told myself that a restaurant where the staff really take care of you, isn't so usual. Congratulations. I will come back, for sure
5
Situated at Orchard Street this was a blessing to our hungry belly while shopping. Expensive if you are comparing with India or even some shops @ Little India, but worth it. We paid 110 bucks for a lavish meal with non-alcoholic drinks
3
We had the prawn stuffed with crabmeat. It sounds better than it tastes and was probably overcooked. The chicken vindaloo could have been hotter, but that's because the very friendly waiter advised us to order only a 2 out of 10 on the spiciness scale. He had good intentions, I guess. We were there for lunch on a Monday, so the entire Cuppage Terrace was practically empty
5
The 3 starter sauces with the papadams are awesome. However the papadams themselves were a bit hit and miss, some were cracking, some were softer. Furthermore we had great garlic naan, chicken tikka was pretty good, the bhindi (ladyfingers, okra) were excellent. The dhal was a bit too thin for myself. Service was good and friendly. Would definitely come back
5
I just ate the best lamb vindaloo curry that I've ever eaten. The service is exceptional, the food is superb and the atmosphere is very pleasant. My second time here and the consistency is obvious. If you like curry and are in Singapore The Curry Culture is a must do
1
We ordered food through Deliveroo. The order came on time but when we opened the food, the food was inedible as it had hair in it. Not one by mistake but few. I complained thru Deliveroo but there was no response. I hope the restaurant improves its food quality.
2
Sorry to say that we weren't impressed with this place, due to the cost of the meals and the small nature of the dishes. We had chicken curry and lamb biriyani with a couple of drinks plus a child's meal and it came to around 145 Singapore dollars. Really not good value especially given the size of the portions which were very small. On the plus side, location was lovely, just off orchard road and in buzzy area, food was tasty.
4
Lovely location in Cuppage Place. Outdoor seating was very relaxing. Good food, nice menu and good service.I had Bhuna Ghost which was delicious. Wine was good too. Was not at all rushed and will definitely be back again
5
A very nice Indian restaurant with wonderful Foods and good staff. This area is congested with different restaurants with variety of cuisines. Guests sit out side the restaurant in a very beautiful designed area.
5
Great food, great service, great atmosphere. What else can I say?I tried 2 dishes that weren't my usual thing, breaded mushrooms to start (fiery), and Hyderabadi Eggplant and Peanut Curry. Both were fantastic
3
The food is good but prices are just too expensive. we payed 180sgd for dinner for 3. we ordered 3 nans, 1 rice, one butter chicken, one tandoori plater, one day and 3 beer
5
Booked table for two for a Saturday night. Chose inside to use the air conditioning. Very efficient service. Ordered Chicken Tikka Marsala and Samarkandi Prawns with garlic naan and rice. Both mains were excellent. Good size portions and distinctive tastes. The restaurant is licensed and wine prices reflect the usual heavy slug you find in Singapore although wine by the glass is available.Highly recommended
5
We have visited several times and will continue to do so. Food is always good quality and very tasty. Staff are friendly and attentive. Great to share dishes and if you ask for dishes to be brought together, they will be (this is not the case in many Singapore restaurants) Location is great, just off orchard road, but still has some atmosphere. Recommend to book
4
If you like curries, then you will love The Curry Culture. The food is really good but the service and staff are even better. Wonderful atmosphere, fun, these guys love what they do. The owner floats around, happy to chat as long as you like, the staff are all in the right mood and the whole experience was really enjoyabl
4
We started with poppadoms and some spicy fish nibbles which were delicious.The chicken Tikka and Jalfrezi were also good however this place is memorable because of the friendly staff. The waiters here are just super friendly, even though it was a busy night they took time to bring over a comped mango lassi when we ODed on the Chilli!Recommended
5
Happy that I visited the resturant as it was quite close to my hotel. Great Food and superb service. Would like to again visit on my next visit to Singapore
5
An Excellent service and a good Quality of food is served here. Have also been to Mumbay and I can say the food and taste brought me directly back to Mumbay atmosphere. Luckily I end of March again have the oppertunity to enjoy once again the beautiful and tasty Indian cuisine in Mumbay. The waiter even suggested and jotted down some recommendable places to eat when I vissit Mumbay,(photo attached), I will defintely give them a try. Thanks for the suggestion and see you back in June
4
Was missing the all time fav butter chicken so headed to this place and was blown away highly recommended this on
3
This place sells authentic Indian curry at a reasonable price.
Recommend that you come here for lunch and enjoy the curry.

We were in Singapore for a ten day business trip from Houston and my fellow travelers suggested we try The Curry Culture for a late lunch since it was top rated on TripAdvisor. I was reluctant to try it because I have not liked Indian food in the past. But wow...I'm so glad we went. The food was very tasty (they did all the ordering and I just shared) and my eyes have now been opened to a new cuisine. Indian food will definitely be on my list of restaurants in the future. In summary, the food was excellent as was the service. Very cozy small restaurant - but definitely worth the trip on the MRT to test the Trip Advisor recommendation. To try a variety, we split our orders between 4 people and ended up with lots of leftovers. Everything was absolutely delicious. Our orders included Dahi Baingan, Mix Vege Pakodas, Murphy Tikka Masala, Naan Butter, Purdah Biryani Chicken, Saffron Rice, Naan Garlic, 4 Mango Lassi's, and 1 Diet Coke for a total of $158 Singapore

This is our second time visiting the place, and it never fails us so far. Often time, when we eat in a place which makes great food, they get too bussy so the service compromize the food. It does not happen here. They provide great service, good advice on whcih to choose from the menu, and the quality of food never fails us. We tried the briani rice this time, it was one of the best we had, fragrant and taste really nice. If you like milk / cream, try their butter chicken. For a tangy curry with a fresh herb touch, we tried prawn malabar. Hmhmhmh, happy tummy.
5
We were only in Singapore for a couple of nights and we decided to eat here based on reviews. The curries were delicious - paleek panner and tikka masala. We also ordered garlic naan and rice. We spent 3 weeks over Christmas traveling around India and we thought the curries were just as good at Curry Culture. Service was also excellent.
5
I arrived late, and the team at Curry Culture were still very accomodating.The curry was excellent, the papadum's great to start with. Having lived in Mumbai I really appreicate a great curry! The team was all over me wanting me to try the new dishes - and give their recommendations.Service - could not be faulted. Well done - i will be back next visit.
5
Good food, good menu and good location. 2nd time I have been and enjoyed both times. Staff are very friendly and helpfu
5
Found this superb curry house a few minutes walk from our hotel. We hadn't booked but the staff were very friendly and helpful and quickly sorted out a table outside for us.Great advice from the staff on which dishes to choose.Everybody chose differently and all agreed the food was excellent. Next time in Singapore definitely a return visit. Great location to visit other bars as well.
5
If you are looking for a great Curry in Singapore check out The Curry Culture I had a great meal there. Staff are very friendly and will help you choose and explain all there dishes on there menu. It's a must!!!!
5
Love authentic curry dishes and was not disappointed in curry culture. From the moment we arrived we received outstanding, personal and friendly service, the atmosphere was pleasant and the service was very good. Along with our choices from the menu we were given some very tasty examples to try of alternatives. Was the best meal and service we received in a week at Singapore. Hoping to return soon!!
5
We had a reservation, but by any cause it eas lost even it was confirmed. But we got a table inside (which we preferred according to the climate). We had some soups as starters (mulligatawny soup) and as main courses chicken tikka masala and 2 other types of curries. All was excellent and perfect prepared. Easy going service, that gave us advice which dish to prefer, even regarding spicyness. And also many restaurant guests coming from the Indian area
4
Great location with outdoor and indoor option. Good north indian food with lot of variety albit bit spicy..
4
Have been a few times for work and the service and food is always good. A noisy place, as they all are in this area so a little difficult to have deep chats when the crowds are there
5
good quality indian food nearby orchard road, friendly service and reasonable prices, veggie-friendl
4
Great lunch or dinner spot. My curry was hot (heat hot) thru and clearly hadn't just been 'heated up'.The Yellow Dahl dish was delicious and the Naan properly cooked.Service was very attentive and friendly.I'll be back
5
It was that hour of the day when you are too late for lunch and too early for dinner. This place was a saving grace for us hungry tummies. They served us out of the way and helped us with some quick snacks and tea. We loved the hospitality and authentic Indian taste
5
Extensive menu, friendly service and lively atmosphere (lots of restaurants on Cuppage) make this a fun place to try any night of the week. We had 10 people so were able to order many different dishes and share which is truly the way to go to sample many items
5
This great little Indian restaurant is located close to a lot of other restaurants in a relaxed food market kind of atmosphere. I recommend the daily specials and the garlic naan, it's authentic and delicious!
4
This restaurant is one of the very few options available near Orchard Road for indian food. It has both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements. We had dinner 3 times in a week here. Everytime they maintained the quality and didn't disappoint us. Although have very few options in menu but whatever they serve, serve with a smile and taste. We tried chicken biryani, methi malai mutter, Dal tadka. So overall good place for indian food
4
This is a great restaurant, the food is really tasty with plenty of vegetarian options. If you can get a table outside the atmosphere is brilliant. It's slightly expensive for what it is.Would definitely visit again. 8/1
5
Got here at 6:30 PM on a Saturday night. Great atmosphere, friendly staff. Friend spilled some sauce on his shirt, the staff immediately got him some soda water and lemon to clean it up. Paatdai Chaat was great. I had butter chicken (with spice added), friend had chicken masala, both were great. We both had plain rice and butter naan. Everything was amazing!!
4
We like Indian food generally and this place has good food. A bit on the pricier side but the food is fresh, well cooked and savory. And the service is also nice and friendly. We'll definitely come back.
4
Not bad at all, good selection of authentic Indian dishes, nice staff and good service, in traditional style we had many dishes to share. The only drawback is it's a little steep on the pocket for an Indian.
4
We went to this Indian Restaurant three times during our stay in Singapore.We found the staff were welcoming and service was pretty good.We were served complimentary poppadums and dips whilst waiting for a meal which arrived quite quickly.The food was well prepared and had very good flavours.Price was reasonable and certainly comparable with any of the other restaurants in the area.Well worth a visit if you enjoy authentic Indian cooking
4
After 16 days in Vietnam on a food extravagance we thought an Indian would finish it off & we weren't dissappointed. The food & service was grea
4
Very positive experience. Good quality on ingredients. Lamb so tender ! Arrived on a busy night - still ok service. Central location to Orchard Road. I will be bac
5
I have been here approximately 7 times. Upon every visit, I was greeted with outstanding hospitality. The food is simply amazing. I will always come back.
5
Great Indian food conveniently located in Cuppage. Can get very busy, but is open at 6 PM. Good for early eaters like me. Many recognizable staff over the years I've been eating here. Do not expect a budget meal, but the money is well spent for the quality and service
5
Food is the best ! Never have I tried such good indian food. I have been here almost every day I have been in Singapore. Must go!!!
5
We had a wonderful diner with my girlfriend , food are well served and delicious ! And you have many shoppings open till late next to this place . And the waiters were particularly careful always asking if everything it's ok! I have no worries to recommend this place! Staff A+Food A+Prices A+Location 
4
Coming originally from the UK, I find it difficult to find Indian restaurants to quite match what I gave grown up with.This is as good as I have found anywhere and not just is the food good, but they were happy to prepare and serve items not on the menu. So food and atmosphere-wise, I have no hesitation in recommending Curry Culture by Cuppage Terrace.What/who really impressed me was the Maitre'D. Not only was he accommodating and ensuring good service from his team, but when we visited 3 or 4 weeks after our first visit he remembered our previous food preferences. A great memory or system
4
Staff is friendly and professionnal, food is tasty, good seasoning, and good cooking of the chicken.
5
We had a very nice Indian meal, served quite fast, by good staff. Not cheap, but then nothing is in Singapore. The restaurant is in an interesting area well worth a vist anyway.
5
I found this place quite by mistake, and very pleased I did too, the staff are great and and made some good recommendation on the menu. the food is very tasty and well balanced, some time Indian food can just taste of curry!The food here was fresh and spicy you could taste each ingredient, beautiful !every time I am in Singapore I visit this place.(do not get confused with next curry house along with the fancy dressed Indian fella's
5
Great location near OrchardGood food esp. Kadai Paneer is very good. I like the service here which is very personalizedNot a good place for cocktails and drink
5
I found this restaurant using this site, which is fantastic, since it was delicious, easy to find, with great service and comfortable atmosphere. The inside part of the restaurant is small, found as it is in a food square, and they also have outside seating which we enjoyed. They serve cold water to all diners, as well as Papadum and three house-made sauces. We ate all vegetarian dishes, and the Palak Paneer was outstanding--smoky and flavourful with delicate cheese. They also have a great happy hour, which I enjoyed before going to see some live music. The maitre'd was especially friendly and helpful, but all the waiters were attentive and made us feel welcome
4
The food was great, the staff was friendly, we loved the dal tardka and mix vegetables. The service was good
5
Dining inside on a hot night choosing an eggplant and lamb saag curry best ever with Kingfisher beer. Add in a little buttered nan and you will enjoy some of the best Indian food reasonably priced. Enjoyable conversation with the owner and his philosophy on food and life
3
My wife found the highly rated curry culture based on tripadvisor near our hotel. With kids, this was important.To keep a long story short, service was friendly and nice, the starter I had was good, the curry my wife had was ok, my main was a bit disappointing. But the bad part was that I first got the wrong dish and that dish was included in our bill. This was rectified and we were given a discount, but still. Compared to the high marks on tripadvisor, our visit was a disappointment
5
Really friendly atmosphere and staff and all the usual favourite dishes. The onion bhaji's were nice and crispy, the chicken tikka masala really good and all reasonably priced! We will be back
5
When in Singapore this restaurant is a must. We visited twice while there, as once was not enough, the good is that great!!! Is the best Indian I have ever had and the service is fantastic. Very friendly staff who make you feel very welcome. Would recommend to all that visit Singapore
5
In the last night of my travel,
I had a nice ticken curry here.
Light was not so brightened at the terrace seat, relaxing mood was nice.
Fan wind was cooling softly.
Staff was with natural smile.
Good restaurant.
5
This is authentic Indian cuisine at its best. It's certainly not fine dining, but located just off Orchard Road, the terrace contains a number of bars and restaurants, of which The Curry Culture is one. The food is outstanding served beautifully by excellent staff. It's a great experience if you are in Singapore and somewhere I'd recommend Indian food lovers try. Simply delicious
5
I chose this place after reading so many positive reviews on TripAdvisor, and even though I had high expectations going in they surpassed it. The service was extremely friendly, all the staff had smiles on their faces and were extremely polite which makes a wonderful impact on the atmosphere of the place. The food itself was the best Indian food I have tasted in Singapore, and I have been to quite a few Indian restaurants here as I absolutely love Indian food. The waiter taking our order got one of the dishes wrong, however as soon as we mentioned this the staff were very helpful in rectifying the error and extremely speedy in delivering the correct food, so it was not an inconvenience at all. At the end of our dinner, one of the staff members came with complimentary dessert and apologised as he felt he had not delivered great service to us today, which was a surprise to us as even though there was a problem with the order their wonderful behaviour and efficiency meant we thought they had delivered beyond great service. Overall this is an authentic Indian restaurant with great tasting food and amazing staff who strive for perfection - definitely MUST visit when in Singapore!
5
Whenever we come to Sin we go to the same Indian restaurant and have been for years but this time we decided to take a trip advisor recommendation and go with curry culture - number 5 of 10000+ must be good and it certainly did not disappoint - food was terrific and service excellent - this will definitely be our new favourite 
5
The food, service and atmosphere were amazing. Try the aubergine with peanut - mouth wateringly good. The service was friendly and they gave us useful tips on places to shop. Prices similar to U.K. Menu also similar to U.K. But with a twist. Definitely a place worth visitin
5
Well I started looking for dinner about 3pm and decided on an Indian meal. It took me nearly two hours and a lot of reading reviews on trip advisor to decide on this restaurant. We were not disappointed. The staff were fantastic. The food whilst every restaurant has a different interpretation of each dish this restaurant certainly achieved the balance that was needed and were more than happy to accommodate where needed. If we were staying in Singapore I do think we would be back again the next day
5
The Curry Culture stand itself apart with its strong Indian taste and quality of food. We tried their1. barbecued cauliflower + cheese mushroom2. Masala fish curry3. Butter chicken curry4. Cheese and chilli Naan (bread)5. Masala Chai (milk tea) The Food was amazingly delicious and beautifully cooked to perfection. They are not cheap, but I agreed to other reviwers, The Curry Culture put their heart in each of the dish they offer. If you like great Indian food, give them a try! Really worth the price..
4
Smiling service backed by authentic Indian curries, Basmati and Naan made for an excellent meal. Medium price range.DM. Australia
5
Had a meal here tonight which was really delightful. Excellent butter chicken and barbecued chicken with saffron rice. A very tasty peshwari naan. All washed down with mango lassi and tiger beer. Very friendly and attentive service, all for a reasonable price
5
Came here many times to have a tiger and Indian food. Well cooked and good taste! Best in Singapore!
4
Compared to more 'local' curry options in SG, this is not cheap - but you would not expect it to be on Orchard Road. Really good range of interesting and very tasty dishes in the menu
4
I took my team here for our year-end dinner. We all love Indian food and had tried a few around town, but I stumbled on this one when looking for a new experience. I hadn't realized this was one of the highest rated restaurants in Singapore, not just amongst Indian cuisine. The food was very good. It was mainly Northern Indian cuisine, so we settled on two platters of tandoori offerings, which had a mix of chicken tandoori, prawn tandoori, chicken tikka, lamb kebobs and a fish kebob called macchi dil se. Everything was really tasty. We then tried different meat curries combined with cheese and veg curries. We accompanied these with garlic naan, which was a great complement to the rich and spicy dishes.We even tried the dessert, a mango Indian "ice cream" which was interesting and some traditional chocolate ice cream to clean our pallets.The down side was the wine offerings were not great, but they had a decent Tuscany red which we switched to after a mediocre Barossa Shiraz.Definitely one of the better Indian restaurants in town
4
I have been to this place so many times as I can remember. This place at Cuppage plaza, Orchard serves the best tomato shorba, April lady mock tail, and Indian food. I have been visiting this place with friends, Wife and colleagues. The hospitable waiters and the also they take care of taste of the food and immediately change if you feel something wrong. The price are in mid range and you can 10$ a beer pint as well. Smoking is allowed at specific tables. If you are looking for a good and decent Indian restaurant - this is the place to go.
4
Overall i liked the food and the place. Given its at cuppage on Orchard road, its noisy if take the seats outside. We had a team dinner here and overall the food served was good. The service was nice and i loved that the staff went beyond to customise food and drinks for one of our colleague who was following some religious routine.
5
This was my second attempt to dine at The Curry Culture and I finally got to dig into good Indian food.We arrived late for lunch,the staff was accommodating and allowed us to order our food. We ordered vegetable samosa and fish Amritsari for starter. The samosas were delicious and I had been deprived of these in a long time. The fish was also well made and food along with the green chutney. For the main course we ordered chicken tikka masala,dal tadka and Indian breads. The chicken tikka was good and dal tadka had best Indian flavours. The best thing was that the daal tastes absolutely fresh.The garlic naan was nice and crisp. The aloo paratha was well made and the stuffing was even in the paratha.The lunch overall was very delicious and I would recommend this place for good Indian food. I have not eaten Indian cuisine in Singapore anywhere else but this definitely is a must try. Pleas do try the aloo paratha
5
Went there with an Indian colleague and we're both impressed with the taste , presentation, service. Tuesday night is not the busiest , but you can tell that this restaurant is busier than dome of the neighbours - may want to consider making a reservation. Especially if you come at peak times, later in the week. Strongly recommend
5
After a tiring shopping day we came here for dinner. Craving for Indian food from days, we found this place with TripAdvisor's help! The ambience is area is very lively and food is icing on the cake!Suggestion simply pamper you taste buds. If you start converting yaha to itne ki hai India meiá¹… to kam ki ate thi you might kill the fun... and it was really good see people from other countries besides India having a good time here too!
5
This restaurant has become my 'local' Indian in Singapore. Staff are always helpful and honest when asked about the level of spice. Had a mild reaction one night and they could not have been more attentive. Tried a variety of the menu but love their butter chicken and Naan. Nice location outdoors but undercover and they also do takeaway.
5
So I met up with my cousins family for dinner. We made a reservation in advance just in case they were busy. We were sat inside due to a little child we had with us.Our waiter was Sanish who took our order without writing it down and it was spot on. For starters we had the papri chaat which was really good along with the Kathi chicken rolls. My cousin said it took him back to the days when he was in India. We ordered the malai chicken tikka, bhuna ghost and malabar fish curry. All 3 dishes were great full of flavour and the right amount of spice.Finished the evening with ghulam jamman and ice cream.The staff were very friendly and I think the owner was there too who was very polite and friendly.Only drawbacks I would say is that the service was a bit slow and it was quite smokey inside but trust me the food and the friendly service was great
5
Located next to orchard road, the restaurant is a part of a food court. A bit noisy for some but the food is every bit worth it. A good range of vegetarian variety. Excellent service and value for money.
5
Fantastic meal. Garlic nan was great and butter chicken was excellent. Service was very attentive. Will be back
5
We had the mutton vindaloo, one ladies finger curry and mixed vegetables curry. The portions are enough to share between 2 people. The price is on the higher end but considering the location (Cuppage), this is understandable. My husband and I went there for my birthday dinner. They surprised us with a brownie and a birthday song. The person in charge of our table, Sanish Ramachandran made sure that we were well taken care of. This was despite a busy dinner time on a weekday. The mango lassi was one of the best I have had and my birthday dinner was made very pleasant and enjoyable. I would definitely come back for future special occasions
5
After reading the reviews here, we went to this place with high expectations, and the place still exceeded what we were expecting. The food was really delicious and the April Lady drink was really refreshing. Besides the amazing food, the staff were very friendly. They even offered two small free fernis (dessert). We'll definitely go back there if we're in town
5
This restaurant has a great seating area outside in between other restaurants so the ambiance is really good. We ordered butter chicken, tadka dal, chicken tikka, onion baji, saffron rice, plain and cheese naan breads. The food was very tasty and well presented. I'm always pleasantly surprised when a waiter takes a drinks and large food order without writing it down and manages to get it all right! My only complaint would be the $15 for a glass of red wine (actually 1/2 a glass) but other than that the service was very good and the food reasonably priced. I would go back the next time i come to Singapore ;-
4
It's a very good Indian food place .... Not the touristy Indian greasy oily food !!Good outdoor seating & clearly the food is all freshly made . Dishes can be customised like we did since we wanted non spicy food .Highly recommended if you want good Indian food & not the run of the mill budget types
5
Fantastic food - beautiful flavours. Lots of complexity. And the service was brilliant- really warm and enthusiastic. Slight shame about the background noise - there were two bands performing simultaneously in the neighbouring bars, so all very discordant! However, don't let that put you off - you can sit inside and, besides which, the whole outdoor experience is great. There is a real buzz to the place.
4
We went to Curry culture on Diwali day. It was one of the few Indian restaurants open in Singapore that day. The Steward who took our order was very helpful. We are vegetarians and we found quite a variety to choose from. They served us very promptly too. We will definitely visit again.
5
Excellent quality north Indian food served at this restaurant. Good and efficient service. Price is bit on the higher side but looking at the location on Orchard Road, I guess it is ok. It would be wonderful if the portions could be a bit more though. On the whole, value for money
5
First off, this is in an open-air food court. Which starts the experience off right with the Hawker culture in Singapore. The minute I arrived the staff was welcoming and happy to help. I ordered the Butter Chicken and the Dal Makhani. They tasted exactly like I've had in India. Spicy, full of flavor, good portions, and they even gave me a 'bite' of a Mumbai street food delicacy. Glad my hotel and Trip Advisor steered me here.
5
I found this place via Trip Advisor. The tandoori lamb chops were phenomenal. Friendly service and very well priced. You won't eat better Indian than here
4
Had lunch with friends on a weekday where it tends to be quieter, and they served an excellent value for money set lunch. I had a lamb ghosh and a vegetarian curry, which were all very good. Service was good as well, with attentive staff.
4
Excellent service and wonderful food-- not the best value for money although not particularly pricey either
5
Very friendly and attentive staff. Great selection on the menu card, reasonable prices, good location.
3
Alas, the food was not nearly as good as I expected. Sorry. The sheek kebab was not freshly made and had a lot of unnatural colouring and the chicken jalfrezi was sweet (it seemed as if the chicken was mixed with tomato ketchup). The single chilli sign on the menu suggested it was meant to be spicy but it wasn't. The redeeming issue was that the waiter did change my chicken dish when I gave my immediate feedback. Great atmosphere was another redeeming fact.
5
A small jewel of tasty indian food somewhere in the middle of Singapore. I appreciated the beautiful presentation of meals, and distinctive savors. Highly recommended
4
They had 17++ lunch deals which turned out to be a good choice. There was a soup, followed by 2 main dishes which you can choose from menu. Non vegetarians are allowed to choose 2 non veg dishes, it comes with Dal, 1 bread and rice followed by small portion of dessert.I ordered Chicken Jalfrezi and Bhuna Mutton, while chicken was tasty but they put too much Colour in it which later even after washing hands with soap didn't go, just wondering what it will do inside your tummy. Anyways Mutton dish was fresh and tasted ok.We had to order extra bread as one is not enough. Also they served only One Dal and only 1 portion of rice among two of us, not sure why.Service was very slow but very polite and attentive, definitely 5 star.Dessert was Kheer (Rice and Milk Pudding) which was so good that we ended up ordering Ala-Carte.. Lol
5
This place was the best Indian food. The staff were so welcoming. The owner had lived in Sydney for years,and was very nice to us. He gave us a complimentary entree.Overall the price was very reasonable. But as with all restaurants in Singapore, alcohol is quite expensive
5
We have had a lot of curries in a lot of places and this has to be one of the best.The service was very very good, attentive, but not overbearing. The orders were taken in a reasonable amount of time and drinks and food served in a timely manner.The food was fantastic, I normally do not order fish as Indian restaurants as it is normally over cooked, but this fish (in fact two different dishes), was cooked to perfection, it is a credit to the chef.The lamb and other dishes were also a delight
5
We were staying at holiday inn in singapore and had been going to little india a number of times for our craving of indian food..however on our last day of songapore we discovered this place on cuppage road which was right behind our hotel and we absolutely loved it!!we had ordered chole,dal and tandoori chicken and every dish was just perfect!the chole was one of the best i have ever tasted and the tandoori chicken was great too...the staff and the owner prashant were courteous and really friendly..totally worth a visit!
4
I went to this restaurant by myself on a business trip. Very enjoyable and very friendly staff. The food was great and they serve a great range of curries. It's not the cheapest restaurant but definitely worth a visit
5
All the dishes we had were excellent. But the most special was the chicken tikka appetizer. The chicken is marinated in whiskey and flamed at the table, very spectacular, and the best kebabi tikka I ever had. The spiciness of the food is a bit adapted to Singapore taste so with the Vindaloo we could have taken a bit higher grade than the safe number 1. Good whines to match the dishes and good service. Too many dishes to choose from is the only problem we had.
4
Dined here for lunch solo after reading the TripAdvisor reviews. I had prawn curry recommended by my server. The curry itself was wonderful (although I would probably get another protein). Wine selection was pretty limited and the one I selected was not available, so I just had a beer. Service was extremely friendly and attentive. I do recommend going with a larger party in order to sample a few more dishes. Prices are on the higher side, but for the ambiance and service worth it
5
Actually selected this restaurant based on TripAdvisor reviews (first time), certainly not disappointed, The Curry Culture deserves its rating. Food was delicious, very good service, waiter knew the menu and gave appropriate advice.Also, Cuppage Terrace has really good ambience, nice place to eat.PS: watch out for the spice level in the lamb Vindaloo, since we like spicy we were planning on specifying a 7 (range is 1-10), advised to try a 4, went for a 5 and it was just (hot) right
5
Popped in on a Tuesday night (no booking) and was welcomed by Prashan whom we had met the night before whilst checking out the number of eateries in this precinct.Welcoming Explained the menu Menu - a great variety of dishes on offer. We opted for the Butter Chicken, Lamb Korma, prawn dish, a Cheese and Keema Naan and Saffron Rice - and we were not disappointed. Tasty, delicious cuisine. Perhaps a couple of more pieces of chicken and lamb dishes would not have gone astray to feed four. Plus some additional rice. Offered a small dessert platter on the house - thank you! Yum!!Wines, Beers and Softdrinks and Juices available. Not sure about prices for bottles of wine in Singapore, but the cheapest was $55. A little expensive compared to comparable Australian licences restaurants. Tap water wasn't charged for Ambience - shared deck area with adjoining restaurants and some live music a couple of bays away, so was a little noisy on this occasion, but was clean and presentable. Prices - reasonable, not inexpensive. Probably suggest serving size be slightly modified (increased) for the prices, as mentioned above.Overall the table service was excellent and the food matched the service - highly recommended. We certainly would return
5
The meal was fabulous, I never experienced such a tasty and delicate mix of spices, up to the mango ice cream..
5
Had random dinner here, just best indian food what we have had. We were just lucky, didn't know that this is top 5 restaurant in singapore :)Servise is also great.
5
Eat here 3 times in one week tells you something. Conveniently close to the Holiday Inn hotel where I was staying for the week. The food is excellent quality. The boss always greeted me in a friendly manner. My only complaint is the portions could be larger.
5
After 5 weeks in Southeast Asia we were happy to break from the traditional food and Curry Culture was the best Indian food since we visited India 7 years ago. Perfect flavors and good service. The manager spoke to us during and after the meal! It was not cheap but it was wonderful.
5
All staff welcoming and alert, restaurant clean and well appointed.Jimmy is an eagle on the front of house, every good restaurant needs one.Food was good and quick, Saag Ghost very good, a bit more kick would have made me even happier.Cheese nan very cheesy and paratha good.Pints of draught beer on happy hour a happy combination.I shall be back, maybe to Robinson Quay first hoping this is as good
5
My mum and I really enjoyed our meal here after reading good reviews we weren't disappointed. The staff were so helpful with their menu suggestions and attentive service. Papadums & dips at the start were scrumptious. Make sure you leave space for a cocktail (mango was delicious). We sat inside as it was pretty loud out & it was lovely. You can't go wrong with a meal here
5
Although the service was a little slow but the food was top notch. The ambience was very good.Located in cuppage terrace, amongst some other restaurants the area is nice, was busy and had a good vibe.The lamb was the same as the owner serves in his own home to guests and was amazing.The shrimp had a light coconut that did not overpower the curry
5
Really good food and extensive menu. Friendly and helpful service and food well cooked, hot and spicy. Highly recommended if you want decent food at a reasonable pric
5
Great food and great service. Definitely one for a return trip. If you like it hot and spicy ask for level 6 at least.
5
Eat there with family. The staff guided us nicely in our choices. The curry was one of the nicest I had so far. Good value for money comparing to other places we were during our stay. The location is nice
5
We found this place on trip advisor and glad we did! We flew in from Syd late & thought we'd be lucky to find something open. The whole Cuppage Rd precinct is pretty cool. The service was great and food awesome. We had the onion bajie, malai kofta, butter chicken & paratha. The complimentary papadums & dips were a nice touch. A bit $$$ for Indian but standard Singapore fare. We would highly recommend this place :-)
5
My husband and I are both fans of Indian food and made several trips to Little India. Too tired to go anywhere one evening, we tried Curry Culture as it was a short walk from our hotel. It was outstanding! Spices are distinct but don't overwhelm the dish. The Butter Chicken was excellent as was the Samarkandi prawns. Complimentary papadam was inhaled in no time. We ended up eating there a second time with the same solid results. I headed back to the States but my husband had another month's work there -- declaring that this was his new go-to restaurant
5
Found this gem of a place by other trip advisor reviews and we were so pleased we did. The owner advised us on the food and we had the most amazing starter followed by the best lamb masala and chicken jalfrezi with saffron rice and a peshwari naan bread. We can honestly say this was one of the most delicious curries we have ever had full of flavour. The staff here are very attentive and friendly and the owner so sorry cannot remember his name comes out and talks to you which was really nice. If your looking for authentic Indian food go you will not be disappointed
5
The Curry Culture is my "go-to" Indian restaurant in Singapore. Whether I'm bringing overseas guests or just want to take my adult children out for a treat, I can always count on the delicious curries, superb service, and fantastic al fresco fun. (The live music from the tapas bar next door doesn't hurt!) We will keep coming to The Curry Culture!! (Ask Sandeep for recommendations - he was spot on!)

The food is very good with plenty of choices to suit all appetites. The spiciness of the food can also be adapted to suit the individual taste. There are also specials on the menu worth a try. Happy hour is an added attraction for few beers as well. The staff are attentive and informative on the food offering suggestions. The locality of the restaurant make it convenient for Orchard Road. The area is busy on Saturday nights with all the bars full from 8pm onwards

I love a good curry - well, I'm British, so it goes without saying :o)I only discovered The Curry Culture a year ago, after living in Singapore for over 13 years, but I wish I'd checked it out sooner!The staff are friendly and helpful, the range of excellent dishes always means we can try something new each time we visit, although there are some absolute favourites that we just can't stop ourselves from ordering.The Keema Mattar - minced lamb and peas - is exquisite, the Bhindi Do Pyaaza is also a winner and the Vindaloo Curry is delicious - you can choose the heat level of this dish from 1 to 10, we usually go for the 3 or 4, which is spicy enough without masking the rest of the flavours. If you're up for a challenge and you love tongue melting heat, see how far up this scale you can go...I'm salivating as I write this, so no doubt I'll be heading back down to The Curry Culture very soon

Went here last night with my wife and son and had chicken korma andChicken Jalfrezi which had the nicest sauces I have tasted ever .Beers are expensive but what isn't in Singapore .wii return if on town 
5
Vindalo (heat 7) always a favorite. Cold drinks, friendly service & the rest of the menu is great too
5
We ate at the Curry Culture tonight and it was brilliant, best Indian meal we have had. The staff were very friendly and there was a great atmosphere with live music playing at a location further down the street (we sat outside). They had a huge gluten free selection (apart from naan breads) which tasted excellent. Would really recommend it.
5
We visited this restaurant because of tripadvisor. It's located on a very nice restaurant strip. I am not fimiliar with indian and they talked us through the menu. good service. The chance of an empty glass in this restaurant is zero. They will try to sell a lot but that;s there job ! The food is very tasty, from the samosa's to the curry's.it's a bit pricey 150 USD for 2 persons, will visit again !
5
This is a fabulous place in a great eating area. It is open air but covered and plenty of fans to keep everyone cool. Just off the bottom end of Orchard Road, there must be at least 12 restaurants here and there is live music and a great atmosphere all round. The food at Curry Culture is amazing and we rate it as the best curry we have ever had and that is saying something because me must eat curry at least once per fortnight. Nothing was too much trouble and they were happy to substitute prawns instead of chicken in one of their signature dishes. Really, really good
5
Very delicious, service excellent and the tiger beer was a real refreshment after a long sightseeing tour
5
We were recommended this restaurant by friends and it did not disappoint, we had the samosa and khati rolls both tasty and then the fish curry and butter chicken all very good. Service good and friendly would go back agai
5
The rice here is the best I've ever had..light and fluffy. Service was perfect and the food was delectable. Can't fault it
4
Really tasty meal and friendly staff. We'd just arrived in Singapore so jet lag for the better of us with 2 of the 4 kids falling asleepPortions are small but very well made. Thankfully as the kids were so tired me and the good lady got to eat the kids meals that were left - they were very good quality for a children's menu.Nice location and ambience - alcohol was expensive but that is just Singapore
5
It's a smooth operation. From "would you like to dine with us tonight" to being seated, given water, Papadums and dips to having the menu explained. Equally smart and unique after all the Indian restaurants I've dined in was the technique used for deciding the vexed question of "when you say hot, how hot" would you like it. The waiter used my view of the hottest dip to judge my preference. I'm pleased he did. Relative to most people I know, I love my Indian food hot and spicy. It came out perfect. When he came to check he told me the heat was 2 out 10.Outside It's maybe not the location for a long romantic dinner, but it is fast without being rushed, friendly and the food very tasty. I will be bac
4
Nice food and setting, very attentative staff. The cocktail was so so, not enough alcohol and a bit scary in color. Food was however really nice and tasty.
5
Have been here so many times and the food is always very good. The staff are so friendly and efficien
4
A simple lunch with my daughter, who is in Hotel management, (and therefore a great critic!) turned out to be a pleasant experience for the two of us.Attentive , polite, not-so pushy staff let us take our time with menu choices, while also suggesting good alternativesBest of all was the personal touch by the chef, who went table by table to ask if everything was ok.Dessert was excellen
4
The curry culture in Singapore was just behind our hotel that is why it was our first choice on that day. Food was excellent ( curry, beryani & checkin malay)But, next day I had to visit the toilet many times. Service was excellentStaff were so friendly Price was just all Singapore very pricey
4
Super food..very good quality..I will go back for sure. The staff are very nice and informative about the food they serve
5
The food was fabulous, especially the crab stuffed tandoori prawns- a great way to start the meal. The friendly service from Prashan and also chatting to Sandeep about the spirit of the restaurant and cricket in India made the evening a highlight of our trip. We will be back.
4
A restaurant situated at the city center very close to Orchard street. Has a nice covered alley in front of the restaurant that one can enjoy the food there. The lamb korma was really good! Overall it was a nice experience! Recommended
5
We got delivery and it was excellent. We are regular curry eaters and the quality of the dishes were excellent. Highly recommended.
5
Service is good and tasty fare! Nice place to have a good Indian fare over conversations with friends and family! But better to ask for suggestions as starter portions are bigger than normal size
4
Plain naans with marsala chicken and chicken tikka were very tasty. Marsala chicken is slightly creamy side compared to chicken tikka, both are spicy but give the different sensation. Boyfriend & I prefer chicken tikka more though. Service team was great that day, they are attentive to our needs and would chat with guests to gather feedback about dining experience. Papadum served before mains are nice, chickpeas dip is especially great
4
We were in Singapore for one week and eat out every night. We tried a couple of different curries, patek paneer and naan bread. Food was very good, good portions, service was fast, definitely the best Indian food i have had so far in Singapore.
5
Well worth its position. Location is unbeatable - right on orchard. In the Centre of everything ! Sandeep and prashant are super hosts :). They both go above and beyond. The service is like the ritz Carlton. Food is delicious and menu is extensive. We had fish curry - yummy and spinich lamb - wow but by far the paneer Tanwa was the star !!!
4
The service and setting are very nice. I had the chat appetizer and it was excellent. The main did not impress me much, though. It was a fairly tasty curry but nothing that impressed me greatly, and it seemed to be based on tomato paste. By all means go if you are nearby, but there is no way that this is one of the top restaurants in all of Singapore, which the Trip Advisor rating would seem to suggest
5
First I'll get the IT review out of the way. Trying to input a reservation request through the web site led to the error message that my "last name is invalid". Fortunately, e-mail works just fine and my lunch request came through. Second problem is that there are two Curry Culture restaurants that are not well distinguished on the website, and only one (not the one I walk 4 km from my hotel to get to) is open for lunch. So...a phone call and a cab ride later, that problem was solved.So, the five star review is based on the restaurant, not the website, and once I finally got to the right one (off Orchard Road), it was one of the best Indian meals of my life. Service was incredibly friendly from Sandeep, who picked my brain as to whether it was really possible that Donald Trump could be elected president. They offer an incredible bargain for lunch, consisting of a one-bite appetizer, mulligatawny soup, dal, garlic naan, rice, two kinds of curry, and a dessert, all for 17SGD. Incredible! For my troubles, they threw in an extra vindaloo lamb curry, and I could hardly walk when I left. To judge the how spicy to make the vindaloo, Sandeep asked how I found the tomato chili dip that came with some puppadom (not very), so he amped up the vindaloo.All in all, a great experience
4
Thank you to Persham for his warm welcome. He was so kind to explain to us the menu and the tradition. All the food we have tried was excellent, fresh and tasty. I really recommend this Indian restaurant, is fine also for the Italian taste. Thank you
4
For this who like a good curry, good well rounded curries with no skimping on the meat or fish, the service is great and not too pushy - reasonably priced and very popular with British Ex-Pats as well as the locals - the Roti is well made and light
5
Warmly welcomed by Jimmy, who sat us inside away from the hustle and bustle of Cuppage Terrace on a Friday night. Jimmy looked after us so well, we had such an amazing dining experience compared to our previous evening. Our meals were the best curries we had ever tasted, so fresh and spicy, beers were ice cold, Jimmy also served us a few little treats along the way which were exquisite. We left very happy and very full
5
Found this place since it was ranked very high on Trip Advisor (#10 in SG at the time).Looked the menu online, but it contained no prices (which I didnt like). If you are wondering, curry dishes are prices d around S$22-26, house wine was S$13.Ordered a curry chicken (mild) dish with naan which was very good! I would strongly recommend it.Ambience was quite modern, it is not a traditional Indian place. Service was excelent.Overall, a very good experience, 5/5
5
Found this place on trip advisor. It's in a Great location not far from Somerset MRT stop. Butter Chicken curry was beautiful!
5
My family and I love Indian food. We currently live in Japan (though we're American), and Indian food has become our go-to comfort food. We have amazing restaurants in Tokyo, but nothing compared to this place. The curry is incredible. The customer service is equally as incredible as the food. The entire staff treated us so well, even my cranky 2 year old daughter. They gave us a surprise appetizer to try (which was amazing), and took the time to talk to us. Please, just go here. You won't be disappointed. Our only regret is only being able to go here once on our trip.
5
During our visit in Singapour we tried to locate a nice Indian restaurant in town and we have found Curry Culture on the web. Very nice food and very friendly and good service. Also at very reasonnable price. Highly recommended.
5
To quote my husband, "that was the best curry I have ever eaten". And that's a LOT of currys. ..To echo the sentiments of most on here, fabulous ambience, friendly greeting, helpful service (they won't let you over order), delicious wine, lovely staff who don't intrude, but above all..... delicious, colourful, tasty food.Best naan bread I have ever tasted, and I like to consider myself a 'naan connoisseur' .Jimmy the owner (not his real name he tells me), proudly handed us his business cards, and he should be proud. This place is awesome. And as Arnie said.... "I'll be back".HIGHLY RECOMMEND
4
Whether these are the best curries in Singapore I can't say but they are delicious, generously sized portions presented by friendly and entertaining staff so there is nothing not to like. The setting of the restaurant is bustly and noisy but that adds to the general fun experience. We booked and the place was busy so it seems like that is a good idea
3
Positives - great staff ! , considerable food quantity. So, just order some items and let them come to your table so that you can estimate and order the rest. Their signature juice was great ! Negatives - the soup we ordered was a lentil soup. It smelled like it's gone stale.. maybe many veggie eaters don't visit the place and so they have stale stuff ? Not sure. Rest of the dishes were like 60/100. We did not try the meat dishes though. Shall we visit again ? Maybe but definitely try some non-veg instead of veg
5
We are quite addicted to Curry Culture on Cuppage Terrace because- the staff are helpful and unobtrusive. They remember us when we return- the butter chicken is delicious and plenteous: enough for two to share- the location is in the center of Orchard Road- their cheese naans are filled with such tasty cheese- we can eat inside or outside- the quality of the food and service is consistent and reliable- the price is eminently reasonable for the food, location and service- they are open from 11 to 11, so we can eat a late lunch there- after eating, we can shop on Orchard Road with a delightful satisfied feelingWhen we want a relaxing lunch or dinner experience that will never disappoint, Curry Culture is the first restaurant that has come to mind since we discovered it in 2013
5
We called in for a light lunch and found the fixed price lunch a great deal: choose two curries (one meat/fish, the other vegetarian) and enjoy with poppadums, rice, naan etc. Good quality food and excellent servic
4
We passed by this restaurant 3 times before deciding to give it ago. I must say the customer service was great. My son gotten free ice cream after his dinner. We got extra yogurt to counter the spiciness of khema mataar. I wished i did asked if the lebanese lamb was made of the red sauce and spicy!! hubby ordered tandoori chicken which was great.i will come again, but will have a look at the menu properly. The khema mataar is not of what we were used to, extremely spicy for me. and the lebanese with aubergine is a no no. All the naan and romali roti was grea
4
Nicely located in Cuppage Road, this place stands out for India food lovers.Dishes both vegetarian and non-veg were delicious and icing on cake was a very courteous staff
5
I was looking for a halal restaurant and I went to the curry culture located in the cuppage terrace, very nice place full of restaurants , but actually this is the BEST INDIAN Food i had ever eat .... Very very delicious food , portions are very good , the staff is nice , list of varieties are available ...... i tried the chicken butter which is the one that i can rely on to rate any indian restaurant and i was SHOCKED because this was the BEST ONE ever ... I recommend this restaurant to every one who step in Singapor
5
非常謝謝餐廳推薦菜色，給我們這麼好的印度菜體驗。雞肉咖哩與蒜味餅皮的搭配非常好吃，芒果椰子薄荷口味的飲料也是一個絕妙的混搭。如果您想試試好的印度料理，我會推薦這家餐廳。Thank you for giving us a wonderful experience. The curry butter chicken and garlic naan are fantastic. And the mango coconut with mint cold drink is also an excellent taste. It's a very good restaurant and I would recommend The Curry Culture if you want to try nice Indian cuisine
5
This is a place where you really feel like it's your best friend who is serving you food. They gave us information about india's different foods and helped us pick out just the right ones. This was really a food-experience. If I travel back to Singapore I will definently visit again!

This is my third review for The Curry Culture. We don't dine out that often in SG but when we decided to take my husband's colleague (who landed here just a couple of months back) out for dinner on his birthday, we couldn't think of a better place than this for Indian food. While the food is great, the top-notch service is what persuades us to come back here every time. The service standards are still good - the staff is warm with a pleasant disposition, and the food doesn't take much time to arrive on the table after ordering.We ordered a tandoori platter and paneer tikka for starters - the seekh kebab and fish on this platter were excellent. Their paneer tikka is well-seasoned and the cottage cheese is very soft.For drinks, we ordered 2 Indian Summers (could have been better) and a Lime Margarita (which was done very well!).The main course consisted of Dal Makhni (which was fine), Kadhai Sabzi/Mixed Veg Curry (5 STARS for that! It was spicy and SO flavorful..wow!), Bhuna Gosht (which was nice), butter naans and plain rice. The butter naans were a tad disappointing, as The Curry Culture has the best naans in town, which are so soft - but on this visit we found that it wasn't the usual fare but nevertheless, still much better than what is served in other places.But Mr Sachar - we were extremely disappointed with the Jal Jeera. In my previous reviews too I had mentioned that this place has the BEST Jal Jeera ever. We love the Jal Jeera here so much that when we went in for a second round of drinks, we felt that it would be terrible to dine here and not order that drink. So I ordered the Jal Jeera while my husband requested if the Coke in his and his friend's IIT/LIIT could be replaced with the Jal Jeera!But what we were served this time was a different version. The color was totally different, the taste was nowhere close to the usual drink you served....it was synthetic, bland and a letdown. Would really appreciate if your restaurant went back to the version being served last year...thank you. We rounded off the meal with two rasmalais - which were delicious. The friend was delighted with the meal, after weeks of average-to-terrible Indian food he has sampled in the city.Overall, a good meal with some excellent dishes and a couple of misses
5
Great night with the family. We had an several dishes, Butter Chicken, Coconut Prawns and Lamb. The flavours were vibrant and rich. Oh cause the meal would not be as awesome without the CC Margareta Jugs. You have to ask for Lisa's blend as the bar will add more Contreau which really differs cites CC's Margarita's.
5
Found this gem by mistake, but thank heavens we did. Genuine Indian food with amazing flavour and fantastic service. Price was fair for the quality we received. We were so happy with our visit we returned again a few nights later and received the same great food and service. Highly recommended!
5
Had an amazing experience with the Masala Prawn, Lamb and Nan. The shrimp had a light coconut that did not overpower the curry. The lamb was the same as the owner serves in his own home to guests and was amazing. My friend said that this is the closest taste of India he has had since in India. Got the opportunity to chat with the owner that is from India which was a treat. Will definitely be returning to explore the vast menu.
4
Visited after seeing some great reviews on here. Located in cuppage terrace, amongst some other restaurants the area is nice, was busy and had a good vibe.Staff were friendly and attentive and explained some of the dishes and pushed us to try some new tastes. All of which were great, good portions and seemed well made
4
Typical Indian, in covered food court just off somerset and orchard. We sat outside under fan, so held on to table mats.. Service was good, food was ok, Standard but the locals recommend Sammy's or Rang Mahal.. Not cheap, 4 of us,65 a pop..
5
Stayed in Singapore for 7 days. As we are vegetarian, we preferred to eat Indian food there. Tried different restaurants but found Curry Culture to be the best. Went there twice. Although the service was a little slow but the food was top notch. The ambience was very good. We went there twice during our stay and enjoyed the food thoroughly both times.Much better than host of South Indian vegetarian restaurants in Singapore. Must try
5
Great customer service, great food with family, the people are very nice they are always checking on the people if they're okay and if we need anything, price is reasonable as well.
4
Dropped in for a meal very attentive service & food was as very good Indian home made style.Well priced & very busy eatery area Cannot fault our nite so the rating is a bit low really, atmosphere is casual & not five star .. Tip eat alfresco
4
We went as a couple for spicy Indian food. This place is a delight food is good especially my husband fish curry, it's spicy not oily refreshing to our taste bud. I also liked my tomato butter vegetable, the manager attending to our table was extremely pleasant. We like the food the ambience and the service. A good start of our holiday trip.
5
Went x 2 timesboth food choices were fantastic!good value for excellent foodsat outside although you can sit inside where it is cooler.Manager and staff, made out night they were lovely peopl
5
Situated in the Cuppage complex right outside the Holiday Inn Orchard City, Curry Culture offers fine cuisine in a relaxed atmosphere. The service was prompt with plenty of advice on what to eat depending on your taste. That said, there was no pressure to order anything I didn't want to. Customary poppadoms were followed by a butter chicken dish and keema naan. Very nice indeed. It was more than enough for me and I loved every bit of it. Worth a visit if you're in the area.
5
I've had Indian on 3 continents (NA, Europe, Asia) and this was the best I've had. The owner came over to chat and told me about his philosophy (make the kind of fresh delicious food he enjoyed growing up in India). I went back a 2nd time on only a 5-day trip, so you know I liked it. I had butter chicken, naan, traditional raita, rice the first night and mutton tikka masala, paratha, chickpea raita the second night. Had a delicious mango mocktail too. I sat in the outside dining area both nights (busy, lots to see and hear) and got great attentive service. I would eat here once a week if I lived in Singapore. Can't say enough good things about it
4
We were late for dinner and although past 10pm the closing time ...the restaurant manager was kind enough to take our order....very good service...the rogan ghosh(lamb curry) and butter chicken was very nice....good affordable indian food and very good service..do try the rogan ghosh
5
Had dinner there tonite and we were very happy with the meals we received.Sensational flavoursome curries served with great customer service. Well doneWill be back when we are next in Singapore Best regardsGary and Doreen Perth wa

Visiting the Curry Culture for the first time this week and it lived up to all expectations. The Cuppage St. alfresco setting is great, with live music coming from the bar nearby adding a pleasant soundtrack to the evening. Quickly after seating we were brought poppodoms and dips. The dips were very nice although the popodoms were too soft so had probably not been freshly prepared.We ordered drinks and a lamb samosa starter. The spiced samosa were tasty although very dry and I used the mint dip to add some moisture to the dish which worked well. We did tell the waiter of this but he confirmed they were as they should be.For mains we orders the Lamb Biryani and the Butter Chicken.... The service was good and they discussed how hot we wanted each dish. Both dishes were very tasty and spiced as we had requested. The Butter chicken was exceptional.Any left overs were kindly packed to take home and we both left full after a very nice evening.Overall there was nothing new here and the menu will not excite you; but it's all cooked well the meat is very good and the nice setting and good service make it definitely worth a visit
3
Considering the score on trip advisor this was disappointing, tried in April at Robertson quay which was to be honest poor however stayed off orchard road this month and give a different venue a go, should have learnt, curry dishes needed gravy/sauce to be less paste like which spoil the overall meal, no positive comment from staff in terms of "well this is how we do it or sorry" certainly will not make the same mistake again, Sorry Curry culture
5
Excellent curry with rich flavours and spices. I was dining alone and they happily provided half-sized serves so I could try two different curries - I had the bhuna gosht and butter chicken and both were delicious and full of flavour. A lovely environment sitting outside on the terrace. Total price $57 for one person including curry, saffron rice, naan, pint of beer (plus got a second one free on happy hour), and free poppadom and chutney. This was more food than was required for one person so 'per head' price would be cheaper as a group. I would definitely return, and have also kept a copy of their takeaway menu :
5
I have been fortunate enough to visit many Indian restaurants across the world, including in India, Brazil, England, USA and many more countries and this certainly ranks up there with the best.The service was very good, staff were attentive without being pushy and food and drinks were served quickly. Waiters were happy and friendly which always helps with any experience also.The food itself was fantastic, I prefer white meat (breast) and the waiter accommodated my request. The taste was fantastic, the curry was spicy without being over the top, and I was very surprised, but happy, to find that the portion sizes were very big. Despite being full, I just had to finish the exquisite food in front of me. I went for the murgh tikka masala, keema naan and white rice. I would not have changed anything, and if I had time I would love to go back and see if all of their dishes match up to this quality.The only slight improvements I would consider is that the price is a bit higher than those in Little India (although quality here is better), and even though I didn't mind, the fans outside were a bit strong.Overall a 5 star experience and if you are anywhere on Orchard Road and want a good curry, I would recommend nowhere higher than The Curry Culture
4
A superb out-door type Indian Cuisine, at affordable price in the mid orchard road, surrounded by various high-end Shopping Malls of Orchard Singapore.
Food is better than most of the similar types of restaurants.
4
Based on the positive reviews on this very site, a friend and I went to Curry Culture to enjoy some Indian food. We were both pleased with the few dishes we could share as a party of two, with the lamb jalfrezi being our favorite. It was intensely spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. That said, it makes you wonder how hot the vindaloo aspires to be. The service was very warm and welcoming. Despite all the hype, we left as very pleased customers
5
a small cosy restaurant, has outside tables nice if weather permits, tables inside with AC. Service very personalised, owner/manager personally caring for details. Food was delicious, with good variety. A bit expensive for the usual Indian dinner rates but on the whole a place to be recommended
5
The food was amazing, the staff is really good, just follow their recommendations, the butter chicken is out of this world, and if you think you can handle spicy then try the Vindaloo Curry, i suggest level 10
4
You're always a little wary when a restaurant gets such good reviews that it will live up to the hype. We chose The Curry Culture because it was the highest ranked Indian restaurant on Tripadvisor. We weren't disappointed. Service was top notch with the person in charge even going above and beyond by providing little things for us to try that we hadn't ordered - very much appreciated. The food was full of flavour and the size of the meals perfect. An added bonus of The Curry Culture is that it sits in Cuppage Terrace which has been developed into a lovely little food hub with outside tables and chairs creating a great dining atmosphere. Thanks for the night The Curry Culture - keep doing what you do well
5
I'm in Singapore for business and I had the opportunities to try this rest. Long service, but fantastic food, sign that was not prepared in advance (as many other place!). Butter chicken was awesome and the check was in line with the expectation (not much!). Enjoy
4
We chose Curry Culture for our dinner during a stopover in Singapore and were not disappointed. They have a great variety of tandoori and curry classics as well as a few less known options. We have tried two curries, both with very rich structure and taste. Drinks, naans, etc were also prepared to perfection.The service was impeccable with very attentive and approachable waiters, happy to have a bit of small talk too!Ambiance is great, both indoors (more quiet and romantic) and outdoors (with more vibrant vibe due to other bars / restaurants located on the same terrace. All in all a very good Indian dining experience. A bit on the pricey side, yet this is what one can expect in Singapore
5
Visited with my mom during a recent trip to Singapore. This restaurant came recommended by a friend of a friend and did not disappoint. Delicious palak paneer & vindaloo curry! The service was excellent. Highly recommend
4
Had two dinners in quick succession as I wasn't sure the place was up to snuff the first time. It was! I am not sure I would rate it as THE BEST north Indian restaurant in Singapore (as it currently seems to be; MTR serves south Indian food). But, it is still very, very good. Even appetisers like samosas are pretty good, as are most of the kebabs. One thing to note though: the portions are much smaller than what you get at most Indian restaurants, so you may end up ordering more stuff, which adds to the bill. This may explain why - as others here have noted - you may end up paying more here (budget about $50-60 per person)
5
If you're looking for a great Indian restaurant in Singapore now there are two Curry Cultures! I discovered one on my last visit to Singapore (The Curry Culture 31, Cuppage Road ) and now they has another location at 60 Robertson Quay, next to where the new Singapore Intercontinental is being built. My host Jimmy Matthew and his team put on a fantastic spread for me. It's right on the Waterfront and seriously a top spot if you like Indian food. And who doesn't? Thanks Jimmy Matthew
4
People very like to weekend entertainment and taste of variety foods.
tasty food of all aged peoples.
5
Went at lunchtime and decided to order the lunch special, soup of the day (Mulligatawny), your choice of any veg plus any non-veg curry, served with dal, rice, & naan bread. Includes dessert, all for $17 Sing, including tax & service. Outstanding food and a great value. Service was a leisurely, but wasn't in a hurry so that wasn't a problem. Great wait staff. If you enjoy Indian food, don't miss this place! It's tucked away behind the CentrePoint, just off Orchard Road
1
I returned one week later to eat again,and I ordered THE SAME Fabulous dishes that I had described in my previous posting in February 2016.( Trip Advisor DID NOT ALLOW an immediate follow up posting on the same establishment, there was a one-month sit out delay )This time, the prepared dishes TASTED NOTHING LIKE the previous Fabulous visit one week ago. I DID NOT ENJOY ANY OF THE DISHES on this occasion.I understand ALL my dishes were cooked by a different cooking staff on this occasion.As a dining customer, I am EXTREMELY disappointed and TOTALLY LET DOWN by such a VAST DIFFERENCE in standard of cooking in the same outlet.I am PUT OFF EVER RETURNING and taking a hit-and-miss chance.OVER 90 dollars (for one person) spent for food I DID NOT ENJOY is not good value.I will however always remember I had ONE Fabulous evening dining with you
5
We loooooved it! It's in a food court, nice seating outside. And you can walk through the kitchen inside!!!I think the most part is done by the manager who helped us select the dishes paying a lot of attention to our needs. The fish of the day was fantastic. We had the king shrimps (amazing) and the spicy and mild lamb. As a dessert we had the hot cheese combined with icecream... Strongly recommended... We were happy to have listened!I would strongly recommend the place!!
4
Went there with my husband for an early dinner. Food was great and service good too. I had the vegetarian eggplant curry
4
Recently tried this place on a Thursday evening. Their overly florid menu descriptions nearly evoked outright laughter, but do show a certain charm. Very wide selection and everything sounded tasty. Ended up ordering the Malabar prawns, dal makhani and a basmati rice. Well prepared and the right amount of spice. Warm service. Great overall experience. Just way overpriced for what it is (by at least 2x). My 2 curries, plain rice and a pint of Tiger came out to nearly $60! I'll be back when someone else is paying the bill. It would be a solid 5 if not for the poor value
5
Visited restaurant in the evening with the family, service was excellent and staff helped with all dietary requirements. Would definitely recommend
5
This has to be one of the best curries I've had for a very long time. I ordered a lamb jalfrasi level 2 and it was perfect (the level 3 I ordered at another restaurant a few days earlier was a bit too spicy for me)The staff were very informative, friendly and helpful and the service good. My wife had a mild butter chicken that was also just to her liking. We shared a garlic naan bread and a bowl of saffron rice. The portion sizes we decent but we ended up ordering another bowl of rice - not because we were hungry but because we wanted to stretch the meal out to savor the delicious sauces. We ended the meal with a desert platter to share - the fried cheese ball in honey syrup was a winner!Highly recommend and would have gone back if we had more time.Tip: If you eat between 5pm and 7 pm certain drinks (beers and some spirits) are cheaper during "happy hour"

I flew into Singapore this evening on business and am staying in a hotel just round the corner. A quick check on Trip Advisor showed this as by far the highest rated restaurant nearby. I'd have to say the ratings are well deserved. I started with Tillisimi Jhinga (deep fried prawns coated with sesame seeds) which came with a wicked chilli and garlic dip. Main was Saag Gosht (lamb and spinach curry) with a couple of naan. The lamb was incredibly tender and flavourful, with a well balanced sauce. One of the best Indian meals I've eaten in years
5
Am here now and it is fantastic - the food is brilliant and the Maitre'd is so friendly and helpful. This is also a great "food street" with entertainment and real atmosphere - will definitely come back here and thoroughly recommend it. One down side is cost of wine... Oyster Bay Sauv B. is £7.50 a bottle in UK - it's £60 here..

Lovely Lunch. Great service with a smile. Reasonable prices. Great location, sat outside. I only had a starter since on a diet. Food was great and more than I really needed.

After seeing the great reviews this restaurant had, it was on my list of places to eat while we were in Singapore and it did not disappoint at all. Easy to find just off of Orchard road with outdoor and inside dining available.We arrived feeling a bit jet lagged and starving hungry, we left with full bellies and loads of energy to keep exploring.We had some yummy vegetarian samosas to start, then butter chicken and tikka masala for our mains along with naan bread. The curries were full of flavour, rich thick sauces and tender meat. Garlic & cheese naans were delicious and I made sure I soaked up every last bit of sauce :-)Staff were so polite and friendly, always making sure your glasses were full and checking all the food was ok.I didn't get the restaurant hosts name sorry (he was telling us he used to live in Sydney years ago) but he was so nice and made us feel so welcome.Thank you Curry Culture for the delicious meal, if I am back in Singapore I will be visiting you again for sure

Whenever I craved for authentic Indian food in Singapore , I always went and ate at curry culture. Dal makhani , Chicken curry & Biryani & Garlic naan are must eats. The staff there are also very nice & friendly

Husband and I had one of the best Indian meals we've ever tasted at Curry Culture. An absolute feast for the taste buds and an education into the bargain. We dined outside and were waited on by very attentive staff who took the trouble to find out your experience of Indian food and your preferences, then make recommendations to suit your palate. This exchange of knowledge was what made the experience so much richer - take the time to hear about the preparation and learn some detail of the area where your selected dish comes from.Papdi Chaat was a delicious new experience for us and highly recommended. Our patient and knowledgeable waiter Prashant guided us through appetisers, starters, mains and accompaniments and even made sure we did not over-order along the way so that we would have room for dessert. We couldn't decide between the speciality house favourite of rice pudding, gulab jaman or kulfi, so Prashant made sure we had all three! It was divine!! This was the best meal during a three week trip to Malaysia and Singapore - a curry lovers dream.The whole experience was so good we would arrange flights with a stop-over in Singapore just to return to The Curry Culture.Worth noting is the advice that they will deliver to your hotel or apartment

My husband and I were desiring Indian food for our first night in Singapore. The concierge at our hotel recommended Curry Culture because of our desire for authentic Indian food and we wanted a casual setting. Situated on Orchard Road, we easily found Curry Culture. We were greeted by a friendly host who offered to seat us. We chose an inside table, because it was somewhat humor and warm outside ... But there are many outside tables also). Within a couple minutes we were served a trio of sauces with some flat bread, to whet our appetites and give us an idea of the flavor to expect. Our waiter, Jimmy Mathew, could not have been more welcoming. He asked if we had been there before, and when he got a feeling for what tastes we were wanting, he had so many great suggestions. We ordered, as per Jimmy's suggestions, after much deliberation, since really there are more selections than what you can decide on! Before our meal came, Jimmy brought us an appetizer that he thought we would love. WOW, the combination of tastes and textures was unbelievable. I don't remember what it was called, but it was truly amazing. ... What I liked was we had just enough time to enjoy our appetizers and drinks when they brought our meal out. Served in authentic little copper pots, the meal just sealed our reasons for writing this review! Truly delicious. Just the right amount of spice, and so flavorful. ... I have to say the staff, and especially Jimmy, was so friendly and helpful and SO sincere. Okay, all in all, we will think about this dinner and wish we could be back in Singapore soon, to experience again. (And again ... And again

The chicken and the lamb was fabulous. The service excellent. The right place in Singapore to have Indian food. The atmosphere is best in the evening
5
Went for dinner at this place on a Saturday night and the food was amazing. The service was excellent, the waiters were friendly and helped us in choosing the dish. The food arrived quite quickly and we were overall satisfied with this place
4
We chose this restaurant because of the excellent reviews and being close to where we are staying as we have just relocated to Singapore.We were not disappointed, we sat outside where the fans created just enough air movement to make the environment very comfortable.Well back to the food, we really enjoyed our meal, the Lamb Vindaloo was excellent and they offer spice level of 1 - 10 as stated on the menu, before the waiter come back we had decided on 5, but after some advise and discussion we decided on 3 and this was perfect, just enough heat to know it was there and it continued to grow but not enough to spoil the dish.The chicken Tikka was nice and juicy, really delicious!The Basmati Rice, Naan Bread and the Raita were excellent!We will be back!Our only recommendation to the owners is that their toilets need a good clean and need better maintenance and a few dollars for a refurbishment. Most diners rate a restaurant on the cleanliness of the restrooms and this restaurant failed, please review and get on top of this!

I went to this place after coming across the review on Tripadvisor.Well, the food was just average, the cocktails quite quirky and the service quite excellent.The food wasn't bad or anything...It was just the average Indian food which you can get anywhere in Singapore
3
Although the owner was really personable & attentive this was an average meal. Having seen the vast array of different vegetables in Little India I was disappointed to have such a basic selection in my vegetarian meal. Although an otherwise identical order, my husband & I chose different main courses & were both quite ill a few hours later & having had nothing to eat or drink prior that day could only attribute it to this meal so it turned out to be a disappointment all round.

Best palak paneer i had in Singapore. Staff is friendly, food is fresh and flavour is authentic. Place is nice

@TheKuoKnowsCurry Culture could quite easily become my new go-to place for good North Indian food in Singapore.North Indian cuisine tends to be less prevalent in Singapore than the more fiery offerings served at the many South Indian establishments that pepper Little India.But tucked away on Emerald Hill is a haven of delicate North Indian flavours and spices. Who needs to scale the heights of the Scoville register, when the chefs at Curry Culture can make simple Indian food taste so good?The Tandoori mixed platter is one of my favourites. It offers a delightful selection of oven grilled poultry, fish and meat. When accompanied with a simple vegetarian curry and some Indian breads, it is more than anyone could ask for.The proprietor, Sandeep, is always ready to offer a helping hand. You can tell he takes great pride in his food, takes a personal interest the presentation, and most importantly, takes good care of his customers
5
Cottage cheese wrap is really nice, very delicious quality food, loved it!Very friendly staff and manager
5
Came here after reading TA reviews, very pleased to see it matched up to the TA comments. Manager Sandeep was excellent and really took the time to understand what we would like - as well as build rapport.Food was EXCELLENT, the shashlik naan was a real triumph. More a very thin pizza than the fluffy stuffed naan we are accustomed to in England!Location is good too, Cuppage Terrace is a lively dining area with central seating that serves many restaurants, with each restaurant having its own dedicated area.Throughly recommended, a great find that made our last night on holiday very special. All too often TRULY good service is found to be lacking in Singapore, and this place delivers it in spades
5
Was searching for a restaurant close to my hotel and during my search on TripAdvisor saw that this eatery featured prominently. Having arrives in Singapore in tiger early morning and being tired and not bothered to travel too far, I made the decision to head to this restaurant based on the reviews. This doesn't need to be a long review - many have said this before: the food was +1, the service +1 and the value was there without question. The free starter consisted of three dipping sauces and papadams - my absolute favourites of these were the tamarind (sauce the slightly, but perfectly sweet, and the chilli/peanut satay-like sauce. But all were great. Rather than have a single main course I was offered half servings (not on the menu) by Sandeep because I was too indecisive. (Always a risk when I'm at an Indian restaurant.) This meant I had have servings of fish, with eggplant and prawn (shrimp) curries, accompanied by saffron rice. I can't find fault with the food, or the service. What can I say: very highly recommended indeed
5
My American colleague and I decided to try best Indian restaurant nearby Orchard , and thanks to trip advisor we found this.I must say it was best find, I was veg and my colleague was not. But we found some great food ..pakodas, prawns, butter chicken, palak paneer ...The ambience was terrific, we chose to stay outdoors. It was bustling The service was toooo good, the people serving giving good explanation of the food...Its a memorable dinner experience to have great business conversation as well enjoy best food
5
The restaurant is located at Cuppage Terrace, just behind Holiday Inn where we were staying. We chose to sit inside as the weather was a bit hot and it felt sweaty outside.Ordered chicken tikka and paneer tikka for starters. The chicken was succulent and tender. The paneer tikka was on a spicier side though.For the main course ordered mutton rogan josh, palak paneer and naans. The mutton was specially flavorful and aromatic. In the end ordered a platter of assorted Indian desserts.Thoroughly enjoyed our outing and very satisfied
4
Being curry lovers, we felt we had to visit this curry house during our 3 night stay in Singapore and also because of its very high rating on TA.From the outside the restaurant is nothing special with lots of outside seating, we opted to sit indoors as we had not yet acclimatised to the heat, the place wasn't busy and we where soon attended to. The staff where very friendly and attentive and we soon had our starters and drinks they where ok and was waiting in anticipation for our mains. I ordered something I would recognise off the menu so I could compare it with others I have had, it arrived and was duly devoured. I must say it was very tasty but a little drier than what I am accustomed to, but was a little disappointed as it was only just comparable to what I have in the UK and I felt the restaurant didn't warrant such a high rating. Having said that it was an enjoyable experience, but if I return I will try a place in little India to compare

Curry Culture is set very nicely at Cuppage Terrace on Orchard Road. Being located in the shopping belt was a boon for vegetarians like us, who prefer Indian vegetarian food. We stumbled upon it by chance after shopping at the Centrepoint and have had no regrets.My last visit was in December 2015 - us a family of three and a mate from the USA. The food there is really good and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they actually had samosa chaat, which was brilliant. The ambience is very nice and if you feel hot in the humid climate that is Singapore, you can always pop in to the air-conditioned comforts of the restaurant. But sitting outside is a nice experience as the restaurants and bars are set in a continuous array of sorts. It lends itself to a festive atmosphere on the weekends.They do have many different kinds of drinks and I was able to get whatever we wanted - from wine to rum and vodka across different brands.What I loved: The food and the service. Everything was brilliant and there's really no cons about either factor. The service was prompt and the folks are very friendly.Word of caution: Tends to get loud on weekend evenings and some corners have people getting their hit of nicotine. So just be wary when visiting with young children. But I had no problems with my 5 year old son sitting closer to the walkway. Highly recommend this place if you're around Orchard. If not Curry Culture, you would love Cuppage Terrace and the multiple dining options it offers
5
I called here for dinner during my two night stopover in Singapore, as a result of seeing it on tripadvisor.Coming from Bradford in the UK, I enjoy good Indian cuisine, and having dined here, I was not disappointed.The welcome was very friendly, and I ate the Chicken Dopiaza with Basmati rice, and it was as nice and tasty as any I have had throughout my travels. With that I also had a beer (Singha, I think, but it was an Asian brewery beer, if not).When I received the bill, I was very pleasantly surprised at the cost.One to be recommended 
5
Went here twice in my five day stay in Singapore, all I can say is fantastic food with an incredible staff. I have eaten Indian food in so many different cities and this one surely stands out. The dish that I could not get enough of is the Chicken Tikka comes out like a sizzling fajita but only more delightful. The Harepyaaz ka Aloo Jeera was also to die for as the spices came alive. Would definetly reccommend to anyone who wants to get some fantastic Indian food in Singapore
5
Enjoyed another excellent night in Curry Culture... Very good food, good setting, cold beer. The Lamb Boona was the best we've had for a long time... We will be back..
5
.It was a good decision to return to this outlet.Today, I decided to walk straight into this restaurant without waiting to be seated ( so I avoid needing to criticize being stood waiting .. haha )A friendly staff promptly established I had dined in before. I recapped the dishes I liked .. the wonderfully delicious Tandoori Platter, the Saffron rice .. and the previous let downs which I will omit this time.I tried a drink new to me, the Mango Maya. It was out of this world ! Forty times more refreshing than the Mango Lassi with more kick than Lionel Messi. Beautiful !Of course, I ordered the Tandoori Platter again. This was why I walked the whole way here. I remembered EXACTLY how great it was last time. This time, it was ... just as GREAT! The Tandoori platter is nicely done, the Tandoori fish remains the highlight for me, I remain AMAZED by how succulent the pieces of fish are on the hot plate. OUTSTANDING !!!I added a dish today, the Chicken Korma. WOW ! Simply the BEST Korma I have ever, EVER eaten. The fragrant sauce is spot on !The Saffron Rice is perfection (just as it was before).This is a heavy meal for one person ... I am not complaining.I am happy I came back.This place is a rather long walk for me, but if the food remains consistently THIS GOOD, I will return regularly.(Maybe Management can reward me with a Mango Maya) haha.

After reading the generally positive reviews of this establishment on TripAdvisor it was all the more disappointing to report what an unremarkable restaurant this is. Yes the service was courteous ,friendly and efficient but the food..and we do eat regularly at different styles of Indian restaurantsl....was downright pretty ordinary and oh SO expensive! 2 standard mains, a galic naan,and 2 lassi drinks...$95!!! Worth mentioning that it sits right in the middle of a very noisy street of restaurants,just off Orchard,which for us actually kills the atmosphere/ambience of the area
5
The food was lovely. The staff where so friendly and welcoming. Great dining experience. I'd recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore :-)
3
We dropped by on Cuppage Terrace for some basic Indian food.Tried their veg kaathi roll: This was average to ok.Then went to order Dal Makhni: This was once again average.Overall, its the ambience of Cuppage Terrace that you pay for.This place on Fridays-Sundays is a very interesting place to be because of multiple restaurants serving food and drinks in a terrace format.I would go back to Cuppage Terrace for its ambience and drinks.If you want indian food at Cuppage Terrace, then yes, its the only option
4
I went to the restaurant because of the reviews from TripAdvisor. The restaurant is easily accessible by metro. We ordered several starters (samosa, garlic bread wtc with a butter chicken as a curry) all being very very good. For main dishes I took chicken byrjani and also tasted chicken tikka. Chicken tikka was very good but the byrjani was average. Overall very good food and I recommend it.
5
My partner and I came here on our first night in Singapore.The staff here were absolutely terrific from the minute we arrived. We were provided good advice on places to eat in Singapore, and for our next leg in India.The food was delicious which commenced with complementary poppadums with sauces.We got the pleasure of trying papdi chaat for the first time which I would highly recommend.Our mains came out very quickly and consisted of two curries, rice and garlic naan bread which was enough for two people. The meat was tender and the sauces where flavoursome and authentic. Great start to the holiday

My wife and I have been to The Curry Culture several time with our dogs, family and friends. The service is fantastic, at tentative, friendly and professional. They do make mistakes, however, when we point out our concerns they have always quickly addressed our situation. The food has always came out fresh and hot, even when we have had large groups. The Margareta's were fantastic when we initially started coming to the restaurant, however we suggested that they add Cointreau to the recipe, which they did at no extra cost or complaints and have served our Margareta's this way since and at a price considered very reasonable in Singapore. The starters are of a reasonable size, which will not distract you from your main meal. We usually have the tandoori mushrooms or the fried mushrooms. One portion of each can be easily shared between three or four people. The Butter Chicken, my wife's favourite, is aromatic, flavoursome and pleasing to the taste buds, the chicken is fresh, tender and light. There are several lamb dishes all are delightful, with generous portions of tender lamb which literally melt in your mouth. They also have seafood dishes which we have not tried. My daughter always orders the kids Afghani Chicken with cheese naan bread which is quite delicious, cooked in a light non-hot spicy yogurt sauce. One of the traits that has endeared me to the staff is that they will make knowledgable suggestions about which dishes to order. Once when we had not eaten all day and started to give our orders to the staff, the actually politely suggested we were ordering to much food, thankfully we heeded their advise as the reduced order was quite a battle to finish without exploding! There was also an instance where we confused one of the dishes and ordered the wrong menu item, when we realised and ordered to correct item the gave us the wrong item for free, probably great marketing as we now order it every time we eat at the restaurant. The first time we went to The Curry Culture was because we walk our two 13 year old dogs down to Cuppage Terrace most nights however on this particular night the restaurant we usually went to said they were too busy to allow the dogs to sit by our table in their outside area, which was fully understandable. However when we walked past The Curry Culture, a few doors up as we were going home, the manager came out and made a compliment about the dogs. We asked him could we bring the dogs into their outside area away from the other guests, but totally understood if he was unable to accept our request. To our surprise he said not a problem and even offered to bring us water. A great restaurant, fantastic atmosphere, delicious food and friendly honest service, what more could you ask for. I would throughly recommend this restaurant.

Are very relaxed and unpretentious place. Still, the curries are excellent and the staff is very friendly. The Rogan Josh was extremely tender and prices are almost cheap given the high quality of food.
4
Pros:
Quality of food is commendable - tasty and not oily.
Service is prompt and respectful.
Delightful ambience - cheerful but not noisy.
Cons:
Slightly on the expensive side.

The restarant is ok, good atmosfere, possibility to eat inside or outside.The waiters and the service are also good.We eat a really good entries offer by the.house, cheese and garlic naan, but really good, a spinach vegetarian dish ..but the garlic in this case cover to much the other flavours.I advice also to try lamb meet.A bit expensive maybe

During our stay at Singapore went for a lunch at an Indian restaurant . It was late afternoon and the whole family settled down for lunch we ordered anything n evetyhing with good menu offering . The food was excellent n wholesome both vegetarian n non vegetarian . Very well prepared Indian food like one would get in a good restaurant in india. Throughly enjoyed the lunch, over ate.

In 2014 we stumbled across Curry Culture, and were introduced to Papdi Chaat. It was amazing, after having it as a starter by son chose to have it as his main. By chance we were in Singapore this week as a stop over, we made our way back there. We got there about 4, only to find they did not open until 5;30 and our jet lag was not going to let us make that. One of the staff came out and we told him our story, he said, "I can go to the kitchen and make that for you, I know how to make it I love it" We were then given a seat, able to order a drink, the owner came over and spoke to us, we felt very special. The Papdi Chaat when it came was just as we remembered wonderful. This is a wonderful restaurant, that care about their customers and staff. The experience was one of the highlights of our time in Singapore. Really a mus

Had this for business lunch and the taste was just simply great! Very on time delivery and gave us free tongs as well for the food. I really enjoyed i

The restaurant was only 5 minutes away from our hotel so great for us to try. The staff are welcoming made sure we had everything we wanted. The food tasted amazing we ordered 3 dishes to share and was very happy. I love Indian food and was happy to find this great place. When next in the area we will pop back. Thanks guys for a great meal
5
We visited The Curry Culture in April 2014 and loved the food and hospitality provided by host Sandeep. We visited again just prior to Christmas for my 60th birthday and it was every bit as good as our first visit. I decided to step out of my food comfort zone (ie meat dishes) and order the Hyderabadi Baingan, a dish made from eggplant, coconut and peanuts. It was sensational. And to conclude the meal Sandeep surprised us with cake and champagne to celebrate my birthday. We'll definitely be back

The iwner is very friendly and a chef himself but does not cook anymoreFood was very authentic and served well after a nice bonapetite papdi piece and papadumswith saucesVery near centrepoint on orchard roadAmbience us goodWent from tripadvisir reviewsIs not for day to day eat outOnly for special occasionsBut lived the experienc

This restaurant was close to our hotel and thus we wanted to try it. The manager was welcoming and very friendly. Food quality was good and the deserts were awesome. It is relatively expensive though, we ended up spending 100 dollars for a single meal for a family of 3
5
The man who served us was very passionate about Indian food we were treated to tasting items we hadn't ordered, what we did order was delicious also service from all staff was very good. Only slight complaint would breads were a little bit too dry / crispy in places, We WILL go bac

We had dinner with 4, only 1 thought the meal was good. This is one of only a few times when trip advisor reviews have been off. I don't think previous reviewers have tried other Singapore Indian restaurants, this one doesn't belong in the upper 50%, and is our least favorite Indian restaurant tried thus far in Singapore. Portions are small, lots of sauce, small bits of meat. The meat portions often have a significant portion of fat attached, which caused 2 of our diners to spit their "meat" out. The rice was good, and the lamb very good. Chicken was well below average. Service was excellent. Parking can be a big pain as the Holland lots fill up fast. I think the only reason it is rated so high in Trip Advisor is it's very touristy location. Not headed back there again, very overpriced for what you get
4
Really good food. Authentic flavours and tailored the spices to our pallette. Very friendly host and good atmosphere
5
We thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience at the Curry Culture. The food was flavorful, the variety of dishes was excellent and the service was spot on. The staff is well trained by the owner, who made sure we were welcomed and taken care of. We will definitely return.
4
Food Quality is awesome, Clean and hygienic sitting, you will find pure dilliwala taste in the restaurant ,best indian food in my whole trip. I would have given 4.5 stars to it half a star is because the price is bit higher side as compared to the restaurants in Singapore but worth a visit if you are visiting the orchard road in singapore. They serve indian sweets like kheer as it was ordered and taste well
4
Nice curries with good quality food and a wide variety of available dishes. Food tends towards less spicy and caters more towards a tourist atmosphere. For food alone I still prefer Little India, but the atmosphere of Cuppage Terrace, particularly on weekend nights is great and adds to the overall experience
5
We have been eating at this restaurant since they opened 3 years ago in Cuppage and have never been disappointed. Sandeep and the team always provide great service and provide suggestions whenever we want to try something new or off-menu. Inclusion of home delivery to their service has been a great addition. The butter chicken and lamb chop masala are our staple order plus the bhuna kebab is always worth ordering. Keep up the great work
4
Went for anniversary dinner, reached at 10:40 PM, almost closing time. But, was admitted and served with nice food.Loved the Kathi Roll and Samosas.Defintely , a must try once if you crave for good north Indian food in Singapore
3
I am surprised by the many good reviews for this very ordinary restaurant. To put it straight - there are very few restaurants in Singapore that serve AUTHENTIC Indian food and Curry Culture is NOT one of them. If you are looking for the standard Indian fare that you get around Singapore - yes, this place should not disappoint. The ambience in Cuppage road though is worth a visit, even if this place leaves you disappointed.
5
Had been advised by friends at work in Melbourne that I had to try the Indian in Singapore.Chose this restaurant to catch up with a friend I have know for years and his family as it was close to our hotel.We were quickly seated outside in a vibrant and energetic part of town and given dips and drinks to look over the menu whilst waiting for the others to arrive.The staff were so professional in helping us choose an appropriate amount with my friends 4 children, then when the food arrived and it was totally beyond what we expected, the flavours were to die for.Would definitely be visiting this venue on future visits
4
The food was very fresh here, unlike most of the other Indian restaurants. We found the curries a little unusual, but they put breast meat into my chicken curry especially for me. Lovely manager and staff - very kind and intelligent. A bit more expensive than your average Indian
5
My new favourite Indian restaurant in Singapore. I enjoyed a mushroom starter that I'd never even heard of before, followed by saag gosht that was superb, and a perfect naan. Service was good, and price was reasonable
4
Good food!Good ambience!Slightly expensive!Location is convenient and it is a must visit place in Cuppage
5
Great atmosphere and great manager. Food was amazing. We got "level 3" hot and was incredibly hot. Would definitely visit agai
5
Sandeep and Jimmy will really look after you here, the best curry in town and as hot as you like to have it
4
On this my third visit over the past year and a half I can confirm the food consistently does something to surprise and elevate what India food is to me. I'm not an expert but know enough.. the bind also Curry yes was spicy as it should be but bursting with flavor and personality. Everything was excellent. And always has been
5
Lovely indian food that is well cooked. Services was good and the staff were helpful in recommending dishes and portions for our group of eight. The outdoor dinning area in front of the restaurant is the place you want to get a seat if possible as it is nice and airy which makes for lovely dining in the evening. If anything the toilets could do with sprucing up and be prepared to pay as the place is not cheap (+SG$50 per person)
5
The food was more than great. The service, value, location, everything about that restaurant is excellent. The food was REALLY great and I am really looking forward to visiting to restaurant again. The staff was constantly smiling and were really great. If you want a nice taste of India, the Curry Culture is a great getaway for you. I would definitely recommend this place to everybody!
5
We found this place on tripadvisor. We had butter chicken, prawns stuffed with crab which was just awesome good. Finished with s few cocktails, not cheap but an excellent meal
5
One of the the best Indian restaurants I have been to. Nice starters and the Lamb ribs were great. Attentive and polite staff.Would recommend
4
Food was good ... nice place ... first time visitor here ... will recommend it to my friends .... Service was excellent ... i hope you keep it up ... On next visit to Singapore a must visit for indian food ...
5
We were told to visit the curry culture on our trip to Singapore by friends and we are VERY GLAD we did! On this trip we visited the Curry Culture for dinner, and then again for lunch a couple of days later - the staff are absolutely beautiful and VERY friendly.The food was fantastic and most definitely the best indian we have ever had! When we return to Singapore, we will definitely be back
5
We family of 4 adult 2 children and 2 infants are on vacation at Singapore. We had dinner on 21st October, 2015 at Curry Culture. Food was as good as "ghar ka khaana" away Frome home. Lamb ribs and Hydrabadi- baingen were superb.Service was prompt. It was pleasure to see owner Mr. Sandeep overseeing service and looking after all guests. Nice man to meet.Satish jhan

Great service.. Awesome starters. Spend your time always with an empty stomach to have the special delicacies..Good ambiance and awesome food and also excellent service and super polite staff. i loved that
1
My husband ate here two nights ago. Since then, he's been ill with diarrhea and nausea. How can they serve such bad food that makes you ill?
5
Only two nights in Singapore at the end of a long trip. Two of the party felt like curry and independently ended up choosing the same place (from Trip Advisor). Great service, amazing food, and cheap (by comparison in Singapore) cocktail jugs which were also amazing. Friendly and helpful staff. And if you're not sure what you like, ask for a recommendation, they suggest well! All super tasty and large servings (two of us shared a curry and extra bread, plenty!). Had the Tikka Masala which is my 'usual' curry and while not very similar at all, it was awesome on it's own accord! Would definitely recommend
4
Love this restaurant and love the food. The owner is great and always very welcoming. Portions sizes are generous. Nice atmosphere in the evening.
5
The food was excellent, portion size just right, however the service was above expectations. We were given Indian street food to try at the start of our meal and helped to choose mains of the right heat and flavour. During our meal a member of the team chatted to us about life in both Mumbai and Singapore giving us a residents/immigrants view of the city. On finding out the trip was for my husbands birthday we then served dessert, complete with candle, and a glass of bubbly each. Thanks to all for a great evening ou

Tried a couple of Indian dishes and they were good. Quite authentic, perfectly spicy and decent portion. I'd say just a bit pricey. If there was an option of 3.5, I'd use tha
5
The food was great and the staff is very friendly. Very recommended to all that likes indian food. By the way this is my first review in trip-advisor
4
Good food, very subtly flavoured. Nothing overpowers the other. Rather all the flavours collaborated to highlight the best. The Chef surely takes pride in what goes out of the kitchen and the service staff is friendly. It shows in the overall result. I know what fine Indian food is all about and this one is as good as you can get away from India
4
Informal and well run, this restaurant serves great food. Staff on the ball and very efficient. We had a great meal here and can thoroughly recommend the curry culture!

Incredible customer service as soon as we arrived. The food was amazing aswell and a great atmosphere all round. We were very happy to have visited the curry culture!

I visited the other Curry Culture, at Robertson Quay. I went on a quiet Saturday night and stumbled across the restaurant after going one too many bridges down the Singapore River looking for another resturant!The staff were friendly and attentive, though the manager asked one tome too many times if I wanted a drink (I had water in front of me). I ordered a simple meal of Aloo Gobi and Chicken Tikka.Papads came out to nibble on with chutneys, and they were good. The Tikka was sizzling on the hot plate when it came out, with a bed of onions and cabbage. The flavour was good, the tikka seasoning was working (just a little spice to it), but the majority of the cuts of my chicken were darker meat - which is fine if you like dark meat, but I prefer whiter for tikka. The Aloo Gobi was good, with a nice mix of potato and cauliflower, well seasoned.I left feeling that the fare was just a little high in price for the quality of the meat I personally received, perhaps on a different night it would be different. I've had better Indian food in Singapore (Little India)
5
Experienced a wonderful night of indian cuisine. The wait staff were very talkative, intriguing and helpful in choice of meals. Reasonably priced and overall a great night!

I was truly looking forward to dinner at Curry Culture since I saw a menu that incorporated many regional items making in more interesting than the regular Northern Indian fare restaurants. Unfortunately I found that all dishes were quite underflavored or underseasoned. I understand that the restaurant is in a very commercial setting but would have hoped for flavors that were much more developped, much more complex, much more true to form. Even the raitas and the chutneys seemed to have been rushed... Almost as if the kitchen that night was being taken care of by a new cook just getting to know the standards.Service-wise, it was very friendly and well above average though I also thought we could've been advised more promptly about the food being so late. There were 2 other tables I believe and dishes truly took a long time to come out
5
I visit here often and the curry's are top class. I'm not regular enough to be recognized but that doesn't seem to matter the staff are really on the ball and I'm always looked after. The space is really well set out and works for entertaining and leisure. Highly recommended.
5
We come here often as it's easily consistently the best curry, service and ambience for a venue of its kind. Can't recommend enough. Excited to see they have expanded to a second venue too (also superb)!
5
We came here with friends for a birthday dinner, and the hosts really made it special and memorable for us. Every dish is well-made and delicious, but don't miss the flambe chicken tikka. We love that you can customize the level of spiciness for the dishes. The ambiance is great as well. The restaurant is located on a back/pedestrian street that is filled with other restaurants and shops, and there is plenty of outdoor seating with ceiling fans for cooling (Singapore can be quite humid). At the end of the meal, the hosts gifted us a chocolate brownie cake for the birthday celebration. Thank you for the hospitality and generosity
4
The food are great, you can trust the staff for food recommendations but you need to know your intake limit. If you are a small eater, 1 starter, 2 main course are good enough for you.
5
If you want Pakistani or indian food, this is the best place. Walking distance from our hotel at orchard road. Although expensive but we couldn't resist after eating pardah biryani, and visited twice. U won't find this taste in little indi
4
Located just off Orchard Road next to a selection of other restaurants. Friendly staff and a good old "British" curry just like we have back home! Onion Bhajis and Chicken Jalfrezi recommended. Children's menu.
5
I have eaten here many time times now in the last six months and the food has always been filled with flavours and packs a punch! Staff very easy to chat with and good at gauging your taste and make good suggestion. Recommend highly for authentic Indian in the heart of orchard road.
5
Went on a recent Friday night and it was great. Would recommend booking as it was quite busy. Great range of Indian dishes and the service was excellent, friendly and efficient. The atmosphere in the food court area was vibrant and lots of local office workers were enjoying the end of the working week
5
The Curry Culture is located at the heart of Orchard Road within 5 minutes walk from Sommerset MRT station, just right behind the Centrepoint shopping center. Upon reaching the place, I was greeted warmly by Mr. Jimmy Mathew - the restaurant manager. He took the patience to explain the different kind of foods they have and gave me his personal recommendation. I ordered "Papdi Chaat" as stater, and "Aloo Gobhi" & "Murgh Tikka Masala" as the main meal. The food taste extremely well and am glad ordering it. I was highly recommended by a close colleague to try out this restaurant when in Singapore and since then never regretted it. Highly recommended to those who liked authentic Indian food
5
This restuarant is located in food court, there are two Indian restuarants and we picked the first which was The Curry Culture. The service is excellent and the food is great, we ordered Chicken 65 which was not on the menu and they specially prepared it for us and it was very great. Try the Vindaloo and if you want it spicy and hot go for number 5. We had plain rice, beef vindaloo, chicken 65 and a vegetable dish
5
Best service I've had in a restaurant for a long time. The waiter recommended dishes to us and even gave us one to try on the house
5
I ate at The Curry Culture on Cuppage Terrace. The food was great, the service was excellent, loved the atmosphere. I ate outside, very busy and bustling, lots of activity. I found this to be much better than just sitting in a restaurant, or at least tonight I did
5
Second time visiting this delicious restaurant. Friendly staff, very good with kids, and great food. Good location right off Orchard road.
5
We chose this restaurant as we were in Cuppage Terrace, adjacent to the Holiday Inn. The staff were immediately welcoming to my sons and I, all of whom enjoy an Indian and have been fortunate to dine at some exceptional restaurants in India, the UK and across Asia.We ordered the tandoori platter, tarka dhal, chicken jalfrezi and roti. Without exception, each dish was exquisite. The platter was bursting with incredible fish, kebabs, chicken and lamb. The Jalfrezi was a perfect balance of flavours and spice, while the dhal brought everything together with the warm roti. The bill showed incredible value - I've paid a lot more for a lot less quality.The real memory for my sons will be the staff; not only were they fun, but the following day my son went to say hello en route back to the airport. They invited him into the kitchens to see the food being prepared and cooked, taking photos and making him feel part of what is clearly a fantastic team. I'd recommmend the restaurant to everyone, and will ensure I return with my family at the earliest opportunity
5
we opted for the tandoori set for dinner and it did not disappoint us, we added buttered chicken and some papadum(which is our favorite) to our menu and voila! fireworks all over our mouth heheh, btw, they have great staff, i commend them for being very accomodating. kudos to you all!
5
We were looking for somewhere to have dinner and found Cuppage alley. We decided to stop at The Curry Culture and so very pleased we did. The food was very flavoursome and the staff very attentive.
We would definitely return
4
Lovely staff, nice location outside shophouses between Emerald Hill and Orchard. Food was good and the staffs advice on food combinations was knowledgable and worth taking. Will definitely return
5
We were looking for a good curry and were initially planning on going to another restaurant, however after looking at Trip Advisor we saw this place getting great reviews. We are so pleased we changed and went here instead. The service was great with the waiter making some recommendations on what we should try and how spicy. We enjoyed the food so much we went the following night too. Definitely worth a visit
5
The restaurant is right by the Holiday Inn where I was staying which made it easy to access. It's also in amongst all the other Cuppage restaurants but this was an easy choice.Friendly and helpful service and delicious food, nice cold beer and a chilled atmosphere make it a perfect destination for an evening meal
5
A very pleasant surprise. We ere scouting for a place to eat, when we were greeted by Mr. Sandeep Sachar, the owner of this restaurant. We were taken in by his warmth, and although we had no intention of having Indian food, we ended up having our dinner there.Another day, we got late for dinner, and landed at Cuppage. The other restaurants refused us, but Mr. Sachar was kind enough to seat us.Do go by his recommendations, as some Indian dishes were better than those we have had in India
5
Wow! What great experience at Curry Culture! For each plate you have to choose your spicy level from 1-10. For my European standards I couldn’t take the level 6 of spice. Nevertheless, we had an excellent introduction to the menu and hot levels from the restaurant manager. As soon he found out that we were not able to handle the hotness he immediately brought the fire extinguisher – mango lassi – and offered to bring a new plate less hot. The meat was really smooth and tasty. Fantastic! Definitely will return on a next visit to Singapore
4
We went to Curry Culture on the strength of its trip advisor rating and reviews. It's great to report that we found everything as previously reported! The staff make the difference at restaurants and the staff here are up there with best.On arrival as I said the staff were very polite and helpful. We went for the vegetable samosas and onion bhajis for starters....be warned they are large portions - they both tasted excellent. For the main course we went for a vegetable curry and a chicken jalfrezi - they were both very tasty and could not be faulted. During all this our daughter had ordered the children's curry which came with a good amount of rice and vegetables which she enjoyed. It's also worth mentioning that the surrounding area of other restaurants/bars make this a good place to eat with a very good atmosphere. All in all a great night out - We will return to Curry Culture when we next visit Singapore
5
Great food and fun. Enjoyed the outside area and the staff was great. Some very delicious Indian food! Recommend this place for anyone visiting Singapore.
5
Firstly the manager Jimmy provides incredible customer service, he is engaging and extremely focused on your dining experience. Similarly his staff are all very friendly and hard working. The food is fantastic from the wonderful sample dish, fresh poppadums to any other menu items. We have visited here several times over the last three years and have always been made to feel very welcome. Recommended without reservation for superb food and personalised service
1
Service was very poor. Slow took over one hour to get served. Orders for bread and poerdoms were not delivered. Took over 20 mins to even pay the bill. Portions were very poor, so small. The curry eas like baby food it was so sweet with little flavour. This is one to miss. Very expensive what it is
5
I loved there food. We had Dal makhni naan... amazing I am veggi person...
Personally loved there food.
And its in center off crowded restoo which having happening croud... Must go...
5
The restaurant has indoor and outdoor sections in the bustling Cuppage area of Singapore.
Tables are neatly laid out.Staff is very friendly.
Food was delicious and service was prompt.
5
Cuppage Terrace is a cool location offering loads of restaurants / bars and atmosphere. Curry Culture offered great food and service, well worth a visit.. Put it on your list!
4
Very well designed venue. Perfect place to impress colleagues from work or visitors. Food was overall tasty and priced on upper end but you get quality experience. Normally. I had a sour debate with server on food spice rating from 1-10 which ended with me eating food spiced at 3 (as per my persistent server) and I was dying with every bite. My advice. Just eat mild and dont ask for spicy. Cos 3 was unbearable imagine 4 or 5 out of 10. Logic does not apply to spiciness here and this was first time in 4 visits I had this problem. Lesson learned. No more requesting spicy food else I have to face that persistent server once again. Baring this disappointing experience, the owners and managers run the establishment very well with many happy customers as seen at my last visit.
5
We have just returned from an amazing dinner at The Curry Culture. Wonderful food, well thought out meal, excellent complimentary amuse bouche pre curry and mango lassi post curry. Wonderfully friendly service and great ambience. Would definitely return!!
5
I am going to be brief since I don't like writing long reviews. This is the best Indian food I have found in Singapore. The service is absolutely phenomenal. The staff is super friendly and that part is very refreshing in Singapore. The food is outstanding
5
Whilst staying in Singapore, we looked around for a good restaurant to get a curry, and Curry Culture appeared with good reviews. The reviews were right, this was a really good place to go!Located about 10 minutes in a taxi from the CBD, it's pretty easy to get to. The restaurant is amongst other restaurants undercover in Cuppage Terrace, and has a good atmosphere with all the people sitting in the middle of everything. We didn't have to book when we arrived about 8:30pm and there were a few tables free.We ordered from the menu and were also advised by the people serving as to what else may be a good choice and anything else we may like with it. The curry and extras we chose we exceptionally good with taste, spice, heat, and amount of food. Thoroughly enjoyed the food and relaxing for a bit before heading off. The prices were reasonable, and what I expected to pay. Highly recommended, helpful and efficient staff, and excellent food

Sometimes, I do not understand what authentic Indian food means. Many reviewers mention that come here for authentic Indian food but my good friends what do you mean authentic. Food is food, there is no authenticity etc involved. It cannot be that a restaurant serves you Italian cuisine on the name of Indian cuisine. Anyway, if you pass through Cuppage road, you find this restaurant among many others thriving at this small stretch. The location and ambiance is premium so dining here could be an expensive affair. I went for a dinner and ordered vegetarian menu. The food came with little delay but if you are enjoying your drink then you can discount that delay. I feel that serving quantity was little less then expected, if you order a curry dish then it would be sufficient for one person only, for two to share it would ve little hard. As per the price, i expect that a dish could be shared between two but this is not the case.Overall, the environment around will allow to soak into fine dining experience and you can expect every hospitality of the wait staff. They are good and cheerful people.So if you are at Cuppage road, and interested in Indian cuisine, and do not mind price, then try out this outlet
5
Great restaurant serving authentic North Indian food with the buzz of Cuppage terrace in the background. We had a long chat with the owner Sandeep about Indian food - his passion clearly shines through. The food lived up to our expectations and all the dishes Sandeep picked were winners. The rest of the staff were super friendly as well. Overall, worth a visit if you want to savour some authentic down home cooking
4
We visited The Curry Culture today for dinner to try some Indian traditional curry, and our decision was the best!! We had vegetable samosa as starters, while for the main dish we had lamb vindaloo, butter chicken, and boneless chicken tandoori. We had along with the main dishes saffron rice, rumali bread, naan bread, and mixed raita (yogurt with onion, cucumber, and tomatoes, and some spices). The restaurant service is superb, waiters are very attentive. The only downside is that the restaurant is a bit expensive, which i think makes it worth visiting for special occasions.
5
Absolutely superb evening with such a warm and personal touch. The staff are incredible, attentive, knowledgable and really really welcoming. The food is incredible, I suggest you choose by having a conversation with the hosts as they make superb recommendations based on what yo would like to try. We had a couple of items to start and intend to make our way through every item in time! Main course each, one rice and one naan, so much food! The tandoori prawns stuffed with crab were out of this world! Try the mango cocktail too! So refreshing! Excellent value for money and I would have like this restaurant wherever it was but the fact that Cuppage Terrace is such a great spot makes it even better! Will be regulars here from now on
5
Welcomed with a warm smile to alfresco dining this was just the start of a great evening. The menu is simple enough and the staff very helpful and well informed on the choices. The dishes are very tasty indeed and compare very well to similar faire in Delhi itself. If it's Indian food you fancy then I wouldn't go past The Curry Culture. There's also quite an energetic atmosphere in The Cuppage adding to the merriment.
3
.I ate here on a Saturday evening.I was left standing waiting to be seated.Staff NOT ATTENTIVE.I could have easily walked off to the next outlet.Only 30% of seats occupied, so NOT yet busy.Onion Bhagi was DISAPPOINTING.Tasted of FLOUR and nothing else !!Tandoori Platter was BEAUTIFULLY DONEThe fish was outstanding, difficult to get right on a sizzling hotplateThe prawns, chicken, meat ALL nicely seasonedEXCELLENT CHOICE, must order this again !!Saffron rice was fragrant and done wellMango Lassi lacks yoghurtService needs improvingThe restaurant began to fill up and the wait staff seemed pressuredand it was difficult to get any attentio
5
This is undoubtedly one of the best Indian restaurants I have eaten in anywhere - including India. The spice is rich and varied, not simply hot for the sake of being hot, though if you want things at the dynamite end of the spectrum they will do it on request. I prefer to order it "how you would eat it" and it always seems to come out just right. A particular favourite is the keema matar - a curried minced lamb dish that is a rare find on a restaurant menu. Kebabs are also outstanding, though it is best to go as a group and share a platter as individual orders are so large you won't eat your main course. The wine list is extensive for a curry house, and reasonably priced by Singapore standards. I go back to this place every time I am in Singapore and even if it's been a few months I am greeted like a long-lost brother. Highly recommended

Last Thursday after work we were looking for a place to have a few drinks and North Indian dinner off Orchard Road.. As we walked out of the Holiday Inn Park view hotel we discovered this open air eatery in Cuppage terrace!! Mutton, Yellow Dal , Roti and Jeera Rice were all super..Topped up by mouth watering Kulfi..Macallan single malt was available as a preamble to the divine meal!
5
Really enjoyed my meal here. The service was great and fast and the ambiance is great. Located near cup page it's centrally located to holiday inn orchard road. Price is very reasonable
4
Although I would have given a 5 star rating to the taste of food but I did not give because of high prices ....it costs like a five star hotel in delhi ...their food is superb no doubt ,we relished the taste 
5
I chose this restaurant based on its high Trip Advisor standing, and I was thrilled with the quality of the dinner and service we received. I asked the head waiter (manager?) to provide a veg meal of the chef's choosing for my friend and me. He inquired to our hunger level and spice-tolerance meal, and we were delighted with the dishes we were served (in a smaller size, as well, which was unexpected and appreciated as there were only two of us and we were then able to sample more dishes). Bravo on a great meal and equally great service
4
Thanks to Mr. Sachar for the warm hospitality, lovely ambience, good food! Cocktails are good, food made perfectly as per our requirements! Kids wanted to keep coming back to TCC!! Keep up the good work!
4
Of course nobody likes to spend too much on local food these days when there are cheaper hawker version of everything here. However, this is probably one of the best Indian Food served around here. Costly, but worth every penny you spend on.As a local myself, I hate to splurge on local food but this place is an exception. Staffs were friendly and ever-willing to share their views on each item. We tasted their Butter Chicken, Goan Fish Curry, Masala Steak... and man, it was probably one of the best we ever tasted here in Singapore. Prices are a teeny bit steep, but definitely worth spending on. Their mocktails are worth the try too ( I think it was called Pink Lady ) . Definitely a good place to head out for dinner if you are seeking out for finger-licking indian food. Price varies around the average of $50 - $80 per visit for a couple
4
Loved the Indian food served here and loved the fact that the service was with a smile. Our server gave us nice titbits of useful information while we had delicious mouthfull of tasty food. Food quality was comparable with many decent restaurants of Mumba
5
Went there to for dinner. Made a reservation a day before. No issue. The menu is extensive but not overwhelming and the servers are helpful in suggesting good choices. I have had lots of Indian food in my life and often leave places feeling disappointed, not this time
5
This restaurant is worth a visit, we ate their twice in 3 days. The food is great and good value, the owner of the restaurant is a really nice guy. If you like Indian food it is a must visit.
5
We ate at this restaurant last Friday night and it was such a fabulous experience from start to finish. I called and booked our table with Ajay about an hour before we arrived and was greeted by first name when we walked up to the restaurant by a lovely guy (we didn't catch his name but i'm guessing he was the owner). Ajay recommended some dishes for us to try and they were just gorgeous. We asked for hot and we got hot food, although according to Ajay on a scale of 1-10, our food was only a 2!! He was busy topping up our glasses with water all night. At one stage he even brought out a glass of 'fire extinguisher' to cool our throats :) Again though, hot food was what we wanted, and we were really happy with it.When we were finished the owner brought out a complimentary sample of another Indian dish for us to try which was so tasty also.It was definitely one of the best and most fun dining experiences we have ever had.I will be back
4
Nice wee touch with the chef's starter. Tomato soup lovely. Saffron rice tasty and the chicken Jalfrezi sauce and vegetables were great. The only slight let-down was that bits of the chicken were overdone and a wee bit tough. Staff excellent - very friendly and attentive and I would recommend it
5
Stopped in on a quick trip through SG, looking for top notch Indian food, and I wasn't disappointed. The staff was friendly and helpful, bringing me a super tasty amuse boy he to get started and gently encouraging me to try something besides my standard dish, and I'm so glad they did. Their smoked creamy eggplant curry was spectacular. It was expensive, but Indian food is always expensive, and so considering that it's Singapore - reasonable. Will gladly return again
4
I am surprised that I have not reviewed this place earlier. I am a quasi regular here - all for the intended love of bhuna gost ( a North Indian mutton delicacy ) and the fresh aromatic nun breads. Chicken butter masalah is also worth tryin
5
Okay, so your in Singapore & your looking for a cold beer & a good curry? Then I can't say enough about this place, other than that I've never seen a more diverse menu, containing things I've never seen before? It wasn't until the owner came out for a chat that I understood the passion that he puts into his food, you can taste the love he has for it, in fact I asked "have you got your mum chained to the stove out back?"For Gods sake don't visit Singapore without visiting this place! Sorry to rave on so much , but credit where credits due
4
Was a busy night ( was friday )could not find a place to eat anywhere in that area. So we decided to check this place out and found a place for us. The food was average but the drinks were good. The owner tries very hard to impress and works very hard . My best wishes to hi
4
This restaurant was a little hard to find since there was some renovation going around the outside seating area, but very cute signs guided us to a nice outside seating area. The renovation in no way disturbed our dinner. We visited in early may. The food was very good, basic indian food, which isn't always easy to find. The prices were very reasonable too. The highlight of our dinner was our waiter who really made our day! We will definitely return to this restaurant in our next visit to Singapore
5
Must try Indian Restaurant at Cuppage Plaza. Dined here for the second time, and their Hyderabadi Biriyani and Mango Lassi are signature stuff. Top it with some nice tikkas and kababs.
4
If I had a really nice lunch here the staff were very friendly and helpful and help me choose the correct meal I had the lamb chicken chicken masala and it was beautiful to little bit pricey but then it is Singapore spent 2 1/2 hours there I wasn't disappointe
5
I had a great lunch at this restaurant. The service was excellent, the food was full of flavor and I left as a very satisfied customer! It wasn't cheap but it was worth the price. Located off of Orchard Road in a nice restaurant row area
4
I ordered butter chicken curry because nice Indian stuff recommended me. The curry is totally orange! It is a little bit sower and sweet. Also this taste was the first time I've ever eaten, but I like it! He had confidence with it as well.The Nan bread was also a little sweet.I ordered only one curry, but the stuff gave me one more nice dish. It was starter and one of the most recommended dishes. It tastes very INDIAN FOOD and I love this dish and his service
5
When writing a Trip Advisor review, it is quite easy to be hyperbolic and make what is a fairly average meal sound extremely good.Let me assure you, with this review, this is not the case, you need to believe the Hyperbole. Curry Culture at Cuppage Terrace is amazing.I have lived in Singapore for 3 years and have travelled here for many years prior. I have eaten at high-end 5 Star Indian, at Banana Leaf Restaurants and the tourist traps of Little India. None of them compare to Curry Culture, and I rate it as the best value for money Indian Restaurant in Singapore and as such, I am a regular visitor.The service is fantastic, with the manager and his staff being very attentive. They are happy to alter the spiciness of your meal to suit your palate, though even if you’re a veteran Chilli eater I wouldn’t stray too far past level 7 on your first sitting! They are also happy to adjust the size of your portions depending on how many people you have.I have tried most of the menu, and is all fantastic, a particular favourite are the Chicken Kathi roles are worth a mention, though for the Vegetarians, the Paneer Kathi Roles are an excellent alternative.You can’t really go wrong with any of the mains (Biryani is a good place to start) , with all the standards there, as well as some of the less seen favourites.The setting on Cuppage Terrace is relaxed and enjoyable, and its only a short stroll to Emerald Hll after you meal for an Aperitif.Highly recommend
5
Curry Culture was introduced to us by a friend of ours and over the last two years we have become frequent visitors. The Owner and staff remember their customers from each visit and are always very friendly. The food is North Indian cuisine and we have yet to have a bad dish served, they are also accommodating in 'tweaking' the taste of dishes if required, not too spicy etc. Cuppage is also a very nice area, good atmosphere but not too crowded. There are a few bars around that you can also frequent before and after dinner. I'd thoroughly recommend what has become our 'go to' Indian restaraunt
5
You should not miss this restaurant! The taste and the service is outstanding. The place looks like one of 1000 but the food is definitely unique and special
5
We went last Saturday for a dinner. We were two couples. we had chaas (Nice), Chicken Tikka (yummy), Prawn masala(good), Kadai vegatble, Paapdi chaat (fantastic), Fish curry (boneless) and some NAD whose name i forgot. It is just awesome and we enjoyed the food so much
4
Tasty Northern Indian cuisine in a cozy setting with excellently attentive and knowledgeable service. The chef and waiter were very accommodating to our dietary restrictions (no butter, cream, or white flour), and all the dishes came out full of flavor. Recommend the roti & pandanth, barbecue John Dory fish, and puréed spinach with mushroom & corn. Great adult beverage list too
5
So I have made about 70 contributions to date on Tripadvisor and most times I review Hotels, but some times, when there are exceptions experiences, I will provide a review on a restaurant. The Curry Culture is one of these times that it deserves the top reviews it receives.I had dinner there last Saturday night with friends based on previous tripadvisor reviewers. My expectations were fairly high and I was not disappointed. There are always 2 core requirements that I want from a restaurant. Quality food and good service and The Curry Culture understands these core principles to perfection.I enjoyed it so much, I brought a foodie friend from overseas the other night and again had a great evening meal.Sandeep the owner and Ajay the manager know their food. We trusted them with some of their recommendations and they were excellent. Sandeep actually recommended a bottle of wine to compliment the food and again....very impressive. The request from us was spicy food, but not over spicy that we lose the flavours. The dishes were perfectly prepared with the right amount of spice and some complex flavours that were very complementary. The service was friendly and efficient and the price was great when you consider the quality of food.This has now become my top Indian restaurant in Singapore and is in my top 5 places to eat in Singapore.Give it a go....you will not be disappointe
5
Tucked just behind the Holiday inn Hotel, Orchard City Center, in the food courts. Gets quite crowded and noisy in the evenings. The food here is just awesome. Service is good. Little difficult to locate as it gets lost in the hosts of eateries around. Take an outdoor seating and have a great time
4
I'm really found of India, and without any doubt, of its food. therefore,even when I was visiting my father and Its family (with three young children) in Singapore, I needed to satisfy my always-demanding desire for this South-Estern delight. I elected the Curry Culture for this purpose, and it was worthy. The food was extremely good, I couldn't stop eating (not just because of my greetness though, my whole family was really pleased). The all set of apetizers, main course and drinks felt very authentic and of good quality, the service unremarcable. And everything seemed even better thanks to the joyful bollywoodish atmosfere. A must try! (even for those who are in Singapore just for a short trip).
5
Ate here twice because we enjoyed it so much the first time we went back for more. 2 starters, 2 curries, 2 rice, 2 nann bread, 2 beers & 3 cokes cost approx Â£75 (GBP).
5
If you're looking for a good curry with no fuss, this is a good option. The place is on cuppage Lane, between some (rather loud) bars, but don't be put off by that. Best seats are outside. The food is the star here.... No pretension, no fusion style, just good curries full of flavor and spice. If you do go for the vindaloo... Note that the chefs scale of 1-10 on spice is an Indian scale, not western! I had a 4 last time and I needed about 30 minutes to finish it. If you live near Somerset Mrt they also do take away if you aren't keen on the vocal stylings of the neighboring bar
4
The food was pretty good here. The restaurant is conveniently located right opposite Holiday inn, orchard City centre. Mr Sachar, the owner of the restaurant is a friendly gentleman along with his colleague who ensured that we are comfortable and were very hospitable. It's a great place for all Indian travellers
5
Myself and my husband are here in Singapore on business . We visited this restaurant in Cupage Terrace when it first opened about 3 years ago and thought at the time how fabulous the food tasted and we visit each time we come to Singapore. Our meal this evening tasted as wonderful as ever and we both said it must be one of Singapore's best hidden secrets! We would highly recommend Papdi Chaat as a starter. For the main we had a Malabar fish curry. There is a wonderful atmosphere in Cupage Terrace ...... The restaurant is family owned and the owner has a passion for creating authentic Indian cuisine with a fusion
3
I've been to this restaurant twice which is located very near to somerset MRT. The ambience is chic and service kewl. The food was good first time though but 2nd time it was absolutely bizzare. I mean, the gobi manchurian were falling apart and taste was no good. Neither was the dal makhani or panner curry. On the other hand their biryani is very tasty. Overall, after the meal is done, you'd get a feeling you paid a little too much and that too jus for the location
5
Birthday Treat it was ! Ended up a treat from the chefs of Curry culture. We were 12 of us for a birthday treat. We wanted to explore the indian restaurants in and around Orchard. Curry culture happened to catch our eye and we ended up at the one on Cuppage road. It was overwhelming to look at the heavy queue at the restaurant and we were offered to be transferred to their branch at Robertson Quay by the Owner himself, a sign of great respect i would have to admit.We landed at half past 8 in the evening with our tummies ringing and we were wonderfully welcomed by the receptive restaurant co-owner ( sorry i forgot both their names). The starters ( both veg & non-veg) were mouth watering. The spices were cleverly mixed and the quantity of food sumptuous. The best dish i loved was the dum biriyani which was by far the best I have had in my life. Would definitely turn up again to check on the other dishes

Nicely placed in an Palestrina alley full of other outdoor restaurants. Food was just superb and at reasonable price for generally pricey Singapore

Last minute decision to eat here but what a great choice. Food was some of the best we've tasted and extra choices from "The Boss" were super surprises. Super location, super food, super staff
5
Super food, great service. Super attention.
Good idea of seeds after the meal.
Thank you again.we enjoyed it a lot.

Very nice restaurant, definitely the best Indian food i have had so far in Singapore. Really good service, friendly staff, and absolutely delicious chicken. Recommended!
5
Very good selection of North Indian favourites in a lively night scene. Curries and dahl were amazingly good, as were the naan and saffron rice. So good, and primary reason for visiting Singapore was for good Indian food. No disappointment here. Excellent service and reasonable pricing. Loved the Bollywood movies on the big screen. Thanks to the manager, chef and team

We were in Singapore for 3 days and eat out every night. All meals were of a high standard - but beware, Singapore is an expensive city - most meals will cost you DOUBLE what it does at home - But, hey, you're on holiday, and life's too short etc. etc.This was probably our best meal. The restaurant is in a covered "Plaza", just off Orchard street. A really lively, loud place with a good selection of restaurants. The Curry Culture had a "Trip advisor" Award, which settled our choice of eating!The restaurant manager, Ajay, greeted us and before taking our order enquired about our likes and dislikes and then recommended dishes accordingly. Whilst waiting for meals, Ajay brought us "Typical" Indian appetisers. By the time our main meals came, we couldn't really do them justice! When we had finished, Ajay then brought us small puddings!Great food, great, friendly serviceThank you Ajay and, as promised, our review
5
This was our first experience with Indian food but after the meal we enjoyed it will not be our last. The service was as exeptional as the meal; we confessed to our host that we had never tried Indian and were struggling with our selections. He immediately took over and arranged a wonderful combination of dishes making sure we had the right level of spice and even brought out a few extras for us to try. I can not say enough about the quality of the food and the service; top notch experience overall
5
We had a wonderful meal this evening. The greeting was welcoming and the service attentive. There are so many choices in Singapore, so make sure you visit as you will be pleased you did. Sandeep is a most gracious host checking to make sure we were happy with the taste and heat level. We only had one evening in Singapore and look forward to returning here! Enjoy!!

Looking for a decent restaurant in Singapore is not easy as there are plenty of very average ones. Curry Culturenserves great food in a nice atmosphere with very good staff who can assist in choosing the right dishes to suit you taste.going back soo

Felt like part of the family, we received fantastic service, they cooked a dish for us that we requested and was not on the menu, it was perfect! the owner brought out different items to try too. The whole experience was fantastic. Great value for money, great ambiance, terrific vibe as it is set amongst other restaurants almost open air, but with a roof. Highly recommend it

Food was very good. Good portions. Ambience is also good , Service was fast. The breads - naan/paratha was nice and soft. Overall enjoyed the lunc
5
No complaints here at all, always a tasty meal and staff remember us after just a couple of times. Cuppage is a great place with live music, vibrant atmosphere and great price food, at reasonable prices, just off Orchard Rd
4
My family and I have never been to Cuppage Terrace, in all the years we have visited Singapore. We have tried many Curry Restaurants, and this is up there with one of the best for taste, flavour, friendly and informative service staff.We tried a couple of different curries, patek paneer, naan bread, rice and raita all excellent. My husband loves hot vindaloo so he was suggested to try a number 3 which he did, but he did mention next time he goes back he will try a number 5!!!Look forward to our next visit when in Singer
5
We ate here after reading the Trip Advisor reviews. We were looking for good, casual Indian food and a nice beer and wine list. We found everything we were looking for. Two of our group ordered Vindaloo (one chicken; one prawn.) Both ordered Level 3 on a spiciness scale of 1 to 10. Both were surprised at how spicy the dishes were. (In fairness, the waiter said the chef could tone down the spiciness if it was too much, but neither of our group chose to do that.) I had the Butter Chicken, which was great. I ate Butter Chicken in numerous restaurants in India last year, and this was as good as any dishes I had there. We rounded out the meal with naan bread and rice. As a lovely touch, the waiter brought an hors-d'oeuvre, mango juice, and a rice dessert free of charge. I recommend The Curry Culture
2
If this is a 4.5 star restaurant, heaven help us all! shame on you "raters" for misleading innocent visitors like us. based on reviews, & several prior bad choices here in Singapore, we were so looking forward to this place! But, to sum up: a) chicken tikka -- my wife used to have a tandoori restaurant in Melbourne; her chicken tikka dish was a "10"; we used to have a favorite Indian restaurant in Toronto -- their chicken tikka was a solid 7.5, maybe even an 8 on a good night; curry culture chicken tikka tonight was a 3 at a stretch -- no sizzle, no hot platter, no significant accompaniment; no great texture or flavor; rated as high as 3 only because the two of us did bother to eat ~ 1/2 of it. b) (stuffed) prawn curry -- sorry, but very unappealing presentation, tough over cooked prawns, un- identifiable "stuffing", sauce undeserving of the title "curry".c) onion bhaji appetizer -- not bad.d) (plain) naan -- came out "garlic" instead, & a very strong garlic at that -- not great. e) plates -- not at all heated of course; seems almost a given, sadly

My partner and I enjoyed a delicious lunch at the Curry Culture, following a busy day of exploring and shopping in Singapore. The restaurant is in a great location as it is just off Orchard Road, so ideal for any hungry shoppers. We were seated at once outside and quickly offered menus and water. The staff were very friendly and took time to review the menu with us and make recommendations. We started with the onion bhaji, which were absolutely delicious - the ideal starter to share between two people. For the main course we shared the butter chicken and malai chicken tikka, both of which were simply divine! These paired nicely with our scrumptious garlic naan and refreshing cocktails. Overall, this is a great restaurant offering authentic Indian dishes for very reasonable prices. I highly recommend this restaurant to any visitors to Singapore
5
It's been a while since we've found an Indian restaurant that serves food this good. Without a doubt it is the best Indian in Singapore. Aside from the food, what really sets this restuarant apart is the service. The waiters were excellent and really took the time to run through the menu and offer advice on different dishes. They were more than happy to modify dishes to suit those who didn't like food as spicy. Anyone in Singapore wanting Indian food should definitely choose the Curry Culture... We will be back
5
Thank you to all the staff at 'Curry Culture, Cuppage lane, for 2 fantastic meals over xmas period. Very welcoming staff and excellent value tasty indian food in a relaxed environment. Unpretentious and honest sums the place up. Toddler friendly...ie..bringing your own food if required isn't an issue (Manager even went to neighbouring restaurant to provide French fries. How nice of you!) Good size serves and value for money which is a struggle these days in the Lion City! Keep up the good work Fellas'!! Happy New Year from Perth!
5
And I know Indian food! I have visited here twice and have not been disappointed. Owner takes personal attention in ensuring that all guests are treated royally. The food is phenomenal. I had the lamb vindaloo both times. Take care when ordering spicy food by the numbers ... I like to think I can handle the heat but 6 was too much for me. I dialed it back to a 4 on my second visit which was plenty hot. Singapore is a very competitive restaurant market but The Curry Culture is doing very well. I fully expect super good food on my next visit. A must visit if you like Indian food
5
Thank you for a beautiful birthday dinner. The food was lovely and service was fantastic! We will be recommending you to all of our friends and family.

Last night was truly a surprise package in a good way.Even in the turential rain we dined alfresco in total comfort.We thought we had chosen what we wanted to order and the waiter offered us some ways of creating variety and we thought why not and yes we are thrilled we did.We did not order starters however they brought us out a small starter just so we could try something different it was simply a burst of Devine flavour we knew there and then that Tonight's meal would be one to remember.Yes they even have corona and cloudy bay, and the drink our 16 year old was recommended to drink she loved and ended up having 3 .The restuarant is in the middle of a dining strip many many choices live music the setting Is very stumlating and enjoyable .I am hard to please and we loved the service , food and ambience , exceptional value

Good food, bit on the expensive side, great location, not that comfortable seating, avoid going on crowded days such as public holidays (had a very bad experience with their service)
5
Visited for Christmas lunch.
Good service, staff were very helpful & foods are so delicious.
I liked " Lime juice with ginger" it was so refreshing.We will visit few more times :)
5
Had our Christmas lunch there.delicious food and excellent service.must try sakarkandi prawns,truly delicious.lot of options are available for vegetarians such as vegetable biryani, zeera rice,fried rice, mouth watering Indian curries and traditional Indian snscks such as samosa, pakoda. We tried ginger lime soda and minty mango lassi in drinks. Both were refreshing. It's truly a must go place!!!

Got there early on a Sunday night, our last night in Singapore, and were greeted warmly by affable and welcoming staff. They were most helpful in our choice of dishes, the quantity of food, the degree of spice and they accommodated our requests by even reducing the order portions of some items so that we can have room to try other things. Then we were presented with two wonderful tasting appetizers "on the house" followed by tandoori chicken, a delicious bindi (okra) curry, a cauliflower/potato curry and a velvety lamb korma. All the sauces were distinctive in flavour and nothing suggestive of the generic curry sauces of lesser establishments. All this was accompanied by Kashmiri naan and Tiger beers.The only negative was that the pappadoms were soggy and not crisp within minutes, mostly because of the high humidity of Singapore. It was a price to be paid for eating outside. So my advice... eat them quick when they come to the table!!Not a cheap night out but a delicious one. Beers at $9 a glass is a little steep I think. Would we return? absolutely, and we will add to the throngs of tripadvisor readers that sing their praises

Asked for chicken saag instead of lamb saag. Saag came out cold, the chicken was rubberised and had a hard outer layer... The saag curry itself was mild and lacked any taste.. on the up side the rice was great :).
5
I was here at the beginning of November and it was a very pleasant experience, I had Chicken samosa, saag gosht and gulab jumin for sweet all 3 courses were excellent especially the main course saag gosht this is the finest meal I have ever tasted and I have visited a lot of Indian restaurants I highly recommend this place to everyone Billy Inglis
4
We visited in November, it was my 60th birthday the next day,after our lovely curry meals I was presented with a desert which had a candle on, very nice gesture. Lovely meal and staff are very friendly
5
As always the food and service was excellent at the Curry Culture in Cuppage Terrace. We had saffron rice, chicken Tikka and lamb Korma. They were all amazing flavours and textures.We also tried the new Curry Culture in Robertson Quay. It was just as good. In addition I also ordered the bonless fish curry. It was exceptional. I shall be ordering it on my visit.
5
Well I am not a big fan of curry but I wanted my parents to try all different types of food while we were in Singapore. Upon review on Tripadvisor it seems this place was pretty reasonable so we gave it a try and I wasn't disappointed. Firstly the drinks came out promptly except for the water which at the time my daughter was already scrafing down the pappadoms and to her regret it was too hot. However after that the experience it was up hill all the way. They gave us a sample entree on the house which were a pretty interesting taste and when the main courses came out it was one of the best Indian food I ever had and I would like to think I have had a lot of curries in my life. In terms of service and friendliness this was what made the difference between a good restaurant and an excellent restaurant. The waiters was always around and they were friendly enough to hang around and have a chat. Overall I would recommend this place to people who value service as much as the quality of the food. Well Done
5
This place is one of the best north indian restaurants in Singapore. The service is awesome too.I highly recommend this place
5
We ate at The Curry Culture on Diwali of this year. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the food was absolutely incredible... the best meal we had in Singapore. I have two children younger than 10 years of age, and both of them enjoyed the meal as well
3
After seeing the reviews in trip advisor we were very excited.They first served with papad(which is nice) but the papad was bit soggy which they promptly replaced after informing. Maybe can check before serving.For starters we ordered Papdi Chat and we didn't like it too much(onion was missing..maybe that's how they make it)..The vegetables(paneer, daal makhni, raita) were good..but the Naan was a bit raw...Overall a decent restaurant.. As it is quite near to our hotel we would be probably be going there few more times.
5
We love Cuppage and the Curry Culture exemplifies why. The food is amazing and when combined by efficient friendly service, you can't go wrong. The guy front of house really makes you feel important to him but with a real warmth. The starters are exceptional and my Sag Gosht accompanied by an intense garlic nan was a highlight. Well Done
4
I was walking around Orchard Road and decided to stop in at the Curry Culture after reading so many good reviews. I was a few minutes early for lunch (they start at noon) but was seated right away anyway. Ajay the restaurant manager took the time to help me dial in the right spicy-ness level for my taste. Finally settling on a level 5 (out of 10) I waited for my meal with great anticipation. I started with the vegetable Mulligatwany soup which was very nice and added to my expectation for the lamb Vindaloo. Upon tasting the lamb Vindaloo, the spicy-ness was just right and the lamb was very tender. Very satisfying meal all around
4
Absolutely love this Indian place, I've been here few times now and can honestly say their fish curry is superb! Fish has this buttery feel to it, just melts in your mouth and the sauce is full of spices and flavours.I think the curry could have been a bit spicier but I think the staff didn't believe we could take it! If you are from Britain I would say their curries without extra spicy would be classed as mild. Not overly impressed with their popadoms though, not a true reflection of their lovely cuisine
4
Fantastic friendly staff that provided good service and a nice location as well. Garlic naan was on point and the chicken vindaloo was quite good.
5
We have always found it quite difficult to take the kids with us to Indian restaurants, but this place broke the mould! Staff were so friendly and helpful. Food was amazing and service was first class! Really recommend this place highly when visiting Singapore and staying nr or close to Orchard Rd. Well done guys great job

If you are looking for authentic Indian food avoid this place.I am very fond of Indian food. I visited this place after some extensive review and search hoping for some perfect Indian food in Singapore. My visit was extremely disappointing.I visited on 22nd November for dinner with family. The food was no way near to the authentic Indian food. We ordered non veg mixed platter, Nan, Veg Kadai and Biryani.After 35 minutes they served first dish starter which is below average taste .I probably not eat such a poor Kebab in any Indian restaurant, Veg Kadai was sour in taste and bitter. Nan was not well cocked almost raw. Biryani was very ordinary and no way comparable to Dum biryani.Moreover there was no service sense. They did not bothered to serve water for at least for kids ..we later requested to serve some water.At last we paid in cash and they did not bothered to return ramming amount 13 SGDThis place is not worth â€¦
5
I was actually just looking for a new place to try when I happened to see the reviews for this place. I've been here twice and didn't realize it was ranking high. It is completely deserving ! The food is fantastic ! Ambiance is great, nice little treasure trove of Resto in this lane, but this has to be the best Indian by far . Butter chicken, dhal , aloo gobi, all we're delicious.can't wait to go again
5
This is the place for indian vegetarian cuisine, excellent host and staff, yummmmy food and centrally located right opposite 313@somerset..a must visi
5
If quality Indian foods is what you are after then head directly to The Curry Culture in Robinson Quay .This restaurant is an absolute delight.Not only will you be delighted with the meals but the staff are excellent .For Singapore it is very well priced and for what you receive it is great valueThis is certainly one of the best Indian restaurants I have visited anywhere and I strongly recommend you add it to your "must do" list for when you next visit Singapor
5
We live in Singapore and visit this restaurant regularly with friends and business colleagues. The food is always excellent we have never had a bad meal there, the service is always very good,friendly and helpful. They always help in terms of meal choices, what goes together, how much to order and how the food should be spiced to your taste. I have taken visitors from India to this restaurant as well and they also really liked it.I would highly recommend this restaurant and if you visit as a family they are great with children
5
Another gorgeous meal at Curry Culture last night, food was delicious, the service is second to none and it's definitely one of our top restaurants in Singapore. Can't wait to go back and sure we will very soon
5
We chose to have a meal here on our first night in Singapore and it proved to be a smart decision. The food was exceptionally good and comparable to some of the best Indian meals I have tasted around the world, including many trips to India. It certainly isn't a cheap place to eat but by Singapore standards it is good value for money and if you enjoy Indian food then you must pay a visit - you will not be disappointed. We went back for a second visit on our last night when we returned to Singapore from our holiday in Lombok

After the deadly Song of India, this was a relief, and something of a contrast,being in the Singapore equivalent of Covent Garden rather than a Mausoleum. Excellent service: they try hard.I was advised I had ordered too much, which is good to know to know when you have not been there before. Delicious Indian road side snack freebie. Nice starters.My main course seemed like it had been prepared in advance and reheated, acceptable rather than great. Good choice of wine with a promotion of New Zealand Marlborough Sauvignon which is always acceptable.Overall, not ba

Rite behind the Center-point Mall on Orchard Rd. in the Cuppage Area is located the The Curry Culture. Amazing service, with truly finger licking food quality. They even customize as per your preference. Highly recommended for those looking for an amazing Indian Meal
5
I've tried many Indian eateries on Orchard Road, including the ones in the food courts of malls and restaurants but this one truly owned us. Great food, excellent service. Staff made every effort to make our dinner comfortable. They even engaged our 2 yr old daughter in activities and gave kid crockery for her. Must visit restaurant if you're fond of great food. The prices are on the higher side though.
5
We visited The Curry Culture while in Singapore last weekend. The reviews looked good and we had high hopes. We certainly weren't disappointed. The service was great from the second we arrived. The owner Sandeep has a great personal touch and was really helpful with our menu choices. It was definitely a case of helping us pick the right choices rather than selling us as much as possible. He recommended just the right amount and the food was great. Tasty, authentic and not at all greasy. A really enjoyable experience.
5
On our flight home from Europe we had a stop over in Singapore. We stayed at the Holiday Inn close to Orchard Rd. Looking for something to eat we come across The Curry Culture, a lucky find. great Indian food, great service and friendly staff. The owner Sandeep Sachar was very helpful. My opinion this is the best Indian food I have had in Singapore. I love Vindaloo (level 1-10) I picked number 4 but was a bit hot for me, Sandeep saw this and changed my Vindaloo to a lower spice level. If you love Indian food this is the place to go in Singapore
5
We stayed at the Holiday Inn in Singapore and found this place nearby on our first evening among a bunch of other restaurants. The experience was so good we came back again for our last evening in Singapore.The menu consists of familiar Indian dishes - with favorites like butter chicken - but also other interesting stuff we didn't know. Both times we ordered a nice selection of two meat/fish dishes and some side orders like naan bread and safran rice. All very good and it is highly recommended to share your dishes.The staff was super friendly, seemed really interesting in hearing about our visit in Singapore and in general just made our dinner a great experience.If you are staying at the Holiday Inn, we will defiantly recommend visiting this restaurant at least once
4
This place owned and run by Sundeep is nothing short of home-style indian cooking...In Singapore, there are many indian restaurants and this one is #1 in my book...their food is very tasty and spot-on in their level of spice...If you love Naan, theirs is a "wow"...The Vindaloo has a level 1-10, where a "10" is really a "14" so better have a hose nearby...The personable waiters and Sundeep himself make it a great place to dine
5
I visited for a meal with friends on Sunday evening and we were not disappointed. I had read the reviews beforehand and it was an excellent dining experience, with great food and good service. We were given complimentary appetisers to sample after our starters which was a nice touch. I am sure that the staff will not forget one member of our group! We'll be back, see you next year...
5
My colleagues and I visited the curry culture for a gathering and had the best food experience. Food was very authentic & tasty.. I wish I knew the staff's name, the staff was so helpful and had many suggestions for us.. We were also given complimentary indian desserts!.. Service rendered by staff was very personalised & we will surely return.. :

Went on Saturday night for a meal; we hadn't resevered but were lucky to get a table immediately. We were seated outside, however, because the flooring was wooden planks, the table shook every time a waiter passed by. Hence, we requested for a shift and were promptly moved to another table. Located along a chain of bars and restuarants in Cuppage, there is plenty of live entertainment on weekends. For appetizers we ordered one Chicken Mulligatawny soup and a plate of vegetarian samosas. The soup was nice, portion size strictly for one person, so can't be shared. There were 2 samosas in one plate so good for sharing between a couple. My companions who had the samosa quite relished it. For mains we got one Malai Kofta and a Goan Fish Curry with white rice. Thats where we had a problem. The Malai Kofta took long, but came hot with our order of breads. The dish was good in taste, 4 koftas, soft as they should be. However, the curry rice just didn't show up. Upon inquiring we were informed that the dish had been served to the wrong patrons. They do serve complimentary salad with certain dishes. After another 10-15 mins the curry was delivered to our table, the staff was profusely apologetic, but no rice! Finally after getting off the table and chasing somebody the rice was delivered in the next minute. The curry was quite tasty but didn't look anything like the Goan curry that I ate growing up. Must mention that the staff was courteous all throughout and apologized profusely on more than one occasion. Guess everybody has bad days, the food was well liked by all on our table, so will give it one more shot
5
During a brief stopover at Singapore, we opted for a meal here based on the great reviews on here. We have eaten at many Indian restaurants and were pleasantly surprised with the supreme quality of food here, probably one of the best mixed grilled, naan and curries we've had! Great, friendly service and value for money too. This place is very highly recommended
5
I am a big lover of Indian food and was not disappointed by this experience.I was staying at the Holiday Inn on Cavenagh Road and between the hotel and Orchard Road is Cuppage Terrace, a walkway of a dozen or so restaurants with outside seating located under a large canopy. This is one of 2 Indian restaurants (the other being the Maharajah) and I chose the Curry Culture due to the positive reviews.There was a lively atmosphere with most of the restaurants full.The menu is nowhere near as broad as in the UK. Nonetheless, it is good enough with plenty of variety. Drinks and food were promptly served and the waiter who served me was excellent, asking how spicy I would like the food and advising on the size of portions. Being hungry, I ordered onion bhaji to start followed by keema mattar with a keema naan and pilau rice. All of it was superb and I'll have no hesitation in visiting again
5
I tried this restaurant based on the reviews here and I can say I was not disappointed with the food. In particular I would recommend the tiger prawn stuff with crab but there are so many good dishes to try. In addition I had a delicious mango/rum cocktail. The proprietor and his staff are all extremely helpful and friendly
5
I have been to many Indian places all over the world and nothing beats this.. Forget the previous negative comments from othersGreat area and environmentAttentive and knowledgeable staff..even suggested that we ordered too much :)Thanks for a nice evening guys. I don't give many 5 stars :)Located in Orchard Square. So shopping first then this place..fits schedule well..only trouble if raining difficult to get taxi. But just walk to holiday inn express two minutes and get one ther

I love Indian food and this spot has awesome curries. They don't skimp on the flavor. I particularly love the butter chicken and the palak paneer. Service was warm and efficient.
5
We were in a mood for indian food and picked up this one on TA....what a luck ! Not only the staff is super friendly and helpful but the food is excellent !!! We tasted the chicken chilli cheese and it was sooo good ! Recommendations from the boss were perfect and we had a very tasty experience ! The prices are correct ( dont forget we are in Singapore !) and the al fresco dinning area very pleasant. We will definitely come back !
5
After a number of uninspiring meals in Singapore, we were immediately impressed by the welcoming, personable, friendly and relaxed atmosphere in Curry Culture.Our meals were outstanding (Dal, Rogan Josh, Chicken Korma.The service was second to noneSpecial thanks to Jimmy Mathew and the generosity of Sandeep Sachar.

Great food quality for good price 👍 and nice hospitality as well 👍 I'm writing this sentence because I need 100 characters to submit!

After reading many positive reviews on trip advisor we booked a table for my birthday over the phone. We arrived slightly late but the restaurant was empty so that wasn't a problem. Obviously the atmosphere was lacking but the customer service and food made up for it. We were swiftly seated and after ordering drinks received a complimentary Indian street food delicacy which was delightful.We asked if our curries could be made slightly hotter than on the menu and the polite waiter went into detail about exactly what heat we desired. The food arrived quickly and the waiter checked if our curries were to our taste, he offered to get the chef to make mine even hotter so it was how I like it. I half expected my curry to return cold after the chef had throw another few chillies in but to my surprise the curry returned sizzling hot and perfectly spiced.After we finished we spoke with the manager about our stay in Singapore and explained it was my birthday he returned with a chocolate brownie and ice cream with a candle in it! I never get deserts at Indians as they're normally a waste of time but this desert was delicious.Overall the customer service and food was excellent, well worth a visit if you're in the area
5
4 adults and 3 kids all had a great time. Food was fantastic. We had various starters and all were amazing. Main courses too were excellent. Kids had butter chicken and loved it, and couldn't get enough of the naan bread. The service was excellent and our waiter assured us we could have all the chicken dishes with chicken breast. Nice touch for fuss pots. Setting is great too, on Cuppage which is busy and full of life. If we're back in Singapore we'll be going back
5
We had a brilliant meal here!! The butter chicken was just amazing! Cooked to perfection. We were giving very tasty appetisers. The staff very so friendly and helpful. We'll worth a visit! Could not recommend more
5
Fabulous restaurant found by chance on our second night in town and visited again on our 4th night and my parents are going back tomorrow night. The staff were so incredibly welcoming and put us completely at ease bringing our 10 month old and 3 yr old out for dinner (they even remembered both our daughters names on our second visit), we felt like part of the family. Simply some of the best curries we have eaten ever. A great menu with such a wonderful variety of dishes. Definitely don't miss eating here
5
This was one of the best meals ever had, and a superb friendly approach from all staff made our family of 6 including 2 children very welcome and valued.The quality of all food from a number of visits was absolutely superb, flavoursome and just the right amount of 'heat'.All around a great experience to be savoured!!
5
We are a family of 4 with 2 children who all love curry. Everything we had was fantastic, from the service, to the flavours, to a few changes to the dishes we ordered. Everything was freshly prepared and the staff were very helpful. I just wish you were in the Middle East but my husband will definitely become a regular over the next year!
5
I have been here a few times, always excellent food and great service. The restaurant is on Cuppage Road, outside dining but covered. In the warm but breezy night air, with live music and a real buzz about the area, this is a great setting. The food is excellent. The staff are helpful and even want to stop you over ordering. The tandoori dishes on hot plates are excellent, especially the tiger prawns stuffed with crab. Get extra naan bread. The naan is good, but the portions a little on the small size.The quality and taste is excellent, BUT, it's not cheap. Then again nothing in Singapore is. Great food, setting and service. 3 out of 4 is till pretty good.
5
From arrival to departure, we were treated perfectly by Sandeep and his team, nothing at all was too much trouble. The whole team were friendly and very proud /knowledgeable about the food they were serving.The food was to say the least 'awesome'. Beautifully prepared / presented , the taste of the dishes were out of this world - my husband said ' I have never tasted a curry that good before' and believe me, he has had a few over the years. The ambience of the area where the Curry Culture is set was excellent and a great place to spend a few hours. If you want an excellent curry this is the place to go
5
Whenever coming to a new city, I find myself in search for an excellent Indian restaurant. Unfortunately, it is not always accomplished. I can be rather "picky" and can sincerely share that The Curry Culture food is excellent. Not oily, incredibly flavourful, to the precise spice/heat level you desire, perfect tender morsels of meat (not fatty or tough), and the amazing aromas.... so good!!The service is outstanding. Each of the staff truly seems to be happy and enjoying themselves. They also have the perfect blend of friendly and professional, engaging with all of their customers, adapting to the unique style and needs of each. They are very generous with the food, and their service. We love it and will be back. With friends
5
When with family and friends and searching for authentic Indian food, the Cuppage Terrace location is very convenient. Reviews were positive but did not prepare us for the excellent quality of each dish and the very friendly and efficient service.The curries were all spot on, we tried 4 different including the lamb rogan ghosh, all had distinctive tastes and even the children had great tasting chicken tikka.The whole group left being very satisfied, and looking forward to coming back

After 3 weeks on the road I fancied a proper Indian curry so did an internet search. This place came up near the top so headed over. The restaurant is in a busy and covered food court which gives the place a certain vibe. Service was fast and very friendly, they took the time to speak to me for some time and explain what they are providing. As a curry-head the menu looked broad and contained something for everyone. Both starters and mains were well cooked, presented well and tasty

I recently had a holiday in Singapore with my quite pregnant daughter. We visited The Curry Culture restaurant twice - the first time for a rest from orchard road and the second time because they were so accommodating and friendly the first time, we thought we would go back for a meal.Their lovely and attentive staff are very friendly and welcoming. As soon as they realised my daughter was pregnant, out came the cushion for her back. They allowed us to linger as long as we liked although we didn't eat the first time.The second time we went the food and again, the service were great. There is an extensive menu. Our food was delicious. We ended chatting for quite some time to one of the waiters. He was so nice.It is in a great spot! There were quite a few people there also, which is a good indication

There is no shortage of restaurants on Cuppage Terrance in Singapore but The Curry Culture is a great find. On the recommendation of my friend we went here last night. If you plan to dine after 6 pm I'd recommend a reservation as the place is popular. The reason it is so popular is that the food is great. I can't say any better. Authentic, good portions and served by very friendly staff. The only slight downside is that they do take awhile to cash you out. So if you are in a rush to go someplace after dinner take that into consideration and let them know. I'll be back here for sure

We stumbled upon this great restaurant during a stopover in Singapore. The meals were outstanding and the service was even better. The staff are super friendly and couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming. The meals were plentiful, tender and flavoursome. Happy hour of 2 for 1 drinks between 5pm and 7pm plus free appetizers to try left us with smiles on our faces and feeling appreciated as customers. Staff are up for a chat and appear proud to work for this wonderful little Indian restaurant. We will definitely be returning on any occasion that we find ourselves in Singapore

Visited this restaurant for my birthday a few weeks ago. The service was incredible.... once they heard it was my birthday, the staff poured us glasses of Prosecco and then the manager shared a glass with us. After that they brought us on a culinary journey through their Indian cuisine. I don't eat Indian very often, so I asked them to recommend their best dishes. All of the food was sublime.In particular they gave us both a little taste bomb as an appetiser.... it was a like a taste explosion of Indian flavours in my mouth.All in all, its so refreshing to meet people that are so passionate about their business.... particularly in a place like Singapore (which I found to be very false). These people have a genuine passion for their food and service.My only regret is that we don't go back a second time

I was working in singapore for a couple of years. Me n my wife were looking for a good indian restaurant. finally we came to know about this restaurant through one of my colleague. We had an awesome experience out there. The whole ambience was really nice and romantic. The food and service was excellent. Mr.Sandeep and team gave us good suggestion and service was quick. Still whenever i think of the malai broccolli i feel my mouth watering. Thanx to the chef

I have visited first time in Singapore. Food was great and customer service and hospitality was outstanding.Quick service and food taste was great. I visited from Melbourne and loved food. I will definitely come again once coming back to Singapore.Food is much better than Punjab Grill @ Marina bay Sands.All the best and hope you continue great taste in future.Nimesh Sha

We don't visit Indian restaurants in Singapore very often. And we have never visited the same restaurant twice, mainly because none really wowed us with their food. Which is why when we decided to visit The Curry Culture the second time within three months, it was with a lot of expectations and because we loved the food and service when we visited in April 2014. This is my second review for the place. The good and great - the service is still impeccable! Very fast (even on a weekend), always with a smile, concerned but not intrusive. The naans are still oh-so-soft and don't go chewy after sitting on the table for a few minutes. They have the best Jal Jeera ever and this time, even my husband ordered that skipping his usual drink. The Paneer Tikka was excellent - soft, rightly spiced and done to perfection. And on that particular day, much better than the non-vegetarian fare (as declared by my husband).The average - the Amritsari fish was below average and devoid of any flavor. We ordered the Dal Makhni, which was strictly ok and seemed to have some sort of color added to it (the color definitely wasn't from any spice). The mixed vegetable was ok.It was a disappointing second visit for us, more so because we went in looking forward to having a great meal after our first experience
4
I was looking for some vegetarian food and I came across this little place in the food court near my hotel. The staff were very helpful and their service was very prompt. The food itself was quite ok, though not spectacular.
3
We visited 2 times...Initially we ordered pure Vegetarian ( Dal makhani and Shani paneer and veg biryani ) the food was delicious and service was too good, specially we had sat outside...Second time we chose to sit inside the resturant as it was too humid so thought that AC would do the work for us and we ordered Non Veg ( Butter Chicken + Tandoori ) .......Butter chicken was toooo sweet,,,,,,and tandoori was not cooked up to the mark ........AC was not effective as the doors of resturant were open and and all smoke was coming out from the kitchen......So, for Veg lovers please visit and sit outside onl

***** (5 Stars) for Ambience***** (5 Stars) for Food***** (5 Stars) for Locationone of the finest Indian Restaurant in the heart of Singapore

Succulent meal, superfriendly staff. Asked to be suprised by the chef, we where blown away by the spices and flavours! Amazing:):):)We're going back.A must go in Singapore
5
We loved the Indian curries at this restaurant. Everything was tasty and delicious! It does come with a hefty tag though. We had one Lamb Korma, one Lamb Saag, Rice, Naan bread and 3 mango lassi. The naan bread was amazing and so was the Lamb Korma.The area is bustling with activity with live music that can be overheard from neighbouring locales. Staff were friendly and attentive.I would go again if I had the chance
5
Visiting Singapore means visiting Orchard road and if you are staying at Orchard road a nice Indian restaurant is icing on the cake. The ambience is nice, food is great and staff is excellent.Th location of restaurant Orchard road and near hotel Holiday is just too good
5
Located in a bustling area with lots of places to shop and have a few drinks. Food and service at the Curry Culture were perfect - It was so good I went twice during my 3 day stay. I ate the Murgh Tikka Masala and a garlic naan bread which was delicious. The second time I had a Vindaloo made with the Chicken Tikka spiced at a level 3 - this was slightly sour tasting which made it very enjoyable and interesting. I will visit again the next time I am in Singapore
4
We have just eaten at the curry house and we all agreed the food and the staff were very friendly so much so we found our way back for the second time in a week
3
Visited this with family and my brother who is visiting from Canada. Service is good but food is average. Also price a bit on the higher side questioning the value for money. Ambience is not so great either. Overall an average place to eat Indian food
5
had a great and friendly night with the best food we ate in singapore,the staff were great and when we told sandeep we were celebrating 30 years together we were given 2 glasses of champers,we would have gone back again but had so much to do in such a short time,if you love curry and are in singapore you must visit here
4
Really enjoyed our meal at The Curry Culture tonight. The head waiter was very welcoming and fun to talk with and had many honest and helpful comments to make about the menu; which was complete and full of variety. We had lamb chops which were really good as well as indulging in the tried and tested chicken tikka masala which didn't disappoint. Beer was reasonably priced as well for Singapore standards. The other thing to note with the area if you've not been is that it's got a really nice outdoor ambience with a covered area in a pedestrianised street with lovely old buildings down each side and plenty of choice in bars and other food places if you wanted to come back (obviously go to curry culture first!)We will definitely go back
4
nice food overall. thin staff but good service. drinks are expensive. expect to pay 100 SGD for a full meal for two. having said that the place is vibrat and other restaurants by the side have all tables full. Must try.
5
We had an awesome dinner at The Curry Culture at Cuppage. And the waiters were extremely nice and very helpful. The food tastes amazing & if you are ever in an Indian cusine mood, don't miss out this place ! I didnt get the name of the guy that assisted us during dinner that night, but a big thank you to him !

My wife and I visited The Curry Culture in late April based on the reviews we had read on Tripadvisor. We weren't disappointed!! When we arrived, Sandeep, the host and owner, immediately engaged with us. He was attentive but not obtrusive and was clearly passionate about his food and had a strong customer focus.I love a vindaloo and I like it hot so I immediately ordered a No.7 on the heat scale. Sandeep graciously and discreetly suggested that a No. 5 might be more appropriate and he was spot on. I was mopping the brow and clearing the sinuses after the third mouthful so it was certainly hot and spicey but not uncomfortably so. The meat melted in your mouth and the sauce was delicious. Sandeep had somehow matched me and the heat rating perfectly.My wife prefers a Butter Chicken and it was, well, buttery. She declared it "the best ever" and I must admit it was pretty damn good even though it's not my preferred dish.All in all we had a great night and a top meal. Sandeep was the perfect host and very keen to make sure everything was to our liking.....and it was

The star of this place is, hands down, the SERVICE which we have missed even in the fine dining Indian restaurants in Singapore. We ordered their Goan Vindaloo Curry (which was good) - and for this you can specify the spice level you want on a scale of 1 to 10. Since my husband prefers spicier food, he went ahead and ordered a level 5 (though the staff taking the order had mentioned that level 3 is spicy enough). The owner, Mr. Sachar, came with our main course and very graciously (and wittily) cautioned us about the level 5 curry. He recommended that my husband try the curry and if he found it too spicy, he would get it toned down promptly - which is what happened eventually :). The food is great - and I had one of the best Jal Jeera ever here which tasted fresh and not made from a pre-made mix. A pleasant surprise was that the naans/breads stayed soft even though they had been on the table for a long time, unlike the usual Indian breads at other places which turn rubbery and chewy after a few minutes. The staff kept checking with us after each course to ensure that the food and drinks were to our liking.We would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants good Indian food served with superb service
5
Like this place generally.. This time came with my parents for a relatively early dinner after an exhausting day traveling around Singapore.. The staff is always smiling and give the feel that they are not only enjoying the place, but love serving the food.. Food quality is always nice! Never have to wait too much for the food.. Their Indian cocktails are great too.. Highly recommend this place for good Indian dining.
5
I was told of this restaurant by a local who said it served some of the best curry in Singapore - they were right! Seriously good food with equally good service. The staff were help and personal but not pushy.We went for my partner's birthday which I jokingly mentioned to our waiter at the end of the dinner and he bought out two glasses of champagne with a chocolate brownie dessert! Fantastic night and will be sure to return next time
4
the restaurant is good especially to eat in the evening in this area al fresco. The service was good and the food was good also. Indeed the taste is great, and lot of choice. Prices are ok considering the area. I would say that the taste is adapted to european, but you wont feel sick after...if you are an expert in Indian food, I would suggest to consider a more specific indian restaurant;Samosa was good, rolls starters too and vegi balls excellent. The curry vegi and lamb was good too I recommand. The chicken tandorri was not terrific, would consider.300 SGD FOR 4 PEOPLE with 2 bottles of wine fy

If you want to please all your senses. Go to The Curry Culture and have a meal. No matter what you choose, you will not get disappointed.

Apparently The Curry Culture has been in existence for a mere eighteen months and to have risen so far in customer's esteem over such a short time is a great tribute to the owner and his team as there can be few more competitive arenas for restaurants than Singapore.Personally I loved the setting, plenty of outdoor seating in a strip which consists several alternative restaurants, background music coming from somewhere and all the while a buzz of eclectic diners amidst a blur of highly proficient yet non intrusive waiters delivering terrific, tasty food.I was joined by my son and his partner and the three of us selected the following: Chicken tikka, Goan fish curry, Macchi Amritsari, Malai Chicken Afghani, Paneer Amritsari, One Naan Butter, 2 Saffron rice, 1 Mango Lassi and 4 Kingfisher beers. Totalling 163.60 SD which we considered great value.The highlight for me was the tenderness and sublime taste of the chicken dishes although I enjoyed a sample of everything.In conclusion, fabulous food, charming and knowledgeable proprietor and wonderful night time atmospher
4
My husband and I enjoyed a lovely meal with very good service on a busy weekend night. We had the tandoori platter with chicken, fish, prawn and lamb, and chicken tikka masala accompanied by saffron rice, roti, butter nan and a delicious dhal makhani (a personal favourite). The food was well cooked, hot and spicy. The dhal was particularly good with a nice kick. Staff were very friendly and attentive. The aniseed selection at the end certainly helps the digestion
5
Had the butter chicken for dinner and it's easily the best I've ever tasted. Amazing flavours and colours. It's right next door to the Holiday Inn Orchard Road.
5
From first impressions to last, the service and food are excellent.Greeted at the entrance by courteous staff, who were willing to discuss the menu and make recommendations. There is both covered “outdoor” seating and indoor seating. The former is pleasant but can get a little noisy with all the bars and other restaurants in the alley.The staff were, without exception, highly professional, courteous and knowledgeable about their food – to the extent of explaining how a certain dish should be best eaten. Willing to make recommendations and not overselling.We settled on “dry” lamb chops (i.e. not in sauce) and papdi chaat to start. The former was tender, flavourful (not overpowered by spice) and cooked well in the tandoor. The latter, a common Indian street food, was a good blend of textures and flavours. ($26 & $8, respectively)The butter chicken was superb – creamy sauce with tender, tasty chicken. The dal makhani was tasty (same sauce as chicken) and went down well with garlic naan. ($19, $12, $5ea, respectively).Three types of aniseed palate cleansers were presented with the bill. Each with its own interesting taste.If there’s one negative, it’s the Bollywood movie playing on a large screen in the background (sound down). The authentic food renders such attempts at ambience enhancement unnecessary.At a total bill for two of $105 without alcohol, it’s not traditionally cheap Little India fare, but the consistent high quality of the food and the delightful service make it a definite recommendation

return visit did not dissapoint, great hot lunch & cold beer. Owner remembered me from last visit - amazing
5
Excellent meal and first class service with a smile. Great tasting traditional and regional dishes fully explained by passionate staff. A must try when in Singapore. Well priced, good sized portions and fresh ingredients
5
We visited this place after reading such lovely reviews from everyone on Tripadvisor. Well it was a worth a visit. The ambiance of the place is lovely, comfortable seating. A really good choice for vegetarians. Overall this is a lovely place to have your lunch or dinner. Food is very tasty and best part there is not much of oil in it like other places.Our server was very kind and explained us that these dishes are spicy. Try the Pinacolada. Its a lovely drink they make.The only issue for me was the tables placed for indoor were very very close. You could hear what the next door people are saying and we had some really loud people sitting next door
5
The service was outstanding and very quick. Highly recommend tandoori vegetables and lamb vindaloo number 6 in hotness which my husband absolutely loved, steamed rice and the most delicious garlic naan that I have ever tasted. With the beautiful Singapore weather it is great to be able to sit outside but still undercover if it rains. Would definitely come back again and recommend to friends.
5
Very aromatic dishes especially the fish curry and vegetarian dishes: and try the apple and cardamom cocktail too...
5
Orchard Road area can be tricky for good restaurants, and they are usually quite expensive. The Curry Culture has comfortable indoor and outdoor seating on Cuppage Terrace. There was a great range of curries, but perhaps most importantly they offered an excellent kids menu. Our 3 youngsters chose fried fish, which came with either rice and vegetables or cheese naan. It was declared the best fish they'd had in ages! Portion sizes were generous, and all the adult food was also very tasty
4
Food was tasty and spicy enough :-)Service experience was extremely good with smiles and brilliant recommendations.
5
I've been here so many times and have never had anything other than a wonderful experience. The family who runs it truly care about their patrons and make you feel at home in their restaurant. The food is superb and the portions are generous. I can't recommend this place enough. Tip- try the pink elephant sparkling wine... It's delicious
5
We asked the waiter to surprise us with a variation of Indian dishes we could share, where we only indicated we did not want meat, and that we did not want it too spicy. The rest was magic. Very good food, very nice waiters
1
DISSAPPONTED We went there with high expectations bec of the TA ratingsThe food was mediocre but prices were high. The setting was very ordinary, akin to air-con coffee shop The service was friendly but nothing exceptionalOur gripe is about the food mainly. How can they justify such high prices by reporting to use quality ingredients but that does not translate into quality food
4
Visited this restaurant in January, I was travelling along which can often be a lonely experience eating out, however the staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming and the food was superb.I had the beer battered fish to start with followed by the chicken Jalfrezi, both were excellent and well presented etc.Both the owner and head waiter took the time to come over and talk to me etc and appeared to care which is always nice. Only a short walk from Orchard road and definitely the place to go for good indian food
5
This restaurant really lived up to its reputation. We went there as a family of four on holiday and they were so caring. They even remade my duaghters prawn dish as she thought it wad too spicy. The manager/owner took an active intrest in all dining guests.Simply great food, great service from a caring team.I would definitely reccomend this restaurant
5
Each time we visit Singapore, it is a must that we dine at the Curry Culture. The service that Sandeep, Jimmy and their staff provide is excellent. The food always arrives in a very timely manner, and always tastes excellent. My wife and I especially enjoy the Lamb Korma. It is to die for. Sandeep always tells us the ingredients and explains how the dish is prepared. We always sit outside as we like the atmosphere which is very vibrant.Sandeep and Jimmy always take the time to talk to customers about not only the restaurant, but where visitors are from or where they are travelling to next. We had reccommended the CC to a gentleman we met in our hotel who said he had dined here and that is was far superior to another Indian restaurand a few dors away. I thoroughly reccommend dining at the CC

My husband and I ate at Curry Culture bc of the reviews on Trip Advisor. Seriously guys? why the high review....The food was average or below. If you want really good Indian food, this is not the place, and frankly I'm not sure if Singapore has one. We ordered Saffron Rice, Butter Chicken, Chicken tikka masala, and naan bread. The food was average, not amazing at all. After reading the reviews, I thought I was going to have the best indian food in my life. The chicken wasn't the best quality either. The location is great, but there are PLENTY of great restaurants on/near Orchard Road. The service was excellent too, but the food is more important than the service of course
5
During my recent visit to Cuppage Terrace, I was passing by this line of restaurants and I saw an Indian restaurant. I received a very warm welcome by Mr. Sandeep and Mr. Jimmy on my arrival. At the first glance of the place I thought it would be fantastic and unusual. You even exceeded my expectations …. The food is wonderful and the service provided there is impeccable!! The best thing I found out is, that they are experienced enough to suggest you the food to eat, depending on your taste and mood. In Singapore, I know many places, who fool the customers in the name if Indian food. But it is not the case here. The politeness and Friendly behaviour of the staff adds up a good taste to the food. And the location and Ambience adds up more stars to it. I am a regular customer now and would suggest everyone else also, that If you are looking for some real Indian food with good taste, you must pay a visit to The Curry Culture.Cheers !

We love eating Vindaloo curry as it is spicier than other curries. The 1st time we tried the Vindaloo curry was level 12 and it wasn't spicy enough for us so 5 days later, we went back to The Curry Culture again and this time round, met the boss himself - Mr. Sandeep Sachar. Told him we wanted spicier than level 12 and he specifically went to speak to the chef and made level 14 for us! It was superb and the best curry. I want to thank Mr. Sandeep for his hospitality and personalised service. Also the servers, they are very accommodating and friendly. For anyone who are looking for good curry, you may want to take your feet to The Curry Culture From: Farina & Leslie Date of Visit: 12 & 17 Jan 201
5
Had a great dinner here, we sat outside and loved the bustling atmosphere. The service was great, our waiter took time to explain the dishes on the menu and was happy to make recommendations which all turned out to be delicious. He also checked how long we wanted between courses which was nice. Overall a great meal, we'll be back
5
We are an Australian family who love curry. We went for a walk down Orchard road and came across Curry Culture. What a find! The waitstaff were knowledgable about the dishes and recommended an entree which was just delicious. The mains of lamb chop masala, chicken tikka masala and dhal makhani were perfectly cooked and only clean plates went back to the kitchen. Not the cheapest curry but certainly one of the best
5
We moved to Singapore recently and friends introduced us to Curry Culture, as they eat there regularly and love the place. We have now eaten here 5 times, most recently with our family visiting over Christmas. On every occasion the food and service have been excellent. We have tried and enjoyed a variety dishes, although my husband was a bit disappointed with the Goan fish curry, my favorite is still the Murgh Tikka Masala. We have been in on very busy evenings and service is always friendly and pretty quick too and the ambience is so lovely we are never in too much of a hurry anyway. We are originally from Glasgow, which has many excellent Indian restaurants and we rate Curry Culture as good as many of those and even better the outdoor eating is considerably warmer
1
WE were passing by these rows of shops & popped in here as the ambience was interesting. When we checked the menu & prices, we found that it was a little upmarket so our expectations were also higher. The starter came in after a pretty long time & it was oily & certainly ordinary. Next the mains - just mediocre & I certainly wouldn't have paid that much for such food. Am I paying for the ambience? This is ridiculous
5
Had a very enjoyable family meal here.Good central location, choice of indoor or outdoor seating.A complimentary amuse bouche set the tone and our starters of Samosas & Bhajis were also good.Mains of butter chicken, Malabar fish curry and bhuna ghosht hit the spot as did the lightest, crispiest butter naan I've ever had.Price was reasonable for the quality of food
4
I stumbled along this indian restaurant a while back and have kept coming back everytime i am in Singapore and in the area.........it is located very close to the 'Tandoor' restaurant in the Holiday Inn Orchard Road, however even though the 'Tandoor' does great indian food, i have a preference for the Curry Culture restaurant in Cuppage Terrace.Main reasons, everything is fresh. It tastes great and very well presented - simple and easy. Not sure how they cook their food but i don't have to revisit it several times a day after my meal (if you know what i mean!!!). The service is great, very individual. I honestly believe that the staff really care about their patrons and listen to their needs. This quality is missing in a lot of restaurants these days.The evening atmosphere is great, the prices are reasonable and you come away with a very good feed.I recommend this place for great indian food...........check it out and for Sandeep when you get there!!
5
My friend and I decided to visit The Curry Culture based on the excellent TA reviews and as we were shopping on Orchard Road that day. We were not disappointed.The service from the outset was excellent and the owner was also there and seemed very passionate about providing a good service as well as excellent food. The poppadoms and sauces were really nice and just the right amount for the two of us. We ordered the vegetarian Punjabi samosas for starters which tasted amazing. I ordered the paneer makhanwala and my friend the chicken tikka masala together with naan breads and rice. The portion sizes were perfect and the paneer was really yummy. There is a large selection of vegetarian food to choose from which was great and it seems each item on the menu has had a lot if thought put into it to ensure each dish is perfect. I am a curry lover and would class this place as good value for money. The restaurant is located just off Orchard Road in a beautiful setting. We sat outside and enjoyed the music and great atmosphere. When I am in Singapore again I will definitely be back and would recommend The Culture Club to anyone looking for an excellent Indian dining experience.
5
My husband and I love our Indian food, and on our last night in Singapore looked online for the best Indian in town. The Curry Culture did not disappoint, beautiful food and friendly service. The owner was so friendly and informative. Will definitely come back on our next trip!
5
My boyfriend had been to Curry Culture on his last visit to Singapore and when we visited Singapore for Christmas with friends it was his firm recommendation that we dine at Curry Culture one night. Service was excellent, Sandeep remembered my boyfriend and gave us all a lovely welcome and waiters provided very good service. Food was excellent, there were six of us dining there, all British and with high curry expectations!! We had a range of dishes and we were all very happy with them. Price was reasonable, will definitely visit again. Many thanks to the staff for ensuring a good night out in Singapore at Christmas time
5
My girlfriend took me to Curry Culture after stumbling across it. Being English I like to pride myself on my curry knowledge and taste. First of all we were greeted by Sandeep at the door who welcomed us as if we were VIP's. My girlfriend had been there once and he remembered her. After consulting the menu I sought his advice on a few areas. Both of us are vegetarians, I knew what tastes I liked but didn't know how that translated into the name of curries. Sandeep was great in giving a detailed explanation to ensure I was happy. Drinks arrived and were very reasonably priced. I might normally say that this is a great mid week venue, but I due to this experience its an anytime experience for me. The food arrived in a very short time frame and you could tell it was made to order. Sandeep could tell I was slightly indecisive about the choice of curries and brought a taster of one of them to help me decide for next time.All in all, a three course meal with a few beers came to just over $100 which is hard to find in Singapore. The whole experience of really great food, amazing service and great price point makes this one of my favourite spots in Singapore right now.One other thing to mention is the surroundings, you are set in a very nice colonial part of Singapore. You can hear the band from next door, who provide a nice soundtrack to the meal.If you like Indian give it a try you wont be dissapointed 
4
The food is awesome out of the world. Flavours and spices were perfect. Hydrabadi baigan is must try. Looking at food we ordered masala tea, which wad pathetic. In all a must try in Singapore.
4
My Singapore friends took me to this restaurant and said this is the best Indian curry in this town . I totally agreed with them . The curry is not too spicy as others. They are so delicious . The staff here is so friendly. They are willing to show us more information about curry culture . We have a great memory. The price is a little bit expensive ( but a little ). We will be back if we have a chanc
4
We enjoyed a splendid evening at The Curry Culture earlier this monthFood and service was very good, especially the restaurateur himself who had an extremely welcoming mannerWould recommend without questio
2
The lamb vindaloo was decent, and that you can define the level of hotness (1 to 10) is a nice feature.All in all everything was of a good quality, but you can get Better food at certain similar restaurants in little India, for less than Half the price.Of course you pay a bit for the setting, but more than double the price?I won't be back
4
Very nice food, and authentic ! (Despite the name, which suggests "generic Indian / British-Indian curry house"!) Cuppage Terrace has a great atmosphere, and I enjoyed the food in this place. Good selection available also. The Indian drinks were a bit strong-tasting (i.e. mango lassi too sweet, chaas too salty) but otherwise great
5
We ate here on Tuesday, Dec 11th. The food was delicious and portions very generous. There's a real buzz about the place outside though we preferred the air conditioned interior on a very warm evening. The Papdi Chatt was wonderful....it came as an appetiser on the house. Sandeep was a very friendly host, guiding us through the menu and ensuring we didn't over order (contrary to most experiences I've had ordering curry!). The Curry Culture is really worth seeking out if you are visiting Singapore
4
Went there to for dinner. Made a reservation a day before. No issue. The following day they greeted warmly and was expecting us. We choose to sit indoors as we wanted less noise and more privacy. I think the owner was around and came to check how's the food and whether we are happy which is good service. We ordered the tiger prawns stuffed with crabmeat. It is very delicious. As for serving wise, it comes with only 2 pieces. Additonally we ordered the chicken tikka masala curry, rice n garlic nun, chicken tikka and spinach. As we wanted some curry which is more suitable to go with our rice and nun, we asked the waiter for some curry. The owner came over and totally understand our need and gave us some for free!Overall, we are extremely with the service and food. As for serving wise, could have skipped the chicken tikka and spinach. We were too greedy and ordered a bit too much. Anyway, the food comes pretty fast so you can always add order more later
4
Staffs are excellent. Ambience is 4 stars. Menu 5 stars. Cooking 4 stars. Overall 4 stars.their vandaloo is not real one . I get the smell of tomatoes in stead of Indian spice. Soup is excellent. Samosa excellent. Lassi excellent.
5
What an experience. The flavours, textures and tastes of this restaurant leave nothing to be improved upon. The food was unbelievable. We have never had such good Indian cuisine in Asia, the Americas, Europe or Australia. It was phenomenal. The only situation to be aware of is it you sit outside you will be right in the middle of a busy strip of restaurant/ clubs that are very annoying and loud. The music blends with other music and creates an awful atmosphere. However, DO NOT pass up on this place if you love Indian food.
5
let me start off by saying that before writing this review i read a couple of the terrible and poor reviews and i was pretty shocked at what i was reading i could not imagine something further form the truth, Our experience went above and beyond. The service was impeccable, the friendliness of the staff was great and overall a great dining experience. I guess to each his own!!Sandeep the owner, took every opportunity to come and talk to us and suggested what to eat, when ordered a 4th curry he said that's just way too much food. Lots of other places would have just let us order to rack up the bill, which i thought was a very professional touch. His team also was pretty good being very attentive and checking in on us.Now lets get to the food, the papadi chaat was absolutely out of this world, one of the best i have eaten in a long time since moving to Singapore, it would rival lots of chaat shops on the streets of Mumbai!! We also had the Malai Brocolli, which at first is not a vary common dish you would see in many indian restaurants, but it was absolutely delicious!!, it would have been better if it was a just bit spicier. For main course, we had the butter chicken, hyderbadi bhaingan and paneer makhani all held its own and the curry was very good. The texture of the paneer was just stunning, it was so soft ,melt in your mouth paneer which i have never ever eaten in Singapore ( because you dont get it in Singapore, the restaurant imports it from india).If i had any qualms with this place, it would be the "indian cocktails", the flavours of the drinks were not at all indian, So some improvement on that would make this a place a well rounded restaurant.As for the price, well yes it maybe slightly on the expensive side, but we thought it was worth every penn

Visited The Curry Culture on last day on honeymoon - went purely from reviews on Tripadvisor and wasn't disappointed! Wonderful attentive staff, good service particularly from the manager, Sandeep. Food was perfect, chicken of good quality and delicious spice, complimentary champagne at end of the meal was a lovely touch. Would definitely revisit if we return to Singapore and recommend to all!

Recently went to The Curry Culture for dinner and wow! was it good! The menu is extensive but not overwhelming and the servers are helpful in suggesting good choices. The staff were amazing, attentive and friendly. I have had lots of Indian food in my life and often leave places feeling disappointed, not this time! The ambience is also nice, we ended up eating inside as it was quite loud outside but outside has a cool vibe. Next time I'm in Singapore, I'll definitely be back
5
I have visited many Indian restaurants around the globe and for cost, service and quality of food, the Curry Culture is up there with the best of them. I live in Singapore and can honestly say that this place is well worth a visit as I return time and time again. Sandeep is a true host and his team really go out of their way to treat you the way you expect. A little gimmick is the heat ranges offered but to say in my opinion the Level 10 Lamb Vindaloo definitely get's the job done. You will not be disappointed visiting this fabulous hidden gem
4
A very warm welcome from the owner and all the staff were delightful. Food was authentic Indian - mixed styles from the different regions.. and all delicious. After UK "Indian" restaurants largely run by Bangladeshis, this is a really welcome change... food (and spices) are properly cooked for a change! You can eat of the outdoor terrace or inside - outdoors is nicer. Lively area as well.This is not the best Indian food i have ever had but is certainly up in the top 10 or so..
4
this restaurant is quite small if you wanted to be seated indoors but has a large outdoor sitout.but the outside is a bit noisy with loud music from the nearby restaurants.The ambience of this place is not much to talk about, but the food here is absolutely delicious and flavourfull, would definitely recommend this for great indian food
5
I come from a part of England where there are some fabulous Indian restaurants, cafes and chaat houses. This was easily the best chicken tikka dish I've ever had - the perfect sizzling blend of taste, spices and tender, barbecued chicken. Sandeep was the perfect host. He read my mind perfectly - I really wanted a barbequed dish and to compensate for any potential dryness in my order he offered to provide a wonderful curry sauce for as a side dish for free - perfect with the garlic naan. Also, when I ordered a beer one of the young, friendly waiting staff brought me a room temperature bottle - Sandeep came and replaced it with a cold one and then said the other one would be waiting for me in the fridge, again for free! I didn't get to drink that beer - my time in Singapore was short this time around, and I left without saying goodbye as well. Thanks Sandeep for fabulous food - will drop by again one day and have that beer
5
We did tell the owner/manager that if they could deliver to the UK they would have our business for ever! We had read the reviews on TA and really liked the sound of it, so, after a trip to Orchard Road we planned to eat there. We found it quite easily and were a bit put off by the road where there was a long line of restaurants with outside seating in the centre, a lot of which had TVs on (inc this one). But the reviews we're so good we came anyway and were very glad we had!The service was lovely -really helpful -and help was on hand to help choose. The food was delicious and worth the money which wasnt cheap but reflected the quality of the food
5
I along with my family visited this restaurant for dinner on all days of our stay in Singapore.The ambience of the restaurant is good. The staff here is very warm. Mr. Sandeep, the owner is very friendly n gave us some valuable tips.The vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian curries were excellent. The pomfret curry needs a special mention. The fish was fresh n well cooked.Also the papdi chaat I had here is the best till date.I recommend this place to all who wish to taste indian food at its best!Thank you, 'The Curry Culture' for a delicious experience
5
Super helpful friendly staff and genuine about it. They do care that you have a good meal. I couldn't decide so they just made me small portions of 3 things.Best Papadi chaat ever! The chicken and lamb were quality meat, slowly cooked and melt in the mouth tender. The curries should have been spicier. I think they've toned down the chillies for broader appeal, but that is easily fixed for text time. And there will be a next time. I usually trek to little India for the best curry but now I can get one off Orchard Road. This place is not as cheap, but still good value
4
I cant believe I can find the good curry restaurant in Sing. We had many sorts of curry : chicken and seafood. They all are delicious not too spicy . Moreover we had also lamb and saffron rice . We enjoy seafood too with crab and prawn . Its taste s so wonderful as well as the presentation . Atmosphere s good with friendly staff . The design of restaurant is beautiful. We love this plac

Just returned from the Curry Culture at Cuppage, Singapore. We resolved to write this review because this has become our favourite lunch venue in Singapore; we have been several times, always ordered something different and never been let down. Today the lady had the prawns with crabmeat inside, done in the tandoor. It was perfect. I had the bhuna lanb and was impressed. It was good quality meat, in good quantity and the masala was perfect. It hit all the aromatic spice hot spots - one could taste the cloves, cinnamon and cardamom. So often the masala is 'stale' but not here. Likewise the bhindi which was one of my favourite vegetables was ideal. The vegetable was cooked but with enough substance to be crunchy. I use this as a sort of discriminator dish to distinguish between restaurants because it takes a lot of trouble to prepare this vegetable fresh and properly cooked. Well done, Curry Culture, from day one you have never let us down

Service was very good, the owner was very polite and welcoming. When it comes to food:-Starters: onion bhaji, didn't leave much of an impression; Adraki Rawa machi - deep fried fish was very good but arrived without the yoghurt dip. -Mains: Butter chicken - the highlight; Goan fish curry and Lamb Korma tasty but nothing to be missed. Tandori chicken a bit of disappointment, chicken was too dry. Portions were definitely too small for what we paid.Pricing is a disaster, especially for the basics like 5$ per naan, 8$ for Saffron rice and 6$ for coke.. come on.
5
On our first night in Singapore we visited this restaurant whist trying to find another - what a good decision to go to here instead. We had the Korma and Jalfrezi, which were both divine. Service was impeccable, and we were happy to go back for a second time two nights later. Didn't check TripAdvisor before, but on writing im so glad this restaurant is in the top 50 and getting the credit it deserves. Will come back next time im in Singapore :)
5
I visited the curry culture for the first time without reading any reviews.There onwards I am a regular visitor of this restaurant, the only reason is the taste and quality of the food and the service.I tried most of the dishes there both on and off the menu.From the first day onwards, the treatment and service provided by the people there gave me a homely feel and that still continues.If you are visiting curry culture, don't miss the pomfret tandoori and lamp chop fry..Thanks to Sandeep, Jimmy,Ravi and other crew, the care and attention you have provided is spell bound. You might feel the food little expensive but the taste and quality of the food worth a bit more.
2
Me and my wife dine in last wkend, food and service was excellent, especially chicken tikka sizlers burp!Unfortunately i went to wash my hand to restroom i saw the waiter giving the used condiment sauce from orher table and the chef was giving him the instruction not to waste the used one, this guy just took a new bowl and fill the used condiment on that.... i think these guys are poor in hygiene.. mabe this is my last visi
5
I wanted to check out Curry Culture purely because of the great reviews I had read on trip advisor specially about Mr. Sandeep and must say I was not disappointed one bit after meeting him. We went for dinner the next day and as expected Mr. Sandeep took care of every small detail personally. As I wanted to try Butter Chicken, I was asked whether I want it in Delhi style (spicy) or Mumbai style (sweeter). When not satisfied still it was immediately sent to spice up more.We were given a complimentary plate of Ras Malai at the end of our meal, highly appreciated. Pricing slightly on the higher side but worth a visit specially due to the generous attitude of Mr. Sandeep :
5
This is a restaurant to be visited, whether you are a resident or a tourist. The food is fantastic and the value is spot on. The service is extremely efficient without feeling like they are hovering. I will definitely be going on a regular basis. We sat outside, a lovely street with live music. I think I would like inside next visit, to see which is better. My wife is not a spicy hot fan and she did find the standard dishes on the limit of comfortable, she requested more mild option and they produced with little to no loss of flavour.
5
We stopped here because of the trip advisor app near me now function and were not disappointed. All the food was excellent and service was slick. We WILL be back
4
This was my first visit and I enjoyed it very much. I chose the lamb gosht, saffron rice and plain nann, plus a half portion of yellow daal. Everything was delicious and nicely presented. I sat inside, but there is plenty of outside seating in Cuppage Terrace where there are many restaurant choices. Service was friendly and efficient. Indian food often seems the same all around the world, but it's not always done well. Here it is, so I'm happy to recommend The Curry Culture
5
We love to go to the Curry Culture at Cuppage Terrace. If it was up to our girls we dine there every Sunday! The staff is always very friendly and the service is excellent! The food is delicious and the butter chicken is to die for! We have been there many times already and it is definitely our favorite Indian restaurant
5
Sandeep and Jimmy thank you for a great dining experience. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we stepped foot in the door. The food was lovely. We always struggle to get my daughter to try new foods, but she enjoyed the lamb korma. I guess we will be having it when we get back to Australia now. My wife ordered the vindaloo four chilli hot. We shared this and thoroughly enjoyed it. My rear end paid for it the next day though (lol). The personal attention Sandeep showed us was great. We had conversations on Indian foods, cultures and experiences. Thank you we will be back
5
Cuppage terrace can be a mixed bag, but this restaurant is just fantastic! The food is consistently great, appetizing, with right-sized portions. The owner/manager is genuinely friendly, and the setting is modern and very pleasant. Easy one to recommend
4
Had a great meal here. Very friendly staff. Sat outside which was very noisy. On both sides there are bars playing music, one Reggie and one rock. The restaurant was playing a Bollywood movie on a screen. What a mixture of beats! Didn't spoil the food though.
4
We visited the Curry Culture on our first visit to singapore after looking at the reviews. The staff are nice, very friendly and accomodating. The food is delicious, we ordered a chicken biryani which was nice and also a samosa chaat which is the best dish! Loved it. The only issue we had was the prices are a bit on the high side but i guess you accept that as you are in SIngapore. Other then that fab food
5
we came across this lovely restaurant while out for a walk we are so glad we found it have now been twice during our stay in singaporeThe manager/owner was very welcoming and discussed the menu with us (on our 2nd visit he brought us a small dish to try) Food was delicious and nicely presented. a good choice on the menu .There is an outside seating area and inside.We hope to make it back for a visit before returning hom
5
Been eating here since they first opened (or took over from Kinara which served mediocre food). While we eat here once every month or so, we do end up with a couple of 'to-go's 1-2 times a month. I've probably tried about 10-15 entrees thus far, and while they were all very good, my personal favorites are the Keema Mattar and the Tandoori Chicken. And on top of that, the chef is more than willing to accommodate your requests, if what you feel like eating is not on the menu. I've frequently requested and gotten top-notch Onion Kulchas and my wife has gotten quite a few veggie dishes made for her.Service is excellent. Pricing is what it is for Orchard. One big issue i have is when you're eating on the patio, and the live band is playing next door, you sometimes have to put up with some loud, mediocre singing. Nothing that can't be tolerated
4
Stumbled on this restaurant on the way to Little India, had a fantastic meal. Service was lovely, owner (I think) came to double check on us when we ordered Vindaloo level 7 hot explained the spice level before sending order to kitchen (very thoughtful). 7 was just fine, slight sweat and runny nose without killing the taste buds. Fantastic veggie samosas light crunchy pastry. Saffron rice nicely spices not just yellow, chicken jalfrezi and garlic naan equally yummy. Only one regret, only 2 of us to share would of loved to try a few more dishes
3
I have to start by clarifying the title, it refers to the rating choices available from tripadvisor.A colleague of my wife was in town for a work conference and was in the mood for Indian and was staying close to Orchard Rd, so we though we'd check out Curry Culture after reading the reviews. Of the food, although we asked for some recommendations from our waiter not much was forthcoming, so we ordered drinks and mulled over the menu ourselves. We choose three dishes with rice and naan bread. The food itself was very nice although not as spicy as I would have liked as for the service although a bit lacking from some staff, others were very professional. The pricing is as I would expect on Orchard Road and overall we enjoyed the meal and atmosphere of the place. I normally would head to little India for what would be usually worse service but as good food, but I would eat here again
2
I went to visit Curry Culture again this May on my colleague's insistence but things had not changed much. The service is still slow & you get this feeling that everyone seems to take the cue from one person. No initiative & unresponsive. Food is also average. I've been to better Indian restaurants in Singapore 
4
There is no dearth of Indian restaurants in Singapore, but this one genuinely tries to be different. The concept of taster curries is a good thought as it allows you to have 2 curries for the price of marginally more than 1 full curry. Food is surely one of the best in Singapore and provides value for money. Another speciality is the cocktails done in Indian style. Service woes may be present during peak hour but such issues are being faced by most restaurants in Singapore due to shortage of skilled manpower. Already been there twice and this place is recommended
4
In amongst an area with many other restaurants all offering differing cuisines the Curry Culture is worth a visit. Very attentive staff and with a creative chef who will spice to your pallet hence the Vindaloo from 1 to 10. You can eat inside or more interestingly outside under cover. A buzzy place with lots to see going on all around you
4
We ate here as it was close to our hotel, but the food was good enough to travel for. Dishes were familiar but prepared with more flair than at a standard Indian restaurant. Service was attentive, but occasionally a little slow - not enough to stop a return visit though
4
Its about 3-4 months to have my weekdays lunch at "The Curry Culture". The team and Owner (Mr. Sandeep) is such as nice person and excellent host. Being a vegitarian in Singapore, i get rid of my all tention about to get Authentic Indian Vegitarian Food. I am thankful to Mr. Sandeep and team how nicely they treat their customer as family member. Best part here, you tell them your mood,and they suggest you food. Flexibility is another gem of this place. All the best Sandeep..Keep growing and expand to next levels....Sanjay Jai

I went to Curry Culture in Jan 2013 & after reading Sandeep's response, I decided to give it another shot. There have been some improvements to the service but most times it seems to b a one-man show. This time I tried a variety of tandoor, sweet & spicy dishes. Food is generally mediocre, despite trying the spicy Vindaloo curries. They should seriously cut down on the oil, especally since most people are more conscious about the oil. (This was my contention even in my previous review) . I've not given up on Indian food but like I said, ''One Bitten, Twice Shy''
5
Great to try out an Indian Restaurant which has truly preserved the authentic cuisine of India! Great work....keep it up! We'll be coming again, for sure!
5
We found this restaurant by glancing down a side street the boys were enticed by the two for one beers and I by the specials board promoting "lamb chops". The rest of the food didn't disappoint especially the must try tiger prawns stuffed with crab meat and marinated in tandoori to die for!!Highly recommend if you are looking for something on orchard road and happy to pay for good food. I just wished they made deliveries to Adelaide!
5
We went as a group of 5 to this restaurant and were very impressed. We eat a lot of Indian Indian food around the world and have to say this place doing disappoint. Service was excellentFood was first classWell done to a great curry house with friendly competent staf
5
We knew the area well so decided to try out the curry house because of the good reviews and it was so worth it! best curry i have had in a long time. we had a mixture of tikka masala, butter chicken, vindaloo, lamb bhuna, dhal etc and honestly couldn't fault any of it - every meal was delicious. have paid a lot more for average food in singapore. the food is good enough alone but the service was also incredible... really quick and attentive, made you feel looked after and comfortable.. the manager was nice enough to give us a complimentary sharing plate which was lovely and kept checking to make sure our meal was ok. really lovely man and restaurant; will be coming back again next time in singapore
5
My Singapore based friend was very skeptical when I suggested this place after finding them through Tripadvisor. When our two families walked in, the owner greeted us and I immediately warned him that he had several doubters in his midst and that he would have to work hard to save his reputation ( and mine and Tripadvisor in the process) and mollify my friend. Sandip( the Owner) enthusiastically took to the challenge. From his suggestion for the wine, to his recommended appetizers, the ice quickly thawed with the doubters and within 25 minutes of our arrival there, there were 6 converts to the Culture enthusiastically awaiting and applauding each dish!Well done my friend Sandip and may you convert all the non-believers in time
5
I love indian food. I love cooking indian and am happy to spend hours grinding spices and making my own pastes. At times my wife gets bored with everything curry but The Curry Culture proved that I am correct!I ordered the lamb bhuna (lamb in Singapore?) it is rare that a dish can open up so many happy memories. Loved it, wiped the bowl with my naan and licked it some more! Beautiful truly Indian food in a comfortable, relaxed setting.I'm not 100% sure whether I enjoyed the meal as much as our genial hosts enjoyed my reaction to their fantastic food.My recommendation? Order the lamb cutlets! As I sat feeling full, happy and smug the waiter walked by and the smell wafting behind him was straight from the pearly gates! I will be back. Didn't get the chance to see whether they were the tandoori cutlets or the masala. Maybe I will just order them both next time..
5
We were looking for a not-too-expensive meal around 8:00 and chose this one out of a myriad of others on Cuppage Rd, including another Indian restaurant. The food was excellent and the staff was friendly and attentive, even offering a complimentary mango/yoghurt drink. We ordered the Dal Makhani, Malai Chix Afghani, and plain rice which came to about US$32 including 10% service charge. We left with full bellies and a contented feeling on our last night in Singapore
5
This is an excellent Indian restaurant and very true to its name the curries here are delicious and totally Indian ... The manager here was very helpful... He helped us in telling the places and the correct prices of the attractions here in Singapore ... Nice guy.. Just on a bit expensive side but totally worth it it is in the heart of orchard road...totally satisfying..
5
We visited this restaurant shortly after it opened. The owner and his wife were most helpful. The food was authentic fresh and absolutely delicious. Lots of choice in the area but this was certainly a winner.
3
Had Chicken Tikka - just OK. Menu selection wasn't very appealing to me, Waiters had nothing to suggest or offer. Very passive service. The Cuppage Terrace is a nice dinning location and a 2 minuter walk from the Somerset MRT station. A fun option to eat dessert is Cold Stone on the corner of Orchard and Koek - 1 minute away
5
The restaurant owners and staff were very friendly and seemed to enjoy what they doing. They were very helpful in describing several items to my in-laws who don't eat Indian food very often and provided perfect suggestions. Additionally as another reviewer also commented, they allowed for us to order the level of spiciness. My wife and I found the food to be better than most of the Indian restaurants that we've been to in London. All four of us who have completely different tastes left completely satisfied and would recommend The Curry Culture to anyone looking for delicious Indian food
5
We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at this very nice resturant. Excellent service and fantastic food - the Vindaloo chicken was perfect -you can choose the spicyness your self from 1-10, I had a 6 and it was just superb
5
Though the menu is not very elaborate but covers the Indian Food [ North Indian ] to a large extent the staff is always eager to make a little changes as per your requirements and also serve something out of the menu if it is possible and normally they oblige .The restaurant has a bar but as it is a typical Indian Restaurant their put in more of their time and mind on serving good food rather than devote their time of Wines , they do serve Beer and other drinks but have limited choice.AS it is a sit out restaurant with outdoor and also AC indoors the price is a bit on the higher side but again the quality and freshness of food served takes care of the price part 
4
This restaurant came up recently in place on Kinara restaurant which was a favourite among the indians here, so this restaurant had to fill in big shoes. They have done it really well, infact they have gone bigger with more outdoor sitting area. The food is quite authentic & lives upto the expectations
4
This place on a little side street just off the busy and exclusive Orchard Road is not easy to find. Less than 100m into Cuppage Road, Cuppage Terrace forms an al fresco courtyard surrounded by historical facades. Here you cannot miss The Curry Culture. If want a change from the various Chinese food offerings and if you are into excellent Indian quality food, attentive and friendly staff in a relaxed atmosphere this is certainly a good choice
4
Our Host Sandeep ,( a true gentleman) provides a culinary delight at his establishment . It is easy to find from the MRT and the food is genuinely tasty 
5
I had a meal at 'Curry Culture' the night before last, and cannot recommend it highly enough. I realise that tastes differ, and that what for me is good will be for some people not so good.I was undecided on my choice, torn between two dishes. I was familiar with the vindaloo, and was keen to try it, but was also intrigued by the tiger prawn stuffed with crabmeat tandoori. That was not a problem to the manager, he suggested that I order small portions of both. Excellent food, very well prepared. The vindaloo's are rated on a spicy scale of 1 - 10. I was recommended the 3, and it was just right. Spicy enough to savour the flavour, but not enough to blow my head off.The prawn and crab was a very innovative dish, and recommended for anyone who enjoys seafood curries.The staff are exceptionly friendly, and very helpful. All told, a very good dining experience.My last night in Singapore, so I will be trotting along to 'Curry Culture' again, this evening
5
I was scoped out the lines of restaurants and when I scanned past the Curry Culture I knew this will be more expensive. The setting and decor was elegant plus they near Orchard road so Restuarant rent will be high. That expectation understood I chose them as a try. I am pleased to say I will be trying and trying again and again. I was very pleased with my meal. I had the Kathi chicken rolls. Surprise it was great tasting and presented elegantly. Then I had the Lamb Chops special for the day which is not on the menu. It costed more than avg meal but I gave it a chance. Surprise. It made me very happy. The thick gravy spices are elegant and leaves me with a happy feeling. You know you eating something specials. You won't get this in Little India. Dessert was the rice pudding (they used a different name, I call it Keer). Surprise finish to my meal as it was delicious. First time ever that I've had a 3-course meal. Curry Culture sets itself above your standard indian restaurants. Their prices are comparable to restaurant prices in the district. After reading some of their recent reviews, it seems some customers had isolated poor experiences. My suggestion is for you to engage the staff or managers if you not pleased. Do note that I did not get any up selling so its obvious that management heard and took steps to improve. Service can be tweaked but I will share my tips to management on my next visit. Yes definitely I will be back with my friends. Overall experience was great as I was expecting a typical indian eatery but when you try this place you will see the difference. I also noticed guests who come there frequently which is a sign of a good restaurant. Also the food comes at same time for all at table. This is unlike in standards in some orchard restaurants where the food comes when it comes and not timed correctly. Main meals range from S$14-$25. My lamb chops special was $28 which is comparable to the other good lamb chop dishes in orchard. You can read the restaurant by taxi as its behind centre point mall. You easily get off at somerset station and take a very short walk. And their menu is not packed with 500 choices. They have their best dishes as a more focussed service to customers is possible. I was surprised to see the vindaloo in multiple heat options as vindaloo can be dynamite. Next time I can enjoy this dish that scared me in the past.
5
Really pleased with the choice of delicious vegetarian food on offer at this restaurant. The menu is well presented and easy to read, the presentation of the dishes is really appealing and the food was delicious. I particularly enjoyed the Onion Bhaji as an appetiser, and the Dahi Baingan (mashed aubergine with yoghurt) as a main. The service is also really good - very professional and friendly. We loved the al fresco dining experience - the area is brightly lit and cooled by fans, making it a pleasant place to enjoy a great meal. Look forward to our next visit
5
Extremely tasty food, nice and friendly staff. We wouldn't have expected more!!! We visited from Jan 11-16 and our search for good food ended with this restaurant. I was amazed to find that the food was even tastier than some of best five star Restaurant in India. Would recommend all our family and friends to visit this place during their visit. We can only say that apart from serving good food they are doing social service for our Indian
5
We are drawn to Indian restaurants wherever we go, and we were delighted to discover Curry Culture. When we arrived at 7:30 pm on a Friday, there were tables available both inside and outside. The table for two people that was inside was located right under a cold air vent, so we sat at a table for four outside. There was a nice breeze, possibly from the ceiling fans. We shared a butter chicken and two cheese naan. They gave us free water, papardam and tamarind, mint, and tomato chutney. The butter chicken curry was delicious with many choice pieces of succulent tandoori chicken in a tasty sauce. We also enjoyed the unique cheddar cheese taste of the cheese naan. The manager asked how we liked the food and how they could improve our experience. They were showing a Bollywood movie on a large screen outside screen in the outdoor area. The price was very competitive for the location, quality of food and service. The staff said goodbye to us when we left. We felt content, with the still-fresh memory of the lovely taste of the meal and the courtesy and attention of the staff. We recommend Curry Culture very highly
5
All round a fabulous tastey meal. The dishes were unique and all tatsted very different. The friendly manager reccommended the most marvelous 'typical Indian dishes' to our meal which were sensational. The meal was like having a party in my mouth
4
My husband and I visited this restaurant whilst on our honeymoon and had a thoroughly enjoyable meal - the staff were attentive, friendly and we didn't find them pushy at all.The food was excellent, and we didn't have to wait long at all. Really not sure where these bad reviews have come from, doesn't sound like the same restuarant we visited, definitely worth a visit
1
Went for dinner with my colleague last week and this is another run-of-the-mill curry garbage at its best... the only differentiation (as observed by the other diners here) is the irritating upselling and the slow service ! I have been to the Maharajah a couple of shops away so many times in the past, and I like them better for their sincere/original curries and a not-so-hyped environment !!
2
Curry Culture is just a place that has been so hyped up in Trip Advisor. I found the food just average. The worst is they try to up-sell, which gets really irritating.It wasn't really crowded but it took a great 45 minutes to get our mains. Would have appreciated better service for food that is basically average
1
I came to Singapore in late December 2012 & decided to go for Indian with my colleagues - My first Indian meal in Singapore. There is better Indian food in Durban, Swaziland & South Africa. I was quite shocked with the quality - mostly sweet, not spicy & too much of oil. I brought it to the attention of one of the waiters & they claimed that there must be oil in Indian food - what rubbish! I got the feeling that people here pay for the restaurant decor & the rental prices. Quite ridiculous! I was told that Singapore is known as a Food Paradise. Should I go Indian again or try another cuisine
4
Food for us was excellent, great curries and condiments. Attempts to continually up sell though got on my nerves, I think we spent $20 in the end on bottles of water. I might be wrong but u kind of felt they were just refilled bottles from tap water anyway. Would be back for the food but would watch that I was only ordering what I really wanted.
5
Friendly staff, amazing flavours, variable heat and spice levels. Awesome atmosphere at night with large outdoor covered area with fans. Alcohol prices very reasonable compared to other restaurants in singapore. Overall great casual dining experience in the perfect location for visitors to Singapore as well as locals. Sandeep ( the owner ) extremely welcoming and will personally ensure you are comfortable and satisfied
5
We tried a starter that the proprietor recommended - potato on a savoury pasty base covered in what looked like yoghurt which was sensationally delicious! An amazing fusion of tastes that for me was sublime!! In fact everything we had was very tasty - easily the best curry I have eaten anywhere for a long time. And we are used to some of the best UK curry restaurants. Highly recommended! Prices were reasonable by Singapore standards where unfortunately we have paid a fortune for what can only be described as mediocre food
5
We went here based on the TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed. Generally, I avoid Indian Restaurants in the UK as too many of them are very generic offering often greasy 'sauces' poured over cooked meat.This restaurant was much, much better - excellent quality dishes which are clearly cooked to order and with really genuine, friendly service that you can clearly see comes with an interest and passion for the food.Recommended

We were in singapore for 2 days and craving indian food. Discovered Curry Culture from tripadvisor and we went for dinner on Monday night around 7pm, started to get busy around 7:30 so would book to avoid disappointment. Central location just off Orchard Road which is very good.To our surprise Sandeep (the ownder) informed us the food is halal but under singaporean law they cannot advertise this as they serve alcoholic beverages. For starters we had mixed tandoori platter, the chicken tikka was succulent and delicious, prawns and fish well seasoned, seekh kebabs were good also. For mains the star was the bhuna ghosht - lovely and tender pieces of meat with a thick gravy that had a punch of tomato, lemon and spices all in the right proportion - very very good. Second dish of eggplant was nice with a good all round texture and nutty flavour - not greasy at all which is refreshing. We've eaten at some of the very best indian restaurants in london (including the michelin starred Benares) and this bhuna ghosht is certainly as good as we've experienced elsewhere... The Naan bread was crisp and fresh, garlic naan was very well executed with not too much garlic. The concoction of April Lady (mangoes&mint&coconut) was refreshing and cleansing. The ONLY small let down was the papadoms which were a touch damp but given the humidity we can excuse it... Otherwise we would have given 5 stars...Overall good value for money at SGD 30-40 per person for starters and mains. Sandeep and his wife were wonderful in making us feel relaxed and paid very good attention to our needs but weren't overly fussy which can happend in recently opened restaurants. Given the Indian restaurant business has been in my family for almost 50yrs I like to think I know a bit about this type of cuisine... Curry Culture is definitely one to watch out for as a rising star in singapore... Expect the good reviews to keep flooding in

The curries were absolutely delicious but that is only part of the story, the real USP of this restaurant are the staff who were so welcoming, friendly and helpful throughout the evening. If you like curry and prefer restaurant that have a friendly feel (not overly serious) this is the place for you

We dropped by The Curry Culture last night.(it was our first visit there)We sat outside, the ambience was quite good with old bollywood songs playing on the TV.The Amritsari Machhli was absolutely yummy as was the chicken tikka. The main course arrived 45-50mins after we placed our order. I thought that our waiter had forgotten to inform the kitchen staff about it as he had disappeared into thin air after taking our order! But when it finally arrived, the Prawn Malabar Masala, Palak Kumbh Makai curry alongwith the lacchha parathas and the tandoori rotis were simply gr8.I would love to go again, provided the service improves!!

Outstanding food, service a bit slow which resulted in Luke warm food. The owner quickly replaced a couple of our dishes with hot ones and provided free dessert. Would absolutely return.

A very good atmosphere for gathering with friends.We enjoyed very much for the tandoori platter which served with a hot plate. Good ideas for keeping the food warm!Choices of sitting in the restaurant with nice decor and painting. But we choose to sit outdoor caused can enjoy the big screen of the Bollywood dance with the great food at the same times!The service here was fantastic too! Overall we enjoy very much

Brought a relatively large number of business guests including overseas visitors to TCC for dinner. The service was excellent, food delicious and price reasonable. Food was served promptly and service was polite and discreet. Attention paid to details. Location great for visitors, given proximity to Orchard road. We all sat outside which was very pleasant. Overall highly recommend

I was dining alone and wanted Indian food since there is no good Indian food at home. I found Curry Culture via TripAdvisor and walked the one mile down Orchard Road from my hotel - enjoying the holiday decorations and urban vibrancy - to Cuppage Terrace.Sandeep, Jimmy, and their pleasant team immediately made me feel welcome and offered recommendations,as well as offering to single-portion (with commensurate price adjustment) an entree and a curry so that I could enjoy both without wasting food and paying too much.I started with the Papdi Chaat which is six delightful two-bite crisps with chickpeas and yogurt and several other flavors that blended well - it was sort of an Indian Nacho. For the main course I had the crab stuffed prawn and the Vindaloo Curry (which can be ordered at a heat level of one to ten - I chose for four which was fine for me). Rounded out with Basmati Rice, Butter Naan, and two pints of Tiger Draft Beer. Everything worked well together, none of the flavors were overpowering, the chicken and prawn were perfectly tender, and the portions were perfect (single-sized).I sat outside on the deck which was pleasant under the fans, and enjoyed live music from the venue next door. If I had another free evening I would happily return, but I do look forward to returning on my next visit to Singapore

Liked the ambience of the outdoor seating. Good and attentive service. The food tasted fresh and tasty. Not oily at all. Just wished the service staff would not stomp on the cockroaches roaming between patio areas on the surrounding restaurants.

On the whole one of the best Indian meals I have had in Singapore

Curry Culture is excellent. I had a custom (wasn't on the menu) made shrimp korma dish and cheese nan. The service is top notch, in fact I shared a very delightful conversation with most of the staff. The restaurant is clean and in a great location (just off of Orchard Rd) and a two minute walk to the Holiday Inn Parkview

We went to this restaurant on Diwali and had a great time over lunch. Our waiter took the time to explain all the dishes we were interested in and was keen to know what we thought. To start, we had the tiger prawns stuffed with crabmeat, which were unlike anything I've ever had before and really delicious, if a tad expensive. If you like seafood, these are definitely worth a try.

Everything was perfect. We were not disappointed in anyway. We asked for recommendations from our waiter, and he delivered. The lamb and curry dishes were outstanding. The dinners were well worth the money

Great food. Excellent service. Brinjal dish is exquisite. Highly recommended.No Puris for dinner was a bit of disappointment. Bollywood movie juke box would be an interesting addition to an already good locale

Nestled a inches off Orchard road, this delightful restaurant serves the best Indian food in Singapore. Firstly, the decor is just right, casual, modern with some traditional Indian flavors thrown in. Just right for that business lunch, the hangover brunch, dinner with family or the evening out with friends Alcohol: Always a fan of restaurants who put in that extra effort in their cocktails. Sandeep and team have done a fantastic job infusing Indian twists into cocktails. Whats better, he signaled there may be more to come :)The food: Like I said, the best Indian food in Singapore. Unlike most Indian restaurants in Singapore which go down the fusion route and pretty much take away the core flavors from the dish, Curry culture has been true to its roots. Kept it simple, play with the spices, but dont tamper with the crux of the recipe. The black gram patty (kaale channe ka tikka) melted in the mouth, just like the tikkas in Old Delhi or the ragda in Mumbai. The chicken tikka, was marinated and cooked just right to give the tender, yet not overpowered with spices taste. The highlight for me was the Vindaloo, where they have a spice rating from 1-10 (10 being the hottest). Reminded me of some crazy pig out sessions in GoaHighly recommended, for one and all

Being Indian I am sometimes very critical of Indian restaurants anywhere in the world. I live in the UK but was in Singapore at the start of October 12. The food was excellent. It tasted just like home made cooking to us. Well cooked and lovely presentation. We has great pleasure in speaking to the owners Mr and Mrs Sachar. They were very attentive to all their guests and provided individual attention to all their guests. The setting and decor of the restaurant set a relaxing ambience. It is a restaurant I would definitely revisit and recommend to anyone whilst they are in Singapore. Thank you for two very enjoyable evenings

We found this new curry house by accident whilst looking for the Starhub store. It seemed like it had recently opened. The staff were extra attentive, the curriest were very good (I had fish head curry which was new for me) and prices were OK. Nice location too
