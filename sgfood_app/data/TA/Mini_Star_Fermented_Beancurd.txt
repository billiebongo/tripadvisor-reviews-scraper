Here is the only place you can find fermented beancurd in Singapore. Been visited this small restaurant since year 2005, their fermented beancurd still delicious as before. S$4 per plate have 2 pieces together with their Chinese sauerkraut (S$2.50 if you want to add on more) and sweet & chili sources. They also have Spicy claypot fermented beancurd, but I preferred the original taste. In their menu, you can find many HongKong foods too, example CheZai Mian (Cart Noodles) and HongKong desserts(Don't try their steam egg, waste your money)

This seems to be the only place in Singapore that sells stinky tofu. Will always come here whenever I've got my cravings. The crispy fried intestine is good too @$4 per portion. Stinky tofu is 2 pcs for $4. Parking maybe a problem as it's situated along geylang area and it's parallel parking. You can order via phone and inform them the pick up time. The pungent is not really that strong as compared to places like taiwan and Hong Kong. The sauce is also different.

This had been my usual place to go for a quick fix of smelly beancurd. Will either take away or dine in but strongly recommend to dine in because of the smell.Other than the smelly beancurd, recommend to try dishes include deep fried intestines which is rare especially the removal of the smell. The Hong Kong noodle is also another must try.For takeaway, you can even call to pre order and collect it later. Try it if u want to experience authentic smelly beancurd

Chanced upon this place whilst walking along Geylang road and decided to try the place out as it looked quaint and served stinky-fermented bean curd. Tried to fried toufu which cost $4 for 2 pieces , it came out piping hot and crispy and tasted really good with the chili sauce. try the fried pigs intestines as its also quite interesting in flavor. If you are around the vicinity its worth a visit just to have a taste of fermented bean curd in Singapore
