They put down side dish without notify us whether it is free or have to pay, they directly counted in our bill which i feeling not comfortable.
5
This was my second visit to this restaurant for dinner. Liked the food very much. Will definitely go back again.
4
Have not visited Shin Yeh for quite a long time. I do think that Or Nee’s standard have dropped. Overall of the food is still quite good.

A restaurant where one can expect good Taiwanese food. We ordered pig's liver, toufu and chye poh omelette to go along with porridge.
4
Food is excellent. Current buffet promotion is great value for money. Service is excellent too! The liver is best!
5
Love the food, atmosphere and service. Thank you for a great experience, will definitely be going back there again :)

I am a regular at this restaurant. During my recent visit, I felt their popular radish egg omelette has lacked the taste and fragrance which I used to enjoy. Perhaps a change in the kitchen chef or..??They are grossly understaffed during peak hours, it takes some effort to be able to 'secure' someone to take down food orders. Billing also takes time and I often prefer to directly pay at the cashier desk near the entrance

Shin yeh is suitable for family gathering. Food is good. I highly recommend the pork liver which is cooked to the right texture and temperature. Well-done Chef !!!! Another dish I would recommend will be brinjal minced meat. Overall, a pleasant experience though waiter and waitress were overwhelmed and service might be a bit slower during peak timing
5
Went for their dinner buffet to celebrate birthday. Although we are enjoying the 4 for the price of 3 promotion, the service staffs are still super friendly & attentive, which I find very rare in Singapore restaurants especially Chinese restaurants. Furthermore, they even prepare a very extravagant & yummy longevity buns dish for the birthday celebration on the house. With the quality, value for money food & wonderful service, will definitely visit more often.

Excellent service and great food at Shin Yeh. The service officers and managers who attended to us are super friendly, courteous and well mannered. They are very patient in introducing their menu items to us. Give good advice and suggestions so that we will not waste the food and money of course. No hard selling. Very attentive staff

Great place to go for families with kids. The food quality is good. However, it is quite challenging to get the attention of the service staff in the restaurant.
4
Food was good and authentic. Prices was a bit on the high side.
Service was good esp waitress Annie who was genuinely helpful.
4
The food was fast and good, waitress kept refilling our tea. But aircon was really cold, do wear warmer if you come here. Was pretty prompt in service.
5
Shin Yeh staff were patient and friendly, and the ambience is excellent. Homey dishes were well made and good comfort food to the familiar :)
4
Was there for my mummy’s birthday & we enjoy the food very much. Service are good and they even presented the cake on a very nice plate.
2
Poor service standards for a supposedly Tunglok outlet. There was once service auntie whose table service manners was more suited for a kopitiam tzi-char stall. Food - quality has dropped to ordinary, portion sizes too small. Won't return again.
4
Celebrated friend's birthday. Nice ambience & good food! Love the salted egg fish skin!! Would visit again!
4
Ordered the 3 cup chicken, spinach, fried silver fish, seafood fried Mee Suan, and soup. Can't remember the name of the soup, but there is abalone in it. Food was all good. Was especially Glad that it was not salty even though I did not ask for less salt this time, just in case, friends find the food too bland. So, all in all, a good dining experience.

Had a colleague from out of town wanting dim sum so we headed to the nearest place to our office at Clarke Quay.We were surprised and somewhat disappointed to learn on arrival that about half (or just under half) the dim sum menu were not available. We made our booking for 1230pm so it was strange that so many items weren't avaliable by the time we arrived.Nevertheless we went ahead and ordered the available items, which included a steamed sponge cake (literally called Malay Cake), steamed spare ribs, glutinous rice, custard buns, BBQ pork buns, egg tarts and my UK colleague settled for a beef fried noodles

If you intend to try 2 cuisine under one roof, you can choose to dine at Shin Yeh. It is under Tung Lok Group. Taiwan food: 1)Mullet roe (serve with turnip, leek and black bean), if the mullet roe slice can be thicker will be better, otherwise the leek is over powering2) Pan fried turnip cake (actually in hokkien call "Chai Po Neng"), inside the egg is moist and surprisingly not too salty3) Sauteed fresh oyster with scallion and garlic (served on hot plate), the portion is very generous and the doneness of the oyster is perfect (still juicy)4) Claim soup with chicken, the soup is tasteless 5) Taiwan style rice with soya sauce lean pork (with pickle vegetable and half lava egg), the rice is short and fat, combine all the ingredient and eat, taste good They do have a-la-carte buffet (minimum 4 to dine), value for money. You can try quite variety of food.
3
Spacious and comfortable setting, very ideal for family with kids and old folks. Quality of food was acceptable but nothing impressive that deserve compliment. Service was prompt and staff were friendly.
5
Good service and excellent food..recommended place for families.
Must try the liver dish. All-time favourite!
5
Great food, great service. In general is a bit pricy but is totally worth it, will definitely come back again.
5
The food is generally nice. The roasted chicken is tender and nice. Overall, it is a good dining experience.
3
Good Taiwanese cuisine though my friends say it's even better in Taiwan. The ambience was nice and the food quite good. But prices may be a bit steep
3
Good test of Taiwanese cuisine in a restaurant with a view. The food was good and prices reasonable.
4
One of the better one Vs Oasis for sweet potato porridge. Only thing is, food quality n service is better here.Unfortunately, I did not take the many pictures of dishes ordered. Pig trotters dish was good. Vegetables were delicious. Fried oysters, is pretty good as always, minced meat with salted egg awesome to go with porridge.Been dinning here for many years. Glad to say, nothing changed as it's still just as good.
3
You can get rice porridge with sweet potatoes to accompany your meal with othe Taiwainese dishes...egg with chai-po, or oysters, pork knuckles with peanuts, marinated beef tendon amongst others. The taste of the food for me is average. No wow factor! Some dishes were bland, mustard heart with dried scallops! For a change of variety I would come again! Tim Sum also available
3
Authentic? Not anymore. Food is a disappointment especially the 3 Cups Chicken. Frozen chicken was used and the meat was chopped so huge, the sauce did not penetrate into the meat. Not flavorful. Asked to send back to the kitchen to redo. Fish mall soup was tasteless. Veg with mushroom was the best dish of our dinner. Pig intestine just right, no offal smell. Love the complimentary dessert of the nite from the manager. Mr Tommy. Well done. Attentive & look into our feedback on our dinner. May be back again.
3
The food here is passable and prices are not too bad, except for the tea, which costs $12 a pot. Not so bad if there are 4 to 6 people to share a pot, but not if there are only 2 diners. The restaurant should consider charging for tea on a per head basis but regardless of the number of people sharing, $12 for a pot of common tea is way too excessive. It makes one feel ripped off

This restaurant is operated under the Tung Lok Group and for us, it's sometimes a hit and miss.
We were there for Sunday lunch. The service was good, no doubt about that.
Our favorites were the pan fried liver and the stewed luffa.
4
Had a quiet yum cha lunch here today. Nice dumplings, tea was a bit ordinary, service good. It's relatively inexpensive for a sit down, table service place. Liang Court is a pretty sad mall but it dies have some hidden treasures.
5
Group of 3 of us went for lunch. Found the menu to have plenty of variety. All the dishes were fresh and very nice. Service was great. Will definitely be back. Thanks
4
The restaurant is very nice, conveniently located at Liang Court, just beside Clarke Quai.
A different taste I didn't try before, I highly recommend to try the Taiwan beer too, it is light and matches with the food.

16/March/2017 - 7 of us at 6.30pm's sitting.The dishes we had came delicately tasteful - not overtly salty and ever gentle on the taste buds. With the unfortunate exception of the iconic chye poh egg... which came rather bland, plain ... and therefore, underperformed. As did too, the dessert we had, the flour mochi-like ball coated with peanut - failed us. It was drastically short on grated peanuts. It ended up tasting like a tasteless goey mess.Ugh!The Braised Pork with Peanuts, The Stewed Belly Pork, Sweet Potato Porridge, Tanghoon Prawn, Red Date Spare Ribs, Chicken Dish, Tofu platter, and sweet plum drink that came grandly chilled - was heartening.Service was generally acceptable. What was shockingly discomforting was this - after we were seated, a slim guy in a suit suddenly came behind my seat and barked asking what tea we wanted. A delicate approach, one preferably graced with finesse .... and definitely more welcoming and cheerful would have done wonders for us

This Tiwanese restaurant is well presented and you are greeted by pleasant and efficent staff.We ordered a reasonable cross range of dim sum items complimented by green tea.The dishes were forth coming in a reasonaable staggered time.Every sample to say the least was nothing short of excellent being the result of there flavours and freshness Definately worth trying the Dim Su

I had been to Shin Yeh restaurants in Taipei many times and also a few times the local Tung Lok's franchise. Regret to say the standards differ quite significantly, in fact, a bit worsen compared to the last time I visited. We were a party of 4 people and ordered the "san bei ji", xinjiu fried beehoon, chef's recommendation shredded tofu, fried chilli sweet potato leaves, gua bao, clamp soup, fried oyster omelette. The oyster omelette was the best of all. The rest of the dishes was a disappointment. The "san bei ji" was not sizzling hot but in a cool earthen pot which we had to return for further cooking! The gau bao was modified from before and is no more wrapped but just sandwiched and minus the peanut. The sweet potato leaves was fried with a pool of chilli oil. The shredded tofu was tasteless and surprisingly is listed as chef recommendation. We left with more than half the plate. However, the restaurant is big and spacious and settings is quite luxurious which we enjoyed the place. Regrettably not the food

Our party of 8 arrived, 7 of us are Australian and 1 being a Chinese Malaysian. The decor was fine and most of our party wanted to order the Roasted duck as it was a speciality. We ordered 10 dishes at 7pm.The first (fried rice) arrived within 15 minutes....then the problems started. The next 2 dishes were not what we ordered. After a further 30 minutes a couple of the correct dishes arrived. My girlfriend who speaks fluent Chinese went to ask them what the delay was. The answer was, wait it will be arriving soon...without any apology given.An hour after we sat down one more dish appeared..still no duck.After an hour and a half we decided to leave... we cancelled the undelivered meals...the bill arrived with lightning speed.Not surprisingly it was wrong. After the third attempt we got the right bill with the undelivered items removed.I would advise no one to eat here and we will never be back

Liang Court is more famous for its Japanese food but my wife and I decided to try something different for a change and a change it was! We ordered a pot of chrysanthemum tea for 2 and we were charged $12. If it was some specialty tea I can understand but it was just a teabag! We ordered a noodle dish with pork. It came with noodle all right but you need a microscope to see the pork! It spoilt our dinner

The family has been enamored with Taiwanese food since our visits to Taiwan last year. With the rain today we just felt like some comfort food and thought "ah-ha" what about Taiwanese food? Quick Google search later we found Shin Yeh. Located at Liang Court it has a nice ambience. Menu was balanced with typical Taiwanese fare. We had the mee sua, the tofu, intestines, oyster omlette and venison. All well executed and arrived promptly. Staff were attentive and we'll versed with the food. Definitely a place to return again and again. Not only on a rainy day.

Slightly pricey. Good service. Good food. Our usual orders are the claypot abalone mushroom and stewed pork trotters.
4
Online reservations were a breeze. Managed to confirm menu. The ambience is nice, quality of food very good. Surprised at the larger than usual portions. Service was excellent.
4
nice restaurant, menu with good variety of dishes. Ordered the crispy fried bull frog and some vegetables. They all were fantastic.! A recommended good taiwanese restaurant.
3
This taiwanese restaurant shin yeh can be found on the first floor. Good food and good services provide. Friendly staff and well trained. No complain on the food and that is the reason why I keep coming back. Keep up the good work

Had dinner at Shin Yeh restaurant with families and friends. Basically most of their dishes were very good.
Nice ambiance and the price is on the high side.

Found this little gem while strolling through Liang Court. The dim sim is delicious but only served at lunch time so make sure you visit then for the whole selection. We've been back a few times as we love it so much!The staff are very friendly and always willing to help

Located in the mall nearby the Novotel hotel, this is a great place to sample and appreciate the Taiwanese cuisine.The service was very good, courteous and efficient.The a la carte menu is full of delicacies from seafood to meat, dim sum, rice, noodles etcGood beer on tap (Tiger) chilled and tasty.A great experience to renew, and at a reasonable price: circa 100S$ for 2.Well done Shin Yeh
4
It's our family's first time and it won't be our last. Good variety of food, ranging from appetizers, main dishes to desserts from the ala carte menu.Like the fried pork belly, braised pig intestine and stir fried pig liver, pumpkin infused stir fried beehoon, fried rice and omelette with radish. The service was good too. Will try more dishes next time

Our 3G family has dined at this excellent Chinese Taiwanese Restaurant at L2 of River Valley's Liang Court Hotel which also houses Japan's top-notch Meidi-ya Supermart at B1 known as Japan's Imperial family grocery chain.Shin Yeh is spacious, clean and beautifully furnished. Service is professional, personal and fit as a world class restaurant and gourmet dishes including a few selective vegetarian delicacies like redbean pancakes etc.,could only be the painstaking creations of top chefs, though the hot floral tea is not equally wonderful ..

I had taken my family there once before and really enjoyed the food and service. I took some out of town guests last week and had a very different experience. Food was still great but not always brought to us hot. Service was pretty lousy. Three times we had dishes brought to us we did not order and waited 20-30 minutes for dishes we did order. They didn't seem overly bothered when I complained. One great experience, one time just ok. Will try one more time, then won't bother. Din Tai Feng is too close and too good every time to risk it
