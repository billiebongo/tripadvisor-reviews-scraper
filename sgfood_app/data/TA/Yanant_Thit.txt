It is a Burmese restaurant mostly crowded with Burmeses customers during lunch and dinner. Foods are delicious but portions are small for the price they charge.

We found this great little restaurant, across the road and downstairs from our hotel. What we ordered was not available (sold out), so we asked them to serve us something they still had. I'm still not sure what it was, but it was very delicious, hot and served quickly. Accompanied by a beer, it was just exactly what we needed after a long flight. The fact it was the busiest restaurant in the complex told us the food would be fresh and good. And it was. Recommended
