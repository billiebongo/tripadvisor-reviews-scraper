You have to love their handmade noodles with minced pork soup, my favourite! Only 7$. And definitely try the pan-fried dumplings, 6pcs for 6$.

I loved the noodles but they got rid of their famous soya bean milk recently... Shame. A few years ago, I was a regular until I moved away but their soya bean milk was always the highlight of my day.

I am Taiwanese food lover. Beside the point there are lots of Taiwan food in Singapore and not easy to find something to your likeness.Until my friend brought me here. The price were reasonable and the food were nice and tasty. Surprising it was nice and quiet as it was along the walkway. The sour plum drink was nice.Will be back again with my kids
