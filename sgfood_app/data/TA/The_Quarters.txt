Loved the foie gras wagyu don - the foie was rich and creamy while the beef was nicely charred and tender. will come back!
5
Good environment, good food but a little expensive. Cozy and quiet with great service from the waiter.
4
Friendly staff
Quick service
Relaxing ambience
Nice adaptation of the East & West
Will consider going again especially if we don't want somewhere fancy
3
Attended at the Quarters in the evening as a casual Friday Night out - interesting modern take on classic Singaporean dishes! Highly recommend the Fwah - Foie Gras with scrambled eggs and toast with kaya!
5
The staff whom served us was very friendly and nice. Food was simple yet not expensive. From the price that we paid for 2 steaks, it was very worth it!
4
Suitable to hold friends’ or family gathering. Friendly service received and wouldn’t mind going back again.
3
Restaurant with a small fusion menu. Food was so-so and it can be hard to attract the attention of the service staff as it was a busy night.
4
Food was nice and the service was good. Do note that the dinner menu comprising the char grill stuff only commences from 6pm.
5
We ordered beef and vegetables, which were grilled to almost perfection. The desserts were unique and made with food we wouldn't have thought possible for dessert. Indeed a place where food is made with love by people who love food and wanted to share with others
4
Interesting local-western fusion, I love how the traditional way of eating satay is deconstructed into rice patties sandwiching grilled chicken with satay sauce on the side.The Salted Egg Fried Chicken burger is not bad too, though I found the sauce a bit salty. The Waffle looks like Belgian style but it's still very much local style that's more crisp then chewy. Service is excellent, friendly and warm. Good value for money!
3
Staff called earlier to confirm reservations and made arrangements accordingly to fit in the need for accessibility... kudos to this and prompt clearing of plates.
However, the food was very salty which is unusual. Tried lunch set with them and it was good
3
Good Value for money with good play on sauces. No major negatives about this. And they do try hard to ensure customer satisfation.
4
loved the freshly fried chicken thigh. and there was enough salted egg yolk sauce too. much better than the macdonalds version haha
4
Excellent food, we had asparagus, beef ( the cheaper one which was delicious) and chilli crab pasta. All fabulous.
4
Went to try out their pastas and salted egg charcoal burger! Really yummy, with a cosy atmosphere! Will be back when there are promos!
5
Owner is very passionate about his food. Very friendly staff. Do try the Wagyu rice bowl, shiok fries and durian Crème brulee
4
Will be back again to try other items on their menu
P/S: #DurianCanBoleh aka Mao Shan Wang creme brulee is a must try on their menu!
4
The restaurant specialises in local fusion food. Typical cafe prices but good service. I still prefer traditional local food.
3
The service staff were really accommodating and lovely. Kudos to them for providing a great dining experience. Food was alright and reasonably priced. The highlight of our meal was the salted egg yolk burger - succulent chicken patty crusted with a crunchy exterior. There was a one for one deal, so it was really great value for money
5
The Quarters did not disappoint with its reinvention of the Nasi Lemak Burger which is all the craze in Singapore of late. The rice bun was the highlight with its chewy texture and the shredded cucumber strips was an interesting take on the cucumber slices that would typically go with Nasi Lemak. Great job
1
Had the salted egg yolk chicken burger again this time and it clearly didn't disappoint. The Quarters execute the asian fusion foods really well and each fusion dish is worth a try! The durian Creme brûlée is a must try too!
4
Went there with the promotion of a free salted egg burger. Thumbs up for the burger! The owner was very friendy as well.
4
I had an enjoyable dinner with my friend at the Quarters. The Real McCoyr was a little bit dry for me, my friend said her Ooh La La pasta was nice though. For dessert, Duriancanboleh was really nice, worth trying!
5
Great food & service. Thoroughly enjoyed the Mccoy burger and chilli crab pasta. The Buah keluak ice cream was refreshing and interesting. It's a fushion kinda place..
4
Great service and atmosphere, definitely a hidden gem in the Tiong Bharu enclave. Unfortunately, the steak was overcooked and tough.
4
Went during lunch hour during a weekday and it was pretty. Food was alright and service was great! :)
4
Food was pretty standard and good (salted egg burger and carbonara). Portion is also filling for a guy and especially at the price point. Probably the only issue was trying to locate the restaurant - was at quite a secluded corner.
5
The food here is really interesting! A good mix of local and western. We had the salted egg yolk burger which was amazing! The sauce was really good! The satay burger was alright. The chicken was not tender enough, the rice buns were abit too hard to our liking and the sauce was insufficient. However, the service was very good. Gave us more sauce when we requested. The fries were the highlight. It was awesome. Worth every calories. We will be back to try the rest of the menu!
2
This is the second time I visit the cafe,I love their salted egg burger when I first time came.but when I visit the second time ,the salad egg sauce is very very little, I asked the staff, the staff told me last time they are giving a lot salted egg sauce,now they have to charge additional $2 for the salted egg sauce.what kind of quality is this serviceable food 
3
Had a free salted egg burger with promo code applied. The chicken patty was too oily for our liking. Also had the chilli crab pasta and durian creme brulee. Both were not bad but the creme brulee was a little pricey at $8.50 for a small portion. It was good value with the free burger included
4
Crowd was sparse on a Sunday hence food arrived shortly after. Particulary liked the salted egg burger with its generous portions but the beef rendang could do with more meat in it!
4
The staff was very kind. Food was really good and price affordable. Will go back again to try out the other dishes.
5
Unique and tasty salted egg burger!
We also loved the chili crab pasta.
Great fusion between Singapore food and Western food.
Would definitely come back again!
3
The food is just ok. Chili crab pasta was average. Maybe the desserts are good but we did not try. The place seems to be famous for their durian desserts. Service is not bad.
4
Service was good, the staff was very prompt in giving recommendation. However, there are hits and misses in terms of the food.
4
Quite good deal they have with chope now, essentially a one for one! Huge burgers that can be shared by two, pasta was average though
5
Great Singaporean fusion foods with off-the-menu spirits and drinks! Friendly staff as well.
The salted egg burger (real McCoy) is a must try. And if you book them on Chope in July, you'll get it free!
5
I had the Chilli crab pasta and salted egg sauce burger. The salted egg sauce was generous and really good, chilli crab sauce is spicy enough
3
1. Ma Jie Indulgence was clearly a delight on its own, with the generous amount of crab meat.2. Salted Egg Yolk burger was just so-so. The chicken was just too hard to bite and the the salted egg yolk sauce is lack of salted egg yolk flavour.3. The service was really not up to standard. The owner was rude and unfriendly, leaving a really bad impression for first-timers like us.4. When I was about to sit down, I spotted my table was not clean and I need to ask the waiter to wipe it before I requested for the menu.Of notable mention on this dining experience is just the Ma Jie Indulgence. I would think a lot of improvements are really needed to boost the business and to attract recurring customers
2
Food was really overrated. Not as what we had seen on the online reviews. Won't think of visiting again.
5
Local cuisine like salted egg chicken, chilli crab pasta are served here! Fusion between local food and western :) Overall a nice experience.
4
Venue is conducive for gatherings - we can hear ourselves without shouting across table. Food is unique and interesting.
4
Went with 10 friends. Place was good for large groups. The chicken on the chicken salad was terrible. Chili crab pasta was not bad, but some found it too spicy. The best dish was by far the salted egg yolk chicken burger.
4
Staff were very polite and food was good! Would recommend coming back again with my other friends!! Please try their signature burger.
3
Had the chicken burger with egg yolk sauce. Found it just average. Couldn't really taste the egg yolk taste. Good service staff though. Wasn't that crowded so still an ok place to have a meal if u want some privacy while talking.
4
Had the 1 for 1 Burger Promo. Burger was good! Would have been better if there was a bigger serving of fries, and if choice of burger was available (instead of being limited to The Real McCoy).
5
Excellent food! We had the one for one burger. The chicken was very well marinated. Carbonara was nice too. Too many fries for the fish and chips though. Service was excellent! Very friendly staff. Very thankful for free flow of water.
4
I ordered the satay burger, as the shiok burger (pork patty) is unavailable. Surprisingly the satay burger is good, though the satay sauce is too thick for dipping. I also ordered calamari for starter, but was given baby squid instead. It was a total disappointment for the price we paid.
5
Their The Real McCoy - a salted egg yolk chicken burger is a must try! Generous portion, well balanced flavours and a party for the taste buds. Coupled with very friendly service, this cafe is a great way to taste Singapore's specialty flavours in a western style.
4
The Quarters is offers a cosy environment in the corner of Icon Village - perfect ambience for a cosy catch-up with friends, away from the hustle and bustle of the traffic around the area. The extensive menu comprising of many interesting fusion dishes left us spoilt with choices- the boss was incredibly patient and helpful in introducing each of their signature items. We tried the Pork belly buns as appetiser- it was great!! The salted egg yolk fried chicken burger was another incredible dish as well- must not miss this! The chicken meat was tender, salted egg yolk sauce was rich and the crispy coating made from their house recipe impressed greatly - they were generous with the herbs and spices!
4
Had dinner with my friend at The Quarters for the first time, using the Snatch app promotion. Staff were friendly and made recommendations for drinks & desserts.
5
Would also recommend the samsui chicken salad which is refreshing and a great complement to their fried food items (salted egg burger etc). Service was wonderful
3
I think the overall service was good and i'm quite happy with the friendly staff. The food was served up fast and the staff were attentive to the people in the restaurant.
4
Tuck away inside Icon village is this restaurant. Small cozy place with a few good Spread. We had their burger, fries and crab meat linguine. Tangy, spicy, was nice
2
Dinner was simple however the menu was very limited. Very much enjoyed the Durian creme brulee. Nice
5
Went on NYE and there wasn't much of a crowd. Service was great! Friendly crew & really yummy food- Chili crab pasta is a must try!!!! Samsui chicken salad is yummy too, really brings out the chicken rice punch ;)
5
Love the chilli crab pasta and the happy hour for beer promo that comes with salted egg fries and chilli crab bun.
2
Made a reservation for lunchtime in hopes of reducing the waiting time, but was told that they had "missed our reservation" and ended up having to wait 15 minutes. Placing an order was a nightmare as well, with the counter staff constantly distracted/confused. Food was decent but a little pricey for the small portions. Salted egg fries ($9) came with a generous amount of dip, chilli crab pasta ($18) was tasty but the portion was too small for the price, and the steak wasn't very tasty. Durian creme brûlée was good but again, portions were minuscule. Would not recommend
4
Really really impressed with the impeccable service showered upon us by the male staff on duty. Attentive to our needs without fail with a positive and friendly attitude certainly made our dining experience an enjoyable and memorable one. Even though the salted egg yolk burgers we had was pretty mediocre and the wonderffles (waffles with lemongrass & pandan ice-cream) was rather disappointing with soft,cakey waffles and icy ice-cream instead of crispy waffles, the service definitely compensated for the disappointment we faced in the palatability of the food. The staff was also receptive to feedback when given, being apologetic and mentioning that he will feedback to the kitchen chef, which was a really thoughtful gesture!
4
We were staying close to here and enjoyed a couple of breakfasts here.The standard breakfast set is $SG8 but you can add things to it for $SG2- bacon, mushrooms etc. The standard includes a creamy scrambled egg, a serve of a coleslaw type salad, a toasted (on request) bun and a cup of tea or coffee. On one occasion it cost us a $SG1 to upgrade our coffee to a flat white and another time it didn't. Its a little hard to find in the bowels of the Icon comples but worth the effort. You can also purchase cocktails here later in the day if takes your fancy and they have some pretty good looking burgers (fusion cooking) on offer. Service is polite and friendly
5
food was great, nice cozy area and at affordable price.. service staff was very polite. highly recommended!
4
We came here for the chilli crab spaghetti and fries with the salted egg yoke sauce. Both were good! The acohol was on the expensive side. Costing as much as the pastas. Overall a nice little café in the CBD area
5
Came after their durian creme brulee, and it did not disappoint! The creme brulee was smooth, and durian flavour was strong! Durian lovers should try it. It's also an innovative idea to make a durian flavoured creme brulee. Worth supporting!
4
Good and pleasant environment. Recommend the salty egg yolk fries. Price is rather reasonable, worth it
3
food - salted egg fries stays crisp after long as mentioned but was it meant to be double fried to stay that way or just oily? satay sauce for the burger is really good, but the chewy rice cake was a little soft to be call chewy?nothing bad about this this place, neither is it fantastic.just a personal opinion.
3
I'd heard good things about the satay burger. A large group of us including a toddler turned up but the restaurant was not open as it was supposed to. And this is despite us having a reservation. The chef proprietor and manager did try to make amends but I'm not sure we'd bother to make another trip.
1
Only one person managing the cafe, waited more than 10 min before the menu was given to us, had to ask a few times before the only waitress/barrister/cashier came to take our orders. Not a welcoming experience with the long waiting time for everything and a grumpy looking waitress serving us. The food was only average , not good enough to make me look pass all the sub-standard service to visit it again when the same money can get me better food and service in other cafes easily
1
Visited The Quarters for lunch with two friends on July 29. We were enticed by the Chope promotion, where we would "enjoy free flow salted egg fries when all parties order a main, only when you book through the Chope app or website to dine in July." To my understanding, free flow salted egg fries means that we would receive a free flow of fries and the accompanying salted egg sauce. However, when we requested additional sauce, the waiter informed us that we would have to pay an additional $2 if we wanted more of the salted egg sauce. This puzzled us, and requested to speak with another waiter since the manager/boss was apparently busy. Waiter #2 was quite adamant in insisting that the promo only included free flow fries, and we would definitely have to pay for more sauce. He said that he would give feedback to Chope about how their promotion was actually worded wrongly so as to avoid confusion in the future. But what were my friends and I to do when we were already there, and the only reason we were there in the first place was to make use of the promo? I felt that this situation was poorly handled by the staff who kept stubbornly insisting the "free flow salted egg fries" promo only meant that we would receive "free flow fries". I suggest The Quarters to word their promotions properly in the future. Finally, the mains we ordered were lacklustre at best. Overall, a disappointing experience and we definitely will not return here or recommend this to anyone
5
The salted egg yolk sauce for the fries was very addictive. The Buah Keluak ice cream was unique and a must try for those adventurous people. Since it was durian season, we had the Durian creme brulee and it was heaven, not too sweet/bitter and not too heavy.Would definitely come again
3
there were 5 of us and we ordered main courses like the fish, curry pasta,chilli crab pasta,fries with salted egg dip and duriancanboleh.We were quite disappointing when we saw the Duriancanboleh was served in an aluminium disposable tart mold and only half filled and it was priced @ $8.50.We won't order that anymore becuase it was not worth that value at all
2
not much service. ordered a salad, fries, pasta, chicken and dessert. overall, the food was forgettable. the durian crème brulee was the only highlight. glad I tried it once but I doubt I will return.
4
Great service by staff! Had Chilli crab pasta, fries, wonderffle and durian creme brûlée. All of which tasted good. Though it would be better if the salted egg sauce was warmed and the portion durian creme brûlée... Larger 😅
3
Found this interesting cafe with modern local food and gave it a try with my colleagues for birthday lunch! Good twist to food - eg: buah keluk ice cream, salted egg dip with fries. Definitely worth returning
5
The venue, though small is nice enough to have a quick and full lunch. Service staff are attentive and timely.
5
Uncrowded on a Saturday evening (big plus), good food with reasonable prices (another plus). I'll be back!
1
3 persons meal can be up to $62. Average service . Food was small portion. Bacon was not crispy and poached egg was not done properly. Terrible salted egg fries(the sauce mixed with salted egg) . It doesn't taste of any salted egg guess too much mayo. Not value for mone
4
No crowd on a weekday evening. Staff were attentive. Signature dishes such as Salted egg fries and Ma Jie's Indulgence were as good as previous visit. Umami babi + Curry Favour was a bit disappointing. Har Cheong gai chicken was awesome although the belachan was quite strong. Pity that the salted egg mantou is not available for ala carte order!
5
I've been here many times and keep ordering the same things: chilli crab pasta, clam pasta and durian creme brulee. Decided to be adventurous and tried the curry favour pasta for the 1st time yesterday and boy, did it hit the spot. Think of a very good version of carbonara with a kick of curry. Amazing blend of flavours. Friendly chillax waitstaff and the best lattes around. Always a pleasure, always. ☺️ Glad the quality has been maintained (and even been improved!) Keep it up, guys!
1
I had to wait for a long time for my food while the rest of my colleagues had finished their's. No reason was given for the terrible delay. Was hard to get attention of service staff and the attitude of staff was bad
4
The founder, Mr Chung Deming painstakingly emphasized the fresh spices in their "saucery". The 4 of us unanimously agreed that the sauces and dips were superbly created and experimented. While the main meat be if fish or chicken, was not unforgettable, we love the sauces and dips. My friend loves the baramundi - nicely pan seared and taste wonderful with the special sauce. Then the REAL surprise was the desserts! Absolutely no disappointment - especially the rich moist brownies with the unusual one of a kind buah keluak ice cream - was so perfect! I love the coffees too - strong yet not overpoweringly bitter. Since it was our first visit, I have to try a few more items to give a fairer review. Mr Chung let us try his new "experiment' a nondescript looking one - but I love the unmistaken subtle taste of white pepper and the lingering floral note ! Wow, like a good wine. We were there on a weekend, enjoyed a quiet and relaxed lunch ,,without office lunch crowd :) I did not realise there was no service taxes till I left the place - apologies for not remembering to check the bill and to leave a tip! I certainly will on my next visit!
