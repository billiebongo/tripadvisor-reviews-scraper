Nice restaurant, good atmosphere with a nice terrace close to the river. Pizzas are good at reasonable prices.
5
A little bit expensive but nicely located facing the river at Robertson Quay. The burrata pizza and calzone are delicious. Tiramisu is very good too. Spend $100 for 2 with a glass of prosecco and a glass of red wine.
5
Have visited Rosso Vino a few times now, and it's a really beautiful restaurant with seated Bar option also.Very nice location in Robertson Quay next to the river, and is the perfect place to sit back, eat great food, drink great cocktails and people watch and relax.Very special mention to Giri behind the bar. A real good barman. Makes very very good cocktails, is attentive, always likes a chat with the patrons, but is not too intrusive. A real gent and professional.Would definetly reccommend Rosso Vino for anyone who wants a chilled evening away from the noise of Clarke Quay

On our last night in Singapore we were craving traditional Italian made pizza. After a quick search on trip advisor we settled on Rosso Vino and boy were we not disappointed. The restaurant is located on the river edge of Singapore's Quay area and provides a relaxed atmosphere. My advice is make sure you arrive in time for the 2 for 1 cocktails. Our Bar Manager Giri made sure our cocktails were to absolute perfection and really went over and above to make our experience memorable. The food was also perfection and we enjoyed a Pizza and GNOCCHI AL PESTO . Having eaten is some amazing and expensive restaurants on our trip, our experience @ Rosso Vino is the one we keep talking about visiting again on our next trip

If you are looking for real Italian cuisine, this restaurant is where you definitely want to go. You may want to reserve for an outdoor table and try their specials as they are superb. Personally, I recommend you to try gnocchi Sorrentina because it was the best gnocchi I had outside Italy

Booked an outside table for an evening meal during a 2 day stopover in Singapore. Great location by the river and nice quality food. Not cheap, but then nothing really is in Singapore! Excellent quality house wine at a decent price.Steaks were good as were the pizza and desserts. Vegetables were a little cold when they arrived (think they are part steamed and then grilled before serving and the second bit was missed out), but money was taken off final bill accordingly, so not a big deal.Only real problem was ignorant couple on next table who were not eating themselves and insisted on blowing cigar smoke our way whilst we were eating. Can’t blame the restaurant for that though.Overall recommended and worth a visit
4
If you want too get away from the noise of Robertson Quay. And have a great peaceful time out head straight to this Restaurant. It’s only five minute walk away , want be disappointed. And the prices are very reasonable compared to the Quay area.

Was staying close to this restaurant and saw the reviews. My husband and I had just arrived in Singapore and I had very bad swollen feet due to many temples, steps and flights. It was around 6 ish and noticed there were reserved tables, but a few still vacant. Asked for a table for two, the guy looked me up and down, said have you a booking of which I said no we had just arrived. He pointed to an outside bar set up, and I said with my feet that I could not sit there, of which he replied then there is no vacancy. What a pompous person who has no idea of what customer service is all about, as I believe that there is always an option. I would not go there on principal no matter what the food tasted lik
3
after seeing the positive reviews, I am sorry to say we as a group of 4 were disappointed with both the food and the service.we were belatedly celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary,and this visit was supposed to be an extra treat, prior to our cruise.the food was average at best and the lasagne was burnt and tasteless.the service particular for singapore was slow, and the general atmosphere was dull.with all the great restaurants in singapore it made us wish we had selected another in this delightful are
5
The food was superb. We tasted the pizzas , salads and tenderloin on Italian way.The hospitality was excellent. The atmosphere fantastic just like little Italy. The location is very nice and romantic by the river and it is highly recommendable to eat outside. Remember to ask for an outdoor table when you reserve
5
Great Menu and great service. I went to this restaurant while in Singapore and was greatly surprised by the quality of the food and wine.Both times I had a group with me and the last time their was 16 of us. Everyone was very satisfied with their dinner. The Pizza and the pasta was excellent !! Great selection of wines from all over the world ( especially Italy).If you are in Singapore I highly recommend this restaurant. Great location near the river and shopping.District 10. Host was very kind to take all 16 of us at last minute
5
What an awesome place to have a relaxing meal on a Friday night. The food was great, especially the dessert and Giri is the bomb for serving drinks! Thanks for a great meal and evening
5
Fabulous Italian restaurant ran by a young guy called Carlo from Sicily. There is a wide selection of food ranging from pasta and pizza through to steaks, chicken etc.We ate a steak and a lasagne and both were very good but all the food looked great.Good selection of wines, all Italian, at sensible prices.Nice atmosphere and be sure to ask for a table near the river.Top tip. If you book through Chope they will send you an email offering you the opportunity to buy a voucher at a discount. Worked fine at the restaurant
5
Nothing but huge positive enjoyment , with wonderful food, amazing cocktails ( Singapore sling is a must, expertly made by the lovely Giri AMAZING !) really friendly , jolly staff, from Pizza’s to Fettuccine, Tiriamusu & pistachio ice cream, bliss, what a fabulous way to relax & unwind in wonderful surroundings, enjoying fabulously tasty freshly prepared scrummy food & drinks , many thanks to you all, especially Jignesh & Giri for such an enjoyable dinning experience ,
4
Walked all the way from Clark Quay, and it was worth it. (5 mins)Very nice setting along the river, helped by a nice evening breeze.Pizza was good, but what sets this place above most others is the efficient and very friendly service, and the most amazing world class Tiramisu. A bit expensive at sgd 15+, but freshly home made ... it's heaven and a must try.Will come again.. and taste some more pasta on my next trip
5
Awesome FoodAuthentic ItalianDrinks are wonderfulAwesome BarkeeperA good place to be in singaporeCheers Gir

It is hard to find a restaurant in Singapore that has nice service, good food, and a delightful atmosphere for an understable price. Rossi Vino definitely delivered this.
4
we had our New Year dinner at Rosso Vino. The food was very delicious and the place itself is very nice. Given the price range I would have expected a little bit more refinement or adventure in the dishes, but overall it's a nice place
5
My partner brought me here to celebrate my birthday today. The restaurant was not overly crowded at 6pm and we had a quiet and delicious meal. Food was served in 15 minutes, I think that's not too long. We had fettucine bolognese, proschuitto di melone, gnocchi sorrentina, pepperoni pizza and tiramisu. We are not italian so I can't say the food was truly italian. But our personal opinion was that the all the food was very tasty especially the appetizer and gnocchi. Price was affordable and our total bill was 117 sgd. Service staff was polite and helpful. I did not notice their names but all of them who served us today were polite. My partner also indicated on my reservation (through chope app) that it was for a birthday and they celebrated with us with a song and lit candle on our tiramisu. The ambiance indoors got cozier as it turned dark outside. Overall we had a very happy time here, will bring our friends and families next time if they are craving for tasty italian food :)
5
It is really a big chance that we found Rosso Vino..al ItalinThe owners are real Italian guys..and the pizza is!you could get your dinner at the edge of river with a good service and reasonable prices.
5
I would like to commend this restaurant. First, the service was great. We were greeted as we entered and the waitress had a friendly smile. All through out the time we were there the staff tend to us and gave us extra mile service. Second, the pasta and pizza was awesome. I recommend to try their spaghetti marinara! Last, the ambiance was great. It has a romantic feel to it. Me and my husband enjoyed our food while dining. Thank you Rosso Vino
5
It was my first experience i visit there nd i found tht the service was exelent, i must say tht guy his name was jignesh his service was really awesome, the way he present his self was frendly nd polite... my all friends really appreciate his service,, at the last but not least i would lyk to say tht i will defienatly visit tht place again , nd i hope i will find the same service from tht guy in future
5
This place is beautiful and a perfect place to have a surprise birthday for love ones. The staffs and foods are awesomes.  Ravioli and alfredo pasta is our favorite in the menu. Will definitely recommend this place to our friends and relatives. Will come back again

After a great day seeing so much of Singapore, we looked to relax over a nice meal near our hotel, Rosso Vino looked to be the answer, well it certainly wasn’t.Perhaps at this stage I should say that the lady serving us was good, as for the rest of it, not good.We shared bruschetta to start, which was completely under cooked.The main courses were pasta, not sure what a true Italian would make of these dishes, but poor is the polite word.This was one of these restaurants geared up just to capture the holiday market, good or bad review, they are not too worried if they see you again.If you’re staying in this area and you fancy tasting Italian, well this place won't settle your Italian taste buds
1
The greeting was cold and unwelcoming. Service was horrible. The food was good, but the lack attention by the staff was totally unacceptable. You should be ashamed of yourselves
5
Excellent place for a quiet dinner and drinks at a reasonable price. Extensive menu with choices for all to enjoy. Staff was excellent. Best time to come is at the daily happy hour/ 2 for 1 drinks and the head bartender (Giri) does an excellent job at mixing your favorite cocktail
5
We had a very enjoyable night sitting outside with some beverages. One word of caution...the pasta was a little undercooked
5
Probably the best ravioli I’ve had outside of Italy. The bruschetta was good, bit lighter of a flavor without the heavy garlic common at many restaurants.
5
Just had a lovely evening at Rosso Vino. Arrived early to get in happy hour buy one get one free. Wife had sex on the beach cocktail and me Tiger beer. Meal was served quickly and piping hot. Fettuccine Alfredo and fettuccine bologna see both very good. Dessert was gelato and panacotta again very tasty. At the end of the meal Giri one of the staff gave us a complimentary Limoncello much appreciated. A lovely inexpensive evenin
5
I visited this great restaurant several times during two trips to Singapore, and enjoyed it immensely. First impression was excellent, as we've arrived to Singapore very late, and still managed to get a great dinner (try their special set, if it's available, it's great), and our further visits crearly reconfirmed it! Food is excellent, team working there is exceptionally friendly and welcoming, and the place has such a great atmosphere that you want to return there, drink some wine and enjoy it :
5
We were lucky enough to get a walk in table last week & it was amazing! I had the Porcini Ravioli, which was beautiful, and we also had pizzas which were fantastic. The service was excellent & we will definitely be back.
5
Great atmosphere and the food looks and tastes amazing. I love lasagne, the chef makes them exactly as my mum would make. The staff is really helpful and polite and all the guys always go the extra mile. Defo a must go-to place
5
I already visited this restaurant in 2016, and held a very good memory of it. I went back a couple days ago and found it even better! You absolutely need to try it, you'll hardly find anything better around here. You eat marvellously and with a great service, at a good price. Will definitely go back
5
I usually go to Singapore twice a year and never fail to stop for dinner or drinks.I love the location, the atmosphere and the staff
5
Rosso vino, is basically a kind of home.Since the first time i came there i felt like home, everything is gret, the food so delicious and the staff always so kind and helpful.That is really a proper italian restaurant.Love everything

Came back here with a good memory and left with another memorable one!Great service and amazing food.Italian at his best..highly reccomende

The place is very unwelcoming. Staff is rude and inattentive. Place is dirty - waitress tried to clean our table 3 times. Food is just not tasty. Bruschetta not good, pasta - tasteless, pizzza - it wasnâ€™t pizz

No control of what is ordered and what is served. Ordered a gluten free dish. Upon asking if the dish was gluten free it was confirmed so. 5 min later they came back and said wait, it's not gluten free! This despite being ordered from their standard menu and asked directly if the dished served was gluten free. When approaching management for an explanation, the manager did not have the courage to come forward reassuring us that this will not happend again. People make mistakes, but you would like a reassurance from management that they take this serious and will do their utmost to avoid a repetition. Not at this restaurant! When approaching management, they did not come forward. Management hiding behind their staff is not acceptable. Makes you wander what else management accept and do? We ended up having our hot main dishes served at 20 min intervals. They even have the courage to charge 10% service charge. For what, almost poisening one of their guest?Enjoy your meal

food was good, penne with mushroom cream sauce was lovelyhad a good view of the new year's eve fireworks
5
Pizzas and appetizers are amazing. Must order drink is a Negroni ... Giri finishes it with a flamboyant touch
4
Nice friendly staff. Good menu choices. Food was good but not great. Good serving sizes. Wines are reasonably priced and good selection.Toilets are awful and they need to fix the door on the ladies as you have to push it hard to open it. They could do with a paint and clean up. Also smelt of cigarette smoke. Would go back as the staff were really good, friendly and very professional
4
Good wholesome Italian pastas, salads, and mains at a reasonable price.Get a table outside and make sure to book as its popula

Having spent the day travelling from Malaysia, we were looking for a soft landing into Singapore where we could chill within walking distance of our hotel. We found Rosso Vino on TA and decided to give it a go, and proving to be a good decision. We had a nice table outside by the river which was refreshing after the plane. It had been a little while since we had eaten non-Asian food, so it was nice to have a change and the food was good. It was well located and we took an easy stroll afterwards to stretch our legs and soak up the atmosphere. It was a great start to our stay and where you had to pinch yourself to remind that you were in Singapore and not Europe
5
Great Italian restaurant by the Singapore river. Ideal for romantic dinners. Food was amazing and service impeccable. The atmosphere also made our dinner at Rosso Vino an unforgettable moment
5
Rosso Vino is a great restaurant. The food, staff and location are fantastic. I highly recommend this place
5
We went with family and it was a very memorable experience. The food was very tasty. A bit overpriced I think
4
Rosso Vino Located at 15 Merbau Road, Next Robertson Quay Hotel, Singapore. Been of an Italian background, I am always on the watch for good Italian restaurants. This restaurant offers authentic Italian food. The environment is relaxed and you feel like you are dining in a friendâ€™s home. Food is very well presented and nice portions too. We tried several dishes that was on offer, all delicious with the real Italian taste, the highlight for me was antipasti, several type of pastas, and off course the pizza, all were outstanding. Unfortunately after all that food we were just too full to try the desserts, which I'm sure they must be delicious, anyway I must confess it was the tastiest Italian food I've had for a while & it didn't break the bank. About the Service and atmosphere also get really high marks! Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience, exquisite food and great wine selections. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Italian cuisine
4
Really enjoyed the food here, sat by the side of the river watching the world go by. Both dishes of pasta were very tasty. Remember to get there before 7pm for Happy hour
5
You know how great is kids enjoying the food, right ?? We enjoyed the wine, pasta, antipasti and pizza. Good service and decent italian food as if it a cooked from Toscana.
3
Top 50 restaurant in tripadvisor and i decided to tryBy the "river" (feels like a big drain though) and we sat indoors due to the rain. Decor is old and rustic. Antipasto, pasta and pizzas are average, though the beef on the pizza is generousDon't get it why it's top 5
5
Finally got to try this place out and I absolutely loved it! Got the salmon cream pasta, steak and pizza. The food was delicious and really authentic. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and would definitely come back again
5
Impeccable Service, excellent food , splendid setup.Had dinner at RossoVino numerous times, never once been disappointed.Congratulation 
4
Had dinner with family including kids. It was good atmosphere & food was good. Service was good. Value for money on special occasions
5
I had the burrata cheese with tomatoes and pasta of the day which was irresistible bacon and egg. I just wish I was in a better mood. My bf broke up with me that day right before we started eating. I literally had zero appetite but managed to taste a bite of food. I have to say it is a lovely place for private conversations as the booth seats are long and closed off to any other diners. I'd love to come back and actually enjoy a meal here someday.
4
The quality of food was alright. Service crew wasn’t attentive enough. Have to call a few times to get attention.
2
A friend's 40th birthday. A chef too. Favourite cuisine-Italian. What should have been a lovely evening was a disappointment- food itself was fine but having to wait 45minutes between courses was a damper. We had to remind the waitress to take our order for the mains and that we'd arranged a special cake for the birthday girl. Party of 6, stuck in the back of the restaurant and forgotten. A real shame. Could not recommend
4
Ate here as I love pizza and it had good TA ratings. Very nice outdoor seating by the river and the river walkway. Enjoyed people watching, having a cold beer and a very good pizza
5
We found this place researching restaurants before we left for Singapore. On our second day there, after visiting Chinatown, we decided to give it a try. We called for reservations and took the MRT to Robertson Quay. This is a nice small restaurant on the river. We got a small table near outside and had a great dinner. We decided to try a gourmet cheese platter as an appetizer, and it was fabulous. Everyone got their favorite meals (I had lasagna) and we ate and drank for a couple of hours, watching all the people stroll by on the river walk.This is a great place in Singapore if you want to get your Italian "fix". Great food and atmosphere. After dinner, take a nice stroll along the river to Clarke Quay
4
Beautiful restaurant, beautiful location. Food was excellent tho it took quite some time to prepare. We waited for around 20 mins for our mains to arrive. No problems with the drinks. Arrived immediately after order was placed. Food was delicious and portion was acceptable. Great ambience
5
Went there with a friend for dinner and it was a great experience. Food is amazing, best Italian I’ve had in Singapore. Definitely going back soon
5
We saw the good reviews on TripAdvisor and were not disappointed. Authentic Italian food and very attentive service. A great find
5
I had a Carpaccio as a starter and a beef filet as a main and both were excellent! Super service as well thanks :
5
We have been coming to Singapore for 10 years. It has become a regular eating place for us. Right by the river with outside tables. Swift, friendly, efficient and knowledgeable service. The name has changed but the genuine Italianfood has if anything it got better and better. It always was good but one can say with confidence it is excellent - especially now we persuaded it that red wine is drunk at room temperature!.The staff have become old friends
5
I'm Italian and I can tell that this place is authentic!Chef is from Sardinia and manager is from Sicily.Pizza is a must try!Highly recommended
4
Enjoyed the food here and for Singapore it is very reasonably priced. I had the ravioli with prawns and husband had the calzone which he said was one of the best he's ever had. If you want a nice Italian meal and don't want to break the bank then I'd definitely recommend this place
5
Our meals were amazing. Flavors of our pasta was outstanding. Service impeccable. Exceptional service and food. Atmosphere fantastic
5
Very good Singapore Slings to accompany the passing storm on the river. Engaging staff who make you feel welcome
5
We stopped here for a cocktail or two on our first night in Singapore. Fantastic Singapore sling and marguerita. Lovely chilled vibe and served by the very friendly bar staff. Although we didnâ€™t eat the food looked great and a lovely setting on the edge of the water.
4
Good, genuine Italian cuisine but more importantly excellent service from bartender~Giri!! Cheers...
5
The food along with wine and nice ambience making it complete. Surprisingly quite crowded too. Grea
4
First of all, the food was of good quality and tasted very good! We ordered 2 plates of pasta and the both servings were generous with fresh ingredients. The dessert was a candy to the tongue! We enjoyed our meal very much! It was a pleasant twist to our normal dinners!However, we waited too long for our food to be served (i.e. close to 1 hour) and for the bill. This was a tad disappointing as the restaurant did not serve us bread with olive oil (at the least for every Italian restaurant) in order to fill up our hungry stomachs. Nonetheless, bravo to the dishes 
5
Great Esspresso Martini served by Giri. Followed by a Caipirihna. Nice ambience and good chill. Definietly a place to return. Excellent job
5
Sunday night dinner with family. Our food was as good as any Italian restaurant in Australia. Good atmosphere and a reasonable price
4
Great views, good food and attentive service from this quietly-located waterside restaurant, only five minutes walk away from the noise and hubbub of Clarke Quay. A menu based on various pasta or pizza dishes and a good wine selection make for a tasty and reasonably costed experience.
4
Ate here recently. It's one of the few options for someone eating solo as I don't like to sit at a table alone. The bar sat about 8 people if needed. That night, there were two seats taken.My bartender was attentive and also very good. I drank Amarone wine and had the bruschetta along with the fettucine bolognese. Good food, will keep on the revisit list the next time I am in Singapore
5
There are outdoor and indoor seat, which both got nice ambient. The best enjoyable thing is definitely the pizza.
5
We stayed nearby and this restaurant was very handily located on the riverfront. I ordered the chef special pizza which was beyond reproach. Simple and delicious. Two for one happy hour beers sealed the deal
5
I didn’t intend on eating Italian during my visit to Singapore. But I broke down late on the 7th evening and sat at the inviting small bar (5-6 seats) at Rosso Vino for an evening meal. This is a quaint place on the waterway by Robertson Quay and only about a 300 meter walk from Clarke’s Quay with both indoor and outdoor seating. The first night was great. Attentive and friendly staff, excellent food (I had the pizza special with got cheese, Italian ham, etc.), and a gentle breeze at the bar. Given the experience, I went back on the last night of my trip. Again, I sat at the bar. And it was during this visit that I started to understand why these guys are so good. Carlo, the bartender, is from Sicily. But more importantly, he is the brother of the owner and the general manager. I watched as he worked with the staff, engaged with the kitchen, all in the spirit of delivering great service to his patrons. I learned that that he came to Singapore to open the restaurant. In fact, he painted the stairwell that sits next to the outdoor bar. He doesn’t just run the business, he helped to build it. So there is no surprise that the 2nd night’s meal was just as good if not better. Home made fettucine in a homemade bolognese sauce. The food was excellent, price fair for the area, the location inviting, and the service exceptional. If you are looking for a great meal, look no further. It is hard to find places that deliver a triple threat: great service, great food, great location. So when you find them, you gotta share. The only thing that could make it better?? Maybe a little Italian music in the background. I am going back the next time I am in Singapore.

The setting is lovely and the service was really good but certainly I wouldn't call this restaurant Italian. It has Italian dishes but they have been adapted to suit an international audience no doubt. The food tasted ok but if any of the dishes we had, was served in a restaurant in Italy, it wouldn't go down well.The bruschetta rossa...was truly shocking, it's more like the garlic bread, you'd find in a takeway pizza restaurant in the Uk. And there is a different between garlic bread and bruschetta. The spaghetti al pomodoro was disappointing, full of cream...again a basic staple italian dish ruined . I've not visited many Italian restaurant in Singapore but this is certainly not the best nor i would call it italian. italian food is fresh, simple and tasty ...the food at Rosso Vino was full of cream/besciamel, sloppy and soggy bread
5
Me and my girlfriend had dinner at this place yesterday, eating "ravioli con gamberini in crema allo zafferano". It was really delicious! One of the best pasta I have ever eaten. Strongly recommend this place if you are looking for some good Italian food
3
Nothing fantastic or impressive about the food. The mussels in our spaghetti marinara was very fishy.
5
Great setting by the river, great service, amazing food. Nothing you can complain about here. Carlo & his team are fantastic. From start to finish we were looked after with warm hospitality. I cannot recommend coming here enough, you will not be disappointed!
5
Great menu, excellent food, and best of all terrific service.Without a doubt the best Italian, and probably the best restaurant in Singapor
4
Recently visited On a Friday afternoon, early evening. The restaurant was very quite as we were quite early. None the less very friendly efficient service. Didn't need to book just turned up. Nice fresh pizza with a good amount of topping. Pleasant and attentive staff without being over bearing. Would call again
5
Always met with a warm welcome. It's been two years since our last visit and they not only remembered us but also remembered what we like to order. Calezone mmmmm just superb. It came just how we remembered, the thinnest crust you could imagine and the filling..... my mouth is watering writing this. We are going back tonight for another.
5
Stumbled on Rosso Vino by accident and so pleased we did! Eventually visited three times and each time the food and service were excellent. All courses were superb and if in Singapore I cannot recommend them enough. All this and Happy Hour from 4.30 till 7.30 and with drink prices in Singapore this is a definite benefit
4
Staying at the hotel next door, after an exhausting day great to be able to walk next door and get a hot, tasty pizza to relax and eat in our roo
5
First visit was a "stumble on" in need of cool drink and aircon. Friendly staff and the look of other diners food (not to mention 2 for 1 Guinness Happy Hour Deal) convinced us to stay for dinner. What could possibly go wrong?Well, nothing.......great Greek Salad and lovely Pizza washed down with great wine, bliss.Second visit did not disappoint either and the final flourish, complementary Limoncello.Getting It Right - Simple
4
Ate here with my daughter on my last night in Singapore as it was close to our hotel.Lovely staff, lovely food at a reasonable price.We had 1 for 1 cocktails in the happy hour.Wish we had discovered this area earlier as there were lots more restaurants all along the waterfront
4
Looking for an Italian option, we found Rosso Vino in the TA reviews and made a reservation. We opted fro a walk along the river from the Fairmont to get there. It was a pleasant walk through the city and past Boat Quay, where the younger crowd was very active! We found Vino Rosso just past a bridge and right on the riverside. An outdoor bar and multiple tables outsides as well as an indoor area with A/C. We opted for an outside table where we started with a cold beer and then a bottle of wine. The wine list had some nice choices from Italy, but as is in Singapore, all were pricey. We opted for a Rose' from Puglia that was reasonably priced. We then had an appetizer of Prosciutto and Melon that was very nice. For a main course, we had a pasta dishes that we found to be well made and very fresh. We completed the meal with a Panna Cotta. The meal was further enhanced by a good quality of service and the lovely setting
5
Came here 3 nights in a row.Very welcoming staff and good food at a fair price.Nice location close to the center
5
what a great place! italian at his best!wonderful pizza and pasta.been here with a friend and got to meet Carlo the manager. Great service and highly reccomended
5
Having a dinner with my friend, we had some antipasti,pasta & pizza all food speak for itself. Staff are friendly & attentive. 
5
We were staying in the area so chose to eat here due to it's good location (near our hotel AND walking distance to Clarke Quay). The food was delicious and the service was good. It was busy but the staff got us a table quickly! Was disappointed as it was raining so we couldn't sit outside but we didn't really mind as inside was great too
4
Pizza is amazingly good while pasta could be better. Staffs tend to neglect customers sitting indoor, would appreciate if they could be more attentive at their service.
5
Reasonably priced, but not at the expense of quality or size. Family of five, we all found something wonderfull to eat.My wifes raviolli with prawns in cream saffron sauce was amazing. Good wine selection.Lovely deserts
5
Food served together however the bigger your group the longer the wait. Serving size is good. Operates till late night so it was goo
5
we had pizza and pasta with low expectations but were very happy with our meal - very authentic tasting Italian pasta and pizza with very friendly staff. Very reasonably priced
4
We had the home made Alfredo, and the capricciosa.. we were so impressed by both dishes! The pasta tasted authentic, and totally fulfilled our hopes. The pizza base was fresh and crispy where it counted, and tasted like a cap should! Nice location, on the quieter side of the river, well priced and the staff go above and beyond.. overall an excellent experience.. :) Thanks guys!Julia and Lorenzo from Melbourne Aus.
4
After a round of local food my wife and I needed something European and Italian was our choice. I had researched the many Italian restaurants in Singapore and decided on the Rosso Vino largely because of its setting by the river. Happily it turned out to be a good choice.We shared a starter and a dessert and for mains chose lamb and black squid ink spaghetti (very good, generous serving).An enjoyable well balanced meal with a glass each of a very enjoyable Italian red and a bill for around S$120, very reasonable in a city of high-priced restaurants.Recommended for lovers of Italian food
5
Great and quiet atmosphere. Good food and the best lavacake on the world. Love to come back. One of my favourite Restaurants in Singapore.
5
Exceptional staff, fantastic food, lovely ambience. The manager was so very friendly, as was our waitress. Could not ask for a nicer place.
4
We had a lovely meal here, the service was very good and the food was of a high standard. The restaurant is right next to the river by Clark quay so convenient for a night out
3
By the river next door to the Robertson Quay Hotel, this indoor and outdoor restaurant was very friendly and served reasonable priced food and coffees as well as drinks. Very pleasant to sit outside watching people.
4
This Italian restaurant was very close to the Studio M Hotel where I was staying. This restaurant served a huge variety of Pizzas. I had the seafood pizza, very good and I would recommend it
5
Picked this restaurant to dine yesterday on the eve of my birthday as reviews on their FB were all positive & I wasn't disappointed. HIGHLY RECOMMEND to everyone for their TOP NOTCH service, AMAZING food & AWESOME location by the river.Thank U so much, Carlos & team (esp lady attendant with RED LIPS!). We were so pampered by your hospitality & continuous efforts to make sure that everything was ok for us. It was an incredible dining experience & we will DEFINITELY BE BACK AGAIN! Torneremo presto â™
5
Nice environment; friendly staff in the outskirts of Clarke Quay. Good loaded drinks btw. Diverse menu to enjoy in open space by the river
5
Went after reading reviews and wasn't disappointed. Great food and exceptional wine and just down the river from Clarke quay. Friendly staff and perfect for kids
5
This is definitely a necessary stop! We have visited many times and will continue to do so when we are back! Carlo is a truly an exceptional host, always willing to suggest favorite menu choices and wines when asked. The appetizers, pizzas and pastas are truly outstanding! Giri makes a fabulous Long Island Iced Tea too!! The ambiance is peaceful and beautiful along the river's edge. We enjoy the conversations with staff! Truly a place worth stopping!

The food here was very good - I had the Calamari followed by the pork ribs. Both were very good. My wife had the caprese and then prosciutto which were also excellent. Because there was a very noisy party of 10 nearby, the waitress moved us to a quieter area, which was very appreciated
5
Been here a few times when in Singapore. The food is great, the staff are friendly and it's good value (for singapore).
5
We had a fabulous dinner here. From the time we arrived, we had awesome service and a warm genuine welcome. The setting was nice, along the riverbank of the serene Singapore River. The food was excellent and delivered exactly as we asked for. The wine was also surprisingly superb and served in quality wine glasses. Definitely a restaurant worth visiting again. 5 stars.
4
We went there for dinner and found a classic Italian menu. Pizza and pastas were really good, service warm and genuine. Just a comment was I found some items quite overpriced such as mash potatoes at $11. They must not sell many
5
When you walk past this place during the day, it looks pretty dubious. But thankfully we noted the good reviews on Trip Advisor and gave it a chance. Brilliant Italian food with lots of options, great wine list and friendly staff. Once the heat of the day disappears, sitting by the Singapore River with friends in this place is simply lovely. Really enjoyed it.
5
Was there with my girlfriend on Wednesday! Had an awesome Pizza and delicious Chocolate Vulcano Cake as desert! Ordered some extra garlic for the Pizza and it was for free. Since it was Wednesday wie could drink Mojito for just 8$ all night long! Great location and absolutely friendly staff! Would come back again, right away!
4
Had a meal here one night while staying in Singapore. Very friendly and helpful staff. Really enjoyed the food. Good choice on the menu. Would recommend
4
Had a really nice dinner. Friendly staff, nice view. Had the trofie homemade pasta & we couls tell it was from an italian chef. Would recommend
5
I found this restaurant on google maps (gluten free near me) and was delighted to find that they had a separate gluten free menu. I ordered Penne and I think I had the pesto sauce either way it was delicious. The staff were knowledgeable about gluten free as I quizzed them about the salad that I also ordered. They were attentive and I would recommend if you are after gluten free pasta, with friendly service
5
Came across this place, just for a quick drink, lovely staff especially Recy lovely lady, so friendly and her boss is a decent guy. Highly recommended
3
Really nice location at the riverside I Singapore. Service and food was good, but I find the price level too high even for this location.
4
Great place for dinner. Not easy to find restaurant that have gluten free & vegetarian option at same time. Perfect choice for us. Like their pasta + tiramisu. Yummy the waiter gave us a small drink as bonus(forgot its name.but its a alcohol drink with yellow color
4
A perfect place for dinner with your partner. Especially if both of you have special needs of food. Am a vegetarian & my bf cannot eat food that made of gluten so we felt very excited to see they have those option of food for us. Bonus for me that their tiramisu taste very yummy & serve in quite big portion. Friendly staff as well. Thank youuuu rosso vin
5
We went there because me and my friends are craving for nice italian food. I guess this place is more than what we expected. What make the food great is that they also have nice people accomodating you. Cheers!

1. When we arrived there were 2 Italian fellows standing at the hostess desk with their backs facing us and chatting. Completely ignoring my family and I.2. Had to wave to get some attention and finally walked to our table. 3. Waited for a few minutes to get our order taken by a rude waitress. I was ordering the food and she kept looking at the opposite direction. Totally no body language and extremely rude!4. Lack of upselling skills and didn't even offer us any wines.5. When we ordered the food we specified that we wanted the salads and my son's pizza First but all the food came together after 20minutes. When we asked her why did she bring the food out all together, she simply said we asked for it.6. The Indian waiter was smoking behind the restaurant under a shaded area. Does the Manager even train or tell the employees that it's prohibited to smoke under a shaded area??7. There was no service at all in this restaurant.Bottom line poor management, leads to poor staff attitude. The restaurant looks shabby and lack of pleasant personalities.We are staying at Robertson Walk and we restaurant hop everyday. We will definitely avoid this restaurant! BETTER TO GO TO LUCA' s Trattoria!!
5
We stayed at Park hotel and this is just around the corner. They have a happy hour where it's 2 for 1 cocktails so if I was you i would make the most of this. The cocktails around Singapore get quite expensive otherwise. We didn't have any food but everyone around us who was eating was quite vocal about how much they enjoyed it. The cocktails are great and the barman makes one delicious Singapore Sling. you MUST try the frozen margaritas!! don't even question it, just get it
5
I enjoy the Spaghetti Bolognese and the Seafood Risotto...and all the ice creams pistacho, dark chocolate and vanilla! It is a short distance from home ... a place I come often
5
Food is great but the hospitality is even better. The team are so friendly and accommodating. I came for my friends birthday and they organised a dessert with sparkler complete with birthday music! Such a great team and they always seem really happy to accommodate requests. Always a pleasure
4
We had a nice italian meal one evening after touring the city. a 5 minute stroll from our hotel the restaurnat was right on the Singapore River. With both alfresco and inside seating the outside was really perfect. Watching the river bridges change colour and the people strolling and walking alongside the river made it such a relaxing place to visit. My wife had lasagna whilst i had the fettuccine carbonara. Wine was by the glass and complimented the meal superbly. We did not have room for dessert and the Management complemented our visit with some ice cold lemon shots. A truly nice way to finish. If you're in the region of Clarke and Robertson Quays then this is well worth a visit. Pricing was quite reasonable and the service excellent
4
What a great place, along the far end of Clark Quay, the start of Robertson Quay its easy to find. With tables both inside and out, a few seats available at the bar there are options for everyone. The food is of very good quality and the Pizzas are cooked to perfection. A good selection of drinks are also available. Add to all of the, the staff are so friendly and even remembered us when we walked past the restaurant a few days later and said hi
5
We used Rosso Vino, 3 minutes from Park Hotel. Nice location and premises, in or outdoors, Extensive Italian menu, reasonably priced and really good food.
3
With such a high rating, we expected an exceptional Italian meal and unfortunately everything was forgettable. There is no way this should even be in the top 250 restaurants in Singapore.
3
Even though the staff were extremely attentive and kind... it was very very slow... and dishes were ok.. Maybe the place is good for only drinks which is oooook..
5
Following the good reccomendation I went there and I wasn't disappointed! Italian Manager and Chef, good food and beautiful location..way to go
5
Nice place and people. Great food, they know how to please you. We ordered greek salad, roasted bread with cheese and tomatos, pomadoro penne and alfredo fettuccine. All of them was delecious
5
We had dinner here recently whilst staying at the Swissotel Merchant Court which is just a short walk away. The pasta and pizzas were all excellent and the service was attentive and friendly. Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a change from the local cuisine and you like Italian food.
5
We were staying at the Park Hotel and had a night flight to Melbourne so did not want to venture far for a meal. We couldn't have done better than eat here both for the food and ambience. The staff were friendly too and the prices reasonable. Only slight gripe was that the air con was just too cold after a while and we had our coffee outside
4
Had the risotto and ravioli and the latter was delicious! Service slowed down once it became busy after 8pm and we had to refill the wine ourselves.
5
Everything is this restaurant has coopered for me to have one of the best nights since I arrived in Singapore. First, the ambience is awesome with a design that really reminds you Italy. Second, the attendance is high level, with an incredible dynamic from all the attendants. My special complement to the the waiter Giri that was far the most humorous waiter ever. I have no words for the food, the plate of cheese me and my boyfriend took was amazing and I just loved their combination of mozzarella cheese with honey and bread. I completely advise you to go to this restaurant
4
A great little Italian eatery at the start of Robertson Quay. We have been 3+ times on our various trips to Singapore. Delicious wood fired pizza, speedy and friendly service (especially Gori) and they do delivery if you are staying in the area!Will be back again and again :
1
Went to Rosso Vino after finding it on Trip Advisor. So, so disappointed. The guy behind the bar screamed at us while we were still on the footpath. Should have taken this as a warning sign.The boys around the TV screaming at the football should have been another.The wine was fantastic. D had the chicken parmi. It's not Italian food and we should have realised an Italian restaurant in Singapore serving chicken parmi was a bit dodgy. But Trip Advisor reviews said it was a great restaurant so no need to panic. Should have got up and left. My meal was a chicken roll thingo. Apparently my face was a giveaway when it was served. Overcooked and horrible. So, the venue location is great. The wine is great. The food is awful. The blokey noise is awful. The risk is yours
5
The menu offers various choice of dishes. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with his suggestion. Food is highest quality and so yummy.
4
Food was okay, service was kind of slow I would say considering it wasn't a really busy time when we went. But location gets full marks. Works really well if you want to sit down for a while and have conversations.
5
Mmm good food I'm Italian and I can tell it .. back to my home's flavours for a night ..made me dream...good service and lovely atmosphere
5
Thank you Giri, you made our happy hours so special. Excellent service and lots to fun. Recommend it to everyone.
4
Came here for dinner and it was pretty good. It is located next to our hotel so location was good. Staff were friendly. We both had starters and mains only - garlic bread & the melon with proceto for starters. For mains we had the Alfredo pasta and the chicken with cheese and chips. Quick service and food was good
5
This is THE truly Italian restaurent in Singapore! From the food to the very nice atmosphere! Very chill and great service at the sale time. We tried the homemade pasta, was really tasty, the pizza was generous full of cheese!Really recommend this place for the setting by the river and quality of the food. The last and not the least wine is great value ans especially Seiano !Basta this i s a great place...Enjoy
4
Friendly guy behind the bar. Forgot his name tho ... gigi or gilly (I think). Sweet of him to chuck in a free shot of limencello because he realised we just got married! Food was nice and they had a good selection for vegetarians like myself :). The only thing I would say is the food took a long time to come out.
4
Visited mid week and were warmly welcomed and shown directly to a table. The menu is typical Italian but priced above average, although as we were visiting Singapore for the first time everything seemed pricey!Food was decent but not fantastic, no bread served and I had to request water which arrived warm. It was enough to take the edge off an otherwise good night
5
Just came for the 3rd night! Giri bartender, super service. Very friendly, recommended dessert. Had the special main ravioli and the mixed bruchetta plus tirsmisu. All very good. Then Calzone and pannacotta. Again very good. Always attentive. Made me feel like at home! Don't be afraid to ask for anything. So nice to feel comfortable out while far from home! Highly recommend. Would mos def come again next time I'm here on business. Oh and GREAT LOCATION! On the river. Off the street, so quiet but can watch folks stroll by on riverside walk. Great music too
1
I and my wife had our meal at rosso vino restaurant(pepperoni pizza&Caesar salad).it had no taste and too salty and the chicken of caesar salad wasnt cooked enough.the price was too expensive for the quality and they supercharge us over 20% of menu price for service and vat(around 50$).we choose there because of the high rated rank in T.A but we disappointed and dont recommend this restaurant to anyone
5
Giri bartender never fail to welcome you to Rosso Vino with hes captivating skills behind the bar. Friendly & warm service from this team by the river & great italian cuisine.
4
The pizza was very good and fresh. Service was friendly and efficient. The house red wine was just ok but given reasonable S$10/glass price I guess I didn't have high expectations. Nice river views. Will visit again.
5
We enjoyed a wonderful meal staff obliging, food great cosy restaurant can sit outside as well,we stayed in a hotel near but ate here
5
Back after long time and still outstanding service and food.
So far the best Italian in Singapore.
Keep it up Carlo and team! Way to go!
5
very nice waiters there, esspecially Giri is doing there all to be satisfied, get to known as well the owner; Carlo always find some nice words and let you fell like home, thank you all!!!
3
We had lovely garlic bread and calamari to start, my wife's carbonara was good as was my daughter's pizza but I had what was described as stuffed chicken with mozarella...what I was served was a breaded chicken slice that had tomato sauce dumped on top with melted mozarella... neither tasty nor stuffedFor a Â£20 plus main course I was really disappointed... the rest was good...but at $200 for two courses for three people you must try harder with speciality dishes like the chicken. But as people have said the staff were lovely and welcomin
5
We had a late meal here the setting by the river is beautiful, candles on tables very romantic. I had the Grilled Salmon with perfectly cooked vegetables. My husband had the seafood pizza. Large portions served by very friendly waiters. And given a very welcome Limoncello gratis after the meal - we could have almost been in Italy!
5
Located in an expat-heavy area, it's no wonder that the service is so geared to helping everyone feel at home. Giri and Carlo behind the bar both make this a fantastic experience, and the food - the pastas in particularly - are just an added bonus. If you're ever feeling a little homesick (no matter where you're from), stop in and let Giri pour you a glass of wine or one of his signature cocktails
5
My friend and I had our meal at Rosso Vino not only was our meals and desert fantastic so was the service. So two days later we went back again. The barman (sorry forgot your name my friend lost your card with your name on it)who made our Singapore slings incredible. Top marks to all staff the two young ladies in particular who were attentive without prompting. Thanks to all and hope to experience your service again
5
Pizza was delicious, even the crust was good! Staff very attentive, filling up our table water as soon as we needed. The outside tables view was lovely and the atmosphere nice and peaceful. Would highly recommend. (We only stayed in Singapore 4 nights and still ate here twice!
5
Dinner before a show at SRT. We had bruschetta, pasta and some wine. Everything was lovely. Will come back again.
5
Went to Rosso Vino for a glass of vine a quick bite. Very friendly atmosphere and very good food at a decent price level. Nice selection of Italian wines.
5
The food at Rosso Vino was stellar. The calamari was beautifully executed and the pizza (not the thin crust sort though) and pasta were delicious! The pistachio gelato was definitely a highlight and we went back for seconds AFTER our show!
5
I have visited this restaurant twice and each time have been thoroughly impressed with food, service and ambiance.
The food is delicious and tastes authentically Italian, and the staff have been excellent on both occasions.
5
We enjoyed five nights having cocktails beers and banter with the very friendly bar staff. The food was excellent and made our stay in Singapore one to remember. Thank you Giri and Jiggy.
5
Nice waiters, good food and very quiet outdoor terrace.
The enormous choice of gluten-free pasta's is very nice !
5
My friend and I stopped here for an evening meal. The atmosphere was perfect to eat outside. We shared a marguirita pizza and each got a dessert, can't remember its name. It was a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a shot of expresso poured on top, delicious! I had a Tiger beer and she had wine. Prices were reasonable, service was outstanding and friendly. I could easily recommend this restaurant.
5
For a "first night", find-your-feet bolthole, on a first trip to Singapore, this might not have been our most adventurous choice but as it was around the corner from the hotel, and after a long flight, an extremely welcome one. Good for watching the world go by on its scooters. Food excellent value but as everywhere in Singapore, the wine is stunningly expensive really. That, however, seems to be the norm. Good place for a nightcap, too.
4
It's my place of choice for dinner during my 3 weeks business trip in Singapore. The pizza is great. Pasta also good. Cocktail is great. You will enjoy the atmosphere there. It's so relax that you can sit there as long as you wish. No body will disturb you
5
My partner and I visited this bar as it was close to our hotel. We had been out all day walking and was in need of a drink. It is here that we met Giri our bar tender. Words do not describe how amazing this man is he's so friendly professional and a very humble man. He knows his stuff when it comes to cocktails especially margaritas. It was that good we came back again for our last night in Singapore finishing it with an amazing cigar and my new found favourite margarita cocktail with my partner having a whiskey. Giri is an asset to this bar which truely made our stay all that more special. Will be back one day again Giri if I don't steal him to work in Australia first thank you so much
5
Good food but service could be improved! I am not sure if it was because I was there on a Wednesday night and it was quite busy. I will definitely go back though.
5
Great food great staff and beautiful place. Really enjoyed my dinner. Pizza are really good. Will come back for sure
5
Great friendly service from Dinesh and Carlo. The glass was never dry and and was accompanied by great food. Would recommend that you visit if in Singapore just waiting for Clark Quay.
5
Possibly the best food I've had in Singapore. I had the Bruschetta for entree and prosciutto Pizza for main and they were both amazing 👌
5
Awesome time, great food, very kind owner! Would recommend any one seeking good Italian food in Singapore. Friendly staff and a great view whilst eating. Pizzas were great and the seafood pastas are worth a try!
4
My family were there on a Fri night for my daughter's birthday celebration, 7 pax of us. The restaurant is small and cosy. Although service was slow (I believe it is due to the insufficient staff), Tamil, our waiter, was courteous and attentive when he was at our table, Giri was a very friendly barman, calling out cheerful greetings whenever we walked past, which was a lot of times, going back and forth to the toilet or speaking to an available waiter.We enjoyed our Trofie al ragu, Margherita pizza and Filetto. As it was a birthday celebration, the manager graciously allowed us to bring a bottle of wine and a birthday cake. Despite the few staff, Tamil patiently took several photos for us. A nice place for a quiet dinner in a pleasant environment, with warm service
2
I am afraid this was a bit of a miser; the restaurant, whilst nicely located on the SG river, is looking quite tired. The service is poor (5 waiters outside; only one inside) and the food was ok but way too expensive for the quality. I will not be going back. There are loads of much nicer restaurants in that area
5
We only had 3 nights in Singapore but of the 3 dinners, we had, this was the best meal and one of the best Italian meals, outside Italy that I've had. The location is great , just by the quay and just round the corner from the hotel (Park) where we stayed. Service was excellent by a Philippino lady called Evelyn - very attentive and friendly. The food was equally good we just had fettuccine Bolognese, salad and gnocchi but it was really tasty. The prices were not too expensive either. Excellent value for money
4
We found this restaurant very near to our hotel & returned there for dinner on a wet but warm evening. We sat outside but well sheltered, had a super meal, enjoyed very friendly service & a good bottle of wine & almost forgot about the jetlag ! We would certainly recommend a meal here
5
We passed this cafe by chance very late one night and decided to stop in for a quick nightcap - the cocktails, setting and service was so good we stayed longer and enjoyed a few more drinks until closing time. Venue was open air and located right by the river near Clarke Quay, but being a short distance away from the main hustle & bustle it wasn't so noisy and we could talk easily. Thanks to Giri for being so welcoming and for making fabulous cocktails. Our faves were: Strawberry Daiquiri, Strawberry Mojito & Pina Colada. Next time we'll definitely try the venue for a meal
4
Second time I've eaten here. This time had the margarita pizza and my mate had the excellent lasagna. The pizza was a bit too cheesy for me. A margarita should be light on with the cheese. But nevertheless it was all nice again.
4
As from title food is good and even pizza is well cooked . A good restaurant to taste Italian food in Asia . Cost is in the average of Singapore that for sure is not a cheap average . Recommended restaurant .
5
Food was perfect, spaghetti marisco was fantastic, Italians will be asking how they did it. Giri was a great host and insidted if we made a review we had to call him (well the title is self-explanatory) cheers Giri x
5
Giri was unbelievable! Such a great experience. The pizza is amazing. And the people are lovely 😀Go here immediately
3
Well located by the river, but it doesn't really feel Italian. The pizza base wasn't particularly authentic in texture and the orange juice had a very strange taste. No toilets inside, but there are just around the back outside - but it's a weird arrangement.
5
Had a nice late lunch here - was very tasty and the happy hour here last forever ! - 2 for 1 drinks seemed to go on all day !
5
Amazing place to sit and enjoy the beautiful river and experienced great seafood Pizza ever like i had done, that was fabulous. The staff were very nice, friendly and attentive. they went out of their way to support you any time you need their help.
3
A beautiful restaurant, good location, but the food on the dishes are small. Spaguetti carbonara etc.... and other dishes are very small.
Hight price
1
We had dinner with families and friends on Saturday evening. We were very disappointed by this restaurant. The pizza were not enough cooked. My wife took a rosso vino salad which was a shame. The presentation was awful + no condiments. The service was very poorThe only positive is the location for a walk after dinner.We do not recommend this restauran
5
Just walked in as its round the corner from our hotel. The Park. Found us a table outside. We both ordered spaghetti marinara and wine. Excellent pasta as good as you would get in Italy. My husband had a caipirinha which was as good as you would get anywhere. Great atmosphere 100 sing dollars. Will go again on our return trip.
4
The food was very nice and taste like proper italian! We had a special requirement regarding one dish and the chef came out to talk to us personally to make sure everything was ok.
We enjoy de dinner and the place is very nice!
3
The restaurant is just beside the river with a quiet and calm environment. However, we found the place a bit empty for its reputation and food tastes good but not mouth watering.
4
I enjoyed very much the food and atmosphere.Tried the pizza wich was pretty decent.The staff very polite.Would recommend my friend to come.
4
First visit and very impressed with the quality of the food,and good service.
Comprehensive wine list.
4
Server was upset because it's raining outside ☔️☔️🙈🙈
Good food and atmosphere though, we enjoyed the evening
5
Fantastic experience with the Rosso Vino Familia. Entertaining and best service in Singapore. Kamu Bagus! Kia Ora my brothers jiggy jiggy, jay z, amit and your TUMEKE(choice) boss Ariana!! Happy new year! Don't change. Keep feeding people cocktails
2
They charge $25 birthday cake corkage. If you are celebrating birthday there. Pls order cake from them as cake corkage is $25 to sing a birthday song. Food too oily and taste can be improved
5
This place is conveniently located at Robertson Quay providing indoor and outdoor seating. We made a phone reservation, no long waiting on the phone, nice and friendly. Arrived at the scene we got our table and experienced a great and knowledgable service from that Sing-Malay waitress. A great experience which we barely make in Singapore. Food was very delicious and cooked right to the spot. Coffee and wines were great, too. Only the red wine could come not that much chilled. All in all one of the best Italians in SG, prices are usual but ok.
4
What a great find tonight. Gili the bartender is a working dervish and as friendly as you could want someone in his role to be. Menu looks very good so we'll have to return for dinner. My wife tried some ice cream (chocolate and pistachio) which drew nice comments - including a suggestion to pair one of the wines with the chocolate gelato. Thanks for an enjoyable visit.
5
Good vibes and friendly staff always. This place has a big plus for kitchen open till late as all other restaurants in Singapore close kitchen by 10pm. Love the food and the fact it's beside the river what makes it very chill and romantic at the same time.
5
The dinner has been very tasty. The best, the treatment of the boys and girls both in the dining room during dinner and at the bar drinking drinks. I will be back before leaving Singapore and when I return
4
We've been here a couple of times recently and on both occasions we have enjoyed our suppers.
It's a very pleasant setting adjacent to Robertsons Quay, with both indoor and outdoor seating.
Typical Italian menu with varied choices, excellent pizzas and pastas, great service also.
4
Really curtious and friendly staff. Enjoyed our last drinks before going to sleep in our next door hotel.
5
Excellent bartenders- really friendly and helpful. I'm traveling alone for the first time in years and felt like I belong- food is excellent
5
U can get a delicious Pizza and nice glas of red wine (primtivo!) Giri is with his hard in his job and always like to serve and entertain u. Many thanks for the nice and funny evening in your place ! Michael
2
We have been to this restaurant about 3 to 4 times now. I must admit their pastas are good. But i'm afraid we need to be very critical of the chef this time. Firstly, what was you thinking when 1) you served mushroom risotto with tomato 'paste' prawn? Did you skip your flavour combination classes at cullinary school. I may not be an expert in italian cuisine but i can very well tell you what are overwhelming flavours and why they are kept apart. Do you even understand tomatoes? 2) you served shelled prawned wrapped with bacon? Is this practical to you? You expected the person eating this to remove the bacon, de-shell the prawn and then eat it with the bacon or maybe we should eat the bacon and prawn together with the shell? The waiter mentioned that no one has critique the dishes so let it be a first time. Pls remember that they are many reasons why patrons do not critique dishes...sometimes its purely that they dont want to offend the chef or they think he knows best. We are paying you for good quality food and so pls do assume that you can get away with a bad dish. Back to school for you
5
This place has amazing great service and the food is fantastic, when you go to Singapore you have to go to this bar it is honestly the most fun we had and talk to Giri he is amazing and makes great drinks and will make your night. Check it out, it is a place you won't want to walk past.
3
Went for a quick dinner with friends. Service was great, with the staff paying close attention and anticipating all our needs needs. Food was ok, as Italian as you can expect in Singapore. Appetizer platter was a mix of cold cuts you can find locally. Really nothing special , except the high price. We also ordered pizza which turned out to be ok , but nothing spectacular. Same for pasta. The restaurant is on Robertson quay , so plenty of competition close by. Very easy access by taxi who will drop you right beside the restaurant .
5
Hi all....for who read my reports knows that I'm always trying to find and Italian restaurant in all the places that I'm visiting...well...this restaurant has surprised me most because serves pasta al dente!!!Who knows Italian kitchen this is fundamental...and I was really surprised to find this in Singapore!Other surprise ...mortadella with starter!!!Added to these things an Italian owner...(guarantee signal)...and a staff always nice and kind to suggest.Be surprised like me and go here!Ciao to all
4
I went to this restaurant after looking in trip advisor because it was very close to my hotel and i dont regret, the menu was generous whith many plates, all of theme italians and the prices was quite good comparing whith other italians restaurants, the weitress are very kind and the service is quickly, i ate buffala whith ham and spaghetti seafood... well perfect eccept for the spaghettis itself that was not like real italians but they were nice anyway, i am happy whith that experience..
5
Nice restaurant, perfect service, enjoyed the evening.
Sitting outside is great...
Will come back!
Claudia

Visited Singapore and almost every night for two weeks went to Rosso Vino for supper. Great and warm staff, Carlos and team...great Italian food and great atmosphere by river Singapore
5
We visited here for dinner before our flight back to England....lovely setting right on the river. Excellent service, no pressure unlike some places in Singapore. Lovely food and reasonably priced wine.....would definitely recommend
5
Been here with friends. Food is nice and service is really good. Giri is a very cool guy and very energetic in service guest. Keep it up! :)
1
I never wanted to go to Rosso Vino, simply because I don't like the idea of an Italian restaurant with a TV screen showing football. There are scores of sports bars at Robertson Quay, so no need for an Italian restaurant to do that.... but that's just a side note...So my girlfriend finally managed to drag me there, and in total we were there 5 times. Not because it was so good, but because we wanted to give them another chance. Now, after the 5th time - and by far the worst - I really feel compelled to write this review. Not a single time we were there the food was good. In total we had Osso Buco with Risotto Milanese (2 attempts), fish, mushroom risotto, antipasto, soup, salads, tiramisu, wine and espresso - and, except espresso and wine, nothing was up to standard. The risottos were all totally overlooked (until we spoke to the chef), the meat hard and undercooked, all plates very small and overpriced.Then yesterday I was real angry: the antipasto turned out to be 2 slices of mortadella, 4 slices of salami, some plain lettuce, and a slice of cheese. And this at the price of over 30 SGD. I kind of complained, and to make good he brought us - for free - a minestrone and a tiramisu. And than was the final killer: The minestrone looked and tasted like dishwater, the tiramisu was more made of cream rather than mascarpone. Rosso Vino has a massive problem in the kitchen. We will never go again, although we really like the location. Hope this helps them to improve
4
I went there based on the reviews I read. It is nicely located.I liked inside better.Staff was very attentive.Pizza was nice. I had quattro formaggi. It was tasty but surely not as outstanding as it was advertised.I went there before 7pm and luckilly it was happy hour between 4pm-7pm.You can buy one draught beer and get another for free. The price was on the higher side. Without GST and Tip prices for good pizza were 26-28 SGD. Draught beer is 9.50 for glass. I will go there again to try wine as there was a nice selection
4
Restaurant was well placed for us. We had drinks there after a bout of sightseeing. Thought the prices were a bit steep but then in comparison with other establishments there wasn't a lot in it. We had dinner there the next night which was very good. Nothing over the top but good food and the service was good
2
Disappointing, overpriced and the food ranged from adequate to too spicy for the Aglio Olio. The ambiance was nice and lent promise on entry but the food was not the best and with a wealth of good Italian restaurants to choose from in Singapore this is one to give a miss

We had a lovely dinner here and even though we were weary travelers, we all enjoyed our meals and service was very good. We chose this place as it had gluten free options (which has been a little challenging in Singapore) and they had quite a few options of penne and risotto. I chose the mushroom risotto and it was delicious

Went for a birthday dinner celebration but disappointed with the service there. We were not served with the bread and olive oil dip (usual practice in Italian restaurant) and we had to ask for it. Service was very slow, probably due to only 2 staff. We were not given a slice of birthday cake despite being requested twice during reservation. If no birthday cake is to be given free, then at least we needed to be informed. The food was ok only but the ice-cream served w choc lava cake came melting but tiramisu was good. Had higher expectation as was rated highly in Trip advisor.
4
Very conveniently placed to our hotel. Food and service were excellent. Staff moved at high speed when rain and thunderstorm started. Everyone at outside tables were efficiently moved indoors.
5
Loved this place and went back a second time. Sitting outside under trees next to the river, away from the hustle and bustle of Clarke/Boat Quays, we enjoyed great antipasto and some of the best steaks I have had.
4
What smashing grub and a nice place to eat the staff, the atmosphere and ambience was brilliant. The quality of food and service were first class. Would highly recommend.
5
I come here almost every day.
What a great place! Managed by Italians and with an Italian friend which is really uncommon in Singapore.
Thanks Salvo and Chef Alessando!
Keep it up!

Great pizza and arrabiatta! Cute restaurant with good service - about a 15 minute walk from clarke Quay station

We live in the area of this restaurant and thought we'd give it a try on a breezy weekday night. The location is nice, with an open layout by the Singapore River. My friend ordered 2 starters for dinner and I ordered one main with water and a Coke. When the food came we were heavily disappointed by the quantity of the main course (which was the size of a starter), a pasta supposedly with chili (but no chili to be seen or tasted) and a Greek salad which was bland and looked like a 5-year-old had put it together. I asked about the size of the main course, and the waitress said that was their standard portion. She conveyed my message to the chef and she served me some extra pasta, which was kind. Overall we had $75 on our bill without alcohol. When we left I also found out that the seat I had been sitting on was soaked and had probably been left in the rain. This restaurant may we able to continue to exist due to never returning tourists- but as a resident I won't return here any time soon

Went there for my last night in Singapore... fantastic little spot by the water with great prices. Waiter (Greg) was hilarious and very attentive... the lava cake was delish... gnocchi pesto dish was also perfect! Would recommend for a nice terrace dinner and delicious meal :
3
Came here for dinner after reading all the positive reviews. The location is near the river and is lovely and cool in the evening. Service was mediocre but the food was the big disappointment. The gnocchi with pesto was very dense and the pesto lacked flavour. The pan fried spinach lacked salt. We ordered a tenderloin medium rare but this was served medium/medium well. When you $110 for three main courses you certainly deserve better food.
5
Stopped by for a glass of wine by the river, ended up staying the whole evening. The place has a great atmosphere and the waiters are very nice and friendly. Wines and pizza good and although a bit pricey, if you want a place slightly hidden from the busy areas, it's all worth it.
5
After 14 days in Asia we were a little over rice and noodles and were craving a nice Italian dinner. We live in New York City and though we are not picky eaters we are used to high quality food. This place really hit the spot. It's right along the river in Robertson Quay, quiet location but quick walk into the chaos of Clark Quay. We had the eggplant appetizer, lasagna and spaghetti bolognse- all great and home made. Their bread is also made in house and delicious. Good selection of wine. The service was also great. All around would highly recommend for couples or families. Gary, one of the waiters, was also very helpful in making recommendations
4
Only tried the pizza but they were very good. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff. Quiet area of Singapore. Highly recommended
5
Great atmosphere by the lake. We took the 4 cheeses pizza and pesto sauce gnocchi both made for perfection. Pricing is not budget but well worth it.
5
It was that good, we went back, and we were only there for a week!
Excellent Garlic bread and Bruschetta, great steak and spaghetti and very, very nice Amarone!
4
Went here for a week day dinner. Had some aubergine with mozzarella, pizza and wine. Everything from staff service to food was good, pizzas even very good. In short, had a great time, good serivce and good food. Can easily recommend for a casual dinner.
4
Generally the food is pretty good, and prices are very reasonable considering Singapore. Definitely should be tried.
1
It was a Sunday evening. Me and my husband walked up to the restaurant. We got a nice table.The waitress was very polite. We ordered our drink which was OK.We the ordered our Pizza and a fish dish. The Pizza had no flavour, no cheese and few scattered toppings. It was a small Pizza which is normally cut into four pieces but we were told that it is a eight slice Pizza.When we told them that there was no cheese and toppings the owner who was an Italian told us thats what we get.My husbands fish wa under cooked and so we had to send it back to get it cooked.The owner did give a 10% discount on the fish but the food itself was shocking. It was an overpriced restaurant for the quality of food served
3
Dined here twice and I enjoyed the first time better than the second. The music outside was too loud and not really suited to Italian restaurant. Tagliatelle bolognaise was good, first time round, but Tuna salad was very simple and unimaginative. My husband's pizza was ok but food generally didn't overwhelm us. Prosecco was nice
4
Great restaurant with nostalgic melodies by frank and dean plus plus which was delightful to have our pasta dishes to. The food is especially good and try to get there early evening as the sun is setting in Singapore. Ambiance and staff is good and prices okay. Around Â£30 a head and we had three beers, tasty pizzas and delicious Italian ice cream. This restaurant was near our hotel The Park hotel Clarke quay so very convenient. There are tables and chairs outside restaurant and pram easily facilitated. Relax and people watch at the quayside in very amiable atmosphere.
5
Delighted to find a good range of gluten free pasta dishes. Had the Penne Bolognaise, which did not disappoint. Delicious and to the high Italian standard. Extremely helpful waiter who understood allergies and checked with chef for me. Less than 5 minutes walk from the noisier and more expensive Clarke Quay waterside restaurants. A-rated hygiene cert. Excellent food and service. Would highly recommend
5
Best service in 17 countries and a special thank you to Giri! He's my new favorite human. A sincere pleasure to meet this gentleman. The rest of the staff are equally on par. I've visited this establishment everyday of my holiday and intend on doing so until I leave this beautiful place. Thank you Giri and all of my new friends at Rosso Vino. Chow!
4
Had spaghetti pomodoro with a beer - too hot for red wine. Service was attentive and friendly and the walkway location was a great view.
5
I have visited Rosso Vino once during my holiday.
Has been an amazing experience, great food and service and beautiful setting by the river.
Highly recommended!
5
The food was excellent, freshly prepared and served and there are gluten free options for people like me with a wheat intolerance.
The service was also very good and the waiter was attentive but not over the top.
We would definitely recommend this reastaurant
5
great homemade pasta!!! friendly staff and atmosphere. will return on next visit. like the location by riverside at Robertson Quay
2
We went to try out this restaurant for dinner in view of good review from tripadvisor.The ambiance was okay but I would say nothing special. The service there was good.We actually had quite some expectation before we went there but its a disappointment. The food there were rather plain and tasteless for us. We ordered pasta aglio olio and carbonara. (These are the common Italian pastas, we believe that a good Italian cuisine should serve a good basic pasta). The carbonara is not creamy and cheesy enough and I didn't taste anything other than the spiciness in aglio olio.The price is considered mid-range but in view of the food, I would say its not worth it.To be fair to the restaurant, I have to mention that I am from Penang with a 'resistant' taste bud. If you been to Penang before and you like the food there with strong flavor then the food here will definitely be plain for you.But if you like something lighter then you can have a try.Anyway I think taste is very subjective and personal. This is my personal comment and it shouldn't stop you from trying out there
4
During a recent stay over in Singapore dined at Rosso Vino two consecutive evenings. Restaurant in a great location on the Quay for people watching. Meals were great a little expensive but it is Singapore. The staff at Rosso Vino were attentive and service was very good. Would recommend
5
Rosso Vino is an Italian restaurant with excellent food and excellent service. The atmosphere is Italian, and you can chose to sit close to the river or indoors with air condition.They even know what gluten is, and serve some glutenfri pasta dishes. No one else in Singapore seems to know anything about gluten. We ate here many days, and it became our favorite restaurant during our visit, so we will definitely come back if we visit Singapore again
4
My bf & I originally wanted to be at another restaurant but it was full. We chanced upon Rosso Vino, it was also almost full but we were lucky to get seats at the bar.The bartender that night was warm & friendly, food was good, drinks are reasonably priced, and ambiance and atmosphere were pretty chill. We'll definitely be back
3
Smallish restaurant on the water at Clarke Quay, reviews seemed good but I was disappointed. The food had little taste and the spaghetti marinara had limited seafood in the dish, entrees were ok but not great. Wine list was good with choices from many countries but a little expensive I thought. I won't be rushing back
1
We went there for a late night pizza. It was a humid night and so I basically just wanted an ice cold water to go along with the pizza, while my bf ordered a cider. The Indian waiter seemed to be disappointed that I just ordered a plain water, and annoyingly pushed the cocktails that I obviously didn't want to have that night. I courteously said no, yet he gave me this reaction that pissed me off.Our pizza order came, and AGAIN he stressed out the plain water that I ordered! What is the the big deal about it?!! It's not like I didn't order anything else at all.Please teach your waiters some manners, the pizza was nice indeed but my mood was totally ruined by one of your waiters
5
What a spectacular end to an amazing vacation! The food was incredibly good and the stuff extremely professional, I hope I'll get the chance to come back soon and eat again the amazing Lava Cake!
5
I totally loved this place, the restaurant itself looks great and the food is just awesome, this is by far the best Italian restaurant in Singapore!! The food is high-quality, and the service is really nice. Can't wait to go back there!
4
If you are looking for a quiet meal away from the hustle and bustle of Clarke Quay, either indoor or outdoor, then this is great.
Friendly service and good food, mid-range cost but more upper end Italian restaurant.
5
good service and a good drink. Outdoor places available. A good place to have a dinner or lunch, or just a drink
5
Having made dinner arrangements elsewhere, in order to meet a couple of different friends, we only visited Rosso Vino for some drinks. But we were welcomed so warmly! Gino was so kind to us (and we saw him being just as welcoming to others) that we came back three times in three days. Drinks are priced appropriately for a front row seat at Robinson Quay. Good people watching and the staff are much more personable than any I've met in Singapore. Oh and the name is perfectly good Italian; if you know what it really means, you'll be even more warmly received! Great place, adorable staff. See you soon. Philip
5
The perfect place to celebrate my anniversary! The place is amazing and the view is lovely!I loved the food real made in Italy.I highly recommend this place because is really nice and in particulary the food is amazing! Can't wait to came back and eat proper italian food
5
This is right at the foot of Park Hotel, Clarke Quay....I would say a great place if you are a vegetarian and are simply looking to have some awesome drinks followed with dinner.What I Had ?Pasta with portion of Garlic BreadPersonal PizzaThe taste was great, service was prompt and quick.The staff was very corteous and they ensured if the preparation was to the person's liking and one is comfortably seated.This is a little away from Clarke Quay hustle...Super recommend
1
The waiter promised drinks at happy hour prices (2 for 1). My wife paid the bill and later I saw that he lied. I was mugged off. The food is mediocre. Avoid this rip off place. Pizza hut is way better and decent. Waiter - shame on you !!
4
We had lunch here one day on returning to our hotel across the road. A simple burger each and a glass of wine sat outside watching the world go by. The food was good,tasty and well cooked. A pleasant hour before crossing the road to our hotel
4
We ended up at this place after our meal near by. We were looking for an outdoor setting to enjoy good wine and good people watching. This was a great combo. We also ended up ordering panna cotta and gelato for desserts. They came nicely decorated and tasted good also. :) the wine we selected was also nice and not too horrible expansive in relative terms of course.The reason I am opted out for 4 stars cuz of the fact that we didn't not have dinner here. So maybe next time. If we come in this area again for a night out, we will sure come back and visit.
5
Very good food and the service was excellent. Couldn't fault and will return Location is near river and sitting outside added to the experience.
5
It's not often that you get attentive and good-natured service, great food and wine in a pleasant location all at the same place.
3
Just ok in my view-- ok food, average service, reasonable prices... Great location. Might need to try one more time-- but unremarkable this time
4
On our way to Rome we tried this place, great Italian wines, excellent service, beautiful spot, food was good, not sensational but good. Expensive but classy.
5
Sunday evening visit - food excellent, ambience relaxing, noise levels just right, service standard way above average. What more do you need to know?
1
I ordered this margharita pizza by ubereats.. And when I ate it, I just feel the pizza was not good.. After I continue eating and It started to taste bitter, then I flipped the pizza and I knew why, it's burnt and they still serve or sent it to me
3
Great spot, especially outside. However...... It's way over priced for what you get. Pizza was ok but they use can/jar mushrooms and olives???The over priced (16 bucks!!!) Greek salad was all lettuce with a tiny sprinkling of fetta and more tasteless jar olives.Very disappointed actually especially after reading the great reviews. Not an great Italian restaurant. If they slashed the prices then I could forgive
5
I was at the nearby Robertson Quay Hotel for few days, and I had the pleasure to have few meals at Rosso Vino. Nothing to complain about. Food was excellent, I had pizza, gnocchi, penne and tagliere di formaggi. I did try their minestrone as well, I couldn't find anything to complain about. Good selection of wines and beer, smoker's friendly, pricey - yes - but you pay the quality. I usually go for local food when I travel, but I was with my father, who was terminally ill and just willing to eat Italian food (we're Italians after all...), he was extremely difficult to please in terms of food but he was also very happy with anything he had there. Thanks to the waiters and the management for assisting him while I was busy around and couldn't be with him, they did a great job to make hist stay a pleasant one
5
For anyone who enjoys quality food, flavoursome, rich pasta cooked to perfection everytime without incidence (always slightly aldente) and warm, welcoming device with a legit smile all night long take a trip to vino rosso. As a solo traveller I wondered how this resteraunt would accommodate me alone and was more than pleasantly surprised with how friendly the staff and owners where, so much so I made a habit of visiting Vino Rosso during my stay in Singapore. Try out the vegetarian options such as the spaghetti pomodoro it had me coming back for more. Thank you so much Emilina, Jiggi, Rosa and the rest of the crew you made my stay a pleasure. See you all soon. Luke
4
In Singapore solo for a work trip and was walking down the river. Reviews were good and I was feeling some wine, so stopped in for dinner. Definitely a good spot. Food was good, not amazing as some great Italian places around the world can be, but it was very good. Good wines, but great service. Staff very friendly and helpful. Haven't tried many places around the Quays, but would bet they have some of the better food/service/wine.Would come back
5
Service - TOP notch
Food - never fails (COD is fantastic, cheese board offer really good)
Location - set on the river bank
Price - not cheap but good value for Singers
Be there before 7 for 1f1 drinks and good cheese platter offer.
5
Stumbled on this restaurant by accident while taking shelter from the rain. So glad we did as we enjoyed several evenings of fun in this cosy haven. Bar staff were excellent. Great service, great food.
4
I go there often with my family and take standard meals: pasta, pizza, anti pasti and gelato. We have never been disappointed by the service nor the quality of the food: excellent. It is right next to the river and has a bit of louge atmosphere. Highly recommende

We accidentally discovered Rosso Vino walking along Clark Quay, trying to select a decent restaurant from the dozens along the riverbank. We were not disappointed: the food was superb, the wine excellent, the service flawless and friendly, and the price — brace yourself — was actually very reasonable. You won't go wrong giving Rosso Vino a try.The restaurant is a smaller establishment, wrapped around the corner of a building just northwest of the Clemenceau Bridge over the Singapore River. It is five bridges up from the Marina, which makes it an easy walk in the cool of the evening. I have no data about parking and such; walking is so easy you simply must do it.From the broad tree-lined walkway along the river, the Rosso Vino stands out from the other restaurants in the area with it's sophisticated look and elegant style. The bar is handsome, the seating comfortable and the trees and brick walkway make you feel like you're strolling along the Pontaccio in Milan. This restaurant features not neon lighting or flashing signs; its a demure but sophisticated lady who expects you will notice her without overt flirtations on her part.The service was excellent, absolutely top-drawer in every way. Tiny example: the chianti was slightly chilled, but not cold. The wine server opened the wine, held the bottle from the base, rotated the bottle so you could read the label and poured without spilling a drop. Bravo! Wine the way it is supposed to be served.(By the way, the restaurant ONLY features Italian wines and they are very reasonably priced; about half of the prices in other restaurants in the area.)We ordered a cluster of starters to share and then pastas for our dinners; everything came very gracefully, tastefully and properly cooked. But the best part of the dinner, without exception, was the young lady who was our server. I won't put her name here, to protect her privacy, but she and her team did an outstanding job and are to be complimented. Boss, give that girl a raise -- she did a super job and made us feel very welcome.After dinner, our server brought "on the house" four glasses of limoncello, a delightfully cooling southern Italian drink. It was a perfect topping to a delightful evening.Dinner for four people was about SIN$450, which isn't bad for two bottles of wine in Singapore. The Restaurante Rosso Vino comes with Pilot Mike's personal guarantee of satisfaction: you will enjoy your dinner or I'll fly back to Singapore and eat here again. Buon appetito
5
We ate here in February 2016 and I am sorry that it has taken me so long to write this review as this is a great place to eat . It is in a good position on Robertson Quay . The service was good and the food was excellent. It was more expensive than other places we tried in Singapore but worth it for a special meal out 
2
Can't believe how this place has so many good reviews. The pizza was horrible, very unpalatable, like many of those really bad pizzas you get in Singapore. The lasagne was ok, but I wouldn't rush back. Bella pizza which is literally across the road is miles better all round, and sells proper pizza. I don't know how this place keeps getting custom ahead of it
5
As we were looking for a place to eat and it was only 1130am, we chanced upon Rosso Vino just along the riverside and was pleased it opens as early as 1130am. Bartender was welcoming and sat us down to our desired table. Service was smooth and welcoming. Buratta, Ravioli and Carbonara was super delicious that we had to order 2 Ravioli for takeaway before we left. Definitely a place for good Italian cuisine. Though it might be quite a distance away from the main road, it's worth the walk for a place with a good view and good food
5
We ate here one evening, wonderful to be sitting out watching boats go by, in the nightlight, warm, friendly, prompt service, Wonderful selection of Italian food, pastas just superb (you must try the gnocchi!) and excellent wine list (lots of Italian wines to choose from)You could have been in Venice - the atmosphere, food, setting, music, transported us there!If you want Italian at it's best you can't go past this
5
We ate here twice on our recent stay in Singapore and found it a great dining experience. Very friendly and good service. The calamari and pasta dishes are excellent. We had a couple of cocktails which were a little pricy but Singapore is not cheap. We were more than happy to pay for good service and great food.The location here is fabulous, very leafy right next to the river. Would definitely return
4
All the elements are here:Riverside location;Romantic setting;Friendly & amenable staff;Good service & appropriate wait times for A La Carte dining;Extensive food & drinks menu;Value for money.I would not call Rosso Vino cheap but, the value is very good for what you get. My friend and I arrived for a 7.30 pm booking and had been put outside. The night was a little too muggy so, we were readily moved inside upon request.The woman that waited on us had an excellent understanding of the menu.Portions were just right and, after an entree & main, I had no room for anything but coffee
5
I went to this restaurant last September and loved it, so returned and was not disappointed!! Food excellent, service great too.
4
Great to be able to sit outside by the river, good selection of dishes on offer with decent wines to choose from, friendly staff make the experience very pleasant.
4
Decided to grab dinner here on a Friday night before going out for drinks-- amazing authentic Italian grub! Garlic bread was great, and the homemade pastas were incredible! Will definitely tell our friends whenever they are here in Singapore.
5
Very romantic place, have a table at the river walk in Robertson Quay. The pasta is homemeade and was great. A three course menu with a bottle of wine was about 150SGD. The service was excellent.
3
Having just arrived in Singapore for a family holiday and with tired kids in tow...we opted for convenience.Decor & ambience is lovely by the river side at Robertson Quay.Service was friendly & unobtrusive.Menu looked the goods including pizza and home-made pasta.We opted for a pizza, home-made fettuccine, home-made lasagna, & salmon spaghetti. Meals were tasty but portion sizes were a bit smaller than expected (excluding the pizza which was a good size).Prices were expensive in our opinion...S $5 for a coke is not cheap and average meal price was +/- S $25 which for pasta is certainly not cheap. Total bill was S $137.Overall a lovely meal in pleasant surroundings...but not somewhere we'd be in a hurry to re-visit. I'm sure there are equally nice meals here in Singapore which cost a lot less! So a rating of Average in our opinion is fair
4
Was introduced and highly recommended by my sis in law for her birthday celeb. We were blown away with the delicious Italian cuisines we ordered from the menu. The staffs were polite and food served were of good portion & really nice. Food pics available on my IG profile @Poshberriesweet. Will be back there again soon. Cheers
5
Found this place by accident and just dropped in one evening. Having sampled a freshly made pizza (I know, really daring), we consumed two wonderful bottles of Pinot Grigio, which, in the balmy evening heat, alongside the river, with the hum of conversation from the other punters, this was a pleasant way to while away the hours
5
Very friendly service. This restaurant is located by the Singapore river with a nice outdoor seating area. Staff are very welcoming with friendly service keen to make sure you are well looked after. Food is authentic, fresh and clearly made to order. Portion sizes are very good (too big for me). Price is as expected and given the size offers good value for money. A nice wine list too
4
when Clarke Quay is too noise, welcome to Rosso Vino, just 5 min walk upstream.Greec salad is fresh, rich, nice. Efficient waiters and usually no waiting, a great place to eat outside, watching joggers, e-bikes and the river. Some nice background music, a relaxing place. Will visit again.Not cheap, this is Singapore ;-
3
We ate here and I felt like authentic Italian pepperoni pizza and certainly got it. Crust was delicious, just what I was craving. My wife felt like steak, and was very disappointed. Very fatty and small considering the price. The potato bake was quite tasteless too. We quite often when travelling will find a restaurant we go to the first night and end up returning a few times if the food is fantastic, unfortunately after eating here our first night in Singapore we are now still looking tonight for a great place to eat
4
went on holiday last week and popped by in this little place.
nice and clean, anytime again if i am around.
4
We booked here for Valentines Night. The food was very good and prices quite reasonable for Singapore, which tends to be very expensive to eat in restaurants. Staff looked after us well and we had an enjoyable evening.
3
Nice location. Near the river and the area is not crowded with pedestrians. Food is ok and the wine is pricey
5
Amazing ambiance, very friendly staff and excellent value for money. The burrata is very tasty and possible to watch football while you are eating
5
Stopped here reroute to Australia and New Zealand.
Only place we could get a decent meal at 10.45 at night.
Had the fresh pasta which was amazing accompanied by exchange excellent bottle of Chianti.
Highly recommended for food and service.
4
The food was good and it's a nice place along the river, but the most important thing is the very nice and helpful staff, that made our visit so pleasant and joyful! I'd go there again.
5
Its recommended to come here! The food is amazing and its so italian! The Serivce is good and also amazing! Its the best italian food i ever taste in singapore! :)
4
Situated in a nice location by the river we ate dinner at Rosso Vino on a Sunday night.Food was excellent and price is reasonable for Singapore. We both had an entree, pasta for our mains, a couple of cocktails and a drink each during happy hour and the total bill was $115 SGD. Drinks do get much pricey after happy hour so if budget is a concern make sure you have dinner earlier if you want the cheaper drinks
4
We went twice - it was about a 15 minute walk from our hotel - the Park Regis. Clarke Quay is much closer but busy and noisy and more expensive. Very good ambience, good and very friendly service by the mostly Italian crew. Price is reasonable by Singapore standards, I particularly enjoyed the "Il Ponto" Tuscan red at $65 - it's my style very full-bodied more like a S.Italian wine. The food I regret to say is only average. My g/f had Grilled Salmon was OK but the base/guarnacion of zucchini and black olives was both inappropriate and tasteless. I had the Sirloin steak (medium rare) which was tasty but only came with a kind of potato cake. Ordered a side-dish - spinach, was very good, but $10 as are the other side-dishes. Next evening we returned and shared a Pizza Quatro Formaggi which was good if you like puffy-edge "Neapolitan-style" pizzas as I do, although it was less tasty than I expected. We shared a dessert - I can't remember the name - a kind of pastry cone filled with chocolate, etc - it came with 2 spoons but the pastry was very tough and (IMO) sort of stale ---- you could never eat it with spoons. I picked it up and took a bite but was not nice. Our waiter offered us alternatives, none of which appealed, so he took it off the bill without any rancour. All considered this is a very nice and well-run restaurant which I recommend
3
3 rating is certainly harsh but a 4 would have been excessive.The food is Ok - I had linguine with crab meat - but nothing to be crazy about.The staff is really friendlyThe location in Robertson Quay is quite good (much more quiet than Clarke or Boat).A bit pricey but you are in SingaporeWe were only 2 tables on a Friday for lunch..
5
Excellent Italian restaurant close to Clarke Quay riverside, wide choice of menu friendly attentive staff. Highly recommended.
5
I enjoyed very much the food and atmosphere. The dinner was tastefull, prices are acceptable and the staff is really kind and helpful.
4
We found this delightful restaurant to be excellent value and with great staff. I thought everything in Singapore was expensive, but this proved otherwise.
5
Stopped here a couple of times for a refreshing pint of Tiger Beer during happy hour 2 for 1. Our waitress Rossa was very friendly and helpful. Tried the pizza with anchovies which was pretty decent. Nice location and atmosphere.
Al
5
A quiet , relaxing atmosphere by the river, just a few minutes walk from the noisy- Clarke key, Here you can talk without shouting, relaxing background music- good food and great service
5
Very Good Food, Excellent Service, Amarone Wine for 99SGD or 19 per glass very price worth. Calmer surrounding with river view close to our hotel Holiday Inn Atrium.
5
A great place to relax & good staff. The food is very nice. Nice wine as well. Peaceful place to eat and drink. Would recommend my friends to come.
5
Staying next door at the Park Hotel. Had a dinner meal here on our second last night in Singas. We both decided to skip entrÃ©e as wanted to have room for desserts. My wife enjoyed a crab/prawn linguine which she thought was divine . I had the Marinara which was also as good. Desserts - pannacotta & tira ma Su - awesome ! Great ambience and location. Definitely a winner if chasing good Italian food. Can not forget the service - faultless ! Highly recommended
5
OK we only had a starter, but it was lovely, I can only guess that it is representative of the wider menu. The staff were polite, the menu varied. It is tucked a bit off the main track, but well worth the effort to find it
4
Here in Rosso Vino, the chef, Aldo provides his customers with the best possible food, served quickly and with the greatest possible attention to details. ( Do check out their raviolis which are made from scratch). Not only they serve quality food, the service of their staff, esp Rosa impresses me. If you are looking for a nice quiet place to chill out and nothing too harsh on your pocket, this may probably an option.
4
Menu choices were excellent - our choice of lasagne & a prawn pesto dish were both superb. Our wine & aircon could have been colder.
1
We were looking forward to eating at this Italian restaurant as it looked very nice from the outside. However, our pizza was greasy, service was terrible and the cost expensive for what we ate.
5
Located along the river is an authentic italian restaurant. Thanks Aldo for the amazing food and thanks Salvo for the wonderful service. See you soon!

This hard for me to score. The quality of meat that using in this place were very good. But food we ordered was plain. My char grill salmon quality was very good. It would be better if it marinade in seasoning a few hours before cooking. The sauce that cam with black olive and Zucchini also tasteless. My hubby ordered beef salami Pizza. The beef salami was very good quality but again doesn't have enough flavor on the sauce. The dough was quite thick. Caprese : Buffalo mozzarella with slide tomatoes top with a few leaf of basil. This mozzarella doesn't have much flavor. I had a better Caprese elsewhere plenty of time. It's simply dish. But also require the right buffalo mozzarella to use. Bottle of Chianti Classico Tolaini was nice. Well kept in right temperature. It was smooth, full body and fruity. Gelato Hazelnut was quite good. Complementary bread basket put down without any balsamic and olive oil provides. When we ask for one of the gentleman pouring oil on my husband plate and spray a tiny bit of balsamic on top. Then, those 2 bottles gone. As a foodies, I been visited countless Italian restaurants never experienced that no olive oil and balsamic on the table before, never and ever. After I saw those gentleman using his hand covering balsamic spray I completely lost my appetite. So, I didn't try those bread which I usually like it when I went to Italian restaurant. This spray balsamic and using hand to protecting spills should stop for hygienic reason. At least provides small bottle of olive oil and balsamic on table. The service by the lady was very tough on the edge. She had a rough spoken tone.I gave it a 4 because of quality of food and drink that I have got last night. If the restaurant could adding more flavor on food, service more pleasant with soft spoken waitress and provides olive oil and balsamic on table I would be return. The price was fair for all those we ordered only 194 S$Ambiance indoor was nice for a couple or even a business dinner. Outdoor table look over the river will be good if it not a humid night.

Great time, Carlo was just a great professional, excellent advise, warm and nice person. Food perfect, nice tune in the air, romantic terrace and nice cigar cave. We spent twice diner, each was a very good time there. Can I say, probably my favorite restaurant in Singapore. Well done
5
We loved this, was our local while staying in Clarke Quay. First time we had a Singapore sling was here so very memorable, and you can't just have one. Food was excellent, The staff were so very friendly and good fun, Great setting. Would definitely recommend.
5
really romantic on that night. we eat the delicious crab pasta & pizza. the price is ok. I found that they always do offer & really full every night. but on Sunday is not so packed. a lot of people like to sit outside (can see the river). we choose to sit indoors with aircond. they played lovely music. so, me & husband can enjoy our date night because nobody sit inside. its like my husband books whole place. heh

Located just off Clarke Quay next door to Park Hotel on the riverside. We were going for a drink on the way to CQ but the staff were friendly, genuinely Italian/Sicilian and rain was threatening! We were going to eat outside, but as the rain started, they moved us indoors. The food was good, the service excellent and friendly and would go back
4
Now this place is a little gem. After reading the TA advice we headed over here and were pleasantly surprised by the location and venue. The staff were vreat. The menu is varied and reasonably priced although the alcohol price is not easy on the pocket !!!The food itself is generous and really good tasting. We had a great overall experience here
4
We came here with a group of 6 and the place was full. The staff were great however and just asked us to wait and grab a drink and a table would be available shortly which it was. It's set right on the quay side near a bridge so not easy to find. Best is to sit outside (ideally book!). We had a pasta and a pizza and both were fantastic and authentic. We also ordered some squid rings and a salad plus a round of drinks and the manager didn't right any of it down (we also changed the order mid order to complicate matters further) yet the waiter remembered everything perfectly - quite a party trick. Would probably give it 4.5 but no such option :-
4
Restaurant around the corner from our hotel. Called in for drinks and desserts. Nice end to a busy day in singapore. Fun place. Great food and engaging staff!!
4
Great place to sit down for some decent drinks and good cigars. Service is very good! Only tried the pizzas, quite ok but could be more spicy when it listed as spicy.
3
A good alternative to hotel dining; good menu and outside or inside tables. Prices similar to Australia and food quality good.
5
we were staying at park hotel a couple of minutes away so went for evening meal.Very tasty lasagna and a nice bottle of red wine.A nice relaxing atmosphere by the river.
4
After an extended trip where we tried to eat nothing but local cuisine we were “rendanged out.” We noticed this place while wandering through Robertson Quay on the way back to our hotel. A quick chick on TA showed that it was well reviewed so we decided to eat dinner there……..good choice. The menu had a large swath of the Italian favorites you would expect, complimented by a good source of fresh seafood. We started with a Bufala mozzarella/prociutto appetizer and shared a mushroom/prawn risotto as the primi piatti. The dishes were well prepared and the tastes were familiar and delicious. A reasonably priced Nero D’Avola accompanied the meal, pairing nicely with the risotto. Sharing the risooto allowed for dessert and we opted for the panacotta. The waiter surprised us with post-dessert digestifs (Limoncello). All-in-all a very good meal in a nice location along the quay, with very good waitstaff (thanks Iggy). Recommended
5
Made a reservation via the phone tonite and they very kindly helped me to arrange a table indoors that could fit my daughter's pram. At the restaurant, the dinner service was prompt and very polite. Waitress even brought us a pitcher of ice water without being asked. The pizzas were nicely done and the mash potatoes (though just a side) were smooth and creamy. We had the lava cake for dessert and it was done just right with rich chocolate oozing out once the cake was cut. All in all, a great experience at a restaurant with a good location and ample parking nearby.
4
Not easy to come across good service in Singapore which is paired with equally good food. Rosso Vino is just that... We ordered: -Bruschetta al Salmone to share-Caprese to share -White pizza with beef carpaccio to share -We had Cannoli & lava cake for dessert Total price: S$90 (which also included a bottle of sparkling water & two little coffees). Food was well presented, portion copious, and the taste was great. We are out on the terrace which is lovely. They have relaxing music playing and you are sitting along the river. People watching fully available too. Overall great experience! Grazie Salvatore Adald
5
We were with a couple of friends and we had a wonderful dinner. The food is very good ( I suggest Burrata). Here you can have a real Italian food. The service is excellent and the the staff is very friendly I strongly suggest to go here
5
Its my first time here with my friend and we got a real good service from the waitress, Rosalinda and the general manager. The lava cake is a must try!!!! We even had 2 servings as it was so good!!! Would definitely love to come again! Thumbs up to Salvatore!! :
5
Just a short stroll from the hubbub of Clarke Quay, this delightful and relaxing restaurant on Robertson Quay became our little oasis during a recent stay in Singapore. Good authentic Italian food (the chef is Italian) and ample al fresco seating overlooking the river. Stop by for a full meal, a cheese platter, or simply to enjoy a glass of wine or a cocktail or two...but the real star(s) of this bar and restaurant are the very welcoming and charming staff - unfailingly polite and friendly and they each clearly enjoy providing great service as a well oiled team. Special mention must be made of the lovely Rosa, who mixes and shakes the best and meanest Singapore Sling on the island - trust me, we've tried plenty! Enjoy
4
We were staying at the Park Hotel and this restaurant was a two minute walk so wonderful and handy. The food was lovely and staff were very friendly the the outllook accross the river is a nice back drip
5
excellent Italian food, and impeccable service :) was here for our first night in singapore, and had to come back a second time, during our 5day stay in Singapore :)
5
A much quieter location along the riverfront compared to Clarke Quay.
Homemade gnocchi that melts in your mouth with a glass of Seiano red.
The best latte despite the $6.80 price but that's normal in Singapore.
4
Called in here on our first night in Singapore. Lovely location, excellent service and very nice food. We had the lasagne which was well presented and tasted lovely and was not bad value. Well worth a visit.
5
A year has passed since our last visit and thankfully the food hasn't changed. First class service from everyone. The best calzone pizza outside Italy. If you are in Singapore rosso vino should be on your list of places to visit.
5
What can be better than dining on excellent Italian dishes sitting along side of the Singapore River? Nothing! Excellent food quality with an outstanding wait staff. Ambience that best represents S'pore!
5
Tried rosso vino's cod fish dish. Chef Aldo really live up to his name for making delicious food here. It was absolutely delicious. Fish was cooked to perfection - crispy on the outside and pearly white on the inside. The chopped vegetables in the dish has a delightful tangy flavour which balances the dish very well. Ended with pistachio gelato dessert and it was absolutely heavenly.Service was attentive prompt and fast. Highly recommend.
4
During a stay at a nearby hotel I dropped by here quite often earlier this year, for both, food and drinks. The restaurant has a great choice, really enjoyable. It is also open until late, often stopped here while coming back from Clarke Quay. If you stay nearby you should not miss it.
5
My husband and I had a meal here on our last night in Singapore. We chose it as it was very close to our hotel and had excellent reviews on trip advisor.The service was excellent especially from the Indonesian barman who's name I didn't catch. The menu selection was very good and the food delicious. We'd definitely go back.
3
Nice place by the riverside. Service is very friendly and attentive (restaurant was almost empty as we visited during the F1 race). Pizza is ok, clearly not as good as a proper Italian pizza and probably not the best in town. Will try a different Italian eatery next time
5
The lady behind the bar is the Mojito angel! Tasty and nice. I absolutely love it! Will definitely go again. Five stars
5
We had one of the best Italian meals we have tasted for a long time here. The food & service were excellent in relaxed surroundings. Would certainly recommend if you like Italian food
2
No frisk Italian restaurant, food is actually lower than usual Italian restaurant. Main highlight is the location.
Thing to try : espresso
Thing to avoid : the (so-called Sicilian) chocolate dessert
4
Made a booking for 14 people for a colleagues birthday. The restaurant was busy, but they were very attentive and really looked after us. The food was great, we all ordered individually, but everything turned up at the same time, with no mistakes. The team loved it and they even made a birthday cake. Really enjouable evening
3
Well situated, just off the bustle of Clarke Quay and quite overlooking the river. the food is average but expensive drinks and when they don't bring the change it becomes very expensive. my advice is to check the bill and ensure they bring the change back.
5
my wife and I took a relative from New Zealand to Rosso Vino tonight and were pleasantly impressed.The gentleman serving us, Jinesh (sp?) was very helpful and very attentative throughout our dining experience without being intrusive.The three of us had very different meals.... Pizza, Ravioli and Chicken Parmagianna. All 3 meals were nicely presented and we all have great reviews on the food.A big plus was, unlike many restaurants in Singapore, all 3 meals were served at the same time.Overall a great dining experience. The food and the service was far better than some very upmarket restaurants we have recently been to.Also a great ambience in the restaurant.We will definitely be repeat customers
4
I went there with some friends to have I nice dinner. I have been eating some nice fish filled the others went for pizza, that also looked very nice.A few bottles of wine , eating ,looking at people walking by not a bad evening. A nice and helpful service and no problem for them to split the bill for us.Good value for your money
3
Italian restaurant on Clarke Quay where we had the tastiest meal so far on our stay (4 days admittedly all western restaurants). Service is good, wine was good, pasta and side dishes better than average the only reason it doesn't rate better is that you're going to pay 40 quid each for a bowl of pasta and share a bottle of wine
4
Rosso Vino offers a range of antipasti (bruschetta, caprese, burrata and cheese/cold cuts), pasta and pizza along with a few meat and seafood dishes. I had the mixed antipasti (half cheese board, half meat , which you can ask for especially) which was good with nice coppa, salumi, proscuitto, mortadella, and a selection of cheeses - including pecorino and a dulce du leche, along with a little bit of tomato and pesto bruschetta, enough for 2 as a starter. Very nice and good quality overall. For a main i took a special off the menu - a gnocchi with cauliflower, salsiccia and sundried tomato. The salsiccia was a nice addition, but there wasn't much going on with the sauce. They have a range of cocktails, wines by the glass and beer. The Umbrian sauvignon blend was quite good overall. Value is ok, for two courses and two glasses of wine you should expect about 70 SGD
5
The pizza is great, so is the pasta, the service is excellent (and italian!), and the terrace by the river is very nice. What else should I ask for ? One of my favorite italian restaurant in Singapore despite a price quiet high for a pizza...
4
The homemade pasta of Alfredo and gnocchi was excellent . Service was very good and relaxed . Price was on par with other restaurants along the river .
4
Food and service was fabulous. Such a lovely setting on the Singapore River. Waiter served complimentary limoncello...reminded us of Amalfi.
3
Visited for an early dinner and got a nice table outside with a view of the river. The food was very tasty, but the service was a bit lukewarm, which spoiled the evening.
5
Great Italian food and most italian wines and alcohols were available, price = to Perth prices then add on 17% tax on the River. Everywhere was expensive to eat, unless you go to the Street markets.
4
Great restaurant with good outdoor seating area, lovely staff and reasonable prices. The calzone was awesome.
Short walk down the water from Clarke Quay or Boat Quay but with more tolerable prices.
5
Always greeted with a smile, friendly waiters and service. The food is amazing, i have tried many italian restaurants in singapore but nothing quite like this one. Burrata, Beef cheek specialty, Calamari, Marinara, Tiramisu and lava cake is a must try! However i have tried most of the food there and there was nothing i didnt like! The pizzas are amazing too! Have been there a couple of times, will always patronize them. Nice ambience and reasonable priced Italian wine list too
2
I had dinner with some good friends from Europe last night, this restaurant was a complete disappointment. The service was poor, the food average at best and little value for money. We never got served any water during the entire evening despite frequent asks, I've tried to alter a side dish on my main course and was told off in a rude and unproffessional manner. Rosso Vino might be ok for some tour groups coming through Robertson Quay but certainly not for guests expecting good Italian food, the name is misleading, don't spoil your evenin
5
This place is by Robertson river and most people sit outside, the atmosphere was great surrounded by other diners sipping wine and eat food, charging away, the pizzas are good and pasta as well, few delicious starters to choose from, and wine as well, it is a little exy but worth it
5
The people working there are genuine, attentive, and warm... Basically they are actually Italian and they know what they are doing. The service is well above the standard, as they will check up on you but not rush you. They present the food in the proper manner and all together. Then the food itself... I haven't tasted food this good outside of Italy! This place was like taking a trip to Italy in just one evening
5
We stumbled on this place by accident whilst out sourcing some take home drinks (alcohol is very expensive in Singapore). We walked across the bridge from our hotel on Magazine Road then turned and took the underpass. As we came out the other side we discovered this absolute gem. I fell in love immediately! The soft romantic music and the smell of delicious food (and garlic bread) was too much to resist. We were seated by a very friendly and efficient waiter who was attentive all night. To top off the mood I ordered a Campari and soda (memories of the 70's came flooding back). The food was delicious and we appreciated the break from Asian cuisine (away from home for alsmost three weeks at this point). From the balcony pots filled with colourful flowers to the black and white photos of Italian movie stars and memorabilia, this wine bar ristorante will transport you to Italy and is well worth a visit
5
Friendly staff, well prepared food and good quality Italian wine. Take an outside table with a view of the river and enjoy We will definitely return if in Singapore again.
5
Stayed just round the corner at the Park Hotel. Excellent food with good atmosphere, would recommend to others
5
We came across this restaurant by chance. It's situated near the river just behind the Park Hotel at Clarke Quay. It's a nice cosy place with warm and friendly staff with good food and an excellent Gluten Free menu which allowed my wife to relax and enjoy her meal without having to worry
5
We were walking along the river checking out the restaurants, some of which were very pricey or noisy or mainstream and thank heavens we found Rosso Vino. The staff were charming and friendly. We felt very welcome and really enjoyed our evening here on the waterfront, watching people pass by while we kicked back with a few glasses of good wine. (I was tempted by the cocktail menu but I don't hold my alcohol very well.) I was amazed - they had a gluten free menu including pasta (! in Singapore). We enjoyed our meal; the food had clean flavours and the beef was lovely. The combination of romantic ambience, professional service, good wine, authentic Italian cuisine and interesting location - we could want nothing else. They stay open quite late so there was no rush. We will return
5
We frequent this restaurant several times a month but rarely review. This time we took some friends who have lived in Singapore 20 years and told us they rarely enjoy Italian food in restaurants they visit. By the end of the meal they were enthusing about how good the food was. My wife and I had the specials and the new squid ink pasta was delicious and the calzone pizza is still the best I've had anywhere. Our friends enjoyed vegetarian dishes with the gnocchi formaggio and mushroom risotto. They were surprised at the high quality of the sauces and flavour given their other experiences over the years in different Italian restaurants. For starters the burrata cherry tomatoes and melanzane were a great combination. By time we got to dessert we could only managed to share the extremely light and very good tiamrisu which is much better than the often heavier variants elsewhere. With complementary limoncello offered at the end it capped a great night out eating by the river with good friends and the best and friendliest service you will find anywhere in Singapore. The chef here really knows his pasta sauces and flavours. Short of going to Italy you will not get a better Italian experience anywhere in Singapore
2
I just called by for a simple italian meal - I thought with a bruschetta and a pizza I couldn't go wrong. oops. The brushetta comprise melted cheese on thick soft bread and 4 small blobs of diced tomato on top. Fresh mozarella? No way. Crispy, delicate bread? Not close. The pizza was thick, dough-y and cheesey. There are much better places to find a decent pizza in Sinagpore....Service was good, prompt and attentive.Fine for kids. Perhaps. Fine for a drink by the river
5
Just round from hotel. This place was lovely had a great meal and drinks. Great staff loved there attitude really went out there way to help my wife who is celiac. Thanks guys. And a nice shot at the end of our meal. Nice touch of the owners Deffo go bac
4
Alfresco dining without the high price tag. Our family of four are frequent diners at Rosso Vino, as it is also convenient to where we live. There are plenty of Italian restaurants around, but not all have the same level of service and range of homestyle cooking. A select number of pastas are homemade, but in general all the pasta is good quality and cooked to perfection. Thus far, we haven't experienced a bad meal and have always left feeling very satisfied. Definitely a local favourite. They can cater for a crowd or a couple and do so with ease
2
We visited this restaurant to!lowing a recommendation. My husband's pizza was apparently delicious but I was very disappointed with their pasta menu. The waiter admitted that although the menu claimed virtually every pasta was homemade, in fact only the gnocchi was made on the premises. All the other pasta dishes were prepared using dried pasta imported from Italy. I don't have any knowledge of Singapore's trading standard policies but would guess this type of procedure might contravene UK regualtions
3
We were there a couple days ago.I ordered homemade gnocchis with pesto sauce and a glass of red wine.My girlfriend took spaghetti with crab sauce and a glass of tab water. It seems they do not like to wait tab water.Anyway, the crab spaghetti were quite good. On the other hand, my gnocchis tasted of nothing. Even the pesto sauce hadn't much flavor.They served the Merlot directly from the fridge, a 5 degree wine is definitely a no-go!At least the espresso and the italian style ice cream were great
5
In the heart of Robertson Quay, you find the most cosy place with warm lightning and comfortable seating. I was with a friend passing by for dinner and enquire on recommendation. The staff was really polite and friendly. Ask
5
Nice ambience, friendly and professional staff. Authentic Italian restaurant that offers delectable italian dishes. The tiramisu is special. It has crsipy edges! I would love to visit this restaurant again. :)
5
Having been to a number of Italian restaurants in Singapore, this place is now a favourite. Authentic food with amazing service. Was made very comfortable from start, also served professionally and yet warmly as well. Highly recomended!!. Will definitely be back.
5
Excellent Service, Food are good, Best tiramisu in town. Good wine selection. Manager, Salvo would go the extra mile in delivering service excellence to his customers. Overall, we enjoyed our dining experiences here every time and would recommend to our friends. Good Job guys!
4
We discovered this Italian Restaurant near Clarke Quay Park Hotel, which for walkers is nearer to Robertson Quay. We thoroughly recommend Rosso Vino, it is not sophisticated but we ate here two nights running, the price is reasonable and and the food wholesome. We enjoyed a good selection of cocktails too! The staff were friendly and wecoming;thank you, you made our stay in Singapore extra special
4
We had pasta and pizza in here and there's quite a big difference. The pasta special was very tasty and cooked just right. The prawn pizza taste was not so good and base too thick - just ok. The crispy tiramisu was lovely, light texture and nice crispy covering. Great location, ambience and authentic Italian service so will come back
5
Rosso Vino is the best Italian restaurant I have dined at in a long time. I ordered a burrata salad for appetizer and ravioli with porcini mushroom cream sauce for main course. My husband had lamb shank, and chocolate canoli for dessert. The food was very delicious and we could tell it was prepared with a lot of care and attention. This was our second visit to Rosso Vino within a couple of weeks. The service on both occasions was attentive and knowledgeable as well as made us feel very welcome. My husband especially liked the background music being played which was apt for the restaurant's riverside setting. We will definitely return
5
I had dinner with my father last Tuesday and even though we are quite picky with Italian restaurant abroad,Rosso Vino has been a pleasant surprise!We had some starters with cheese and parmaham,then Lasagna and Gnocchi alla Sorrentina which were amazing and a really tasty Tiramisù as dessert.The Manager Salvo,Italian,has been really friendly and helpful with us and we had the chance to talk also with the Chef,italian as well.I'll definitely come back and suggest it for real Italian food in Singapore.Well done guys!!
4
Lovely place right on the river bank! not stupidly priced - which is good i hate feeling ripped off!! the staff were lovely and as i am pregnant at the minute they made serveral changes on the menu and drinks so i could have what i wanted!! Definatly worth a visit!
5
We read about Rosso Vino on Tripadvisor. We booked a table despite being slightly concerned about an Italian restaurant that called itself Rosso Vino, rather than Vino Rosso! We needn't have worried – we thoroughly enjoyed our visit, and this place easily passed my first and most important test of a good Italian restaurant which is that you go there when you are in a party mood, to have a good time. There are so many pretentious restaurants about these days that if you go to one of those (with high expectations and high prices) the evening becomes a catastrophe if something goes awry. In Italy, as long as you make sure the waiter understands you are there to have fun all will be well – even if not everything goes strictly to plan.So bearing that in mind, Rosso Vino was a great success. The service was excellent, as was the food. The location is hard to beat, on the waterfront with people strolling by. The white wine we chose was properly chilled in a bucket and they quite understood that I wanted to be in charge of pouring it (another sign of a good, unpretentious restaurant!). The price was reasonable – you really need to go there, and you will see that I am not exaggerating
4
Centrally located, great outdoor space and a lovely bar.
The staff very friendly and on top of things....try the house Gin and Tonic,mover looking the river......:)
5
Excellent food tastier than it's description, beautiful setting and very friendly and efficient service. Highly recommended!
5
The best Italian food out side from Italy.
So friendly service.
Pizza and calzone are the best food here.
Schöne grüße aus Deutschland
4
Had the penne arrabiata here. Really delicious. My colleague had the Bombay pizza which he really enjoyed. Friendly service, good food.
4
Pleasant Italian restaurant located on the edge of Clarke Quay. It has a good aspect overlooking the river and is peasantly furnished. The menu was good and the service excellent and friendly. We ate here twice, had good well chilled white wine with good well cooked and presented food. It was relatively cool for Singapore so we sat outside but there is a cooler inside if you need that. Two pleasant meals Saturday and Monday evenings. I can recommend it's worth a visit
1
We arrived in Singapore in the afternoon and walked to this restaurant to book a table by the river for the evening after reading good reviews. The manager said that he could book us an outside table. On arriving there were no tables free by the river and we were given a table just outside facing an unattractive back street by a huge TV screen, on top of some sort of manhole cover! NICE! As all the other outside tables were full there was no choice. The food was mediocre.Will not be returning
3
We had picked this out as worth a visit so stopped by to try their late afternoon cheese & wine platter to share: 2 glasses of wine & a cheese platter @ SD29 served after 4pm. We were a bit early but they were happy to serve us. Staff very kind and accommodating & good service (not many other customers). House wine was perfectly drinkable & served at right temperature in appropriate glasses. However I think that a self-respecting mouse would have complained about the size of the cheese platter. 4 tiny crackers between two & nice selection of cheeses 4 types) but tiny portions. Would probably suit if on a low fat diet but don't go if you like a decent portion of cheese. Needless to say we never went back for dinner
5
first meal here for a few weeks after 2 weeks vacation in Sydney. Never disappointed here. The current special menu has a calzone that is the best I've ever had and is full of flavour. Ambience here is unbeatable given the riverside location and fantastic italian service by salvo and team. The pasta sauces here are particularly good and I would always recommend trying the latest specials options.
4
Had a lovely evening meal at Rosso Vino, great relaxing feel, great food and wine, despite first wine we chose not quite right identified by the waiter and was changed immediately. Food was great, piping hot and really tasty . Finished off with Singapore sling and have to say the best we have had, thank you
2
I'll admit from the very beginning that I find restaurants (not hawkers) very expensive in Singapore and that I really dislike the routine of adding 10+7% extra on the bill. It is a tradition that should be abolished. So, that said I think that this restaurant probably is no more expensive than others in this city. However, when I find that the waiter brings us still water that is Italian and therefore very expensive and far worse when we are overcharged for some extra olives which happen to be some of the most tasteless olives I ever tried, then I am definitely getting annoyed.The food is alright but nothing extra and I get the feeling that people who really love the food here are so homesick that their judgement has been clouded. Either that, or they have never tried tasty Italian food.OK, the bill was corrected when we complained about the olives but for me the experience of being overcharged would not let go. Save your money and take Italian cooking classes instead
5
This was a favourite of ours diring a stopover stay in Singapore.
Great food, nice atmosphere, great service.
Outside space so kids didn't annoy other diners.
4
the food was good, so was the service. Interesting to find a gluten free menu :). The gluten free pasta is awesome, authentic italian taste :)
5
Lovely setting and staff very pleasant! We had a couple of drinks a piazza and fries for less then 30 singapore dollars can't beat that for value.
5
We ate here as a family on New Year's Eve 2014. We received great attention from the staff and the food was delicious, (gluten free choices and vegetarian too) Service was extremely fast. Would recommend.
5
Incredibly tasty Fettuccine Alfredo. Great sea bass and indulgent flowing chocolate lava cake. Carbonara was a little too bacon flavoured but still good. Service was impeccable. Nice location on riverside. Thank you for a memorable dinner. Excellent
5
Recently travelled to Singapore for a 3 week period with work. Dined at this restaurant a number of times. Excellent service, great food and lovely setting near riverside. Staff very friendly. We will certainly be visiting again (Feb 2015 our next work
trip!)
4
This was our last stop before we retrieved our bags and headed for the airport as it was so close to our hotel. Staff were friendly and service good, including giving WiFi password. We didn't have time to eat but were envious of diners after the delicious smells from the kitchen. Cocktails were made well, and the place offers a great relaxed environment to enjoy them.
3
We went there tonight, party of 5. We had spaghetti Carbonara that was very good, a calzone that was good, pasta with seafood and risotto that were ok and Greek salad that was bad. Service was very friendly but very slow. For the price we paid I expected more...One of those dinners that you forget a day later and that's it... No mark left.
4
We visited this restaurant based on tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed. Initially, we had problems getting a reservation but realised later that they do not open until 4pm onwards. It is a short walk from Clarke Quay, right underneath the "Park Hotel" on the riverside in Robertson Quay.Due to its location out of the touristy Clarke and Boat Quays we found the menu reasonably priced including alcohol, as its certainly not cheap to eat and drink in Singapore!Six of us, including 2 locals ate there and everyone commented in how good both the starters and mains were, in fact we were too full to order deserts and coffee.We had minestrone with fresh bread, calamari, and cheese garlic breads, plus lasagne, fries, seafood tagliatelle, and arrabiata pasta which was asked for spicy and it was just that!Everyone enjoyed the meal and its well worth the short walk to Robertson Quay for good food at a reasonable price, and good wine.Our friends who live in Singapore had never eaten there and said they too will go back
4
We enjoyed our dinner here and would recommend it for classic Italian fare. We went early enough to enjoy their 2-for-1 cocktail hour and ordered an appetizer of bruschetta to go with the drinks. Then we shared one of my favorite dishes - beef carparccio which was served with the classic lemon, olive oil, shaved parmesan and was delicious. Lastly we tried a plate of pasta with a spicy sauce that was also good. The wine list is good and not too expensive
5
Opened till noon and later, could help you to taste real italian style. Must try: spaghetti, pizza and fiorentina. Thanks to Salvo, Carlo and Aldo.
5
Variety of Italian food choices. Very friendly most Italian staff. They serve a good Merrlot whine, quality pizza's, great home made pasta and much more. Looking out on the river it is a very nice place to eat!
4
Based in Robertson Quay this Italian Restaurant provides a good change to the traditional cuisine. Probably more good than very good but the service was good and even though we arrived after 10pm we were made very welcome. The outlook of the river makes this a very pleasant place to eat.We were certainly challenging of our requirements but the food was served quick, was well presented and fresh.An enjoyable evening although be warned getting away from Robertson Quay at moddnight was difficult - perhaps pre book a taxi
5
One of the few Authentic Italian Food and Staff restaurants, in Singapore!Great Pizza and Meat! Hard to believe, but one of the best Fiorentina (T-bone ) I've ever eaten.High quality products, really nice staff and beautiful River View. Open until 0.30 Am, not easy to find in Singapore
4
I have not tried anything else than a quattro staggioni pizza ! I am still thinking about the tomoato base - really tasteful ! As well as the ham ! The pizza base is not impressive enough to make it the perfect pizza (and it is not wood oven!) but it is a very good one ! The terrace is nice, service is good, price are a bit high (23.90$ for a pizza but this area of Singapore is far from being cheap!). The tiramisu was very good as well.Will be back

We usually eat the food of the country when we travel but on our first night we were tired and Rosso Vino was convenient. The food was so good we went back the next night. The service was excellent and Julio looked after us well. The location is good overlooking the river. The best gnocchi I've ever tasted

Authentic Italian restaurant with great food, great location and great atmosphere. The staff is friendly and service is excellent. Try the homemade pasta. I do not typically order lasagna but their has become one of our favorites along with Fettucini Bolognese. Prices are reasonable for Singapore

We were in Singapore for a couple of days getting over our jet-lag from our flight from Canada. We took a walk along the riverside, enjoying all that Clark Quay had to offer. When heading back to our hotel we decided to stop at  Rosso Vino for dinner. I had no idea at this point that our day of exploring was to turn into a great evening of dining!I cannot say enough good about this restaurant. The food was excellent and the portions of each were ample. The staff were beyond great, making sure that every request , was looked after. We had a table which looked over the river and there was more than one person that passed that stopped to comment on the portion size of my calzone.We stopped here, to begin with, for a dinner before heading to our hotel, It ended up that we had an evening dining experience, staying at the Rosso Vino for more that 3 hours. Their hospitality and warmth makes you want to stay all night.Thank you to all the people at Rosso Vino that made our evening so memorable

I'm coming to this place almost for a year! Without no doubt, just gave happiness to my days. We just can expect the best from this place!The food is amazing, the cocktails are outstanding and staff is wonderful! I fully recommend! And thank you all for the great service. It's always a pleasure to come back

We went to Rosso Vino to celebrate a milestone and had a great dining experience. We enjoyed a lovely mixed platter followed by pasta, particularly good Carbonara. The wine selection is very good without being over the top. Our server was a very knowledgeable Silician gentleman called Carlos. The ability to sit outside and overlook the river is a real plus. Well done to Salvatore and the team at Rosso Vino

Located at Singapore riverside making this lovely and romantic Italian restaurant become my favorite dining all the time.
5
A little bit of Italy close to our hotel. Food and service were exceptional. We chose the home made pasta dishes which were very close to what we get at home.
5
I love all the dishes I had! Good food! Good service! Awesome experience! Will definitely come back!
5
The food was great, the service was outstanding, and the prices were reasonable
If you are in Singapore we recommend that you try this restaurant, located right next to the Robertson Quay hotel
Sincerely
4 ladies, always happy 😄

So glad we ended our Singapore trip here.
We all had a variety of dishes and everyone one was delightful.
Cocktails.... Amazing. Good work guys.
5
Wonderful night by the river with great food and service was genuine with truly Italian heritage. Will come back gain for sure
5
The location is fantastic and just along the river it offers a great view. Love the tiramisu and lava cake.... Excellent food, good service and friendly staff. The chef gave us really good recommendations and he was very charming. One of the best Italian food I had in Singapore... I will be back soon!

Lovely location. Right on the rivers edge. We went for cocktails. The restaurant is Italian. The wait staff are Italian. The staff enjoy having a conversation if time allows... Enjoyed so much we went back much later in the evening for a cheese platter.. Pricing is reasonable. Cocktail hour from 4-7pm two for the price of one.. Excellent value.
5
I had a great evening at Rossovino by the river, the staff is very friendly and attentive, it has a great location by the river at Roberston Quay and the atmosphere was relaxed and cordial.I had a super-fresh and tasty salad plus a generous portion of Lasagne which was very good, and I'm looking forward to try the rest of the menu on my next visits. Good wine list too

My meal here was my first and most likely last, although the service and location was nice the food was not.I ordered a chicken parmigiana (was supposed to be) and what I was served was without a doubt the least impressive I have ever had. Was quite disappointing considering its an 'authentic Italian' place and its supposed to be good food.The chicken was like something from a supermarket deli and was very thin, very dry, the sauce was a tiny serve, no cheese. Had better at a pub eve
5
Best in town! All is real italian! For me travelling around Asia for many weeks, it's like to back in Italy, basically like a dream.
5
If you do nothing else while you are in Singapore you must visit here and try their calzone pizza!! The best ever!!! Including Italy. Great menu fantastic staff one great place to be.
4
Italian good which was good for a quick bite! Much needed after 14hrs of flying!!
Popped back for a great happy hr! Buy one get one free! Lush strawberry daiquiri!!
Lovely quick service!!
5
We had several meals here - all excellent - especially the fish. Lovely setting on the banks of the Singapore River, very quiet and romantic - and terrific service.
3
Reasonably decent Italian food. Service was nice. Pricing was reasonable for Robinson Quay (which is generally an expensive place to eat). Nice location by the river, although you do get a lot of pedestrian traffic through the open air eating area because of the location in the dog leg between the river and the entrance to the next door hotel
5
After reading reviews on Tripadvisor, I booked a table at this restaurant. The steak with porcini mushrooms was thick, well cooked and flavoursome. My husband really enjoyed his seafood pasta. The wine list was quite good for a small restaurant. We sat outside and had a lovely view over the water. The restaurant has only been opened under new management since April and it is obviously doing very well indeed. The waiter was pleasant and well informed re food and wine. I would most definitely visit Rosso Vino next time we are in Singapore
5
We found this place with our friend who has been in Singapore now for nearly a year and hadn't been there. Initially attracted by the food that wasn't overpriced and was extensive, we were even more impressed with the service and attention. The wine list is extensive and we opted for the merlot at the top of the list which proved to be an absolute bargain. Nice touch was the ice cream with a candle in for my husband at the end of the meal as it was his birthday. Highly recommended and our friend will definitely be back.

We went to this restaurant for a get together with my good friends and I was blown away. The almost hidden location leads to an awesome space with good drinks & excellent food. Our starters of Bruschetta with Anchovy, Caprese and Calamary were light but yet tasty in an understated manner. In fact, our subsequent main courses of Greek Salad, Red Snapper and Pepperoni Pizza had that same characteristic which blew our taste buds away. The food turned out light but yet immensely tasty and satisfying.The food tasted even better because the chef Aldo Chiloiro came out and personally served us our meal. The staffs are very knowledgeable and friendly. The team at Rosso Vino were also incredibly attentive and made sure dinner was not rushed or haphazard, diners were comfortable and relaxed, and that the night was spent as if in the company of many friends. Service was excellent even it was crowded during our visit on a Thursday night however we were lucky to have a comfortable place to sit. When in Singapore a visit to Rosso Vino is a must

Great wine and also served very well. Very nice little boutique Italian amongst bigger restaurants. I enjoyed the bar menu watching European soccer games on the bar screen. The seafood and mushroom pasta was tasty, but could maybe have been a bigger size. Plenty of attentive staff although the bar attendant didn't seem to be on the same team
5
Had a lovely and quaint dinner with a friend by the riverside in a location that is just by the river at Robertson Quay but not at the crowded Robertson Walk area. It's romantic, has an elegant atmosphere and it was pretty crowded for a Monday! The location is also very accessible as it is just next to the underpass from Clarke Quay. I ordered quattro formaggi pizza and it was just the right size, super thin slice of pizza and the cheese was dripping over the pizza, and the cheese was not the typical four cheese, it had specific (i think Italian) cheese used for the pizza. It was not overwhelming (as some restaurants use blue cheese for their 4 cheese, way too strong sometimes) but I think I could honestly munch on one or even two of the whole 30cm pizza, it was really light. Pretty much majority of the smiling servers and chef are Italiano so you know you're getting a bonafide Italian experience :) To those who love the dolce vita, this is a purely Italian experience worth trying! It will be your favourite spot to chill after work for dinner with a friend or two, or a large company as they have really nice lounge seats

Excellent service, nice, chilly cocktails, we did not try the food though but we will definitely be back!
3
Staff is nice, good vine list but for an Italian restaurant, food was pretty average. Very good service but the food clearly overpriced.
5
Dining al fresco, attentive waiter, tasty food, cold beer, riverside service, good ambience - what more can we say?
4
excellent wine list! had an appetizer & pizza, a simple but considered as classic in Italian cuisine.we had a very straight-forward food but the taste is satisfying! other than food what really amazed me is the quality of service, which is a deal breaker whether you want to come back again to the place or not. It was excellent food service!Am I going back again to this place? hell yessss! definitely ! And to the friendly chef Aldo who served the choco lava cake by himself :)all the best to the joint & crew 
5
After walking past a couple of times, thinking it was a bit highbrow for us (and was I wrong). Decided to stop because we were getting fed up with fish (all the local restaurant serve fish).And what a great menu, Salads that are first class pasta to die for, and world class pizzas.The staff are first class and great service by all, would recommend this restaurant to anybody that loves good food cocked properly with the right use of oils and spice
5
Well...for an italian reataurant based in singapore, its location mainly and the fresh produce...great choice for a fulfilling dining experience. The staff are friendly; attentive and very efficient. The busy head chef takes time to make speech with diners, popping up every once in'awile then hastening back to the kitchen. Food quality was surprisingly good, tasty with flavour rather than heavy salting like some italian restaurants. Well served food portions(not puny) with well balanced sauces.Good selection of wine. Bread for seafood soup was just okay...soup too but the uber fresh ingredients made up for it.A nice place to have a quiet chill; dinner.. easy to miss out as it is quite away from the busy stretch of robertson quay's drinking hole. Oh...and did i mention their prices are pocket friendly? I did?..oh yes..just a gentle reminder =

We stumbled upon this place yesterday when we were across the way seeing a play at the DBS Arts Centre. Usually we exit through the back entrance and find ourselves in the crowded center of Robertson Quay, which I don't particularly like, and end up scrambling for a place to eat post show. Rosso Vino will definitely be our go to place going forward. Food was good, prices reasonable, nice ambience. The service was friendly, but a bit random...based on the other reviews, maybe they were having a slightly off night. Nonetheless a great find and we'll be back

We have just ended our 3 week holiday with a last stop in Singapore and if it hadn't been for this restaurant and it's staff our last stop would have been awful! We found this cute Italian on the corner from our hotel and just thought we'd stop in for a happy hour beer, little did we know we then would spend our last 2 nights and last lunch there before flying home. The staff was so helpful, and engaging especially a very tall Italian gentleman server (cannot remember his name). They couldn't not do enough. And the food well that was just to die for. The group had everything from the brushetta, to the best seafood soup, to the flavourful steaks, to the mushroom ravioli and the most amazing thin crust pizza. My husband saying it was the best pizza he'd ever had. This place is just an absolute gem!

Located conveniently, near but not in the hustle and bustle of Clarke Quay itself, this cozy Italian spot is great for drinks, dinner or both. The wine menu looked good. I enjoyed my glass of merlot, which was a perfect accompaniment to dinner.Their menu comprises of starters, pizzas, pastas, salads and dessert. While the taste of the food itself is commendable, it is the service that is OUTSTANDING. Staff is polite, attentive and friendly without being too blatant. The gentleman serving our table, Dwayne, did a fantastic job. Many restaurants do not realize that aside from the food, how staff makes you feel goes a long way in ensuring regular customers return time and again. Clearly Rosso Vino has grasped this idea. Owner Nicola also stopped by at our table with our fettuccine, which I have to say, was fabulous, and my husband agreed (a hard palate to please). The atmosphere is romantic and the place has both indoor and outdoor seating. Overall, an awesome experience, perfect way to say farewell to Singapore. Definitely going to come back to Singapore and won't leave without visiting Rosso Vino

Position on riverfront near Clarke Quay is fantastic. Service and food was divine - Octopus salad and beef sirloin were great & loved lemon sorbet which I drank as consistency was not what you'd normally expect from a sorbet.Would have been a perfect evening, except for guy at next table who stubbed out his fat Cuban cigar as we arrived so he could eat his meal, but then relit it just as our meals arrived. All tables along waterfront are 'smoking' & non-smoking tables are few & more at back of premises
5
Food is good and reasonable price. Staff are friendly and helpful! Keep it up! Will be back soon and try out other good...
5
Staff were helpful, service great, food are tasty. Cost was about what I would expect.Everything is great. Will be back again.
4
Staff were very helpful, service great, food quick and tasty. Cost was about what I would expect. Is located right on the river front and the free bread crackers were appreciated.
5
Besides the meal we had at the lighthouse at the fullerton this was our best meal in singapore, the service was fantastic and the food to match, thank you
4
Ended up here on our last night, right outside our front door, Service was excellent, Meal was good, prices were reasonable for the area,should have gone here instead of the other place's we ate at
3
Good food overall, we ordered a margarita pizza which was very good and garlic bread, excellent. And roasted potato which didnt show up. Wine is good and location is nice. Would not go for a second time, once is enough. Good service
5
Recommend Rosso Vino as we had 6 lovely meals here. We especially wish to thank Salvatore, Carlo, Julio who were friendly and courteous and also Aldo (the Chef) who cooked some wonderful meals. We are afraid we did not get the names of the other staff, but we were never disappointed with either our meals or the service when we ate here
5
Excellent place, nice ambience, great staffs - Karlo, Salvatore(I hope I spell correctly) and another guy who wore black, didn't get his name, and AWESOME food! Highly recommend this place to everyone out there looking for a place to just drink or have dinner or whatever!
4
Rosso Vino is located just beside Robertson Walk, and a little hidden away - and what a pitty. This is a REAL Italian restaurant, with excellent Italian service. The food is to die for - we had to order the appetizer twice - buffalo mozzeralla and ham - just heaven. The waiter suggested the 3 of us to share their T-bone steak - I could have had one for just me - what a piece of meat! Tender, juicy and really well prepared - perfection.Visit Rosso Vino - you won't get dissapointed ;-
2
ordered drinks only,service OK.asked for the bill,promtly served then taken away as "somethings wrong" took 4 requests and thirty minutes to get the same bill back and pay.guy who seemed to be in charge(flat cap and braces on trousers) quite rude.did'nt fancy staying for food due to bad attitude
4
the price is quite high but the wine & food were good. Staff was attentive and the ambience was awesome.
Recommended

Beautiful
place in Robertson quay, friendly people, real Italian food.
Special thanks to Mr Salvatore.
This is one of the few places where I feel home.
Highly recommended.
5
Everything perfect. Delightful food and great service, in the nice atmosphere of Robertson quay. Special thanks to salvatore (manager )

This was a nice relaxed place with a good menu and great food. Try the carpaccio, it is really good.
5
A great place to dine! The service is spotless, elegant ambience authentic Italian food. We had an appetizer of bruschetta, the pasta al dente, the fish very fresh.
Salvo hosted us in a friendly way, really enjoyed the evening.

I do not ever leave reviews for any restaurant, but here I would leave a nice review about the pizza. I went here last friday with my wife, I have pizza quattro stagioni and my wife a simple margherita ! I can just say this pizza was delicious,nice dough, crunchy in the edge and soft in the middle , like the one I had tasted in Italy 
5
Eaten at various Italian restaurants in singapore over last 3 years and rarely go back again, but will be going back here again. Had the fiorentina steak on recommendation and it was cooked to perfection presented very simply along with potatoes and totally delicious. The home cooked past section looks interesting and quite small which is a good sign as not a fan of Italian menus with pages of different pasta dishes. Location is surprisingly quiet and intimate given the riverside location. A couple of nice Italian reds on the wine menu and the Barolo was very good but should have ordered it and opened in advance. Coffee was of a high standard. Service is classic Italian and plenty reassuring Italian presence around restaurant and bar area serving. A good find after a frustrating few years trying mediocre Italian restaurants here
5
From new Zealand and visiting singapore for the first time. Wonderful experience coupled with excellent service and ambience. I must say it was the food that really made me missed rosso vino! The pasta and pizza are simply top class. Service wise is amazing :) very humble and jovial group of staff! Will definitely stop by whenever I visit singapore again.Cheer

We came here with our adult children for dinner and it was relaxing though the service is slow.....not much customer attention. The pizzas were very good, tasty, thin crust. The ensalata caprese not very good as the tomatoes didn't have any tasty, pale looking, they've been frozen! The risotto did look good. Wine is expensive here...the ambience is relaxing near robertson walk along the river so not far from faster place
