Good dim sum at affordable price. The dumplings were good and fresh. The Chinese sausage cooked with chicken was good. Good recommendation

Good food and value for money. Good menu selection. Ample car park. It makes it ideal for get together. 4-private rooms. Of interest is Peking Duck and Dim Sum. Lobster noodle is famous but a little too soft for me. Overall excellent.

Organised group activities here and find the food well served, tasty and good portion. The food texture and presentation are well composed. Recommended.

The food was very basic and cold, club staff were rude, food and drinks were overpriced. The surroundings were unkept, simply not enjoyable. Would never go again.

Our group stopped here for lunch. A club second floor location over looking a green field. The food was served family style. Good but not great.

First time there left me with the deepest positive impression. Love the traditional Chinese deco and clean spacious seating. Each dishes ordered are served with good portions, friendly services and most importantly made fresh and sizzling hot. I'll definitely go back for a few more rounds of Dim Sum Lunch. Highly recommended.

Padang Palace entrance was understated cause their food is Great. There's some innovative dishes and healthy choices that you can try. The waitress, Li Lina, serving us took good care of us and was cheery throughout our meal. For this I award Padang Palace a 5 star

Went for lunch on a weekday. It was not crowded, but service was still slightly slow. Quite disappointed when some of our orders were not available, then we ended up ordered too much based on the Captain's wrong advise.Food was not too bad. Like the roasted crispy chicken, XO fried carrot cake and the steam glutinous rice in lotus leaf

While staying at the Singapore Recreation Club we dined at the in house Padang Palace Restaurant. There was page after page menu items. We had some language difficulties with the staff. The menu items ordered were exquisite. However, the timing of the dishes were off--that is, the fried rice came after we had downed the other items. We found the prices to be reasonable. The ambience was good. It would be helpful to have a Chinese literate friend to accompany you to this dining facility

First time dining at the Chinese restaurant. Was a last minute decision as the SRC cafe was undergoing renovation. The tall bespectacled elderly restaurant captain(manager) who was quick to attend to my last minute walk in was attentive and friendly. There wasn't many people when we arrived. I have always liked chinese restaurants with their elderly chinese speaking captains and even better if the decor is dated, sort of nostagic and brings back the feeling of yesterdays. This restaurant fits the bill.We ordered some dishes as well as dim sum. The noodles were tasty but tad salty while the crispy fish skin was heavenly. The char siew bao was also quite good. Rice grains of the fried rice needs to be softer. The tofu with mushrooms was soft and smooth. Overall damage was about $120++ for four adults and three children. Unsure if there would be a discount for SRC members.The staff were polite and they cleared the dishes pretty quickly. Would I come back again? Yes I would. Although at the time of writing, the pavement leading to SRC is being upgraded, thus it is quite difficult to go there if you are coming from the padang side
