The food was very good especially the first dish with the sea urchin! Very nice place as well definitely coming back again one day!

Food is way below average. A nice colonial house does not make up for the bad food quality. Noisy (behind the main fire station), very pricey, poor ingredients combination. A bad French and bad Japanese restaurant combined. Skip and save over 700$ for two!
5
A favorite and not to be missed. Excellent service to support an eclectic menu of fine French / Japanese fusion.

We went to Lewin Terrace for my mum's birthday. The restaurant staff did up some nice lettering with fruits and even had a complimentary photo-printing service which they printed and framed for us. It was an absolute delightful surprise for everyone

A beautiful and charming black and white house, spacious indoor and outdoor area.We ordered the 7 course set menu, each dish was very good, delicious, creative and beautiful presentations. The wagyu beef main course was excellent. We just loved the size of each of the 7 courses - not too big and not too small.The service was very pleasant and helpful, I forgot my purse and the waiter ran down the stairs to the parking area to give it back to me. Thank you!!!!Highly recommended!!

My daughter had her wedding solemnization held here :) It was Perfect. All went as planned! Their French-Jap fusion food was exquisite, tantalizing and precisely plated, albeit a tad too salty for some. No logistic hitches, no food blunders, no hiccups. You can trust them to do the job perfectly right!In fact, the staff took their job so seriously they didn't even have time to smile. If they could add some soul to their service, I would have given the review a perfect 5/5. A fresh coat of paint for the extremely weather-battered railings and chiffon up from the private car park would certainly give a better first impression and make the climb up more pleasant. Instead of like "Huh? Where are we going?"Overall, very pleased

Food was ok. I guess the main thing going for the restaurant is the ambience. However, if you are going to have the outdoor seating, be warned there will be debris from the nearby trees and plants. The upside is you may spot the resident squirrel running around

I chose Lewin Terrace for its unique charm to celebrate my partner's birthday. We sat at the alfresco section which has a natural, old-time charm, and was peaceful save for the fire station siren that sounded multiple times that night. Our 7-course meal (S$195++) was paced too quickly; within an hour, we had finished 6 courses. Out of the 7 courses, including dessert, we really enjoyed 2 of them--the pates and the polenta. Also, despite it being a really quiet evening--there were just two couples including ourselves--the service staff were not to be in sight at times. Our main server was friendly, and while we weren't expecting kingly service in the least, we found his overall attitude a bit too flippant. Another thing: we found out from our friendly waiter that the head chef was away on holiday; in place was the sous chef. If you're particular, you should call to ask in advance before confirming your booking. Overall, this experience could've been much better had the service and pacing been more thoughtful, food quality notwithstanding

The location is quiet, the mood is right, the food is great. The service is good but just above average. The space is comfortable. Lovely for a romantic quiet dinner. Located at Fort Canning with its own "hidden" access, it gives a sense of mystery right from the start.The menu was sufficient and the food was delicious. Great job from the culinary team making use of seasonal ingredients to make good dishes. It was not mind-blowing but to be fair the food was really pretty good.The service is good but lack warmth. The waiters lack knowledge of the items in the menu and the type of steak cuts available. This is good area to look into for improvement and the service crew's knowledge of what's going on in the kitchen can really make a difference

My wife and I chose this place for our wedding anniversary ahead of all the other similar fine dining restaurants that we had been because we enjoyed ourselves here the last time. Unfortunately for us, things have changed, and really changed - for the worst.We arrived on time at the car park and the valet there was nice and helpful. We parked and made our way up the familiar long steps, this time we noticed encouraging signs displayed to help us on the climb. Nice touch. So far so good.Then, the minute we arrived at the top, everything changed. There was no greeter as we would expect for a restaurant this class. We had to walk in and practically grab someone for our reservation, and was led back to the front for him to check.Ok, minor problem, so we were shown to our table and there we sat. No service. no bread. no menu, no water. So we waited. It was never liked that before.After awhile, the next table guests arrived and was shown their table. To our surprised they got service. The guy who serviced that table did not even bat an eye to us.After awhile, we could not continue to wait, so we beckon to the nearest staff in view, whom we later learnt was the sommelier. He was talking to another staff, and seem quite perturbed to be interrupted by our signal. When we asked for the service, we were given an irritating look, and told sharply that it will come.To cut the long story short, our evening was now spoilt although very normal service, as it would expect in any cafe then resumed.We found the food to be ok, ordinary and not as what we had expected for a restaurant with such a reputation. For the price they charged, it is definitely overpriced.We were fond of this place, way before, when it was known as Flutes and not Lewin Terrace, and the few times we came under the Lewin brand. As of now, its not worth the price of a normal meal that we can get in so many other restaurants in Singapore. That is the extent of our disappointment
1
We came for a nice couple dinner. We didn’t stay because their was a company dinner/corporate event with a noisy one man show. You don’t expect to pay this kind of price in this case... disapointing...
2
After seeing amazing reviews online I was deeply disappointed by the food. None of the appetizer, cocktails, mains dishes ou desserts was pleasant.Blend and boring food. Tasteless. Not worth the money at all despite the good service and environment.
1
Had a table indoor but found a fly in my dish. When I told the waiter about it, he brought it back to kitchen and when he returned, he said that they could not do anything about it.
4
A charming venue that sets the tone for the experience. But beware if you have trouble climbing the stairs. The service was friendly and the meal was well executed. Expensive so be prepared to splurge.
5
Got married here last year and decided to return for our first anniversary. Ambience was as magical and enchanting as the year before and we enjoyed every second that we spent there. We were pleasantly surprised by the special welcome drink and the surprise anniversary gift and cake at the end of the meal. Definitely a place for those looking to celebrate a special day
4
Great place for an intimate lunch or dinner among the trees and in a colonial bungalow. Even better if it's raining out - cools it down to sit comfortably in the alfresco terrace. Because we were there with my octogenarian mom (who btw easily navigated the 50 steps), the manager tells us we could call ahead and get access through a private road if we had someone with mobility issues.
4
A satisfying meal in a wonderful heritage bungalow and with great company! Beautiful quiet and green ambience, attentive staff and excellent food. What can we asked for! Loved the warm bread served with butter and yuzu jam. Had salmon as the main course while my friends chose the roasted pork loin and wagyu beef steak. The pumpkin soup was also good - thick and creamy and served piping hot from a teapot. Dessert was ok but prettily presented. Prices were reasonable. Entry is challenging as one needs to manoeuvre up a pretty steep flight of steps from the grounds of the Philatelic Museum. However, worth a try
5
We visited during lunch time to celebrate my wifr’s birthday, restaurant was very nice to arrange a pleasant surprise for her. Staff service was great and very warm, gave her a free upgrade of meal as well. A small token but enlightens the overall experience. Highly recommend
5
The restaurant gives us a cozy feeling when we first arrived. It is surrounded by the greens and the feeling is great. The environment that was set in the restaurants makes you feel that you are embraced by nature. I would recommend the restaurant to people who know how to appreciate the natural habitual of the area. Singapore we are urbanised and you would rarely be able to find such a gem. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the service team, they are professional and friendly. Kudos to the service team!! Thank you for making our dining experience wonderful
5
We enjoyed a wonderful dinner for my wife's birthday at Lewin Terrace. We opted for the chef's 7 course tasting menu. Each dish was beautifully presented with helpful recommendations and information about the ingredients, combination of flavours and presentation. The infused beef consommé, lobster and foie gras with Kobe beef were of particular note. Lovely atmosphere and very attentive and helpful staff who know how to mix a good cocktail
5
Excellent environment to dine in. The waiter that served us was professional and patiently explained all the key ingredients that were used in the various dishes. overall an excellent dining experience!
5
Romantic atmosphere for couples. Service was attentive and servers were knowledgeable. Good selection of wines. The food is worthy of Michelin standard.
5
Lewin Terrace is a restaurant with good food and good ambience. Centrally located but don't missed the sign to go up the restaurant. Slightly pricey on the water.
5
went for wedding anniversary with wifey weeks after moving to singapore so without knowing the city well. Absolute wonderful evening. the food is japanese with french influence, or the opposite. the place is in an old black and white singapore house. The staff were wonderful, particularly the young french sommelier, I like my food and this was really special. cherry on the cake, we asked them to take a picture of us (it was our 15 anniversary) and at the end of the dinner they brought the picture in a frame... will definitely go back
5
Celebrated my 9th anniversary at Lewin Terrace and a great choice it was!Having never been to this restaurant but heard plenty about it since my younger days, the idea of dining there never cross me mind until this anniversary.From the reservation follow-up call to the reception to the service, the staff performed above expectations, making our experience a 5 out of 5.Food-wise, the menu was very creative with an excellent fusion of japanese with french preparation methods; my partner, however, found the food normal (in terms of fine dining) and nothing to shout about.Overall, the entire experience was excellent and I highly recommend this restaurant for special occasions.
5
We had the 3-course Set Lunch during their Strawberry season menu. The service was excellent all the way from the warm and welcoming valet to all the service staff at the restaurant. The staff are very attentive and always made sure they we have everything we need before we even had to ask. The restaurant is set amongst lush greenery on a hill. It is a nice quiet place and its interior is also pleasant and comfortable. Useful to know that the entrance is at the Philatelic Museum.Overall, the food was very good. I had salmon and it was absolutely wonderful. I could taste the flavours inside the salmon, and it was cooked to perfection. They had a nice birthday surprise as well, ensuring that we had a wonderful and enjoyable experience
5
A little gem that no one had told us about. Lovely setting among the trees in an older style building. Sitting on the terrace was wonderful. Cooled by overhead fans, or with air con inside, it was a great place for a long lunch. The food was devine ... we are still talking about it. A wonderful fusion of Japanese and French. Fresh ingredients, used creatively. Lovely attentive service. A truly special discovery

A nice restaurant setting, colonial bungalow hidden inside fort canning. The place has this peaceful vintage charm. Outdoor sitting is not recommended if you are the type that has an outstanding metabolic rate. It's really hot & humid to say the least. Restaurant did all they can & fixed lots of fans but I still choose the indoor Aircon seating, simply more comfortable.Location of the restaurant is another issue to take note, if you are cabing, pls make sure you alight behind the fire station. That's the correct entrance & then take a climb up the stairs to the restaurant. For girls that will struggle wearing high heel on flat road. Pls wear flat shoes, for your own safety. Good wise, only The wagyu beef was memorable, everything else was only acceptable. My friend & i had a bottle of wine, starter, maincourse follow by dessert. We choose the Ala carte options as we don't like the set suggested to us. Bill came to close to $400. As what I would expect.
5
Fantastic food, excellent service, great ambience. The restaurant is ideal for wedding ceremonies as it is located in a simply stunning black and white house. The food is delicious - this is fine dining, so expect small portions. But each bite is simply fantastic. Service is also excellent, very attentive staff.
5
We opted for the Sho-Mi Summer menu (6 courses). 3 dishes were our favourites - Japanese tomato with burrata, Angel prawn and their Challan Duck (Wow!) I found the portions very filling. It was a quiet Sunday night, peaceful setting for some birthday indulgence as a couple. And yes, we parked in the wrong carpark; meandered a bit to find this place. (good walk after a fulfilling dinner!
5
Great menu options, Excellent food, Professional Service, Drinks are slight more expensive than they need to be.

Enjoyed the evening with my family. Appreciated the art of the fushion food, chefs did a good job and the serving team members. Thank you for the lovely evening.
4
The palate was very well prepared with extremely careful considerations for texture, color and taste. All very beautifully presented like nowhere else.
5
No doubt on the service and quality of food. Super thumbs up. Great atmosphere with superb food. Nice
5
Everything was perfect! Service, food, ambience - everything made my birthday there absolutely perfect!
4
We had a wine tasting event held there. Setting was beautiful - a charming colonial building. Food was competent but not wow. The chief letdown was a French sommelier who doesn't seem familiar with the wines being served. Beyond giving generic tasting notes, could have been more informative in helping guide wine choices. Needs to learn from our local sommelier heros on service and standards.
5
Service was warm, attentive and professional. A birthday surprise was presented which was so thoughtful of a restaurant to do so! Food was amazing! One of the best fine dining places in Sg if not THE best. Special mention of our server -- Reza thank u so much for making our night so memorable

I used to frequent the Lewin bungalow at Fort Canning Park when it was run as Flutes at the Fort. It sits on a slope overlooking the fire station completely surrounded by trees and greenery and blossoming franjipani. The veranda is definitely the highlight of the place where one can enjoy the colonial style architecture which looks pretty close to what it would have looked like over 100 years ago. I had a special occasion to celebrate and the veranda was the perfect setting. The friendly staff helped by directing a fan towards our table to alleviate the midday heat. We ordered the business lunch set menu. Fortunately I was here for the atmosphere which is lovely to say the least; sadly the food underwhelmed. The appetiser of white asparagus, smoked duck, green peas and egg was a good concept, but I don't believe in serving raw egg white on a dish of this sort. For the mains, we had the seabass roast and the lamb rack roast. The seabass was cooked well but surprisingly the mashed potatoes were not. They tasted as if they were cooked the day before with more milk flavour than potato. And they were cold. The lamb tasted more like beef and was incredibly tough and devoid of elegant flavour the price tag demands. Each of the two tiny morsels had a bone inserted into them to make them look like lamb chops. The eggplant rolls were simply terrible and cold; and finally there was a brush of green peas across the plate. There was not enough substance to taste anything so the effect was purely ornamental. Perhaps I missed out on the latest trend in ornamental food creations. My bad

For those of you who drive, the restaurant has a shared the carpark with the museum which includes valet service. From the carpark, it is quite a walk up those stairs to get to the restaurant. Definitely not recommended for those who have knee / leg problems or are heavily pregnant.The decor is elegant and classy with light homey tones of brown set against a white dreamy background. There are both indoor and outdoor seating. It was a 5 course meal and we had:1. Salmon & Roe with Cauliflower and Sesame Oil2. Hokkaido Kegani (King Crab) with NAMAFU and Japanese Fishcake3. Codfish with Mango, Savoy Cabbage and Lime Leaf4. Australian Lamb Loin with Bitter Orange and 6 years Kanzuri /Amadai (Tile Fish) with Lily Root and Koshihikari5. Raspberry Eclair with Rose and Setouchi Organic LemonThere were some hits and misses, and while the flavors were innovative, they were really nothing to rave about. Moreover, although the ambience and plating of the food was exquisite, the portions were a disappointment. That said, overall, it was still an interesting fine dining experience. For more photos and the experience, please check out my blog

I was there for lunch with friends. We were all excited to be there.The food were pretty, but somethings were not so tasty to us Japanese women. Appetizer was tricolored round things on skewers. I can't remember what they were, but we were not thrilled. My next dish had fried fish as decorations. The dish tasted good, but to sure about presentation. The main was a nice cod fish. It was tasty and presentation was nice. We did not have dessert because the choices were not to our taste.Overall, I give the restaurant B. May try again in the future
3
A very good set-up restaurant, great services by the staff, unfortunate the foods quality well below expectation and don't matched the reviews received.
5
The food has been great as always. We also appreciated the nice atmosphere of this quiet location. The customised drinks are worth a try too!
5
Well worth a visit.
The entire meal was beautifully presented even down to the Japanese ceramics.
The winter menu was intelligent, creative and original. Staff were excellent.
2
Overall I was not too impressed with the food here that I find to be lacklustre in taste. We have doubts over the freshness and quality of some of the ingredients used, and also the preparation techniques employed to prepare them (eg. I had to send the fish course (sea bream) back to the kitchen as the texture was way too dry). However, I must say that the wine-pairing is good with a very knowledgeable (chief) sommelie
5
Walking along the Canning park to wait for next Battlebox tour. Found a nice Japanese and French fusion cuisine restaurant in the park.They offer 2 courses set below SGD 40, 4 courses set below SGD 80 and full set over SGD 100. Tried the 2 courses set lunch outdoor alone. A French guy brought me the fresh bread on hot stone, which was tasted very good. He also explained the cooking and ingredients of my dishes. A nice and funny guy
5
came for dinner, and we tried both sets, and opted to pair the meal with 2 sakes from the ala carte menu. the japanese sake sommelier was very knowledgeable and friendly, and patiently went down the list to share each sake, as well as provide his own recommendations based on our tastes. each dish brought out was unique and delicious. the ambience was romantic, which explains why this place is often chosen as a wedding venue. a truly enjoyable experienc
5
I had made areservation for 4 but subssequently amended the reservation to 5. However when I turned up, the table set for us was only for 4.In spite of the confusion, the table was quickly set up again to accomodate all of us in double quick time.Food was delicious although nothing really stood out this visit
5
The restaurant is set on a hill amongst the vegetation in Fort Canning; just less than 50 steps from a car park at the foothill in-between a stamp museum and the masons, low and behold a black and white bungalow appears. This is our return visit to Lewin Terrace 3 months ago in January 2017. The menu at Lewin Terrace is generally Japanese-French cuisine. On this rainy day, we had lunch as part of World Gourmet Summit Epicurean Delights, where Chef Matsumoto culinary expertise was paired with Pastry Chef Kiriko Nakamura from Japan. Both delighted us in-person and in their cuisine!Chef Matsumoto presented 3 dishes comprising Mont Blanc with Wagyu beef, Japanese influenced bouillabase, and main course of beef onion rice. Chef's Matsumoto rendition of Mont Blanc starter was rather unique where chopped marinated Wagyu were covered with stripes of potato made to pasta. To us, this dish is what you could find in an established fine dining restaurant, with Michelin stars.Next two were desserts presented by pastry chef Kiriko. First dessert was combination of sorbet-like fruits, herbs (basil) best consumed with your fastest fingers. Second dessert was an array of strawberries and cream compliments of Sakura season. Great dessert and effort! Lewin Terrace serves wines from Japan which is not common in SG. Their head sommelier Axel was helpful in explaining the wine pairings including details such as the grape varietal, alcohol strength and history of the chateau. Overall we will be back for the food and wine, but will skip the still/sparkling water at S$8 per pax that was tad steep
5
After evaluating many different options my partner (now wife) and I settled on Lewin Terrace as our wedding venue. Lovely venue in the heart of Fort Canning Park and with a nice balance between indoor and shaded outdoor spaces - what more could you ask for.Right from the start, our two in-house professional event planners, Shima-san and Chong Hwee, stepped up to the plate and helped us begin to coordinate the many elements that would be essential in ensuring a successful wedding. Outstanding attention to detail and valuable guidance all round gave us confidence we were in good hands. This attention was maintained all the way up to the day itself, leaving nothing to chance.The day itself passed by in a blur for us, but the feedback from all of our guests was universally excellent - it was an absolutely sensational event and the quality and presentation of each and every dish was perfectly cooked and delicious considering the number of guests involved. As much as everything truly did exceed our expectations, what was most impressive in my view was the astonishing performance from Chef and his brigade - each dish was executed perfectly, from Hokkaido scallop to Japanese Wagyu, everything was plated beautifully and truly delicious.Highly recommended for events both large and small - I actually returned to celebrate my birthday only 3 weeks after the wedding!

Celebrated 9th year anniversary with my partner here. I was contemplating whether to celebrate at 1-michelin star Waku Ghin or Lewin Terrace. I chose the latter due to the swift and friendly staff on the phone during reservation who was all out to please. Lewin Terrace chef entertained our request for a special sea-urchin starter on top of his regular menu. And that we could have a nice alfesco corner for our 7pm dinner. (Waku Ghin reservation experience was not so pleasant. They disregarded our anniversary, insisted our dinner to start at 530pm as they had 2 shifts). We ordered the set menu with wine pairing. We were very impressed with our Japanese sommelier who explained in detail every wine presented to us. Very professional and knowledgeable. He offered an additional glass of white, which was a very nice gesture. When it was time for dessert, the staff photographed us with a camera and presented us our framed photo after. A very touching gesture.Having eaten in many good restaurants here in Singapore and during our travels, what prompt me to write this review are a few folds. Lewin Terrace deserves 5 stars for its reasonably good Jap-French food and wine, a budget that will not burst your wallet. The dining experience is surreal and romantic, but not pretentious. Its service is attentive but unobstrusive.Highly recommended

Called to cancel but was told i would be charged 80% of the valentines day set menu bill, while other restaurants did not have such a policy. Will never book to that restaurant again.
5
The food is great and the service is very warm. The ambience was very good too. Relaxed and calming.
4
The servers could be more attentive. Observe the customer to see if they have finished their bread before dishing out the appetizer. Other than that, servers were well-informed and pleasant to interact with.
5
Lovely dinner, staff was attentive, provided details on each dish upon serving, food was well presented and tasted so good! Quiet atmosphere and perfect for couples.
5
Sitting at the balcony was a good choice.
I like to watch the squirrels jumping from tree to tree while having lunch.
5
They provides food and service sincerely. The environment is also quite nice. Good for photography. It's worthy to spend at Lewin!

Set in a hundred year old black and white historical bungalow on top of hill street, next to the lush Fort Canning Park, you can't ask for a better location than this in urban Singapore. The ambience is romantic and resturant setting works seamlessly with the natural environment (Wear something light and breathable). The are plenty outdoor sittings for romantic rendezvours. Not just the taste and food are a merge of French & Japanese, the presentation, colour, and utensil are also an artful collage. With immaculate attention to details, it is an unique experience to sample how the chef immersed the East and West culinary cultures. There's 8-course $188++ and 6-course $118++ to suit your appetite. Wine pairing add $120++ for 6 glasses, and they have a wonderful collection of excellent wines. Oh yes, you get a generous glass of champagne to start, and great coffee to end. Highly recommended for those looking for an enchanting night
3
The environment is very nice besides the weird entrance through a car park. I was a bit disappointed by the food itself as very few dishes made me think "Wow that's good!". Considering the prices, I was expecting a much better experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful
2
i made a reservation for noon on 31 Jan and called to confirm it. the lady i got on the phone told me that it had not been taken into consideration in the system and it must have been a problem with Chope. i ended up having to call about 10 restaurants to find a new restaurant.On 31 Jan at 12:45, someone from the restaurant calls me to ask if i was still coming...I would expect such a restaurant to be much better organize

Third time in Singapore, this time for business and went to this restaurant to enjoy a great dinner with a colleague I had not seen in 8'years. The taxi drove around until finding the place from where you need to go upstairs more than 35 steps until arriving to the restaurant. Very nice on top of a hill with beautiful tables and you could choose to sit indoors and outdoors. We chose a table for two admiring the quiet view and had a great chat while enjoying a delicious dinner. Food prepared and presented correctly. Wine was ok as well. Prices are not low but this is Singapore. If you want low prices then the malls are the places to find low prices and reasonable foo
5
Had a wonderful lunch experience. Finely presented food with fresh ingredients accompanied with impeccable service. Lush greenery surrounds restaurant.
5
Excellent service, refined food with beautiful setting and presentation nestled in colonial style bungalow
4
We ordered wagyu cheeks with beetroot salad and foie gras as starters and wagyu steak with foie gras and tile fish with black truffle rice with seaweed for mains.
4
I got this recommendation from a friend, and I booked right away a lunch. The atmosphere is very peaceful, the team is knowledgeable and takes time to explain each plate with details. The food is tasty and tastes are combined with lots of Japanese influence. It was appreciated to find a French gentleman in the team who made our lunch experience more personal and with a home touch. We will recommend this place to our friends as a great location for casual lunch or business lunch. We still need to try dinner...
5
The staff were amazing and nothing was too much for them. When their photo machine wasn't working they personally took our photo and printed it out to remember our special anniversary. Food is amazing and is complimented by the fantastic atmosphere. Perched on the edge of the park it feels like you're in a quiet corner of a forest. Would definitely recommend to couples

Lewin terrace is not easy to locate but if you drive, you can park at the philatelic museum (valet available ) and walk up some stairs - you will see a lovely colonial house , black and white. The decor is light , spacious and fresh. There is a historical feeling to the place which adds to the charm.Service is excellent and you get adequate attention too.We tried the Restaurant Week menu...value for money! The appetizer was salmon with maple sugar - strange combination but done well so that the balance between sweet and salmon was just nice , neither dominating the other. The roasted pork with Lewin spice was succulent , nice taste on the tongue, tender. The wagyu steak Nippon-Rossini style was smooth, tender and quite delicate...if you like your meat a bit chewy and robust flavored, this is not for you. Still a very tasty dish and worth a try. The best dish for me was dessert- chitose japanese strawberry in creme brûlée/Nikki . The creme brûlée is so smooth it just glides into your mouth, coats your tongue before slipping down your throat. The strawberries are fresh, sweet and juicy. Amazing dessert. There is a good wine pairing list, and Axel will be able to share his favorites with you whilst suggesting some special wines.Lunch is affordable but dinner is more pricey - more for special or romantic occasions . A very nice setting and good service too
4
We decided to go to this place during the restaurant week without expecting anything special. Actually the service was perfect, the place is an authentic black and White House with a nice terrace and the food in your plate is a good combination of French and Japanese cuisines. Nice discoveries with Japanese wine (bailey blends) and Japanese beef Rossini. To try in the area
3
Food quality was high. My duck was just excellent. But prices are definitely high and arguably a bit too high. But its wine and sake pricing that is just crazy, insultingly high. The wine pricing is very close to a reason not to go to this restaurant
5
I have a soft spot for French Japanese cuisine to start with. I am actually quite impressed by the flavor pairing. Good food being the norm....I shall not speak much on it but compliment on the service offered. It was a classic example of Going the Extra Mile. It was a birthday celebration on a restaurant week promo hence I didn't expect much.... But who knows they even printed a photo and frame it up for us!!!!!! Omg seriously! That's quite an effort

The place was located just behind the Singapore Philatelic Museum. It shared the carpark with the museum with valet service provided. The place was a black and white colonial style bungalow.As there was an event which occupied the indoor dining area, I was showed to a table in the alfresco area. Although there was no aircon, the place was quite cooling. I was having the 3 course French Week promotional lunch set which cost $40++. Amuse-bouche : Sweet Potato SoupThe soup had a taste similar to potato soup but with a sweet taste.This was followed by the bread basket and butter. There was 3 different kinds of bread which were served pipping hot. There was hot stones underneath the bread to keep the bread warm.LES ENTREEs : Galantine/ Japanese Raison "Kyoho"/ Creme De VermouthChicken/ Foie Gras/ Kyoho/ Creme VermouthThe rather unexciting chicken roll was lifted up in taste by the sour and sweet tasting grapes and the sweet pickled onions. LE PLAT : Terrine De Poisson/ Mangue Vert Spagetti/ Sauce AmericainePrawn/ Fish Terrine/ Green Mango Spaghetti/ American SauceThe green mango spaghetti turned out to be shredded mango. It did not taste sour although it was green mango. The fish terrine was more like fish cake with fish meat stuffed in the centre. The americaine sauce was made of crayfish with strong seafood taste, which peak up the otherwise bland fish terrine.LE DESSERT : Creme Brulee Lewin Terrace StyleThe dessert was served in a glass, different from the usual creme brulee. It was pudding, topped with ice cream, banana and caramel crisp. Interesting and did not taste too sweet.Yaki-Imo ($24++)Sweet Potato/ Caramel Ice Cream/ MapleThe dish was presented as sweet potato crispy leave with chocolate branch sticks. I was disappointed that the caramel ice cream was already melted when served. The sweet potato was smooth and creamy, topped with purple sweet potato powder.Overall the dishes were not bad, but still lacking of the wow factor. The place was an interesting cozy one
4
After reading an entry in Yahoo, we decided to try out this place for wifey's b'day celebration.. It was truly an interesting experience.
The food was awesomely good.. and full of flavor and fresh..
5
Multi sensory dining experience, we love every single item in the 2 dinner menus, awesome food that combines creativity and great taste, very friendly and courteous service staff. Thank you for the great experience!
3
Service and setting top notch but underwhelmed by the food. Lobster was overcooked too. The flavors of ingredients did not shine through although presentation was beautiful.
5
Elegant lunch venue.
Delicate food that pleases the palate without overwhelming it.
Courteous, friendly service.
An excellent restaurant, perfect for quiet tete-a-tete
3
Location was very secluded and not that easy to find. The ambience was great, love the old black and white old charm sort of feel. Food though was so underwhelming for the price. And my risotto was undercooked. I will not be back.
5
This is at a old colonial house and entrance is by the Masonic Club at Coleman street. Excellent ambience - old world charm. Everyone there I think was Japanese and i could see why it would appeal to them. Excellent high tea location. We came for lunch. Simple set at $38 but by the time we ordered all the extras I think it was closer to $70. No regrets at all. Spanish uni and toufu as starters. Fish had so much flavour and they showed us how they got extra flavour in the broth. It was great!!! Would come here again.
4
We chose this place to celebrate my niece's graduation. The restaurant is really thoughtful and arranged a series of small surprises for her. We are really touched by the gesture. Thank you for making her day so special. Food is well presented and tasty. Nice ambience too with friendly staff. Will definitely be back agai

I attended a event organized by Citibank for a 6 course gourmet dinner at this restaurant on the 24 June 2016. This was my first time dining at this restaurant. DÃ©cor and service wise it sure was an excellent choice. The only letdown was the miniscule food portions. I have attended several same events organized by Citibank in other restaurants and this was the only time I was left peckish after dinner. The food portion was really tiny and looking at them as tasting portion was really just an euphemism for cutting cost, which I thought it was NOT meant to be tasting portion judging from other similar events I have been to. Unless the restaurant usual serving size is more than what I tasted, I will not recommend this restaurant

We went to celebrate a birthday and sat outside on the colonial verandah. From the Japanese/French menu we chose one 5-course and one 7-course tasting and both were excellent. The wine pairing menu is excellent value and features a couple of Japanese white wines, which was a first for us. Excellent sommelier and service staff. Also easy parking. Highly Recommended

I first reviewed Lewin Terrace fairly shortly after it opened in 2014, but I think it has come on significantly since then, hence the follow up review.Lewin Terrace occupies the old Fire Chief's villa set high among the trees on the edge of Fort Canning, where the old Flutes in the Fort restaurant used to be. You approach it through the car park of the Philatelic Museum on Coleman Street, and there are several flights of stairs that take you up to the restaurant. It's all signposted, though, and not difficult to find.The setting is lovely. Most of the table are on the colonial style verandah, and the surrounding trees make it hard to believe that you're in the middle of a busy city. Overhead fans kept it just about cool enough for me and my wife was delighted not to be eating in the customary chill of an air conditioner!The menu is a wonderful fusion of French and Japanese. You've got the choice of a la Carte or five or seven course tasting menus. We went for the seven course tasting menu and it was excellent - an interesting mix of flavours that complemented each other very well, for example the foie gras and corn seed brulee was heavenly!The service was also very good, although the place was probably only half full on the Thursday night we visited. I chose the wine flight which included some excellent Japanese wines served by a sommelier who really know his stuff.I recommend this place highly, and I shall undoubtedly return

The Japanese chef at Lewin delivered good quality food for a reasonable price, and catered to the family's celebration request as well. Would definitely recommend this as a family or couple place!
5
Had a fantastic experience with dinner for 4. Price is expensive but the food is surreal and fabulous. Service and ambience is very good. Had a very good time. Thank you

This place is so lovely. It's like an oasis in the city. The food is well presented but very small in portion. Attentive and friendly staff.
4
Wonderful service and experience. However Food is somewhat less of an experience in regards to taste.
4
Wonderful atmosphere, great food, excellent service. Happy that the missus loved it too. Grateful that the restaurant went the extra mile to prepare a complimentary birthday treat for my wife
5
My boyfriend bought me here for a treat as he passed his IPPT! Yes, it was quite a long flight of stairs up before arriving at the restaurant. Nevertheless, it was worth the climb! We were greeted warmly by the staff and their hospitality was really great! We ordered ala carte, namely Japanese waygu steak, Meat of the Day (Beef cheek), Prawn Bique and fondue cake. All dishes tasted great! They also served us bread and some appetizers before the meal. The ambience was awesome with dim yellow lights and we had outdoor seating but there were not a sign of mosquitoes! Will come again definitely!
4
As I said - really nice place, close to Fort Canning Park. Nice terrace, nice setting. Service is good, and there were some very nice dishes. Tuna tataki was great, and Wagyu beef was definitely the best peace of Wagyu I ever had.That being said, there are some things that can be improved - nothing major, but still... That is the only reason why I didn't give this place a top rating, but it is definitely worth a visi
5
We had a delicious lunch here, the food, service, ambiance and location exceeded my expectations. We opted for the 5 course lunch menu with wine pairing, it was exquisite! We sat on the outside deck and it was idyllic, an oasis in the heart of a bustling city. If you appreciate top quality food at (by international standards) reasonable prices, then please have a try. The location is not the easiest to find.

While searching for a new place to go for my birthday celebration, I came across this Japanese-French restaurant. The menu sounded interesting so decided to go for it because I love French & I love Japanese, but haven't try a Japanese-French fusion cuisine before. The entrance to this restaurant is a bit tricky to find. You need to enter through a red gate into a car park right next to Singapore Philatelic Museum. Then take a flight of staircase up to reach the main entrance to this white colonial house. Ambience is nice with both indoor & outdoor. Service is wonderful in fact quite fast for a fine dining (but if u prefer slow service with a bit of time between each dish, you can request for it) we decided to go for the "Omotenashi" dinner set. In addition, we ordered the pan fried Foie Gras that we enjoyed so much. The head chef came to the table to greet us, a pleasant surprised because he is a young chef! Also at the end they even took a photo of us & frame it as a present for us to take home!!
4
Limited parking for the restaurant is situated between the Masonic Club and the Philatelic Museum and is shared with patrons of all three establishments. A short walk and an approximate 50 step climb brings you to the entrance of Lewin.Handicap access is from the rear of the restaurant and prior arrangement needs to be made.Service was attentive but not obtrusive. Servings were amble and creative. The duck was stringy. We were celebrating a birthday and appreciated the complimentary dessert and framed photo that was presented to us
5
Outstanding and memorable. The food was creative, tasty and a work of art. Service was impeccable. Congratulations.
3
This is a nice place to visit for a special occasion. The ambience is rather nice and cosy, but expect up to 5-6 tables in a small room, that may seems a little claustrophobic.
5
Took my wife there for her birthday and was not disappointed. Getting there involves some degree of stair-climbing, but the payoff is a very private and romantic setting to enjoy food that is lovingly prepared. I would highly recommend sitting outdoors!
5
Second time in half a year.
The food was still as good as the first time I went.
The meats are always impeccably cooked.
The location is quaint and quiet. Perfect for a date.
5
I went to the restaurant with my husband for our wedding anniversary. Having heard rave reviews, of course I was having high expectations. I am pleased to say the place delivered and all the food were presented really prettily. Thank goodness they tasted good too - especially the beef carpaccio and wagyu. Only minus was that they did have the duck the night we were there
2
It's always sad to see the quality of a good restaurant go down - took 30 minutes to bring the champagne and once it had arrived, it was flat. They served us "warm" white wine as well. When we suggested that the restaurant should not charge us for the champagne (3 glasses) to make up for the poor service we experienced, they refused and insisted that we pay....Average food with POOR service at a pricey restaurant....good luck with that
5
Outdoor ambience is actually better, but as i want aircon, so i selected indoor table. The place is quiet and romantic! We paid extra to add on Sake pairing, there is 4 glasses of sake cocktail come with the dish. It is very good as the sake flavour is tailored n best match with ur dish! Since it is a jap-french fusion restaurant, i find every dish very interesting and creative!! And the taste is good!! Every dish got some surprise! The waitor would give detail introduction of the food n its ingredients in each dish they serve. I find them very professional. I ordered seafood as main course while my hubby ordered duck, he said the duck is ok but he likes my seafood more. The dessert look great n taste good as well! The whole experience in Lewin terrace is perfect!! We have a very happy night there!! Just 1 unpresent thing is that we followed google Map, it located the restaurant in the middle of the hill... Then we walk 1 big round, n find that the entrance is not in the hill but ground floor... (Actually the waitor taught me how to get there during the booking confirmation, it just i m not local, so i cant exactly get the location she mentioned.) anyway, this is google map's fault~ It tagged a wrong location.

Fusion of french and japanese cuisines is surprisingly and interestingly compatible. Challan duck was perfectly doused with red wine and miso sauce, giving it a full bodied taste. The seared hokkaido scallop is very flavourful and tender. Even the simple buns with butter dolloped with yuzu and miso sauce are quite nice. Would definitely return again to try out more food
2
A disappointment. I selected the place for the romantic dinner which has stated that there will be a special card for the birthday boy and photo for remembrance. Although this was requested when the booking was made, there was no follow through! Nothing special was done! The place was noisy due to a group having business dinner! Nothing special or romantic at all. Food is average for the price we paid
5
The staff was so attentive and made us feel special. Being vegetarians, it was really hard to find a full 5 course meal that is as inventive and delicious as this. The big surprise came later on when they presented our picture in a frame! This gesture is so thoughtful and really made the night special. Highly recommended and really one of the best experiences we have ever had in a restaurant
4
Was there to celebrate my partner's birthday. Enjoyed the service by the attentive staff, food is of good quality and the ambience is relax and has an old world charm
4
Nice French-Japanese fusion dinning in Singapore. Good use of ingredient and the wine pairing option is a good one. Great services too!

Perfect sums up our evening! Set in a recently renovated colonial bungalow amongst beautiful nature it was he perfect romantic dinner for my partner and I to spend our anniversary. I was initially undecided if I should take and indoor or outdoor seating as I was worried about the heat and mosquitoes. A quick email to Lewin Terrace and they got me a table outdoors under the fan and I could see mosquito coils burning discretely in a corner. Thank god I chose outdoor as it was a really cool evening and not a single bite! When I went indoors to use the bathroom it was so cold inside!The menu consists of 2 set menus ($168, $108) and ala carte. We went Ala carte cause we could not find a set menu that had everything we wanted to try. Out of 4 appetizers 2 were excellent (Hokkaido Crab & Bonito fish) the soup and salad were average. For the mains we had the Cod fish which was great but serving abit small and the lamb which was delicious, juicy and succulent but a little fatty. We ordered a chocolate soufflÃ© which was really really nice and they added 2 slices of brownies and a scope of ice cream on the house as we were celebrating our anniversary. They even took a picture of us and gave it to us in a frame which was really a nice touch and we loved it. Service was always attentive and never intrusive and The chef even came out to say hello at the end it was really a nice touch. All in all the bill came out as expected of such a beautiful place and food but it was all the little touches that the restaurant took to heart that made this evening perfect. We left feeling so impressed and would no doubt come back here again in the future.
5
They had a wonderful set for women on Tue with free flow of Presecco, of which they were very well paired with the meal that we had. The food was beautifully plated and it was such a sight to have and it was even better when it reaches the happy end of our pallette. Plus we had a wonderful host Mr Axel who took time to explain the dishes and made it a wonderful experience for us. I would also like to compliment the other service stuff that also was very professional was Mr Mahendra, keep up the good work, we are certainly coming back to try the rest of the tasting menu. 
5
Reservation done in a jiffy through Chope, where I indicated that it's my partner's birthday and if they could do something special. Got a call from the restaurant within minutes to confirm the birthday boy's name and a description of what's to come. It was a quiet night and I got a wee bit worried when we arrived,wondering if the food would be up to standard. It was a baseless, unnecessary concern. Food was awesome and the chef put together a little birthday dessert.Service was impeccable and all our needs were met. Love the ambience which was romantic, peaceful and we felt totally undisturbed and in our own space.
5
I only have great things to say about this restaurant! My husband and I went here for my birthday dinner and it was pissing down that night. The staff were ever so helpful and fetched us by the road to bring umbrellas and help us get to the restaurant. Set in a beautiful house, the food was fantastic (french-japanese fusion)- I will never look down on bitter gourd again! The wines were excellent and a discovery experience as they also have Japanese wines to serve (found my new favourite white wine here!). The Sommelier was so genuine and nice we felt at ease. He did an excellent job pairing the wines with the food. A must try when in Singapore
5
celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary last night, lewin terrace staff kindly held our reservation for us till 9pm which was the last order for the set meals.2 different set meals, different no of courses, both highly recommended. every single dish is to die for, especially the main courses of roasted lamb and wagyu beefhad wine pairing for the 108 set, thoroughly worth it. asst sommelier is from japan, knows his wines well.we were served by the main waiter, who explained every single dish. complimentary dessert for our anniversary and to top it off, they took a photo for us and framed it up within minutes as a gift to us.parking with valet right at the bottom of stairs.5 stars for the ambience, 6 stars for service and quality of food!can't wait to be back agai

Food: Value for money. They have a-la-carte for dinner, set dinner ($168/$108). If you are small eater, go for $108. They have wine pairing too.Ambience: Very good and cozy + romanticService: 4.5 / 5The ambience will makes me want to go back there again, not s much on the food

Tucked in a colonial bungalow, Lewin's location is unique but still easily accessible from either Dhoby Ghaut mrt or bras Brasah mrt. I have been there in the day time which looks really lovely for weekend brunch but was surprised that it is even better at nighttime. It is romantic and quiet .We sat indoor for main course but switched to outdoor for desserts. It was a warm day but didn't feel warm al fresco at Lewin. Probably coz of the trees. And no Mosquitos too!( which is common at Rochester area colonial restaurants)Food - it is fine dining food.we ordered the foie gras terrine, hokkaido scallop flambee. The foie gras pate was smooth and comes with complementing sauce and garnishes. The hokkaido scallop was quite a dramatic presentation, literally served on she'll and flames. Three big whole scallops which is pretty generous. They were perfectly seared with an interesting sauce which I wished I could drink it!The mains - we had the kyoto style cod and the grilled challan duck. The cod was perfectly done with a tasty but not too salty sauce. The duck breast was cooked just nice and very tender.Desserts - peach compote and Choco mousse. The peach compote was refreshing and Choco mousse very chocolatey. Total price was about $200 for both of us without alcohol. I will definitely go back to eat again

First the ambience is terrific.The restaurent sits on the top of a flight of stairs.Beautiful green surroundings and a peaceful atmosphere.The food is excellent.We had the set Omakaze meal.Be prepared for an amazing variety of tastes.Every course was beautifully presented.Mr Rashid the ever friendly restaurent manager explained each course .Service was excellent.Price paid was worth the experience.Will definately visit again

We decided to try out this place for dinner. They serve an excellent combination of French Japanese cuisine. Great service, excellent food. Love this place. 2 thumbs up. Amazing flavors!
4
The place is quiet, embedded in the lush greenery, I really like the ambience and the food served there. The staff were very attentive to our needs and they made my birthday surprise possible. Thank you!
5
We came here with my team and no words to say how much we did appreciate it. Wine, food, atmosphere, everything was perfect.
4
It was wonderful and creative food. The lunch menu needs to be improved for price and time sensitivities.
5
The food is great. Service is superb. Ambience five stars! Awesome overall experience, especially the surprise birthday treat and photo given to me in a photo frame. Highly recommend this place for special occasions!
5
I brought my partner here for his birthday. We both ordered the 'Otameshi' (6-course meal). We enjoyed the variety of flavour throughout the meal and we thought the service was really good. The service staff were attentive without being overly fussy. Apart from the complimentary birthday dessert, they even printed our photo and put it in a small frame as a souvenir for us. We'd definitely come back here again to celebrate other special occasions

Lewin Terrace is a jewel.The location is very serene and interesting, a beautiful black & white colonial bungalow, nestled among Fort Canning's greenery. The place is quiet and romantic, with a lot of alfresco tables.The service was by far the best i ever had in a decade spent in Singapore. Polite, knowledgeable, very helpful, generous staff, with a lot of touching attention. At the end of the meal, the chef is meeting the guests and politely greeting them, in the best of the Japanese haute cuisine tradition.The food was sumptuous. A la carte is always possible and tempting, but that night we had some special omakase course made by chef Keisuke Matsumoto. Inventive, artistically arranged, with subtle pairings and combinations, the different parts of the course were fabulous. Of course, the bill was a bit high, but there are hundreds of more expensive restaurants in Singapore where you won't have such a great meal. With its great location and layout, its expert staff and wonderfully subtle food, Lewin Terrace is the epitome of fine dining, yet with humility - a real jewel, indee

I brought a friend there for dinner to celebrate his birthday because I knew he didn't enjoy commercialised shopping mall restaurants and the like. He is french and generally dislikes French cuisine in Singapore, hence Lewin Terrace is a good combination of French and Japanese fusion. The restaurant is easy to find, although it can be a challenge if it rains and you don't drive (which we don't). My reservation was placed at 7.30pm but we decided to head there earlier as we were hungry and arrived at 6.40pm. The restaurant manager graciously accommodated the change in our dinner time. Lewin Terrace is every bit like its pictures but better. Tables are spacious and chairs are comfortable. We had an Omakase set menu for dinner. Food is a pairing of unlikely ingredients which tasted pleasant. True to Japanese cuisine, dinner is well balanced and just enough for you to be full but not so that you'll have a hard time walking afterwards. You did not have to wait too long for food to be served. Service was unobtrusive and attentive, the wait staff were not pushy. Set menu prices are on the high side but very value for money. However, we were the only other table dining on a sunday evening. It is very pleasant if you dislike crowds and noise, and truly is a hidden little gem in town.

If one appreciates its location (in a colonial black and white house), Lewin Terrace presents an almost perfect combo of beautiful culinary experience in a unique Singaporean setting! The kaiseki style appetizer is pleasing to all the senses, paired with Japanese wine, followed by main dish with a french twist. Both the set menus and a la carte have plenty choices to dazzle (and perhaps confuse to those who simply cannot make up their mind). Japanese influence is more obvious on our dinner menu. One could also choose to sit on the balcony, very romantic setting as others have commented. In summary, well worth the "trouble" getting there ... one last note: for those geographically challenged, please call in advance for directions. Trying to find your way thru Fort Canning at night is not recommended, although it sounds very appealing indeed
4
I'm truly not a fan of fusion but this was a surprise dinner for me otherwise, I would have never considered this restaurant. As I'm a picky eater and have dietary restrictions, I was pleasantly surprised by the Omakase set which was modified to suit my palate and the Takahata Japanesque Bailey's Blend was a lovely and light red (could have drank the whole bottle myself). They forgot to modify the dessert for me but that was fine as I was completely stuffed by the end of the evening.The ambience was what really made the evening. Service was unobtrusive and was much better than I had expected (given that it was Singapore where there are far more misses than hits). Would also recommend going for a post-dinner stroll around the park as it is quite lovely (minus the croaking of the bullfrogs?) :
5
What a hidden little gem this place is, outstanding service and perfect food in a very romantic setting. Highly recommend. They made us feel very special on our anniversary.
5
the place is wonderful and quite for a romantic dinner! the food was tasty and very well presented. good choice of wines as well. The service is great and not disturbing you. I recommend this place!!
4
first time visit Singapore , found this spot lovely staff... food was amazing absolutely will come back.
5
I got engaged here. The food and service was wonderful. We sat out on the terrace to enjoy the night air. Each dish from the prix fixe was artistically created. A quite and romantic evening I'll always remember. A Singapore gem.

First of all, the restaurant is not easy to find. After you get off the car, you have to walk up the small hill to reach the house.The restaurant is quite cozy. It offers a few set menus to choose from. It also offers a la carte.We picked one of the set menus. The amuse bouche was baked cheese balls which would be too filling if we ate them all. So we just sampled the amuse bouche. Then came the bread. I expected better types of bread to choose from so I found it disappointing.The appetizers were eight different sushis. The problem with a Japanese french fusion restaurant is that the quality of conventional Japanese dishes is not up to the standard of a sushi restaurant. So I found the sushi to be average.The foie gras was good. But I found the lamb to be average at best
5
It is a hidden gem located in the Fort Canning area. The restaurant is set in a colonial style bunglow and is very chic.It serves a fusion of French and Japanese cuisine - pretty unique but very very well done. Besides being absolutely delicious, the food presentation is fantastic
5
Lewin Terrace is located in fort Canning, at the back of the Fire Station, where Flutes used to be.Going there is a bit challenging in this rainy season as ladies are always afraid to get soaked on the way from the parking to the restaurant, a good hundred meters away. Lewin terrace is quite quiet on the communication front, not many of my friends know of it. The location, an old colonial (black and white) house, is as nice as it ever was, there is a beautiful dining area outside and cosy room indoors. The style is a mix of colonial and modern decoration, nice for a restaurant, but nothing to fall from your chair (luckily).The food is claimed to be french-Japanese fusion; being french I would say it's definitely more Japanese with a french twist; but you can have a very french like dinner with fois gras and duck as my son had. We concentrated on the Hokkaido menu (148 SGD per pax) and that was really a treat; the seafood started platter was a delight. Including see urchins and other delicacies this was definitely Japanese. The pan seared Hokkaido scallop was delicious and its presentation was ... fiery. I had a wonderful wagyu beef while the restaurant was nice enough to serve half a lobster to my wife who does not eat beef. Even the soba noodles which were served afterwards were interesting. Finally the desert based on famous Hokkaido mangoes was also very enjoyable.May I also indicate that the service was also very nice and efficient; chef Ryoichi Kano, coming directly from Japan, came to our table to say hello.A couple of minor negative points:- the mineral water is freeflow but at 8 SGD per head, this is too expensive (do I sound mean?)- the wine list is not bad, but from the web site I though there would be a wider selection (I am particular to french whites), such a quality of food deserves better.- as I said before some diners may be affraid to go during rainy season, but the place was quit empty on a saturday night; I hope this review will help bringing more guests.In conclusion, this is a very enjoyable experience, the food is very high level, its quality and style brings it in the range of some of the best restaurants in Singapore

This restaurant has recently opened in a lovely colonial building that used to be the fire chiefs home. The owners have retained the colonial feel so supper is served on the verandah with views into the surrounding trees. It's difficult to believe that you are only a few steps away from the bustling city.The menu is Japanese French fusion food. We had the tasting menu but there is an a la carte menu available if you prefer. The food was lovely and some of the combinations inspired. My only criticism is that if anything the portions were rather too large so that I almost couldn't manage the last couple of courses.The staff are very pleasant but just missed out on a five star rating as they are a little inexperienced - this should resolve itself with time. I for one will definitely be back
5
Quiet and almost hidden location in the city centre of Singapore, perfect quality of food with impressive presentation! Very friendly service, even the very sympathic Chef greeted his guests. Large terrace to enjoy some hours outside. Perfect joice of drinks - even Monkey Gin from Black Forest offered! Very nice experience, worth while coming back

I chose the wine flight and a fresh glass of wine or sake was brought to the table with each course. However, I would have preferred the wine to have been poured at the table so I could see the bottle and its provenance. This is a small point though, and didn't detract from the overall very enjoyable experience.I recommend this place highly, and I shall undoubtedly return
