Back again and this time, had some sort of berry cake and a chocolate cake. The berry cake was light, fluffy and punctuated by sourness and acidity. Nice. The chocolate cake was a little bit of omg- dense, chocolaty, with the right proportion of cake and cream, it was good! But it was also a bit too rich and we couldn't finish. Will probably be back for another attempt to finish that chocolate cake

My friend recommended this place, I am not sure if it is newly opened. There are lot of variety of the cakes and we choose the slightly sour one - Yuzu Raspberry Cake as thinking not to have to sweet version. Our selection is correct, taste good. The cafe only serve tea without coffee

What a lovely place to have delicious cakes & tea in a very pleasant environment attended to by an attentive & helpful server. The cake, tea & ambience together ushered me away from the rush of city life into the calm and serene place of rest and restoration.Please note that they don't serve coffee (only tea, soda or water)
