Located in a residential area, this is a chill place to hangout with friends. It boasts an impressive retro ambience with an informal, yet prompt and commendable service. The seemingly random deco intrigues the visitors and is probably a unique choice for a restaurant.The menu has a decent number of vegetarian dishes.The pasta is amazing with a perfect balance of spices. Cheese nachos serve as a good appetiser. On the whole, it's a restaurant which cannot be visited just once

I have been here for a number of times with different group of friends. Yet every time it never fails to impress us when it comes to the food quality. The restaurant has a retro ambience and is a great choice for casual gatherings for family or friends. The kind, helpful owner also gives reliable recommendations on serving portions and choice of foods.MUST TRY: - Otak Pizza- Mashed Potatoes- Papachos- Pork Knuckles- Earl Grey Light Cream Cak

The ambience and the range of craft beers here are very good. The staff were also friendly and helpful, however the Mexican food was awful. We got Nachos and a burrito. The Nachos were basically hard chips with weird cheese that tasted like it was cooked in an unclean oven-you can taste the oven grime. There wasn't much else on it. The Burrito wasn't a burrito, but a quesadilla with the same awful cheese and very little else inside. We also had to wait an hour to be served the food as, according to the staff, the first 'burrito' was burnt and had to be remade. If you decide to come here do not order Mexican food as they do not know how to make it

The food here is one of the best I had, especially the pizza, the otah pizza, I can safely say that you'd never had a really good pizza until you step in their doors and order the otah pizza And now for the drinks, they have an array of craft beers and they are all amazing, of one does not suit your style you would definitely find out that you'll love.On a side note the service here is also amazing, they are all very friendly and helpful. And could even have a friendly chat with them. They have one of the best service you can find in Singapore Lee Tai Fu, a truly amazing place where you just can't come here once and forget about it, this place will just attract you back for more

This restaurant is very famous for its signature dishes such as pork knuckle, otah pizza, signature pasta and etc. Went second time with friends and try the otah pizza, a creative fusion that merges cheese, ikan biris, otah and chili paste, only in this restaurant you can find such a smooth clash of east and west ingredients. Tried the signature pasta as well which has a very unique taste, again a fusion of chinese fry noddle style using western ingredient. We were lucky today is Malaysia Independence day and we are offered some free dishes because we were Malaysian

Last Friday, I was searching for mexican food and this restaurant pop up. We made a long trip from Novena to Tiong Bahru to see if it's any good. Since it's kinda mixed up menu likes western, local and mexican. I wasn't really sure how the food gonna turn out. I played safe by letting my hubby ordered his dish first. He ordered Fajita Chicken which turned out to be Stir Fried Black Pepper Chicken. It wasn't taste any Cumin, Chipotle Chili, Cilantro or any jalapeño in it. All we taste was only strong black pepper with cucumber, green bell pepper, red bell pepper and onions with black watery sauce. This dish came with salsa from jar and Guacamole Squeeze Tube.. The Guacamole part was very yuck. It was my first time and I hope this will be my last to get guacamole from tube. My hubby state his dish as Chinese food for mexican style. It was tasty dish BUT it was NOT a real Mexican. So, after those food experienced I didn't order any more food.. you know why? Drinks ;- F H (Full name of beer can't type here or even covered up with stars still can't) it was a beer from Germany in green bottle my hubby was happy with it. He said it was quite good. - Kopparberg Strawberry Cider served with ice wasn't my favorite. I had this bottle at other craft beers place in Bangkok and circular road before which served in champagne glass.. Much better taste than in beer glass with full of Ice. The price was OK. The menu was nett which includes service charge and GSt. Total bill was 49S$The decorations looks very cute from all rare collection of dolls, models and curios. The gentleman with the long hair which we both guess that he was the owner was very polite and friendly. The service by him was attentive. Would we made other return trip? Obviously, Not. For me, food win over alcohol. You got me to drink a lot, if you serve an authentic dishes plus a lot of craft beer and ciders near my home.
