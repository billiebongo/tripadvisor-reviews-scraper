As far as Holland Village this place seems to have the best balance of beer and food combination. Pizza was great! Thin crust, cooked just right. They have quite a few beers on tap and lots and lots of whisky. Definitely will return.

New system for ordering drinks and food is pretty poor. Information about drink sizes/measures are not available. Only 1 iPad per table so very difficult or people to browse and discuss. When asked for an old fashion menu I was told none were available. The system also crashed and needed to be reset once. The food is great but I will only order take away from now on.Dining is a social experience so you don’t want one person in the group having to manage ordering food and drinks

Brought some colleagues and friends to Crust and was amazed as usual by the service, the awesome pizza and their great selection of whisky and beers! Pure blonde low carb beer for $7.50 and Guinness stout pint for $9!!!! Gosh! Such great value and such great service! I am not sure if anywhere else in Holland or in Singapore do you get this!Kudos to Shannon! The manager of this place! ❤️❤️❤

this is one of the worst pizzas in Singapore. we tried the place 3 months back and did not like it at all. recently we moved to holland village and decided to give it another shot....pepperoni comes with onions and green peppers, the sauce on the pizza is raw and disgusting....highly recommend to skip this plac

My son loves the 4 cheese pizza at Crust. The branch at my village in serangoon gardens is small and has a shared space with common man coffee roasters so depending on the time of day you may not get seats. We usually get a takeaway. Service is always friendly and prompt regardless which staff is on duty. Ingredients are fresh and the pizza dough is light and fluffy
5
The staff swiftly seated us at a convenient table (right under a fan!), and ordering was simple on the provided tablet. The food was brought out hot as it was ready, and ordering extra drinks was easy.Gluten-free options were simple and easy to trust, as the staff also knew about gluten.Will definitely go again on another visit to Singapore

This pizza place is great because it caters to all tastes. I'm a glue free/vegetarian and they have a superb option in their menu. Their prices are good and service pretty fast. You can make your order using their iPads and it's very convenient. Parking place is public and very close by. I recommend booking first during the weekends

Visited with my family of 4 on a Sat evening.Ordered Hawaiian pizza and HH Sausage duo + Margarita pizza. The pizza are ok, crust is crispy and is prepared when ordered (so be prepared to wait for 20 minutes). I find the Margarita pizza a bit bland in taste and has too little mozzarella cheese.My girls loved the truffle wedges and truffle fries too.The house pour Carbanet Sauvignon is served cold and hence could have tasted better. It is 1-for-1 (all day if I am not wrong).Service is friendly though it seems like there is only 1 guy serving the customers. Loved the alfresco seating.Spent $112 for 4. Not sure that's value for money.Note:If you plan to have the pizza one at a time (just like we do), order the next one when you are half way through the 1st. Choose outdoor seats to enjoy the ambience and watch the crowd

Visited the restaurant with my Daughter for lunch on a Saturday and found the street surprisingly quiet. A good range of quality pizzas on the menu but went for the Waygu Beef pizza and was not disappointed. I usually find Waygu beef too oily for my taste but it really goes well on a thin crispy crust with an array of mushrooms and fresh spinach. Highly recommended if your are ever in Holland Village ang hungry

We visited this place with a group of 10-12 colleagues for lunch. The place was completely empty & we were the only people eating at this place. There was only one person in the whole restaurant taking care of everything. We ordered different varieties of of pizzas to cater to the different needs. The crust was very thin and initial impression was that the taste would be good. But the end result wasn't so encouraging. The crust was prepared in advance and only the tomato sauce & toppings were added later. It was as if we bought the pizza from a supermarket & heated it before eating. Would not recommend it as there are many other places which serve much better pizza with good quality.

Had the rectangle piripiri chicken pizza. On the menu the pictures look great and in fact the rectangle pizza comes out looking good, but the taste and quality isn't there. The overall flavour is pretty bland and the cheese is really low quality. The base tastes frozen not fresh. It's not the worst pizza but given the concept of gourmet, you'd expect better quality than a frozen oven pizza, which is more or less what you get here.

Missing pizzas especially with euro cup on and decided to head down for a ice cold beer and also my favourite morrocan lamb pizza. Taste as awesome as ever! Crispy crust. Great fresh toppings. The flavours are amazing! Can't believe such a pizza possible! Yumz!And there is a whisky bar colocated with them. Selling a wide range of whisky and at affordable bottle prices. So you get a bottle of nikka barrel for about $100 bucks instead of $20 per shot at wala wala. That's 20 shots at least or $5 per shot! Wow

Sorry guys. I'm not sure how crust has been given 4 stars. I tried them a second time and was extremely disappointed. Some notables:- 1.5 hour wait- the child test - they really didn't like the pizzas- the gluten free test - not bad, toppings average- the quality of toppings. - nope- the pizza - cold- price - crazy expensive- delivery Prive - crazy!Overall I won't buy here again. Sorry all.

Ordered takeaway for our Chinese reunion dinner this year. Wanted something different. Tried a variety of pizzas. The chicken with pesto was pretty delicious. But I did not enjoy the thick crust. I guess I prefer thin crust pizzas. Pricing wasn't cheap too. Our family still prefers Pepperoni Pizzas over this.

Crust is a gourmet Australian pizza chain that has two outlets in Singapore, which is fantastic, because they have a gluten free menu. The gluten free pizza base comes at a small extra cost and the menu clearly identifies which pizza toppings are gluten free. The Holland Village outlet is in a street bustling with other restaurants and bars, so it is definitely worth the 20 minute MRT ride from the city. It's not cheap, but the pizzas are nicer than average and gluten free options are limited in Singapore

Just ordered take away from Crust as I have recently developed a gluten intolerance. Service was good on the phone. However, the pizza (which was only a margarita) when it arrived was a huge disappointment.... There was hardly any basil on it, it was overladen with cheap cheese (highly doubt it was mozzarella!) that tasted really funny with a few bits of mozzarella on top (as if there wasn't enough cheese already!). Sauce - what little I could taste of it was also not very good. Tasted like it came out of a can. To top it all off it was an hr and half before it was delivered (granted that was due to bad weather) which meant it was cold by the time I got it.If maybe proper mozzarella was used, no cheap overcooked cheese and decent amount of basil used it might have made this whole experience a bit worthwhile

Decided to eat here after very attractive menu photos. And the menu is very interesting. Different kind of pizza topping. So decided to give it a try. The service was good providing good input to our order. So we ordered half seafood and half Moroccan lamb. The pizza came and it looked very pretty. The fist taste of my seafood was very flat and bland. So I did try the moroccan lamb. It had even less taste. We were thinking about asking for salt but figure that maybe they were going for less salt diet. :) well finished our food but likely will not come back for the pizza. One nice thing about this place is location. It is a good spot for ppl watching. :

They lose points from me. When I stopped by last night I found that wine by the glass has been taken off the menu. You can order by the bottle but I moved on because I really wanted to enjoy just one glass of wine with my pizza. Surely it is not that difficult to keep one only red and a white open for customers, at $12 a glass you can't lose on it. Bah humbug

The pizzas here are really great!I'm vegetarian and the veg options are also excellent. I like the option of half-half pizza. They are also light and non-greasy. I've been here multiple times and will not mind going back again.Services is good too and prices as reasonable

I highly recommend this restaurant for carb deprived gluten intolerant friends. I tried their chicken pesto and spinach pizzas with gluten free crust and a greek salad on the side. You can tell from the very first bite that the crust is unlike the regular gluten laden crusts. The pizza was full of toppings, but surprisingly, lacks flavoring. More salt and pepper would have been nice. They even serve wheat free beer. Very impressed with the selection. Greek salad could use more feta cheese though. I went to their Holland Village location and ate alfresco style. a bit warm for an August afternoon, but surroundings were nice. It's been a day and I haven't had a reaction from eating their pizzas, so can vouch they are indeed gluten free. I will be back

The pizzas here are different. They use high quality ingredients and basically are putting interesting meals on a pizza crust. Good on them - great idea, great flavour combinations and we will go back!

I went with my friends and we randomly ordered few pizzas and it ended in a wonderful experience. The place is located at the heart of HV. Service is very fast and deserves extra credit. They will make seating arrangements based on your comfort . We started out with Veg pizzas and were amazed to find even Margherita was really good. Then we ordered Veg Supreme, peri peri chicken and garlic bread and everything was quite promising. Their in house wine is also worth a try. Overall it was a great experience which was further enhanced by courtesy of their staff. They take last order at 11 45, so one has ample time to roam around and go there at the end to satisfy their taste buds.

Groupon now offers a 30% discount hence we decided to try the pizzas out. The variety of toppings is amazing, the service so friendly and pizza is absolutely yummy. So good that I bought another groupon to go again. Can't wait for the next visit. The place is small and crowded on a Friday night so grab your table early. Fortunately the service is fast, portions decent and fresh ingredients used. I love that the pizza comes in a rectangle shape and they allow 2 different toppings in one pizza so we can try more variety at one go. Must try their sze chuan prawns toppings as it's unique. http://www.crustpizza.com.s

Happened to visit on week days evening for dinner. They have good option for vegetarian and suprised to see 2-in-1 Pizza can order two different flavours within one pizza. My daughter was very excited about 2-in-1 Pizza. We like the Vegetarian supreme, taste was different with walnut and cherry tomatoes. The chocolate Profiteroles is tasty but tiramisu is not that tasty

Visited here on a pleasant evening. Party of three ordered two pizzas which were served promptly on wooded platters. Pizzas were hot, good and had plenty of cheese. Service / wait time was average, but server was very friendly and pleasant, and we were not in a hurry. The sidewalk tables are excellent vantage points to view the activities of Holland Village

Through mislaid dinner plans, found ourselves walking along UTR in search of a late night eat, where we found Crust. Nearing closing time the servers were extremely polite young gentlemen, asked us place and pay for our order at the counter. About 15 mins later a delicious, hot, crisply baked, thin crust, square-shaped chicken piri-piri pizza came to our table. Now maybe it's because we were super hungry... But hot-damn that was one of the best pizza I've had in Singapore for a long time. Tasty

Heard of them the first time when I received their flyer in the mail. Got a Vegetarian Supreme & Bruschetta pizza home delivered. The delivery was on time and the pizzas were warm, which was awesome. The Veggie Supreme was delicious - it was chockful of toppings and the sweet mayo drizzle was a clincher. The Bruschetta was not bad but it was more an onion tomato pizza. There was no basil, garlic, or balsamic. This one probably requires a name change! I'd definitely recommend getting pizza from here - the crust was just the right thickness - not too thick, not too thin, and the size just right - 8 medium sized squares

Their equivalent of garlic bread is excellent. Lots of hot salty cheese and garlic on a thin crispy base. We had the vegetarian supreme which was very good. The salads were very average. A bag of salad with some dressing on the side. The kids pizzas were ok. Overall a little better than average, quite pricey $25 for a pizza, but in a nice outdoors setting. Holland Village is lovely on a warm balmy evening and sitting outdoors in the hustle and bustle is fun. Get there by 730pm to get a table, otherwise it gets very busy, including Crus

The pizzas are different - yes, they are rectangular (and small for the price!) The toppings are interesting - yes, but nothing as innovative as CPK. The food is decent - yes, but beware of superlative reviews ("the best", "amazing", etc.), and beware of any food chain that calls itself "gourmet". What's gourmet about this food? And what's Moroccan about the lamb? No spices that resemble a mechoui or a lamb tagine! The best pizza in Singapore is definitely not this one. Maybe Mozza at MBS; even CPK is better

Been recommended to this place by friends who stays at Holland Village. First impression of the menu was that we were fascinated by the very creative pizza toppings. There were the usual sausages, ham, cheese selections, but after seeing the menu we were feeling adventurous and decided on the Moroccan lamb and the indulgent wagyu prawn pizza. The lamb was nicely done and well seasoned. The yogurt really really well , providing a refreshing texture and taste to the richness of the lamb. The waygu pizza was delightful . The beef was cooked perfectly, still retaining the wagyu's texture, tenderness and flavour. Our beer went so well with these fabulous pizzas. The service was good with a good friendly team of staff. Lovely restaurant to visit with a lively atmosphere. Shall come again one of these days over the weekend when Holland Village is most vibrant

Just back in china and already missing the Moroccan lamb pizza which is simply ammazing. Apparently, they slow roast the lamb they use! It's freshly roasted so it really taste good! Yummy! Plus the pure blond draft beer, perfecto! :-)

holland village location is super fun. and great place to people watch and drink overpriced beer (10-12$ per bottle) and pizza 23$ for a small veggie pie. it was pretty good, if you treat it as an appetizer.

I brought a frd along as she is glutton intolerant and I told her Crust has one of the best glutton free pizza. She said she has not had pizza for years and when she ate the gourmet cheese glutton free pizza- it was simply awesome. I tried the new wagyu prawn pizza and again it's great. And we finish it off with a great apple crumble dessert pizza (I think that's what it's called) with ice cream and it's simply a dessert pizza to die for. Goodness! Plus the excellent service from their manager, Shannon, you couldn't have a better combination. No wonder I had to wait for seats on a Friday nite! Way to go!

The square type pizzas are unique and tasty. Coupled with bottles of beers shared amongst friends made our evening wonderful. There are many type to choose from. I recommend you mix and match to find your favorite. The typical ham and pineapple pizza is classic, and the exotic Mediterranean lamb is delicious if you can withstand the taste. Salmons pizza is very nice. Also, try the 'Char Siew' chicken wing as side dish. EXCELLENT

Firstly apologies for the title in capitals, it was just that good!Me & my partner have spent the last 6 months living in Macau, and being coeliac (unable to eat wheat etc) we have been unable to enjoy pizza.Upon our visit to singapore we did some searching around and discovered that crust sold gluten free pizza! When we arrived, the holland village area itself is fantastic and being able to see the chefs prepare the pizzas was fantastic.We went for a meat pizza that hall all sorts of diffent meats on it, and also had a cajun chicken. Both were fantastic and as gluten free pizza bases go, this was the real deal, doughy and stretchy, not dry and flakey as is often the case.Im not sure if it was an error on the restaurants part or gluten free actually is cheaper, but either way the pizzas should have cost $25/22 SGD however both were charged at $18 SGD which was a lovely suprise when we got the bill!Lovely place, great pizzas and staff were good too! 5 stars :

We just returned from dinner at Crust, and the pizza was very good. The toppings were quite different than the usual, and we had a half and half prosciuto white pizza and sausage duo. The crust is nice and crispy, and the toppings are very high quality. All in all, it was delicious.Service was also top notch, with our waiter being very attentive. Dinner for 2 with a beer was about 55SGD, which is decent for Singapore.The ambiance of the place is also very nice, and you can see the people walking by.Definitely recommended

I visited the crust gourmet pizza bar on thomson road just by the road side. Its a small no frills pizza bar and slightly expensive than other pizza outlets like dominos and canadian pizza. But what choices of toppings they have! Once you are bored of having the same kind of pizza and you want something out of the box, this is the place to be. The pizzas here are rectangular in shape and 2 pizzas regular size serve 2. Service is quick and taste is superb. Pizzas starting $S25. You can have other sides as well with a twist. I believe they have veg options too

This is the worst food experience we have had in Singapore. We ordered a fried duck salad, chicken wings and a parma, mozzerella, gorgonzola and fried potato pizza, and NONE of the dishes were good. The "duck" salad, had smoked ham in it, and as we addressed it to the waiter, he told us we were wrong - it was duck. The chicken wings were HORRIBLE, completely covered in nasty sauce, and no meat at all on themAnd the Gourmet pizza.......if you took the underboiled potatos off (which should have been nicely roasted) you could eat it - but it was such a disappointment.All in all - never go to Crust - it's a waste of A LOT of money
5
We visited this restaurant thru a recommedation, but it was one of our greatest finds in Singapore. The pizzas are awesome and there is enough variety to suite every taste. Lamb, Chicken, Duck, MEat, vegetarian... wow!Pizza looks amazing and smells awesome when served to our table! Pipping hot and we were straving. This place has some of the good collection of Aussie beers in Singapore. The manager is a fantastic host and has a good knowledge of everything they serve from the food to the drinks. The staff is also very friendly.We visited this place twice and more to come

Went by to Holland village which is a must visit in sinagpore.We went by this restaurant which touted "no1 gourmet pizza in Australia". That caught our interest. So we sat down for some pizza and beer. We first settle on "pure blonde" a low carbo beer. :-) then came the pizzas, pipping hot and amazingly tasting.We tried the morrocan lamb and i must say its one of the best lamb pizzas i have eaten ever. (I have eaten a lot of pizzas world wide)... We then found out that this is an award winning pizza in an international pizza competition world wide.Then we had a mushroom pizza to offset the guilt of a lamb pizza. And we were pleasantly surprise how generous the serving of wild mushroom and the whiff of truffle oil makes all the senses perk up for another amazing pizza treat. Again it must be the best mushroom pizza i had.After putting up such a strong review, many must be wondering if i am related to the restaurant. Unfortunately not but if i could i will, then i would have great tasting pizzas alway! Am returning home in 3 days time and i think i shall be back for my last meal in Singapore! Sngapore is an amazing city and finding such a great local pizza joint is indeed a great find. I am so gonna miss this pizza place
