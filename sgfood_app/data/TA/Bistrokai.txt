Food is great!!!! They have set lunches that are very worth it! Lady boss is chatty and friendly. Not many tables so do make a reservation if going.

First the bad; food was average, salmon was slightly dry while lamb chops were mostly pure fat. Tasty though! The service and ambiance exceeded expectations, hence the 4 stars!

Brought my parents there due to the entertainer app- food was good n interesting; ordered the surf n turf n sea bass... would stick more to the steak offerings

The food was nice but the portion was small. The environment setup for Valentine's day was not good enough. More related decorations should be put up.

Good service. Scallops were nicely done. Special mention for the Lava cake.. Great PR.. makes u feel at home.

Service staff was helpful and informed customers of promotions going on. Many food choices for the set lunch menu. Ordered the beef but could not taste any beef taste. My companion raved about the indonesian style pork ribs though.

We ordered two mains - the steak was average while the indonesian ribs were quite good. It added up to 30 sgd with the entertainer which is very value for money!

Entertainer app was a bonus. Main courses pricing reasonable. The broccoli with onsen egg is very good!

Went at a time where their dinner menu was undergoing changes due to a lack of head chef, and hence only a few items were available. Service was the only good highlight of our dinner, as the fish was overcooked and the steak too rare for a medium rare.

Was introduced to Bistrokai via the Entertainer app, it's a really quiet place situated in the hotel. My friend and I both ordered the steak and we loved it! I enjoyed it at a promotional price but even without, the prices are not exorbitant. Service staff was efficient and friendly too.
