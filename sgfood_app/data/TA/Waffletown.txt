Seems like the taste n portion of food has decreased.........
Nonetheless, you don't have much choices of food here is Balmoral Plaza.

Waffletown standard has dropped after they moved to Balmoral Plaza. Their fried chicken lack the oomph !!

Food is western food style.
They have just increased their price beginning of 2017.
Nonetheless, food is simple fried chicken, pork chop, drinks, waffle, sumba fish etc. My favorite is sumba fish & "super set" (fried chicken nuggets). Price is reasonable

For simple cheap food that is not riddled with MSG. The chicken chop is the Favourite of many. Selection of deserts too
Eat in or or take away.

This is a fun dive that offers plenty of choices of comfort food. Of course the waffles are a must, but a nice gem of a menu item are the fried mozzarella sticks. The service is nice and you will feel valued as a customer. Easy to get to from Newton MRT.

~Waffletown first started out in the basement of Bukit Timah Plaza in the early 1980s back when ice cream served on waffles ala mode was a novelty and Happy Kappy was still the champion local creamery just opposite them...~but this is not the same one they reinvented a local menu that has seen local ACS boys and a host of other kids from premier schools nearby flocking thru their doors with a steady stream of after hours and weekend families stopping by for their weekly fix of tasties~the almost bald old man clearing tables, the other middle aged bald man with a smiling face, his wife behind the kitchen with a scowl and OMG their 2 kids, the son has grown so tall towering over his dad at the counter I remember both of them always sitting at the right corner table doing their homework everytime I visited~from when I first set foot at the Balmoral outlet, I'd always ordered a sambal fish with buttered rice and French fries with a chicken burger to go. In later years I'd ordered the spaghetti bolo and remember they used to punch holes in the foam package to let the hot air out...I've been a fan for decades and even today my kids have a favorite food they love here, my third child drops in weekly for the last 7 years and they know his order without having to askI absolutely love the family atmosphere that Waffletown brings out in both sides and if you ever drop in for the first time, you'll get to see just why so many people keep coming back again :

I ordered the 'combo burger' meal which consists of a burger with a beef patty, egg, cheese and veggie, with a drink and fries. For the price, the portion size is reasonable. However, it tastes more like street food, something you would get at a festival or night market, rather than a fast food joint. The burger really reminds me of a ramly burger, but less oily. The beef patty didn't taste like beef at all, but the meal was still yummy.For dessert, we ordered a raspberry and chocolate ice cream on separate waffles to share. The ice cream didn't have the 'cheap' taste (like some of those you would find at convenience stores) but the waffles were not worth buying. It wasn't as fluffy as we would like.Overall, I feel that if this place was a bit cheaper, I would go back again. However, it would not be worth making a trip down just to eat

I have been eating at Waffletown since my first child and now my fourth kid is six, been eating here for 16 years and nothing has changed! Great food and great service anytime! Strongly recommend their fried chicken, chicken chop and of course, their waffles and ice cream anytime.

We bought 2 pcs chicken meal and a "fish and chips" here. The chicken is crispy outside and moist inside its not salty and not too much seasoning its ok to my tasting but not with my wife though. The chicken meal comes also with mashed potatoes, drink, and coleslaw. Overall for me the chicken was ok. Meanwhile the fish & chips a little bit off to my tasting, the chips was ok with enough seasoning, but the fish batter a bit too salty it's too bad because the fish it self is good, fresh, and moist

Don't be fooled by their interior and furnishing which looks very 80s....This place has nice fried chicken and their plain waffle is very delicious too.Worth mentioning is their grill fish...soft on the inside, lightly crunch on the outside.Do check out their meal + 2.90 ice cream waffle meal on weekdays.
