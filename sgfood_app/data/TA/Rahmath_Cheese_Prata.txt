Freshly made, friendly and efficient service. The mutton curry was light. Overall good. Will try again when I'm in the area.

Note: Rahmath Cheese Prata is closed on Mondays, otherwise it's open daily from 6 am to 1:30 pm.I came to know this place through word of mouth like many others. Simple stall, family owned, but serves one of the best roti pratas in Singapore with great tasting curry gravy. The pratas are tasty by themselves. The lines can be long but definitely worth the wait

On a recent trip to Singapore, I had my favorite Pratha's - A Banana and a Strawberry one. The Banana one has real banana in it and the Strawberry has strawberry paste. Everybody in Singapore always say - "Strawberry - never seen before". It is located near Block 66 in Toa Payoh - they are only S$ 2 - that coupled with a coffee from the stall next to the Pratha's for only 60 cents. Cant beat it for a breakfast. Only open in the mornings. The also sell the normal ones with the "curry" dip. The Pratha's are made in the traditional way. A treat to watch
