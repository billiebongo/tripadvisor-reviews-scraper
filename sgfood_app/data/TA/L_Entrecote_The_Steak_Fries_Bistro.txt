Great ambience and excellent food. Kept simple with the fact that you only order steak and fries. Just pick the appetizers if needed. Desserts were great. Highly recommend the caramel lava cake.

i feel that for the amount paid, the food is value for money. the steak could be more tender but the sides, salad and sauce were good.
1
Didn't expect to pay $50++ for this kind of bad quality steak... it's worse than what we can buy from any supermarket (discounted value)..
5
Food was good and value for money as the fries was free flow. Only complain if any is the space between the tables was very small, no privacy between other tables

Was really disappointed with this place. I booked one week in advance for valentines day via Facebook. The restaurant confirmed with me and i even followed up on the day to reconfirn, When I arrived there was no booking under my name and we were ushered to the end of a 6 seater table layout with them pulling the table at the end out slightly. We asked to be moved. The steak and fries. Probably the worst version of French steak and fries I have ever had. Fries tasted like they had been dripped in fat and someone had clearly gone a bit heavy with the lemon mixed in the sauce that covered the steak.We were given a complimentary drink once we had to asked to move and explained this was supposed to be a valentines day booking (albeit no record of it at the front desk).This restaurant claims to be one of the most romantic in Singapore hence the Valentine day booking. Apart from the decor and Duxton Hill settings, not sure how they can claim this magical status

Went to this place on Valentines night with my partner. We ordered the standard steak dish, medium rare, with fries. It did not disappoint! At only $35, this was easily the best steak and fries I’ve ever had. Melt in the mouth meat, crispy fries, and more food than I could finish.Really lovely atmosphere too, we sat outside and enjoyed the buzzing courtyard and music from next door.I highly recommend this place
5
when i walkin down in duxton hill area i saw this resto and i decide to try they serve meat 150gr and 300gr and for the presentation they slice the meat into pieces and serve it with mustard sc and of course free flow fries!! great ambience ,good job

I have been to this restaurant a number of times of the years. It feels like they still have the same ambitions but can’t really handle it. At the beginning of my dinner the service was top notch but as the place filled up I saw less and less of my waiter at the end they didn’t emptied the table before I got the check. Foie gras was ok the meat was ok the French fries was really good.
1
Went for the Christmas dinner menu with a friend and this is my first time there. This restaurant is supposedly special for their steak but it was chewy and bland. The very basic of salt n pepper rub prior to cooking the steak was not even reflected. The gravy was nothing to rave about either.Except for the fries and dessert, the meal was disappointing. Oh we had escargot for entree to share...again if there was no garlic butter cooked with the escargot the taste was bland. Understand you cannot get fresh escargot here but surely can be done better at this restaurant.We asked for tomato sauce for fries and they didn’t have...even the table next to us asked the same. Sometimes it’s not about what you want to serve but what the customer wants!!For the price they charge, I feel there’s better steaks out there.Decor was nice, French bistro feel but that won’t get me back there
3
The food is great and of course who cannot resist those fries!!!! But the wine list is dismal and very over-priced. We couldn't drink the first bottle we order (it wasn't corked, it was just terrible), so we ordered a different bottle. Because it wasn't corked we were not looking for a refund, but I would have expected the staff to inquire why we were not drinking the first bottle and asking them to clear it and the four barely touched glasses.
5
Steak and fries, two of my favourite food paired with an amazing atmosphere and excellent customer service :)
4
Good ambience, food was served quickly, unlimited fries, price was alright around 40+ per pax. Only downside was you won’t be able to bring your own dessert
3
Steaks were not as tasty as we expected them to be. Over rated. Fries were addictive n good though. So was the bone marrow appetiser. The duck Rillete was a disappointment too.
1
My friend was made to squeeze in between tables with absolutely no assistance from the service staff. Horrible experience.
2
Use to enjoy having a steak at the Entrecôte at Duxton every now and then but was bitterly surprised the other evening when we saw our steaks...considerably downsized! Really a pity because the location, ambiance and quality of food is good...
4
L'Entrecote The Steak & Fries Bistro service one of the best steak in town.the fries are one of the best i had.
5
Lucky to find this fantastic restaurant in Duxton Hill open for Saturday lunch when most other restaurants in the same area are closed.
5
We were there for the steak frites, which was rather good. The highlight was the French Onion Soup which our litttle girl loved a lot. Best highlight for the little lady was that they served her a complimentary nice non-alcoholic fruit punch and we had complimentary drinks too. A quiet relaxed ambience for a nice dinner, with excellent service which was not overly fussy.
5
The staff are brilliant, very efficient, very accommodating. The steak, sauce and fries are so delicious, that you continue to eat even if you are full from having a scrumptious starter. People wait for ages for a table without a booking, showing just how yummy the food is, but best to book in advance
4
I have always loved the entrecôte style of cuisine, and I haven’t been disappointed of the quality of the food. Although the prices are way too high for this type of cuisine. It is a shame because I’m sure that the restaurant could attract more customers by lowering their prices..
4
Very nice people, great steak and fries, good chocolate mousse.
This is a place that doesn't disappoint.
4
Great ambiance, not over the top for casual dining. The steak wasn't exactly medium rare as requested (all of ours tasted medium well), but the sauce and fries were really good. Great service and we loved the rosé we had as a welcome drink!
3
L'Entrecote is a restaurant with many starter and dessert options but just 1 main dish - the signature steak and fries. So non-beef eaters take heed! For steak eaters, you have the option of the regular (~190g) or XXL cut (~300g). Steaks were disappointing though. The issue wasn't with the doneness of the steak, but rather the questionable quality of beef being used. The fries were good though.Given the variety of steakhouses around, would probably not return
4
If a restaurant is going to only do one main course, it needs to do it well. I have tried similar establishments in other cities and after many times thinking about trying here we finally got around to it.We rocked up fairly early, sans reservation but got a table easily, however, had we been later it might have been different.No need for starters, straight to the chase. The only decision to make is how you want the steak cooked. I was surprised to see "well done" as an option - I went to a place in HK recently who stated they would only serve their steak rare or medium rare(!) - but we requested a point, and saignant (medium and medium rare) so that was fine. There was a fair wine list, but a bottle their own label Bordeaux looked the right choice and it was pretty decent.We toyed with our green salads with walnuts, they were OK, but salad is, well, rabbit food at the best of times.The steaks arrived after a suitable interval, plated up by the wait staff in the dining room and smothered in the Cafe de Paris sauce. And a few frites. Well, to be honest, a shed-load of frites. Verging on "American" serving. I would have preferred fewer and when we go back, as is highly likely, I will make the point of asking for less.Both were cooked well, and how I would have expected them outside France: in France medium rare is always closer to rare than say here.After making some inroads into the food, the waitress brought the rest of the steak and offered more frites: had I not eaten for a week I might have taken her up on it as they were good frites but having only the one stomach I passed.My only minor criticism was a slight lack of seasoning, but that is always to be expected in Singapore, the salt police have declared salt is A Bad Thing so I needed a touch more on mine.There was a dessert selection and having had the house main course, and the house red, we went for the house dessert to share, a salted caramel lava cake, a la mode. There was a warning that there would be 15 minute wait for said confection but that gave us time to reflect on the meal and begin digesting it.Dessert was quite reasonable and a good way to finish.Cost was pretty fair as well, $190 all in so as I say, somewhere to add to our rotation
4
French to the core. Only one dish, steak frites. Both came out perfectly cooked as ordered. I would've preferred to forego the sauce on top, but my wife loved the sauce. Horses for courses. Massive amount of crispy frites. Feed two armies on them. Not cheap, would not want to spend that much every night
4
What was excellent is just how people can combine great quality with little choice. Good steak with excellent sauce. And no nonsense about wine. Not something like what kind of wine so you want? No Bordeaux otherwise go somewhere else. Had a very enjoyable evening with a reasonable bill.
4
Not sure why this place gets low ratings. You can see that it serves steak and chips with a lovely sauce and lots of lovely wines sitting outside in cool Duxton Hill.Service was pretty good, nice place to chill and relax and do some business
4
Ordered the onion soup, and for mains I had the classic steak and fries, which comes with a nice side salad so you get your greens too! Clue is in the name, for the mains your only selection is pretty much only steak and fries! You do get to choose between a regular or XL portion though. Go big or go home, full of yummy steak in ya belly...
3
The atmosphere of the Duxton outlet was great, had pretty high expectations after having a fantastic meal at their Suntec branch (now closed) a few years ago.They wouldn't seat us until everyone arrived but did make allowances when we mentioned that it was a birthday surprise and we would like to be seated before the birthday girl made her grand appearance. Ordering and the delivery of food was fast. We were told while placing our orders that those who were sharing the XXL steak meal weren't allowed to have free flow fries, something that we understood and were absolutely okay with. What we were not expecting was that those who shared meals were not allowed to request for extra sauce for the steak, this was pretty ridiculous to us as we felt that we should at least be able to request for 1 extra serving of sauce per set meal - further more the steak was bland. Did not expect this kind of skimpy service from a restaurant that I presumed was more upmarket.Overall had an average night at L'EntrecÃ´te
5
This place is best for fries and steak. If you love your steak and fries, this is the place to go. They are very generous with the steak. You can always ask for top up for your fries whenever you are done. Good place for hangout with friends. Recommended to make reservations before heading down.
4
餐廳位於Duxton Street，很清幽，餐廳的裝潢就跟法國的小酒館一樣，不過晚上真的蠻嘈吵的。一坐下就有complimentary welcome drink。牛扒和薯條套餐有沙律和麵包，每人只是S$40左右，很划算。
3
Ordered medium well steak but it came well done - too charred and tough. Complimentary drink was good.
4
Steaks are well prepared. Went for the XXL size and it's rewarding. Cooked just the way I wanted it. Fries I suspect were from the freezer, but still ok.
3
Food is quite good, do not expect the best at this price. Staff (filipinos) are warm, nice and efficient.
5
charming little establishment with friendly wait staff, the main draw here is the affordable steak that's for a pretty good standard, paired with free flow of fries and a starter salad. will definitely come back here again
3
Guess the interesting thing about this place is that as the shop name denotes, you will have a Steak (done from rare to well done) and lots of fries as your main dish so no need to crack your brain trying to figure out what to order. They do have dessert and such. Service is fast and friendly
3
This is the second time here, first time was a few years ago, however the quality and taste was a lot worser than the previous time. The sauce was more mustardy than the last memory there which didn't taste as nice. But the worst thing was that the steak was overcooked. Very light pink and no blood at all for a medium rare steak. And not to mention the really cramped seating :( This will be my last time visiting this place...
2
The taste of the steak was so so although it was nicely cooked according to our request. I am really disappointed with the super cramp space. The restaurant was actually empty but we were forced to sit at a table for two without no space to exit. The waiter refused to put us to a bigger table. When I asked why can't you push these tables so that we can have more space to get in and out our seat, the answer was simply "this is our concept". Then I replied...Oh it is your concept to torture your guest until we can't get out from our seat. If the restaurant was full, I would understand such refusal. However, it was very empty
4
Had a pleasant experience dining at L'Entrecote. Ordered 3 appetizers (french onion soup, foie gras pâté and escargots) and the XXL portion of steak frites to be shared among us two. The soup was great, foie gras pâté was huge but delectable and the escargots were normal. The steak was tender but we were not fans of their special sauce which was a tad sour for our liking. Ambience and service were great though
5
We frequent this restaurant often and the service and food is always good. The french onion soup is delicious. We normally get the steal frites and if not too full, we get a caramel lava cake. Be careful not to order too many appetizers or you will be too full for dessert. The house red is also very good. Highly recommended making a reservation if you plan to go as it gets quite busy.
5
The steak was cooked quite well and the fries were addictive. The sauce, as advertised, was legendary and went well with both steak and fries. Desserts were good too.
4
Great experience in Duxton, simple menu, great service and a good wine list. If you are looking for steak and fries this is the place, no frills no fuss and an easy decision making process. enjoy the food and sit outside on the street. Enjoy.
5
My husband and I are regulars here, but we brought our two boys for the first time for Father's Day brunch. The food was excellent and a good size for two growing boys and the service was amazing as always :)
5
The service was splendid, food was exceptional, both the steak and fries. Everything was just great.
3
Food is average and passes the average standard, but below our expectations given its price. Better steak places out there.
5
Whatever L'Entrecote puts into their steak sauce it makes a to-die-for sauce! Simply the best steak & frites & secret sauce in Singapore. Topped off with a fabulous caramel sauce pudding in the style of a fondant au chocolat. Such a treat.
5
Very neat restaurant, fancy layout but simple yet delicious steak and fries just like their shop name. Love it.
2
Was searching for a good steak house to celebrate Fathers day n since Lawrys only had available seating from 8 pm, i settled for this place after reading all the reviews.First of all for those driving, you must be prepared to wait as spaces are very limited.The place was small and cosy but aircon was very weak. Everyone around me was fanning themselves. Portion wise it was huge and they even came around with extras. But sadly none of us really enjoyed the steak. Maybe the meat was not of high grade so it was basically tasteless. Of course the sauce will cover it all but it was not enjoyable. Anyway wont be coming back any time soon
4
First time i had lunch in an outside place in Singapore but they have a very good ac-system. My food was really good but I missed a little salad with the burger. Other than that, reasonably priced, very friendly and swift service. Excellent for a quick lunch
3
Space was abit too small. Tables were abit too close for comfort - would be great if they could distant them slightly. Nonetheless the steak definitely did not disappoint and we had a great evening. Not to mention, the staff were polite and sensitive to our requests.
5
Have been here for business lunches on many occassions - the service is always very good and the food - although simple - is always great!
2
Lovely area and attractive restaurant, steak quite good, sauce nothing like the original concept, fries dreadful, being presented with the bill without having to ask is great except when you haven't even been offered a look at the dessert menu.
3
We have been to this restaurant many times, the steak was very disappointing this time we actually left most of it - such a shame as it was a birthday celebration meal
4
Everything was wonderful except for the sittings. The tables were too packed closely to each other, didn't have enough privacy for talking.
4
Food is not bad at all. Some starters are good (foie gras terrine) and more interesting than main courses. The place can be very noisy at times.
4
Food is good. Service is good. Just that the place is very cramp. Overall not bad. Will visit again if there's a chance. :)
3
Not crowded when we go In the afternoon. Service so so not the typical Italian or French restaurant service. If there's lunch set would be good.
4
Loved the steak with the sauce. Sauce truly made the dish. Fries were nice and crisp. The salty caramel cake was the perfect way to end the meal.
5
There are no words that can explain the experience you receive in this bistro. The food is amazing and the service was perfect. I highly recommend this place!
5
I do not need to say much about this place as many people will have visited at one of their locations and know their secret sauce. This is a franchise and I had previously visited in Canary Wharf. It was perfect for our first night in Singapore, good food with ample portion size. No one else in my party had been to L'Entrecote previously and they were impressed and will return to a home location. The setting is really romantic and the service was fabulous.
5
Our go-to-place to get our Steak-fix. Always good quality and very yummy!!! Good value for money :))
3
The sauce not as smooth, the beef was also not as good. However overall still nice. Love the fries. The seating is very close in between chairs. Not a good place to have conversations.
4
We went there early thus the service very attentive. Nice touch that they gave complimentary rosè wine. Ordered the steak with fries. Their steak sauce was a touch acidic (sour), too sour for my liking. The French fries was cooked well, well seasoned and crispy.
4
Good ambiance, great food, nice service.
We enjoyed a drink before the meal, then we had the usual entrecote with fries, which was just right, then we finished with dessers which were real good.
5
This was our second visit. As we both adore the vast arrangement of the desserts, we opted to share a main, and share 3 desserts ! The steak was beautiful, perfectly cooked to our requirements. We were advised that as we were sharing a main, that "free flow" of fries would not be available, but we could not finish the huge amount that was served to us! The desserts are stunning, great choice and a good size. A joy to return.
4
Had a high expectation on the Wagyu ribeye but it wasn't as good as expected, which wasn't value for the money. I requested for a small surprise for my Boyfriend's birthday and the staff assisted me for it. Service was excellent! And for those who love fries, they do top up fries for free
5
This restaurant only has one main dish, steak and delicious unlimited, all-you-can-eat French fries, but they have several appetizers and desserts. I try to eat mainly vegetarian, so just had bread, cheese and salad and then French onion soup as my main even though it has beef broth. The only other two vegetarian options are endive salad (with blue cheese and walnut) and the classic Parisien leek & vinaigrette, which I have not had, so cannot comment. They are very child friendly and in a lovely location. Definitely recommended.
4
L'Entrecote have some of the best steak and chips in Singapore, and the prices are good. The formula is adjusted slightly from the original restaurants in Paris and London - they offer starters in Singapore, and the seating is less "intimate". However, it still works - the restaurant is a favourite for me.The wine however is awful. Super ordinary (and super cheap) French and Aussie wine is priced up to $100+ a bottle and it spoils the experience somewhat. It's strange as the L'Entrecote Wine Bar next door (which also sells steaks, and presumably shares the kitchen) has a good wine list. A new sommelier or wine buyer is urgently needed
4
We came here for an early dinner on a Sunday with our 3 kids - 2 are steak eaters, 1 is a vegetarian. It didn't occur to me to check the menu in advance but there are VERY limited options for vegetarians - basically onion soup, salad and fries.The meat eaters in our group enjoyed the steak, though it was a bit chewy and didn't seem to be a great cut of meat. However we enjoyed the ambiance, fries, and house wine. Welcome drinks were a nice touch. Service was great (though there were only 2 other diners at the time we were there).I'd come here again with friends instead of kids and soak up the ambiance. :
4
If you enjoy steak and fries but hate paying absurd prices... this is a great place to visit! The steak is more minute steak with a very nice sauce, fries are all you can eat and you feel like in a tiny French restaurant... Definitely a new addition to our regular places!
2
Food is not good. French fries at Mc Donald are better. Steak is OK. The pepper sauce is something... I don't know.
Being Belgian, you would expect in a restaurant pretending to be French some French food. Disappointing!
Environment is fantastic. Waitress was very kind!
3
Had their famous steak and fries, only their sauce was amazing. Steak was so-so, too chewy and not tender enough. Fries overly fried, if not for their steak sauce, everything was boring. Won't be coming back again.
4
The steak was not as good as expected as it was pretty dry. But overall the service and environment is nice. Their sparkling water is surprisingly not free, so be cautious when the waitress asks you whether you want water or sparkling water.
3
Had very high expectations of the steak with their in-house sauce but had to say my partner and I did not enjoy the food. But, they had excellent service!
5
I booked the restaurant last minute but they were very accommodating. French onion soup and steak was very good
4
I've read everywhere online that this place is amazing for steak and fries - I mean how can they not be, if that's the only thing on their mains menu? I also read that they have unlimited fries, and not only did they deliver on that, they also gave everyone extra steak! Not sure if it was just the weekend that I went (which was the weekend right before Valentine's Day), but no complaints here!The restaurant itself is extremely crowded and you're barely 20cm away from the next table because they cram a table into every single area available, but their turnover is super fast and they're very efficient. The ambience and food is so good that after a while you forget the crowdedness anyway.Overall, great food, great service and I would totally come back again
5
Classic steak frites place - a complimentary glass of kir to start. They do have a menu but most people go for the salad with walnut to start followed by the steak frites - enough steak for 2 portions and as many fries as you can eat. Wash it all down with a bottle (or 2) of the house red
4
This is a small place, but if you want a great steak and chips then look no further. The meal was delicious, cooked to perfection and I could easily go back for more. My friend and I did not experience any of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned - we were served well, and ate at our leisure. The whole Duxton Hill area was really nice too. It has a really relaxed atmosphere with a huge variety of restaurants and bars with flavours and options from all over the world. Would like to explore more
4
I'm a big fan of the Paris chain Le Relais de L'Entrecote, which offers a simple menu of salad, steak and frites along with a mustard based sauce. Well, Singapore's L'Entrecote absolutely nails it! It's not as good as it's Paris counterpart, but pretty darn close. I wasn't disappointed, and would go back anytime. They have a decent wine list, as well.
2
The idea for this restaurant is a good one, but it is poorly executed. I agree with other reviewers about the patrons being packed in too close together. My main beef though (pardon the pun) is with the service. We were barely inside the door 15 minutes when our mains were served. This is really not on in a restaurant that is less than half full. Wine prices were steep relative to the modest quality of the food. The short point is this: the Duxton Road/Hill precinct is packed with better value options - you don't need to chance your arm here
3
tables were quite close but service were relatively good.
food was just average, steak and fries were served cold
3
Seat was packed too closely apart from each other, no personal space provided to diners. We ordered the beef marrow and two portions of steak; do not get the beef marrow, it was a waste of money($24?!)
4
The quality of the food and service is pretty good. The only thing lacking is the space between tables. Very narrow even for petite size.
4
Love the service by the.. manager? Really attentive and nice. Beef steak was great as always! Love it
2
Steak is no good (probably a raw material issue) but sauce is tasty. Appetizer n dessert are yummy though. House red wine taste too plain. Since the main course is key overall dining experience is below average.
5
Had a very good experience there, just that I didn't know they charge for the water. But for the price, it's totally worth it.
4
Good food and ambience, steak was good and the fries was so yummy, my profiteroles dessert was so so good. price was not too bad, will definitely come back
5
Its a good place to go to if you want a quiet evening with your other half. It comes with a complimentary drink when you first enter.

Given a previous good experience at L’Entrecote, I decided to visit this place again for a Christmas dinner with my friends. However, both the food and service were highly disappointing. I will not be returning to this restaurant again. Food: Fries were good, beef was okay. It was definitely a lot better during my previous visit. Service: Unacceptable and poor service. The entire meal was so rushed it was like we weren’t welcome. - Over an hour, 2 servers asked me 5 – 6 times on whether I was done with my salad (though my plate was not empty & I was still eating)- Bread basket was not empty, server asked if they could take it back as they ran out of baskets (restaurant was not full, and we were obviously not done)- Asked to clear plates though there were still fries on them and we were still eatingWe made excuses for them and even thought through the different scenarios in which this could possibly be acceptable but nothing can hold. - Attentive service: They could be said to be really attentive. I was even appreciative the first few times they had asked. But multiple times when we are obviously not done – that’s not providing attentive service- Meal time limit: Understand this happens at some restaurants. But if so, this should’ve been mentioned during reservation or at the beginning of the meal. Nothing was said- Full restaurant with a queue outside: Restaurant had empty tables, no queue outside- Making space for other dishes: The table had more than sufficient space or nothing else was coming - Taking too long for our meal: We were there from 7pm to 8.15pm. I would think it’s normal to take 1 – 3 hours for a meal at a nice restaurant? We were there for slightly over an hour – more than within acceptable limits if there are any Overall, this was very disappointing. The food and service level has declined significantly and I will not be back again. For a similar price range, you can definitely get better food and service elsewhere
4
We have tried other steak restaurants in Singapore but keep coming back to L'Entrecote at Duxton Hill. The steak is always trimmed of fat, cooked exactly as requested, the sauce always tasty and the portions a good size. The service is always at a high standard. Fridays and Saturdays are always busier with the nearby bars open, but it is very quiet and easy to get a table on Sunday nights
3
The portion of the fries wasn't distribute well. Presentation was very bad. The whole chunk of fries over the steak. We wasn't told that there 2nd serving of steak. But the salad was very nicely done.
5
This was simply amazing. Such a cool vibe, loved the food and had the best time with my boyfried here! Highly recommended. It's seriously a MUST in Singapore. Affordable and super tasty!
2
Six of us went for dinner at their branch in Suntec. The medium raw steak is so tough it was a struggle to chew. Not worth the price. Also the fries were skinny.
2
Went there on a Friday night with friends. It started raining and although it had a covered tent, the rain was hitting the table. We asked to move to the same-name bistro bar next door that was empty, but they insisted on staying at our table and that the rain would not last long. The food took a very very long time to arrive and it was OK, but nothing to write home about. for the price, I will not go back
4
Went today for lunch and really enjoyed it. Getting a second helping of steak and fries was a big bonus. The sauce was also great. I would ask for a better choice of wine by the glass for the lunch crowd tho. As a bottle at lunch is not the best idea for a productive afternoon. I could imagine it would get pretty cramped when busy as the tables are so close together that you have to move them to get to the bench seats. And even then anyone to large may be knocking over glasses!Would defo go back, as $35 for good steak frites is pretty reasonable
1
Last night, we have made the unfortunate mistake of visiting L'entrecote. This is a place we have been couple of times and generally left satisfied since the menu is very standard and the quality of the steaks were good. Armed with our appetite for steak and fries, four of us decided to visit the place as a walk in customers. (Two other friends were on the way to join us for Cigars and coffee) The location doesn’t accept reservations and it was a Monday night so I was fairly sure the finding a table wouldn’t be a problem. When we arrived only three table were dining and place was at 10% capacity at best. We were to first to arrive and we told the host that we like to sit down and order some wine while we are waiting for our friends. We have been promptly told that we need to sit outside and wait until our full party arrives and until such time we won’t be permitted to sit down. Now, normally on a busy night, this would have been a reasonable request but on a night such as last one I considered this request to be unreasonable. After a brief argument with the host, we asked to see manager. She arrived promptly and repeated the “company policy”. Once we express our disappointment with the lack of initiative and flexibility on management site, manager simply said “I am just working here”. Well there can be a lot said about her response but suffice it to say, the owner didn’t do a good job neither empowering nor training his stuff. Just as we were deciding whether we should sit or leave and dine somewhere else the other couple arrived. At that moment the host, with a smirk on his face, told us “Now you can sit”. This was the tipping point. At that moment, I felt obligated to mention to the manager that this gentleman has no business working in service industry with such attitude and we left the place promptly and went to another restaurant. I think lack of initiative on management side, borderline rude host makes the food irrelevant and I won’t dare to expose myself and my friends to such an ordeal, so never again
5
Chose for a birthday celebration, knowing the entire family enjoys steak.Chose French Onion Soup to begin, which was delicious. Medium-rare steak very good, but more like a rare steak in Australia. The boys devoured. Great, morish French fries and for once, I didn't have to finish everyone else's. They ate them all.Desserts were all good, but not the standard of the steak frites.Quite pricey, but beef is expensive in Singapore.Good service. Will return
4
The location of this restaurant is so relaxing which memories of old Singapore. The menu is pretty simple with steak et frites front and centre. And why not, for a once in while unhealthy meal with unlimited chips? House wines are good and the wine list boasts a few gems. Staff were friendly and attentive. Don't call to book a table - they don't answer their phone?! THe lemon sorbet with limoncello was a nice way to finish the meal
4
I found a listing for E'ntrecote at Duxton Hill in the Singapore Good Food Guide, and decided to try it out. Quite a few bars and restaurants in the pedestrianised part of Duxton Hill. I live in Singapore but I wasn't aware of these fine restaurants until the other evening.Arrived by taxi and walked up the pedestrianised section until I reached the restaurant. Midweek and very few diners so got a table easily. Nice albeit narrow - we were seated near to the air conditioning. Ordered snails for starters - fantastic - full of garlic and most flavoursome. For the main event I ordered steak - it was medium well cooked, and came with French Fries - just as I ordered. Whilst I have nothing but praise for the food I was served, my colleague was less impressed with her order of mussels. The mussels were incredibly small - they were European and not the New Zealand version which are often served in restaurants. Had I ordered them I would have been unhappy too, so keep away from the mussels. For dessert I ordered cream caramel - again that was a wonderful choice.I called in advance to reserve a table and was told that it was not possible, however it is possible to reserve via the Trip Advisor app - which worked well. Free wifi, good service and nice ambiance. Certainly an enjoyably meal.Turn left outside the restaurant and walk down the hill through the car park and you will find a ready supply of taxis.

Seriously this place has one of the best steak frites I have eaten, authentic and rustic. The wag you was great and the sauce was just right. It Coates well, my friends and I had the caramel lava cake after a heavy meal and thought so that it's the best in Singapore for a fondant or some call it a couldn't in one of those Michelin Starred Restaurant. We have enjoyed the food and great service.
1
The food was very poor, low quantity and bad quality! People nice but in the end you need to eat properly right?
5
It is definitely worth trying here if you're a fan of French wines. Tried their specialty steak with free-flow fries and it was amazing. Only issue is they don't accept reservations which is a bummer for organized people. Would definitely come back again.
4
By taking one dish and making it extraordinary L'entrecote excel in what they do. No pretence in trying to go beyond their specialty make their food divine.
5
must order the famous streak, MEDIUM~ melts in your mouth~ reservation helps to reduce waiting time, good for couples and small groups!!
4
The best steak in a long while, been here for the third time. Menu is straightforward and easy to understand, standard is consistent - always great service, memorable place. Lunch and dinner has the same quality service
3
We had entrecote, the only main dish on offer, which is all you need, if you have a craving for steak frites. Unfortunately, it didn't measure up - at least not to our taste. The ambience is great, the staff is nice and attentive and the wine list was good. Perhaps worth a try for those reasons, but there are better places to found. PS for those who like chocolate, their mousse is really, really good
3
ive had the mussels and ive had the steak here, having been to its counterpart in paris i was expecting something on the same level but was a little disappointed. The mussels were very nice and came with bottomless french fries, however the steak was a let down, it was tough and rather tasteless despite the sauce.The service on the other hand was very good and everyone was very friendly.I'd go back for the mussels but not the steak. I've rated it average but only because there wasn't a "good" but i wouldn't go so far as to say "very good". It was also kinda of expensive, for that kind of money i was expecting a better meal
4
We were in singapore during my gf's birthday. so I was picking something that aren't too expensive but wasn't too bad. The steak was recommended on a random blog I came across and the photo looked really good. It was a steak with fries. The steak was amazing!! Although it didn't look too good in picture, but it was absolutely wonderful. Too bad we only ordered one because we wanted to try other food. So we ordered the mussles too, but it wasn't that good. We also had escargot but they forgot about it so our appetizer turned into our dessert. It was hard to find because we didn't know our ways, and it was located in a mall next to some superstore. Good to try, but probably not going to go again
2
WellWhen the wine list is so limited and there is one aka 1 beer to select from there is trouble brewing especially when it's Stella !Food and service so so and the so called "doneness" varies it's always a challengeIf they sort the wine list and stock a few bottle beers there are possibilities 
4
A nice cosy restaurant with a section next door. Was very busy next door, and as we didn't have a reservation, staff were helpful to give us a small table near the bar.Food was very nice, and the highlight was the pate they had on the platter we had as an appetizer.Nice simple menu, steak and chips, or a fish option. I went for the steak, and did ask the what Entrecote steak was, but was unsure even after I was told. It was a striploin steak, and mine was perfectly cooked to medium. Nice and juicy. Although I do prefer to cut the steak myself, but it was served already cut, Wasn't a big deal as the steak was nice.A slight mix up with the orders of my other friends on the table, but were very accommodating and remade the orders, and even gave us a free round of drinks
2
They just served entrecotte. It's not bad, but the last time i was there the price was higher, so I'm not coming back anymore.
3
Tasty lunch - very tight seating. Steak was tough though. IF you wish a great steak meal - try another place before L'entrecote.
5
They offer a lunch special for $20.95++ which is a starter, main course and a soft drink. I had the walnut salad and the steak and it was delicious.
I would certainly go back again.
3
Went to the restaurant with 3 other friends.Chose to have their Wagyu steak which is supposedly their highlight. The steak was just OK. The meat was not as tender as expected and I found my self unable to chew the meat to the end which was not a pleasant experience.I like the price and the history of the place and hence would be willing to give it another go before I finally make up my mind
2
I visited Duxton hill in 2012, was ok... So decided to try out their new opening in Suntec mall. My for end booked on line as you can do for the Suntec Mall one. That was the only decent thing that went well.On arrival, took time to find our table, they only sold Stella beer... No other beer, they had run out of gin ( I don't like Stella, but I'm ok to drink other stuff). Tasted the red wine on house... It was dry and tasted of vinegar, went for the 99$ red ( was meant to be a treat ) ... Turned it just drinkable. My starter of snails was good... My for ends starter of duck roulette was fat with a bit of duck taste ... It should have had more duck taste. The steak was fine but the sauce was over bearing.. Almost drowned it. It just felt a poor experience. Oh - amd if you have a nut allergy, stay away. We asked if one salad could be without walnuts... They brought it with, then took it away, my fore d discovered on eating it all they had done was pick the walnuts off as he found 2 at the bottom of his sale dish. Good thing he just hates walnuts and it's not a life threatening problem. All 3 of us at this restaurant were really disappointed... By food, service, amd ambience. Telling us the reason the food is slow as there is a baby fare upstairs in the mall did not impress us either..... We could not see any connection.
2
This is my second visit as I was not impressed at all on my first. And again, service is slow, inattentive and staff seem disgruntled when handling customers (come on, no smile?) Service in this "bistro-like" establishment, with servers wearing shirt, vest and tie looks awkward with "mahjong" paper as table cloth. Frankly, if you are running it like a bistro, make sure your staff don't look atas, serve atas and talk atas (atas meaning proud) cos you are not fine dining...Waiting time for main course (with a half full restaurant) is 20-30mins. Frankly, I will not be back. No wonder pepperoni next door is always full (and with queue) and Entrecote is always half full. For the price I am paying for the entrees and main course, there are many places around here to dine. Avoid this plac

In spite of the negative comments on service we ate here as we wanted a "beef fix" and it was very convenient to our hotel. Steak was cooked perfectly, sauce excellent and the fries were well-prepared, almost perfectly salted. But the service? Our watiress didn't seem to know what service meant; when our daughter wanted a slight change to the pasta beneath her salmon she didn't know what to do and pushed-back to a a change at first, then commenting that it was odd (daughter wanted pasta tossed in garlic butter rather than a cream sauce). Never refilled empty water glasses, when plates were cleared I counted at least 22 times that she walked passed our table and never asked if we were interested in cofffee, dessert or the check. When I spoke with the hostess she tried to rectify by offereing free dessert (she comped corkage on our wine instead as we wanted to leave) but also seemed well-aware of the issue. The owners need ot address this. There are plantly of similar comnents, and the staff is impeding sales in a busy area where several hotels could feed service if the concierges were in a position to recomment the restaurant. I know I shared my experiece with the Conrad concierge

Went there for a date with my girlfriend, ambience was very nice, very private. Place was very classy. Went to the outlet at Suntec City. We had the l'entrecote steak & fries, Caesar salad & escargots. Steak was cooked to the right doneness for me, but a little too rare for my girlfriend, fries was good and when it was last order we requested for more fries, they served it freshly cooked. Awesome, great service from the staff as well, recommended to visit, but not a fan of the escargots there. They probably should serve some bread first as the steaks took quite awhile. Thank god we had appetizers
4
Went with a group of all-girl friends to the Suntec outlet. The lady manager was very friendly and joked with us. Not packed on a weekday night, so at least it's not so noisy and stressful.Price was very reasonable, with mains at only S$20. Appetizers and desserts were also decently priced. Loved the salty caramel lava cake. And the half baked chocolate cake - not too sweet like most lava cakes.Only disappointment is the Foie Gras, which was a terrain instead of the pan-fried version
2
Visited the outlet in Suntec (near the fountain) for lunch today. Opted for the steak and fries, which came with a salad as a starter. Food was bland and unappealing and the steak wasn't anything particularly special. The restaurant was only about half full at lunch time which perhaps should have been a bit of a sign of the quality to be expected. Total cost for 2 was about $50 which I guess was ok. Overall it could be much better and it's honestly hard to recommend
4
The restaurant has good vibes, waiters are polite and the food is delicious. they have their "special" sauce for the steaks which is really delicious and the size of the dishes is satisfying.
5
located in a vibrant part of china town
packed on weekends, make a reservation.
typical french food, starters like patee or onion soup, main course only entrecote with fries and salad, excellent !!!!
nice deserts, wine etc.....
great experience, reasonable price
1
Food cold bland and not fresh. Not worth the money. Main course came before even 1/2 way through starter. Service way to quick
4
they use good meat and they do it well. prices are reasonable and service is great. will come back again.
3
Nice location on Duxton Hill. This restaurant only serves Steak Frites for the main course and there is a choice of 2 sizes. The steak and chips were average, the salad was excellent as were the starters.
3
I had lunch here with a bunch of people. I found the food mediocre. Had the salmon steak dish. I found the salmon a little tasteless and the sauce lacking. Ambience was okay (went to the Suntec branch) and service was relatively alright. Underwhelming experience, wouldn't return

** This review is for L'Entrecote French Brasserie in Suntec City (Fountain area)**We found this place pretty much by accident as we were looking for a place for lunch after a fair at the Convention Centre.It was pretty busy so we figured it should be good. And it didn't disappoint.We had the lunch set (steak frites) and also a roast chicken main meal. The set was value for money as it came with salad, steak with fries, soft drink and a dessert of the day. Even though we only had a dessert, they were kind enough to let us share- giving us an extra set of cutlery without the need for asking. The prices are affordable and the food tasted good too, especially the fries! Service was quick, even though it was fairly busy - Friday lunch crowd.I would definitely go again
3
Certainly doesn't compare to L'entrecote in other countries, but it's the best Singapore has to offer. Not generous with 2nd servings, and they refused to let me take my leftovers home for my dog because they were scared of liability (food poisoning), even if it was for animal consumption. I even gave consent and accepted the consequences but they still wouldn't let me do a doggy bag. Not a happy customer, but if you're craving L'entrecote- go here
1
Having eaten at entrecÃ´te in Paris and london this place is a complete shambles. Whilst waiting for a steak meal it is customary in France to receive a bread basket. When one dos not appear we questioned this and the response came "it's only given on request " The green salad has an awful citric dressing unlike the beautiful creamy vinaigrette in France and london. Then came the steak with an inadequate sizzle of the famous house sauce. We asked for more and were told we would be charged 3 dollars for it. (Despite a bill of over 100 dollars for two )Then came the profiteroles. A usually delicious and indulgent dessert ... Again this came with a pitiful dribble of choclate sauce on it. Needless to say we did not ask for some more sauce this time ! The whole experience was soulless and petty. We felt we were part of their profit making mathematical sum. No passion. Just a mere business. If it hurst them so much to bring out the food, I suggest they put their mathematical skills in another line of busines
4
Basically, for a really reasonable price, you can get a plate of salad, good quality steak with a pretty nice sauce and unlimited fries. Don't come here if you're looking for variety or a really fine dine experience. But it doesn't hurt to come here when you're craving steak while on a budget
5
One of the popular places in Duxhill area. Menu is straight forward; steaks and fries, but very good!! Not enough? They will come with extra meat, without extra charge :)
2
Cold plates with thinly sliced steak is always a bad start. Tough meat also. Over priced wine. Had the impression that the nice people working there had never tasted their own food. On a positive not the chips were good.
5
I discovered that L'entrecote just recently opened on its side, l'Annexe. And it serves a great Parisian breakfast. I chose the eggs benedict with salmon and it was a best bet. I highly recommend. Freshly backed croissant, tasty coffee, freshly squeesed orange juice. Beautiful pedestrian street, quiet. A perfect start for a sunday with family. Cheers. Vincen

I had heard a lot about this place and on arrival in Singapore some work mates suggested we meet there. It started well with a kir on arrival and some delicious l'escargot but the steak was sinewy and covered in sauce. Way too rich especially when topped by a mountain of fries which, I am a sucker for, but made the whole thing unappetising.
2
I had high hopes for this restaurant as they have one entree of steak and fries I expected it to be excellent..it wasn't. The steak is from a cheap cut and the sauce they serve it with has an overpowering taste of lemon, it was terrible.Only good thing were the fries which unfortunaye they refuse to serve with ketchup which i would have forgiven them for if the steak sauce was at least tasty!I will definitely not be returning
2
It makes me sad to write this review as I was visiting l'entrecote since it opened. However, I realised that the quality got worse over time. My very last experience yesterday was quite special indeed. When I sat down at the table the guys on the table next to us warned us not to order as the food is terrible. Sounded like a very strong word to me so we decided to go ahead. I had bone marrow as a starter (as always), which was within my expectations. However, the salad was served at the same time, which was quite quite special (especially given the fact the the service was exceptional in the beginning). Later on when the entrecote was brought to the table I saw immediately that my rare is not rare but medium well as they meat is already carved. I tried a bite and realised no matter how this meat is cooked it wont be one of my enjoyable. I mentioned to the staff the overdone meat. She offered to get me a new serving, which I rejected due to the fact that it takes another 10 to 20 minutes and my friend already had his food. My disappointment was the fact that I was served carved meat. It's one look and the chef or the staff serving would have realised it's overcooked.Anyway, this was the first time in probably over 20 years (or possible ever) that i did not finish a steak. I felt very sad as I had quite a few good dinners with friends at l'entrecote and I knew the moment I walked out that i will not be back soon
2
I have visited L'Entrecote the first day it opening and a number of times since. The 1st 6 months were great, good service, good food, absolutely no complaints. Then it all started going downhill.I visited sporadically over the last few years to see if they had improved but I am constantly disappointed. The service is bad, the servings are definitely not what they used to be. The food/sauce that made it famous has changed, cold servings .... all in all I will never return.So sad
2
So having been ti the Duxton Hill restaurant and throughly enjoyed it we thought we would try the Suntec City outlet. OMG what a shocker. It was a Friday evening and we had made reservations for 18:30. The restaurant was pretty much empty at that time so we were shown to our table and ordered sparkling water at S$9++ per bottle. OK no worries. We then ordered a bottle of house red which came as a non descript wine that just said L'entrecote 2013 Bordeaux. No other information. We asked the waitress for more information about the wine...needless to say...CLUELESS!Anyway..main course. We ordered the large Steak Frites (S$39.90++). I ordered medium and my wife ordered well done. We were served the complimentary walnut salad with consisted of a plate of greens with 3 half walnuts on the side. When the main course arrived I was aghast to see my wife's steak was actually medium rare and mine was rare. We immediately called over the waiter and explained that the steak was not cooked as per our order. When we told him we ordered well done and medium he suggested we had ordered the wrong thing and that for medium we should have ordered well done and for well done we should have ordered extra well done. I was shocked. I laughed at his suggestion and told him we we're not eating this and that he should take it away and we want it cooking as we originally ordered...he took it away and 10 minutes later he returned with the exact sam plates and the steak had clearly been placed in a microwave oven, the steak was incredibly tough at this point. We spoke to the waiter once again and told him we were not happy with the meal. He then said he would ask the manager to come and speak with us....LOL!...The manager arrived...some young french girl who had clearly never even managed a greasy spoon cafe let alone managed a restaurant! She asked what was the problem and we explained the whole sorry saga again. She asked did we want a replacement to which we replied "yes". 23 minutes later we had a replacement meal. Mine was ok, however my wife was still cooked medium. At this point we thought f k it. We ate what we could and decided to pay and leave. At the checkout the manager (Estelle) gave us our bill (S$158) and never once asked us was every thing ok. I mentioned this to her and she said she didn't ask because her view was if we didn't complain again then everything must have been ok. Her arrogance was beyond belief. Even though the Duxton Hill experience was great, we will never go to either again because of the terrible service at Suntec City.BE AWARE!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU LIKE TERRIBLE ARROGANT SERVIC

I spent some time reviewing steak restaurants before settling upon L'Entrecote. The restaurant itself is a great little place, in Duxton Hill, and the atmosphere and decor inside the restaurant was fabulous, quaint old lights, walls lined with bottles. Very atmospheric. The menu is simple but expected. The staff were very attentive and helpful. Regrettably the food however, was not quite up to expectations. The French onion soup was piping hot, and looked every inch like a tasty bowl of soup, but unfortunately there seemed to be very few onions and it was quite watery, definitely not what I was expecting. The steak came with the sauce poured all over it. I did not appreciate this, I had expected this to be in a separate jug so that I could pour. I did not enjoy the sauce but that is my taste I guess. The steak was quite tough and chewy and disappointing. Such a shame as the restaurant looked so promising. My usual test of a good restaurant is whether I would pay a return visit. In this instance I'm afraid not
3
I ate there with my wife and 4 year old child. We were there during lunch time within a festive week. It was quite easy getting a table. The whole place was pretty empty.Interestingly, the hostess seat us one table away from a couple having a meal and conversation. The whole place was empty and actually through out the meal I was a bit concerned about my son making noises and disturbing the couple. The hostess could have seated us better.The food is so-so. We ordered 3 entres. Only one of them the "Duck Leg" is delicious. We ordered Creme Brulee for desert and it doesn't taste nice at all.The overall environment is alright and the staff seems friendly and eager (although only two tables were occupied when we were there).I would come back again but only after I tried the other places nearby
5
Midweek lunch
Attentive sevice.
Had set menu -glass of wine ;mixed leaves with walnuts in tasty dressing; fabulous steak, perfectly cooked medium rare in a tasty sauce.
Unlimited fries.
29$ good value.
Unfortunately drinks were very expensive.
But
We would definitely go again.
2
Lunched at the Suntec City branch. Rather pretentious maitre d', food is average, the sauce is not at all authentic, weird head-banging music playing too loudly. No .... won't be back.
3
Have randomly chosen this restaurant as lunchtime crowd in Suntec was really busy then on a Saturday. This was one of the only few restaurants that did not look busy probably due to price since French food?? We were initially attracted by their lunch set meal - burger set. In the end, we ordered escargot as starters, main course : seabass and duck confit with rice. We like the seabass and their famous butter sauce the best. The duck confit was alright except can see visible fats from the thigh which can be a turn off. Escargot was bland. They were not generous with bread though. The coffee was terrible as a glass of wine is expensive. The restaurant is a fusion of French/American with loud music playing in the air. I can see mostly expats with mix of Asians and children are allowed in the restaurants probably due to the casual setting. The service staff looked busy and stress. The table like French setting but the whole room/atmosphere looks very casual. Dark with spotlights all over. The restaurant has potential but I think they can improve on their concept better
4
The simplest menu I have ever seen, made choosing of the food much faster. We started of with the famous escargots, which I thought was delicious! The main course is just one in the menu, which is steak and fries. The steak was cooked to my liking, perfect medium rare and the fries were thin and crisp. We didnt get a dessert because we were too stuff! I will go back there again.
2
Went for an early dinner and it was fairly empty...so got a table easily. The restaurant filled up rapidly after that, so going early is best.Had an onion soup for starters and although the bread and gruyere topping was good, the soup easily was thin and on the salty side.Main course was of course steak and frites. My heart sank when I saw the steak drenched in the house "secret" sauce. A great steak is never dunked in sauce. I asked for the steak to be done medium rare, but it came close to medium. The steak beneath the sauce was stringy and had tendon. It was tender but lacked taste. And I couldn't make out the direction of the sauce.Dessert was their lava cake with salted caramel ice cream. Let's just say the highlight of the meal was the ice cream, not the cake and everything leading up to dessert.A very forgettable meal in the guise of a French bistro. The proprietor of this restaurant seriously needs to rethink the preparation of the food. But then it could just be me because the restaurant was full when I left
4
Was lucky enough to be invited for lunch at this restaurant - the street where it is situated in Duxton Hill is nice and cosy, the restaurant looks authentic French and service was good.We had the Duck Foie Gras for starters and that was quite a big serve for lunch but ohh so tasty. When the steak came with its fries and salad and the sauce it was perfectly cooked and the taste was great. Although I couldn't actually eat desert I had to try the one with the icecream, the merinque and chocolate sauce - and that is also one which should be tried :-
1
In the kitchen of L'Entrecote is a man who can cook. Unfortunately, the person managing front of house has the organisational capability of a shaved monkey. It was so bad it was funny. Ordered a glass of champagne and some wine. Champagne was flat - clearly the bottle had been open for too long. we told them and asked for a replacement... answer: "we've run out of champagne for the day" ..? My pate and Fin's ceasar salad arrived. 15 mins later, H's soup "was still being prepared". We cancelled the soup and suggested our main courses come together. Mine arrived after 10 mins. No sign of the other two. 10 mins go by.... the 3 of us ate my very well cooked steak and chips and as we finished, the two burgers arrived. To make the experience worse. We tolerated service that would have caused a riot in a badly managed prison and watched two of the staff enjoying a leisurely lunch whilst the restaurant remained in chaos. Do not ever, ever, ever eat in the is restaurant until you read reviews confirming the manager has been taken in to the basement carpark of Suntec and put out of his misery
2
I was at the Suntec branch on a friday evening. We were served our appetizer and had to wait 30mins!!! for our mains to arrive. The service was terrible due to they were full house and were shorthanded. The tables who arrived later than us were served their mains much earlier than us. They forgot about our orders. We had to keep asking them for our food. It was mad. I used to visit quite often but would like to avoid after this eventful day.
1
Great location. Thats it! There is a saying in Singapore, trying to find value invariably leads to disappointment. This place fits that bill. Its also destroying the brand!Not sure any of the staff know a chateaubriand from their rump - or where France is! Sadly the manageress doesn't seem to care! Needs a pull through from the top down. Until then - AVOID!There is better value for money elsewhere in Duxton. Better aperitif, better food, better wine and certainly better service! Great food and service to be had at Latteria and La Maison Fatien
2
Unfortunately, my visit was kind of a disappointment. I have always enjoyed their sister restaurants in London, NY and Geneva but the standard at the Singapore restaurant isn't even close to it. First of all is the air conditioning not working properly so the temperature is uncomfortable. Tables are to narrow to each other and waitress acts like first day at work. The meat, fries and famous sauce is not even close to the standard. Avoi
4
They only have 1 main course and for good reason ... Its perfect !
They have welcoming sparkling drinks and a good service .
The restaurant does not take reservations and its actually a good thing !
4
If it's a steak you want. Steak you'll get. Simple concept. Flat fee for steak (either small or large) it's the ONLY entree: with add-ons for appetisers and deserts. Lively venue, not too noisy, with a good ambience and decor. A smart set of diners. Worth a visit. Good value for business lunches; date night and groups of friends.Like the option of carafes for the wine; as you can switch between courses. Tres bon
3
We dined at their Suntec City branch. This restaurant was recommended by a friend and we really came here just for the steak and fries, which didn't disappoint. It was not the best steak but was pretty good. It was cooked according to our preference and I was a big fan of the sauce.I also ordered a glass of their red wine (Bordeaux) which went perfectly with the steak. For dessert, we ordered the salted caramel lava cake which was also pretty good
4
Very decent steak for the price. The strips are just the way they should be and you probably either love it or hate it, thin, content less and a little bit like chewing paper. The steak on the other hand was lean, without tendon but tasteful. Avoid the heavy sauce and just go for the steak and walnut salad
4
As an avowed carnivore, L’Entrecôte is my idea of heaven- the only main course is steak! Not just any steak though, a mouth-watering entrecôte steak accompanied by a fresh green salad and refillable fries, at the end of the meal we were completely full. Although located in Duxton Hill, the atmosphere of L’Entrecôte reminded me of a Bistro I used to visit in Paris (tables very close to each other, waiters running around, plenty of glasses of wine on each table!) reflecting the authenticity of the restaurant
2
** This review is for L'Entrecote French Brasserie in Suntec **The only reason why I'm rating this restaurant as "Poor" and not "Terrible" is because I didn't even step foot into it, so I can't judge for the food or atmosphere. I rang up for a reservation on a Friday evening and I got a guy telling me that their reservations were full. Even before I could ask if I could walk in to try for a table, he said, "OK. Bye." and promptly hung up.I understand that Friday nights are busy but this was incredibly impolite. If the service is like that on the phone, I dread to think what it's like in the restaurant. I'm avoiding this place at all costs from here on
2
We dined at the Suntec city restaurant. It took them about 5 min to serve our food after the order was taken. Seems like the food were pre-cooked. We had the Onion soup which was lukewarm and bland, tasteless pasta salmon, think slice of steak which was not worth the price ($29.90) - was cooked medium well when we requested for medium rare, Escargots and Salad Nicois. It seems that they were in a hurry for us to finish our meal even thought there were only few diners. Before I could finish my soup, the salad was served. Service was really poor. And for a French restaurant, they do not even have a soup spoon. It was a bad dining experience
2
Food is ok. Thin slices of meat. However, the air conditioning is horrible. It was so hot that we had to move outside for dessert. Service is also bad as no one tended to us when we moved outside to get better air. We could have stood up and walked away.
5
I can see a mix of good and bad reviews here. Firstly, I use the palate card that offers 50% discount when dining with one other. So that makes the meals here extremely reasonable. With regards to the water on offer, we always opt for the normal water as opposed to the still or sparkling options.I always order the steak and fries while my wife orders the chicken dish. Both are always good, we like the free flow of fries that come with the steak though you have to ask for it or they will not be refilled.Service is good and we always leave this place happy. Have yet to experience the bad service experienced by the other reviewers
1
One word summary: Unethical.Visited the suntec outlet on Father's day hoping to have a nice time with my wife and my parents. Food was ok, service was bad and I think what you guys are doing with the still water is plain unethical. $18++ for water that I didn't want is ridiculous. When I asked the cashier why I was being charged $18 for water, she said that's the price of their product. Yeah sure, I wasn't given a choice for any other option. I was asked "sparking or still"? You even opened a 2nd bottle without asking. Cost wasn't made known either. It should be made known that there is also an option of "ice water". You may defend and say we didn't ask. Sure, you make my $18 now but no matter how good your food is, and it really isn't, I'm never going back again. Neither are my friends. Ask yourself if it's worth it, since you're pretty new to Suntec. No wonder you changed FB page when your previous FB page has so many 1 star reviews. You may say other restaurants do this too, unfortunately you don't command the status, neither is your steak Wolfgang Puck quality, your price isn't $650, so don't try charging lay people who just wanna have a $20+ father's day dinner $18 for water. Feel free to explain your style of management and bad service.PS. Your "still" water contains high amounts of sulphate and doesn't even taste that great

My French colleagues told me they quite liked this place so I went ahead and organised a group dinner there. As we were in great company with overseas visitors and old friends, we were able to have a good evening despite the shortcomings. I in particular (and a young visitor from Bangladesh who has been to France) did not quite appreciate the steak, neither the sauce. I heard some reviewers say that the steak was huge but mine was small, thin (cut in six slices) and bland on its own. I asked for the sauce to be served separately as I was told it has a rich sourish taste and did not want it drowning my steak in case I did not like it. True enough, it was too sourish (like yogurt sour) and very rich (probably a lot of butter). The French in our group were quite happy with the steak although only 2 (out of the 7 in the group) were offered second helpings. And we were not offered additional fries until most of us were quite done with our meals and the ones who wanted had to ask after more than 15 minutes into the meal. The 2 waitresses were very sombre looking and just did their work robotically with no warmth and no smile. The 2 waiters were a bit better, more trying to be efficient than being friendly. The desserts were good especially the Salty Butter Caramel Lava Cake although it was too sweet. The profiteroles were a tad dry probably from being in the fridge? The cost of the appetisers and the desserts were equivalent to those in hgher-end restaurants so in the end the bill still did amount to quite a lot. I guess on my part, this is not how I like to eat steak. Perhaps one needs to first appreciate and really like the sauce and opt to have the steak rare or medium so that the taste of the sauce is absorbed by the meat. Otherwise, this is not the place for you as there is only one main course option. And this restaurant advocates a 'no reservation policy' and they also will not give you a table until your whole group is present (or at least most of them)

I went there with my friends expecting the same experience as we had at L'Entrecote in France and the UK but got disappointed. The classic dish was made different here. Salad had a simple vinaigrette sauce with whole walnuts thrown on top instead of the creamy/ Caesar dressing w cut walnuts mixed together. The meat was ok but the sauce was very different. This defeats the purpose of this style of restaurant where you expect consistent quality and taste in any outlet across the world. Ah, and as other people already said, service is just about average.

Having frequented the Relais de Venise in Paris, I was excited to try L'Entrecote at Duxton Hill in Singapore. Despite having to queue at any time of the night and any day of the week, the Parisian restaurant never failed to deliver in terms of food, service, ambiance and overall experience. Clearly I was expecting too much from the establishment in Duxton Hill.The online menu boasts 'an unlimited supply of crisp, golden French fries complimented by our hand selected L’Entrecôte red wine'. Perfect. I ordered the Entrecôte steak with its legendary sauce, golden French fries and walnut salad, and a carafe of the L’Entrecôte house red wine. The waitress apologised that they had run out of the house wine and invited me to make another selection. Surprised, I asked her to please check and she returned 5 minutes later with a carafe of what I assume was the house wine.The walnut salad arrived but was very uninspiring. Nevertheless I was half way through eating it when the waitress arrived with my steak. Without saying a word she picked up my salad as I was eating and moved it the other side of the table and plonked the steak down in front of me, and then swiftly left. 'But, but,...'. The steak was good, the sauce was good. It was only 10 minutes after I had finished my meal that the waitress asked if I wanted more fries. I informed her that I had already finished my meal 10 minutes ago. She walked off.Later she returned and asked if I had finished with my salad. I informed her that I was still eating it when she brought the main course. She walked off.Meanwhile, a young couple had arrived and were enjoying their walnut salad at the table opposite me. They were newly dating and engrossed in each other's company, only picking at their meal between animated conversations. Keen to learn whether my experience was an unfortunate one-off or common practice for this restaurant, I stayed to observe.Sure enough, before they had finished their salad the main course arrived and their salad plates relocated. I noticed a mild look of astonishment on their faces, but they were in love and nothing was going to spoil that.By this time the restaurant was half full, and rather sterile with no ambiance whatsoever, and certainly with no need to rush the customers through. I declined the desert on principle and promptly left with no intention of returning

Have eaten here 3 times. Love love the steak and fries. Not the best steak I've ever had but still very tasty. Portions are huge especially after they come with seconds. Love the buzz, ambience and décor of this restaurant. It is ideal for a group of friends to meet up for a weekend dinner. Wouldn't recommend for a couple as the tables are very very close together so lack of privacy

Dined at the suntec outlet on the eve of Mother's Day - it was such a wonderful experience. The food was awesome - we ordered the steak & duck confit as main - both are very good especially the steak - the sauce is so unique, the meat is so good. As for the appetizer - don't miss the pâte - it was so smooth - it just melt in your mouth, it goes so well with the bread. Dessert is heavenly - chocolate lava, profiteroles, and vanilla ice cream - are so amazing. The suntec outlet also has a really nice bistro feel....feel like I'm in Paris :)) service is excellent too. I'll certainly return :

gave my bestie a birthday treat there and the steak and truffle fries were pretty tasty. the guy who served us was nice and attentive. Changed my seat to a better seats when available. Will return since is in town. I was at the pacific plaza branch

Just came back from a meal at the Suntec Outlet, didn't quite feel like it was money well spent due to the service.The food was good. Had the escargot, mussels, beef tartare, duck confit and the steak frites. They were all done well. The escargot was flavoursome, mussels were cooked just right, duck leg was falling off the bone, steak done just right. I don't see why there is a need to have excessive mounds of fries on just about every dish. Looking around, I didn't see many polished plates because of the sheer amount given.The service was sorely lacking. It started out okay, water was promptly served. However we had to get them to bring more menus for my family who arrived after me and had been seated for over 10mins. They have this thing where they write your order on the paper table covers. We were told that this was so when the dishes arrived, the servers know where each dish went at the table without having to ask who ordered it. It didn't matter anyway, we were still asked.We wanted mussels to share as a starter (it's listed as a main). After confirming twice, my escargot arrived without the mussels. We were asked a couple of times if we had been served, which was nice but nothing came back from it. And we had to call for attention to ask about it a few times more. Half hour later, they came. It was all down hill from here. Forget that we poured our own wine, and water was rarely topped up. It seemed like the wait staff and kitchen staff do what they like and not what is requested. After a while of trying to get the wait staff over and to ask for water, she preferred to start clearing our table first instead. Clearing and serving opposite the seated person at the table isn't quite nice, conversations were interrupted quite a bit because of it.We were never asked how our meal was, and the icing on the cake? We finished our meal just after 9pm, i asked for the bill from the staff topping up water in our glasses, which went ignored, then I failed at at getting anyone's attention.. They were busy setting up the tables for the next day and shutting down. I looked over at the bar, I see the manager on his laptop looking at facebook. Gave up and decided to go to the counter to make payment. Nevermind the lack of serivce attention, but Facebooking when you still have guests in? Pretty bad if you ask me.I'd be cautious about going because of the service, which isn't good when the place was about 75% full (at this time could be forgiven), but it gets worse when it's pretty empty

I have a dinner at L'Entrecote today.I ordered medium rare and agree that their streak is good. But the bad part is their appetiser and desert. I had leek and vinaigrette. It was good if I went to some friend who might be just start cooking. The leek was very hard and sticky, not anywhere near tender. The vinaigrette was added with chopped shallots. Too sour and not tasty. The desert I ordered lava cake which was put on the menu is desert of the house. The cake is almost like rubber and inside lava have a rock solid of un-melted caramel. Service is average.Unimpressed !All-in-all. Steak is good but don't think about something else

i was here to celebrate my birthday but the experience was not a celebratory one. The service was sloppy where the waiter served my dish by dropping it instead of placing it in front of me and he did the same over my shoulder across to my friends and had to ask several times before getting our water glass refilled.I had onion soup as starter and it tasted really blend. When i asked the waiter about it, his reply was that many customers did feedback that it's watery but that's the 'style' of their soup and that is why they placed salt and pepper on the table for us to season it ourselves.Their singular main course which is steak was tender and portion was generous but it tasted blend and I had to depend on their 'winning formula secret sauce' for flavour, which is sourish

As the one we know for years at Rue du Débarcadère in Paris, we found in Singapore the good traditional French food in a friendly ambiance. We enjoyed its traditional one meal which is steak with french fries. The paté de Campagne and the rillettes de canard have to be tried as well as the tarte Tatin and the île flottante
3
It was either this, or Wendy's. Loved the fries, steak was not that great, burger was juicy. Will probably come again, if Wendy's was the other choice.
3
Just what they say, entrecotte and fries. Not specially good, neither bad. Service is better than food, what is actually strange in Singapore.
Only go if you really need to eat a steak and don't know any other better place... But there is a lot.
3
Service was good, steak was as expected, fries were amazing!
Bit too cozy with tight table seating but I'll take that over having to wait longer
1
Went with great expectations, however food can be described as poor at best. Worst steak i have ever eaten, undercooked and tasteless. The sauce was so overpowering i thought i was eating lemon curd. The bill was 130 sing and money not well spent. A great shame as on our door step and grossly overrated
1
I arrived alone in the evening around 8pm, got a table pretty quick.Did not like it though as it was of course under a aircon duct, but no other choice so I accepted.Then the waiting started... tables around me started to get filled and orders were taken.I was left aside, after 10 minutes they took my order too. Staff is very very unprofessional and my waiter had missing teeth... eeeehhh? Please who hired him to serve in a restaurant... OMG.I ordered the large entrecôte, medium. Arrived after 15 minutes. Fries were almost cold and the meat only a little warmer.Did not want to complain as I was hungry. The meat was ok but thats it. Fries as well...Sauce, whats the hype about this sauce? Every house made béarnese sauce is better. The house wine at 10 SGD is a rip off, well okay as wine in Singapore in general. Asked for the check and got more money back than supposed to.Okay I accepted with a smile and went away. The cashier takes the total amount of the bottom, which is the total of the bill... The due change is somehow in the middle. Hope thats not their rule otherwise the owners will not be happy.Would I recommend? Well if you like a fast food steak yes, if you like quality no.Its comparable to the lousy steaks of Outback in Singapore. Anyways what happened to Outback? They were top dollar some years ago..

We've been to the Duxton branch twice now and if steak frites is your thing it's well worth it. As the name implies, there's only one main course, entrecote either a large or very large portion with "free flow" fries and a green salad. On both occasions the steak has been cooked exactly as we all liked it and service is polite and attentive.There's a good choice of French starters and desserts. We've enjoyed the starters, I've gone for the snails both times, such that he staff remembered the second time. We've never got as far as the desserts. Wine choice is good though we've only ever had the house red and white, which has been good value.The bistro decor all adds up to the Parisien feel, even if we are 6,000 miles away. Well worth it compared to some much more expensive options
4
Dinner here was a nice change from the Asian dining I had been doing for a few weeks. The steak was tender though a bit drowned in sauce. A complimentary glass of Kir was a nice start. The staff offered more fries. Meal comes with a green salad
5
Reading other reviews there must be more than one L'entrecote in Singapore. This is the one just off Duxton Road. Went with 3 others. You cannot book, but midweek there was no queue. We had the speciality of the house - which everyone else seemed to be having. Excellent rare, succulent steak, delicious bearnaise sauce and great chips. The best bit was, just as you thought you had eaten it all, they refilled your plate! Great house red at a reasonable price too. Fantastic

Went during lunch-time, it was one of the few places in the Suntec dining hall with no line for entry.We lingered at the front for a short while before a waiter finally paid attention to us and then pointed us towards an assortment of available tables.It then took them a very long time to come and take our order, and we were not served water without asking.The place tries to have an image of being posh but seemingly doesn't know if it is a restaurant or more of a cafe.We ordered the lunch special burger ($14.95++). Food arrived in a timely fashion and mine was not bad, but my colleague's was well under done. When we asked them to re-do it, the waitress tried to claim it was medium, when it was obviously rare. (we also weren't asked what temperature we wanted the burgers cooked to).The re-did the burger and it was fine afterwards.The cheque came quickly!Overall a pretty disappointing and drawn out experience. the food was fine, but really unless the meat is some A-Grade I was not aware of, you couldn't had a more fulfilling experience at McDonald'

Really loved this place on previous visits. This time was such a let down. Firstly, they rushed us so that it felt as though we were in MacDonalds. We had barely sat down before we were hassled to order, and then the main course turned up before we had even started our salad. Clearly just wanted us out so they could get the next bill-payers in our seats! The steak was not great - which is supposed to be their selling point. Th house wine, which was pretty good and robust last time, has been changed and felt like a $50 rip off. Has the place changed management? Need to concentrate on quality rather than bums on seats or whill soon lose their reputation and customers. Sad!!!
2
My steak was tough as old leather. Really quite amazed this place can stay in business given this is the ONLY main. Entrée was great but wont be visiting again. Seating very crampe. d
5
Excellent choice if you are tired of the local fare. One item on the menu, steak and their secret sauce, unlimited french fries
3
We liked the food, french brasserie style, at a good price. It is not fancy or exquisite, but it is honest and comfortable
3
Do not go L'Entrecote if you expect to eat a top quality meat.The starters they have are relatively good, we had the foie gras et pate de campagne.But what to say about the main course.Not the beef you would expect to get in a french restaurant.In addition to that the service is not the most friendly you could find
1
Horrible food as I would like to say. The meat on the steak was very hard to chew on and it was quiet hard to swallow as well. I have been to l'entrecote in paris and it was very different from what i expected to have in singapore. I was very disappointed as the steak was too overcooked and the meat that was supposed to be juicy has lost all the juiciness. There was also lack of sauce that accompanied the hard meat steak and when i asked for more sauce,they would like to charge SGD5 just for the sauce. I wouldn't recommend to dine there although i saw many more of the menus. The main attraction of the course as in the paris is the steak and fries with the special sauce but nothing was special as it was in singapore. Very disappointe

We arrived without booking and were asked to wait a few minutes outside with a drink while they got a table ready. The place is is a nice area and has local charm. I can't say that the lady Maitre D' (Maitresse D'?) was effusive with her welcome but my goodness, she was briskly efficient and the serving team were well drilled. Once seated, we had our order taken immediately - not hard, they do steak and frites only - and there was a glass of wine in my hand within seconds. Just what I needed. The food arrived very quickly: The meat was perfectly cooked, flavoursome and tender too, the sauce rich without being overpowering and the fries were not over-salted. The portions were generous; I couldn't eat all of the meal. Good value for money. Very happy indeed and would return

Starting from the start.. We called to make a reservation but apparently they did not accept any, so we got there early to try to get a table. Sat outside for over 45min with little to no update from staff. Placed our orders and very specifically asked that for the steak sauce be served on the side to which the wait staff noted and affirmed. I ordered the Homemade duck foie gras terrine.. my bad for not asking what terrine meant (I was expecting the pan friend type). All the same, it was average at best. Free flow of fries as advertised.. nothing to complain about there. Great if you like your carbs. The steak was a different story. The Steaks:The quality of the steak itself was just a little better than the stuff u get at foodcourts. Tad larger but if you are the kind of person that really savours your cow, you will know that true quality wasn't even average.Next, the website advertised 2 servings of steak. Naturally we were expecting a second portion to come at some point only to be told that they had put the equivalent of both portions on our 1 serve - 200g topS! . SERIOUSLY?! Why would you advertise 2 servings, a) serve our "2 portions" in a single serving, b) that was really less than the size of one standard portion anywhere in the world, c) without our asking, d) shrug us off when we ask, e) then go ahead to the next door table to provide their second serving??! why?The plus side imo is the sauce. It is a pretty tasty sauce that the steak is apparently cooked in. I must say that I suspect it plays a major part in the other good impressions of this place because it completely masks the actual meat quality. Oh but wait... didn't we ask for sauce on the side?!So heres the thing, my sister is gluton intolerant (just shy of Celiac disease). So here came the steaks all soaked in sauce right? When we raised the point that we had requested all sauce to be served on the side, guess what, the gave her a portion with the sauce just flicked or wiped off. Naturally we called the lady manager again who flicked us off again and just said "its not our policy to serve with sauce on the side". Seriously?! policy? firstly your staff should not have acknowledged and accepted our request if it wasn't policy. Fine staff will be staff. You most certainly should not have just wiped off the sauce and served it all the same. Yes YOU because you were solely responsible for distributing the meats from the platter that came out of the kitchen. Also, saying 'not our policy' and trying to walk off before a customer can respond is completely unacceptable. I accept your subsequent apology after nailing your bottom to the floor as to whether you or your restaurant would bear the medical consequence of a gluten caused reaction by my sister. I guess its hard to worm you way out of it when public liability is involved. The starters aren't too bad relative to price relative terms. Think of this place as budget french dining with budget staff, fantastic sauce and lousy cow. Oh ya.. and cramped.. very tight space. Please tell me if you disagree... we'll have our doctors assist you with your query

This review is more about the service here than about the food because I'm still waiting for my steak to arrive and it's been more than a 20 minutes since we were finally given our cold appetizers. Probably a one off experience here but thought it worth sharing. We were initially moved to a different table after being seated for about five minutes so they could make space for a larger party. Then after orders were taken have been promptly forgotten by the wait staff, three other tables that arrived after us were served full meals while we weren't even given bread and now I guess they have forgotten about our meal because steaks still aren't here while other tables have been served! Frustrating

This is a steak and fries resto and they offer nothing else. So you must like steak to come here. The staff, most especially the Westerners, can get snooty. They do not accept reservations except for big groups. We once booked a big table for 10 and they wouldn't let us sit down, even if they already reserved our table for us. We were about 6 already and the snooty Westerner waiter wouldn't let us sit. What's the point??? They already reserved our table and our companions were 10 minutes away. Plus we were celebrating 3 birthdays. They could be more flexible and service oriented in this sense. But I doubt they would care, because a lot of people go there. But there are better places to go to in the area, so they'd better improve.In addition, the place is TINY, and the tables are sooo close to each other so you really have no privacy. In fact, it's sooo cramped that they have to pull out the table to let you sit on the cushioned seats near the wall. Yes, that small
4
You get what the name says - steak and fries and it's a bistro not a 5 star restaurant. So, if you are looking for something simple yet tasty, this place is worth your time and money. I've been here twice with my husband and would definitely come back whenever we feel like 'steak and fries' The serving size is good and the sauce they put on the steak is very yummy. If you finish your fries, they'll stock it up again
5
The l'entrecote in Singapore is a good place when you like steak and frites. The Restaurant is in good location and easy to reach. Might be busy during weekends as they do not take reservations.
4
We had a quiet dinner here. Very good atmosphere and decent food. The service made a difference, delivered with a smile.
5
Really love steak so the concept of this restaurant really appealed to me. The starters and desert list were great too and the choice was a lot wider. Nice house wine and great atmosphere in restaurant. Wouldn't recommend if you don't like sitting close to other people, but I didn't find it a problem because everyone is chatting away so not the kind of place people are listening into your conversations
1
My wife and I ate at L'entrecote recently, and quite honestly it was the worst food I've had in Singapore, and indeed possibly anywhere in recent memory. My wife ordered some foie gras terrine to start, and upon arrival noted that it was 'wet' - it certainly looked very unappealing to me. She was able to eat maybe two knifefuls on the toast, but had to give up after that. The texture was terrible and the foie had not been properly prepared at all.The only main dish available is the supposedly famous entrecote with the special sauce and frites. The meat simply didn't taste of anything resembling beef. It was absolutely dreadful quality meat. There isn't really anything else to say about that. The supposedly golden crisp frites were mass catering frozen chips that bore virtually no resemblence to the frites you might expect in Paris (or virtually any other city). The entire dish was totally unappealing and devoid of any decent flavour.The service was good and pleasant enough, and the wine was drinkable (just), but I could never recommend this restaurant to anyone. I am familiar with the 'L'entrecote' concept from Paris and London, and it is good, but if you are only really serving one thing, you have to do it really well, and this restaurant fails in every respect on that front. Even their story about the origins of the concept on their web page is wrong
4
If you like steak frites, then this is a must try. Gets rather busy quite early so try to get down early to snag a table (no reservations). Ambience is nice, decor has a french feel to it and the service was efficient with attentive staff.

My wife and I were able to take a night out leaving the kids with the family during our trip though Singapore from Bangalore. We were looking for a classic, simple no fuss restaurant and loved the atmosphere at L'Entrecote. Service was quick and friendly but not intrusive, the food was perfect and a nice but small wine list. A little gem in the heart of Singapore

L'Entrecote Singapore provides an almost-perfect version of Parisian entrecote - right down to the great vibe, crowded seating, single choice of main course (and house Burgundy), free-flowing fries - and excellent entrecote and sauce. The coffee is good, the deserts excellent. The only thing lacking is visible, strong management. The staff are mostly efficient, but not perfect. A bit of training - and a personable, highly-visible, hands-on, experienced manager with a Parisian accent would turn this place from four stars into five.Note: If you've not tried entrecote before, don't go here expecting a range of main courses. The steak is why you go here. If you want a greater range, there are other places that do this - if you want steak frites with a great sauce, and only that, come here
2
Went for dinner anticipating a good meal. The appetisers, salad and desserts were up to their usual standards. The servers, whilst friendly enough, hurried us through our meal and attempted to clear plates even though we had clearly not finished. Couldn't understand what the rush was as the restaurant was not full. The meat was the great disappointment. It was a piece of mystery beef that looked and tasted more like a flank steak. Whilst it was well cooked, it was not what the restaurant advertises - an 'entrecote'. We had been to this restaurant many times before and were served the 'correct' cut but not this time. Disappointed

We have visited L'entrecote in Geneva several times, and it one of our favourite places to eat when we are there. However, as we are now living in Singapore we decided to go to the newly opened Singaporean version, and compare. Our first impressions were good as we were met at the door by a friendly staff member, most Singaporeans are friendly though, and he guided us to a table. All the tables, at both Geneva and Singapore, are very close together, so be warned if you are expecting the usual space between you and the next table. The service is very swift, at both places, and our 'waitress' came to our table very quickly to take our order. We asked that the food not be brought out until we had finished our aperitif, but they brought it out too soon, before we had got half way through our drinks, so we sent it back, and they apologised. The wine selection is excellent and we enjoyed an enjoyable Australian vintage--but then we are fans of Australian wine, so are unashamedly biased. The food is very good as the steaks were cooked as we asked, and the sauce for the steaks (that's all you can order) was as good as that at Geneva. However, in Singapore they don't give you a fresh plate when you've finished the first steak and chips, as they do in Geneva, and we prefer the Geneva way--yes, you have two portions of both anyway, so go hungry.The staff are great here, we had fun, and they are much more friendly than in Geneva, where you really have to work at communicating with the staff.The bill was very reasonable for what we had. So, which did we prefer, Geneva or Singapore? Well, without a doubt, it has to be Singapore, as we had a great evening there. So, will we be going back? Yes, definitely

L'Entrecote is located at the increasingly trendy Duxton Hill area. I frequent this French bistro about once a month as it is consistently good. There is only one main course to speak of (steak & french fries) but a variety of excellent starters (and desserts) to choose from. They don't take reservations (which I think is good) and the idea is to stop by for a quick meal to satisfy your steak & fries craving rather than a long drawn-out 4 course meal. You get the feeling that they want to turn tables quickly (which is fair enough). The service is good nevertheless.Last night we started with a bottle of their house red - a generic Bordeaux that carries the L'Entrecote label. We were sitting in the outside area watching the place fill-up (it's been full every time I've visited). We were a little disappointed by the wine: under-ripe, unoaked red with too much Merlot probably. But for $49 you can't really complain.We moved inside and moved onto a lovely 2010 Cotes du Rhone which at $99 was still excellent value I think. One criticism I do have of the place is the rather small servings - I either have to order 2 starters (plus the main) or a starter and 2 mains (!). I can highly recommend the roasted bone marrow on toast with sea salt - the best I've tasted in Singapore! The escargots are similarly very good.As for the 'plat du jour', the beef is juicy and tender and cooked to your preference ('bleu' for me) but the frites are rather mediocre and could be much better.In summary, a lovely place and I look forward to going back
