is a great experience!...the gorgeous food and excellent service.The pasta was homemade and the ingredients were fresh.

I come to Senso for many years already and our dinner last saturday's was another great experience. Great food (Mozzarella with Parma ham - Pappardelle XXLong and Pollame Ruspante) great wine..... and very friendly and professional service. Super restaurant with great atmosphere.
5
Beautiful and comfy place. Great restaurant to try Italian dishes and wine. Lovely outdoor area, faultless service, excellent food. We enjoyed our romantic dinner very much.
5
The food and service is always excellent here. The antipasti, the home made pastas and the wonderful fish dishes are all delicious.
4
This is the usual haunt for hubby and me. Always enjoy the ambience, the gorgeous food and excellent service.
5
celebrated my husband's birthday at the restaurant and they surprised him with a slice of cake and sang the birthday song charmingly and sincerely.
food was nice and the set lunch value was great
5
We were greeted politely by the entrance by a very friendly staff, and she wasted no time to whisked us to our seats.The waiter and waitress were amazing and extremely polite in their service. The food is amazing! The pasta is the best I have ever tried of the different Italians restaurants in Singapore. Will definitely be back again very soon
5
They called me in advance to confirm booking and when I didnt pick up, they followed up by email. When I called back, they were very nice and cheerful over the phone. The restaurant has nice ambience and the staffs were all very professional and made me felt like I was the VIP. The food was good too.
5
Senso is a great restaurant, whether you're there for the ambience the food the wine, it checks all boxes...the black and white decor is lovely whether dining out in the courtyard or inside. Great antipasti salmon tartare, the scallops, the gamberoni were all exquisite. Standard creamy burrata, I got to eat the foie gras off the pumpkin soup of a vegetarian friend who was too embarrassed to ask for it to be left out! The bream wrapped in panchetta was done perfectly as was the veal ravioli and the ossobucco. Definitely a 5 star dining experience with impeccable service and a sommelier who's suggestions were the perfect accompaniment to each course
5
A stunning restaurant in a converted shophouse, you enter through a small door, into a beautiful courtyard, beyond which is the main dining room. We stuck with the set lunch, a choice of four staters, four mains and at S$34 for 2 courses it’s great value. Absolutely delicious food, the crab linguine was awesome, and I’m very keen to return to get stuck into the a la carte. Najib the sommelier deserves a special mention, great advice and selection. I really enjoyed Senso, it’s a fabulous restaurant and I highly recommend it.
5
Senso is perhaps the most reliable and durable Italian restaurant in Singapore, right there on Club street. No matter if there are 2 or 20 of you, the service is excellent and the food is superb,
5
Ambience and service was amazing. The pasta was homemade and the ingredients were fresh. If you have entertainer, you should definitely visit the place!
5
Food selection was great and service was impeccable. Had the free flow prosecco buffet on sunday. Thought you could only ordered the ala carte menu once, but turns out that's free flow too. Well worth the $$ paid.
4
Celebrated my birthday at Senso. The service was warm, the food was good and the ambience was excellent. It’s great for dinner dates or birthday celebrations.
5
Absolutely wonderful service from the attentive staff. Great atmosphere, though the aircon area was a little stuffy and warm.
5
This owner run restaurant has the flair and elegance for a classy night out. The food is consistently good, the black ink squid pasta stood out that night for me, but the service really made it extra special. They truly care about their guests and it is hard not to enjoy that. As we know it is hard to find places of this level, but for great classic italian that is presented with a slightly modern twist served with a smile and capable servers is something you gladly pay for. Price was reasonable enough even for the wine
4
Had my team's xmas lunch and we enjoyed the place. only wish we cld sit on a round table.Some of the food was exceptional - e.g. the salmon tarte, steak.Some were a bit of a miss - e.g. fish skin was not crispy but soggy, lobster bisque was diluted.Service of staff was okay, guess perhaps cos of lunch crowd, they tend to overlook some requests like butter, which we had to ask about 4 times.Overall, it was a great lunch
5
This restaurant is consistently popular for special celebrations particularly for birthday. We were there on Thursday night and it was packed and filled with birthday songs in the evening. The quality of food and drinks is consistent fantastic and it never let me down. Well done Senso !
4
Dedicated wait staff at the bar area - service was good. But cant say that of another wait staff, prob a manager as he was wearing a suit but always looking stern.seafood and pastries were fresh but the mains were just mediocre and some even arrived at room temperature
3
Beautiful space with white walls and a lovely courtyard. The all you can eat brunch though is quite disappointing. The appetiser buffet table contains the usual Italian fare and is fine but nothing really was that great.The pastas were not really that special and the salmon spaghetti was tasteless and pasta soft. The mains were ok and the only dish to talk about was the red snapper - meat was firm and sweet. Other meats and fish were either over cooked or tasteless.Quality seems a bit lacking compared to some other restaurants
5
We've been to Senso many times, and each time is as lovely as the last. The food is fresh and yummy, the service is impeccable and the atmosphere is lovely. Highly recommended
4
Fabulous bread basket. Food and wines never fail. Great service. Will be returning very soon. Keep up the good work
5
Senso experience was great. The Food was excellent! We had Salom Tartare, Homemade Taglierini Pasta, Seafood Soup. Ended our meal with nice Tiramisu...Great evening experience. We will go back again and try out other food......
5
The wine list is excellent, providing a wide range of selection of wine from different countries. The beauty of it is that the restaurant provides the option of ordering the wine by glass. Great food quality and presentation.
5
Attentive service and well executed food. We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday and the restaurant gifted her with a slide of complimentary cake plus birthday song from the staff. Ambience is also top notch.
5
We just needed to say briefly our taste preference and the veteran sommelier immediately brought us a perfect bottle! Food an services excellent as usual.
5
Ambience is perfect for a romantic tete-a-tete even though we noticed there were many business dinners in progress. The squid ink pasta was one of the best I've ever had. The sauce had just the right mix of creamy tomato sauce and the lobster chunks were generous for that price! Hubby's Welsh lamb had him picking up the bones towards the end to clean every last bit of that flavoursome meat. To start with, our starters did not disappoint; I had the salmon tartare - another generous serving, and the foie gras was, as always, satisfying. We shared a lemon tart for dessert which was only slightly above average. The pastry shell was thick and the meringue served with it was too sweet, while the lemon curd itself could be a lot more tangy. That being said, we are looking forward to going back - this time for their Sunday brunch which, word has it, is quite fantastico! Watch this space
5
The location is really great. It has a nice inner courtyard which is perfect for romantic but also for business dinner. There also nice tables inside - there is enough distance between the tables, which is great for private conversions.Service is outstanding and Italian food menu is great. They have a very well selected wine list and their Sommeliers are just outstanding. It is one of the few places you are really getting value for money if it comes to wine (selection).It is actually my favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore
5
Senso is well situated at the bottom of Club Street.The food really is excellent and the service amongst the best in Singapore in my opinion.Lunch is a must with their top dishes available at a very reasonable price - S$40 for the three course is excellent value.In season, the white truffle specials make for a superb gastronomic fare.Away from lunchtime, there is an excellent Sunday brunch featuring the sort of buffet specials you would expect from a top Italian. Dinner main courses feature home made pasta - my Favourite is the hare ragout. At around 35-40 a plate is isn't cheap but is comparable with other quality Italians in Singapore, and I think the actual quality is better than most others.Vegetarians are also well catered for with superb mushroom dishes amongst the offering.All of this is accompanied by a superb wine list , dominated of course by Italians. If you arrive early there is a great little cocktail bar in which to wait.Seating inside is very comfortable but the courtyard makes a real treat if it isn't raining
1
I received a mail shot promoting CIMB Visa card's discount when eating at Senso. Wanting to make use of it, I made a reservation for the Sunday brunch. I mentioned the Visa promotion when making my online reservation. A day later I received a phone call from Senso saying that the discount does not apply to the Sunday Prosseco brunch.Customers may well turn up expecting to take advantage of an advertised discount when they pay with their card, only to be told, "It doesn't apply". In my mind, this is dishonest. I have been going to Senso since 2000 but will not be going again
5
Great service staff who's always wearing a smile. Food is ok, but I love the ambience! Been there a couple of times, but service standard is just as good! 😊
4
Mikael always makes our regular ladies nights on the terrasse a blast! Plus 2 hours free flow of Prosecco under 50$ in the cosier part of Club St is an excellent deal.
3
While the mains and spread were of quality, the service leaves much to be desired. Managers in suits were quick to judge and showed poor service attitudes.
4
Great service and good food. It was our wedding anniversary and they specially arrange a cake for us which its very nice of them. Will definitely visit again.
4
Both the food and the service were excellent from the time we arrived. My Salmon Tartare with pan fried scallops was excellent.
4
My Husband and I decided to do a date night, based on my friend's recommendation. The meal was beautifully presented, the waiters very attentive and the atmosphere was very charming. The prices were rather steep for the size of the portions provided at the restaurant.
4
We had the squid ink tagliorini and the pan fried cod fish both of which were fabulous. However service fell a tad short on that fri night due to overwhelming booking which is uncharacteristic of their usual high service stds.
5
Held a few corporate event here and the most recent was for 30 pax. The set lunch menu offers good 3-course selection and the food is good quality and tasty. Great service. Friendly and helpful staff. Recommended for private dining as well as their menu offers good dishes. The 3 course was a choice of salmon or beef but I only managed to capture my main. The appetiser and dessert is delish too. They also offer us praline & cookies to end our meal with coffee/tea. Sweet!
5
I love truffles and as the season was back on, I really craved a dish, that I had there last year! I know pretty ambitious. Anyway after I made my husband to take me back again, I realised they haven't included it in this year specials OOps. However I inquired and the kind waiter took a picture from my phone and shared it with the chef and they kindly did the same dish, amazing service! I absolutely love this place and can't wait to go back again.
4
Have been going to Senso for business meetings - lunch/dinner for quite a while. It is reasonably priced for a restaurant which has a fairly formal ambiance. The set lunch is really well priced. Food is very good and the wines are priced well - better than some of the other fine dining restaurant
4
Nice ambience for a boozy Sunday prosecco brunch. Food was good and we enjoyed the nice selection of buffet items. Service was impeccable.
5
I was there early evening with my boyfriend by followed review on Tripadvisor. Food is delicious. A lots of wine selections(what we love the most). Excellent service. Great atmoshere. We will be back soon:)
5
Very nice upmarket place in telok Ayer! Staff were really friendly and helpful. Wild certainly recommend! 👍
5
On arrival you are escorted to the dining room past an open courtyard so typical of the Singapore row house. The decor Is quietly elegant. The waiters were welcoming without being effusive. The food was delicious. Altogether a lovely dining experience.
4
Could have been really special if the staff were a bit more attentive, alert, aware. The food us great and the atmosphere too
5
Little Italy in Singapore, pasta are excellent, fish great, lamb tasty, wine list really great! The service is close from perfection, and the Tiramisu a crime against diet. A place to meet with, several times! There you have one risk: turning addict.
5
Great service by all the staffs! Food was great and nicely prepared. A free birthday cake was given to my hubby too!
5
Lovely Sunday brunch with freeflow Prosecco and the added delight of everything served with truffle. My favorite was the risotto cooked a la minute and also the fish. If you're too lazy to get up worry not because half the items can be served at the table. Dessert is also great. Loved the panna cotta. Senso is one of our top restaurants in SG not just for the food but the lovely servers who never hesitate to make sure we have everything we need.
5
If it isn't, then it is mighty close.You name it, they do it - superb menu, excellent wines by the glass, great service and a lovely ambience.They are doing a summer black truffle special at the moment - heavenly ! Truffle and foie gras panacotta is amazing and I followed it with the bucatini pasta with truffle cream , mushrooms and shaved truffle..........a nice Gavi went well with the panacotta and the suggested pairing of a New Zealand Pinot Noir was perfect.I was on crutches and stumbled coming out of the restaurant only to be caught by staff following me carefully out.I cannot recommend Senso highly enough for all these reasons - and an excellent cocktail bar whilst you are waiting to boot !
3
Location in Clubstreet is convenient, and we stepped into an oasis of a calm, classy and smiling environment. Service was excellent. Wish I could say the same of the food which was just not meeting the class of the place. Seriously overpriced for the quality and amount.My sauteed tigerprawns were grilled and very charred/ burned, giving a bitter taste
4
Always fabulous in services. Pasta was excellent, wine was wonderful. And we always get a little nice sweet treat after out meal!
3
Reservation avail on CHOPE app was only 6pm and 8.30pm. Place was empty with lots of seats..not sure why we couldnt have a table at 7pm.
Wine is very expensive for this casual dining, Aircon was not working well.
5
What a charming find. The service was exquisite and the ambience lovely. Not cheap but a great restaurant away from the usual places. Lovely meal.
4
Risotto with duck liver was too good. Angel hair with scallop is great but could have a little more scallop.
Tenderloin medium rare was just great, luckily did not order medium else too cook.
Dessert is simply perfect!
5
Food: Quality over variety. Desserts were really good. Mains were served in tasting portions, great for saving stomach space for other food. Service was perfect. There was some confusion with the reservations and the manager apologised personally. I would definitely return again.
5
Staffs are helpful and nice . They helped me a lot by proving good service, ambience was great. Restaurant was very clean spick and span.
4
I think the food is really good but a bit pricey. Great place to have group lunch/dinner 10+ pax. They also have private dining room with $1000 min spending! Beware of the price ++. Allow ample time eating here the food takes a while to prepare which is understandable. It cost us about SGD80 nett per person inc drinks and a glass of wine.
5
Went here for my birthday. Beautiful fresh authentic food, good veggie choice, not too crowded, extremely friendly staff. The service was excellent. They bought me a complimentary tiramisu with a candle on top. For the price, this is a top quality brunch. The food is of better quality than many other Italian restaurants in Singapore, and the ambiance even better
4
Its a pretty restaurant bustling with people on a Saturday evening that we visited.Its a fine dining restaurant with a few vegetarian options, the asparagus season was in and we got to taste a variety of food made with it. The restaurant is tastefully done up, with very professional and helpful staff!Overall a nice place to visit for a relaxed meal
4
I haven't been to Senso for a long time so I was looking forward to having dinner here. The ambience is as nice as I remembered. Service was professional. They had decent wine list too. The entree I chose - asparagus soup - was average. I had beef cheek for main which was nice but nothing special. But the dessert I had was really good. I had limoncello baba. For this I'm definitively going back
3
dropped in for a drink at the bar. i like the interior decor - nice counter seats and bar top, cosy and great music. a rather extensive drinks menu. good place to have drinks and conversation.
5
Brilliant food and service. Great selection of wine.
We had dinner at Senso. This is a very classy Italian restaurant and good value.
Highly recommended for a special occasion. Bellissimo!
4
Came back here after a long hiatus. Nows the spring asparagus. The menu is fabulous so is the food. Had asparagus soup, veal tenderloin and risotto. Yum
5
Food is amazing!! Service truly impeccable.. The waiters were attentive, friendly n quick with recommendations. Definitely a good place for a romantic night out.
3
Love the courtyard and ambience. Doesn't feel like one is in Sg. However the food was a huge disappointment. Cod was chewy n taste funny. Linguine was overly salted and the artichoke was sour. Money not well spent.
4
Started our evening with cocktails at the separate bar, simply called 'S bar'. Good range of classic cocktails.Dinner in the busy restaurant was an enjoyable experience. Menu offers a good range of choices. Pasta all freshly made in house.Excellent creamy burrata cheese with Iberico ham, pan fried calves liver made for two delicious starter dishes.Followed by seasonal veal with white asparagus and gnocchi and rack of lamb. Again both main courses were excellent.Wine list is very good with lots of regional Italian choices. Great advice from the very knowledgable sommelier. Shared a bottle of Nerello mascalese - a great red wine from Etna region of Sicilia.Desserts were good - lemon meringue tart and of course tiramisu!! Needed more alcohol in the sponge.In summary - a great Saturday dinner in a busy ristorante. At least two birthday parties were being celebrated
3
Brought 4 colleagues here for lunch as cld use 1-for-1 entertainer. All the times I've been here the food and service had always been competent. Very reliable for a business lunch. Not so sure for personal meals as I prefer something that surprises me sometimes. The food is traditionally Italian, hearty and rich. So come here if u want a traditional Italian dinner or a first date. Had the lobster past
5
Premium consumers need not fly all the way to Venice to pamper themselves with gourmet Italian Food & Wines complimented with classic customer service as provided by the celebrated Sommelier running the famed Senso Ristorante @ 21 Club Street, Singapore! Gourmets must not miss the white & green asparagus cheesy risotto in season and the roasted lamb and wild mushroom dishes with the classic Italian desserts.For family reunion gatherings, the ristorante offers ultimate cosy corners for comfort and warm family ambience to be remembered for returning customers

My girl friends and I went to Senso for their dinner menu for Restaurant Week. We get a choice for appetizer, main course and coffee / tea. For dessert, there's only 1 kind. Ambience is classy, quiet, and the tables are well spaced so that you can have full conversations without neighboring tables hearing everything. On to the main part - the food was goooood! We were pleasantly surprised to get a basket with 3 kinds of bread plus breadsticks. Olive oil with balsamic vinegar was served with the bread. We were also served a cheese appetizer before the 1st course. For the dinner itself, I chose Carpaccio di Manzo for appetizer, Branzino for main course, Crostata Valhorna for dessert and tea. Everything was well executed and so tasty! My main course had a healthy portion, so my friend and I decided to split our choices and share. Overall, I'd recommend Senso and even more so for Restaurant Week. I think the quality and the number of courses are very worth it compared to others that served 3 courses strictly. If you and your companion can order different things for each course, that'll work best so you get to try different things.
4
Senso was a great experience. We got seated in the courtyard. The service is good but not much of recommendation given while choosing the menu. The appetiser was Burrata cheese with ham and the quality was good. In the main course we ordered for sea bass. The dish was fine but could have been better. We enjoyed a bottle of Malbec along with food since my friend ordered for a steak. Overall a nice experience
5
Excellent service, the combination of food and wine was perfect. The Chef could alter for vegetarian and the pasta was really good!
4
This place has very nice ambience. Outside looks simple but inside is beautiful.
Service is also good.
Food is above average.
5
Terrific dinner spot. Building illustrates the architectural style of old Singapore. Solid Italian kitchen. Enjoy the truffles, they're extra but are generously applied. Terrific wine list to match.
4
I have been a few times to Senso. Always the same good quality. One of the best Italian restaurants in town
5
Restaurant was informed and was willing to accommodate our late arrival due to tight schedules. Food was fantastic. Service was good. The staff made us feel at home despite all the rush.
5
As soon as we stepped foot into the restaurant, we were taken aback by the fantastic ambience, which had been concealed by a relatively nondescript entrance. While the air conditioning was slightly cold, the seating area was comfortable and service was friendly and prompt. We were there for the truffle menu, and while we did get "truffled out" after a while, truffle servings were incredibly generous and the food was so flavourful. The pumpkin soup was excellent and exceeded my expectations. The Taglierini Pasta was great as well, simple yet flavourful. Finally, the chocolate 'eruption' with truffle was incredibly unique - though I doubt truffle actually added to its flavour, it did add a certain sort of novelty to the dish. My only qualm was that the buratta cheese with mushroom carpaccio tasted terrible, though others may like it
4
We delayed our Vaketines Dinner to have a proper night out. This was our first visit to Denso and won't be the last. Lovely Bread that seemed to be homemade, my wife had the Salmon Tartar and I had the Ham wrapped Mozarelka, for mains the steak and the Beef Cheek, would have loved to have had done Pasta ad well but to be honest two courses was enough. Will definitely be returning, would definitely try there Brunch or Lunch next tim
4
Sunday brunch was good. Great buffet variety, very fresh seafood and salad. Mains were prepared when order was placed and food was served hot in small portion. However, it was very rowdy in the restaurant. Suggest you request for an outdoor or bar seat if you prefer a more peaceful meal.
5
I'd been here for a colleagues dinner and back again for a team farewell before I brought my wife who absolutely loved the dinner experience :)valet parking a must or you'd have to endure a long wait at the public carpark outside during weekdays, better park in the shopping malls across the road and walk overaround it's sprawling yard this restaurant has no shortage of variety in indoor/outdoor seating that should meet your needs~Gamberoni King Tiger Prawns that whet the appetite beautifully YUMz~Filetto di Manzo this Australian Grain Fed Beef with black truffles added (in April early season) was an absolute perfection when rested it arrived exactly medium rare and sliced wonderfully delicious YUMZ x3~Capellini alla Bottarga was simply exquisite YUMz x2~Linguine ai Frutti di Mare was tasty YUMzadded photos from 2015Jan (business farewell lunch in private room) & Apr for just the 2 of u
4
Lucky to visit there during Truffle festival week since I am a truffle lover. My black Angus steak with Foie gras and black truffle was soooooooo good. They didn't ask how I like my steak but the chef apparently knows best and I was gone to juicy steak heaven! I can't get enough of the buffalo mozzarella as well, it goes so well with a 2012 Barolo we picked. The service was very efficient, I like our sommelier very much. Definitely go back next time in Singapore.
5
Very good and attentive service! Well worth the money. We went there using the entertainer app. The pastas were delicious
3
their appetiser of salmon tartare and panseared salmon was great. however the pasta mains were abit underwhelming. Tiramisu was great as well. pehaps we picked the wrong mains.
4
It is a great place to go for celebrations. But I feel that the 4G data signal on my phone is really week (when dining indoors). So I had to go to the courtyard to retrieve my emails - which is very inconvenient. I ordered the squid ink lobster pasta. It was a little salty too. But overall, the atmosphere is great. The service is impeccable
5
Menu of delights is varied, and the themes are brilliant: Do NOT miss the black truffle mealThe sommelier, Najib, is bringing wine and its history in your mind and ensures that the choice is made in a way to enrish the taste of food.Location and service are aligned with the establishment hight standards. It is an experience that you need to budget for if you come through Singapor
5
I had a dinner at Senso and my total experience was really good. Nice atmosphere with friendly staff and excellent service. The food was so delicious. Everything was prepared and cooked perfectly. For appetizer, Burrata cheese & salmon tartare with scallops are must try! We had lamb rack and beef tenderloin for mains which were done perfectly. Excellent job guys
5
A very nice place with yummy food. Very good service, Particularly by Mohammed (Hope I got the spelling right). The pan fried duck liver was really delicious. Unfortunately there was a problem. To be fair, what marred our evening was not the restaurant's fault at all. We were seated next to a table where a man rather boorishly tried to regale his guests with his knowledge on food...from rojak to teochew muay! As he was very loud, we too had to listen to every detail of his local food adventures.
4
Returned after 1 year as my friend wanted to use his app again for one-for-one main courseI started with the salmon tartare and it was ok. My lamb rack was very tasty but small portion. Their tenderloin which i had before and which my friend ordered was also very goodExtensive list of (primarily) italian wines but very overpriced as expecte
5
We had a very nice dinner in this restaurant, with an outside area and elegant inside area. The food was very good and quantity of each dish was important (probably it is too much to have a three course dinner).Burrata as a starter was delicious and I highly recommend the very traditionnal Tiramisu
1
Had a company meal there and the restaurant staff only spoke to the Whites in our group. After the meal, only the whites got a discount card for 30% off next visit. Apparently Asians are NOT welcomed
5
We went there for our wedding anniversary dinner. We asked for a quiet table during reservations and we got what we needed. It was a round table at the corner and we were seated next to each other facing out to the hall. It had enough privacy and yet allowed us to watch happenings going by as we dined. We had two starters - one of king prawn and one of scallops. Both were really good and the portions were just enough. The sommeliers were top notch. Sometimes, unfortunate event with the wine did happened - corked. And the sommelier was the one who detected it when uncorking the bottle and concluded it himself even without asking us to taste. I had to give it to his honesty. This level of honesty is common in good restaurant overseas. But in Singapore, most are not at this standard. We had two yummy soups (a seafood bisque and a artichoke soup), truffles pasta to share; two mains - a braised beef cheek and a tenderloin. The braised beef cheek was excellent in tenderness yet firm and was full of robust flavour. The rest of the dinner went perfectly. In summary, Senso has the class of a Michelin star restaurant in terms of quality of service, ambience and food. Definitely a restaurant that I will make a Long detour at great length to go to.
5
had a good dinner with my wife at senso. we had foie gras and beef carpaccio for starter which was delicious. continued with lamb agnello and risotto which was cooked to perfection. dessert was tiramisu and cioccolata, just simple and perfect for out sweet ending.
5
The food was delicious, made with fresh ingredients. The waitress and waiter made customers feel welcomed!
5
We enjoyed a top class meal here, the food was excellent as was the service, the somilier was really helpful and spent a bit of time going through the wine menu with us.
I've been here a number of times and its consistently excellent.
3
This place has evolved over the years to a higher segment. Without a corporate /business expense to entertain clients esp europeans, i would not have ventured hereMy starter was cheese with tomato (free flow of bread) main was seafood pasta. The tiramisu dessert was most memorable which compensated what was least a dull menu 
5
First time at this place, went with a friend for prosecco brunch. Great experience. Food is very fresh. Some is buffet, but the hot food you can order. It comes in small portions which is perfect. Service is very good. Really a place to go for Sunday brunch
3
Had a birthday party here. Nice wines good desserts. Good service in a more colonial setting. Courtyard garden. We had fish, beef in thick brown sauce and tasty italian breads. Our host had the tables full and we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. We had a show and lots of balloons with cake. Met some new buddies. Organised a few outings
2
I was invited there for dinner because of some credit card promotion. I Hv not been there for almost 2 years ... Glad they did some minor renovation to make the place looks better but kind of disappointed with the food we had today... Burrata cheese, pork n their cod fish :(
3
Came here this week for lunch and opted for the rack of lamb, medium. This was unfortunately a little too rare for my taste (noticeably read for more than half the meat). It was also a bit tough. Service was friendly and efficient though. My lunch partner had one of the fish dishes which she reported as being tasty enough but not exceptional. Long time since I was last here, but I can't say I'll be rushing back
5
This will be my 3rd visit to Sensos in Singapore for 2016.The place is always alive over the weekends . A must try is the angel hair pasta with a light tomato paste and seasonal seafood as a sharing starter.Had the grilled Rack of Lamb coated with gratinated crumbs..thumbs up- pink in the middle - medium done the way I like it !The wine list has some interesting medium priced Italian wines from tuscany and my favourite was the white sauvignon from Valentin Sanct Michael Appiano ..Service is professional and prompt. The selection and types of fish could be more varied ..they obliged this visit by preparing potato dauphinoise for our party of 8.Great dinner and reasonable pricing...Enjoy the Ristorante !
5
We had a dinner for 2 on Saturday evening for a birthday. The service is very good.They have a wonderful list of italian wines probably one of the best in Singapore, if not the best. It's more suitable for couple than for a family with children,If you are looking for fine italian dinning, it's a very good place : amount per pax : between 75 and 100 sgd for 3 courses excluding wine.It's not the first time that we went and we will come back for sure
4
Went for a boozy F1 brunch. The food was all exceptionally tasty, the staff lovely and the champagne was poured on a frequent basis. Lovely space in an old building.
4
Pretty building with a small patio and a main room. The food Italo/French was good without being exceptional but the service the wine list and the deco made a very enjoyable moment overall
3
As we were staying in Chinatown a friend recommended this place for Dinner on a Monday night. It looked interesting from the outside and the patio in the centre was a nice feature. Breads were good, sommelier seemed to know what he was doing, had the lamb for a main but opted out of a dessert. The lamb was average only and the place lacked any sort of ambiance, so much so we were in and out of the place in 1/2 an hour
4
For antipasti, we ordered burrata and King prawn, tenderloin and fish stew as main, peach meringue for dessert. fresh, tasty and prettily presented, is also a beautiful venue for events, I particularly love their court yard. To end sweetly they surprise us with a complimentary slice of birthday tiramisu, both managers sang us a song with their hearts. what's most impressive was they plated "belated" it shows up how attentive to details the managers were. good job to the kitchen and service staff. Overall excellent experience. Will be back!
5
Another place we have gone many times already and keep going back. We always ask to be seated outdoors as this is really nice and a very European ambiance. The food is always consistent in quality, very good pastas and great desserts. Some good wines as well. Will go back for sure
5
Had dinner at Senso on a Sunday night. The restaurant was surprisingly vibrant and buzzing with lots of customers. We ordered salad, pasta and risotto and everything came out perfect. We also shared a tiramisu at the end. Service was impeccable and the ambience was just right. Such a great place to dine at if you're looking for somewhere decent, not overpriced and courteous waiters. Will come back soon

The food here has really gone downhill over the past 15 years that Senso has occupied the same building on club st. While it used to be a place where the social scene of singapore should come for a drink or quick meal it is now more a restaurant that would cater for tourists and people dining with credit card specials (1 for 1 and the like ). Given that they also will close the venue off for private functions that don't actually use the food from the restaurant should tell you everything.

Senso's food, from starters to desserts, was excellent on our last visit. We shared our dishes to give ourselves the chance to try lots of variety, and the quality on offer was consistently high. Burrata with prosciutto was fresh, succulent and tasty. Salmon tartare with pan fried scallops was also very well executed. Pan fried foie gras was also very well prepared and presented, oozing richness and smoothness in equal measure.Main courses of braised beef cheeks and pappardelle with ragú were both delicious, and were hard to fault. The beef cheeks were tender, juicy and deliciously rich. The pappardelle were perfectly cooked, and the ragú was also excellent.Given the quality of the output from the kitchen, therefore, it is disappointing to have to record that the service was pretty abysmal. Inattentive waiters that left us with empty wine glasses and dirty plates on several occasions, and who showed little interest in taking our food orders from the very start.When you are paying around $250 per person, it shouldn't be necessary to call a waiter over to bring your wine to your table every time a glass is empty. Surely, at that price point, the waiter should be dedicated to only one or two tables, and should certainly be visible in the dining room at almost all times?We would go back for the food because it was that good, but with the expectation of poor service and the need to call for assistance whenever you need anything

Senso's well curated menu of traditional and modern Italian dishes were nicely executed, and service was terrific. The salmon tatare with scallops and caviar, and the risotto with red prawns I had were really fresh and flavorful. It was good, but not really anything spectacular that would make me want to order it again. Scallops were a tad well done, and the risotto was slightly too gooey for my preference. The service was excellent throughout, and the servers were always smiling very warmly. The decor and interiors of the restaurant however, was rather dated and looks tired. Overall, a great dining experience

This little gem Italian hideaway from the hustle and bustle of Singapore turned out to be a welcome retreat. Seated in their outside terrace was a true getaway! Some very traditional dishes on the menu, yet the freshness and quality of their produce is outstanding. My guests enjoyed handmade pasta dishes, while I enjoyed a simple fish meal. Their tiramisu was superb - and always a good test for an Italian restaurant! Excellent overall quality. The waitstaff were efficient, warm and knowledgable. Sometimes a rarity in this city. I'll be back
5
Elegant setting, attentive service, simple yet flavoursome food. We were there for a business lunch and for the quality of food and customer service, it was well worth the money. Will be back.

This is a fine dining restaurant where you can get combo of nice place, good food and good service without breaking your bank. The look is a bit intimidating from outside which probably makes it not too popular despite what mentioned above.
3
Nice décor - a Spanish patio in the middle. Food was good and staff is very friendly. Interesting experience as one does not feel to be in Singapore. Romantic
5
Great variety! We enjoyed the full buffet line, and the ala carte items. The soup, and ravioli were especially memorable. Awesome service as always, this time we made reservations late so we were seated further from the buffet line. Please call in early!
4
I have actually been a couple of times. Sense is everything a good restaurant should be. Spotlessly clean, attentive, but not intrusive service, with a good ambiance, food and wine list.Please do try it, it's not the cheapest in town but it is a good restaurant
5
Warm welcome received upon entry. Was led into indoor dining area by concierge lady. Decor was colonial for outdoor dining but exquisite looking on the indoor part. Service at all times was attentive yet unobtrusive. Kudos to the team!Had scallop fennel soup and duck liver risotto as starters which both were noteworthy and tasted delicious. Truly authentic. Ordered cod fillet and angel hair pasta as mains and certainly not disappointed. Liked the dessert tiramisu as well. Overall best experience which explained the coveted title of 2015/2016 best business lunch restaurant in Singapore
5
I have now been to Senso on a few occasions. I have never been disappointed. i find the menu has a great selection, the service is excellent, the food is of a high quality & I feel very well priced. There are far more expensive places in Singapore that live up to the experience here

I arranged a dinner for the CEO of our company coming from Denmark together with the whole team based in Singapore. The restaurant had been chosen based on recommendation of a friend. Everyone was happy with the food served and the service. This was extra class. Our CEO requested to do the Christmas dinner in December when he is coming again in this restaurant. Full 5 points out of 
5
We had a business lunch at Senso. The restaurant found us a discreet corner. We ordered a bunch of starters and a main each. And the sommelier helped us pick a wine that would go with the food. All excellent. It's a bit pricey but worth every cent.
4
We visited Senso for Sunday brunch. We had booked a table outside on the terrace, thankfully; the inside restaurant was dark, cramped and depressing. The food was generally good: starters OK - not a huge choice - and mains served in very small helpings but good quality, except the cod which was completely dried up. Steak lovely. Desserts - OK-la. Nice choice of wines. I don't like bubbles-only brunches but Senso offered red and white wines too - full marks. The service started off well but went downhill as the lunch progressed. Difficult to get plates cleared, wine served etc. The biggest negative was that the tablecloth on arrival was DIRTY. The manager had either not noticed or did not feel it necessary to change it. I asked for it to be changed, which I felt was met with surprise. A new tablecloth was put on - actually still dirty. I would not rush back when there are better options available in Singapore. Overall, enjoyable but service needs to be improved and please provide clean, white, ironed tablecloths. This is a prerequisite for any quality restaurant
5
Very attentive service by the waiter and waitress there. Food served has good portion. Will go again soon.
4
fThe first impression was great when we enter through the reception. was greeted with a warm greeting from the managers and was brought to our seat in restaraunt. whats interesting was the restaraunt was divided into a balcony area which is quite romantic for two and an inside area for more formal meals. Service was great, food was exceptional, though is a bit pricey but worth the foo there
5
Cosy bar area for pre-dinner drinks. Service at the bar a little slow. Restaurant and setting in beautiful courtside area was superb. This was our second visit. Whether seated inside or outside does not detract from the excellent service which is also well timed. The food was delicious and certainly no complaints from our table
5
Went here for a dinner with ex colleagues and was really happy with the service and FOOD. Can't believe how this gem that's just a few blocks away from my workplace has been under my radar for a while! Price I must say is a bit more of the mid range, but with topnotch food quality and impeccable service, I'm not complaining at all

We arrived on time, for a dinner reservation for 4 on a Saturday to a very crowded reception - another party of 4 was dealing with the Maitre D' as their reservation, through the Hungry Go Where app, was seemingly lost.This didn't bode well for us since we had booked through Chope...After a few minutes he motioned them towards the bar and assured us that our reservation was in the system - a table indoors for 4 at 8.30pm... He promptly ran off to help a waiter bring a table from storage and set-it up in the middle of the courtyard, gingerly waiving around the other patrons.He came back sweating profusely and when we asked him to confirm our table was indoors, as booked, he looked at his system, looked at us and then said "oh, yes, indoors"... clearly the booking had been ignored and off he went to look for another table... He also complained of the restaurant using too many different booking apps, not synchronized to the system, thus creating confusion.As we voiced our unhappiness at the delay and lack of organization, his tone and demeanor also changed very quickly - he became quite curt and frankly unpleasant.After about 15 minutes, we were ushered to a table which had quite obviously been set-up in the last few minutes, bang in the middle of a narrow passageway. We spent the rest of the evening with waiters bumping into our chairs as they walked past continuously to go to the larger dining room.Once seated, the staff did a much better job aside from the sommelier - when we asked him about a particular wine, of which a single varietal was present, his response was "we only have one type so it must be the best"... he then suggested another wine and after just a few comments from us that this could be worth a try, simply walked away, seemingly to indicate that the choice was made. Brusque at best.On the food? Good, nothing incredible.However, to have to wait because this restaurant cannot handle the multiple booking systems it has elected to use; to then be faced with rude and unprofessional staff and overall to feel rather unwelcome will ensure we never return and indeed, actively discourage friends and acquaintances to patronize this place

Food. ok. Price for food, ok. But the service of the chap who waited on us, HORRIBLE!We had a business lunch at Senso today. Upon arrival, we were greeted and showed to our table. All very well and appreciated. Handed the menu, filled our glassed with water without having to ask for them. All was well. Then we thought we needed some help on our order. The waiter came by. Armed with his order pad, he's all ready to take in order but we asked about some items on the menu. He quickly answer them and asked "And your order, sir?" When told we need more time to decide, he turned away saying "OK, I'll come back when U're ready". We sensed that it was a little impatient. But it wasn't particularly busy yet.One of our friend is lactose intolerance. Hence, the need to clarify if there's milk in his order. We waived for someone to clarify and take our order. The same waiter came. "U ready to order?" "Can I know if there's milk in this pumpkin soup?""Cream is used to make such soup." Sounding like pointing an obvious in his tone."So there's milk then?""There's cream. And you use milk to make cream."We were surprised with such response. Is that how a service staff in such any restaurant suppose to respond to questions?"Oh, I see that you are still not ready. I'll come by again when you are finally ready to order." He turned around and left us speechless. If it had been a lunch with family or friends, we would have just paid for the water and left! It's with a client and had thought we'd spare the inconvenience of finding another place and not dwell into the awkwardness of the situation.We were utterly disgusted with the experience and we'd NEVER step in this restaurant again. Neither would we recommend. In fact, we would surely suggest an alternative if SENSO is ever brought up as a dining venue among friends, business associates

There's something truly wonderful about very experienced maitre d's who know just how to make sure their guests' needs are taken care of without it feeling like you are being interrupted when having dinner with that special someone in your life. You just can't beat exceptional quality and service and this is certainly one place in Singapore that offers that very best level of service. There are many excellent Italian restaurants in Singapore, with excellent food and wines, but this one is hard to beat for service, ambience - the complete package.

Went for Sunday brunch, lovely restaurant with sufficient selection of starters and prompt top up of prosecco.Main course and pasta is average at best, quite tasteless and below expectation. The menu changes weekly so maybe other weeks are better..Overall was ok, I may visit again for the starters + prosecco or ala cart
5
Thank you Senso for a really lovely evening ~ I visited last night with a good friend and you totally came up to the mark! From the delicious bread, olive oil and olives to a sensational beetroot and goats cheese salad to a perfectly cooked piece of Sea Bream. The service was delightful ~ a lovely Filipino guy ~ We were having such a good time that we ended up in the bar and I had an affogado. At no time were we made to feel uncomfortable even though we were the last to leave! Will definitely be back ~ please keep up the great effort
5
I had decided to go to Senso on the suggestion of a Singaporean colleague. I also like it when restaurants have easily navigable websites and post their menus online. I had emailed the restaurant to coordinate as we were a large group of 16, of which 12 of us were out-of-towners, for a birthday celebration. The service was very professional and attentive. They were extremely prompt in their email replies and gave some suggestions (e.g. birthday cake) for our group. At the restaurant, they were attentive to our needs as we had baby buggies and a child. They served everyone at the same time, even when some of our guests had arrived late and ordered later than everyone else. Food was excellent, all 16 of us agreed. Price was as expected for the location and ambiance
3
We selected this restaurant after reading reviews on TA. Had high expectations but found service quite slow. Wines are overpriced. Food was average.
5
Great place. We come once a year and every time we do, we always leave with happy bellies! Can't wait to come again next year!
5
Anytime we go and eat in Senso we are always treated as Kings, they always try to accomodate us as the best they can, and the outome is always positive. The food is very good and fresh, as well as perfectly served.
5
Went to this restaurant with family. The whole atmosphere,decor and surroundings were pleasing. Food was outstanding and so was the wine. Very attentive staff,but we were not hassled! A very memorable meal. Not cheap,but my son was paying.

It was a lovely dinner with friends, good food and excellent service. The restaurant is set within a couple of old houses/shophouses, with a lovely courtyard in the middle for alfresco dining, as well as a large air-conditioned area in the back.Foodwise, the scores were pretty high among us diners for most of the dishes. The carpaccio di manzo was sliced thinly and dressed nicely, while the gnocchi was cooked just right. Most of us went for the 8-hour braised beef cheek and it was so tender and flavourful. The roasted sea bass fillet was also fresh, firm and tasty. The dessert trio of panna cotta in capuccino, vanilla and strawberry, and chocolate was a nice and fitting end to an excellent meal.The only weak items were the tea and coffee which came with dessert.Service was excellent and the meal was well paced. I am sure they had another sitting but our table of six never felt rushed to leave
4
We were very happy with attention of the staff, especially impressed by the sommelier who proposed and offered an excellent mint-honey-tea when he realised that my wife didn't feel very well.The fish (Cod) was cooked to perfection. The Osso-Bucco and polenta had a very fine taste. We appreciated the choice of excellent wines served by the glass.Senso is definitely worth it's price.We will come bac
4
Very good value if you have the Entertainer App as it works out to be just 60$ per person. Have to make reservations in advance if it is during peak season (eg Christmas, New Year and Valentine's). The portions for the mains are quite big and they don't serve tasting portions so be sure not to over order
1
Ambiance was nice but that's the only thing nice about the place. Food was so-so and not worth the money you pay for. Staff were nice but the chef was a little bit weird. He was going around talking to people but he only chooses the people he will talk to. There are better places to throw your money around Singapore and this place is definitely not one of them.
1
Won't recommend this restaurant. The food was not fresh at all. We had beef carpaccio as entre and had diarrhea and fever the next day. The doctor said was food poisoning. We found a fly in the wine glass, and the waiter seemed used to it and said it happens sometimes, not sincere at all. The restaurant manager was ok, he came to apologize as we were really pissed off by their attitude
5
Parking just outside the huge car park on Club Street was easy after 5.30pm since most working class would be leaving. If that fails, Senso offers Valet service and they can even send you home if you're over the drink-driving limit! Setting in this restaurant is cosy with alfresco and in-door air-conditioned dining. All the service staff are male for some reason but they were extremely hospitable.Our waiter took the time to explain the menu since most dishes are described in Italian. We settled for a sparkling water and a 3 course set dinner. The starter of raw Wagyu beef was simply tantalizing! The main course that followed was even more mouth-watering. Angus beef grilled to perfection. The thick and succulent beef oozes freshness when chewed into. It was one of the better steak I've tried thus far. The final molten chocolate with a scoop of Vanilla competed the evening and set us back by $285 for a rare but delightful evening! If anything, I would say the excellent customer service & tasty Italian menu nail it for Senso
4
We went this restaurant to celebrate my friend's birthday. Great food and good service. The restaurant staffs sang a wonderful birthday song to my friend.
5
We ate lunch with friends and so enjoyed the wine, the appetizer and main course of Sea Bass, and Lasagna with lobster. All was great and good service as well.
5
Went for a valentines dinner and the staff accommodated to out wishes and provided superb service. Really nice food and good wine selection
5
Revisited Senso for lunch again. Service and food was very good! Waiters were attentive and friendly.
4
Service and food was good. My clients loved it and would definitely bring my future clients there. Thank you!
5
So gooood... we been here last year for dinner and last night again. Still very good food, excellent service and great wine list. Some wine very expensive but others very fair. I'm surprised to find the great wine "Luce" for fair price. Also the owner came to the table to serving the wine and explain all about Frescobaldi. Btw he could still remember me after 1 year as i was there many times before. We will be back for romantic dinner:-
5
Hd a lunch date with my wife there yesterday. Booking was easy & restaurant called to ascertain indoor or outdoor seating. We had the caprese salad with Buffalo milk mozzarella with tomato & Basil, which was a perfect combination! Delicious! We also had the signature Papardelle w Wild boar ragout & the Sea bass pancetta which were both very good & done just right! Dessert was not bad(Italian Piedmont) , but the coffee was great! Service staff were attentive & polite. And ambience was conducive for dates or a business lunch/dina. We used the palate card which was value for $$. Overall 2 thumbs up!
3
Food is good and expectations of the pricing per meal was understood - this is fine dining territory. We also ordered a few drinks - striaght Vodka's. One round completed for 3 persons and the waiter - dutifully - asked us if we wished a second round - "next round were to be doubles?". The bill came and we gave a card to complete the payment. The waiter returned with the bill for signature and card but the amount had changed - increased. Explanation was he had not charged us for the full price of double shots for our drinks. An extra $120 later. we were left wondering if in fact the "mistake" was a real error - did we really get double shots? We will never really know and it makes me less trusting of the place..
2
Food excellent but service was lacking. Left in the bar for 25 minutes with no service. We had to go and find assistance. Sat in the courtyards lovely experience until 2 tables started smoking cigars. We had to leave due to smoke. We have been to Senso several times and always recommended it but no more, sorely disappointed!!

I booked about a week in advance for an early afternoon meal on Valentines day with my wife. Booking was just done normally through their site. During the afternoon on the day before Valentines day I get a call to confirm my booking. Seemed fine till they told me there would be a set menu and no normal or other menus to choose from. This information wasn't available or given at the time of booking. So I asked for them to send over the details for me to check out. To my shock there was a $148++ per person price that included one drink and no option to actually choose the food we wanted to eat. What? To put that in perspective, they offer free flow bottomless brunch at $98++.Now I understand the hiked prices and set menus on Valentines day. That's fine. But the way they keep quiet about it when you book and then spring it on you the afternoon before, giving you no choice whatsoever, since it's now too late to get another booking - this is a cheap nasty piece of profiteering that belongs in the gutter. Needless to say, we didn't proceed with the booking on sheer principle. There should be no room for these sorts of deceptive bully tactics with any restaurant, let alone one claiming to be classy. A shame, because my past experiences with Senso weren't too bad
2
Nice place, good food, very expensive. Good menu selection but I wouldn't be excited about going there again.
5
Incredible ambience, service and a fantastic experience all around. Fantastic Italian food, attentive staff and great service. A classy affair
4
Senso always has had great service and is an excellent place to bring clients for dinner or lunch. The sommelier is stand out and timing of service is excellent.
Definitely worth visiting. Food portions are on the lighter side but that's fine dining for you.
4
Our first time in this restaurant. Price slight expensive but worth it as the quality of food is very good. Service is good with nice bar. Cocktail selection is great. Location is good with ample parking space.
4
Love the food, wine and ambiance at this place. Great options and cooked with a whole lot of flavour. Always have got service with a smile which sometimes can be a rarity in singapore.
4
Loved the ambience of the restaurant. Service staff were extremely attentive and friendly. The taglierini I had was done perfectly. Not overly seasoned so you can still taste the freshness of the ingredients. Value for money if you make use of the entertainer app one for one vouchers

I booked a restaurant for a surprise Christmas Eve dinner with my partner and it was not a bad choice. We rocked up slightly late. They kept our table still and nice to allowed us to change to outdoor area (we both didn't want to sit in the a/c area because my partner and I fall sick together just a day before) Anyway, tho it's a fixed festive menu on Christmas Eve but it was decent combination and worth the price tag. They were generous with the portions (which somewhat to a small eater like us we full since the second course, ravioli cream source).We asked to change the granita because it's served in almost liquid form (made me think of margarita that complete melted) The veal was cook in perfection, tasty and nice presentation, only no one ask us how we would like the beef to be done. We figured that it's a one done-ness service since its needed to be cook for huge number, but still - to me it will be more personalize if I was asked.Vanilla ice-cream for Dessert was a good quality, you could feel the vanilla pot in it but We were full when dessert was served perhaps so we found it too much for dessert - a scoop of vanilla ice-cream on panettone bread. Over all it's worth the price for food quality, taste and Romaric ambiance just complete it all.
5
We went to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday to Senso for a Sunday Prosecco brunch as we heard a lot of good reviews about it. And we were definitely not the only ones as the restaurant was full so that the staff needed to look for extra chairs for guests. Even though the expectations had already been set high they could meet or even exceed them. We were late for the appointment so our table had been released but the hostess was calm and helpful and found another table after a short while.The staff was very attentive and efficient. They even prepared a surprise dessert for the Birthday boy though I hadn't requested it.The buffet spread was amazing offering options for any taste. Incredible value for money with all those cold cuts, cheeses, seafood etcIt was a good idea of theirs to have the main courses served in small portions so we could try different ones without stuffing ourselves or wasting too much food. It was a great dining experience in a beautiful and elegant setting. Compliments to the Chefs and the Service team
4
I used to come here quite often 10 to 15 years ago, but somehow it fell off my radar. So i was pleasantly surprised to see how well they've maintained the quality of food, decor and service. On top of that, they have a great lunch special that's hard to beat in terms of value for money. While quiet from the inside, it was nearly full on a Wednesday for lunch. There's also a nice courtyard for cigars and after lunch drinks. I will be back to check out the rest of the menu. Oh, and they also have some decent wine for under 100 which is nice
5
My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at Senso last night and had a beautiful evening. As part of our celebration, we were given a welcome drink on arrival which was a lovely touch and also at dessert they presented us with a gorgeous platter with tiramisu and the words happy anniversary drizzled in chocolate. The service was excellent and contributed to a wonderful dining experience. We will definitely return
5
Be hungry first cause you're going to eat a lot!
The location is charming! Choose the patio that is in a colonial atmosphere. Their homemade gnocchis with gorgonzola, OMG I will remember them for a long time!
3
Pasta dish was dry and not tasty at all. Slow service as we sat so long before they even served as bread basket.
5
My sister and I came for the Sunday prosecco brunch and we were not disappointed. As well as the usual buffet cheeses, meats, desserts etc., Senso also offers a menu with appetisers, pasta dishes, mains and dessert included in the price. It's a nice difference to the usual Sunday buffet brunches. Other than the great food, I must commend the staff. Singapore is known for bad service but the staff at Senso gave the best service I have had in Singapore. It's one of the reasons I will be coming back.
5
From the professional follow up to confirm our reservation, to the welcome and friendliness of the staff - the scene was set for a special evening. Not one moment of disappointment throughout our experience. The food sublime - kudos to the Chef. The service - wonderful and refreshing to have people who are knowledgeable and engaged in their respective roles. The atmosphere was perfect and the wine list fabulous. All different patrons so no fixed "type" of diners. I think we have found our new culinary home: bellissimo!!
5
I can not even emphasise how delighted we are about the outstanding service rendered by everyone at the restaurant. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, we were looked after with so much passion, sincerity and care. It's the best service we ever experienced in Singapore and we have lived here for more than 7 years. Food is delicious and plated very well. Served warm bread basket that is enough to feed 4 people not like other restos that typically conserve breads. Grilled lamb chops was cooked perfectly. Congratulations and I hope they will always maintain the excellent standard of service that most businesses in Singapore should learn and emulate from
5
Had dinner with 12 people and the service was great. They timed all of the food perfect so no one was waiting and managed to keep all of us happy. The appetizers of cheese and meats was so good I could have made a meal of it. I had the venison ribeye and it was superb and cooked to perfection. Will definitely be back on my next visit.

Location:We chose this area because we like it quiet yet near to other bar / pubs.Conveniently located near Chinatown / Telok Ayer MRT, ~5min stroll.Food:Check with the staff for seasonal dishes and they would be able to recommend what is nice. Even though they served per portion, the staff offered advise that we can share the dishes between mains and pasta. Food are quite tasty and well presented. Service:The staff and manager will walk around asking patiently if you have any request for them. Manager even whipped out a dessert cake for us secretly after finding out its our wedding anniversary even though i did not make any special arrangement. Surprised : )Observation: From other review, we saw that the dishes get cleared away very fast.We took our time to eat and chat / snap photos, did not encounter this issue.Service did not end after you left the table. Counter staff was very service oriented and even offered to call for a cab if we need to.Dinning Area:You are able to choose between Courtyard (Outdoor) / Main dining area (Indoor).Courtyard offers Al fresco style dining in the open but it may get hot in singapore depending on the weather. We chose indoor seat and was welcomed by soft lights and air conditioned quiet ambient.Tip:Do make reservation a week or 2 before hand. Crowd began to settle in after 7.30pm. Dress code: Smart casual at least
4
It's such a nice place with a beautiful courtyard and high ceilings. Such a lovely ambience. Italian food with course was good and decent but completely forgettable. We had a set lunch. The only problem was that I had one seafood skewer and some vegetables - by 6pm I was hungry again. However my other lunch guests had more substantial food when they chose the beef etc. Service was good - not that anything special happened to me but they were so nice and friendly. It would be something I remember
5
We had already been there a couple of times before, but with the haze in Singapore we now decided to eat indoors. The place was slowly gathering crows after 7:30pm and when we left it was packed. Everything we ate was delicious. Just one small minor point: the zabaglione with mixed berries took almost 45min. to arrive. After 40min. however we received a sorbet with some fruits to apologize for the long wait. I suppose they tried to prepare the zabaglione and it failed so they had to redo it. There were too much berries and not enough zabaglione but still the overall meal was superb. Will definitely go there again. We loved it. Again. It's not cheap though

I went to this quaint Italian restaurant in the club quadrant of Singapore for a business dinner and was quite surprised by the location and ambience. The restaurant is centered around a courtyard with the bar at the entrance. The service was impeccable and the choice of wine very good. I found the menu quite exhaustive. I settled for scallops on the shell for a starter and thereafter New Zealand lamb for the main course. Simply delicious with wait staff who were efficient but not obstrusive. All in all a really good experience. So good that I want to bring my wife there the next time I visit
4
Lovely food and service. This was my second visit and this restaurant is consistent in food, service and atmosphere.
5
Elegant ambiance. excellent service. Great wine list. Top notch service. Food was outstanding. Homemade pasta is very very good.
3
Good follow up on reservation. Fantastic views in a stylish location. Alert - very small portion sizes. Food fine but not outstanding. Attentive staff but a very long time to process the bill.
5
I had lunch at Senso when in Singapore for business. The service was first class and the food was excellent. Very nice atmosphere, comfortable yet upscale. It was easy to carry on a conversation while enjoying great food and great service.
5
The restaurant is beautiful and set around a lovely courtyard. The wait staff are very friendly, helpful and polite and the standard of service is incredibly professional. There is an extensive menu, and everything looks great. I had the pappardelle with boar ragout, which was really delicious, just like you find in Italy and tiramisu to finish - also delicious. Extensive wine list. Moderately expensive, but worth paying for. I highly recommend visiting Senso.
4
Came here as my friend had a one for one main promotion via an app. The last time I was here must have been 10-15 years ago. The place is well maintained over the years, though I find the white lighting too bright for dinner We started with a seafood capellini and it was tasty, though a tad overcooked We had beef tenderloin and roasted quail as mains. The quail was ok, and our medium tenderloin undercookedDessert of molten chocolate cake was goodThey gave us free digestives to apologize for the beef3.5 stars for the food, add 1/2 star for the complimentary grappa and limoncello
4
The indoor atrium like set up creates a lovely relaxing atmosphere. Enough ambient noise to be enjoyable but not overly noisy. Extensive menu options and we were not disappointed, the highlight was the Burrata Pallazo but all dishes lived up to expectation. The wine list was equally as extensive so we had no trouble matching wine with our meal. The waitstaff were very professional and had strong knowledge of the menu. The only real negative was that the service was quite slow and the staff a little inattentive when it was busy

Went on 30 July 2015 for a business dinner. We 3 - Singaporean female and male, and American male - arrived at 5:35pm. Restaurant opens at 6pm, so we sat at a table outside the restaurant to wait. The interiors of both the restaurant and bar next door were dark, no activities inside. At 6:02pm, we went to the restaurant door, it was still locked, so I knocked on the glass panel. Seeing no one inside, my Singapore male friend went round the building, entered the restaurant to open the front door for us. Seeing my friend inside the restaurant, the manager rushed in from the back to open the door for the 2 of us still outside. He then proceeded to switch on the lights and aircons. He was silent throughout, no greetings or apology for opening the door late (by then it was past 6:05pm). I wasn't happy and asked if the restaurant was ready, or should we go to another restaurant. I asked twice, before he mumbled "Yes, we are ready". He then led us to the inner dinning room, past the courtyard, walking at least 20 metres ahead of us.The heirloom tomatoes, pasta, dessert and wine were good. The waiters were very attentive and courteous. They know what it takes to run a good restaurant, unlike the manager, who did not appear until our dinner was over. There are a lot of good restaurants in Singapore serving excellent food and wine. The cutting edge for a restaurant then is the service. With the manager's arrogant and indifferent attitude, I'll not return to this restaurant

It had been some years since returning to Senso, having eaten there in the past several times. I had some concerns it may have changed, I was not disappointed. Firstly the greeting by the staff was extremely welcoming. The atmosphere in the restaurant and the decor, really added to the pleasure of the evening. We were 12 people and all the dishes came out on time and the quality if the presentation was good. The food itself was good, although their speciality lasagne I found a little dry, but still enjoyable. Definitely on my list for a return visit again.

Great space with indoor and al fresco terrace seating options. Tasteful decor. Evening diners were a mix of work functions and couples. It was pleasingly busy and good ambience but we still had a secluded space to ourselves.Food was top notch. We started with Prosecco and antipasto. Palma ham and mozzarella was lovely. I love pasta but I often find I'm left disappointed.... Fortunately not tonight - seafood linguini with spicy Sardinian sauce was fantastic. Girlfriend loved her lobster and squid ink tagliatelle. Great wine selection, even by the glass.Attentive and helpful staff. We had a small mix up with our water that was quickly resolved without fuss and not charged.Overall good value also for such a great meal and evening. 2 pax each with 3 courses and 2 glasses of wine for $200. Will visit again

fantastic food, great wine list and maybe the best service in town ... you feel welcome and taken well care of the min you step through the door ... nothing else to add! :)
5
One of the best Sunday Brunches available in Singapore. Starters and desserts were buffet style but mains were selected from a menu. All food was excellent and the service was warm, friendly and attentive. A very definite recommendation.
5
My husband's work colleague said she was taking us to a restaurant near Chinatown and we got all excited thinking that we would
4
Not the cheapest place in town but the food is worth it. The tuna is excellent don't miss it. ? service also excellent.
5
The lunch set menu offers a great value for what Senso offers. The food are prepared perfectly and the portion is also quite well managed. The atmosphere is very decent and again makes you feel very comfortable. The staff are well trained and also very professional. The private room for dinner or special ocassion is also very good
4
We went there with friends on a Saturday night. The waiters are very professional and can give good advise for food and wine. I tried the Pappadelle XXlong and the bobby veal rack, it was really good and the Amarone was excellent.We will definitely go back
4
Setting:Close to Chinatown. Very nice arriving space and bar with nice appetizers. You have an option to have a private dinner in a room, where you can see the wine cellar through a glass door. Other option is an outside patio - which could be very hot and humid.Food:Very nice grossing and crostini choices. I also tried the shrimp carpaccio - well, I believe a local creation. As a main dish I choose the Tillmann seafood platter. The seafood was overdone, so that I had chewy scallops. The visual presentation was nice. Tiramisu was outstanding.I would return, if I have Italian nostalgic moments
4
We dined at Senso a number of times with small and large groups of friends. The traditional terraced house setting is a nice break from the uninspiring and uninviting mall or large office building type venue for restaurants in Singapore. In the entrance foyer, the comfortable bar area on the right offers a nice welcome for guests to enjoy a pre-dinner drink or a "bubbly" before the meal and the courtyard which you have to pass through to reach the main dining are offers a pleasant outdoor environment to finish off the night with a good cigar and coffee if you wish to do so. For large groups they have also a nice cellar style private function room which I would recommend. The food was generally always OK and thanks to the regular updates to their menu, we could always find something new to try. Do they have an outstanding signature dish? The honest answer is probably "not really", but they do everything on the menu to a decent standard, serve it well and make you enjoy the experience and feel comfortable all the way. There is also a good selection of good wine. Staff is generally courteous, friendly and helpful. If you cannot be bothered to look for parking space in the open-air carpark just on the other side of the road from the restaurant, there is also a valet parking service to help on the doorsteps

I dined here a few times since 2008, and I haven't been back since 2013. The service was TERRIBLE and when I gave the manager feedback, he was ambivalent. This place is not getting any more popular even though it was one of the pioneer restaurants on Club St. Do not recommend
5
Senso serves excellent Italian food in a pleasant, sophisticated ambiance. The service is warm and attentive. The taste, quality and presentation of the food is a delight. Prices are high, but portions are also big. There's both inside and outside (in a patio) seating available. For a special night out, can fully recommend this place. We'll be back
4
The food, service, and ambiance is great !
The sommelier went out of his way to take us on a wonderful wine tasting journey.
The waiters displayed old fashion fine dining attentive service.
We want to come back and bring our friends.

We hosted some clients at Senso for a dinner and the overall experience was a very good one. It is an elegant setting, with a very welcoming reception area and nice bar area off to the side for welcome/waiting drinks. The waiting staff all appear to be professional and experienced and our table attendant was very good. I had the steamed white & green asparagus (seasonal on the white asparagus) with appropriate trimmings and sauces and it was lovely. I then had the 8 hour braised beef cheek with mashed potato (Senso Puree) and it was sensational. The tiramisu was so light and tasty that one was really tempted to take more.... and then the espresso to finish a great dinner. I cannot say enough. PS:The red wine was also super but I cannot remember the name. Sorry. It's probably quite pricey for Italian but for a special night out I think this is a great place to be
3
I went here recently for an office lunch - I was a bit disappointed by it. I had a caprese salad which was nicely presented but the tomatoes were underripe and the mozarella, which claimed to be buffala, had none of the texture or softness of texture you would expect. My main course was pappardelle with a wild boar sauce. The pappardelle were stuck together, so presumably reheated after being cooked earlier and the sauce was OK but acidic, as if they hadn't cooked out the wine properly or had added vinegar. Despite the fancy surroundings and the high levels of service, the food was no better than average
4
On a warm balmy night after a cocktail at 1-Altitude overlooking the Island City State, my friend and I made our way to Club Street and the elegant Senso, tucked away in a restored heritage building.We chose to sit inside in air-conditioned comfort rather than in the attractive outdoor courtyard.The staff were impeccable and attentive.The food was a delight in that classic, simple, Italian way - simple cooking rich with flavour.The amusing bouche was a simple and chilled mouthful of smooth artichoke.This was followed by a shared Buffalo Mozzarella, a traditional Caprese Salad with fresh Buffalo Milk mozzarella, tomato and basil leaves which was both rich with cheese and fresh with fragrant tomatoes.My main dish was a delicious seared Mediterranean Sea Bream fillet, grilled zucchini and sautÃ©ed spinach with lemon confit, olives, tomato and caper marinade - tasting of the garden and the sea with a wonderful freshness.My friend had Australian grain-fed Beef Tenderloin with shallots and Barolo red wine sauce, young Vegetables and Senso puree, with the beef falling apart in your mouth with that sensuous slow-cooked luxurious taste.We shared an excellent 2011 Clemente Vii Chianti Classico, smooth and elegant with a hint of dryness to suit the rich meat and earthy fish marinade.For dolci, we shared a sublime White Ferrero, a white chocolate mousse and hazelnut almond sablee with fior di Latte Ice Cream - decadent, rich and scrumptious.It has been over 2 years since I last visited Senso and it was an excellent return
4
Great restaurant with very nice atmosphere.Outside court yard tables are great for the evening. food was good( Starter was amazing, Mozzarella wrapped in parma ham) main was good but perhaps not my best choice.Very extensive wine list, great service. well worth a visit, its was my second time there and just as happy second time aroun
5
One day late for the real treat but fully satisfied in all regards....Ambience perfect, like in Italy sitting 'outside' in the atrium. enjoying the view under the stars in a lovely cosy atmosphere. Service to the point - friendly, helpful and always present - thanks guys, appreciated this a lot. Food - Italian par excellence with all finesse, talent, taste and style. We loved the whole menu - wagyu carpacchio, gnocchi & tagliarini with black truffles, ossobuco and tenderloin with foie gras. Really good treat and topped with a lovely Ligurian Vermentino - thks as well to the sommelier
4
We have dined here twice over the last few weeks, originally having been taken there by a friend now living locally. On both occasions we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The service and menu exceeded expectations. I don't think I have ever eaten so much black truffle in one go, it being on special offer at the time. The setting on the edge of China Town is particularly charming being housed in a former merchants house. I would just lament the price of wine which is very high compared to normal European restaurant standards however this is the case throughout Singapore. If visiting Singapore then this restaurant is well worth a visit
3
Service was was very good. Nice setting & wine selection. Food wasn't as good as expected but not too bad. From all the reviews I read, I thought the risotto would have been exceptional and it wasn't so was a bit disappointed there. Antipasti ok, beef not bad.It's a bit hard to keep track of sparkling water being poured with a group of 10, so what a shocker it was at the end when we received the bill!!
5
We recently had our team Christmas lunch at Senso. Justin the amazing exec chef created a special menu just for us within our budget & with matched wines. We thoroughly enjoyed the delicious food (I couldn't get over the portions! wow). The sommelier was very informative and I loved he paired an Italian red with the lobster pasta. We had a brilliant afternoon topped off by a divine tiramisu. I think Senso management was very kind to us as we were very loud and could be heard laughing from outside our private room. Thanks again to Justin and the Senso team. I will be definitely be back to indulge in fabulous food
5
It was my second time at Senso. The first one was a cocktail in the open area, followed by a very good dinner, although we were 80+ people for that occasion.This time, our team of 10 had lunch just before Christmas. We really enjoyed the food. As a starter, I took a very nice burrata with a big piece of very fresh mozzarella, and great small tomatos. I followed with lobster pasta, which was just "al dente" with a Boston Red lobster (nice souvenir from when I was eating these at Legal Sea Food in Boston).To finish, I swallowed the Tiramisu in less than 4 minutes: it just melted in my mouth.Forgot to mention the very light red wine (see picture below), which went very well with the pasta. I tried the white wine as well (was it a Pino Grigio?), which went well with the burrata.We got the visit of the Chef, Justin (great work!), who ensured that things went well. I will come back
5
I went to Senso for X-mas lunch with my colleagues.
The food was AWESOME.
All food we had were well-cooked, nicely-plated, super generous portion, and most importantly super yummy!
The service staff were very courteous as well.
I will surely go back again.
4
Brilliant, great service in a nice decor and atmosphere. Food was excellent, we had Osso Bucco and pasta! The service staff was polite and courteous. Overall a very nice evening.
4
We went to Senso for our team holiday meal last week and had the most wonderful time. The food was absolutely delicious (my favourite was the burrata starter) and the portion sizes were such great value. Huge thank you to Justin and the team for making our end of year celebrations so special! Will definitely be going back for a visit soon
4
I went to Senso for lunch and found the food to be delicious and the portions generous. I had the Roasted Cod Fillet which I found to be fresh and cooked just right. The Tiramisu was delicious and I finished it within 10 minutes as I concentrated on just eating and enjoying the taste
5
Excellent Italian fare which while appearing to be classical Italian, definitely had chef's own interpretation. Started with an off-menu antipasto of cured meats, olives and freshly made buffalo mozzarella. Main was a perfect osso buck served with a portion of marrow-filled bone with a perfect polenta. This was the best osso buco I have ever had
4
I had high expectation as Senso has pretty good reviews and I didn't get disappointed. :) This is our first time so we asked the staff to recommend. I went with a glass of champagne, Mediterranean tuna for starter and pasta with lobster meat. And my bf ordered burrata cheese and seafood platter with a glass of chardonnay. The dish was all fresh and taste beautiful. Even if we both were very full, we were ended up ordering desert "chocolate lava cake with fresh fruits" and guess what?! Omg I loved it so much! Actually it was one of the best lava cake I ever had!! The cake was melting in ur mouth but the outside is slightly crunch! And the oozy dark chocolate inside was partying in ur mouth. Lol. All staffs I met were kind and attentive, made my dinner more enjoyable. Thank you!I love to visit this place again soon and I will book the seat in a little court yard. :)

I was with five guests and found it important that they had a good time. The first impression was fine with a round table 'Al fresco' and fortunately the sky stayed clear. But the place was poorly lit and in fact a bit gloomy. We ordered the food and the wine from friendly and attentive waiters who kept our glasses full. The food arrived and that was when the disappointment started. The truffle dishes, much recommended, lacked the deep earthy flavor of truffle. In fact, tasted of nothing at all and it might as well have been sliced potato in my soup. The burrato was served very basic and tasted cheap and average. The mains were a joke, ossobucco boiled to a mash; the crumbed fish is better in a fastfood eatery. Eventually the bill arrived and I looked as cheerful as I could, but decided to share it with you. See the photo

After my failure to secure a table at 2 other very nice restaurants, our old friend called his favourite restaurant - Senso and got a table for 3 immediately. It was my first time there and it was a most enjoyable evening. They had cleverly configured dining areas in a clutch of old shophouses which included a lovely alfresco courtyard dining - so intimately peaceful from the street outside.Truffle season so it's everything with truffles - the wait staff brought a huge white truffle to show and tell at our table & let us have a free whiff of unadulterated truffle aroma. The best combination, according to our friend is the scrambled eggs with truffle shavings which was gone in a gusto. I had to try something different - like the jerusalem artichoke soup with pan seared foie gras & shaved truffle - wonderful flavors!For mains, the Ossobucco was hearty & you had to resist licking up the sauce in the tureen. The ravioli stuffed with braised veal shank and dressed with porcini mushrooms were not as exciting as the ossobucco!The sommelier was very engaging and entertaining and brought out the best red wine from his collection... Big thanks to our old friend for bringing us to Senso..........

Singaporeans love Italian food, but sadly most of the offerings on the island are not very good and lack Italian authenticity (see my review of Amarone - truly awful). Senso however manages to deliver at a reasonably high level. The restaurant is very attractive with a lovely courtyard for al fresco dining if you wish. Like a lot of restaurants the air conditioning is a little too fierce for me so do take a cardigan!I started with the tuna carpaccio which was good although the one I had a couple of nights earlier at Bistecca Tuscan was better. I then followed up with sweetbreads, which were sadly breaded and deep fried but tasted good, finally finishing with the chocolate 'eruption' which was delicious.The staff are efficient and courteous if a little too fast with the courses at times.Why haven't I given it 5 stars, there was just something lacking in the atmosphere, but I'll certainly visit again
4
Had business dinner here. Food and service was good. To make it easier for our group (more than 20 people), a set menu was prepared where dinners choose their own main course. The angel hair pasta I had was great.The dessert available to the set was tiramisu. The staff was considerate enough to infom us that it contained alcohol, these are subsituted (without any fuss) with fruits for those in our group that do not drink
5
It's one of the best experiences I Singapore. I felt I walked into Tuscany and the food is just fabulous. Service is excellent and wine collection is elaborate. MUST VISIT in Singapore.
5
Very good selection in the Menu, the taste was real Italian, Good service, and very nice location in Club Street. I really recomend it.
5
Went here for my birthday dinner with my family, and did not regret that. The staff was professional and funny. The food was amazing, and I also got a birthday song and cake. A really good evening!
5
The food was delicious,especially the braised beef cheek. There was a good selection of wines both by the glass and bottles. The service is excellent. We ate in the courtyard and loved the atmosphere.
3
By this I mean inside the restaurant. Whilst the food was excellent, the atmosphere wasn't great. We were seated in the corner of the courtyard area near the waiters station. This made it quite noisy but to make matters worse, guests from the inner part of the restaurant wanting to use the men's bathroom were constantly squeezing through behind my wife's chair. Finally, one guest relocated from inside the restaurant to the courtyard to smoke a cigar - a great end to our dinner.......So, if you do go to Senso, choose your table carefully.
4
My wife and I had dinner at Senso this evening. We had been meaning to visit for some time now, but finally got around to doing it. It's safe to say we were not disappointed. The interior of the restaurant was spacious and well-decorated. Tables were nicely spaced apart which makes it great for couples wishing for some privacy. Nonetheless, the place was warm and buzzing - always a promising sign of a good restaurant. Service was relatively prompt and friendly.We had the Jerusalem Artichoke soup with white truffles and a pan-seared foie gras for starters. We found the portions to be slightly on the small side. However, the pastas - a homemade spinach fettuccine and taglieri with lobster - more than made up for it with its portion and taste. In particular, the fettuccine was hearty and flavoursome.All in all, it's a great place to visit for date nights, and you can expect competent, well-executed Italian food with warm service
5
Another reviewer described the look of this restaurant "crisp"upon entry. The best I can can come up with is smart and cool. The internal courtyard with white walls and carpentry, while open to the sky, is well serviced by fans and at night is certainly a pleasant dining location even in Singapore's pre wet season humidity. If air conditioning is your want, a high ceiling dining room at the back of the courtyard is very well appointed. There are also several separate function rooms on either side. The first floor all round balcony actually services apartments and business premises where entry is from the balcony. This gives a feeling of the sort of community you get in parts of Italy, as people come and go just above you.The chef, Justin Foo, has just introduced a new menu which has to be called modern Italian. Big bowls of pasta it is not. Justin's training is Swiss and this shows in the quality of presentation and the attention by the staff to detail. This, blended with his obvious passion for the original delivered a truly memorable experience. If you do nothing more, try the "Cooked and raw forest mushroom salad" as a starter and think about the coffee and vanilla cream brûlée pair at the end.The sommelier is extremely knowledgable and friendly, as is the floor manager, Tu. A delightful and rewarding meal

Haven't dined here for a few years and with a birthday celebration, decided to re-visit instead of OSO which had become our fave Italian in Singapore.Set in a lovely white lowrise on Club street with an open air courtyard, it should be an atmospheric experience.10/10 for my king Tiger Prawn tomato and orange appetiser, but it went downhill from there. All the mains served were overpoweringly salty, from the veal shank and porcini mushroom ravioli, to Australian beef tenderloin to the risotto and saffron. The latter was very buttery with a generous portion of duck liver! I'm relieved we requested the mashed potato and Barolo red wine sauce to be serviced separately ( don't know if they do it as a matter of course) as the sauce would be have totally smothered the steak.We all resorted to sorbets for desserts to try to calm down our taste buds! An unexciting slice of tiramisu with candle was then presented to hubby on the occasion of his birthday.Including soft drinks, 4 glasses of wine, total bill for 3 came to $350, not unreasonable. But I think this restaurant has lost its finesse and touch. Pleasant service and nothing that you can fault, but a little robotic without genuine charm. Maybe a few years more before we test again.
5
Entering off the busy club street you are transported into calm and quite comfort. Crisp, contrasting deco sets the scene for a lovely dining experience. An extensive wine and food menu make choices difficult because it all looks so good. We enjoys the seafood bisque, Parma ham and mozzarella and tuna carpaccio starters which were all superb all be it the tuna, whilst fresh and refreshing was a little bland. All our mains of slow braised beef cheek with creamy polenta and squid ink past with seafood were outstanding. There is a limited desert menu but be warned, the duo of panacota is not two dainty portion! We had two and the three of us couldn't finish them. They were however delicious. Oh, and don't fill up on the wide ranging bread basket at the start of the meal, tempting as it may be. Try the martinis on offer as well. The service was good but we would have liked empty plates to be cleared a little quicker. Cost: S$ 360 for three with four drinks and tip
5
The name and reputation of the restaurant gives you the impression that it is highly expensive and good quality. While it is expensive in general, it is notch cheaper compared to other Italian restaurants in hotels and marina sands. However when it comes to the quality, they offers food quality that is perhaps in my opinion of the top few in Singapore.Went with a group of friends, we are pleased with the service they provided. The servers offer good advice to us and shows that they are quite well trained. Most of the homemade pasta are good and I would recommend the Taglierini and pappardelle. The abundance of tomato flavor with a good mix of olive oil brings out the best of their pasta.Their fish and mozzarella salad deserve mention too. While I am not a big fan of desserts, I was persuaded to try the chocolate layer cake which I think was very alittle too sweet for me. Nonetheless, that does not take away the credit of a very smooth and pleasant taste of the cake. Definitely I will return to try their gnocchi and risotto.
5
A great time with personal service and great food and wine. Would definitely go again once I get back

For a birthday of our friend we booked a table at Senso. I love the atmosphere of this place with a cozy bar, charming courtyard and elegant yet easy dining room. Chef Jean-Marie Merret made our dining experience unforgettable - the slowly cooked beef-cheeks were tender, juicy and tasty with the right amount of the sauce, the Tuscan soup with beens, pancetta and vegetables was like from Italian mamma! My favorite was pasta with tomatoes and burrata cheese - so simple yet so sophisticated! The taste of the perfectly balanced sauce with the burrata was something I will be coming back for! The staff serving our meals was professional and discreet. Good wine recommendation on the top and kind visit of the chef to our table added to the perfection of our celebration. Thank you chef and the team. We will be back
5
I visited senso last night with my boyfriend and had a lovely time. The service was the best i have had in singapore. They brought a basket of bread to the table and carpaccio to start us off. We ordered a bottle of wine, the rack of lamb and rack of veal. Food and wine were both amazing. Staff were very attentive and friendly, wine glasses were always refilled and my water was never empty. The decor was very nice and at times felt like i was actually in italy. Highly recommend this restaurant and will be returning
5
premise - plush and class.location - with a bigger open carpark just directly opposite the resto, you may get a lot, otherwise just a walk away are 2 building with sheltered car parks.staff - feel like a million dollars going in. feel like a million dollars going out. polite and well trained, everything that you'd expect from a fine dining resto.crowd - was here during lunch and so it was filled with business people.food - ahhh here comes the food, you might think that it is going to cost you and arm and a leg, but NO.... the Executive lunch set was very affordable by the standards of such a place and that's what I had. every bite was an experience on its own.verdict - come here for business lunch, drink a wine or 2, close the deal and go back to the office. Go straight to your boss and say: we dined at Senso, here is the PO signed by the client by the way
5
This was a great surprise following a recommendation of friends. Cuisine is based on authentic traditional Italian food, simple but exceptionally executed, and with first quality raw material. We had dinner in the internal charming patio, outside, in the court. There are also internal place with aircon. Very nice place.Last but not least, quality of service was great.No doubt we will return, this was a very good experience and I can only strongly recommend to try it
4
A friend suggested this unassuming Italian restaurant for dinner. It is a fine Italian restaurant in a modern style within a Singaporean shophouse structure. The service and food are very good and is fine dining with prices to match but is worth it for a special occasion or business entertainment
5
Senso remains one of our all time favourites in Singapore, from the incredible authentic Italian food to the beautiful patio, weâ€™ve organised birthdays, farewells and private parties to opera singing dinners with friends and each time we all had a blast! On every visit the staff have been attentive and accommodating- Najib the somelier is spot on with his suggestions while Tu the assistant manager is always lively and makes us feel at home. The atmosphere is perfect for all occasions, romantic dates for two or big birthday dinners, we always find an excuse to come back
4
We went to Senso for Dinner one weekend and ordered Osso buco and Ravioli for entrees.To be honest, the osso buco was good but my ravioli had a bit of a bite and was a bit dry. The taste was okay but since I was expecting more after reading all the good reviews here,I feel quite disappointed with that, the rest of the food i.e. the starters, the wine, osso buco were pretty good. But the star of the day is the lemon tart. It was the best dessert I have ever had.It was a big portion but it was so delicious that I felt like I could eat two more!!! The pastry chef should be give a medal! I would go back there again just for that. The ambience is nice and the restaurant was nicely decorated. The service is okay, nothing spectacular, as usual in Singapore, it's very difficult to get some waiters' attention.. while others are more attentive and serious about their job
3
Senso has been around for many years and I had not been for many years. I recently went for a work lunch. It was relatively quiet. The decor looks quite dated. However the restaurant is very quiet which makes it a good venue for lunch. I had a 2 course set lunch of fish and cheese platter. The fish was very small so I ended up having to eat a lot of the bread. Overall, this was a good meal but nothing special
5
We hosted a dinner for a total of five people at Senso. The food and service were all excellent. The wine list and selection were superb. The food was served on a timely manner, well presented and delicious. The service team were friendly and polite as well as efficient. We dined inside which was very comfortable
4
It was indeed to have a great lunch
The menu was perfect balanced !
Pasta was had authentic taste good balanced with herbs
Must try !
5
the menu, service and quality are awesome. The manager is very pleasant and charming. The wine list is great but a bit pricy (which is norm in Singapore!).
all in all, a fab night out

For more reviews, visit my website at ms-skinnyfatSenso Ristorante & Bar, Club Street’s favorite Italian restaurant turns 14 this year and i must say it's a feat in our dynamic food scene! To celebrate this milestone, a Best of Senso’s Signatures menu is put together for this occasion. From 1 to 31 July only, sample popular dishes from over the years and also taste exclusive dishes from Senso’s international outlets.The Manzo ($32), Beef Tartare, Roquette & Parmesan, Olive Oil, Chervil and Roasted Potatoes, was a sell-out dish in Crans Montana when it was introduced in 2010. Love the tender and well flavored meat.The menu also features the Sogliola From Mediterranean, Dover Sole Meuniere with Orange Zest, Rucola and Ripened Tomatoes, a special dish from Senso’s outpost in Geneva. Only the Dover Sole is used, the preferred fish for an authentic Sole Meuniere and also the use of oranges from Sicily for that added authenticity.We also had a mini olive oil tasting during the meal and that wonderfully aged (12 years) Balsamic vinegar that tasted like honey. It was amazing with the freshly baked breads.The other dishes are from the Singapore menu. The Green Asparagus and Morels Soup (Singapore 2005) $24 was a light and refined soup, perhaps a little too delicate for my liking.The Risotto (Singapore, 2006) $36, was probably the favorite dish of the night. The salty and creamy risotto paired simply with sweet and succulent grilled tiger prawns. While fresh zucchini flowers from Italy were used in the dish, i found it doing little to complement the already perfect combination. In fact, the fried flowers tasted oily and a little stale.Premium NZ Lamb Rack (Singapore, 2011) $44. The lamb was cooked to perfection with a nice pink center and was good on its own. The olive crust came served as a disk by the side instead and was a little too dry and crumbly.We ended our meal with a deconstructed Tiramisu Revisito (Singapore, 2011) $22. This was specially created by Executive Chef Yves Schmid in 2011. So there's coffee mousse, homemade mascarpone ice-cream with Savoiardi biscotto and coffee milkshake. Good flavors but give me a traditional tiramisu with all that richness anytime.All dishes on the menu are available a la carte, but diners looking for a heartier meal can opt for the three, four or five course menus that start from $88. Wine pairing is also available.The Senso experience was lovely as usual and i really love the atrium section where you get to dine under the stars but in comfort. Great place for a romantic date with your significant other

I visited Senso Restaurant and Bar for a corporate dinner event in their dining room located past the courtyard. We also used the internal courtyard for some pre-dinner drinks and canapes which was great but a little warm, some small fans were being used but they were not string enough however, it had a very nice atmosphere. We had a 4 course dinner with wine which was very nice, excellent quality food and value for money. Service provided was also excellent, I would recommend this venue

Having heard about Senso Ristorante & Bar for a while, I finally made plans to eat there.This authentic Italian restaurant serving classical fine-dining cuisine sits amongst a row of Colonial shophouses and boosts of a sophisticated, elegant interior complete with a long hallway leading to the dining halls.For main courses, there was the Risotto and Hare (SGD$34.00) - traditional Carnaroli risotto with braised saddle of hare, rosemary, juniper berries and butternut pumpkin. I have never eaten hare meat before, hence it was the first time I tried this delicacy - tasted like a cross between pork and quail meat actually. The risotto was not grainy enough in taste (the way I like it, done in French style), but the taste of the overall dish was fabulous, a blend of saccharine with savoury overtures, in a soft porridge-like texture.We also shared the Senso "Bolo"-bster Lasagna (SGD$34.00) - homemade lasagne with fresh lobster meat and tomato sauce. Flavor-wise, there was the hints of lobster sweetness when we bit into the lobster chunks within this baked pasta dish, but the cheese taste was a tad light, unlike the usual lasagne taste. The texture was also non-sticky, and somewhat dry. The crusts were hard, like how Chinese pan-fried carrot cake's ones are like. Once the knife met the lasagne, it crumbled into pieces. It was a little disappointing.Finally, despite us feeling full, we felt that we were entitled to a bit of desserts, so we had the Lemon Tartlet "Big Meringue" (SGD$16.00) to finish off the meal - lemon tartlet stuffed with red berries topped with meringue. We were thankful that the spiral layers of white above the tart was lemon cream (sourish) instead of sweet icing à la the conventional meringues. The tart was crunchy and flaky, and there were raspberries and blueberries hidden in the womb of this meringue tart, making it a welcoming refresher after the heavier courses earlier on.For more detailed information and photos, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/06/dinner-at-senso-ristorante-bar.htm

Visited here last month while visiting my son and his fiancé. Had the Sunday Brunch free flow. Lovely helpful staff service was superb. The range of starters was fantastic, you could almost fill up on the wide choice. The 5 pastas and 5 mains are cooked to order and are mini portions so you could have some of everything. Never had an empty glass. Would recommend and will certainly return on our next visit

My first time in Senso for dinner last Saturday, and for sure not my last one. Our dinner was very enjoyable, for the food but also for the place and service.We choose to seat in the patio, away from the aircon we don’t like. It was nice as they have very quiet fans. The open air patio is very cosy and romantic, make us feel like in Italy.Because our table was not ready yet, although we had reservation, they gently offered a cup of Prosecco, much appreciated and delicious !The staff is very professional, helpful and friendly. Anything we want, they serve you with smile.But let’s talk about food: the menu is wide and it is easy to find something you like, I would say it is more difficult to make a choice as you want to try everything.First they start the dinner with a complementary amuse-bouche, a delicate creme of smoked salmon.Then, we finally decide ourselves to have the seabass tartare, the alla milanese veal rack, the fillet cod with delicious sweet potatoes mash and sautéed mushrooms, the tiramisu and the creme brûlée (vanilla and coffee).They also have a nice choice of wine, especially by glass.Every dish was fresh and delicious, perfectly cooked and served with a basket of different pieces of bread (my favorite: the foccacia with dried tomatoes).In a few words, Senso restaurant is a peaceful place, away from the rush and crowd, to enjoy fine Italian gastronomy. You feel like in Italy during one evening….I definitely want to try their brunch soon

You probably know the form by now .... Appetiser and dessert buffet and you order the main (pasta) dish in between..... Great appetisers .... Didn't get round to the desserts.... We were a large group so busy socialising. The staff needed to be prompted to refill the free flow Prosecco and in the end we asked them just to put a selection of pasta dishes on the table.... Very attractive place though and pleasant locatin in Club St .... Would probably come back with just family to take full advantage. Different prices for kids ... i.e. Under/over 12 .... I overpaid for my son and don't recall being asked his age and didn't see the mistake on the bill because I was wearing contact lenses! There were a couple of seats outside for smokers but you wouldn't want to sit out there all the time as it's practically on the pavement
4
While the selection for Sunday brunch was not extensive, the quality could not be faulted. It was a semi buffet which worked out well. The items on order were pretty good like white asparagus, foie gras, pasta and steak. However, I enjoyed the cold buffet a lot more - just the bread, cheese and cold seafood (oysters & prawns) already made my day though I did enjoy the pasta that was made to order as well. There was a choice of $98 or $129 deal and we opted for the $98 deal as we were not great wine drinkers. Service was attentive and the dining room very pleasant
4
Went with a group of friends so it might be slightly skewed. The place was quite busy -especially the courtyard when we arrived. The people behind the bar were nice and friendly.The food here is Italian so the wines our group leader suggested were also Italian as selected by her. The service wasn't bad.The sommelier was quite competent and knew his cellar well, Nice cellar and a decent Menu.The food quality was not awesome but quite delicious dishes. If you are in teh mood for Italian, this is the place as the wine list is quite extensive and a great choice of Italian wines available
2
This is the second time in 10 days for us with business VIPs. Obviously a restaurant owner whose success went to his head. Arrogant himself, local staff which pretends to be Italians, non attentive service. Nice location and ambience, mediocre food, good wine list.
5
Had lunch and we all ordered lobster lasagna which was an excellent choice. Sitting outside at the veranda was good choice. Service is fine as well.
4
Nice Restaurant good food.. However its massively over priced in my opinion.. Luckily we didn't have a bottle of wine or we would have been washing the dishes as payment!
4
Great restaurant with good food and service, enjoyed the ambiance and the quality of the food, tables were spaced well and you could relax and chill.
2
Restaurant food seems ok, but service staff requires some attention. THey took 15 minutes to take my order, so I had to call one of their waiters / staff walking around. The chap was dressed like the waitstaff (albiet he had a bit more pomp), and expressed how he couldn't take my order, expressing that it was somebody else's job. That's fine and understandable, but was a bit odd to offer such attitude that he was above taking orders, especially considering the gent made it his prerogative to open up a $10 bottle of water, and pour glasses, slipping it into my bill without asking. The food is good, but these sort of shenanigans make this restaurant an incredibly poor choice in value given the choices in SIngapor
5
Brunches around Singapore vary in quality and atmosphere - this is one of the best. From the beginning of our visit, the staff were attentive and not at all stuffy like can happen elsewhere. They contributed towards an atmosphere which was light-hearted and fun. Indeed, by the end of the meal (and lots of prosecco later!) my friend was wearing one of the waiter's tie and various tables were getting photos taken with each other! They even gave us a glass or two after the time was supposedly up. The food was lovely and I liked the balance of having a buffet style selection as well as having food served at the table. A great day out overall. If you are working on Monday then that morning may not be so much fun
2
Not at all!nice ambience, tastefully decorated, convenient location.good quality food, cooking average. Our linguene with sea food were so spicy that could not taste the fish and the shrimp were overcooked. (I'm italian)I chose this restaurant for a business dinner and was expecting at least a good service...I had to remind our waiter three times to bring us a glass of wine..and at the end he brought us the glass already filled with wine... In a fine dining restaurant aren't we supposed to taste the wine first or at least have tha chance to see the bottle of wine??i was very disappointed but more than everything was very embaracced for my guest
5
I arrived expecting the usual good service and food but must say left with my expectations thoroughly exceeded. It was our wedding anniversary and when we noticed petals layed out on the next table, asked if someone else was celebrating their anniversary. When they found out it was also our anniversary, they immediately brought out a stalk of rose and 2 glasses of proseco on the house to go with the bread. We had not ordered alcohol given one of us is breastfeeding and the other a recent gout sufferer but this unexpected gesture was so appreciated we obliged! We could find no fault with the meal and thoroughly enjoyed our soup, appetisers, pastas and dessert. Finally even though we had each ordered a dessert, they served a 3rd order of tiramisu on the house with 'happy anniversary!' scrawled in chocolate on the plate. We were completely won over by this time and agreed to return again in the future

This place has always been a top choice for Sunday brunch as it has a smaller selection of wonderful food, great staff and tasty prosecco. However they have recently decreased the brunch time by an hour 11.30-2.30. In addition to this they removed all the food by 2.10-15 and made it very clear at 2.40 that it was time to leave (they were ironing table cloths next to us, and turned on very harsh lighting).Whilst a couple of the members of staff were very pleasant and professional, the rest looked as if they wanted rid of us the whole time. The hostess didn't acknowledge me for 10mins when I entered the restaurant event though I was the only one there!!! Overall a bad slip in standards for a previously great brunch. Would not recommend now. For the price and selection not worth it. Which is a shame as the food quality is actually very good. So disappointing
5
Love this place for two reason. They got brilliant weekday "business lunch". Fantastically priced lunch menu; perfect treat with colleagues or with client. And the Sunday brunch! Serves prosecco instead of champagne, but it does not slow down the day. Fantastic buffet, ala carte items, and desserts! And because of prosecco, so reasonably priced compared to few other Sunday brunch locations. Top points!(Done dinner with colleagues as well... treat!
5
good place to eat, i went with my friends and we really enjoy our meal at senso. The dessert was awesome, i would like to go back again and again....
2
We made reservation through amex. Charged us 60 dollars for water!!!! They ask you upon arrival if you want still or sparkling and keep serving you without asking!! Very angry! Food average, plates very scarce and expensive for what you get.
5
Visited Senso last night and have to say that the service and quality of the food was outstanding. The portion sizes were very good for fine dining and the flavors were outstanding. Will definitely be going back.
3
Went here with family and nearly fell over with the prices. Very poor value. Charged full price S$20 each for plain pasta ordered for my 2 children! Food was not excellent, only suggest for romantic dinner as the ambiance is quite nice.
4
For the full review please visit http://adventurousbites.com/2013/08/28/senso/.Luxury, excess, decadence – the champagne brunch suits Singapore perfectly. Free flow of premium bubbles and gorgeous mounds of artfully displayed delicacies are an invitation, almost an obligation to indulge. The Prosecco brunch at Senso’s on Club Street has a more measured approach. This enables you to try pretty much everything yet have much less of a food and alcohol hangover. The food overall is well executed making for a solid pan-Italian experience. A lovely brunch - although not quite the celebration the bigger badder brunches are, a great way to spend your Sunday
5
I love Senso, i have been coming to Senso since I first started living in Singapore 4 years ago and everytime I go the quality of the food and the service never wavers in its excellence.The ambience of the courtyard for lunch or especially for romantic evenings is unbeatable. The range of Italian dishes are constant mouth watering and beyond expectation. The range of wines is impressive and the sommelier is a character himself and always welcoming.The front of house is probably the best in Singapore, recognition of previous guests and a welcome smile/surprises is always welcome when settling down for a classic, relaxing Italian meal.Could not recommend Senso more, i go at least once a month and love it! Never let me down whether for business or pleasure

Once you walk in you'll find the cozy courtyard and a spacious and nicely decorated dining room. Floor staff are attentive and very friendly. Great wine recommendation as well. My starter of foie gras was the only good dish of our meal. My wife"s starter of scallops had to be sent back twice and the replacement tiger prawns were also stringy. Halibut main course were 2 thin overcooked and dry fillets,swapped for cod fillet which was just ok. My beef main course with black truffle sauce and gnocchi arrived with red wine sauce and dry cube of oven-baked polenta, which waitstaff still insisted was gnocchi. Didn't bother sending that back as well, as appetite was gone.Don't waste your money there, unless you don't care about what you ea
3
We have been visiting Senso on our annual visit to Singapore over the past 5 years and sorry to say that it's lost the friendly Italian atmosphere that it used to have and has stepped into the realm of a more commercial operation.They still have a large wine selection but somewhat overpriced now even for Singapore
5
My partner & I while visiting from Australia dined at the Senso restaurant. The meal, service & court yard setting was excellent. The selection of wines including knowledge of wineries provided by the senior waiter was well received, even though a little on the expensive side. We certainly recommend the Senso
5
Myself & my boyfriend live in Singapore & wanted to try Senso for a while so when his parents came to visit we decided to book! I'm glad we did as we had a lovely evening. We went on a Monday night so the restaurant was quite quiet & the weather was cooler so we chose to sit outside in the court yard area. We were the only ones there as other guests ate inside but we really enjoyed the area to ourselves! The menu was very hard to choose from which is always a sign of a good restaurant! Small details we enjoyed like a good bread basket & olive oil, friendly & helpful staff, amazing Italian wine, brilliant food, lovely limoncello & truffle chocolates to end the meal complimentary of the restaurant. I had grilled artichoke with truffle purée to start.. Amazing! Then sea bass which was cooked beautifully & a perfect sized portion, the boys had venison which they raved about & I had apple tart to finish which was divine! All very simple but deliciously cooked. I'd recommend it for the brilliant food, very friendly, helpful & chatty staff & a lovely atmosphere. We're considering going here again very soon as we want to work our way through the menu!

Meal was great, wines well paired and enjoyable. Atmosphere was stress free as tables are well spaced and non intusive

The Sunday Prosecco brunch was unfortunately not what we expected. Having had many sunday brunches around the world I would say this is the worst so far for food portions. I well however give the positive and negative side to out Sunday brunch.The staff are excellent they dealt with you from the time of arrival to when you leave the restaurant as true professionals. The brunch which run from 11:30 t0 15:30hrs was good in regards to the drinks with the sparkling wine topped up before you even got to the bottom of the glass. As for the restaurant itself it is a beautiful building and has excellent décor so well done to the management for the design of the restaurant. The court yard area is also very nice.Unfortunately the food was a very big disappointment. The salad bar can only be described as basic and not that interesting in regards to variety. The salad bar could also do with a bit more imagination in regards to presentation as it looked more like a school buffet. Having endured the salad bar, we waited in anticipation of the main courses of the buffet. Wow was I disappointed the main courses are served at the table and the portion sizes are very very small and not what you would normally expect at a brunch. This is the first time I have left a brunch and had to go to McDonalds because I was hungry. Not sure about the restaurant during normal food service in the week it might be very good, but for the Sunday brunch it’s a definite no go for the future

The service is what blew me away at Senso.I had a $100 voucher that had expired. When I called to ask if I could still use it, the staff cheerily asked me how much time I needed and that I could simply come down with them and say I had checked. Phew! I thought they would snub me for using a voucher!I went down 3 weeks later and reminded the maitre d about my voucher and they assured me that I could use it.The restaurant was 80% occupied, with most of the guests asking for refills of wine.Nevertheless, my boyfriend and I were well-looked after, with two service staff constantly glancing at us to check if we needed anything as they hurried around. The waiters were personable and knowledgable when we asked them for recommendations. One even shared stories of how he courted his wife with the restaurant's signature chocolate lava cake.We ordered one bowl of soup, one appetizer, two mains and dessert.The cherry on the top was when the soup and appetizers came separated in two bowls and two plates. The staff had taken the initiative to separate the dishes - with garnishing and decorations - since they knew we were sharing.Such initiative is rare and it truly made our dinner more than just about the food.We will definitely come back again

Have eaten here many times over the years. It is very reliable. Good Italian food and an excellent wine list - difficult to see where they keep such an extensive list. The sommelier is splendid. Hard to go past the scallops to start and the beef cheeks for the main course, but everything I have tried has been top notch.Only downside is the door lady who is meant to be a "meeter and greeter." You are given the impression she is doing you a favour by letting you walk inside the restaurant. Expect eye-rolling and tutting if any requests are made. One of our party wanted a pre-dinner cigarette in the bar and we were told in a very surly manner that the bar was non-smoking. This despite a very large humidor on the bar filled with cigars and the restaurant has a cigar menu. I have seen people smoking in the bar many times. When I stated this I was told, as if I was an imbecile and it is something I should have learned at school, that the bar only becomes a smoking bar after 930pm. Not sure how this works with the law in Singapore - but there we are.The "door lady" presented us with a drinks list as the bar was unmanned at that time - around 730pm. It did not include wine. When I asked for the wine list her reaction suggested this was such a hardship we decided to go elsewhere for pre-dinner drinks. But we returned for dinner which was excellent.Don't let the door lady put you off. The rest of the staff are splendid

Great Italian restaurant. Ordered 2 antipasti. the tuna on eggplant & asparagus I felt was a little sweet, but the scallops were amazing. A huge selection of international wines with a fabulous sommelier - we would go back again just for him. I find the lighting inside a little bright and the aircon a bit cold. It could be more cosy. But all in all, a place worth going back to

Was looking for a nice place to go in Singapore for an anniversay dinner. Narrowed it down to a short list and then decided to give Senso a try.First off, it's location on Club St in the city is very convenient. If you're staying in the CBD it's very quick and easy to get to.The service was fantastic from the outset, and as I'd mentioned it was an anniversary dinner they gave us a quiet and romantic table.The food itself was fantastic - easily as good as some of the better restaurants I've been to in Italy. The Foie Gras and King Prawn entrees were both delicious, and led perfectly to the mains of "Duo of Risotti" and the Quail.Rather than ordering a bottle of wine, we decided to ask their Sommelier to recommend glass wines to match each of the dishes we'd ordered. The recommendations were perfectly matched, and each wine (mostly Italian) was presented with an interesting background story.If you come, be sure to try this, although make sure you specifically ask the Sommelier. We ended up asking for a waiter's recommendation to go with a cheese platter at the end of the meal, but ended up getting a rich Cab Sauv which did not match whatsoever. To their credit, when we mentioned this the Sommelier apologised profusely and immediately brought us a much more appropriate dessert wine replacement.Anyway, I can't speak for the experiences of some of the other less favourable reviews, but we had a wonderful evening; great food, great wine and attentive (but not overbearing) service. Highly recommended if in Singapore and wanting to try a nice alternative to Asian cuisine
5
I have been to Senso many time in the last 6 years, but one of the best qualities of this restaurant is the reliability which this restaurant has been providing. many restaurants are started in Singapore all the time - it is after all an emerging market. But it is astonishing how innovative but reliable Senso responses to this dynamic environment.I lately went for dinner with my wife on a Friday in Summer 2012. I had the Sea-Urchin - Spagetti and a Cod Fish Capaggio and a glass of Pinot Gricho. Everything was excellent
5
Came here for a weekday set lunch and what a great experience it was. Service from the front door to the end was spotless and efficient.Set lunch menu were excellent and priced very reasonablly. The goose liver terine starter was amazing. The great thing about it was the portion; often from a set menu portions were reduced, but here it was generous and excellently plated.Interior is very tastefully kitted out. A very memorable meal
5
Had a weekday lunch here with colleagues and clients. The positives for me were -easy online reservation (it worked perfectly);informative website including detailed menu;greeted warmly at the door, reservation recognised without delay and promptly shown to the table;professional, polite, efficient and non-intrusive waiters e.g. they knew when to back off and not interrupt when we were in conversations;classy but not ostentatious decor;good value executive set lunch (S$38++);the lamb was tender and just right; andcourteous goodbyes when we were leaving.The only downside was that the next table was a big big party of 15 to 20 people who were just making too much noise. If I had requested for a change of table, I think the restaurant would have accommodated us but it would have been too much trouble for us to shift after having settled down comfortably. If you want a quiet setting, be sure to request for it beforehand and ask specifically not to be seated next to big tables.My foreign clients were impressed.This place is definitely a top choice for an excellent lunch experience

After some dark days a year or so ago with an old menu and setting Senso is back better than ever. I used to eat here every week and had not been back for quite a while..was there this week and will start to return..Excellent food with flair, Najib can find you the best wines from great little vineyards, staff knows their business..polished all round place...courtyard is still one of the best places for dinner even on a hot evening!. Must try..Beef cheeks, Sea Bass, Scallops....In the top 3 Italian places now in Singapore...
5
This place is great. We were seated in the courtyard, which was super cozy. Staff was very good and food was excellent.
5
one of the best italian restaurants in singapore!!! do you know that senso means "sensational" !!???!!
5
Great service, good food, good wine and a patio. Recommended!
4
Welcoming staff with an elegant decor. Italian / European cuisine. Highly-recommended.
5
Fabulous Sunday brunch, great service. Nice setting
4
We were here for dinner. There is a nice courtyard with dining tables. For those who prefer to eat outside, they will enjoy sitting in the courtyard. I preferred the air conditioning so I sat in the main dining room, which is nicely decorated.The food is generally pretty good and reasonably priced. We tried the apple pie and lava cake for dessert. They were pretty good too. So save some room for dessert
4
Excellent evening meal shared with friends recently at Senso - great food - wine - Sommelier recommendation was spot on and ambience was wonderful.Service needs work though...could be more attentive to customers' needs i.e. anticipate before it is necessary for customer to ask eg. for more water, etc. Service needs to up its game especially a restaurant of this caliber.Otherwise, a wonderful evening
5
Visited as Singapore celebrates Restaurant Week. The entrée of Buffalo Mozzarella wrapped in Parma Ham which is seared then baked, later served with black olive tapenade and a salad of arugula drizzled with vinaigrette is a meal by itself! The Boston Lobstar Taglierini, which they paired with a Sauvignon Blanc, was delightful. My husband's plat principale, the 8-hr Beef Cheek "Al Cacciatore", which was paired with a glass of Cannonao, melts in the mouth. We skipped the dessert of panna cotta because we were just so full, and had coffee instead. Service is attentive and informative without being bothersome. We will surely come back
1
Unfortunately, Senso wins the award for my worst dining experience ever in Singapore. Here’s a quick summary why…1. Amuse Bouche - i kid you not, they served Cole Slaw as an amuse bouche. COLE SLAW?!?!?2. Bread – served 5 different types of bread rolls, all were dry and obviously not homemade. Why not one type that is actually edible instead of 5 dry types of inedible bread?3. Starter – the $30 Veal Tonnato was a shocker – the veal was dry and tasteless. it basically looked like cheap, processed deli meat. The $30 Parma Ham and Mozzarella starter was equally poor. It was fried instead of served fresh – which killed the taste. It only tasted like oil. 4. Main – my Osso Bucco was a fatty, tasteless blob. When the took it to the chef, he said that was how the served it, but the chef did admit it was “tasteless”. Then why serve it that way? 5. Wine – a complete rip-off – the first wine was Terre di Talamo Vento Vermentino and was S$110, however, online it costs from $10 – 15 per bottle, which means I would expect it to cost $30 – 35 in Singapore. The other, Firriato Chiaramonte, costs under $10 online so I would expect max $30 in Singapore. The markup is ridiculous for poor quality wines. I did complain to the sommelier - who i believe is the owner as well - and he didn't say a word. I think that they were shocked that someone called them out. In summary, incredibly expensive for a VERY poor quality meal. There are good reasons that it was barely 1/3 full..
5
I went to Absynthe last week. I wasa a very regular customer of Oso and Absynthe, but thebills are getting closer to a limit I find inexpectedly inappopropriate. I never have this misfortune at Senso; Wine are always top of the range Italian ones , and for around 100 dollars a bottle, you can have a fantastic wine experience, guided by the Wine Chef Nejib. You can tast Diplomatico Rhum after the dinner and end dinner with a very nice feeling in your mouth.The service is perfect, people have tact and are not pushing heavy to sell you whatever they have (this is what you get at Absynthe with some Ham they are trying to give as apetizer, or people keeping hopening bottles of water one after another, it is not really the price, but we are not exactly in an english pub in Manchester also)In Senso, ask for sitting outdoor, in the meditareanean styale patio, and you will enjoy sitting outside in Singapore with a light breeze. Very nice.Food is excellent price reasonable usually around 220 for two, wine and 2 proseco included as a start. I will keep coming bac
4
Very good food and service.
Meat was great and wine excellent - have thank my buddies for taking me there;
5
Okay, it's not cheap. Ingredients of the quality used here (and so far from their source too) are not cheap. This level of kitchen competence does not come cheap. These levels of service do not come cheap. There are lots of excellent cheap dining options in SIngapore so if "cheap" is what you are looking for, go eat at one of the excellent hawker centres...don't eat at Senso and bleat about it being expensive. It is expensive.Having got that out of the way, this is world class top end italian food using top shelf ingredients, beautifully prepared and served by competent wait staff in a beautiful setting. Every course served to my group of 4 was absolutely perfectly prepared. From simple carpaccio to a sublime seared goose liver on poached pear to truffle and chocolate ice creams with panetone. Yes, it's a special occasion restaurant but every now and again you have to live a little
5
The pasta with truffles was amazingly tasty. It would have to be the best pasta I have ever had. I have to confess I forgot what else I ate... but to this day, I can still remember the taste of this dish.Service was attentive and knowledgeable and the wine list is a great education on Italian wine.
4
Organized a team x'mas dinner for 16people in aprivate room and everyone walked out with a full belly contented with the food and service. Wine connoisseur, manager-Ivan and coordinator-Izan has been very pleasant to work with. Highly recommend this place to anyone, be it casual or corporate event! - CV
2
The night started on a low note when we wer seated at the worst table in the room and it was downhill from there. Who were those other tables for? No one showed up... The food is marginal, particularly at the prices they charge. On several occasions my wine glass was empty, requiring a request for another. The Singapore restaurant market has become saturated with restaurants like Senso. Choose wisely
4
We booked a table in the courtyard and got lucky with the weather. We enjoyed a relaxed bottle of Champagne in the bar first and were not rushed to move to our table. When enjoyed excellent food, the vegetarian in our group was particularly impressed. My prawns to start were perfect; melted in my mouth. I had beef from the special truffle menu as a main, which was tender and delicious. The chocolate eruption was worth the wait.The highlight of the meal was the wine though. The sommelier recommended something cheaper than our suggestion and it was superb; complimented the meal perfectly. Senso is not cheap, but certainly not overpriced either
3
The decor is elegant inside and quite romantic outside,and the service is attentive without being over-the-top.However the food and drink are over-priced for what you get.$22 for a glass of ordinary Chianti is steep,and the food is pleasant but in very small portions.It is sort of "nouvelle cuisine " comes to Italy.Maybe it is just that we think that Italian food is more suited to solid portions rather than this minimalist approach
5
Amazing Restaurant.......I have never had such great service in Singapore before...from the moment you step through the doors to when you leave......The ambience and presence of this restaurant is superb....the staff are so alert of your needs and are pleasant and very professional.....dont see that much in many restaurants......The menu has every dish and flavour to tantalise your taste buds and the dishes you order come out within great timing...not rarely seen in Singapore...makes a change for myself and my partner to eat together.....Senso has an amazing menu to suit all palates....and prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food...and the duo of Panna Cotta is a must!!!!!! A very happy diner and definately will be returning!!!
5
Being able to sit under the stars in Singapore and away from the A/C on a gorgeous evening is a bonus for this restaurant. The service was understated and yet attentive but the stars were definitely the complex flavours in the food served. Absolutely delicious layering of flavours without being over the top. The menu provides a good selection of fish, vegetarian and more than enough for the carnivores too! We celebrated my birthday with friends and a surprise tiramisu was served which was scrumptuous. Definitely a place to return to
3
We booked a table in the courtyard, which looked really nice. Ordered the scallops and goose liver to start. Two tiny scallops turned up on a big plate. Nicely presented, but tomato was slightly overpowering. And 2 scallops for that price is just a little too much. Goose liver itself was tasty, but the poached pear it came with just didn't do it any justice. For mains we had the duck and the seafood capellini in white wine sauce. The pasta was tasty, but the seafood was chopped up to unregconizable bits. Duck was nicely done, but you only get a dessertspoon full of ratatouille on the mash. Had a bottle of red wine which the waiter attempted to decant into a filthy wine-stained decanter. Then came the smarmy maitre'd.....now I completely understand why most diners have issues with this guy. Some diners who knew him turned up and were seated at the table next to ours and started smoking. We protested to him about this and he said this was perfectly acceptable, and quoted some crappy 30% rule. BTW, their pizzas come straight form Spizza, next door....verified this with the waiter who turned up with a bunch of pizzas as we were leaving
3
A good old stager but a little tired and pricey wine. Has a great bar however.
1
It serves mainly pasta. Taste not bad, but it comes very little in small dish and over priced.
Advised to avoid this restaurant unless you entertain clients or girl friend !!!!

In a word... dreadful! The smarmy sommelier, the overcooked shellfish, the deadly atmostpher...

Very nice place for dinner, we where in the court yard which is open air and is was just the best place to be. good food and attentive service and the young sommelier was a great help with the huge wine list. he offered us a nice wine from the norther part of Italy which was great and around a $100/ bottle which for good wine in Singapore is rare to find. we'll definitely back for more

I didn't ate at Senso for at least a year, and, when I came back for dinner with my family this fine evening, I discovered, with a great positive surprise, that the whole place has been revamped into an elegant, warm and stylish fine-dining restaurant, looking much more refined than before the renovations.The Italian-style courtyard offers a romantic ambiance as well as a magnificent view of the sky, if you are lucky enough to come when it's not raining. The reception, bar, private-dining room, and the inside restaurant itself are a subtile and delicate mix of modern and traditional Italian style.After being warmly welcomed, we were seated at our table where the polished cutleries were beautifully set, and a menu offering a wide range of Italian dishes was presented to each of us.The food was not to disapoint either. As an appetizer, I had the famous Buffalo Mozzarella wrapped in parma ham, with olive tapenade on the side. Following was the delicious and papillae-awaking Duo of Risotto by Chef Federico, offering a visual and tasteful delight with it’s mix of risotto with black squid ink with seafood and white risotto with Ca’ Del Bosco Franciacorta Prosecco. As a dessert, I enjoyed the Chocolata, or a warm, melting, chocolate delight with a homemade vanilla ice-cream scoop, and a flavor-rich Italian blend double espresso. During all this time, the friendly and attentive staff displayed a true professionalism, never letting any one of us waiting or without knowing what we were having to eat.Of course, the whole meal was accompagnied by a delightful set of Ca’ Del Bosco Prosecco, Vermentino di Sardegna and a Brunello di Montalcino, as well as the rich and colorful comments of the Tunisian Sommelier (winebutler). This evening was a wonderful experience, and I will definitively be back for more. 9/10

The place is in a quiet area but look exclusive. Once you enter the place the waiter/ waitress will welcoming you and ask if you want to have a drink or dinner. We can sit inside the restaurant or outside which is a small garden with tables and chairs.If you like Italian food this is a right place. The taste is great and the way how they serve you is excellent. The chef or maybe the manager would like to go to your table and ask bout the food also if you ask for their recommendation for the wine, they will help you.I really like this place and recommend it to people who like to have Italian food for dinner or maybe a nice date :

We spent a dinner at Senso and we were really disappointed. We chose a 7 courses menu at S$ 132++ per pax. We chose as well their wine menu which was supposed to match (1 glass for each course) with the meals. We got 5 white wines and 1 red. Most of the wines were not tasty and served frozen in order to hide the lack of savour. They charged us 98S$ for 6 (small) glasses. The food was average, 2 of the 6 courses matched the expectations you may have in this kind of "high end" restaurant.The dessert was "uneatable". We had the feeling to get a piece of butter.Service is average since the waiters describe the meals like a computer without knowing the real roots of the food. We had great expectations but we went out with a sour feeling

Senso was never a great Italian, over priced with a very smarmy sommelier but worth a visit due to its central location and nice courtyard.However today its definitely worth avoiding:- new chef more interested in dressing food than its taste- very over priced- tasteless produceWhen the maitre d asked for and got polite feedback he was dismissive - a good maitre d would offer a token such as a free desert or something.A fancy menu littered with spelling mistakes - no wonder this once popular restaurant was almost empty on the Friday night we ate there.STAY AWAY!http://www.senso.sg

Being Italian I am quite particular when it comes to Italian food & wine and I am happy to say that I went to Senso Ristorante several times in the past years and I have always been more than satisfied. The perfect location in beautiful Club Street, the layout of the restaurant with the wonderful courtyard, the attentive service, the surprising wine list and the sublime quality of the food make Senso a "must try". Furthermore it always delivers a great experience and a perfect venue for romantic dinners, time out with friends and corporate/private functions. I personally enjoy to ask for the chef, Gabriele Piegaia, to come to my table to suggest me a choice of dishes for the night: I know that everytime I am in his hands I am in for a mesmerizing culinary adventure! Enjoy!!

Senso is definitely my favourite restaurant in Singapore - if not the world. Whenever I'm in Singers my first trip is to Club Street. Whether it's antipasti and a drink with a friend, lingering over Sunday brunch or taking someone special to dinner, Senso is a sublime spoil. The ambience lifts your mood as soon as you arrive. The service is special and chef Gabriele piegaia's food unforgettable

I had a great time here; the music was eclectic, the food was great, service excellent, ambience chi-chi. This was years ago so I might go again for an update.

Good for sunday brunch but if you are not drinking, it's too pricey.

Their black ink squid pasta, simply delicious. Not in the menu, have to request specially from the chef... Champagne brunch, irresistable. Considerably cheap.

At $78++ with free flow of Prosecco, this is easily one of the best Sunday "Champagne" Brunches around town. A fine selection of Antipasti and delicious hot Italian Mains served Al-La -Carte-Buffet style. What is also commendable is the excellent service of the waitstaff at Senso. Gracious to say the least. Definitely an experience worth repeatin

A first after hearing about it for 2 years, i was taken in by the coziness of the restaurant, as well as the coolness in the courtyard with its alfresco dining. although never one for wines, it didn't take long for the sommelier to convince us to try out the bottle of Brunello '01. A great recommendation for it brought out the dishes exquisitely

A place worth visiting again!

Good food... Great service but a noisy environment

great selection of wine for you to choose from that delicious enough to go with your dinner... the roasted lamb is a must to try - Agnello Con Ravioli.. after all the dinner.. make your way to W Wine Bar next door and enjoy your puff of cigars..

great ambience and tasty pasta. must end off with the dessert (i was too full for it though, but my colleague was savouring the entire plate of chocolate stuff) . price per pax may comes up to about S$100 for a appetiser, main course and wine
