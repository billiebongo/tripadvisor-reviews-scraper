Good pizza but a simple margarita took 35mins....really they could do a better job. Place was not busy..

Hits and misses, mostly hits though. Peanut butter fries is awesome! I didn't really like the Mala pizza as it is topped with strange balls ingredients, but i love their pasta and when it is served piping hot! yum.

Me and my hubby are searching for a new restaurant and we came up to this place. After a long walk at sentosa, its time to have lunch/snacks because were very hungry. We oredere pizza, pasta and squash soup. I really love theirsoup. I even finished the soup of my husband. Were satisfied about the food and the price
5
Me and my friends had our lunch here in tinos pizza at sentosa and all i can say is the service and food are great...i super love the nachos cheese in their fries and the seafood baked rice that we ate..i would definitely recommend this place to my friends.
5
I been meeting friend. While I passby tinos pizza I've seen the pizza looks fantastic makes me like craving and try. Wow I'm so surprised what I think it's more thank what I see. I can smell the food I order so aromatic and tasty. Specially the mao shan wang is a Durian pizza I love it more cause I'm a Durian lover.... Hey... Guys must try sure u like it!!!

After a morning spent at SEA, my daughter and I were a little hungry so we dropped in at Tino's. The place was almost empty and we were attended to immediately.We ordered a Smoked Chicken and Pineapple Pizza to share and a Banana and Kiwi Smoothie each.The pizza was delicious with a nice thin crust and the smoothie was one of the best I have ever tasted.The service was friendly and efficient
1
Just ate here 1 hour ago and I must say this place is shocking. Served by a sour faced waitress who took order begrudgedly, ask wife what drink she wanted and left me out. Twenty minutes later was served by same miserable waitress a plate of what I can only described as crap, one piece half eaten later, told waitress to remove this pile of disgusting food, I personally wonâ€™t be back, eat at your own peril
4
The food is really nice! We ordered a pizza and the pasta, the pizza is quite nice although it smells a little bad and the taste is a bit strong (though it's with blue cheese so maybe it's supposed to be this way).The pasta is really great though (however recommend you to buy it together with some other treat)! It was really quite a big share and had a lot of stuff inside! Was really nice! Price is a bit expensive but quite worth it. Recommended

Pizza average, it's nice taste and nice crust, but also small in size and nothing too special. Feels much better than industrial ones such as Pizza Hut or similar. Past was just not good, but maybe we were not lucky. Place was packed for lunch, deserted for dinner. Not cheap, also
1
First of all, when I went to pay the bill I was charged an unexpected Service Charge plus GST, so read the menu or signs carefully to find these costs that I missed. I ordered spaghetti with mushrooms, both were reheated, some of the spaghetti had gone hard, some had gone sticky, some both. There was also a half cooked, half raw egg on the plate. Should also mention that I had to wait ages for it..
5
We were very hungry at sentosa and had no veg options so decided to try out Tino's Pizza. Nice layout of the restautant and decent veg options in the normal crust. Good fast service and excellent ambience. Loved it
5
Love the flavourful signore tino & spicy mala pizza. Their unique peanut butter fries is certainly something unique. Love it!
5
Food was tasty, the peanut butter fries was really good. I personally liked their pesto pasta which is herby and garlicky. I actually prefer their pasta to their pizzas.
2
If you think it is ok to wait 15 minutes to make an order, and a half our more to eat a little 20$ pizza - you may come
3
New place and experience for pizza
Their large sized is near to medium in other pizzas and it is nice
It is located near USS and near the acquarium

After a long and tiring day at Universal studios we were looking for a quick meal and stumbled across Tinos. The service was quick and friendly, the selection was good but best of all the pizza was awesome. Traditional style Italian pizza, most enjoyable and will be visiting another of their stores before I leave Singapore.
3
We were looking for a quick lunch at 2.30pm (family of four). Most restaurants were about to close, so fewer options remained. Tino's served us well, as we got a decent pizza at a decent price (not so easy on Sentosa island) with a decent service. Nothing outstanding, though
5
After we has a exhausting but a funny day in uss ( universal studios Singapore) we were starving and seeking for a place where we would find some relive and hoping for some good food which is close to our taste, linguini and pizza were good, service was best thank you Tino's
2
We found ourselves(me and 2 daughters aged 7 and 4) jet lagged and stuck in the restaurant less, limited room service Festive hotel. The girls were desperately seeking Pizza and this was our only open option in resort world.Mixed reviews meant I was concerned - the pizza was small and expensive. We couldOnly get the basic cheese pizza because the rest had odd non family friendly combos and the restaurant would not go off piste at all. My recommendation would be that they start delivering into the hotels - would've made life much easier than dragging 2 small children into the place to get take aways. They shouldOffer someMore standard pizza options and perhaps also just a modicum of friendliness while ordering.It did the job. Reluctantly and only jus
2
We stepped into Tino's for lunch while visiting Universal Studios. The place looked cosy and well-done. Placed combo order. Being a vegetarian I asked them if they could replace the soup with another dish. They were inflexible and plainly refused. We preferred a seat by the window but the staff was rude to not let us sit as we were 3 of us and the table was for 5. So were asked to take high chair seating with a 6 year old. Wonder what the fuss about given the restaurant wasn't occupied at all! The Pizza tasted fine, shake was an ice-shake instead of banana. I could smell flavor of banana though. The pricing is thru the roof. You can give it a miss and try something else
3
I really liked the place so much! It was a lot of fun and nice pizza and jalapeño poppers to unwind with friends
4
Quite pizza restaurant with good food. Their normal size pizza was good and suitable for 1 person to eat. The staffs were friendly and the food were served fast.
4
We were in Sentosa Island and were looking for pure vegetarian option when my daughter saw this restaurant. We were able to find that and the pizzas were really good. My family also enjoyed the milk tea and it was great. Had a great time.
5
Ordered Pesto Pollo Spaghettini and D24 durian pizza. Food does not disappoint. Love the durian pizza, definitely not something you see everywhere!
5
we were there last april 30 with my family. Our first time! We were welcomed by Mac, a very accomodating staff. My kids loved the pizza and pasta....i loved the banana oreo dessert crustar......great service!
3
Had to utilise some expiring Invite$ so decided to give this place a go. The pizza was good but not something you can't get from the mainland. Is ok if you happen to be at RWS as it is one of the more decently priced restaurants there
1
We went to this place after a lovely day at the Universal Studios and I must say this was by far the worst service I experienced in Singapore. They only accepted credit card, staff very unwelcoming and rude and they all seem to be in panic mode and that shows in quality of food. Pathetic place !

Nice restaurant, conveniently located.Went there for lunch, and we had very good pizzas...The service was quick and efficient, the place was clean and cosy.Didn't got a chance to go back a 2nd time... too bad, as it would have been nice.Warmly recommending the place for sure !

Tino's trip advisor reviews are mixed and for this reason I was expecting an average meal. I am happy to report that our meals - pizzas and pastas - were surprisingly delicious. I could go as far as saying that the truffle pizza was one of the best I've ever had. All 6 of us were happy with our meals. The only let down was that the spaghetti bolognese was not available (my first choice of meals). Overall well done Tino's.
2
Nice and clean place. Table service, but you pay your check at the counter.
You can have your pizza either with a thick or thin crust. Whichever you choose - the pizzas are undercooked at too low temperature. No woodfired pizza oven here.
4
I went there twice with my family. It has delicious pizza and some sorts of pasta.I like and suggest it for any person to go there.
5
Handmade pizzas are really great .. n combo meal's are really good and filling ...
Decor : 5/5
Food : 4/5
Service :4/5

It was a nice place! Especially loved the fried jalapeños. I want to go that and have it again. Pizza was also quite good.
5
Fuss free menu.
Attentive service despite Sat night dinner crowd.
Excellent handmade pizzas great for sharing.
4
Mr. Tino's + fries + Coke = Bliss
The way this combo should be.
Food portion was just right for two people.
Will go back.
4
I tried their truffle pizza it was just perfect, the price is good as well
however I didn't like the ice tea
3
The restaurant was practically empty on a weekday at lunchtime. The 2 staff were a little unsure of themselves, so service was definitely not brilliant. However, what made up for it was the food. The pizza crusts were fluffy and light yet had good bite. The soup of the day was quite a generous portion and was tasty.
3
It started with full house for indoor seating and we ended up with outdoor with promise of transferring us indoor where there is table available. It was empty promise. Pizza was still as good and tasty, so is the cheesy fries, which portion reduced by quite a fair bit.I am redeeming my RWS Invites dollars for this meal. First staff show me that there was a fault code and my dollar isn't sufficient. He mentioned that I need to have the sufficient amount before I can claim. Another staff told me that they can only earn points but do not allow redemption. Just when I was going to leave, I saw the sign for "Earn & Redeem" and press them for further clarification. 3rd staff came and said that this can be done and did the reversal and redemption for me. This was the second time such incident happened to me. Staff were totally unclear on what promotion and rewards system available. Only selected few, if you lucky enough to bump into them, able to know what you talking about....sadly.

The meal started with not having soup of the day that was part of a Family of 4 special. Okay not a big deal, so we ordered ala carte. They were then out of the vegetable that goes with the chicken wing selection so we added french fries. Gave them a debit Master Card on a Singapore bank and they could not process (used same card at Hard Rock Cafe same evening). Paid in cash and they did not have change.First two items came to the table with no drinks. Saw the drinks put on the counter to serve but they were left setting. After several minutes, wife went to counter and offered to take drinks but was told to "wait just a minute".After waiting further without the drinks being served I got upset and expressed my displeaure. When the drinks were delivered they included 2 beers when 1 had been ordered.We were too frustrated to stay and said we wanted a refund because we were not going to stay regardless. After a heated exchange with the manager, she refunded our money and we left
2
we could not change any toppings on the pizza,when the pizzas were ready they were left on the middle of the table, so we had to distribute the pizzas ourselves .
5
Delicious pizza.. not too pricey considering. Seems to get busier just after universal studios closes but this was worth the queue.
5
Very good food and friendly staff. Authentic Italian pizzas with a wide variety. Less crowded and good environment. My kids loved the food.
2
some of the menu items were not available. the pizza could not be customised, attendants were stone faced serious and the food was dull and bland. avoid this place
4
Fantastic pizza and great pasta. Price is a little on the high side but it is really tasty food. Great lunch location at Sentosa.
1
I won't dwell on the price much - it's Sentosa after all and a slightly elevated price is expected, however it was unexpected to be unable to customize the pizzas. We ordered the truffle pizza, the gorgonzola pizza and peanut butter fries, and pointed out that we were ordering as vegetarians. The peanut butter fries arrived - complete with bacon on top! We asked for them to change and they said they couldn't. We pointed out that bacon was not mentioned on the menu description so we'd have it exactly as described without this unexpected customization. They agreed to change but 5 minutes later they returned to the table and it was clear the bacon had just been picked off. They were sent back again but when they eventually came back, we really shouldn't have bothered. They had managed to turn a savory goodie into a foul mess of a desert - overly sweet with the bonus of getting a mouthful of hot fat when biting into the middle.The first of the pizzas arrived - the gorgonzola pizza. What can I say but, absolutely disgusting. It had been liberally drizzled with honey making it completely inedible to either myself or my dining partner. We left most of it and when the other pizza arrived 15 minutes lady the (very nice) server said that guests complained quite regularly about the sweetness. Note to chef - if it keeps coming back, the recipe is probably not working.The second pizza was ok - greasy but ok but, after the fries and first pizza, both of us had lost our appetites, so took it away to eat later. A truly memorable meal for all the wrong reasons. I'm still scratching my head trying to work out how it's possible to screw up both pizza and fries and, to charge a small fortune for the privilege
2
I paid over $70 for three little pizzas, poor service and a one way attitude. Firstly, what pizza restaurant does not allow you to customize your pizza? What pizza restaurants does not offer pork options? What restaurant offers only warm water...with no ice? Someone in a previous review referred to the service as cold...I would say frozen. I could put up with a lot of these challenges...but to then have to pay over $ 70 dollars? No thanks and never again

Just visited the Tino's Pizza at Tiong Bahru location for lunch. Was horrified to see staff members eating pizza and chicken wings in view of the dining guest. I could even see the chef eating in the back. Was this the person who was to be making my 'hand-tossed pizza' after putting his fingers in his mouth? Yikes!One young lady would reach into the window to get another food item, eat it and then lick her fingers. After she rinsed her hands in the sink with water only, she proceeded to dry her hands on her pants. It got worse when she coughed into her hands, but did not go back to wash her hands.Also watched as staff took soft drinks from the cooler to pass to staff in the kitchen.Surprised to see that one waitress was on her mobile phone on the dinning floor. I won't be back. There is clearly no management manning the fort. Too unsanitary for me

Pizza here is one of the better ones in town with cosy environment and friendly staff. With high chair for kids, it is easy to dine here with kids. They also serve Ice Milk Bubble Tea which taste good. One of the highly recommended pizza is Truffle Roman Crush Pizza.
3
We went here 2 days back on a crowded evening at around 7 pm after a fun bit tiring dY at the water park. Ambience average. Service average. Food was fine. We ordered their peanut butter fries. Kids did not enjoy these. Pizzas were actually quite nice. Enjoyed them.. It's not the best but if you happen to be hungry and want good pizza go visit. You shall not be dissapointed. They do meals too with soups, pasta , pizza and starters ...
5
Tastefull pizza in normal price for Sentosa island.. Good quality..Not many choices but they cover every preference. ( pizza, salads, pasta and something else I can't recall) Nice small place with helpful staff.
4
Great pizza served with little fuss! Quick service and not too pricey considering its in sentosa. My family of four ate there after a long day in Universal studios
2
The food (pizza) did't taste wery much, and it was far away from "homemade". We had to wait for a long time, and we finished the first pizza before the other was ready. The staff was nice, but the rest was bad.
5
Great chicken wings, great peanut butter fries and great pizza. Also make you don't miss out on the free stuff. Every 30 dollars you spend = free drink or other free thing from a machine.
Incredible food
3
Not very friendly service, average (and quite greasy) pizzas that took ages to arrive and overpriced for what you get. Wouldn't bother - there are better places around.
5
Went to Tino's Pizza Cafe without much high expectation but ended up with a very satisfying tummy. Ordered a large margarita pizza, chicken wings and seafood paella. Everything is nice and we love them all. Will definitely go back if I'm in sentosa again!
5
I tried the Margherita pizza.. So nice and tasty.. Have the real taste.. Me and my kids all live it.. The French Fries is also perfect and nice... I didn't tried other dishes..
1
After we ordered the pizza, they didn't serve us the item we were desperately waiting for. but what they served us was the bill which was so annoying. we paid 20 dollars for a pizza which was pedestrian, mocked the very idea of a pizza and was horrible. the staff behaved they were least bothered about you and were only interested in extracting money. Have never had a worse experience in my 15 years of travel. HIGHLY AVOIDABLE. YOU WOULD FEEL ROBBED

We visited Tino’s after spending hours at the museum, aquarium and Sentoso Merlian. It was the perfect stop. We ordered the regular sized (six slices) of pizza called “Mr. Tino” and were surprised at how incredibly delicious it was. This place really knows how to make pizza! They also had a promotion on for pizza, pasta and two bowls of soup, but we found the pizza alone a great meal for the two of us. The service was o.k. We would definitely recommend Tino’s Pizza
4
We were fairly surprise by the pizzas and they were yummy! Tried the following, regular size of 6 slices: Duck pizza with diced broccoli and it was Yummy!! Would be better if it was skinless as a healthier choice :) Mr Tino pizza (chicken) excluding chicken bacon for a healthier selection was tasty as well. We couldn't quite finish it as we cleaned off the pasta. Lastly we ordered beef bolognese tomato pasta and I loved the baked cheese and basil tossed in the pasta with it. Promotion for 1 pizza + 1 pasta + 2 bowls of soup for $39.90 was a pretty good deal
4
Good veggie pizza .... Delicious cheese fries....must go place specially Indian if you are Veggie...friendly staff....
1
Couldn't decide which was worst. Soup of the day pumpkin soup was diluted, Spanish omelette (top with two slice of ham) and pizza were bland, seafood paella was precook and oven baked before served. Paella rice was dry, squid was tough like rubber.
3
Good place to grab a quick bite as Starbucks and ceaseless are always packed. Good pizzas and garlic bread. Nicely presented and nice ambiance
1
Do not eat here unless your idea of good food, is food that is bland and tasteless and leaves you feeling ill from being to oily!
1
Venue was fine, service was okay aside from a slight service mixed up.No tap water available, ~$3.50/500mL bottle.Pizza was awful - very light on flavour and odd toppings. Pasta was awful - watery mess with weird rubbery chicken (on a bolognese?). Weird plastic/liquid cheese on top of cheesy fries.Do not recommend.Meal of 3 waters, 1 coke, 1 pizza, 1 pasta, 1 cheesy fries cost almost S$100
4
When we visited resorts world sentosa me and my family is craving for a pizza. I must say this place is just an average pizza place the food is just alright but the service is great. Mac is very attentive always smiling and attending not only us but all the guest. He's an great asset in your establishment. Good job Mac keep it u
2
How is it that a premixed mushroom can be so badly screwed up? Cream could not be dissolve in a soup?! Please, if you are at RWS sentosa and need your pizza pasta fix, go dine at Hard Rock Cafe or Chilis. Even the golden arches deliver better.
1
Where do I start with this nightmare.... The wait staff are uninterested and rude. Our drinks took 20 mins to turn up and they forgot one of them, they screwed up the kids pasta order after waiting 40 mins for that to turn up. I ordered the lamb pizza and it was a greasy mess..... Wouldn't go back, couldn't recommend it
4
Restaurant had good options in Veg pizza. Although I was expecting a crunchy thin pizza. I came thin but was not crunchy at all. We ordered french fries too. Fries were not crispy and were extra long. overall good option till better restaurants open with Veg food
4
Found it while looking for an alternative to asian food, tired of the subs and street food vendorsPlace is medium size, interesting arrange of tables chairs, I like the concept it was more less mix of minimalistic and contemporaneousMenu has decent options, from pasta to pizzaI personally tried the spaguetti bolognese and flavor was really good, portion enough to feed 2 but if starving to death then I recomend asking one per personI tried too the pizza bolognese and it was good too, but I prefered the pastaAbout others reviews around the subject when trying to change ingredients even by paying extra and the personnel don't wan't to, I will be fair to say that even when in NA and Europe this type of things are normal, in my experience through China and Singapore the personnel stick to the menu and their processes not allowing changes so I would consider this as normal and not giving bad points about this, but of course if they agree on changes then is a bonus, I tried here too but response as expected was no, so no big dealPersonnel was friendly, and something not typical is that they will leave you the check at the table and you have to go to the cashier to pay, no hassle since is a small place so no long walking but It was a surpriseOrders arrived on time, considering it was sunday around 16:00 and just 2 free tables I would have to say service was goodPrices, agree that this is not cheap but definitely is a choice if you are in a budget.For payment they will take MC, VISA and Union Pay (bonus!)Worth to go at least once, flavors are ok and prices ok considering the are
