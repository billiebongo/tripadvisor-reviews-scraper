I have an order food style of Thai and Chinese. But it's really authentic taste which I had from them. Really they are specialist in food preparing.

A bit pricey in the Geylang area but the taste of the food lingers in your tastebud memory. The chili crab, the braised pork , the lemon chicken and their hot and spicy soup made our day

Golden Jade Palace Located at 233 Geylang Rd, Singapore, Golden Jade Palace serves Chinese cuisine. They also offer Zi Char and steamboat. This place will delightfully excite you with succulent tastes. This is a standard neighbourhood place. Down-to-earth and not somewhere u want to bring someone for a classy meal. Anyway the food on offer is average but if u want run-of-the-mill Chinese cuisine with touch of Malaysian in a pleasant no fuss environment then this is the place. Service was prompt given the fact that the restaurant was busy. However watch out for extra charges for wet towels, and take away boxes. The service staff could be more livable with a touch of friendly vibes and a better communication would also help. Overall the Food was ordinary but the service is little bit depressing

I was walking along Geyland road and a lady from this restaurant approached to me and explained the menu. I asked Chili crab. It was cheap but not delicious. I said i do not need wipe towel but they gave me anyway and charged me too

The food is great. The food serving is good for sharing even if you will order small. They have plenty of dishes in the menu. My favourite here is the Chicken Cereals and ribs. It's a must try. They also serve "frog" dishes which i will never dare to try. I thought that they make their own dumplings (pork with leeks) only to find out that they also buy it in the market. I bought a frozen dumplings with the exact same taste with what they serve. Too bad for them but good for me as I'd rather buy in the market and fry it myself. A lot cheaper. It's surprising that they charge for the wet tissue towel. It's part of their table set up which should be free. You must put a price tag for the wet towel because every customer will assume that it's free. It's not expensive but it's just not proper that you will only find out that you were being charged of the wet tissue towel when they have presented the bill. The service could have been great if all the servers could communicate in English. One more thing, they will charge you for take away box if you have excess food. Unbelievable. Food was great but the service is little bit disappointing.

Checked out the menu earlier with delightful restaurant lady making a suggestion.When I returned after a walk I new what I was going to order. The other lady served me and made me feel welcome with her friendliness.She returned to see that I needed anything else without any pressure just care.She came to my table as I was nearing the completion of my filling and tasty beef dinner. She asked if there was anything else that she could get for me as she was to work upstairs. Thank you to her and the other lady who was busy doing accounts but glanced up with a smile from time to time. The environment and the service and the food was a totally enjkoyable and tastefu
