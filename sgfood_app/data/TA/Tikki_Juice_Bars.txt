I would really recommend the Indian Coffee here. With a little difference with the coffee at hawkers, this is a must try!

I got the dole whip float and honestly I would recommend the the original soft serve over it. Thought if you're super thirsty you can get the float, chug the juice then eat the ice cream. I find eating the ice cream first made the juice taste less good after.
