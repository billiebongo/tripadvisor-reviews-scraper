A little bit out of the way from CBD but they offer some amazing seafood dishes. Worth a visit if in neighbourhood

Visited again the Long Beach restaurant at the East Coast Singapore. Had the Chilli Crab again and it was delicious as I remembered. Staff are friendly, and the price is reasonable. Well worth it.

If you want to sit by the sea and enjoy the breeze while enjoying your seafood, this is the ideal place. However, JUMBO is by far the most popular (definitely has to reserve) but there are other seafood restaurants with lesser queue.

One of the typical dishes in Singapore is the chilli crab. ItÂ´s delicious, a bit hot but not too much. I order a full crab and cost me $78. It weighted about 1 kilo.
You should also try the deep fry baby squids, awesome!
5
Amazing value of food for the money spent and nice mix of locals and expats crowd. Will be back for more, beer was cold!

Seafood was very expensive. There was no value for money. Cost more than $200 for dinner just for 4 persons.

I guess like all tourist attractions, they get a bit tired. The food here (we ate at Jumbo both times) was not as good as during our first visit some years ago. And the service is a bit snappy, but not in a good way. Short tempers and impatience amongst the staff on display for all to see. Also, Singapore can be very hot so best to sit inside near the open doors and near an overhead fan. You will still get the view but without the heat! The fabulous part of a trip to the East Road Seafood Centre is the amazing view of the hundreds of ships lined up waiting to load/unload their cargo in Singapore. That alone is worth the trip - we were astonished even though we've seen it before. Best way to get there? Taxi

Very clean seafood restaurant, Indonesia is opposite the sea, don't feel hot even sitting outdoor, the black pepper crabs are so delicious, we go there every time we visit Singapore, other dishes are also good. Better make a booking in advance otherwise may need to queue for longer

I think it used to be better. The chill crab and black pepper crab maintains its standard but I would expect more with a price tag like this. Small crab is about 800g is approximately $60-$70 (can't rem the exact amount). With competition from others, Jumbo needs to work harder. The prawn with salted egg yolk is so so. The Hor fun used to be very good. Now just about anyone can do it. Starchy and lumpy. Not much of Wo hei. For this price level, there are better restaurant with better value and service. There are still a huge crowd, presumably due to its name. Longer worth the money.

I was in transit for 5 hours in Singapore and decided on meeting a friend for an early dinner at East Coast Seafood Center. Good decision, since it is very close to the airport and I didn't want to get stuck in traffic by taking a taxi to the city (the MRT / subway would take about an hour). The food was alright, and despite being a seafood restaurant, there were a variety of cuisines on offer including vegetarian options (limited)
5
When you arrive and want to get away from the airport this is a great place to stop to get some quality eats. It might be a little more than your average hawker stand but still worthwhile and good to eat.

I just loved the Singapore Chilli Crab, I have been recommending it to everyone going to Singapore. It is a must try dish. I cannot wait to have it again. It is served with freshly baked rolls. It is really is yum.
4
Decent place to get your fix of sea food the staff is very friendly and recommend the right stuff, a good experience overall
5
Loved the setting of this Jumbos restaurant, worth the easy taxi ride from the centre of Singapore. The crab was amazing, both the chili and black pepper options highly recommended
4
We enjoyed the famous Jumbo Seafood Chilli Crab, and the lovely deep fried bread rolls to soak up the juice. Delicious.
The crab is freshly prepared to order so be prepared for a wait.

Had a great time sitting outdoor enjoying the sea breeze. Food was great just costly.
Will be back regularly of course with visitors coming in.

I am very fussy when selecting vegetables to go along with my seafood meal. Kailan with oyster sauce always my favourite choice and I am very happy. The vegetable cook perfectionist, green, fresh, and crunchy. Overall, the quality of the food excellent! Well done.
4
This is my favourite for Black Pepper Crab. Whilst the Chili Crab is OK, I've had better. I will keep going back for the Black Pepper Crab though, it really is great. The environment is what you'd expect from a Singaporean food court - its clean enough. The place is well set up for large groups - big round tables, jugs of beer, sharing plates. A good night out, where we've taken business guests and friends who are visiting Singapore for the first time. There's a lot of locals eating here, so that indicates a good balance between food quality and price

We visited Long Beach at the seafood Centre. Great varied menu, including good value set menus.We opted for Chilli crab(with fried buns), drunken prawns, fried baby squid, garlic spinach and lemongrass bean sprouts!! Dessert mango with coconut jelly and cream and a black rice with ice cream. All the food was second to none! No complaints at all, the staff even peeled our prawns and pulled all the meat out of the crab too. Very handy!! The staff were courteous and the atmosphere welcoming.There was 3 of us including two rounds of drinks $210 SG

Went there without booking and got a table in 10 min. Recommend to be early for dinner as que is building up fast on a sunny day. Sat outside and saw sunset with ships on the bay outside. Great view. Food was fantastic. So was wine selection. It is not fine dine, but more for family and friends. Great atmosphere. We also tried large shrimps. Very delicious. Plenty of tea served with food. I would recommend to everybody. And for sure we will be back.
5
Great Location and also good food relatively pricy but not overpriced(for crabs) there is a garden which has crabs so watch out and if u r indonesian its close to batam n u can get signal
5
Been here a few times now and each time I visit I come away having enjoyed it. Location is great overlooking the bay with all the ships laid at anchor. Always busy so best off booking.
5
Went there last year and it was just as awesome this year. The food is wonderful and the sticky buns not to be missed for mopping up the chilli sauce.

We got to know about this place when we asked our taxi driver where to get the best chilli crab. Unfortunately, it's a little difficult to get here by public transport. Taxi ride would cost about $20 from Novena square depending on traffic. This area is beautiful. We arrived just after dusk (7pm) and the ships offshore were lit up and looked magical. We opted for the less expensive restaurant which had a variety of local and western food.We had the chilli crab and black pepper crab with rice. The taste was totally amazing, a little messy to eat but who cares!All together it cost about $50 for two people. A nice stroll after dinner around the bay topped off a great dinner experience.

Pretty much have to get a cab here which is a little painful. We ordered the chilli crab a plate of veggies and the deep fried cod, all of which was amazing. Completed with a few beers. Unsurprisingly given the quality of food it cost around 180, but at the end of the day worth it. Not often you sit next to be bay with what must have been a few hundred ships waiting to drop off cargo, quite a site
4
Went here on a business night out. Always a little hesitant when people say seafood because I am allergic to most but have to say that the food here looked first class and I believe it was quite delicious as there was NOTHING left at the end of the evening except empty shells and empty bottles! The management also managed to serve up some excellent meat dishes for me

Asked a cabbie where to go for Singapore Chilli Crab and he recommended here. Best Tom Yum Soup I have ever tasted. Chilli Crab good and the Black Pepper Crab better. Don't wear your best clothes as things can get messy. Staff were really helpful and the food is served accompanied by some very unusual non-alcoholic drinks. Nice view of the sea. Recommended..

This is a row of ca six restaurants serving different (sea)food styles. We did not try because we wanted to enjoy the big selection of the well reputed food centre. If you look for a hawker style food centre, you need to walk ca 200m towards the east
4
We went to sample the famous black pepper crab, which was excellent, but very, very hot. The business thrives on speed of throughput, so you may feel a bit rushed, but we did not make a reservation so this was only to be expected. It was a little pricey for what we got, but the food itself was very tasty and beautifully cooked. A lovely location looking out to the ships anchored off the coast and hearing the waves lap in
4
This a place where they are different seafood restaraunts mostly all selling chilli crabs as their main dish. Personally I feel that there is no good or bad of the different restaraunts, as its just the cook and the cooking method is different. However this place is surely more high end if being compared to the neighbourhood area, but it's worth paying for the cleaniess and eating by the beach.

This restaurants not only over price, please make sure you you can get a taxi back to the hotel later. Long Q and long wait, some time the taxi driver can refuse to take you if your destination is not within their desired place.
Beware.
4
Here there is a good selection of seafood restaurants so you will have a good selections to chose between. It is perfect last stop before the airport if you are retuning at night.
5
Nice location, shore side, overlook sea, busy and fast attentive service, very comprehensive menu, not necessarily on the cheap side, but that's not why you go there ;-). Loved it

We went to the Sea food centre for the Black Pepper Crab. It was delicious,We also had drunken prawns and and some Sea Shells. Overall excellent experience by the Sea

Never had such amazing chilli crab. With the place on east coast , after a good walk and jog to just sit down here on a breezy weather and having some chilli crab makes it a perfect evening.I did try out the sting ray fish and thai coconut water but the chilli crab for some reason was my favourite .The place is bustling with a lot of people and activities around

If you want to experience the real authentic Singapore Chilli Crab experience then the East Coast Seafood Centre is an absolute must. The three most famous restaurants are Jumbo Seafood, Long Beach (where black pepper crab was invented) and Red House. You can choose from live Scottish Brown Crab S$65/kg, Blue Lobster or spoil yourself on Alaskan King Crab S$120+/kg. All seafood is fresh as you would expect but its the sauce that makes these venues stand out from the numerous restaurants in Singapore that have Singapore Chilli Crab on their menu, but if you're after the real deal- head to East Coast Seafood Centr
5
There are several restaurants at the East Coast Seafood Centre, we ate in the Long Beech restaurant. The food was very good, we had lobster, and chilli crab. The view from the restaurant looks out to sea and the service from the staff was brilliant. Definitely worth a visit.

Went there to celebrate birthday. Order the chilli crab and 3 other simple dishes. Cost us a bomb! Being a local, I think it is very overpriced.There are many other available restaurant that are similar to this seafood restaurant and priced lesser.Unless you are on company account, otherwise don't come here

A friend recommended East Coast Park for seafood so my partner took me here for my birthday dinner and it was delicious. We both enjoyed the dishes we choose and would recommend it to others, yummy dishes. I also enjoyed the clams and giant prawns. We took a cab from our hotel (Furama Riverfront) as it was the easiest way to get there. There are other restaurants along this strip which overlooks the sea. It was very busy but we managed to get a table outside with a view of the sea. Very enjoyable birthday

We ate at the Jumbo Seafood restaurant because a local woman walking her dogs said it was the best out of all the ones there. A friend had told us to come out there to the other food area but it was closed for cleaning for 5 days. Glad we went to Jumbo. I had "drunk shrimp", 11 giant shrimp for S$23. My husband has a giant plate of chicken fried rice, said it was the best flavor he has ever had, it was $11ish and we also had 10 Sarah that were $.70 each (have to order a minimum of 10). The Sarah meats were small but hey, they were .70 each. Lovely evening breeze. Place is terribly busy so you might want to call to make reservations. We walked up but after we arrived we saw many people waiting quite a while for tables. A 35 minute drive from downtown. We took bus 197 back and it took us right to our Intercontinental hotel. Going we took MRT then a bus. Worth the trip
