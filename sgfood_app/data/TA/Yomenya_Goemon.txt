Quick and friendly services. The portion of food is big and satisfied with the taste of the food. Between, there is a room for improvement for the desserts.

A Japanese-Western noodle restaurant, they've got familiar dishes such as Spaghetti Carbonara, or Spaghetti alla Genovese but what caught my eye was probably its specialty: "Yomenya Goemon Sukiyaki (Beef) Spaghetti"! An interesting concept of combining perfectly cooked spaghetti with well marinated thin slices of beef and wild mushrooms steeped in their signature Sukiyaki sauce, and my favourite part, topped with an egg yolk. Crack the egg yolk, mix it into the pasta and you've got a well-thickened sukiyaki sauce! Is it worth it? It's a little pricey but yes it's worth it. What's not to like about well-cooked pasta (al dente) and amazing base sauces? Great service, amazing company and good food

We ordered their Business Lunch Set, which seems to be reasonably priced. East set comes with a salad, soup, choice of pasta, and a drink.I ordered the Japanese Aglio Olio with Chicken because I was intrigued by the picture on the menu: it has pasta with lotus roots. The pasta was quite tasty and wasn't too oily. However, what I had looked nothing like the picture on their menu (what did I expect?): there were only 2½ really thin slices of lotus root, nothing like the generous amount they presented on their picture!We were here during lunch time and the place wasn't crowded. So we were able to eat at leisure and chatted.Overall we found the Business Set Lunch value for money

Great Restaurant a little to the expensive side but affordable. Great food especially their spaghetti. Their creamy base(spaghetti )has very strong flavor and the aglio oli is very delicious and light on the mouth.Miso soup there is super . Fast service great food a good place to dine:)

Few years ago they have 3 or 4 Yomenya Goemon in Singapore, I dont know why, this year (2016) only one left maybe very striced competition among restaurant bussiness in singapore that cause dimminished number of this chain retaurant (eventhough in Tokyo there are still several Yomenya Resto existed). How they cooked pasta still good, but a bit to oily and less ingridient? or they not stir it well in the frying pan.. Idont know. Japanese QC must be routinely checked it.　Less choise of pasta compare to restaurant in Japan

Quick service and a satisfying lunch at reasonable prices! They have Lunch sets which gave us a nice fresh salad, drink of choice and a small cup of clear soup for a small additional charge with any main meal. The serving sizes of the pastas were very generous. I liked the olive genovese pasta, with an assortment of vegetables and crunchy fresh prawns. The tomato pescatora had a nice assortment of seafood. There's table seating which is better than the other small restaurants in Star Vista which are more cramped.

I love pasta, i love japanese cuisine, and thus Yomenya Goemon is the place that never disappoint me. Carbonara is yummy and filling, i always struggle to finish one serving. My favourite would definitely be Mentaiko Pasta, which i always order whenever I visit Goemon. Service is usually slow, but that's how i know my pasta is freshly made. The tea/soup served before the meals is pretty tasty as well, though it's probably MSG soup. Ask for Ginger Ale when you order a set, they do a perfect serve for you

Having dined at various Yomenya outlets in Japan, we were excited that the fusion pasta franchise had decided to open shop in Singapore. However, the quality of the food here was disappointing. The pasta was overcooked and the sauces/seasonings had none of the flavours and fragrance of their mainland Japanese cousins

Wide range of cooking styles - cabonara, tomato, japanese, olive oil & garlic, etc. Spaghetti still 'springy' but I like it. The clam chowder spaghetti is good but the chowder would be better if it's 'thicker'.The set meals give more value - spaghetti, soup/soft drink and dessert. The half & half set is also a good option to taste two cooking styles without over eating

This outlet is located within the Star Vista shopping center. It serves only spaghetti with a large variety of sauces. The pasta itself could have been cooked one more minute but it is a matter of taste and I was quite happy with it. I chose a tomato sauce with tons of hot sausage. It was very good. With a soft drink, taxes and service, the total was S$20.60, which is quite reasonable
