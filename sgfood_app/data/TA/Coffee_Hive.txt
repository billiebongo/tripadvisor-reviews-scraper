This is my almost daily breakfast spot. Staff is quick, helpful and very friendly. You can get many types of breakfast tea and coffee and toast sets. My favorite is peanut butter with honey teh o.

I really love the curry here. Also the black pepper chicken is awesome ! I suggest you also to order the cheese fries.

Coffee and teh at an affordable price in today's context. I buy at the outlet at novena square2.
Recommended are the coffee-si and yuanyang-si. Tea is too weak.

Coffee Hive offers convenience and budget fare to folks in the CBD. Whilst Coffee Hive have a more elaborate menu, such as dim-sum, toast, nasi-lemak (coconut rice with egg and small fishes), the CBD executives typically come here for a quick coffee/tea and toast or bun (pao). This is open from 7 am to 8 pm M - F. Not easy to find when one walk along the road. It is in Cecil Court next to a road junction at Cecil Street (odd and even address numbering in each side). Not for tourists unless one drop by for a rest and quick bite during a tour of the financial district

Since we didnt had bfast from Oasia so I came to Basement 1 Square 2 to have our bfast almost everyday at Coffee Hive. They served local food. The toast for me was better than the other. The bread not so crisp, which was perfect for me. The staffs friendly. The food was good.
