An excellent hotel with central location it is in the heart of little india surrounded with lots of Indian restaurants b hotels I was in a club room on the 19 th floor with club lounge exclusively for those rooms with priority checking and round the clock lounge rooms are good with all facilities. Only variety in veg food is required as lots of Indians visit this hotel. A good hotel overall would like to go again there

Hi ppl, it's one of the best choices of hotels in Singapore especially if you are an Indian...alot of Indian tourist. .The staff is very cordial, rooms are big, proper cleanliness maintained at all times,breakfast is amazing, alot of options to seek through... Yes options for jain, vegetarians too...The hotel provides gym and swimming pool facilities to the guests.. One important facility to be noted is, it is disabled friendly, it has different escalator for disable..The hotel provides wheelchair, strollers, umbrella to the guest without any extra charge..The biggest advantage is the location, it's close by little India where one can find all Indian restaurants like Kailash parbat, Balaji, Anand bhavan, copper chimney....Neighbouring 24hrs open Mustafa Market, huge supermarket, one stop shop for all your needs....Few SuggestionsPls arrange for water facilities at the lobby, as guests are asked to go to 6th floor...Put a mark of green and red to differentiate for vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes, as it becomes easier for us.

The outstanding theme of the hotel are the lusn tropical gardens located on all floors of the hotel and the innovative interior designs.Most surprising for this 347 room hotel are the competitive, affordable prices. Across the street is a lovely park. The location of the pool at mid level is quite incredible... the first hotel where there is a whole floor with no rooms... only a luxurious pools and surrounding gardens

This hotel is punching above its weight and feels like more than a 4 star. Spacious well designed room with great view. Huge comfortable bed, quiet effective air on, great shower. The whole of the hotel is impressively designed. I stay in a lot of hotels and this was probably the best hotel breakfast I've had - superb choice and quality. Very friendly and efficient staff. Also opposite the MRT station so handy for getting around. I recommend!

We have been there for Easter holiday this year. This hotel using a lot of plant for decorating outside of the hotel wall. They supported environmental protection using this way. We are very appreciated. Their room is big and nice, today and clean. We loved to stay there. The hotel is located near the china town. We can enjoyed shopping and eating in different nice restaurant near the hotel area. We found it is very convenient.We high recommended guest to chose staying this hotel

I've stayed here on several occasions and it is consistent. It's a good standard business hotel but not super luxury. The rooms are well equipped and functional and the breakfast range is impressive. Rather unusually a lot of the rooms are accessed off covered but open air walkways which have a lot of foliage. There are superior rooms which get you access to the lounge and food area on the 16th floor which I found nice, since the downstairs breakfast can be very busy.The CBD location is good if that's the location of your business meetings as sometimes cabs are hard to come by.This is certainly not in the same league as the Fullerton etc but it's reliable, comfortable and difficult to find fault with

Different hotel, very clean! The variety of light was exellent (work, relax, sleep). Poolarea is amazing, bit tiny, but ok. The noise from street is loud! Gym is ok, no busy times during our stay (3days).Wi-fi worked well. Water is complimentary every day, but the bottles were glass, so hard to carry with.The buffet looked delicios and huge. There is good restaurants close to the hotel

We upgraded on arrival and was well worth it. Our room was brilliant with great view. The hotel was extremely clean in a decent location and staff were excellent.

From the first moment we cross the doors of the hotel we have been welcome, the room was impeccable and the service A1.
The room service menu can have some improvement.

Stayed 4 nights in Parkroyal on Pickering and found it wonderful! The design and the architecture of the building are absolutely marvelous! Th room size (Superior double) was good - even though these rooms are not huge, the very high ceilings and the very functional interior design compensated well. Highly recommended

Had the buffet dinner here (need to have minimum of 4 people). It was really good. You pay per person (discounted for certain credit cards, which unfortunately, we didn't have) and you order from a menu. You can order as many things as you like from the menu, e.g. we ordered 2 dishes of wasabi prawns to share (very delicious!). Not that keen on the cold dishes but the hot ones were very good - fish, prawns, soup, etc. etc. They only have it at certain times of the year, so ring and ask before booking. Because you order from the menu, the food is freshly cooked - doesn't sit around in a bain marie. I have been twice now and we are hoping to visit again on our next trip

Check-in was a challenge and the staff seemed to be inexperienced. Walking outside (but under cover) to the room past the hanging garden was a first. The infinity pool with multi-colored cabanas with nice to hang out but construction in the area made it a bit noisy. i understand the environmentally friendly approach mean that plastic water bottles in the room were replaced by refilled glass water bottles, however, the cap is purely designed - I managed to both have difficulty getting it off and throwing water all over the bed and have the cap spring off and drop. Room is nice enough with a compact design. Hotel was 15 minutes walk from Gate 5 of the Singapore F1GP.

I was there for a seminar which include a coffee break and buffet lunch. Service is great with nice environment! There is wide variety of food for the buffet. The one I like the most is the salmon sashimi and prawn, fresh! Not to mention, the grill lamb is nice as well. Overall is good. But if you ask me whether to visit again just for the buffet lunch, I won't say yes immediately since I will take the buffet price ($48) into consideration. PS: Macaroon is not included in the buffet, too bad

This was our second visit, and had the same room as before. A corner room on the 9th floor. With floor to ceiling windows, giving great views over Singapore. It is worth taking advantage of the club lounge. We were there during the 50th Independence Celebrations and had wonderful views from the lounge on the 16th floor
