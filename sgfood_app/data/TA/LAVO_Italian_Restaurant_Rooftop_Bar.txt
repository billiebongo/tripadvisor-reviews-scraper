Went Lavo for the first time tonight to celebrate a special occasion because of the venue and judging from the price, should be a good evening with great food but unfortunately, we experienced the opposite.Venue - Great with amazing view Service - it was good as we were there on weekday and early.Food - Over priced & not up to the standard. A plate of pasta cost around $48 before tax & service charge. We both didn’t finish our food which never happens but we just simply cant continue.Ordered the Nutella mousse with hazelnut and it’s not cold & just a small sprinkle of hazelnut bits so mostly soft room temperature mousse so again, disappointed.Hopefully, the food will get improvement or else it would be a shame for such nice venue.Still worth to go for a drink & enjoy the view but not the food

Our first - and certainly last - visit to Lavo was very disappointing. For one thing, food has to be excellent for the prices they charge. Sadly it was not. It’s mediocre, to say the least.Ambience and lighting in the restaurant was fine – at least during the early evening hours. As the dinner progresses the lighting was dimmed to such extent that by 9pm we could no longer see the food on the plate very clearly.The same progression applies to the music played by a DJ and sound levels eventually reached a point where a discussion among us became difficult.The quality of the food was very low, bland and had little to do with real Italian food. A tenderloin steak at $80.- plus $6.- for a sauce to go along, plus $18.- for some mediocre French fries (menu said truffle fries, but no trace of truffle taste was found) was not cheap, especially when considering that no indication is given as to where the beef is from. Whilst making a reservation we were asked whether we were celebrating and in fact it was our 20th wedding anniversary which we mentioned in response to her enquiry. This was not acknowledged in anyway, when upon arrival at the restaurant a ‘’Thank you for celebrating your anniversary with us’’ would have been a nice gesture and of no cost to the restaurant. In fact, the man who was at the entrance played the perfect role of Lord of the LAVO - He who had the power to seat us, and He who made us feel that we should be grateful that we even had a seat. That’s the first impression we got. Although, we must say, the lady who brought us to the table was a sweetheart, and the one who served us was friendly and attentive. One wonders why MBS should enter into a partnership with the TAO group from the USA to end up with such an undistinctive F&B outlet. LAVO tries to be a restaurant, a bar, a sightseeing point, a discotheque but in the end it is not good at either of these. Avoid until the next concept comes up on the 57th floor

We visited earlier around 5pm. We are the first couple sitting at the right side of the big round table at the center. Service was really good ny Viggie or ziggy? I cnt remember the name. I just notice servers or even manager came to us and check hows our food,and explaining also the weather is not good so we seated indoor. They forgot to introduce who they are so initial reaction is we are just staring and nodding. But overall was very good.Especially the Seafood alfredo, and the Cod Fish. We will definitely come back for a drink/cocktail or wine, as the staff also explaining that after 10pm restaurant will be turn to club

We did not have food, only drinks.The views are great, take an elevator in Tower 1.I think the staff was a bit confused when we asked for drinks outside their menu(though fairly classic ones). You can watch either the sea or the city, up to you

This is a classic example of over priced and low on service restaurant. The staff are condescending and lack basic etiquette. We went there to celebrate our wedding anniversary and even informed the booking person in advance (she had asked specifically if we are celebrating something on that day). There was NOTHING done to acknowledge our anniversary- no token dessert, flower or anything, in spite of having told them. Even a local restaurant down our street would do something to make our evening special after having told them that we are celebrating our anniversary :(.Will NOT go back ever again and will NOT recommend this to anyone with any degree of sensitivity

Bad food and bad service. Menu was completely overpriced even by MBS standards. Pasta was hazardously salty - we returned this and were horrified when it was replaced with pasta even saltier than before. Cancelled the pasta for the dessert then got charged full price for pasta AND the replacement dessert. Took very long for our meals/replacement meals to be served, and the bill to be sorted out. Words cannot express my disgust and disappointment at this meal. One of the few places in Singapore I would strongly advice against visiting!

So this is the first time we've been here and came for husband's birthday.We got a booth table facing the ocean view.Service was very good and attentive.We started with Minestrone soup. Had zero flavor even when we asked for a little bit of salt & pepper still didn't make a drastic difference. The price of soup was completely NOT worth it.They serve you really good garlic knots breads, one each with a plate of Parm cheese, olives and other items to have with your bread.We ordered Chicken parmigiana which for one person is quite a huge portion as they fillet open the breast. Good thing we shared it.I asked for 2 more garlic bread and she said she'd have to charge me. For two small pieces of bread-Really? Ok?We ordered Tiramisu for dessert which was quite a nice sized portion. Made with espresso & Kahlua. The lady fingers were not soaked enough in coffee/liquor as it was too dry. I ordered cappuccino which I ended up pouring some on cake to moisten it up. But the coffee was not good...was a bitter taste. Decent size cup. Glass of red wine averages more than $25.Place is quite expensive for a regular dining experience...ok for special occasion like it was for us tonight.There's also an outdoor patio to have drinks overlooking the view

We paid to go up to the observation deck on the opposite end of the Marina Sands. A couple of days later, we had dinner at Lavo. We booked in advance but we did see that people were making same day dinner reservations or coming up for drinks and the view.The view is spectacular from the wrap around deck and the drinks and food are priced similarly to decent restaurants in Singapore (we had an appetizer, 2 dinners and 2 drinks for about $250 SD). The food is Italian and is good.The staff was friendly and attentive. We asked our server about busy times and he told us that Friday and Saturday were busiest, and the restaurant got busier starting at about 7 pm.A fair number of people came up for a drink, which is about the price of the admission to the observation platform. We noticed that they did not rush people at all who came up and had only one drink. There is also limited food service available at the outside bar.There are views of both the Gardens and the city and you can catch a glimpse of the infinity pool for the hotel also. Both daylight and evening views are spectacular. We definitely recommend Lavo

If you're visiting Singapore and you like good food with a view this must be on your todo list.We booked a 5.30pm reservation (booking recommended) to allow time for food and then to enjoy the sunset over the city on the 57th floor roof top restaurant of the Marina Bay Sands hotel (the ship hotel).From the moment we arrived the service was first class, made even better by our waitress explaining about the decor & materials used which was quite fascinating. The food choices were very good, I had prawns to start and black cod followed by fruit, my wife went for the steak, all of which was absolutely excellent, as were the cocktails and wine.We requested a table outside to have sweet which they kindly sorted and we enjoyed the spectacular views across the city and witnessed a wonderful sunset.In my view this is one of the most spectacular places to have dinner anywhere in the world and we will be back when next in town

Will be back next time we are in Singapore

Firstly the views are spectacular and combine this with drinks its perfect, the service is very good and has a pleasant atmosphere. The music is a little too loud to be able to hear people across the table, the food is good but not fantastic - its the missing piece in what would make this place top notch

When we stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, we made a reservation to eat in Lavo, an Italian restaurant on the rooftop of the hotel.The restaurant gave a comfortable atmosphere. Waiters were all very attentive and they were reassuring couple of times if everything is fine.When we then got our food, I was amazed by the taste of the food.I ordered salmon with breadcrumbs and vegetables.We will definitely come back to eat there

This place took over from one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore, Sky on 57, mainly because of the outside bar, the best and least crowded in Singapore with the greatest views over Marina Bay. So with that in kind I was willing to give this place a go.The menu was great, lots of different food flavours, many of which were not very Italian, there was a curry on there for example but the food we had was delicious. The cocktails were great too and when we involved the GM the service improved but before that we were left with waiters who were really struggling with any kind of personality or individual service.We had lots of fun and it's a great place for a date. I asked to buy drinks outside in the amazing bar, they said I could order there and take them out but I couldn't buy there as they had no staff....you can automate many things in Singapore but unless they find some AI to bring drinks to you they can't automate this.....So we made several trips back and forth to the bar in the restaurant and the GM was fantastic and brought the drinks out where no waiter would come. The bar was cordoned off as it had rained hours before but that was an excuse not to serve there as it was dry and I took off the covers and we had the bar to ourselves with the stunning view. Perfect part of the evening!It has great potential but you need to sort out the staffing issues. The GM is not superman. He can't do it all by himself. The 4 stars for service is for him.I'll be back to measure change

A group of ten decided to visit the hotel to see the view and have dinner. Greeted by friendly hostesses down in lobby and sent to the 57 floor.elevator opens to spectacular view of harbor and that’s only the beginning.Food: Each of us had different meals enough that two could share.Baked clams, fresh little necks, omg the meatball,Main. Course rib eye, New York strip, lamb and chicken parmigiana.Ok a little pricey but not for these sophisticated New Yorker who enjoy great food and service.By the way Lavo is part of the Tao family in NY

Celebrated first day of Chinese New Year with a dinner at this new restaurant. Made last minute reservations and we're grateful for being granted one. While there is a attire policy, I'm glad the manager was brilliantly flexible on this special occasion even while some of us were smartly dressed in polo and short pants. Ambience: 9/10Fantastic view at night. The restaurant is huge with tables spaced out nicely. Music was enjoyable. Service: 9/10Other than the snobbish staff at Level 1, the service rendered was perfect. Every staff greets you with a smile. The staff that attended to our table was attentive, refilling our drinks promptly. When we ordered a 20 layer cake, she offered to slice them up for us to share. Kudos to the team! Food: 9/10Black cod fish - Very well portioned. Tasty. The crispy portebello is surprisingly good! Fillet mignon - Juicy and tender. Tasty. Side dishes: we tried the asparagus, mushrooms and spinach (done in both creamy and sauteed way). The asparagus is the memorable one!Chicken marsala - this is NOT an Indian cuisine. Do not expect it to taste anything like it. However, it's worth a try. Tender piece of chicken breast. Value & Price: 7/10Good things don't come cheap. Especially when the restaurant excelled in all 3 aspects (service, ambience and food). I'll definitely come back for it! Hope they continue to uphold the standard. I've got a feeling this will be a hugely popular restaurant in a year time.

For the price charged, you do not get value for the dishes. Except for the steak which is very expensive, all the other dishes were a let down. The chicken masala has no spicy oomph, You are paying for the night view of the city at this 57th floor restaurant
5
The ambience indoor is beautiful and mind blowing views of the city & sea. The staffs are very friendly. Shoutout to Cocktail Server Yulia, Bar-staff Ash, Outdoor Bar-staff Jimmy, Manager Jerome & Mr Frankie General Manager. Service is awesome, cocktails are unique & food is amazing!

Lavo Restaurant located at the roof of Marina Sand Bay, has an unbeleivable view of Singapore. First you should take a drink before your table is ready so you can enjoy the view much better at terrace. Be sure that do not go there without a reservation. After your meal, do not forget to have a taste of the restaurant’s special dessert which i dont remember the name of it but has several layers of chocolate and peanuts. It is impossible to finish it by 1 person so you should definitly share it and the taste is amazing! :) Request it from your happy and lovely waitor who makes the best service ever..

Ate here a couple of weeks ago while in Singapore pre cruise.Mainly booked for the views which were amazing.Food and drink were a tad expensive ( £10 for a bottle of peroni ) but food was very nice and you are paying for the location.The naughty surprise came with the bill, the extra 10% service charge ( all literature we read said tipping not expected in Singapore). We didn’t mind as the service was great until the server told us they don’t get it, Lavo takes it all.Very naughty!!!, just basically 10% more than the menu states your food will be - a Lavo tax??A service charge should go to the servers!!!!!Spoilt the evening at the end as felt ripped off and sorry for the waite
