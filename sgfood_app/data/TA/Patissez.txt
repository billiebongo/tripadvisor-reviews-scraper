Their monstershakes were more memorable than the food. The shakes are a little heavy though for one person. Definitely come here for the shakes.

Great service and ambience.
The burger that was highly recommended on blogs was over-rated. Was quite oily with oil dripping as i was eating.

The choc-marshmallow milkshake had this sweet toasted marshmallow on top of a sweet brownie. The milkshake liquid was ok , but the marshmallow and brownie makes everything too rich and sweet

Freak Shakes tasted horrible. Look beautiful and delicious but they tasted weird. Will not visit again.

Ordered 3 dishes: miso linguine which was a tad hard for my preference and could do with better quality prawns, cheeseburger was decent, hotcakes with fried chicken was pretty average but the hot cakes are fluffy enough.

I had a long Saturday and at 8pm, all I wanted was a burger and a beer. I got my order through deliveroo and the restaurant was actually quick to deliver, faster than than the announced 25-minute wait. However, they did not upgrade the fries to truffle fries despite the $1 extra charge and I had no beer in my order. I sent feedback but no reply from the restaurant, they left it to deliveroo to credit back the beer without any word of apology. The burger was decent, just that the service is bad

I recommend this place - not sure about other times but was great for a mid morning breakfast. Herb mushrooms and poached eggs on sour dough toast with smashed avocado on the side. Coffee was good also - probably the best I have had since moving to Singapore a week ago

A great atmosphere and clean cafe that has some great wholesome and healthy food. The coffee is delicious. A cafe I will be returning to again. The only thing that would lift the service would be if you were waited on. Other than that very small thing it's great

The mint & Nutella based Freak shakes were really different & outstanding. Apparently not as sweet as those back in Australia, toning down the sweetness slightly for the local palate. The breakfast & burger items were reminiscent of the good ones we tried down under. The lunch 1-1 & chope discount, & w\o service tax made the lunch an attractive choice.

I ordered the corn and zucchini fritters. It was so greasy and the avocado paste was too salty. Worst food ever! My children had the cheese burger which was again very greasy and soggy. The waitresses were indulged in their own conversations and rolled their eyes when we called them. Never going back

Pricing too high for the food, service was quite slow as well. However quality wise food was not bad.

I always come back for the nutella donuts! They are my absolute favourite! I would definitely recommend coming here!

I liked the cafe decor and the freakshakes were presented nicely as well. Great place for chilling in the afternoon.

Chill Aussie brunch spot to hang out at the new Raffles @ Holland. Loved the nutella donuts and bacon jam!

Food was average, not much crowd on a friday night. Most people were there for the Freakshake. Food presentation was much nicer than it's taste. Price is not expensive.

I have this place a second chance and glad I did. Located at street level in the new Raffels Medical building in Holland Village the cafe had great people watching. It's also a good place to get off your feet as the air con is nice and cool. But of course the main attraction is the food and coffee. I wanted a healthy lunch and roasted cauliflower filled the bill perfectly. It took 25 minutes to make which seemed excessive (would have been nice if they let me know when I ordered) but was clearly made to order. The cauliflower was cooked perfectly and served in a light miso cream and sprinkled in crispy onions and red chili flakes. ($9). My flat white came out right away so if you don't mind having coffee first I suggest getting a cuppa and enjoying the people watching and cool air while you wait. I'm skipping dessert but it's a specialty here. If you're so inclined you likely won't be disappointed. Interesting vegetarian options as well as non-veg. Lunch at 2pm was no problem. Also nice for a group, family or solo

While shopping at Holland Road I had lunch at Patissez, a first time for me. I ordered a burger that featured bacon jam, another first for me. The burger was good, although coming from a place in the US that prides itself on all kinds of hamburgers this sandwich was good but not exceptional. The bacon jam was rather interesting, and it is just what it sounds like. The atmosphere was very urban and energetic and a nice break from other places where I eat in Singapore. I would definitely go again and try something else on the menu

It was a special ladies' day out with a friend from overseas. We went to Patissez for the freak shake. I love my shake thick but the mint was not what I expected - there's plenty of shaved ice at the bottom which made it watery n diluted. We were pretty impressed with the service and the lady was kind to advise some of the shakes may have traces of non - halal ingredients. We still love the Freak Shake! Thank you for a wonderful creation.

Tried their panko chicken burger, the meat was tender and the whole meal was perfect! Along with the fries :) And please, please make sure you order their freak shake! We tried Pretzella, which was a nutellary super nutella shake, amazing! The sweetness was just right and not overpowering. Best to share for two :

We visited this place as we live nearby. The coffee is good and they even do latte art. To eat we had the burger which was a combination a a burger and scrambled eggs. The quality was okay too. But from the menue there is not one dish which would lead me to go back to this place again. There are so many places like this in Singapore
