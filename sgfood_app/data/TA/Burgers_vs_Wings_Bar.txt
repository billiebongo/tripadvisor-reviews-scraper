Burger taste decent, eventhough not overly special, but despite their claim of "No service charge", it's price reflect that the Service Charge inherently included (i.e. overpriced). And the Ala-carte Burger doesn't come with Fries nor Drink, which additional fries cost more than $5/6

Starving after a day of being dragged around Orchard Road found this place upstairs. Very friendly staff and fantastic steak burger deal at lunch. Good VFM.

This place is amaze balls!!! If you come to Singapore and not come to Bwb, sorry you haven't done Singapore. Right in the heart of all things beautiful in Singapore.
And Elmer is a super star!!

Burgers & Wings in Singapore is a must to stop over in Singapore! The miniature burgers are such tasty novelties but not to be forgotten after a mouthful. The truffle fries beats is thumbs up and the famous wings! More and most important as a service with extra miles is Meet -he is the man that looks into all your needs with a smile from ear to ear. really his name is Meet! Also thumbs up for Gilbert and his team who looks personally in all your requests....We had a great event for 26 pax and he personally arrange for every table and chair requested to create the ambience.Thank you all for a great service

That Peanut Burger is tasteless, the very worst burger that I had, and it's S$23.40 for just that, not worth the price. Staff service is terrible too, must be having PMS

Aside from selection of comfort food that this place offers, their happy hour/s is a winner!!! Yup, a winner :) coz they have different happy hour segments where as depending on the selected time/s of the day, they offer alcoholic drinks buy 1 take 1 or something else. Drinks wise, I can only comment on their house wine though coz my friends and I have only gone there for dinner. Their house wine (Terreza Malbec - Red) cost about 14 Sgd (45 per bottle, if I remember it right) and of course you get to enjoy two during happy hour :) Aside from the drinks perks, their food is pretty good. So far I've eaten bolognese seafood pasta, fries, buffalo chicken medium spicy, pizza, burgers and chicken in lime/mango...I'd say really good comfort food!!! Location is also very accessible, just at Orchard Central 11th floor. Nearest mrt is Somerset. Last but not the least, customer service is very friendly and accommodating. Like what I said, couldn't ask for more :) I've once gone there for a company dinner, too. Burger vs. Wings will also be perfect for a big group dinner as such. The place is spacious enough and prices in general is mid range. Will always go back to this place. Yum

Just had dinner here earlier today. Ordered Mozarella Stuffed Wings and Chicken Burger. In both mains the fried chicken was drenched with oil. Chicken patty in burger was a tad dry. Stuffed mozarella wings lacked salt seasoning, resulting in a somewhat bland flavor. Overall taste and quality was really disappointing. You can most certainly get better tasting food prepared at a better standard than this, at a fraction of the price at many many many other places in Singapore. If you come here for the booze, atmosphere and "view", I guess its somewhat alright. The food? Don't bother

It does what it says it does well.Enjoyed the burgers and the wings. They were really nice. Considering where it is located along Orchard road, i guess the prices are about right (between $12-24 for mains). The set up and ambience is nice too. I definitely would go back again.Keep it up

This is not a destination dining place. Pizza, chicken wings and burger all disappointing and overpriced. Inattentive service when place is empt

Charles was a star! Wings definitely won us over... it was all nice and tasty, finger licking good...

Burgers are nice, especially the peanut butter one. Just a bit too pricey considering you're paying 20+ dollars for burgers. And it only comes with burgers itself, fries must be additional add ons...but overall, the restaurant has great atmosphere overlooking Orchard Road especially at night.

30 SGD for a medium size burger and a bottle of water. In my opinion it's to expensive for an mediocre burger.
5
This restaurant is located in Orchard Central on the 11th floor. This bar has different special offers on throughout the day and night. There is also a large selection of burgers, pizzas and wings.

Had lunch with a friend who recommended it. Located on the 11th floor of Orchard Central, it has a nice view - although it was too hazy yesterday. The wide selection of wings literally blew me away - i love chicken wings and man, did i have a tough time deciding. finally we settled on the buffalo wings, medium spicy. great choice- it was superb! we shared a set lunch meal - pork hot dog - yummy! i love the sweet potato fries - they are just soo good. i found the garlic fries a tad too salty. the lemonade is nice - maybe they should have refillable drinks. the restaurant is rather but and it was rather empty at lunch time but that is really good. it's good to just be able to sit and enjoy and the meal. staff are friendly and we did not have to wait too long for the food nor the cheque. will definitely return to try the rest of the items

Elmer has provided a fantastic service and made for a very entertaining afternoon for my group of friends and I. Elmer was very informative with local tips on Singapore. The food was fantastic and the beers were ice cold. Enjoy the beef, but don't bring the cow home! ;)Thanks Elmer and Burgers vs Wings + Bar. Tom Brewste

My friend suggested to have lunch here and upon seeing the place, I dismissed it as just another sports bar. But I was gravely mistaken. We had the lunch special and I had the Kubota pork burger which was so out of this world, I was certainly not expecting it to be so tender (not an ounce of resistance as I cut through it). It was aromatic, a beautiful smokey flavor and it was just perfect. The appetizer and and dessert buffet gave so much value. Absolitely loved the papadum anf salsa. 17.90 for all that. Will definitely return!

It capture my attention to buy the voucher from deal.com as it value for money.First time trying at this restaurant, the service & food is excellence. Price is average for a cozy restaurant. There is an outdoor bar which you can chill while enjoying some snacks especially must try chicken wings & burgers (=^^=)I will be going back to try other menu & surely recommend to my customer & friends

Located @ a high floor of Ochard Central ( as i remember it was 11th floor) and u get a good view of the city outside the restaurant. Food was a bit pricey but it worth the cost, has a good variety of drinks. Service is exceptional

I was lured into Burger vs Wings for my love of both products and a food challenge and this place did not dissapoint on any level. The buffet addition is great, and innovative for food in this style of american diner setting. The 65 degree eggs were amazing, and the beer cheap and cold. The wings are a smackdown as is the Tyson burger. I couldnt have been more satisfied, dining KO for sure

We use deals voucher for 14.90 for a choice of wings, and buffet spread of tapas. Overall enjoy the experience, but will only consider coming back if they got the same promo again for burgers. http://saventravel.blogspot.sg/2014/11/burger-vs-wings-bar.html

Had the pleasure of attending a small party organized by a former colleague on Friday.First impression as you enter the glass door is, "Where is the party?" I was lead to a part of the restaurant which was apart from the main seating area.It was sectioned off for our event. Nicely done. The food was only "so so". We had burger sliders, pasta, wings, pizza, salad and desserts. None of the items shout out saying "eat me". For me the event was the highlight. The food was secondary. I am glad that my expectations was set rather low. So, I was not disappointe

good restaurant that i highly recommend, Elmer is particularly very helpful! Service was very good and the place was clean and all the staff are well represented, affordable prices and good quality of food for the prices given.friendly and approachable staff that have excellent customer service and suit all types of customers with their wide range of choice on the menu and are willing to adapt for people with disabilities and large groups

BwB is hands down one of the best beef burger place in Singapore. The place is pretty empty on weekends, so its quite an enjoyable gathering venue. The theme of the restaurant - fighting rink for burgers and wings, is also brought out really well by the decorations and random punching bags hanging from the ceiling. I got the Classic Heavyweight Beef Burger. Look at how thick the patty is. And its really juicy and reddish on the inside. Don't get the wings, its an open secret that burgers totally win the fight here. Full review and pictures at http://goingmerrily.blogspot.sg/2014/10/bwb-burgers-vs-wings.htm

First off the service was incredible! Five stars across the board!! Best deals ever drinks are great the food even better!! I've had lots of chicken wings and these are hands down the best! Ask for Elmer he provides the best service!! Burger vs Wings + bar is the best place to eat in singapore with one of the best views!

Happened on 17th Sept 2014 DinnerToday is my wife's birthday. I thought I would bring her to this place for some nice burger and wings. I am penning this while waiting for the food.The 2 of us was shown to a table for 2. As we felt we have a Lot of shopping bag we asked the waiter if we could have the table for 4 instead so as to put our bags but we were rejected. restaurant is hardly 10% full and the waiter told us to put out bags including my business bag and my wife's hang bag on the floor. We asked is your restaurant full? That's when the waiter put us to a table of 4. And the next shocking part is that 2 Caucasian couple were shown to the table of 4. When our champagne came, the waiter put down the glasses not before spilling one off. There were no apologies and when he came back with the toasters, yes, he put the glass first on the table then went back to get toaster.All along, I thought it should be toaster first then glass on top. He still didn't apologize or wipe the spills.Food came and really nothing fantastic when I actually ordered the wagyu beef burger and wings. As usual, no extra plates given for us to put the bones of the finished wings so we have it all on our plates.We put the sauces on the burger serving dish and when the waiter wanted to clear the items we told him we still want the sauces for the wing. So he put back the sauces dish and that's when he spilled some of the sauces into the basket of wings.He didn't apologise until we asked him that he spilled one of the sauces into our balanced basket of wings and shouldn't you replaced the sauces which is already empty? He apologized that he didn't knew but clearly when he spilled the sauces there was a spilt second the 3 of us were looking at that incident and I am sure he knew.NEVER GONNA RETURN TO THIS PLACE AGAIN. can't believe it makes a birthday dinner going so bad

Not sure what this please is trying to be. Lunch deal was cheap but the buffet is not giving you a lot and the size o the burger is minimal - this maybe down to the lunch deal though?!?!Seems the restaurant has not found its identity yet and is trying to be 2-3 different thingsFood is ok but nothing special
3
premise - its a nicely decorated resto and spacious as well, a very casual restolocation - triple one @ somerset so car park is dandy and MRT is just belowcrowd - mainly young people, some families but large group would be beststaff - all their names are SMILES. :) very polite and interactive staff.food - tbh, its OK. it's not to die for burgers but due to the mini buffet that it comes with, it makes value that little bit betterverdict - come if you want to try and happen to be in the area but not really a must. and i went there when they had an offer in groupon so..... :

Burgers vs Wings + Bar is one of those fusion places that try to carve out a niche in an already saturated market / trend of posh burger places. The difference is in the equal focus in the menu on (chicken) wings and the introduction of an all-you-can-eat tapas buffet which is an add-on for $7.90.Eschewing the burgers, I decided to try the wings instead. I can't remember the name of the wings I had, but it was partly stuffed and came with a butter sauce for dipping which reminded me more of the Singapore McDonald's curry sauce. The tapas buffet was novel at first and had a reasonable range, but most of the food was cold and if you're not a big eater, you'll be done in a round or two.All in all I have to say that nothing really stood out to me and I would be hard pressed to find a reason to return

Went for a meal at BWB one early evening. The restaurant specialises in wings & burgers.Did not try the burgers but ordered the signature heavyweight & buffalo wings. Both were passable but nothing that stands out. I had better hot wings at Hard Rock Cafe.The salad & dessert buffet add- on for $7.90 was pitiful unless you like poppadum, corn chips & pop corn.The vanilla ice cream turned out to be corn ice cream.Great view though & service was prompt....If you are in Somerset area for a limited time suggest you spend your time and your money on Emerald Hil
