This stall is run by 2 elderly couple. You can see that the guy doing the cooking has been at it for very long. It's old hawkers like them that cooked the best food. And gives good value too.We bought 3 items on takeaway - Hongkong Noodles, Fried Bee Hoon with cockles & Fried Kway Teow Mee with cockles( we asked for No cockles to be added).Verdict: Well, all 3 items are good & very nice. However, we ate the Fried Kway Teow Mee earlier at stall 91 Fried Kway Teow Mee( at level) & feel theirs is better than here.There are other items here which looks good & we will try in future visit.
