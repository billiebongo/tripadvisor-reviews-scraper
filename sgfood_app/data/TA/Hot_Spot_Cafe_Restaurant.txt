Very pleasant, reasonably priced meal this evening. Shared roast pork and chili, beef with ginger sizzler and mixed fried rice. We ordered the small portions of all three but was plenty for us

Stingray was super spicy and delicious. Lemon chicken also very good. Friendly staff. Lots of good on the menu, wouldve liked to try the chili crab which was half of chinatown price.

It would be easy to overlook this place, but the food is outstanding. Particularly good were the mussels, scallops and asparagus, and the pineapple rice. Very good-natured service, and they kept the beers coming.

Very good local place, serving local food at reasonable prices. We went here a couple of nights as our favourite restaurant-Fatty's -was closed for Chinese New Year. The service here was very good and the choice on the menu was extensive. This place is popular with locals and visitors and is easy to find as it is just off Bencoolen

`We had two little children with us and were staying at 175 Bencoolen Residences so we needed a close restaurant. Well this was a great choice. They were Kid friendly and the food was excellent. They were prepared to make things w asked for whether on menu or not. The ladies loved the kids and kept them occupied. I went back the next night for a few beers and they remembered me and were very friendly. Great food GREAT cold beers an at a reasonable price. The beers were especially inexpensive.

Put this restaurant on your must-visit list! I lived in Singapore for 5 years and came here at least a couple of times every week. I'm just in town for a few days this time, but happy to pick up where I left off.Hot Spot has a fairly extensive seafood menu and its *All* good. Reasonable prices too, not the extortion level pricing you get with the high profile tourist traps.One of my standard favorites is the traditional fish-head curry. Top quality fresh snapper in a rich yellow curry base with eggplant, okra, and onions along with just the right amount of chile. You can set the heat when you order: mild, medium, or pro.They also have a full selection of other local-traditional seafood favorites. Crab too, big ones, steamed simply or with the locally popular red chile or black pepper sauces.If you have a non-seafood lover in the group, no worries; there are plenty of beef, pork, chicken and duck entrees to satisfy all tastes.Side-walk seating or air conditioned interior. They have a lady whose only job is keep you adequately supplied with ICE COLD beer (and a decent price)!You are not going to see this place on a drive-by. Have the Taxi drop you at Sim Lim Square. It's an electronics superstore all the drivers know. Sim Lim is right beside Burlington Square. Hot Spot is right between them, in the Burlington Building about 100 meters from Bencoolen street. Once you find your way, you'll never forget

This restaurant is situated about a five minute walk away from the Village Hotel Albert Court its mainly used by locals. There are no frills but the sea food and curry dishes are excellent and inexpensive for example we paid 19 Singapore dollars for two delicious mutton curries and a large Tiger beer more than enough to satisfy ones appetite. We used the restaurant on a regular basis throughout our six day stay from here a five minute walk takes you into Bugis Street well worth a visit. Ask for the cheaper menu if you want curries

Ordered tom yam soup with noodle, soup is very tasty and spicy. All the seafood ingredients are there - shrimp, squid, fish slice, etc. Reasonable price based on city area. Tom yam sold out very fast, I ordered at 12pm, then later 1pm + sold out liao. SO be early if you want to try tom yam soup

We were walking around starving hungry, super hot, had no idea where to eat. Saw a sign for Tiger Beer and thought that will do. Had no idea what to order but got told the tom yum was best seller. It is a best seller for a reason YUUUUM!! It was so cheap, came in a very generous bowl, the prawns were massive and sweet, the chilli was quite hot but so damn good. This place has ruined me for tom yum as I don't think I will ever have a better one
