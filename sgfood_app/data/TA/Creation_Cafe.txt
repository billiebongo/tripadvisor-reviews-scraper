Came back here this week for another set lunch. Really quite decent value at $12 for a soup, pasta and iced tea. I was early so didn't have an issue getting a table, but it did get busy later. The seafood pasta was really good.

Another decent little lunch venue in the Beach road vicinity, this one located inside Shaw Tower. Good selection of pasta available at reasonable prices. I had the marinara pasta set lunch for around $12. Decent quality and friendly service. Definitely worth another visit.

I've been very happy with the quality of the food on previous visits and this time around, my first visit for 2018, was no exception. I again opted for the marinara pasta as part of a lunch set for around $12. Service was a bit slower than usual this time but otherwise all was good. I'll be back again

I have been patronizing this pasta cafe whenever I had the free time to do so. Basically this is the only place where I will crave for PASTA, especially their Laksa Pasta!All their foods, including desserts are done to perfection.Their mushroom soup is definitely one of my favourites! The pasta was done just right (not too soggy not too hard), the sauce was done just right (not too watery not too thick), the taste is real heaven! Their chicken wings are also fried crispy and yummy, but their dessert is most appealing - Apple Crumble with Ice Cream (for dinner only)!Best part, their prices are very affordable, even if you order the set meal, and they do not charge service charge nor GST

i have been having pasta here since the early 2000s (you cannot imagine it has been open since so long ago) , while the space of this mini-cafe is really packed and limited (due to its large group of supporters), its delish yummy pasta choices will definitely pack your stomach w feel-good factors....Its innovative creation like laksa pasta or thai pasta will make you drool for more...and its fried-to-tender chicken wings too...While it doesnt have a big name like michelin-rated restaurants: tim ho wan or andre restaurant, or it doesnt even look classy at all, it at least survived for more than a decade!with consistency....It deserved a michelin 1-star for that!Look how good another blogger reviewed it: http://eggylittlemelody.wordpress.com/2014/05/03/creation-cafe-why-i-will-never-follow-food-reviews-ever-again/ Note: No service charge and GST...this is an eatery nestled in culturally-rich and gourmet-populated Bugis area tooSo for tourists who are visiting Bugis, do pop-by this cafe/restaurant....(it is near to the National Library too)(Nevermind about its slow service at peak period, the place is small and the pricing is VERY affordable hence ...
