This, easy to find restaurant is very handy for the sports hub and national stadium. Being up one floor in the shopping Mall. Parking is 60c per hour right outside. The food and service is excellent. The crab and lobster dishes are overpriced (as is usual in most places in Singapore) but all the food we tried * was well prepared and delicious. The wine list was good and the prices reasonable (for Singapore). *Lobster & noodles with ginger Supreme black pepper crabCrispy fragrant duckWok seasonal vegSeafood beancurd Crabmeat and egg white riceChinese teas, Japanese beer were consumed along with the French white win

Went there for dinner before Jacky Cheung's concert. It was as you can imagined, full house. We waited 30 mins for our table. Ordered 3 simple dishes namely, fried rice, salt and pepper pork ribs and tofu. Actually, I would not rate them as very good but they were not average either. I wish there is a good rating option

The restaurant was awfully quiet on a Thursday night. It is classy but not overly stuffy. We didn't try their signature crab or lobster dishes, but I found the braised whole chicken and pork ribs to be average; the prawn rolls and lobster beehoon were tastier. Service from several wait staff was excellent. Probably will not return though.

If you are touristing around the Stadium, Joyden Treasures is a nice restaurant getaway from other busy food courts and restaurants. The cuisine could be described as Cantonese. The dishes had fresh ingredients, seafood and vegetables al dente. I enjoyed the special of fish in a tasty broth and the salt and pepper pork. The service was courteous and helpful. A good meal would be about $50 per person excluding drinks

The quality of the Chinese food, be it Dim sum for lunch or seafood dishes for dinner were really good when I visited in recent months! The seafood is fresh and well cooked, tried the Golden creamy crab and their signature mandarin peel pork ribs! The fried tofu with seafood is equally good! Service staff are friendly and responsive, attentive. For dinner on weekends, better to make reservations

Food: Above Average Ambience : Good Service : OkPrice : We spent $55/2 paxAccessibility : Very Near Stadium MRTLocation : Kallang Leisure Park, near Sportshub & Singapore Indoor Stadium. Parking: Within the Shopping Mall or URA Open Carpark. We walked past Joyden Treasures when it first opened but haven't tried it until May 2016. Decor was not bad. The vegetables dish was very good, so were the Char Siew Pows. However, we found the Siew Mai too soft for our liking. Siew Mai is usually harder but Joyden's Siew Mai was so soft that it broke into 2 pieces when I merely used my pair of chopsticks to hold it. Next, the carrot cake, Hmmm... you either like the texture or you don't. Its outer layer was crispy like hash brown. The traditional carrot cake is like that of Tim Ho Wan. You gotta try Joyden's carrot cake to see if you like it, it's quite personal, we prefer the traditional ones. The small pork ribs were not bad! My partner took the porridge and I only tasted a few spoonful. It was the gluey kind.
