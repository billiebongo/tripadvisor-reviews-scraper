A regular stop for my Latte Grande fix, couldn't be happier with the service and coffee. They had great giant size chocolate chip cookies too, addictive!

While visiting Singapore, we frequented this Starbucks quite often. The service is very friendly, the store is very clean, and the products are up to standards.

Friendly staff, quick service and good coffee. Plenty of space to sit and enjoy your coffee while using their free Wi-Fi

We had great coffee and cookies there and to go. The mall is huge and was just across a prime property that we stayed at with friends.
We had a wonderful time in Singapore.
