4
Easily one of the best Korean Fried Chicken Wings you're going to have in your life!! Love the Ganjang Wings!! =)
4
Best Korean Fried Chicken ever!! Love the Ganjang Chicken Wings!! The Garlic Soy Sauce is awesome!! =)
4
Nice food that they have. With desserts that we have enjoyed much! Portion of army brew is nice for 2 and in fact nice for 3 if small eaters
5
Excellent menu with quality food. The tokpokki with cheese is awesome even for someone who doesn't fancy cheese. Will definitely go back and they have a good range of alcohol as well
4
Simply the best Korean Chicken Wings!! Love the Ganjang Wings!! Fries was also very good!! Will visit again!! =)
4
Staff were friendly. Food was nice though it took quite a while to serve up the food. Felt it was a tad pricey for the portion. Worthwhile if you visit during promotion or purchased vouchers.
4
Love the Korean fried chicken. Nicely marinated and dip with special sauce. Also ordered mini bingsu which is really great, not too sweet
5
The food did not come after 1 hr and after checking with the staff, it was found out they missed the order. Free watermelon drink and bingsu dessert was given on the house for their mistake.
3
Topokki seafood was alright however there is too little topokki in it, the prawn was really small and it costs an arm and an leg. I purchased chicken finger set meal online and the chicken fingers have little meat as If half the meat was gone, although it is a promotion stuff. Is not worth to eat just so so.
4
Simply the best Korean Fried Chicken Wings there is!! I love the Ganjang Wings (Garlic Soy) the most!! =)
3
gd wings but onion was a bit small..
kid's meal was within expectation..
did not like the bottled water policy..
5
Food is good, the chicken was especially great. Also, the ambience and music there was good too, very nice place to chill with friends. Watermelon juice is also very fresh.
5
The set lunches are definitely worth it. Had the boneless chicken with bulogi fries. Very good. Love the crispy chicken wings too. Will be back!
4
Best Korean Fried Chicken in my opinion!! Very juicy & tender meat with crispy skin~ Ganjang Wings is my favorite~ =)
4
This is my second time at Chicken up. The first time was a buffet, it is definetely well worthed if you came with big groups so that you can share the side dishes and try the different type of the fried chicken! I love the yangnum fried chicken, i still can imagine how good it was!
4
Everything about chicken up is good. The early booking/reservation really ensures that you can just walk in without queue. Food's good and served hot, although a bit pricey, but the portion is proportional. Only thing that is really frustrating is the service of some crew members, very unfriendly in terms of explaining menu and promotions when we asked for clarifications. There's one incident when we asked for an extra order for set chicken with bulgogi fries but what came was chicken mayo and the service crew member claimed we pointed to this dish in the menu. Agreed that we should have been ready before order and not make the crew wait, but the whole process would be more efficient if she helped to facilitate because we were not very familiar with the korean dish names and the set menu
3
I was overcharged for the food initially. Overall, my experience was okay. The food standards have dropped. The soy sauce flavour is not as flavourful as before. But the service staff was not bad. She recommended us to try the sojurita. But I felt it was okay and not that value for money
1
Having a hard time explaining for using this Chope Voucher with the branch staffs. They insisted the voucher are meant for Chicken Wings only instead of the value for using in total bill. Branch Mgr attitude is unfriendly when knowing we are using Chope voucher. Sad for this experienced.
4
The menu prices may put some off at first glance but prices are not as high as they seem, because comparing with other chicken wing cafes (notably some new US style ones)1/ the wings are twice as big (ok, nearly twice), crunchy not chewy2/ rice dishes are value for money, one plate of spicy pork rice is a full sized bowl of rice and full sized plateful of spicy pork with salad condiments - the plate is good for 2 persons3/ watermelon juice is fresh and good sizeService is patchy but some staff do try very hard. But their manpower is limitedThere are a few more incentives to visit such as lunch sets and return couponsLastly they are just outside Century Square/Tampines Mall As it is outside the mall, they close nearly an hour later at 10.45pmDownsides - seating is limited inside, food menu is quite small and music is a bit too 'rough' for childre
5
Great dining experience, decent food and beverages in this unique restaurant with nice ambience, thanks.
3
Chicken up staff was unclear on the WOW sales and took some time to serve the food. When making payment, the manger even overcharge on the wings and had to void the transaction
4
Had lunch here with my family. The jabchae and mandoo soup were good as well as the soju drinks. The kimchi pancake was alright.
4
Thanks to Chicken Up's generosity. We liked the crispy bite-size popcorn chicken because they are boneless and skinless chicken breasts, which were being served in a large basket.
5
Can consider my 4 times visiting chicken up...me and my hubby jus love their specialty korean fried chicken wings, great!!
5
My 4th time here. They serve the best Korean fried chicken and food for youngsters especially. I will visit again. Please introduce more promotion!
4
Liked the sweet sauce chicken here! Think its still one of my favourite KFCs. Bingsu's a little too sweet though.
3
Ordered a Berrylove Potion (Alcoholic - grapefruit sake, $20 with 30% Disc) which was not too bitter and has a fruity twist, nicer than original sake in my opinion. Would recommend the $12 Ganjang Wings (Soya), flavor was just right and chicken was meaty. As for the YangNyum wings, would prefer it to be spicier and more flavorful, didn't finish this as I didn't really like it. Yangpa bomb (Onion - $12) was the bombz!! It is really good I can have all to myself, great for money too! Topokki with seafood was slightly more watery and spicy than usual Korean topokki sold outside, a little expensive comparatively ($20). Kimchi fries ($18) is not recommended and highly overpriced. Overall dining experience was pleasant though, comfortable dining area and staff were polite and meticulous.
5
Having visited a few times previously, we made a bee line for the outdoor seating as we didn't want to shout over the loud in house music.The ever amazing beef bulgoggi fries didn't disappoint. The meat complimented the fries and mayo ever so well.Then Yang Num chicken wings were excellent too - meat was tender and the sauce was not too overpowering.The mini mango Bingsu was expectedly so-so (as per our previous visits), we only bought it because it was half price with the student discount. We'd definitely give it a miss at regular price
2
Love Korean food, but this branch gave me some seriously sad chicken. The overwhelming taste of the soy chicken was old oil, and it wasnt really that juicy either. The other dishes we ordered were just substandard attempts at Korean classics and it just didn't work. I know lots of people like this chain, so maybe it was just a bad day, but am probably not going back to find out
4
The place was not full at lunchtime. Service was prompt, but we needed to request for items like the gloves. The omelettes had beef seasoning, which one of our friends couldn't eat.
5
I've always been here for the yummy ganjang chicken. Ginseng is not bad as well. Watermelon soju is good to share with a few people if you're not a good drinker like me. Overall good experience here
4
Ganjang chicken wings is a must try as it's so crispy and goes well with the soya sauce. The chicken wings despite being fried, its meat is so juicy inside!
5
I will recommend the soya chicken and japchae! Both are my fav dishes. Also the bingsu is quite delicious as well!
4
The soy chicken wing definitely is the best. The spicy wing is not bad too, just that it's too saucy. The spicy noodle, try it only if you can take spicy food. My lips was swollen after eating the noodle . Lol
3
Host did not arrange our reservation so we will arrange to split 2 tables and waited 10min for our seats. Food served was fast but lack of staff during lunch peak period.
4
The wings, kimchi fries, chicken stew & watermelon soju were good.
The fried onion was not so fantastic, a little too oily.
Recommend at least 4 person to dine in to try their varieties.
4
Yangpa bomb that we order was not fried well. Should fried for one more minute and easy for us tear and eat.
3
Craving for a chicken & beer meal & decided to try both their soya & spicy chicken. Good move to order drinks first as both the yangnyum boneless chicken & chicken wings are super spicy. We would have preferred a more flavoured but less spicy version like those served in other Korean restaurants. Service is slow but at least one staff is trying & did her best to attend to customers. This place is good for a quick fix if you are craving for Korean fried chicken, otherwise keep looking for some place better.
4
Went to celebrate my bro birthday. He n my parents love the chicken wings esp the soya version. Fingers licking. Ugly tang was only so so. Will be going back for more but next time will take the buffet so that we can feast on the chicken wings
3
Food wasn't fantastic. The food is over price not worth eating. The only food that is nice is their fried chicken wings.
4
Food was tasty. The gloves came in handy to enjoy the wings and drumlets with hands. The fried onion wasn't so popular with us. Kimchi fries were good too!
5
Visited again, same satisfaction as before. A good place for gathering of friends and family.
great experience, will come again.
4
Taste was ok. Not sure why there was a service charge. The food portion seems rather large for a average Singaporean
4
Signature chicken dishes are one of a kind. Good choice of korean food and hefty serving. Nice and cosy place to bring office mates too.
5
Delicious foods... Nice place.. dont have to wait so long.. good customer service. The placevis east to find.. limot of variety.. should go often...
4
Food was great and the ambience was nice. The bulgogi fries was the highlight of my night. Food was a little pricey though. Soju was on 50% off that night.
3
First time at this Chicken Up branch. Went with my parents (50+ years old) and they couldn't stand the loud music. Thankfully the staff acceded to our request to turn down the volume.Yangnyum chicken uses special Korean fried chicken seasoning and tasted authentic enough. (Background: I've lived in Korea twice before, for 7 months altogether) Pieces are big and surprisingly filling. I've missed 돼지덮밥 spicy pork with rice for a few years so I ordered that and it was alright, though I think the Korea University cafeteria version tastes better. This came with salad though it's not usually the case in Korea. Fries with bulgogi came with lots of beef and both my mum and I felt it was worth it.My grouse was that the service was quite slow. 1 waitress took our order and the adjacent table kept trying to interrupt and get her attention. After leaving our table she went to talk to another staff, then attended to the adjacent table and spent a long time there, while our order sat waiting on her notepad (we asked her while the customers were making their decision). Meanwhile a few other service staff were just standing around with nothing to do. The waitress should have passed our order to someone else first so that it could be processed. I hope training of the service staff can be improved so that it's more like the 빨리빨리 ("quickly") attitude in Korea
3
I made a reservation on Chope and when I got to the restaurant, they did not have any table. We ordered five dishes and one dish was forgotten so we had to ask for it and it arrived after all the others had finished.Food was good / portions are large - for small eaters better to share
4
Nice korean restaurant that serves korean fried chicken and other side dishes such as chap chay, kimchi fries and melon bingsu. Love the spicy up and spicy yanggum up as well as the kimchi fries and melon bingsu. Chicken sizes are really big and prices are around $20++ for each dish. A nice indulgence for special gatherings, otherwise will only visit if there are discounts or promotions going on
4
Fried chicken not bad, surprise for their watermelon with soju. The waitress is best, especially one of the lady, can serve all the customers although in peak time. Smiling all the time. I will feel satisfied if my restaurant have this kind of staff!
4
It was our second time and everything went well according to plan. Just need to have constant improvement and awareness to your surroundings.
Overall it was good.
5
Really nice fried chicken here. Together with soju and bingsu, you are in for a treat!! It might be a bit crowded during meal times but it is worth the wait!!
4
Went there as I got a treat. Renovation is special korean stlye.
Signature wings dish is juicy than my expectation.
Friendly staff.
Fries are fresh too.
4
I like Matcha bingsu so much.This is the first visit and just for desert, next time will try the chicken.
5
The best fried chicken I have eaten. Love the spicy and ordered 3 pieces of it.
Better to have some company going here so you can enjoy other dishes for sharing.
4
The staff by the name of Ann was very nice to serve us with the smile and feel so welcome for the first time. Good recommendations,excellent job well done!
4
reserved through Chope, but however when we reach the restaurant, the manager give me a blank look and did not find my name on their reservation list. So ended up we have to wait for a table. I am not sure how does chope inform the restaurant about our reservation, but disappointed
4
The chicken wings are equally tasty for both flavor. But personally I like the soya sauce one better. The flavor is strong enough and I feel that it's one if the restaurant that serves authentic kimchi fries! They really have the fries together with kimchi sauce and strips of chicken meat! The watermelon soju is strong if you pour the whole soju in. But it's satisfying! Perfect with the chicken wings. The macaroon ice cream is good too, the macaroon itself is not too sweet and the ice cream just adds into the flavor. I would definitely recommend eating if you don't mind the price. The food is a little pricey but if you care about the food more than price, then you should try! Sometimes after one try, you might have craving for it next time.
5
Heard about this restaurant but happen by chance to be at tampines to eat the Famous chicken up chicken wings, wow it taste great but sinful!! If you are trying to cut down on oily food, don't step in to the restaurant. But if you wanted to know how a good chicken wings can be, by all means order the 4 pcs dish and add it to your database of best chicken wings ever tasted!
5
First time here! Very good impression on service by Ms Ann. Warm personality & great recommendations. Excellent, food is nice & tasty.....a sure must come again.
4
Love the chicken taste here add in friendly staff who welcome us from the door and review foods order with us...will back here again
5
Excellent service from Joanne at Tampines brunch. I love Ganjang Chicken Wings n Melon Bingsu. We visit here every month after our salary out. Lol (kind of small celebration near the office)
5
The staff here are very friendly & very approachable. Food is nice and delicious. Atmosphere is good.
4
Ordered chicken cutlet and honey ginseng tea for lunch. The waiter will serve the food and drink quick. Overall Experience is Good.
5
I like the fries. And the chicken. And the rice. And the water. Serving was quick waiter was friendly. Good experience. I like.
5
Ordered some spicy chicken thinking it wasnt that spicy but it was THAT SPICY. But mood and atmosphere was good and the waiter was friendly easy to talk to. Had a good time. Now going to get the free watermelon juice.
5
Had dinner here , good thing is there is no queue as we came in and the staff was very friendly and nice to us. Offering ice water automatically. Had the peach soju which is awesome.a muat try

A popular Korean eatery located on street level od Century Square Mall. Be sure to make a reservation for a group of 4 or more cos it gets very crowded at around 7pm dinner time. my group of 7persons was cramped into one corner of the restaurant, hardly any space between tables. Of course they have outdoor seating area too but beware when it rains. Hahaha! Food wise, quite delicious. Watermelon soju nothing to rave about, we don't find it nice. The fried Chicken Wings comes in 2 flavors, ordered one of each which we find absolutely finger licking good. In fact we ordered a 2nd n 3rd helpings of the same.Try the Soldier Soup hotpot, I find it nice. The fried Glass noodle (Tang Hun) is not to be missed. Fried rice Korean style is nice too. Water is DIY from the nearby counter which makes SO troublesome aggravated by the cramp walking space between tables. Overall, the dinning experience was a little below standard, very cramp, price a little on the expensive side given the ambience n service are NOT that conducive for GROUP dinning
3
Generally the staff served without any smile and since its our first visit, we asked for signature dishes. A senior staff attended to us but didnt sound enthusiastic when she was recommending. We ordered a beef burger and chicken wing set. The chicken wing set arrived within 10 mins. Subsequently we ordered another 4 pieces wings and glass noodle. They both arrived within 15 mins. The beef burger did not arrived even after 30 mins. We spoke to 2 different servers to check on our order. The beef burger was only served after 40 mins. The beef burger was good with a 1" thick patty. Glass noodle tasted too sweet and I won't recommend this dish. The wings were equally good as compared to 4-fingers. As for the bill, it seemed that there's only that senior staff who was able to use the cash register while the rest of the staff were not allowed to touch; thus it took a while to settle our bill. Luckily the senior staff tallied our order against the bill as we were charged 1 melon bingsu which we did not order.
5
Yummy food! we were seated outside but the place wasn't hot at all :)
Staff was very proactive as they offered us ice water :)
5
Staff is very friendly and proactive :)
Great place for a small gathering. Ordered he wings and truffle fries it is delicious :)
Thank you!
4
Their original chicken wings and spicy chicken wings are a must try! Original chicken wings looks fried but its super juicy and tender on the inside. Totally warm up your stomach and lighten up ur mood!
4
Service was prompt. Got a seat after a short wait. Quite a good place for couples to dine together. Service crew are friendly and helpful
4
Good place to get chicken and beer. Their chicken flavors are deliciously interesting.
Friends will enjoy the ambiance and the food.
I would recommend that they mix their playlist with some english songs.
5
Thumbs up! Love the ambience here at chicken up tampines branch with my friends! :)
Will intro this place to many of my friends !
5
Smells good and taste even better. Good selection of items. Soup is tasty and just the right level of spiciest. Must try!
4
Good ambience. Great way to celebrate occasions. Loved the chicken wings. Spicy but sweet! Will come back and bring the kids here.
5
Just went to dine at chicken up tampines branch for the first time and the services provided by the staffs were great! Love the food here and the ambience of the restaurant. Would definitely return for the food again! (:
5
Staff were friendly and attentive. Warm and cosy ambience, suitable for a good meal with good friends and family.Food selections were wide and prices are value for money.Enjoyed our truffle fries and soba salad. Crispy chicken that we ordered were juicy and tender.Will definitely come back to try the other items on the menu
5
A fan of fried chicken and had tried others and chicken up soya ganjang chicken is the nicest.
Tried japchae, subak soju, kimchi fries. All are nice too
4
1st time having lunch with friends in chicken up Tampines branch. Good service and food though price is slightly on the higher side...
1
Excellent food and service! The chicken wings are fantastic, especially the crispy and soya flavour ones 😊
One of the staff Joanna has been extremely helpful and patient to our request!
5
visited this place with 2 of my friends. staff are very friendly and food is good. would definitely come here again with my friends.
4
staff are very friendly and polite. great food and shop is located in an accessible location. definitely worth coming!
5
A very accessible and nice location to catch up with friends and family, good food is served with very nice waitress and atmosphere
3
Went back there to try the Ganjang chicken wings again and find out there new foods added. Order Ganjang chicken wings, Onion bomb and Seafood Topokki. Like the spicy topokki with the rice cake.
4
Eating chicken with plastic gloves donned is like eating at home. I love their bingsus especially their soba salad. That's a double thumbs up! Beef bulgogi is same with other bulgogi i have tasted.
4
We tried once, bingsus are good. Their beer is hite and i love it! beef Bulgogis is tastes ordinary, nothing special. I just enjoyed eating their chicken in bare hands, oops! with plastic gloves don. i almost forgot! pls try soba salad! thumbs up!
5
I dropped by chicken up tampines today for lunch with my family. I loved the kimchi fries which is really flavourful as well as the spicy up half chicken which goes really well with their mustard! Ice water is complimentary here as well:) The service here is prompt & attentive,keep up the good work! Will definitely drop by again~ Thanks
4
Had a quick bite and 1st visit. Wondering what to order and the service staff was patient with some suggestions. Nice. Will return
5
Loved the watermelon soju. Goes very well with the soya fried chicken wings! Best type of food for an evening meal with friends.
5
Ganjang chicken wings is simply delicious (Thumbs Up).
Onion bomb is something interesting too.
Jane was patient with our family & meticulous with our orders.
1
Most menu items were certainly overpriced, hence I expected good food but Ginseng Chicken was average. Bowl given was not cleaned well with chili stains, changed one and still had chili flake on it but I didn't care already. Certainly will not visit again anytime soon, I would not recommend anyone to try the Ginseng Chicken either. Really disappointing experience.
4
Visited chicken up with 2 of my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed the stew esp when I was having it on a rainy night. Felt like I was having a home-cooked meal! My favorite would be the beef bulgogi fries because the beef was so tender- a unique combination of fries and beef bulgogi.
4
Chicken Up is perhaps the first restaurant to bring in the Korean Bingsu dessert to Singapore. The food selection is limited but most people would likely go for their top selling items like Bulgogi/Kimchi Fries, chicken wings, etc.On the downside, the MSG content is high in most food with gravy. Those with low tolerance for MSG best try to avoid food like their stew or cheese tobokki (anything with lots of sauce on it). Things to try is their bulgogi and kimchi fries and chicken wing with soy sauce ;o
4
First time to chicken up @ Tampines branch. 1st impression, the waitress was polite , the food was good except the one we had, spicy half chicken. Not much taste and not spicy at all. And of cos, the watermelon soju, is just like watermelon juice being serve with vodka shot. But it does goes well with soya fried chicken wings. But is a little bit pricey given that is a simple deep fried items with soya 
2
Wrong choice for my partner's bday celebration. Nothing special on the menu, except for the melon bingsu which was awesome, but still too expensive. The waiter was not so friendly and approachable, though the senior manager was nice. As for me, good service will still be the key factor on having a loyal customer
4
The first trip down left a reasonable good impression: there was not much of a waiting time and we were seated in about 15 minutes. The interior resembled that of a vibrant hip pub with the bottles of preserved fruits decorated the shelves near the glass panels. Condiments like sauces (e.g. chili and mustard) and plain water are self-service and free-flow. Whereas wet tissues, tissues and bottles of (complimentary) water (perfect if you have more than 2 in a group and saves you the trouble of having to get the water from the dispenser yourself) have to be requested for.We ordered the Gangnam Chicken Wings (4 pieces) as $12, Pineapple Soju at $35 and Spicy Crispy (Half) Chicken at $25 (I think). While the chicken was delicious, the prices were a little steep. The total bill came up to about S$70++. But to give credit, the chicken was cooked upon order, so it was served nice hot and crisp, bursting with flavor and juiciness. And the Pineapple Soju was full of pineapple goodness, complimenting well with the soju.On the second trip, we had to wait about 30 minutes before we were seated (it was a Friday night after all). Due to the packed capacity, we opted to sit outside. Service on that day was not as good as the first time: it took quite a bit of effort trying to get the attention of any of the waiters/waitresses to take our order. It did not help that we were located at a corner (outside) which might have been a blind spot for them, and made us feeling a little ‘neglected’ when they ‘overlooked’ us. There should have been at least one waiter/waitress on standby outside when the restaurant is at full capacity.The Melon Bingsu while delicious was very much over priced. I mean how much does a (whole) melon actually cost? What more half a melon… It’s just melon, ice-cream and (finely shaved) shaved (melt in your mouth) ice. If the (half) melon was slight bigger and there were 2 scoops of ice-cream instead it might be worth the $20.For more more about my food experience and for more photos here: http://www.travelbytez.com/2015/05/korean-fried-chicken-chicken-up-tampines.htm

How is it possible for this restaurant to serve fried chicken wings (4$/piece) - completely coated with fried battered - beats me. Serve in a shallow basket - nothing fancy, no garnishing, just dead fried chicken wings. 20 tables indoor and another 20 outdoor. At least 10 serving staff and another 8 in the kitchen. Just does not add up. Restaurant menu presentation, table with set cutlery and small buckets for bones, may be part of creating a rustic look - but the prices are way above rustic. Amazingly, there is queue to get in - A successful Rip - Of
5
Highly recommended for casual dates with friends. Very chilling and relaxing atmosphere. Food is fantastic, especially the chicken as its tender and juicy. Very polite and Good service from the staffs.
5
First time here at chicken up and was served by staff Jane. The dishes she recommended were above expectations. Had a great dinner tonight and will definitely be back!
4
Very very delicious chicken. Good service and very nice modernized environment. I'll definitely come again with my family and friends. :)
4
The chicken was good and delicious and the service was good . Although the waiting was quite long overall it was excellent.
5
Had dinner at Chicken up with my friends last night. We absolutely loved the chicken there, and also the impeccable service by Jillian! She was friendly and nice throughout the dinner and also super attentive :) Will definitely be back again to try more flavours!
5
Staff was very welcoming and friendly and helped us recommend their best sellers.
Food doesn't fail to disappoint!
Was served by Jillian and she was very helpful and warm
Would definitely patron there again :)
4
Veri friendly stuff service. Good place for family treats. Would recommend ganjang chicken wings and melon bingsu!
5
Visited chicken up with a bunch of good friends and had an enjoyable time! We tried some of their highly recommended dishes and were not disappointed. Would also like to make a special mention to their friendly staff (jillian) who was patient and helpful with our orders! Would definitely visit again! :
5
Visited with a group of friends and we ordered yangnyum and ganjang flavored chicken in the mega half and wings portion. They came out fresh and pipping hot. Very delicious and satisfied our chicken cravings. For dessert, we had melon bingsu and it was refreshing to have after the meal. We were served by Jillian and the service was good as she was very attentive. Would visit again
5
We have visited Tampines branch yesterday to celebrate Mother's Day. We ordered the mega half chicken and the melon bingsu. The food was so delicious. We love the bingsu it was so refreshing. We are been served by jillian. Attentive service receive from her. We will visit the restaurant again! Thankyo
4
Good service from Jane! Forgot the cheese on our seafood ttpoki and when we informe them they gave us a watermelon juice on the house. Quite good.
5

5
Nice and delicious food. The desserts here is must try. Served by one of the staff, Jane, she's very friendly and attentive to customers. It's worth it to come by again.
5
the food was good and it was made better with excellent service. pricing is a bit steep for students but it's a good place for catching up as the food are meant to be shared among a group of people! Overall good experience here! Served by Jane
4
Heard about this place from a friend & decided to travel from west Singapore to the east to try. The crispy & succulent soya sauce chicken wings were worth the travel. Freshly cooked upon order; big portions of 4 wings per order. Not enough to eat, can order the other Korean spicy flavour
5
It was my first visit to Chicken Up Tampines & I had a very pleasant dining experience with my family. Chorok greeted us with a big smile accompanied by her assistance. The waiting time was reasonable & the food was great. Will definitely make a return trip soon!!
5
Hi, I recently visited Chicken Up Tampines. I would like to compliment Azari for his excellent service!! :-) the food is also awesome!! Worth the visit!!
5
Went there to have a small gathering with my friends. Felt very homely due to staffs service. 2 thumbs up for a person named CHOROK. Best service I've encountered.
2
This place is way overpriced! Lunch for 3 without alcohol...S$80+ just eating chicken wings, pan cake and soft drinks.... You must be kidding!
5
Have tried their seafood pancake, topokki and truffle fries and all are so yummy. Have tried their melon bingsu too and its so korean. The service is ok and i give 10 out of ten score for this restaurant.
5
I have tried lots of times to be in their tanjong pagar. Offers same yummy chicken but the difference is, they offer desserts here. I super love the melon bingsu and the ice cream macarons. Reasonably priced and the service is great
2
The lunch set was 10.90, not worth at all. Unless there is super good promotion, else is not worth going there. The chicken wing skin taste nice, but not super nice .The popcorn chicken was not juicy. Is just super oily. When you squeeze them, oil will be splitting out
5
We went here to use Soya Chicken wings vouchers that our friend gave to us. We actually wanted to save money so we just make use of free vouchers. However, a group sitted next to us was eating this really huge melon and it looks so delicious and we ordered one too. They said that it is Korean dessert called Melon Bingsu. The taste was really yummy. Too big for 2 people though
4
Had to give it a try since always saw long queue for dinner time.We waited a while but we're inform if we sit outdoor w/o aircond, we can have a table right away. Cool!Ordered the Gangjang chicken wings of 4 for $12 and a large pancake. Awesome taste for both. Highly recommended.Service : Fast and excellent.Ambience: cool with cooling fan at 26 deg CWill come again for sure
1
Two words- not impressed.Ordered 4 dishes (1 spicy fried chicken, 1 sweet soya sauce fried chicken, seafood pancake, cheese topokki cheese with seafood).  Felt a little disappointed when customers who came later then me, were already eating. It was after I made a fuss to the server, food and drinks came half an hour later.Overall, the food was average but overpriced and NOT worth the wait. Tasted once but not going back to this restaurant anymore

I bought Groupon vouchers for Watermelon Soju and Melon Bingsu as they were on a discounted price. Together with 4 other friends, we ordered those 2 dishes, soy bean fried chicken, rice cake stew with cheese and chicken stew. The stew is rich in flavour and sufficient to feed 5 hungry people as there are rice cakes in the stew. As for the watermelon soju, it is good if you want to try it for experience but not worth it as it was slightly overpriced. Melon Bingsu is sweet and tasty, but you have to scrape the rest of the melon meat on your own. Do plan in advance and visit the restaurant early to get a seat to avoid any disappointment or to save time spent on waiting
