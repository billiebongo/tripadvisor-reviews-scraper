It is hard to find a comfortable area in the CBD that serves good food at affordable prices, but Five Square does just that. They have a selection of Food and Drink stores from local hawker favourites to japanese/western specialties.

The restaurant is made up a bar, live music stage and a handful of food "stalls". This is the place to hang out in the evening after work as drinks go as cheap as $5. Simply awesome!

Five has a comfortable ambience for office people to chill after work. Great variety of food and drinks. Drinks start at $5 for house pours.

Came downtown to have late dinner with friends who work nearby. I was expecting a big crowd at 9pm, but Five Square was almost empty. There were only 3 stalls open. The food is quite tasty. I had the Kaisendon from Teppei Syokudo. The food is a tad pricey but it was filling and the portion is worthy of the $16 price tag. Thereâ€™s a live band and overall a nice place to hang out with colleagues and friends after work, especially if you want to chat and relax.

There are a lot of locals in this place. But even as a westerner or tourist you will be welcome!The food is good and the prices are quite good for beer and drinks.The service could be better. At first I didnt get the order system, lol.
