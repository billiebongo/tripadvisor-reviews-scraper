Can't here for lunch with colleague and order 2 pork collar rice. This allows you to add sauce yourself as it is bland.
The cashier will assign the table no. When one place order and make payment.

The $10 nett BBQ port belly is not bad as a lunch choice. Good portion with soft rice. Port is tasty also. Half boiled egg is a spotlight. Guess the portion is larger than yoshinaya.If lunch set includes a soft drink or juicy drink it will be better even a small size one as the pork rice may go flat after half done. Diners may need to add some flavor. Sauces are placed in front of the counter.The service staff never remind new diners there is free water served. I know it after reading the review here. Overall it's a good place to have Japanese style meal
