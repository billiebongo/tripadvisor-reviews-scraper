Located at the 70th floor on Swissotel St Stamford, this bar offers a beautiful and nice overview of Singapore city. Very nice hangout place for a couple, can sit towards the glass window overseeing the Singapore city. The food were decent and well cooked. Cheers

The staff was professional and well-mannered, and the bar was well maintained, clean and offers a gorgeous view of the city. You will be able to see Dhoby Ghaut, Fort Canning and Clarke Quay from where you sit. However, if you prefer the Marina Bay view, heading to the Equinox Restaurant just next door will make for a better choice. The range of selection for bar bites was small but sufficient and tastes good. Cocktails were delicious, and I would recommend Singapore Girl for anyone who prefers a lighter drink. Aphrodite and Butterfly will be more suitable for someone who has a taste for stronger drinks.My date and I were there in the evening to catch the sundown but felt that the rave was a little overhyped. Our recommendation is to come in the night instead when the lights are dimmed, and the ambience becomes much more romantic.There is also an area which we felt the service can be improved. On arrival, the staff on duty did not have my reservation details ready and required me to take out my phone with the reservation confirmation email. This does not feel very welcoming for a guest who's prepared to spend just for the window seats and have made a prior reservation a few days before in advance. Other than the above, this is an excellent place to spend the evening

Absolutely fantastic and unrivalled view from this bar! If you want to see a different side to Singapore opposed to marina bay sands and the financial district, come here. The bar allows you to view the west of the city from the 70th floor and if you come here for sunset the view is spectacular. The cocktail menu is of a good wide and varied choice and all drinks are accompanied by free bar nibbles (crisps, nuts etc. ). Of course you pay the price (approx $30 per cocktail) but the bar is very sophisticated and has a great ambience. Would definitely recommend for one or two drinks just for the view!

At the moment when we (4 of us) arrived at the bar, waitress has approached us to know if we were staying at Swissotel The Stamford. As we were walk-in guest, she told us that there is different in price.There were some seats at the window view and some at behind, thus, she told us the minimum spending for window view 157 SGD if we wanted to have a good view of city??!! There is no any guide/policy that window view table required a minimum spending. In fact, I have checked the review online, with various price given (e.g. 60SGD, etc). And we all were okay to order above 157 SGD.When the bill came, it was 197+ SGD (Snack was charged 18SGD), which is more than 157SGD. The waitress told us that we need to add another water/small beer around 20SGD so that total bill would be more than 200 SGD. Earlier her colleague told us the minimum spending is 157SGD, now changed to 200SGD. After explained to her, she said the earlier waitress was mistaken. Okay then, we ordered one beer to satisfy this. When the final bill came again, two beers were added?! We told her to return one beer because we only ordered one. She said she wrongly key-in and now can not be altered, we should pay for it. Seriously, it was her faults.Now she changed to another story “the limit should be 200++ SGD or you have to pay 20SGD for a window view, and 4 of you used 2 window views. Total is 40SGD extra, either take beer or pay extra???”. This shows how polite of your staff is. We expect one of the 50 best bars in the world to serve us with the equivalent services but it was totally unprofessional at all. We were totally disappointed with this

Were directed here by the Equinox restaurant staff as we got out the lift on 70th floor, found a window seat and the view was amazing and relaxing. But as soon as we sat down we were asked if we were staying at hotel, when we said no we were told that there was a minimum spend of $60 to sit in those seats!! So we had to move. We looked at the drinks menu and the prices were ridiculous, so left. No way could I justify that money for drinks, and away from the windows. Very disappointed really. U can go to top of Marina Bay Sands and get a drink for $25 and sit where u like, and enjoy the music and the atmosphere and view. I know where We will all choose to go!

This place lives up to its ranking as one of the best rooftop bars in the world. The views are second to none and whilst you are technically not on the rooftop, but inside at the top of the building, this is still a great place to relax with friends and enjoy some drinks while appreciating the view. Highly recommended
5
We spent a lot of time looking out over the city with amazing views. The cocktails were as good as the views.I can really see why this is one of the top bars in the world.The food on offer was really nice but we had already eaten.Free snacks were provided and enjoyed.A must visit
4
City Space is a great place to see a 3D map of central Singapore spread out before you. From the 70th floor, you can spend ages working out where everything is and spotting landmark buildings. The service is excellent, but drinks and cocktails are pretty expensive (I guess you are paying for the view and the fact that this is classed as one of Sunday Times' top 50 bars in the world)
4
This is a great place to visit to enjoy spectacular views of the city. Open to everyone, but be aware of minimum spend limits if you wish to sit by the window. Think of it as a kind of gently enforced management system for customers. It doesn't make the greatest of first impressions as a result. The bar was practically empty when we arrived, and remained that way for the time we were there. We were allocated seats one row back. ;-)The cocktails are excellent (usual hotel prices) and served with some crips and snacks should you want them. Be aware that the bar does not offer tap water with your order, (why was not made clear). You are required to buy bottled water instead. First time we have encountered this "restriction", and to be honest felt a level of flexibility is required here given the quality of the tap water in Singapore.The view will draw you here
5
Love this bar before Equinox but would also come here just for the bar. Cocktails are delicious and high end and the Moët promotion is such good value. Very comfy, smart ambience and stunning views.
5
We had pre dinner drinks here, views from the 71st floor, the staff were very elegantly dressed and they were very efficient and friendly. Amazing experience, would love to go back again!
5
Located at level 70, you get a really awesome view of Singapore. You have to spend min SGD80 to sit by the huge windows. Really nice ambience!
5
Wow. The view is absolutely stunning and clear from this height. You can see Fort Canning, parts of Orchard Road and beyond. Whip out your map for geographical reference. Having been frequenting Introbar (at the ground flr), City Space was a first time experience and I must kick myself for missing this experience. Just remember to charge your phone in advance cos you will be trigger happy to snap before-sunset and after-dark photos.For drinks, I was served by Minnie and her team. Minnie who was a trainee some months earlier at Introbar has been climbing up the ladder and is now 70 storeys high.She whips up some potent cocktails and will be able to recommend based on your preference. Cocktails are beautifully dressed up... too pretty to drink.All the team are well informed of their range of menu and will seek to assist and pamper in any way. The ambience is slightly dim, but that is only good cos you get to see the natural lights from the buildings nearby, lighting up the Singapore city space.(only gripe is... the smoking room is 2 flrs down... by stairs
5
This bar is on the 70th floor of the hotel. You don't have to be a guest to go to it but be advised if you're not, they won't let you sit in the best chairs looking out the window. Great drinks & amazing apps! Get the popcorn chicken

My husband & I visited the City Space bar for drinks & food during our stay in Singapore. We loved having window seats as the bar overlooked the Singapore skyline and the view was truly breathtaking. We enjoyed our chosen cocktails and the lobster pizza was delicious!

The Good:1. Great view of the city.2. Cozy seating.3. Nice ambiance.4. Good service.5. Nice music.The Not-so-good:1. The lady who answered the call I made to enquire about their timings, was rather rude saying that they close at 12 midnight on weekdays, whereas the bar timings clearly state 1 am. She insisted the last order was at 12 and bills had to be settled by then. I argued that that was unusually early as compared to most other bars, especially if their stated closing time was 1 am. We landed up nevertheless around 12.30 am and were warmly welcomed and served. Much to our delight, they were open, and there were at least 4 groups of people there too, and though they took our last order around 12.40 am, they didn't actually close till 1.45 am, which worked great for us.2. The seats near the windows are apparently reserved for hotel guests, or for those who have a minimum spend or some nonsense! I found this rude and funny given that there was hardly a crowd and they could easily have let the 3 of us sit by the windows. We did spend $160 on 4 drinks, but apparently that was not enough...3. The drinks are expensive, with no cover charge on weeknights.4. The ambiance and decor, though nice, is a bit too dark for the most part. In order to shove you out of the door, the begin to gradually brighten it up after 1 am. Funny

I enjoyed a few drinks up at the bar and was lucky enough to get a seat by the window. Prices are pretty normal for Singapore. I also had a dessert which was quite lovely
1
Visited this bar after dinner for a night cap...never again. $75 minimum spend just for the privilege to sit by the window, we sat at the bar and my chair was so wobbly and old that I had to sit very still. We had two drinks - one average gin and tonic with Bombay gin (nothing better that you'd get on a plane if I'm honest) and a double baileys on ice which was the most scant double shot I've seen in my life. Our bill came to $63 for those two drinks. Never again! Would not recommended to anyone, not great service, no value for money and a tacky venue...huge thumbs down!

I brought a high value client for an appreciation of the city skyline and a quick drink before moving on to our next meeting yesterday evening at about 6.35pm.We had no reservations and we saw two seats right in front of the window and asked to be seated there.Chris (Miss) who was serving us politely told us that the seats were reserved and offered us other seats.I explained to her that we were there for a quick drink and would be gone in a few minutes.She checked the reservation and informed me that the party would arrive at 7pm. I told her that I could guarantee that we would leave by then and she escorted us to the seats.Our orders were taken, drink and snack service were prompt.It was a few minutes passed 7pm. I was not aware if the party that made reservations were there but regardless Chris did not hassle us to leave. Seeing that it was passed 7pm, we left for our next meeting.Having worked as management with reputable companies where customer service and product quality is taken seriously, Chris did a great job by having the ability to exercise discretion and was polite and efficient all the time.She is definitely an asset to your team.Compliments to Chris and I wish her the best

Great bar on the 70 th floor so you can imagine the great views. The cocktails are delicious and the staff very friendly and charming. This is a definite visit when you go to Singapore

Lovely place to read a book or spend time with the your love one.
Stunning view of singapore.
Friendly service crew.
Tasty mocktail (mint lemonade)
Jazz music is very relaxing.
Thank you

Breathtaking view of Singapore, both by day and night, and well worth a visit. The service is good, although the prices reflect the height of the bar!
5
This bar has one of the best views in Singapore, especially at sundown when the sunset on a clear day is fantastic. The staff, led by the charismatic Raquel, are very attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is superb. We'll be back!

I was staying at the Marina Mandarin Hotel and changed to the Stamford Swissotel over the weekend. After coming back from and enjoyable drink at Raffles I decided I wanted a coffee.The only place for coffee was 70th floor, so when i got there I asked for a coffee. No menu was presented but I finally got a very small cup of coffee and had to ask for milk. When I decided to leave I was presented with a bill for wait for it.......S$18!!!No one can justify that... Not even Raffles!!!!!Give me Marina Mandarin anyday and they dont charge anywhere near that for filter coffee!!!The th

On 22 March we enjoyed a drink at City Space Bar prior to dinner in Jaan on the other side of the building. They have an extensive drinks menu and we enjoyed a superb view of northern and western Singapore. We were offered a bottle of Moet for $98 but we resisted and I enjoyed a single malt scotch while my wife had a G&T. It was a great way to start what was a fantastic evening at the top of Singapore
5
Arrived at the Swissotel early evening after a long trip; you just want to shower, change and have a quiet drink! Decided to check out the City Space Bar on level 70. Happily there is an express elevator, which goes to both City Space and its clubbier sister New Asia. City Space is a weird name for a swanky bar, but whatever. The view is indeed amazing, a wide vista of Singapore assuming the windows haven't fogged up with humidity (which did occur later in the evening). Most chairs and tables are positioned looking outwards towards the windows, which is logical, but does produce a slightly odd effect as you tend to be looking at the back of heads. Also a bit anti-social? Sitting at the bar can be a much better idea and you get the best of the view. Service is excellent (especially Raquel and Ruffa), and the drinks are well mixed although expensive. All very James Bond. Enjoy
5
This is among one of the 2-3 bars in swissotel the stamford. I have tried the new asia bar which is fairly new and just a floor above. The seating arrangement is what i found was the differentiating factor. This is more of a classis type and is pretty amazing. I tried chicken popcorns which was amazing and drink was pretty nice as well
5
City Space in Swissotel Stamford suggested by a friend of mine and I just checked it a couple of days back. Superb place on the 70th level, with simply breath-taking views of Singapore. Enjoyed a glass of Long Island Iced Tea and Rhum Me Crazy...excellent service. Affordable price for the view/ambience
4
The city view is breathtaking and mesmerising. We had a lovely time watching the world go by with background live music. The prosciutto pizza, tempura and calamari were quite nice. The cheese selection on the cheese platter was quite ordinary - could have served higher quality cheeses. The presentation with olives and sundried tomato together with apricots, grapes, crackers and breadstick was quite dry. Overall it was a lovely night and I will return again
5
Good place to chill after a stressful day of work. Amazing skyline view. Comfy atmosphere accompanied with soothing music. Excellent service by Raquel & her team (Angella, Chris & Ruffa).
Every penny well-spent :)
4
The waitress (Miss Chris Marie) was fabulously attentive. She kindly offered my partner and I the window seats for the view when no one came back for their reservation. The music was lovely and really worth the money spent for the ambience and the view.
4
City space bar is my personal favourite in Singapore.
Bar offer great city view from 70th Floor with cozy environment. This Jazz bar has live music also which is soothing to ears.
Food is bit disapponting though...
5
City space bar is placed in top of the Swisshotel. The view is absolutely stunning and the cocktails were excellent-
Made from great ingredients and liquids.
A pleasure to make a visit.

We were staying at Fairmont next door so decided to come out and check out this bar. View was great, were sitting right next to the window, had a couple of drinks and had the cheesesteak sliders which were really good. Service was really great and the waitresses were quick. Is a small very laid back space with lounge chairs. They also had some music entertainment which was nice.

Seriously ... This bar is the best example of "wasted potential ". Has a great/amazing view of Singapore ... So if you are looking for somewhere to take first time visitors to SG it's not badUnfortunately...management think that's enough ... Overpriced drinks (compared to similar venues) . Staff during off peak times are ok but as soon as it gets dark the attitude (see some of the other reviews) starts to appear . Atmosphere is terrible.Has the potential to be an incredible venue - get some Regular (daily) funky live music (or at least a decent soundtrack), sort out the lighting, upskill the bar staff ... And it could just be s cool place to hang out.
3
Giving this place 3 stars because of the view and cool atmosphere. Staff were rude and snobby as if they're working in some upper class expensive place. Note to staff: you're not, and being snobby doesn't make you rich either. You're not serving celebrities and the people looked pretty average. Make sure to make a reservation if you go, as all tables are reserved usually and you will be looked down upon if you don't have one. I did enjoy the variety and creativity of drinks though
3
Came here to have a chill out moment by myself with a couple of drinks then eat a bunch.Of course the venue is great (I prefer the bay side view from Equinoxe on same floor though).But Service: I specifically asked that I did want to have first couple of drinks before I switch to dinner. They pushed me to place the order in advance anyways (I am suspecting they wanted to check that I hit the 75sgp mark for a window seating). Of course, the two courses of my dinners came together after the first sips of the first drink.... Drink was good though (Brazen something with CachaÃ§a).Definetly do not eat there: snacks coming along with drinks are not good for the price.First course a medley of dips (humus, ...) came with crackers overdue.Satay (local kebabs) are better in any hawker place for a fraction of the price.So my advice: go there for a couple drinks, enjoy the view and go to the nearest hawker place or chijmes just below for dinner. Or try Equinoxe so you change view. I have not eaten there though

Took my parents on our final day and we were not disappointed. It opens ats 5pm and has Happy Hour from 5pm-8pm. Beers-$9, Cocktails-$22. Great view plus staff very attentive. This is a must stop location as the sun sets or for just a catch up. Take your camera for great shots plus staff are happy to take group photo
5
They are located up on the 70th floor of the Swiss hotel. The drinks are a little pricy, but they have an amazing staff led by the manager Raquel. Chai chai runs the bar on her nights off and is amazing as well. All in all, a place a frequent everyone I'm in Singapore.
4
Good place to have a drink and start the night off.
Yes drinks can be expensive, however the view is fantastic and the staff are nice.
5
Came here for drinks on a weekday. Had to call in for reservations to ensure that we get seats facing the window. Minimum spending of SFD100 for 2 pax on weekdays and SGD100 per pax on weekends. The view of the city is breahtaking. Ceiling to floor windows offer limitless views of the city area and beyond. Had 2 cocktails, 2 snacks, and 1 beer for a total of SFD107. Happy hour between 5-8pm is best time to get very reasonably priced alcohol for such amazing views. Can be a tad pricey but given the mesmerising views, it is worth your penny. Staff polite and efficient, remembers you by name and all smiles
5
What a gem of a bar. Knockout views. Very very extensive drinks list. Quiet on certain days. Absolutely unbeatable drinks prices in SG, especially so during their happy hour"S" !Good service, very friendly and unpretentious......again a rare combination.For the gentlement, good cigar list with again, excellent prices, and a cosy smoking room to indulge in same.This place is a must visit for a sophisticated, quiet drink in SG

Was there with 2 friends celebrating birthday for 1. The staff were very friendly and attentive. We had arranged for a birthday cake with the bar and they got the performer to sing the birthday song for my friend. The happy hour charges were decent for some drinks. We requested for a seat near the window and pls note that the min spending must be s$120 above. Suitable for small group. If it's a big group, it will be too noisy and will disturb the couples in the bar. It's was an enjoyable night for us
5
It's actually my favorite sky bar in Singapore and I usually bring visitors there. This place is more quite lounge with soft music and live band. The sofas are comfortable and you get to view Singapore with high ceiling glass. They also serve some food such as caviar, sushi, sandwiches etc. drinks are good too. It's located in the 70th floor. You can reach the nearest mrt train station which is city hall and it's right on top. Entrance is by the hotel. Highly recommended
2
Atmosphere and the services were good, but not enough to offset outrageous price and mediocre quality of drinks.The price of drink is equivalent to that of the most expensive metropolitan five-star hotels. I always order Dry martini and Gimlet at first visiting bar for comparison.Dry martini was completely diluted by melted ice, and Gimlet was not shaken, instead served with bunch of floated ice cubes. As Dry martini and Gimlet were not listed on the menu, I designated SGD18 of Bombay Saphire as gin base listed on the menu to prepare each cocktail. At billing, this mediocre barman-craftwork added SGD 7 of surcharge on top of already-expensive gin base.Unless the quality of cocktails can be refined, it would be fairer to charge for table or music separately to moderate the price of cocktail so as to deserve its quality
4
Went to this bar as it is one of, if not, the tallest buildings in Singapore. The chairs are a long a row just in front of the panoramic windows which gives you almost a 180 degrees view of Singapore. I can only recommend to go and try it out. I was very satisfied with my drinks but what can also go wrong making a Capihirina
5
Personally, I had a great experience here. We came here at night,so, as a foreigner and tourist, loved the view. Yes, it was expensive, but we expected that since this is a nice hotel, and the bar its famous for the views. Also, loved the big windows,floor to ceiling.They had an special on the champagne, one bottle for $80 SGD. We never have treats like that in a bar, but we take the offer and enjoy the champagne. Also, snacks are complimentary (nuts and fries). After champagne, we had cocktails, which were handcrafted and delicious.I recommend this bar if you want to splurge a little,sipping a cocktail with a view
2
I just moved to Singapore six months ago and had heard so much about the swisshotel that when my mom came to visit, I thought it would be a great place to bring her. As it is the tallest hotel in Singapore, I thought she would really enjoy the view. Since the view was all we were after, we settled on having hors d'oeuvres and a glass of wine at the city space bar. We were ushered into the bar and while the music wasn't great, the service seemed nice and the view was okay (I say okay because it was not of the marina). We ordered a glass of wine for 33$ and when we asked for a glass of water to accompany our already expensive drinks, were told we could not have tap water, but that we must order a bottle of evian which cost 9$!!! While I was annoyed, I was not going to let this bother me as I was expecting higher prices, but when the food came, I really got upset. The 32$ "Greek Mezze" was a small smattering of mediocre hummus and goat cheese, with rice puffed chips that you can buy in any grocery store. The 22$ risotto balls were a poor man's mozzarella stick and the rock shrimp was obviously anything but fresh (24$). After living in Singapore for 6 months, I have never seen such a blatant gauging of prices for less quality. In a city full of roof top views and 20,000 restaurants, this bar is clearly betting on the one-time business traveller with a company card. To add insult to injury, AFTER paying the 164$ bill (which was completely unsatisfying), when we exited the elevator on the ground floor, the lobby bar was serving almost the same menu and definitely the same wine for 13$ cheaper PER ITEM!!! It made me feel like a total sucker. I had reasonable expectations for a hotel that gets so much hype, but I was really disappointed and will not soon go back. After experiencing some of the wonderful cuisine and bar scenes that singapore has to offer, spending 164$ in the city space bar made me feel like a chump
5
These are the most breathtaking views of singapore I have experienced. I went up on a Saturday afternoon only to find they have happy hour between 5-8pm. So not only do you get a private lounge with 270degrees of amazing views, few crowds and of music on a Saturday. You get bar snacks with your drink (spicy nut mix, crisps and almonds) and the best part is the cocktails are not as overly priced as other venues.perfect for a quiet sundowner or intimate date before hitting new asia bar for some late night good music.i could come here every day
4
It feels like a classic bar lounge with a magnificent view to boot. It's just unfortunate that some guests are dressed rather poorly un-befitting such a nice place.
5
Finished our full day with a couple of drinks overlooking the West of Singapore from 70th floor.
Fantastic window table, great service, nice selection and background music.
Pricey but we looked as it being inclusive of "admission fee" and thoroughly enjoyed the night time viewing.
5
One of the best locations for a drink with style, some piano music and a stunning view over singapore. Dress code applies.
4
Its position at the top of the Swisshotel Stamford sets it aside from most bars in the world in my opinion, not crowded beautifully appointed, good security a superb view and will not fail to impress, try it, if you can get in....
4
This was a lovely and stylish surprise. Part of the Equinox complex, the City Space has a relaxing after-work vibe and suits older tourist and those who like a laid back ambience kind of bar. Pricey but very good in happy hour which goes from 5 until 8pm. A tip: It doesn't face the Marina Bay so you won't see any of the laser light show. However, you will be served a classy trio of snacks with your drinks - olives, flavoured almonds, potato chips - and the experience is lovely with a to-die-for view of the city. Excellent service and very professionally mixed drinks. I'd give it 5 stars except the prices are eye-wateringly, Ventalin-inducingly high

After our champaign brunch at the equinox we continued with a nice afternoon at the City Space Bar for more bubbly. One of our friends was unable to consume anymore alcohol and asked for a cup of coffee. We were told it was S$18/- a cup! She then asked for a glass of water and was turned down, finally because she was feeling dizzy, she got a small 330ml Evian which we checked later costing S$9! When you have a group coming and spending on champaign and other cocktails, some leeway should be provided. I don't see why she was not offered a glass of water and a smile. Yes, we would defintely go back as one of us a a member and we do like the 70th floor ambiance but I think management need to look into this. Its just a glass of water!Lets be honest, the City Space is great because of the ambience

I have lived in Singapore for over 30 years. My friend and I had reason to want to go somewhere special to talk and have a quiet drink after dinner so we chose City Bar. Everything started off OK, the waitresses were attentive and sweet and we ordered a bottle of champagne. It was a little shabby and we were next to a sound speaker which had terrible feedback and the volume was much too loud but, OK lah we forgive that because the view was great and we were willing to pay nearly 100 bucks for a drink in order to have a quiet, anonymous place to chat. But then we realized: It was a Thursday night and the staff had decided they wanted to go home. If this had been any other country in the world then the staff would have just cleared up around us and let us hang out until we left. But no. This was SingaporeAt 12.30 am the lights were turned on so brightly that my friend had to put her sunglasses on. Then a very burly, intimidating bouncer stood behind our table (we were two women) and bullied us so much, saying "we are closing you have to leave now" that we left a third of our bottle of champagne unfinished and left the place. We got lost on the way out--it's a bit of a labyrinth up there--and couldn't find the elevator. We bumped into the bouncer guy in the corridor and instead of helping us, he sniggered at us to his colleague. There are a lot of things to say about Singapore service these days. City Bar epitomized the worst of this. The (non Singaporean) staff earlier were delightful.. But my memory of the place was being made to feel like the Singaporean "bouncer" guy couldn't get us out of there fast enough.Disappointed

We were staying at The Stamford so had to check the bar out. Went there twice and on the first night got a table by the window - the bar is small so limited window side seats. Live music was fantastic by a man and woman. Bar was well laid out, comfy chairs and fantastic drinks menu - this place is cheaper than Raffles Long Bar (Overrated) and Marina Bay Sands. The views are amazing and the drinks were very nice - not watered down and fairly priced ($20-$30). Perfect way to end the evening around 11pm. Came back 2nd night, couldn't get window seat but still great atmosphere. The women working here are very cute, well dressed, well spoken and were willing to chat and provide insightful knowledge about the area when asked. Excellent
5
I absolutely love this place, the views are stunning, the staff are amazing and the music is great, first came here almost a year ago while staying at the Swissotel, was here almost every night for a week, came back to visit once in May and was still welcomed by name when I came back in December. A must visit place if you are staying in Singapore, just be aware that if you are not staying at the hotel there is a minimum spend if you want a table by the window, but it is more than worth it for the incredible views. Otherwise you can sit at the bsr and talk to some of the best bar staff on Singapore.
5
Small bar on the 70th floor of the Stamford Hotel. Views are great and the space has a feeling of quiet sophistication (with prices to match). Happy hour runs from 5 – 8 pm when cocktails are $15. We had a very nice Singapore Sling and an even better Manhattan. If the window seats are full ask to be put on the waiting list to move when one becomes available. Apparently there’s a $60 minimum spend in the window seats, not hard to reach even during happy hour
