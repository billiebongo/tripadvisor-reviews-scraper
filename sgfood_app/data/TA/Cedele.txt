Lousy and expensive vanilla hazelnut milkshake. $8. Using a very ugly cup. Not much hazelnut taste. Too sweet .....

If you have been overdoing the Hawker Markets and just fancy a sandwich (it happens) then this is a good place to head for especially if combined with a shopping trip. Soups, breads and a great situation to people watch.

Went to this place with my family for the very first time. Nice and cozy place. Tried the banana expresso cake and lemon and orange cake. It was amazing. Also recommend the Egyptian mint tea!!!
Verdict: the tea and cake blend well.

This "coffee house" chain sells average cakes and coffee. Service varies from branch to branch.
Good standards are consistent. Average.

I went to have an afternoon tea at Cedele. Tea plus a slice of chocolate matcha cake. It was yummy! Staff was very friendly and helpful. Cedele at parkway is always a nice place to hang out.

the breakfast set is always made fresh and the flat white is not that bad either. breads are always toasted to perfection and the servers are fast and prompt.

We always buy our cakes from Cedele. Must have cakes are: Walnut carrot and blueberry cake. The price though a bit on the higher side but the taste compensates for everything.

For excellent local cakes and bread Cedele is the place to go in Singapore. While many will do the international thing and go to Starbucks, Cedele is both different and being a bakery as well (not every store has a bakery) does some really good cakes, bread, and other stuff (in most stores). Fully recommend it - some stores look better than others I have to say though

It's the place to be when you enjoy gourmet bread - a great variety and generous. Great accompaniment of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Staff don't overlook your shoulder - showing trust. Staff are quite helpful. Just a bit cleaner to keep away some of the small flies would be an added advantage

The Good:1. Decent menu2. The second of 2 Cedele outlets in the East.The Not-so-good:1. This is not a full-fledged restaurant and doesn't have the full menu, so don't come in expecting that as I did.2. Air-con ducts seem to be placed right overhead and directly above all the seats.3. The cashier and order area is quite cramped.4. It's located in the basement and hence it has no views and average ambiance
