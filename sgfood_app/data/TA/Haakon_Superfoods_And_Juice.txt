Decent portion sizes, loved the salmon and avocado. While the acai bowl was smaller than expected it was also much tastier than we expected! Definitely worth going for an occasional treat / pick me up.

Stopped here for tea and had a smooth Acai berry and a Mjolnir. They both tasted great and were very very fresh.
The quality of the ingredients is very high, but I think they still charge a bit too much.

Visited the outlet for the famous acaiberry dessert. Great flavours and prompt service. Must drop by after a nice meal at Holland Village.

Tried this eatery just below my gym. Plan to be a regular from now on. Food is delicious! Service is friendly and fast. Place is new and tables well spaced out.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed our chicken super salad and smoked salmon eggs benny for lunch today!
The highlight was the juices: Rise and shine and the acai detox. Delicious!

I went to Haakon especially for their smoothie bowls. The bowls looked amazing but unfortunately the base was so cold that was impossible for me to eat it. If you prefer crushed ice, this would work but is definitely not creamy as it is supposed to be. I complained and returned the bowls but the staff didn't prepare a new one for me. They replied that all of the fruits are frozen so they can't do anything. They didn't suggest any other option which was really disappointing. Didn't really care if I'm happy or not. I left without eating it.

Acai Classic bowl is the best!! The bowls are very healthy and you can tell that the acai is fresh.Always ensure the acai has a bit oily texture form the natural fruit as it shows it's not processed! Haakon just needs to change their paper bags for take away as the handle always breaks.Enough said!

I am persona;ly a healthy eater and love salads. But I must say the quality of the salad and food here is below average. I had the avocado bowl which came with an awful red hummus with a spicy sour taste that left a horrid after taste. The cucumbers should have been kept fresh but instead were served preserved with some sourish vinegar which taste awful. My husband had a dish with a sous vide egg and guacamole, tasted plain and so overpriced for the ingredients. Won't recommend this place at all. I think if a place wants to charge premium for salads, at least make it hearty, time for the owner to have a look at the fantastic spreads offered in Australia even in a regular foodcourt beats this place anytime

This place is on the B2 level of Orchard 313 mall. The salads are fresh, smooties and juices are also tasty. One thing is that the place is pricey and the staff is kind of a slow. However I still recommend for those who wants an alternative eat for a while

Super Super disappointed with haakon today , I usually love going to the Holland Village outlet as well as the Orchard branch, but today really shocked me, considering I'm a regular loyal customer whom always recommends this place... the last time I even took 10 friends all at once there for lunch!! So will not be going back after today...I ordered the smoothie... as the smoothies are not very thick because they don't use frozen bananas I asked to opt to frozen berries instead aiming to have a thick smoothie... I usually have vanilla protein inside, so asked what flavour they would recommend the actual "owner" recommends the berry... anyway once the smoothie arrived... it tasted horribly sweet... enough to make you feel sick... even my Friend and the actual owner said it was very sweet... but out of courtesy and aiming to maintain good regular customers the owner did not even recommend to make me another one with the vanilla flavour... I only had two sips of the smoothie and gave it back to them... they took it back but offered nothing... not even a refund or a voucher ... he offered to dilute it... well NO I don't really want a diluted smoothie thanks!! Just feel that me as a customer does not mean anything... so why bother going back... secondly disappointed when the owner said yes he tasted some and it was very sweet... must say something right... anyway... I paid extra on TOP of the normal smoothie price for a scoop of protein powder and berries... $9 odd dollars to throw away!!! I could not drink that sweet drink unless I wanted to get a migraine...
