Discovered this place by accident. Decided to try as it was busy with locals. I am glad we did. Yummy. The udon was yummy too. Portions were good size. The staff were amazingly friendly. A must try.

My 2nd time eating here! Love the quality tempura ! Portion look small but is really filling! Great price !!
5
Expect a long queue and the recommendation is to start queuing earlier or go just before the shop's closing period. Food was great and portion is big! Very value for money. Do try the udon as well as it is quite tasty! Highly recommended!

Visited the place on a weekday at around 11.30 am.. a few people are already in the queue.. we waited for 20 minutes (which is actually quite short waiting time) and we got a table. We ordered their signature tempura with rice . The sweet sauce that went with the tempura is addictive & delicious. The tempura is not dried at all. The rice is fragrant & delicious. The portion is big & it is really filling. Price is reasonable & we are greeted with friendly staff. We’ll definitely go there for more rounds. Highly recommended!

I rated this outlet as very good as I was left satisfied, after being hungry for an extended period of time (queuing outside the restaurant).Ambience:Small, intimate setting; typical of Asian restaurants. Open kitchen concept so you can see how they prepare the food.Food:Huge portion. The contents are all fried and the tempura batter is good. The sauce that goes with it makes it delicious. While I am not a fan of tempura style food, as it is overly oily, especially when you can taste the oil oozing out of the food as you chew. To be fair, that is where the sauce makes it all better.Service:Unremarkable; nothing good nor bad

Came here right after opening in the morning and was spared a long wait in the queue. They only allow you a table when everyone in your party is present. The portion was huge. I opted for mixed grains and I could not finish it. The ingredients were fresh and for the price I think it was a very good deal. The tendon cost $15 but with service, tax and tea came to about $20 per person. However, I found the tempura a little too oily for my liking, perhaps compounded by the size of the serving. Talk about a double edged sword. But all in all I enjoyed my meal there

I've always seen long queues at this restaurant and wanted to try it. We were there at 1130am and there was a long queue. We had to wait 20min just to get in even though there were plenty of empty seats. They were managing the queue to give the impression that they are popular. There were plenty of wait staff standing around doing nothing.We ordered the tendon and the food took the usual time to come. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. With such a crowd and queue I was expecting better. It tasted like food court tempura and I'm not being over critical. The up side is the quantity, the portion is generous.No point queuing for food court quality, but if you are looking for value for money, this is the place.

I tot I wouldn't like it because it's all fried and I might sick of it after few bites.. but nooooooo it was so delicious and it kept me going and finish the whole bowl.. Portion was abit too much for me and rice is only little hahaha but not A badthing after all.. love the non spicy seafood tendon would definetly come again

We reached at 1145am for lunch and queued for about 20 minutes. But food was good! We had the signature tendon tempura with spicy sauce & they were served quite fast. If you do not eat too spicy, you can ask for the sauce to be given separately. There’s also a choice of white rice or mixed grains. The free-flow pickled white radish is a great appetizer
4
Good tempura mix of vegetables, chicken and seafood. But beware of service charge and gst like all other sit-doen restaurants

The tempura is really so good and the portion is quite big.. the spicy tempura taste better than the original.. but the staff service not that awesome and kinda Long queue..
5
I'm not a fan of tendon tempura until I tried this recommended by my friend. The portion is big and complete. I mean, there is chicken, ebi, scallop, veggies etc. And the free flow white radish mix tastes good Some would say that the batter os too thick but for first timer like me, it doesn't really matter. Adding the grains to your rice is also free although it's not too significant

This eatery does not accept reservations and diners have to contend with queuing up to get a seat. We had the tendon set which came with noodles in a broth, and generous portions of tempura served on a bowl of rice. I had the spicy flavour version but suspect the traditional version should taste better as curry powder does not seem to go well with the rice, in my opinion. If you are a small eater, one set is enough for 2 persons

Even until many months in business in this location, the waiting line of this restaurant did not subside. It took us 1 hour 40 mins from 6:20pm to get a seat.Some set meals were ordered because everyone was hungry.The noodle was soft. Udon which was so soft that it melts in the mouth once slurped. The soup had ample umami flavour in it, combined with the fried tempura batter which made the soup even more savoury.The pickle had been one of my favourite since the first time i visited this restaurant. The quality was also maintained.The tempura-don then had an option of the standard Nanatsuboshi rice or the mixed grain rice.The chicken tempura was still soft and juicy on the inside.It was a time well spent waiting.The waiting line was still long when we left at 210

Queued for an hour since 6pm on a Saturday before securing seats. I was surprised to see that while small, the restaurant still had ample seating to invite more groups in. I guess the number of chefs isn't enough to cater full house.. but anyhow. The food was great and value-for-money. The vegetables tendon only costs $14 and comes with a lot of ingredients over a bed of rice (you have a choice of white or multigrain mixture of 16 grains at no extra charge). Verdict? Worth the queue when you're craving for a nice generous bowl of tendon. Not the best I've tried in Singapore though.

Huge portion of rice bowl with great variety of fresh ingredients used. The batter for the tempura is not too thick and does not leave a greasy feeling after meal. If not for the long queue, hot surroundings in the shop and waiting time for each bowl of goodness, this would be a 6 out of 5. A must-try when you go to Suntec City for dinner

My expectations was high visiting this restaurant as we always witnessed a long queue...however to our disappointment, the experience could be better! Tried the spicy tendon dish, found the tempura to be not crispy enough, the squid too chewy and the corn too raw a taste. The portion is very generous though with 2 huge chicken pieces! Miso soup is not provided or sold on the menu, could have been good to be included as a set. Service was not at the best as well, spoon was not provided and not mentioned until only half way through the meal, the spoons were offered by a wait staff going from table to table. Good place to go if you craving for Tempura rice bowl, however I would not queue for sure!

Many people like to compare this place with the other tendon restaurant at TP. I must say both were good, and with the same long queue. However, this one is queuing under roof and air-con. The sauce used here is slightly sweeter compared to the other. However, I find the service here slower and rather bad

Tempura lovers will love this so much. Rice was just ok.... compare to other japanese restaurant rice, i dont really prefer this. But the main was the tempura, and you should try it for at least once! No queue during non-peak hours. The portion is big, for small eaters you definitely have to share it with somebody

Portion is very big. Tempura freshly deep fried. Good for 2 persons to share. Restaurant is authentic and cosy.

Walk all the way from Bugis to try this tendon as advertised on TV. When during late afternoon around 4pm. No queue and seat available. Order the a la care Kohaku Tendon (Mix of prawn, squid, veg, chicken) and a cold green tea (refillable). Cost $15 +$2. With service and GST charges total bill is $20. There is a side garnish pickles which compliment the Tendon. Very big portion and value for money.

Let's talk about the food first shall we? Overall it's an acceptable tempura in Singapore standard wise. We've tried tempura all over Japan: Tokyo, Kansai, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and nothing beats the one at Beppu City in Kyushu called Toyotsune. For those interested to go all the way there, please try. That memory stays eternal. It's so light and crispy even with the sauce drizzled on top. Over here, when they put the sauce, the ingredients start to turn soggy quite rapidly. Though the taste and rice is still quite ok. The ingredients are also quite generous. Though you can't really expect much about the price in Singapore.Now about the appealing part. I believe most of the diners could felt it too, that the only waiter there and who served us was so rude and had complete disregard for the guests. It seemed as though all of us owed him something. It's ok if he doesn't smile, but he just can't be bothered to talking nicely to people. 1 guy walked in wanting to find a seat, the waiter just pointed at a chair beside without uttering a word. The guy was left puzzled.I ordered only 1 ice green tea since my wife doesn't usually order any drink. When I asked for a refill, he sternly said the tea is not for sharing, and offered if she wanted some ice water. I was left pissed after that, since from in the first place we didn't even shared any. If he suspected that we shared, he could at least try to speak to us nicely, instead of telling me off, when in fact we didn't even do it! To the point that other guests could easily hear it, leaving us embarrassed. So I plainly asked my wife to just go ahead and drink it. Screw that.I'm not sure if they're currently looking for a server, or that guy is just a half chef half stand in as a server, but he's just out of the world.And worst of all, this is a Japanese restaurant. A great job indeed

Located in Tower 1 (where Pasarella is), on the 3rd floor opposite the True Fitness gym. I always dislike going to Suntec City cos I keep getting lost. But just look for the snaking queue (there already was one at 6:15PM) in the Eat At 7 cluster.I really enjoyed the Kohaku Tendon ($15++); the batter wasn't soggy even at the end of my meal - which took a while because they are so generous with their ingredients! It also wasn't too salty, & the chicken was tender & moist. 3 major plus points over the other famous Tendon place in Tanjong Pagar (of which I didn't enjoy the chicken). I would come here again  Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats Doesn't accept reservation

At 11:30am, a long queue has already formed outside the store. It took us about 30 min to get seated, sharing a table with others. The menu is simple: with or without the set. I picked the later but regretted it as the only extra is the udon, which is nothing special.The quantity of tempura is quite substantial. The chicken, prawn and veggie tempura are coated with thick batter, not crispy but a bit soggy. The cold ice green tea is $2.All in all, the food is filling but not fulfilling.
5
really value for money but be prepared to queue. for $15++ you get a huge serving of rice with well-battered tempura, such as prawns, chicken, squid, crab meat, and some vegetables. quality of the rice is good. they have extra sauce on the table for those who need more oomph. service was prompt once you are seated. good that they dont try to offer too many things on the menu. just do what they are best at

Ordered the Kohaku Tendon bowl at $15.90++ each. It is a big bowl and came with the following tempura pieces: 2 prawns, 2 large chicken pieces, 2 long beans, 1 pumpkin, 1 baby corn, 1 cuttlefish and 1 mushroom. Taste is good, though fried, I did not feel that it was overly oily at the end of the meal. It could be because of the complimentary yuzu radish pickles. I gave it a low rating because of the green tea served. They charge you $2 for each cup. The water for the green tea (served mildly chilled) comes direct from the tap, unboiled and unfiltered. By the way they wash their hands and utensils from the same tap where they get water for their green tea. If you have to have a drink, ask for the ice water and yes, the water comes from the same source but it is free of charge. Maybe next time bring your own green tea bag or powder and save $2. :)) Will I go again? hm... let me try that Ginza tendon at tanjong pagan first. I will pay close attention to the making of their green tea too.... haha

Really, the queue that often appear is simply because the seating is limited and the kitchen cannot cope. Also, the poor taste buds of an increasing number rof Singaporeans is ultimately the cause celebre of this pretentious joint.The first visit yesterday after a long hibernation to stay away from the deplorable food scene in Singapore brough only anothee confident confirmation that food preparation is really at the bottom even if you have Japanese staff posing as cooks and not chefs using chepa ingredients and small portions designed to look big. The prawn is definitely frozen and processed, suspiciously from India or other 3rd World countries. While the vegetables and chickn are fresh, the zing of something alcoholic in the 'special' sauce leaves one wondering how much preservattive is used in the making. the squid and fish are equally forgettable. As for the rice, it does not even have the fragrance of Koshikari and could easily be well a cheap calrose substitute, which then brings up the question of why are we paying close to $18/- = Y1500/- and without green tea. To add to this insult on the pocket, the second prawn was coated in batter that had a heavy taste and smell of soda bicarbonate which totally destroyed the whole eating out experience

Came to the suntec brunch before 12pm and there was already a line. Granted, it was the long christmas weekend! Waited in line for about 45mins even though it didn't seem like a huge queue. Food took a while to get serve. Service was ok. However, the tempura with rice was amazing and well worth the 45mins queue. The batter was cooked to perfection, not stale, not oily. The rice was fresh. My favorite was the prawn tempura and it was literally cook to perfection. Everything was fresh. And for the number of of tempura served, $15.90 is a v good price

The restaurant was located at Eat At Seven in Suntec City. It was the first outlet in Singapore and was known for its long queue. Recently it had opened a second outlet in Boat Quay. As the queue was not long with about 10 persons in front of me during peak dinner hour, I decided to join the queue. The restaurant was small in size and packed. It took me about 25 minutes to get a seat. The place didn't smell.Menu was limited with mostly its signature Tendon in original($15++) or vegetable version, served with original sauce or spicy sauce. The set was an additional of udon soup with a topup of $4.50++. One could upsize the serving of rice with an additional of $1.50++. Looking at the menu, I decided on KOHAKU Tendon set ($19.50++). Iced water is provided free of charge.KOHAKU Tendon (S$15++/ ala carte)It looked great with a small bowl in it to put the the small hill of tempura on. There's pumpkin, baby corn, french bean (2 pieces), mushroom, chicken, crab stick, squid, and prawn (2 pieces) tempura. The vegetable ones were great but the prawn ones suck. Tasted strongly of stale oil, which covered the prawn's taste, made one felt jelat and wanted to gag. The udon soup was served simply with a slice of fish cake, tempura crumbles and chopped spring onion. The noodles was thin type, which was smooth. The soup was light and flavourful.Overall the food was overrated and quite expensive too. But then it was difficult to find a tendon place that did not smell
