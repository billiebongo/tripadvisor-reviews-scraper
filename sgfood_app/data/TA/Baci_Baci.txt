Had Sunday lunch with family. Pizzas were good, not amazing. Unique way of cooking carbonara which isnâ€™t to my liking but Risotto was excellent!
5
excellent food, good service, great ambience - situated in a nice and quiet neighbourhood. perfect for dates.
3
Arrived early ard 6pm on a weekday, there was no crowd yet. Enjoyed their ham & mushroom pizza, however find that the carbonara had an overwhelming porky taste. Don't mind visiting again.
5
We've been a few times now and the food has never disappointed. The serving portions are large and they don't stinge on the ingredients. The food is really well prepared, presented very well and taste great!
5
Buffet style with pizza, salad, calamari & Prawns, roasted vegetables, chicken fillets, roasted potatoes & dessert were delicious. Staff were friendly, attentive & professional. Nice place for family & functions.

Tucked away in a quiet corner somewhere in Serangoon Gardens, they are the only restaurant in the row of shophouses there. We decided to try after reading some good reviews. The ambience was nice, not too crowded on a Friday night. Food was good. We had 1 soup, 2 antipasti, 2 mains, 1 dessert, some wine and the bill came up to more than $300. I thought it was a little steep for a neighborhood joint.

Usually I do not like Italian restaurant and food far from Italy (I am Italian) but I really appreciated this restaurant both for food than for staff that is really professional. I enjoyed a mixed starter with parmigiana mozzarella, burrata and fried prawns and squid . Then delicious pasta with crab and martini , with a good negroamaro wine . I really enjoyed both dinner than location . Really good
4
I came here with a great friend to have a nice quiet dinner in Serangoon to catch up on things. Luckily we found good reviews TripAdvisor for Baci Baci. We really enjoyed the food especially the antipasti salad/cold cuts platter and main courses of veal spaghetti and lobster ravioli. The red wine was also nice and overall service of staff was good. I would highly recommend Baci Baci and will definitely be back again

Date night at Baci Baci.
Food was as wonderful as ever (my personal favourite is the ossi bucco), service first class, nice wines, reasonable price.
We missed Abdullah (night off) but the rest of the team did a great job. Love this restaurant.
3
Ambiance amidst the quiet Serangoon landed house area is amazing. However the staff service was not that great - it would be much nicer if there were staff who would greet and talk to you politely.
5
A bit of a hike to Baci Baci but well worth the effort.. a great environment and fabulous pizzas... a busy place and highly recommended
4
The pizza was pretty good. The 4 cheese was better than Hawaiian. Found the tomato sauce is the Hawaiian a little tart. Otherwise it's tasty.

With this place just round the corner from our place, we finally decided to give it a try after seeing all the thumbs up from other patrons. Widely regarded as one of Singapore's best Italian restaurant, we had set our hopes really high and were expecting to be impressed. Sad to say, for us, it was quite a let down. Our party of 5 arrived on a lazy Saturday afternoon and there were sparsely any other patrons, which was great for us as we wanted some privacy for our get-together. Nicely decorated and designed, it gave an overall cosy and nice place to chill out. However, it was a tiny restaurant, which would have been uncomfortable if the place was packed.Service was excellent and could not be faulted. The food was where the real let-down was. I had carbonara, and the rest had items such as prawn oglio and risotto. As I'm a carbonara fan, I've been trying out carbonara at multiple places, and I must say, for an authentic Italian restaurant, their standard of an Italian food was sub-par. The cream was not to my liking. The same went for the rest of the dishes, where we had tasted far better elsewhere. In the end, the appetiser bread with olive oil & vinegar was probably the besst dish served! Overall, I would recommend this place for friends to chill out and have drinks, the food....not so much
5
We loved the food, service and the ambience, They were very packed and handful of staff, But instead they did tremendous job, Food was delicious and can say it was really authentic, Service was great, all i can say that i will recommend this restaurant to all my buddies. Situated somewhere near serangoon, hard to find ,but its a hidden gem. Overall a great satisfaction
2
Having been recommended to this restaurant, I must admit I was very disappointed. In over 40 years of dining at Italian restaurants, I encountered my worst ever pizza. The base of the Margherita pizza was a solid tough dough and there was no basil on the topping. It was almost inedible and no staff member queried the fact that most was left on the plate.We found the wait staff surly and unsmiling.However the host was welcoming and pleasant; and those who ordered pasta dishes were satisfied with their meals
5
This is my 3rd time at Baci Baci . Fantasy dinner ! Friendly staff . we loved the place, very welcoming and warm , the Boss and staff were very experienced on recommending the menu and very friendly. We had a Hawaiian wood fired pizza, Risotto and Cod fish . The portion was very generous. A recommended white wine to pair with ... thumbs up! . We had a lovely dinner complete with their signature Tiramisu and chocolate lava cake deco with strawberries and blueberries as birthday cake for my girl. Can't wait to go back again ... higly recommended this little gem hiding in the estate! A little pricey and but definitely worth the money..
5
I have been to Baci Baci a few times and they never disappoint. Be it the antipasti, pasta, meat or seafood platter or the wine selection, the choices are always good and the ingredients, fresh. Service is also thoughtful without being overbearing. A gem in the neighbourhood and for the quality and prices, definitely worth a schlep from further away.
4
High quality Italian fine dining option at Serangoon Gardens residential neighborhood! Ingredients used are extremely fresh and the waitress can even suggest dishes not found on the menu and the chef is able to customize to your taste. However on the day we visited for lunch, pizza is not available for some reason. Tried the pasta dishes and find them to be really good, including the crab angel hair pasta! Service was prompt and attentive. Nested in a quiet residential area, parking can be found along the roads around the restaurant
5
Good food and excellent service. Group of 19 of us had lunch at this place on a Saturday. Ordered most of the best items like pizzas, pasta, steak and fish. Brought our own champagnes and wines which complemented the food well. Would visit again.
5
Excellent food and friendly/effective service, great atmosphere, wonderful home-made bread. Well worth a visit.
5
we've been eating at Baci Baci for two years, and even if/when we move well keep coming back.
Great food, service and value.

Excellent Italian food, well prepared. I had the Cod which was cooked to perfection.Baci Baci serves a nice french bread with meal, very rare in Singapore, they usually serve a slice of stale plain bread if any. So, for me this a treat.The Pizza is very good and I have had the Pasta as well
5
Being located in a local Neighbourhood, Baci Baci is not as well known as the Italian restaurants in downtown Singapore. But food quality, pricing, service and ambience all considered together, I would rate it as one of Singapore's best Italian joints. Last night, we had the Wagyu beef and the sea bass for our main courses and both did not disappoint.
5
Discovered Baci Baci through friends, delighted to have shared a meal with them at this restaurant.Nicely designed interior, fine wine cellar on display, excellent ambience.Food was excellent, everything we ordered was delicious and nicely presented. Advice on the wine list was first rate (thankyou Abdullah). Service was great. Salvatore came out to say hello.Just a wonderful meal and evening.One suggestion, time the meal delivery better. One of the started came a little late and two of the mains came quite a bit later than the other two. However, the rest of the experience was so good this does not affect my 5 star review
5
I would never have found this restaurant if it hadn't popped up on Tripadvisor. Looking for an italian meal, and preferably avoiding the crowds in the heart of the city. Well, Baci Baci is tucked away in a quiet street in Serangoon, just off Yio Chu Kang road. Plenty of street parking for those who drive, and a short stroll from Serangoon Garden Way, for the ecologically inclined diners who use public transport. Baci Baci is located at the corner of a row of unprepossessing shop houses, with a frontage of green shrubs. What a surprise when you walk in - a large, modern dining area with a grass-fronted kitchen area at the rear, and a walk-in wine cellar just to the right of the entrance. We arrived early, and it was quiet, but started getting busy around 700-730. The menu has a suitably wide selection of starters and mains. Portions were large. Three of us shared the caprese di bufala salad, and we were pretty satisfied. Bread was served with the starter, and it was generous and warm! For mains, the osso buco was tomato based served on saffron risotto. The saltimbocca was generous, if a touch chewy. We also enjoyed the fruit based sorbets to end. Service was friendly and efficient. Prices are more in line with city-based restaurants than your neighbourhood diner, but probably in line with the ambience and food on offer. You can turn up in shorts, but you'll probably fit the decor better if you are smartly dressed :-)

We were invited by our good friends to join the family for dinner to celebrate the birthdays of mother and daughter. This restaurant is located in the midst of a residential area. The interior of the restaurant is very tastefully done up. Despite it being a Sunday, the place was fully booked. The food was excellent and service was very good too. Compliments to the Operations Manager, Mr Raju who was very attentive despite the crowd. Will definitely visit again
4
Discovered this neighborhood restaurant, a gem. Lovely ambience, great staff. The starters were great - we had the calamari/seafood starter and a Caprese salad. The mains were not bad - the lobster pasta and lobster ravioli were pretty decent but no outstanding. The sirloin steak was a disaster (we regularly grill good steaks at home, so the different was stark). Then again, you wouldn't go to an Italian restaurant for a steak... Will try the pizza one day. Not quite sure we will be back
5
A restaurant that exceeds expectations is such fun. We have walked past it several times but tonight we gave it a try, and we were delighted! Great food great service and great wine list. Being tucked away seems to add a little to the allure, I don't think you will be disappointed. We were delighted
5
This is the best authentic and friendly Italian in Singapore tucked away from the hustle and bustle but well worth an indulgent taxi ride and an evening of dedicated Italian cuisine and hospitality.
5
Nice cozy and out of town restaurant.standard of food is excellent and services is friendly. The feel of always "want to go back"
5
This is simply one of the best places in Singapore for authentic Italian food.The Ambiance and food especially the Pizza was exceptional and highly recommended.
Its a little way out but well worth the taxi ride. Simply excellent.
4
We were invited for dinner with a close couple friends of ours and she didn't want to bother heading into the city area and chanced upon the above that's close to where they lived, so it's a first for us all. Surprisingly it was located amongst the shop houses of Serangoon Gardens, like a stand alone corner unit and with ample parking (especially in the evenings) along the roadside. The place was rather quaint and even has outdoor el fresco dinning if one prefers.We had the soup and entree which was nice and ordered the wagyu beef platter for us 4 and the knowledgeable sommelier recommended a decent bottle of red (not too expensive I think). Staff was courteous and attentive too. However, I'm not sure how much was the final bill as it was a treat. Nice place
4
As reviewed by many others, the food quality is as good as you can get in most fine dining Italian restaurants in town. The ambience is really cozy and atmospheric with Italian arias played. The wine list is extensive and the house wine is decent. This restaurant would do very well in a city location but being tucked in a suburb, it has a different feel to it especially when customers show up in Bermuda shorts. With prices equivalent to fine dining restaurants, it is not a restaurant I would go as often on weekends with the family. That's a shame as we enjoy the experience very much, each time when we visit
5
Some good friends invited us to join them for dinner at Baci Baci. We rarely venture into the 'burbs, but this little gem was well worth the journey! The restaurant is a corner shophouse, with a relaxed and elegant interior. Baci Baci serves good honest authentic Italian dishes, which is so hard to find in Singapore. The restaurant clearly buys top quality ingredients, everything tasted beautifully fresh. My Osso Bucco was tasty and perfectly done, and my wife's risotto with porcini mushrooms and truffles was perfect with the Brunello di Montalcino. Portion sizes are generous. They even have a selection of fantastic Italian craft beers! Not the uninspiring Tiger/Peroni/Stella beer list you might find most places. The service was attentive and the staff all very friendly. I will definitely be going back! Even just for the beer would be worth it, but the whole experience was perfect and such a refreshing change from typical Italian fare in Singapore

Hidden away deep inside Lichfield Rd is this hidden gem of a restaurant. We used to patronise what was the now defunct Bourno, so when we saw that Baci Baci had renovated the place and taken over, we went to try it out. And we were blown away by the quality of the food and the nice setting. It's become a family favourite for Sunday evening dinners as a family. It has a beautiful setting with great decor, and spaciously set out with enough room for privacy for each table. The staff are also super friendly, and at hand with a smile when we enter. Food wise, it's top quality and great tasting. We love to start with their Calamari, which is perfectly fried and paired with a great dip. We also love to order their seafood soup, which is packed with fresh seafood and very tasty. Mains: their pastas are all good; i particularly like their seafood pasta and their vongole. I also tried their lamb which was really really nicely done. They also recently started selling pizzas on their menu, with a pizza oven (wood fire). You get a great tasting pizza with the wood-y taste, and very generous toppings. Great for a nice dinner with family or friends, or to take a date there.You won't be disappointed
5
A charming restaurant in a quiet neighborhood and such fabulous Italian food. All was good from starter to dessert. I enjoyed the vongole clams, the squid ink risotto was tasty (altho a tad salty) and as for the tiramisu, although not my favorite dessert, it was superb.
5
Visiting this restaurant is like being invited into an Italian home, immaculate decor, warm, friendly staff and delicious food, excellent wines and relaxing Italian music for your ears - a positive assault on all of your senses!The best tomato base on a pizza I have eaten in Singapore, great selection of Italian wines by the glass. Thank you Salvatore for making us so welcome that we visited again within the same week for dinner when I was allowed to order off menu a very tasty pasta arrabiata, again superb
4
Went with my SO over the weekend. Hard to get to if you're not driving, and you have to know what you're looking for.Ambiance is perfect for a nice quiet dinner with your other half. The staff is polite and non-instrusive at all times. We took our time with the menu and the staff only approached us after it was clear we're done choosing (we closed the menu and placed it on the table)Must-try: their claims are simply delicious
5
Not located in the fanciest area of Singapore, this restaurant worth the trip to Serangoon.
The real italian food cooked by the Chef`Paqui is amazing. Mabel is always welcoming people with a smile and service is very good which is not so usual in Singapore.
5
Our first romantic dinner. Amazing r.s. I love baci baci , the ambience is good, service also good, most importantly the food is awesome, thanks for my dear to bought me there.
Kiki:)

Less choice for Vegetarians Courteous & excellent staff and service pleasant ambiance. Even allowed to cancel the one dish we had ordered
5
Excellent food! We had the antipasto platter for 4 which had a nice mix of Flavours. The beef with 3 pepper sauce was cooked to perfection and presented nicely. Great service and a good wine selection. No problems parking.
4
Good food, pleasant ambiance and great service. We over ordered and they graciously allowed us to cancel one dish. The lobster ravioli was excellent.
5
We had the seafood platter, beef special and squid ink risotto. The risotto was the best with fresh ingredients. Mabel is indeed enthusiastic and made us feel at home. I love the beautiful Christmas decor.
4
Went to Baci Baci as many 'local' places were closed across the Chinese New Year holidays. Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food, service and ambiance.It was not to busy, making the ambiance and service particularly luxurious. That said, not sure how the staff would handle a full house.Some dishes we tried were good, others were reasonable.Overall a very pleasant experience and highly recommended if you are looking for something different in the locale
5
Everyone enjoyed the food, esp my daughters. The ingredients were very fresh. Special mention to the lobster ravioli which was just fantastic. If there was no one watching, i would have licked the plate dry, The ambience was good and Mabel was the perfect host. Would be back again
5
My babe and I were finding a perfect place to dine for New Year's Eve and we found Baci Baci! Such perfect ambience and service was excellent. Walked into the restaurant and was greeted by Mabel , she's is as lovely as the whole set up of the restaurant. We were introduced to the amazing chef and was very impressed by his skills! Italian cravings definitely satisfied ! We wish Baci Baci the best as the new year approaches , we love you and did I mention I love my man?
5
Was not sure if the food would match the prices, but having been there a few times now, I can vouch that the food is excellent and consistent in quality. You would expect such restaurants in downtown, but this is a hidden gem in a classy suburban neighbourhood, some 11km from the city centre. It is worth the drive just to see the real Singapore, passing through the famous HDB public housing estates which are more like private flats in other countries. Mabel is such an elegant and excellent host that once would think she is the owner. The pizzas are really good and fired in the special open oven. Unfortunately, on my latest visit, the pizza chef was not available. Nonetheless, the other items on the menu are fantastic. Try the sword fish if in season, the squid ink pasta, truffle risotto and more.
5
Great food, great service. The food is consistently good each time I return to the restaurant. They have such quality wine and food that complement each other so well and is worth every cent. Every trip to the restaurant is such a treat!
5
A quiet and friendly family restaurant. Food is authentic Italian and fresh. Service is friendly, esp. Mabel - she's a cheerful and bubbly personality. Definitely worth a visit.
5
Had dinner last week.great food,great service Raju.Thanks for the lemoncello.Definitely will come back with the family
5
Been there twice. It's off the main restaurant area of Serangoon Garden but worth the visit. Food is good and ambiance is homely and friendly.
5
Great pairings of wine and excellent Italian cuisine. Excellent menu for the evening. Loved the soup....such layering of flavors!
5
The large antipasto plate was excellent and so generous. The kids loved the pizza. Really nice atmosphere, pretty interiors.
3
we were disappointed by the service ,. Of course it was very busy but we waited for long long time and at the end one of us did not have its main course .we then left . No gesture from management , just a 'good'bil
4
Wonderful little find thanks to a friend's recommendation, Baci Baci serves high quality Italian food with a smile and a dash of typical Italian bravado thrown in for good measure. Staff (special mention goes to Mabel, who handled all our requests with ease) were extremely attentive and gushed endlessly about the food and were eager to provide recommendations. Their bread basket had some of the most exquisite bread I'd ever tasted in Singapore flown in from Italy apparently (staff were quick to point out that it was for sale if we wanted to bring some home - trust me, I was tempted), accompanied by a trio of dips that could also hold their own (pesto, tomato and black olive tapenade - unfortunately these are not for sale). As we were a party of 8, we left it to the staff to fix us a platter of starters and we were not disappointed. We were presented with buffalo mozzarella, eggplant parmigiana and fried calamari (fritti) and by the end of our starters I believe we were all singing praises already. My main course, a ravioli stuffed with ricotta and porcini in a butter sauce topped with slices of bresaola (air-dried salted beef), was a beautiful balance of delicate textures and flavours. Friends had the 1kg wagyu, lobster ravioli and tenderloin. While I only managed to have a taste of the wagyu and tenderloin (which were exceptional - meaty and tender yet very light on the palate), there were no complaints across the table - everyone loved their dish. Desserts were a different story though - we had panna cotta, tiramisu, molten lava chocolate cake and pistachio gelato - while the panna cotta was a definite standout, the rest of the offerings were rather sub-par and admittedly, I've had better elsewhere. However, despite this minor letdown, dinner was a thoroughly enjoyable affair, what with the wait staff and chef closing the night with a rendition of a classic Italian song belted out in unison. Well appointed with a relaxed and unpretentious atmosphere serving up top class food with that homemade quality we often look out for - Baci Baci has definitely made a lasting impression; anyone and everyone ought to try it at least once
5
I reached just when the kitchen was about closed, it was late and I was hungry. The staff nevertheless greeted me smilingly, understood my situation and tried every way to make me comfortable. Though I wasn't keen for a cold salad in the starting (due to my perception of what a typical salad is like), one of the staff (Mabel) managed to turn around the situation in such a way that I can confidently say I had one of the best salads in my life. Not only were the ingredients so carefully selected and laid out, she took time to explain the whys and how's of each, that made me discover and appreciate the plate even more. Everything was perfect - the setting, the taste, the atmosphere, the smile, the wine, the music, and above all, the company, even though I was the last customer and it was late. This is what I call 'excellent customer service & excellent food'!!!Thank you Baci Baci and Mabel for making this memorable
5
Baci Baci is clearly establishing a new standard for Italian dining in Singapore. The high quality of the menu and wine list and the ambiance of the restaurant are both augmented by professional and friendly people and consistently excellent.This restaurant is, by a significant margin, the most enjoyable dining experience in Serangoo
5
Great wine and serving one of the best seafood Italian dishes. Lobster is a MUST try. Definitely one of the best Italian restaurant in Singapore. Chef Pasquales is a hidden treasure. Great ambience, excellent wine collection!
5
The food here is amazing and the staff are incredibly accommodating. They let us hang out with our puppies outside. The lobster dishes are great. The scallops some of the best I've had, this place is truly wonderful.
5
Definitely the best Italian restaurant in Singapore. Excellent food, fresh ingredients, traditional and experimental at the same time.
Quite location a bit outside CBD.
4
They really had good food, good service, good ambience but location wise is a bit out of the way ~ The good we ordered was really awesome. Not forgetting the bread serve was really good!
5
The chef Pasquale and his team welcomes you in a warm and friendly atmosphere. He cooks for you the best Italian cuisine with fresh and best ingredients. A true touch of Italy in Serangoon garden !
5
A hidden gem amidst the residential estate of serangoon gardens. Top notch food with great service to boot! So refreshing to come across an establishment where the staff are genuinely passionate about their menu and sincerely seeking to create a fantastic dining experience! A restaurant truly worthy of the highest praise
5
It was my first time with friends at Baci Baci. My friends and I were very very pleased with our experience there. The ambience was cosy and charming (a quiet and good atmospheric place) the staff especially Mabel was attentive and a good host and all the food that we tried was indeed simply amazing! My most favourite dish was â€˜melanzana alla parmigiana con bufala campanaâ€™. The eggplant with the sauce was so rich! The other dishes that we had were really delicious too. Look out for their Todayâ€™s Specials! For dessert, we had â€˜4 dolci baci baci â€˜ which consists of their mint flavoured panna cotta, lava cake (the chocolate French sauce that oozed out of the cake was heaven!), tiramisu and vanilla gelato (love the texture and taste of it!). All these were home produce. We also tried their other flavoured gelatos and their hazelnut gelato is a must have. They also have a good wine list. A hidden gem at Serangoon! I would definitely recommend this restaurant for those who would want to try good authentic Italian food
5
We had a wonderful evening at Baci Baci , authentic Italian food by Chef Pasquales , great ambience & impressive collection of wine . What's really stand out - the great hospitality by Mabel , she has given us very good recommendation of food for sharing as well the great choice of Moscato D'Asti to pair with the food.. It's the best pasta I've had which al dente to perfection & compliment so well with the veal wrapped with parma ham. I'm absolutely impressed with decor and they have very beautiful washroom. This is the place that I will go with my date again real soon .
5
Excellent suggestions for dinner, and took pains to suggest what kinds of food would be good for a group of 8. Waived corkage charge for the wine we brought along, and provided suggestions on how best to consume it. Nice music in the background, and good opportunity to see the chef at work. Keep an eye out for the decor
5
A bit disappointed at first as there was no pizza but instead we got to try the lobster pasta. It was delicious. Location is nice and romantic in a quiet residential area. Service was great. A big clap to Mabel ! She is very attentive and nice. Great place good food good service ! Will be back for sure !!! Way to go chef !
5
Not found of review I have to say that simple good nice and reasonable. I am traveling a lot and to be honest i'd like to find this kind of place every where!
Love it!
4
Had a wonderful evening with a family of 6. The staff Mabel is friendly and helpful with good recommendations. Great place & food (of course) to spend a nice evening with the family.
5
We had the ravioli with lobster and the ravioli with porcini and sage butter. Kids shared some pizzas and they were all divine! Friendly service and good wine list. Definitely would go back.
5
All round best experience for Italian cuisine, and the service comes highly recommended with extremely friendly staff and simple ambience. A real delight. Their risotto is a must have very true to the original
5
Looking for a good night out with amazing food and in a really good atmosphere. Think no more and go to Baci Baci to enjoy Pasquale's passion for delighting customers.Not only will he cook the perfect meal for you but he will also more than likely come and see you to make sure you are thrilled.A must visit! And not only once..
5
What a lovely experience. Stumbled on this beautiful outlet on an impromptu date night right where we live...if only I knew sooner! We shared the whole meal, most posting are good for 2 which is great! Gives you a chance to taste so much more! Highly recommended...as for Chef Pasquale! And Mitch and Mabel are great hosts
5
This Italian restaurant, opened a few months ago, has become our favourite place to eat out Western in the Serangoon Gardens neighbourhood. Very fresh and tasty ingredients, very good menu with interesting daily specials (the seafood salad was fresh and exquisite!), a good selection of wines, also by the glass and a service who goes the extra mile to make the whole experience enjoyable. You don't go there by chance, as it is not easy to find, but you make sure you remember the location, because you want to go back
5
It's been a while we tasted such authentic Italian cuisine with the freshest ingredients! Ambience is superb with great service staff (the chefs were so warmth)! Love the cleanliness and high hygiene standard! The night stands out with outstanding hospitality from Ms Mabel!Keep up the standard and it's definitely a YES from me! This is one restaurant to visit with a very private and cosy evening with friends and families
4
Pretty impressed with the decor (and washrooms!); not too cheap but reasonable price with a wide range of Italian delicacies to choose from. The dishes were not "wow" type but generally tasted good and were nicely presented with good portion for sharing. Lamb was tenderly good, lobster ravioli was flavourful (better change the ravioli to linguine), burratini was fresh, pizza was good, prawns in chilli tomato sauce was goodÃ¯Â½Å¾S Danielle ham was so-so, tiramisu was ordinary, seafood risotto was average, carbonara was ok.Better view the pictures to judge yourself :-
3
The diner is convival and relaxing.... almost like feasing in a party! Trendy and lively.Chef Pasquales is frequently at hand to grace your table - join you in your photo shoot even. "Who is doing the cooking" ... it did cross my mind.His Specials of the Day is intriguing. Truly. Agnello Scottadito $44. Saltimbocra Romana $34. Huh?!!I had smoked duck carpoccia - came with a bed of red rockets and goat cheese. My partner had the seabass fillet - complete with Mediterranean sauce, olives, capers, anchovies. The food wasn't bad... but did not seem to be definitively Italian. By any standard, the meal was not reasonably priced. $59 per dish. But the dining experience was fantastic. It like dining in a private party. Cheers, chatters, laughter ... everywhere.This outlet is, indeed, a rare find. It is also hard to find. Good luck in sniffing out its location.Otherwise, an enjoyable experience
