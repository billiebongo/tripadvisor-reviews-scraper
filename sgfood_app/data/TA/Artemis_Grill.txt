Unhappy with Artemis Service staffs responsiveness. Requesting for an items, need to request twice before been served. Not once, but 3 or more times during the dine-in.
5
Amazing Experience, love the food. Great service and vibe, perfect for an evening with a great view.
4
Food came quite quickly and whilst tasty and beautifully presented, portions were small. Waiters took a long time to serve the bread.
5
Reasonably price set lunch with the great view at the penthouse of Capital Green. Food is delicious and they just changed their menu for set lunch. Will be back to this restaurant again soon.

Very taste dinner with wonderful view! I recommend this place for all the turist that are in Singapur! You will not regret it

We visited at 6:30pm and it was busy with a young set of customers, although we managed to get bar seats without difficulty. Many different international beers and good tapas are available, at a price. But where in Singapore are they cheap?The ambiance is good and service is first class
2
I was little annoyed with their service to be Honest, we took wine pairing and they were really stingy with serving wine. Gave there glass of different wine and each glass has o my a sip of wine. When we asked for refill they never brought even after asking several times. None of them knew how much to serve. NOT WORTH THE PRICE AND I HATED THE SERVICE. Food was good
5
In Singapore for business and a great friend was visiting - this was an amazing restaurant - brilliant wine list, awesome food (steak tartare and venison for me), and great and very unobtrusive service. This was my first visit to Singapore but if I go back I will be making my way here
5
We ate at Artemis for my partners birthday on our stopover through Singapore. No words describe the quality of the food, and the gorgeous setting of this restaurant. If you enjoy fine dining, and want to eat looking over Marina Bay Sands - look no further.

Food was excellent, service could be better. I have been to the artemis and a couple of times and have always been very impressed by their food and service. However there seem to be some lapse in service last Thurs. They got our orders mixed up twice and the bill was also wrong. I have to say that this could be due to the very busy lunch crowd but would have to add that a place like artemis should have been more prepared to handle such volumes. Food wise was excellent as always
4
Love the decor and food was amazing. Only downfall is that the waiters never provide wine list unless asked. On the pricey side even with the set lunch option
4
great restaurant , wonderful view and excellent ambience. Food presentation is amazing, portions are quite small for the price. Duck Confit excellent!
5
The roasted beef was rather tough but the fish dishes (legine and sea bream) were excellent! The scallop appetizer was delicious. My family and I enjoyed the cocktails and dessert too. The birthday dessert for my dad was a nice touch (: thank you!
5
The food is fresh. It is a good choice for a fine dining experience. The bread with Zataar and olive oil was fresh off the oven. Appetizers and main course all were pretty good.
5
Great service, nice ambience, wonderful view. Variety on menu is able to satisfy a team with a sampling of food choices
5
Good view, excellent service and excellent food!
Strongly recommended.
The business lunch menu worths it.

Boyfriend and I had a quiet lunch by the window which perfectly puts us in clear view of MBS and Gardens by the Bay. We ordered the three-course set lunch: wagyu beef cheeks were divine. Added a charcuterie platter as well but it didn't come along with the starters, only after we started our main - weird. Waiter also took badly cropped photos of us on request but dismissive issue. Overall enjoyable

Good dinner experience in rooftop restaurant, with great views of Marina Bay and beyond; nice outdoor area for drinks too. Fine, interesting cuisine, and wine; discreet, attentive service. Atmosphere was a little quiet (maybe because it was Monday night), but the ambience was elegant and contemporary..
1
It starts with the disorganized welcome and the pretentious, falsely classy, cold setting and décor; it continues with the pompous ineptitude of the waiters; it goes on with the unending wait for the orders to be taken, and then for the food to come. Then comes the bland, boring food; not terrible, just terribly lackluster. All of this topped up by the most arrogant Maître d' I have encountered in a long time. Not to mention the stiff prices, by no means justified by the performance. Of course, there is the view, that's meant to make you forget the rest... But does it? Especially when you ask if you could make use of the roof garden and enjoy an al fresco dinner (for the price...) and you are haughtily rebuffed: "we do not serve meals in the roof garden". No discussion. Do not go there for gastronomy or a feel-good experience, just for the view..
4
Great view of the city, like many of the rooftop restaurants in the CBD (eg. Zafferano, LeVel 33, Me@OUE, Stellar, Tong Le Sap, etc). The atmosphere in the main dining room is a bit cold. The terrace is more relaxed, but not for everyone’s taste at lunchtime. We had dinner in the private dining room, which can accommodate up to 16 guests. The food is not Michelin Bib Gourmand standard , but is surprisingly not bad given the ‘mass production’ nature of the meal. The sole waiter was a bit rushed, but his zeal and friendliness resulted in commendable service. Good for business lunches or after-work group events, but you can do better when food quality and intimate ambience are critical factors.
5
Was recommended by friends. Very delightful that food was delicious and ambience was fantastic. Very scenic view..
4
Love the view of Marina Bay Sand! Menu is well balance and good selections. High quality and choices for bread selections, food were good of high standard and will not hesitate to recommend to anyone and return again soon.
5
Love this restaurant from a start, best view in the city, high quality food and good service. Thumb up and this is always my preferred venue for any business lunch. Good job Artemis!
5
Amazing rooftop view, new building CapitaGreen, makes for a nice place for a business lunch. Octopus salad as starter, roasted chicken for seconds, followed by a double expresso made for an excellent business meeting... :)
5
Service is great and so is the food.
Highly recommend for anyone for a couples dinner or a business dinner
5
The first impression is one of space, big views over the city and harbour. The room is filled with natural light. Then, a lovely smile and welcome. Followed by casual and personal service - something that is particularly rare in Singapore. I savoured the view and had a glass of wine as I waited for my perennially late companion (you know the type). Our server passed a couple of times and discussed the menu - keeping me company. Could have been inadvertent - but a nice gesture. Finally - arrival of the lost companion. Go forth and order from the fatted menu. Wagyu beef cheeks, octopus salad, chicken breast. Variety of sides - all good. Best would be my chicken (tender moist) and served with a sauce that I would gladly drink. We had no time for dessert, but they looked good. The coffee was excellent and accompanied by some little chocolates and other delights. Great venueGreat foodGreat service Iâ€™ll escape here for lunch anytime I want to get away from the clatter of Singapore.
4
Very pretty environment to dine at! Food was good and service was good but I felt slightly understaffed as only one person serving a few tables around us and slightly difficult to get their attention as we had to turn over the table by a certain time.
3
The view form this place is amazing and the rooftop bar is very nice.In our party two had G&Ts and one a cocktailThe G&T I had rapidly became dilute as there was ay too much ice in it.The staff at the bar were attentive. Things took a slightly different turn on entering the dining room. Service was slow and in many ways careless. After we had ordered the waiter then told us of the specials. Is that what he had been told to do ?We waited an inordinate length of time between courses and nobody checked back after food delivery.The tabew we had in the window was very nice but within 20 minutes a very large tabel next to ours filled up and the whiole experience felt cramped and not at all a pleasant dining experience. The somellier spent more time tidying the wine rack than she did attending to customers. I have never seen such inept pouring of the wine as I experienced from her, splashes of red wine on table and flying through the air.The wine selection is good but if you employ a somellier then why does she not liaise with customers on wine pairings?The bread was hugely disappointing. The Spanish flat bread was hard to the point of inedible as was the bread which came with my Japanese sardines starter.The starter was ok, I wouldn't put it any higher. My colleagues all had different starters and they said they were adequate.The main course I had venison which was fine and well cooked, the slow cooked Iberico pork simply looked disgusting like something unmentionable on a plate, perhaps try pre slicing before service to escape the unfortunate look. The steak was lacking in taste although cooked correctly as ordered.The roasted potatoes appeared to have been deep fried and not oven roasted and hence they were a little like overcooked french fries.The chicken liver with cherry sauce was simply disgusting with a very unpleasant taste.Onely one party had a desertm the ice cream degustation they said it was ok.The little ice cream lollipops provided were a nice idea but the combination of mango avocado and bergamot simply didn't work and they tasted like stale Earl Grey teaA disappointing experience despite the nice vie
5
The meats - beef, pork chop are succulent, tender and perfectly grilled. Service attentive. Side dishes - crunchy vegetables cooked just right; perfect roast potatoes accompanied by garlic sauce. Skip carboh free diet and indulge in their sour dough and mixed seed bread - the right amount of crunch and chewiness. The view is sensationa
3
Artemis Grill has an amazing view from the 40th floor. The fish was not very good but the chicken was excellent. Service was extremely slow. For what you get, Food is overpriced. I would go back again but only to have some drinks at the roof top bar
5
Excellent view great service and excellent food. Worth every penny. Great choice for a special occasion.
5
Understated restaurant with many interesting items on the menu, mainly French cuisine. Cool ambience, very smart. The bar has an amazing panoramic view of Marina Bay. Can recommend.
5
So Far this is the place to be dining at in the central business district with a great view and excusite Food. The menu has an interesting creation, good selection of wine and experience staff for front of the house.
4
This place is at 40th floor up at Capita Green Building. Stunning scenery even at lunch time. Good set lunch. Nice cheese platter too. Good service.
5
Nothing to fault at this place. Ambience, view and service was just magnificent. Food was fresh and delectable. Top notch place to dine for special occasions or an ordinary evening out.
4
Food is nice, not great, not bad at all. For what you pay, you'd expect something with a more of wow factor. Oysters were great though.
4
Up on 40th floor on the full moon night with view of Marina Bay Sands, the setting was nice for good dining experience. Food was good and prompt. Bread selections was more than anyone with top quality. Service was attentive and polite. It was the nice evening out and will not hesitate to return
3
went for the 2-course set lunch. had the melon salad for starter. huge piece of melon with a few crumbles of feta cheese. not to my liking. as the main i had the chicken. that was good, very tasty in fact.the service was poor. long wait for the drinks. also, when i asked a second time for the drink the waiter was offended and responded unprofessionally rude. won't be back to this restaurant
5
Chef Fernando Arevalo is one professional who believes that his food is only as good as the ingredients he uses. At Artemis, he sources for sustainable products from only the best suppliers. And the results show. A meal here is always a joy. The highlight was the salad of heirloom tomatoes and burrata and also a moist organic roast chicken with crispy skin. I always look forward to my visits.
4
My fave spot is the outdoor bar late at night. It has a very intimate feel. You can watch the Singapore skyline while sipping your cocktail in the cool night breeze. The lights are dimmed down for a more relaxed and cozy ambience. Staff are amazing, friendly, and very attentive
4
The view was gorgeous! Have a drink before dinner at the bar and you will struggle to leave. The food and service was just great.
5
If you are looking for a venue for a business lunch or even to bring friends, this is the place to go!
Beautiful view, excellent cuisine and spotless service!
5
Ambience was amazing as it is on level 40, food is delicious and aesthetically pleasing. Good service as well! Highly recommend for special occasions as it is an upscale restaurant.
5
This amazing dish that been served with a hint of spice to make it more to asian style. Should try unless someone couldn't have raw food.
3
Good food but horrendous service . Where did they find these people ?? Terrible staff which make you feel nervous
5
Got invited to this place by a good friend to celebrate my birthday. The food was great and we were treated to a refreshing fruit lollipop for cleaning palette which was on the house. It was so yummy that we asked for second helpings casually mentioning that it was birthday dinner when lo and behold we were treated to more desserts and an improvised pineapple tart as a birthday cake. What a pleasant surprise! It was a very good evening! Will definitely be back again

Went to Artemis for a drink and dinner - on the occasion of my wife's birthday. Started off well with drinks at the fabulous outdoor rooftop bar, and then we went to dinner inside to lovely (but over airconditioned) restaurant. A staff member immediately brought a shawl when asked, to keep my wife comfortable. We were seated at a lovely window table, possibly as I had mentioned during the easy booking process that it was my wife's birthday.To keep this short - starters were excellent. Then we received an "interim" dish as mains were apparently delayed. It got complex after that and without going into detail, at a stage we were of a mind that we would not come back to Artemis. BUT, the staff and Anand, the manager, had other plans. Again, no need for detail, but we left feeling we had experienced a "correction" we had not seen before in our many many years of dining at top Singapore restaurants. Well done Artemis. We left quite impressed.Ivan van Nieker

Taking some guest for dinner I was expecting good things based on the previous reviewers. Unfortunately the poor service and high price let's the good food the kitchen staff produce down. After sitting there for 40 minutes we had to ask for the food menus. And then we had to ask again after waiting another 40 minutes whether we would receive our appetisers soon. "We forgot to put the order into the computer" was the response. The food came and it was good so full credit to the kitchen team which have unfortunately been let down by the front of house. Upon leaving 2 hours and 45 minutes later after only 2 courses they said we still had a quarter of a bottle of wine left which we thought we had drunk as our glades were left empty for some time - another service fail. Given the high prices charged and the poor service I cannot recommend this establishment. There are plenty of other better value, better service restaurants in Singapore
5
The recommendations made by Ian is great and both my wife and I were pleasantly greeted with the good food (slow cooked Iberico pork and Austerie fillet) and great cocktails and wine.The ambience and attention to details (Ian again!) made our experience more fulfilling while we soaked up the scenic view of MBS and the bay.Will come again and recommend to friends and business partners to enjoy a smashing night or chill out session

This restaurant is located on the 40 floor of capitagreen building. There is a basement car park with lots of parking spaces. Nearest MRT station would be Raffles Place. On the 40 floor, there are 2 parts of the restaurant, outdoor n indoor. The outdoor cafe is located in a high rise forest. We had the indoor dining and our table oversee the marina bay. It was really lovely. The lady who was serving us was very attentive and friendly. The price of the food is reasonable. We shared 3 appetizers n each with our own main. There are choices for vegetarians too. We spend an average of about $100 SGD per pax. Very suitable for birthday celebration, the restaurant does special birthday celebration.
5
Lovely ambience, delicious food, great cocktails, amazing views, excellent service, went over & above to help with my marriage proposal. Thank you!
4
Food was good but menu was limited.
Dessert combinations did not meet expectations. Bread variety was good
5
Good fine dining food with good variety. The restaurant's look is modern and dining outdoors is a good option as well if you want a view of Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Singapore skyline.
5
We celebrated our first anniversary here and it was lovely! Food was amazing, view incredible and Artemis Grill made it even more special with the great service and pampering us with a sweet and yummy anniversary treat! Best choice for couples celebrating any special occasion!
4
We had a drink in the bar first. The bar tender was friendly and knowledgeable. Then proceeded to dinner. The steak, and more especially the sauce, was outstanding.
4
Ambient was great. Waiters and waitresses were very friendly. The view was just awesome.We ordered the set lunches for S$45 (2 courses without dessert) and S $50 (3 courses with dessert).Food was average, nothing to scream about. I like it that there are plenty of space between tables, so that's no feeling of eavesdropping. Good to make reservation cos the place can get crowded during meal time
4
My wife and I decide to celebrate National Day with a view of the fireworks after 10 months of pregnant. Block by another building, apart from that it was still quite a view at the level 40 restaurant. We shared appetizer - Smoked Eel but it was kind of salty. Not quite what we are looking for. A 2/5 stars dish. after which we had Slow Cooked Iberico Pork and Venison Loin. Delicious, 4/5 stars! Only issue is the portion is a bit small. Last but not least, we shared the Artemis Crushed Potato Wedges and it's really tasty. 4/5 stars for me. Overall a very good dinner for both of us and we both enjoyed ourselves
5
I had a great dinner at Artemis and it started right from the time I reserved the table. Anant ,who attended to my call was patient with my enquires and even suggested reserving a table at the bar outside to watch the fireworks after my dinner. I greatly appreciate his initiative. Everyone was attentive to our needs during dinner and my friend and I enjoyed our dining experience. We would definitely love to return again
5
We went for the set lunch set and it was value for money. We added on one ala carte dish (iberico ham) and it was good too. The chef certainly knows how to handle chicken breast meat. The chicken breast that I ordered was tender and not dry at all. Will certainly visit again
5
I came for dinner with my son and had an amazing evening. It is a perfect spot overlooking the harbour, Singapore river and financial district to watch the sun go down and to see the city lights and Marina Bay Sands light show. The food was heavenly with very fresh quality ingedients. I had the squid followed by black cod in a delicious soup. My son had corn soup followed by the best steak he said he has ever had! The freshly baked bread was irresistable. Service is very friendly and attentive. The best experience I have had in a long time
5
We thoroughly enjoyed dinner in Artemis last night. We started with drinks in the outdoor bar with a stunning view. The dinner that followed was as good as the view!
5
View was very good from the restaurant and the staff was attentive without being intrusive. The food was excellent and with interesting items on the menu to offer. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.
5
Great food, great service, great views. Best way to spend a birthday dinner (well any dinner really) when in Singapore. Highly recommend.

Mediterranean cuisine, sustainable produce—these are what brought my attention to Artemis. Prior to visiting this place, I was not sure if I had made the right choice. Turns out that this restaurant is one of best surprises of the year. Not only does the food here scores high on taste, it is also aesthetically pleasing.The much raved about beautiful view of the Marina Barrage from the rooftop will impress many, I guess. If seated at the right location, one can even see the iconic Supertrees of Gardens by the Bay. The interior is of minimalist style to let the skyline of the city runs the show. Since I appreciate nature more, I acknowledge that the place is absolutely great for dates, but I am not exactly bowled over by the setting of the restaurant. So let's go on to talk about the food instead.It is quite a novelty that a service staff carries the wooden tray filled with bread and makes her rounds to the tables to serve the bread. And to top this off, instead of butter, powdered spices and olive oil are provided as dips for the bread. The taste is interesting, but the dips do not integrate well into the bread to create a harmony of texture and taste. The bread itself is not served warm. And it is kind of hard but not toasty to justify the dry texture. I am very fussy about my breads, so the bread here does not win me over.Moving on, casting the bread aside, the other dishes get the thumbs up from me. Alaskan King Crab is love at first love because the generous chunks of fresh, succulent crab meat are oh so sweet. And the creamy, slightly tangy dressing with finely chopped vegetables serves to accentuate that sweetness of the sea. The avocado slices are welcomed addition since I love the smooth balmy creaminess of this berry. The dressing also goes very well with the avocado since it adds a kick to the mild taste of avocado. Tomato petals, which looks like bacon, has very intense, full-bodied flavour. This appetizer is best enjoyed by savouring these ingredients separately since they all have distinctive tastes that can be combined but each is good enough to shine on their own; the avocado refreshes the palates, and the tomato petals give the oomph factor to complement the crab meat. This dish is a must-order.Octopus Salad is truly a very unique salad since the cooked vegetables are used instead of the usual raw ones. The best part is it also tastes great. The broccolini, which is a hybrid of broccoli and kale, is every bit as juicy and crisp as raw vegetables, thus having that wonderful bite that many love in their salad. Fine preparation is needed to achieve this and retain that beautiful dark green colour of the vegetable. The other ingredients of the salad simulates the senses: citrus flavour of the artichoke adds zest to salad, and the romesco sauce of vivid orange colour introduces earthy tones to the taste. The cylindrical pieces of octopus are grilled to perfection—featuring the rich aroma of grilled seafood and being slightly chewy, but not overly so. If I have to nit-pick, my only grouse with this appetizer is that one of the octopus pieces is too thick, thus being too chewy to my liking.Beetroot Gnocchi is one of those vegetarian main courses that is not only healthy, but also tastes delicious. The fresh and crunchy vegetables pairing with the pungent feta is a bold combination that works, due to the strong taste of feta adding a zing and accentuating the clean taste of the various vegetables. The pink-hued breakfast radish not only adds colour to the dish, this juicy, zesty, crunchy root vegetable incorporates a contrast in taste, for that extra excitement. And the vegetables also go very well with the mashed celeriac that coats them with a layer of subtle flavours of celery with nutty overtones. Beetroot gnocchi has that glorious shade of reddish purple and looks very appetizing, but it is far more subdued in terms of flavours. The sweet earthy taste adds dimension to this mains though I have to admit that the other ingredients steal the show instead. And I do find this dish to be slightly similar to the Octopus Salad due to the use of broccolini.After trying these dishes with bold, clean and striking flavours, I do wonder if the dessert, Salted Vanilla Ice Cream, can match up to them. I find my answer where I take the first bite of the ice cream, served at the perfect temperature—cold enough to retain the shape yet higher than freezing point to allow the flavours to be released. It is sublime because of the intense milky taste. Either eat on its own or savour it with carrot cake sponge and walnut crumble, it is all good.Petit fours served at the end of the meal is a nice touch, but given how exciting are the appetizers, mains and dessert to the senses, these cute little pieces of confectionery do not really make that much of an impression.As for the service, the friendly staffs get all the basics right, and I can see that they really try hard. They can do better if there is an extra sharpness in the observation of surroundings and the handling of orders. Things are still pretty good when I arrive at the earliest timing, almost. But the staffs get real busy when the restaurant is full, yes, it is full on a weekday afternoon, so it is best to make reservation, and it may be difficult to get their attention. All in all, I still give the service here the thumbs up, especially when they bid farewell to me when I am leaving. To me, this tiny gesture leaves a nice ending note to the dining experience, it matters.So will I come back? It goes without saying that for sure I am

We were a party of 16, out for a nice business meal. The Artemis is located on the top floor of the CapitaGreen building with a breathtaking view of the city and the marina bay. The restaurant is very elegantly designed with great lighting to perfect the ambiance. The menu is well built with a good selection of seafood, meat, fish and vegetable. You can find a dish for everyone. I started with the octopus, had the beef tenderloin for my main course and finished off with salty vanilla ice cream. They were all incredibly tasteful and pleasing to both the eye and the palate. Service was excellent throughout the evening. The restaurant is great for romantic dinners (if you're looking to impress, ask for a table up against the window) and seems more suitable for "formal" dinners, though a table next to us had two young kids!We spent roughly ~170 Sing Dollars per head including soft/hard drinks. Was a great enjoyable and tasty evening
1
As a romantic date night with my wife this turned out to be poor. Service was slow, not one dish that was delivered to the table was explained and our wine glasses empty. I had to raise my hand to get the attention of the waiters like I was at a hawker center. For a $370 dinner for 2 (including a bottle of wine) I was disappointed overall
3
Nice view & ambience for catchup over lunch with friends... was pretty crowded on a weekday though set menu was a little on the high side for 3-course..Dishes were not that impressive... didn't even bother taking a picture of the octopus salad... chicken breast was relatively moist... but the dessert was a let-down... ordered coffee to go with it but it only came when we were about done... probably short-staffed..
3
I called in advanced to indicate my intention there to celebrate 2 of my besties' birthday. We ordered cocktail, a bottle of red wine, half a dozen of oysters, beef sliders and chicken drumlets. The chicken drumlets were served quite 'bloody" and we were told that it would be complimentary/on the house when they re-served the dish. However, we were still charged when we called for the bill. Nothing was done to serve the complimentary birthday dessert even when we called for the bill. I guess they are shorthanded to pay attention to request(s) from guest seating outdoor, having bar snacks. Btw, when I called up to make the special arrangement (that was not fulfilled), they told me that they can only serve 1 complimentary dessert even though there are 2 birthday gals. If you have been to Singapore Land Tower (closed down), it is somewhat similar ambience. I may not return to the place (unless special request from friend) as it was quite pricy and food served is average.
4
The excellent service to which we had become accustomed had slipped in its excellence somewhat. One of the guests arrived early and was shown to a table. Another guest arrived separately and was shown to another table. When I arrived, no one noticed and I discovered both guests seated at different, but fortunately, adjacent tables. If anything, the food was the usual excellent food which has come to be expected of the place
5
Was at Artemis to celebrate my best friend's birthday, and I must say i'm very pleased with the service and the food. Indicated in the booking remarks for "a table with a good view", and we have indeed been seated next to the window facing the MBS. The staff were very attentive, and the food was scrumptious with a fine touch.Will definitely come back again!
5
I really enjoyed my visit to the restaurant. Service was great. Service staffs know their menu and gave great recommendation
5
Exclusive fine dining with view! The warm bread and dukkah is to die!! Basically we liked everything here!
2
Food is pretty ok, restaurant quite nice. But all is lost because the poor and incredibly slow service, which even by Singaporean standards is very bad.
3
Normally find the food exquisite, but today the beef was salty and sauce too thick. They forgot my request for more bread. I hope this was an off day, because it's a beautiful restaurant and the views are amazing.
5
I am living in Singapore for a couple of years and Artemis remains a great choice for a Dinner.Nice bar to have a drink before the Dinner, great view over Marina Bay Sands, and an excellent mix of classical and inventive food. I am not vegetarian but there are some amazing vegetarian appetizers and main courses.Good things do not come cheap but fine to pay the price for good quality
4
This is a lovely restaurant with a spectacular view of the Singapore skyline from the 40th floor. The bar is open air and really cool at that height.The food, by Colombian chief Chef, was unique and delectable. We loved the heirloom beetroots, charcuterie platter, roasted mushrooms and 2 types of French oysters. The chargrilled octopus and raviole must not be missed.For mains, I absolutely loved my Grilled Avocado that was filled with a cream cheese like filling with crisp bits in it. The wagyu striploin and the slow cooked pork were great.We happily ended our meal with heavenly desserts - salted vanilla ice cream, dome aux fraises and chocolate ganache.The terrible service was the only spoiler - There were just too few staff and they looked so overworked, we tried hard to be patient. We had to wait 20mins to get our menus and some water......and the wait continued through the night!
5
We went to Artemis Grill for company lunch on this Wednesday. All the 9 of us ordered the 3 course set lunch. The restaurant offers 2 choices of complimentary freshly made bread, dipped with spices & olive oil. My set lunch started with Octopus Salad and I thoroughly enjoyed the appetizer. The grilled octopus was fresh & chewy, mixed with vegetables & olives etc, it was really delicious. Next up was Grilled Sea Bream. The fish was fresh & I thought the portion was generous, considering that this is fine dining. My colleagues who ordered the Wagyu beef couldn’t stopped gushing about the tenderness of the meat, such was the quality.Finally came the dessert – Chocolate Ganache. I enjoyed every little bit of the dessert so of course there was nothing left on the plate.Overall Artemis Grill serves pretty good value for money set lunch. The view was nice & it should look even better in the evening. The staff were attentive & polite, they will go round the tables to ensure we will not run of water (or bread). Last but not least, I thought the food presentations were pretty impressive, the chef must have put in a lot of thoughts because it not only looks good but it tastes great as well.
5
Just had the meal of perfection - all chosen by Derrick our amazing host. Tasting plates: wild sea bass sashimi, Japanese sweetcorn broth, Spanish octopus, venison - words can't do justice to the taste. Service was impeccable. Chef came out to explain one of the dishes - passionate about his cooking and enhanced our experience of taste 100% - amazing. Music was brilliant - as an aside - added to the wonderful Atmosphere at Artemis. Can't recommend enough and can't wait to come back. This is my 3rd visit and the best yet. Previous visits equally amazing - but in corporate setting with large groups. Same great service, but the experience as couple was far superior. Thank you Derrick and the amazing team @artemis. We will be back
3
I had come to this restaurant before where I tried the ala carte dishes. This time round I had the lunch set, but the fish was so-so only. The Baby Kale Salad was also a let down. However, the octopus salad was good and the chococate dessert was unique.
5
It was a very smart restaurant for a business lunch but did not feel too stuffy. The food was great and the service prompt, efficient and non-intrusive. I thought the overall taste of the food was also good, the beetroot salad at the beginning was fantastic, clean, fresh flavours. Overall a very nice experience, would also return for evening drinks.
5
Never expect chicken breast could be so tender and juicy with crispy skin. Oysters were amazing delicious.
5
I visited Artemis is good service and very delicious food , King crab salads and chicken breast I like so much
It's wonderfull service also and the view of restaurant near Asia square it's look very nice
5
Oh the Beetroot entree with the Horseradish ice cream. It was to die for. Others thoroughly enjoyed other tasty options. Mains was chicken. Spiced and cooked to perfection. Our deserts included the Meringue. How do they do it. We thought pure magic. The views from the bar a bonus. The service extremely professional and attentive. This was a great foodie experience. Worth including in your must do's .
5
Had an amazing grilled avocado as a main, I never expected that an avocado could be a main. And I felt surprisingly satisfied despite being a girl with an appetiteLovely place with great ambience, the inside area is very conducive for having a conversation with a great viewI had luggage with me having just flown into Singapore, but the hostess took care of it (they have a coat check

We had a table by the windows and was able to see the Marina Bay - beautiful view! The food we ordered were good quality and beautifully presented to us. The overall services was excellent, and I would recommend for small group gathering. However, the portion of food may not be enough for bigger eater
3
There are indoor and outdoor sitting.Indoor = fine dining and Outdoor = bar and casual Advice to make reservation in advance.Food is not bad, we tried the smoked eel, trio mushrooms, caviar as appetiser and venison as main course to share. something unique is the ice-cream degustation: seaweed ice cream with crushed sesame, rose vinegar ice-cream and saffron chocolate ice-cream
4
Located at the CBD area, this restaurant gives a good view of Marina Bay Sands Hotel from the city.Has lounge outside, so can chill out for drink after work.In my case, I went to have business lunch, which the set menus are value for money.But please make earlier reservation as it can always be crowded
4
I was impressed by the ambience of the restaurant. I requested for a corner seat and was given one but was under sunlight. It got pretty warm after a while. If the service staff asked if we would like to change our seats it would have been perfect. Food was impressive but so was the price. We were also given a complementary dessert by the restaurant which was a really nice gesture.
4
Artemis has 2 and 3 course lunch set menu that is value for money.There is the "wow" effect when the lift door opens on the 40th floor. Beautiful view of MBS and esplanade and the restaurant is bright and spaces between seats gave sufficient privacy. Food is really good. Would certainly return with family and business lunches
5
We visited Artemis for first time on Friday night and were not disappointed. It was a meal on last night if our sons visit to Singapore and he wanted to go to a restaurant with a view. We have been to Spago, LeVel33, Jaan, and Stellar and Artemis is right up there. We hAd the Jamon and Venison Loin and Wife had Black Cod all was excellent and whole evening was wonderful way to send off our Son Highly recommend Artemi

Derrick, the manager has made our visit a wonderful experience. Yes, the food is well curated and we are coming back for more.
5
Fantastic quality food and great service.... absolutely top notch ! Love the view and you can't beat the ambiance at lunch
5
Food, staff, and view are amazing. I've been here many times for business lunches. All glass 40 stories high looking in to the Central Business District of Singapore, with great food, wine, and service.
5
Amazing service from the minute you step out of the elevator the view would be worth just having a cocktail in the outdoor roof top space and the food is amazing
All in all well worth the visit
5
Excellent food, great wines and extremely nice service.
The originality of the dishes were great!
Loved the black cod, absolutely delicious.
3
I visited Artemis with some friends the experience was overall ok, however my main problem was with the attitude of the staff who basically didn't care. This means a few things mainly a) the food see photos I ordered the duck it came badly overcooked when we complained after a long time they brought back duck that was raw... very disappointed they told me it was medium rare it was not And b) a minor complaint but the wine is very pricy we had to force them to decant it, we had a bottle of wine sat unopened on the table after it was ordered may seem minor but looks at the prices they charge! Sadly not a great experience
4
This is my second visit to Artemis within a week of my first visit. The first was a family dinner, whereas my return visit was for a business lunch.The food was excellent. I ordered beetroots, which were flanked with a beetroot-horseradish ice cream. For the main I ordered the venison loin cooked to medium rare for dinner, and the grilled sea bream for lunch. Artemis excelled in terms of the quality of ingredients used, presentation, portion and value. Likewise the bread, the dried olive dip, and wine were all very satisfactory.The only area where I felt Artemis lagged was the seeming lack of manpower. On both occasions there was limited attention to our table, and understandably so - if I remember correctly, there were probably three or four waiters/waitresses active in the dining area. Manpower was evidently stretched thin, and it was thus rather difficult and slow to get the servers' attention. They were, nonetheless, polite, professional and positive in both service and demeanor.Incidentally, I will return again later this week to host business guests over drinks and dinner. The scenery and ambience at night are impressive, and on this visit I will get to experience the al fresco bar area.All in all, this is a keeper that I am quite that that I will continue to host guests and good friends at. Artemis is tucked quietly away on the fortieth floor of the CapitaLand tower, but the elevator door opens up to a classy and vibrant dining setting with services and products of high quality

Location - on the top floor of a high rise in the financial area - very close to Asia Squares, walking distance to the Westin hotel where I was staying at. Ambience - elegant , with a nice view. The food - I had the octopus appetizer which was good, but I thought the black cod main dish was disappointing. There was no seasoning to the fish whatsoever- relying on the sauce to give the fish some flavor just did not work out . My friend had the duck dish which tasted good. Service - adequate but not great for a restaurant of this caliber...Overall , disappointing..
4
Food is delectable and view of the Marina Bay is great. Waiting staff was communicative and Sam the manager was very attentive. Appreciate the complimentary champagne and dessert because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. All in, a very pleasant dining experience, except the dining room was a bit too noisy.
5
Started the evening at the outdoor bar which has a fantastic view. Must try the GT cocktails esp the Bluecoat. Moved indoors for dinner - request a window table which have fantastic views as well. The outdoor and indoor staff were attentive and fun. Service is impeccable. Had the asparagus and octopus appetisers. Asparagus was fresh and perfectly cooked crunchy but not raw tasting. The octopus is moist, tender and flavorful. For mains we had the Black Cod which comes with ab beautiful pork-yuzu broth which was a little cold tho. The Iberico Pork is tender and juicy and make sure to pair each bite with the apple and water chestnut to bring out the full flavors of the dish. Wonderful evening adn will go back again
5
Always delicious food in an elegant setting with beautiful views of Singapore CBD. Very reasonable value set menu for lunch if required.
4
Had dinner at Artemis for our wedding anniversary. The service was perfect and the waiters really took care of us.
The food was excellent and very fine.
I'll definitely recommend this restaurant for any event or corporate dinner.
3
Nice ambience, service and food is good. Staff attentive. Location is an upper hand as they get business crowd.
2
Great view and ambience but a bit on service. The staff are a bit cold and clinical. The hostesses/greeters especially are not warm and friendly.The dishes on menu are not particularly jumping out and shouting order me!For the price one would expect to see more greens but it's mainly potatoes this or that and starchy ones only. I find myself chewing on bread for refreshing the taste buds.Meat is well cooked but should add some greens or tomatoes
5
One of the great things about Artemis Grill is that the experience starts as soon as the lift opens onto the 40th floor and you are greeted by the breathtaking and unobstructed view of the Marina Bay Sands in all its glory. If you have the time and would like a drink before dinner - would recommend having a drink at the bar first. Our experience was only enhanced by the pleasant and attentive service staff - we had a very attentive waiter - Sunny, who was friendly and happy to give his recommendations. We also had the sommelier recommend wines to accompany our food orders. He let us taste a few wines before making our decision on which wine we would prefer.The food also tasted amazing. A must have starter is the grilled octopus. All the mains we ordered were cooked just right. We had the cod, the steak, the pork and the venison loin - I would recommend all. Then for dessert we had the strawberry dome and the chocolate ganache - all visually pleasing and also nice tasting! To top it off, it was my sister's birthday and they surprised us with a free birthday dessert! Would recommend this restaurant
5
Before I start writing about the food and the ambience, I would like to commend the staff of Artemis. We had a really fantastic experience. The service was superb, and very professional. Right from the moment we stepped into the dining room to the end of the meal , Derrick Lim, Sam Ong, Firaus, and Arun, took care of our every request and query.Located on the 40th floor of the CapitaGreen Building, in the city, this restaurant is well placed for business lunches and dinners. Indeed many of the clientele looked like young bankers and other hard-working millennials. The dÃ©cor was classy and purposefully simple. The ambience was youthful and vibrant. It was a Monday, but we made a reservation and was rewarded with a table by the window with a view of the water. We arrived there 6:30pm in time to still enjoy 'happy hour' which ends at 7pm. I had a glass of bubbly and my partner a beer. We had two appetisers. First, the Chicken Liver & Black Truffle, which came with a sauce that became a perfect dip for sourdough bread . The second appetiser, one and half dozen oysters, (happily) took a while to arrive, thus allowing us more time to enjoy the chicken liver. We also ordered a bottle of white wine before 7pm to take advantage of the happy hour promo.For mains I had two starters, the Seabass Sashimi, three medium sized slabs of very fresh fish treated subtly with lime juice and served with just a bit of avocado paste (note: no wasabi here). It was unusual but pleasing on the palate. I wish my knife was sharper to slice the fish properly. Then I had the Alaskan King Crab Salad. The substantial crab leg was presented in five or six slices on a bed of salad. It was really good.My partner had as his mains the Slow Cooked Iberico Pork. It was not as tender as he had expected. For dessert we decided to share the Ice Cream Degustation, a trio of different flavoured scoops with different sauces - if you like ice cream, this is highly recommended. Our favourite was the scoop served with seaweed; it had a salty and sweet sensation, and was oddly delicious. The chocolate ice cream was a close second. When the icecream came, the staff surprised us with a complimentary glass of dessert wine each. A perfect ending to an excellent evening. Thank you, guys

We reserved online and requested a window seat which was given. There were the panoramic views of the city skyline. and despite the high humidity of Singapore, the restaurant and bar remained cool and comfortable throughout the meal.Innovative menu and good service. I tried the beetroot gnocchi as a main course but the highlight of the meal was the dome aux fraises dessert
4
It was our first time in Artemis and I would say we were pretty impressed. The ambience in the alfresco bar was excellent, the service was impeccable, the cocktails were original and the food quality was outstanding. The only beef we had was that our table in the restaurant was directly facing the kitchen. While my view was not so bad, the hubby had to contend with kitchen and dining staff going in and out.
5
We were unfamiliar with this venue but it came highly recommended as an understated restaurant on the rooftop level of CapitaGreen. We managed to secure a table for a dinner taste test. The space was welcoming with simple yet elegant interiors. Nothing too fancy to distract you from the floor to ceiling views of the CBD and beyond. The restaurant opened into an open-air bar area with landscaped gardens. The bar encouraged us to linger. There were the panoramic views of the CBD and city skyline, tasty finger food, attractive cocktails and a DJ. We enjoyed the nibbles of harissa prawns and deep-fried olives paired with the house special JP Rizal and Four Pillars Gin and Tonic. Despite the high humidity of Singapore, the bar remained cool and comfortable through the smart use of a large overhead fan. As dusk approached, we were ushered to our table. There were too many interesting items on the a-la-carte menu so we decided on the "chef's surprise". The fate of our 3-course dinner with matching glasses of wine was in the hands of Chef Fernando and restaurant manager Marion. We were not disappointed. The cuisine style was primarily French. Every dish was technically well executed and flavors were finely balanced with nuances of Japan. Chef Fernando and his team articulated central ingredients without over complications, allowing natural flavors to shine. Each dish introduced delicious textures and flavors to our palates.  For example, the clean, soft and moist tooth fish, accentuated by the sweetness of the chervil root puree was a contrast to the crunchy textures of the grilled leeks and the light citrus in the pork broth.What seemed too be tuna wrapped in seaweed at first glance was a roll of marbled Iberico pork, cooked to a tender medium paired with sweet and tart overtones from thin slices of apples. The Japanese peach-like meringue dome dessert cracked open to reveal berry flavors and crunchy macadamia paired with a dollop of ice cream exuding the fragrance of rose and tang of vinegar.Service was impeccable, from the jovial delivery at the outdoor bar, to the fine dining table service indoors. Special thanks to Marion and Iain who explained and checked our satisfaction of every dish. They also diligently aligned cutlery after each course, refilled water and presented the wines. Prices were reasonable taking into account the quality of chef sourced ingredients from sustainable producers, attentive service, conducive dining environment and amazing views.We've been fortunate to dine at many awarded restaurants around the world and Artemis certainly delivered a high quality product that warrants a closer observation by Michelin inspectors. We've added this venue to our Singapore favorite list and look forward to our next visit with friends

I celebrated my birthday with my Husband at Artemis. We found the appetisers grilled mushrooms, a special item for the day, chargrilled otupus and crab salad really tasty. However, we were disappointed with the mains Hamachi and Venison loin especially the hamachi as the flavours of the fish did not come out very well. We are happy with the generous food portions though. We found the wine selection extensive and we each ordered a glass of Sauvignon and Merlot and they were also to our liking The service was also friendly and attentive which helped make our dining experience enjoyable. Overall, it's a satisfactory dining experience which has some rooms for improvement.
5
I enjoy going to Artemis for the fantastic view and the wonderful innovative cocktails. I also love the organic corn-fed chicken infused with different spices and tasty seabass sashimi!
3
I really enjoyed the starters at this place but I was disappointed by the main courses. They were out of the couple of mains when we dined which was a disappointment, considering we came here mid week and it was not too busy
3
We had to wait in the bar area for our table for about 10 minutes and then the service was very slow. The food was fine but nothing special given the price tag of $295 for 4 people with no one drinking alcohol.
4
Nice view over the Marina Bay, good food for the price. Not the cheapest place in Singapore, however with the view and the nice service I think that it was a very successfully visit.
5
Had several times business lunch at Artemis. Bright space, exceptional view and elegant design.Food is very good. The design of the dishes, the tastes are excellent. The wine selection has also interesting things. The service is also good. The price is on the high side but it is good product, great dishes and great place.
5
Celebrate my GF birthday at there. Overall I am satisfied with their services and food.There are outdoor and indoor in the restaurant. Outdoor is more happening (with DJ playing music) and I will suggest your guy having meal indoor if you wish have a environment which can chit chat with your friend.
5
This was my third visit and it was a whole different world from the first two (not that they were bad). The views speak for themselves but what really wowed was the impeccable, warm service and excellent food, creatively interpreted by the chef. Some mains were a bit pricey but on the whole well worth the experience.
4
I went last night for dinner. Food was very good. I enjoyed it very much. The fish was cooked very well. Wine selection was quite good. View was also excellent. Service was not the best. I had to wait 10 minutes for a bill. Plus, seeing people making out at their table is a bit akward
2
Ordered the wagyu carpaccio for starters, which was a total miss. There's a reason why regular carpaccio uses the leanest cut. There's simply too much fat in wagyu to make it appetising when eaten raw. Also, the beef slices were presented in rolls, which seems more like a hotpot, and defeats the purpose of having thin slides of beef in the first place. The seasoning was also strange (sour and tarte) and lacklustre, with zero arugula or Parmesan cheese to accompany the beef. Thankfully, the main course was a bit better. I ordered the duck breast, which was cooked medium and well seasoned. However, the duck breast lay on top of a paste which I could only describe as similar to raw cheesecake. Nevertheless, this tasted much better than the disappointing starter. We also ordered cocktails, where I had a gin tonic. Unfortunately, it tasted really watered down. Service was alright, although overbearing at times as the waiter was very snooty. When I requested for the duck to be medium well (I dislike it when duck is bloody) as opposed to his suggestion of medium rare, he gave me a look as if I just insulted his mother. Overall, this would be an okay restaurant if you're dining on company card. The view is not bad, but there are better restaurants food-wise in the area with similar views. Given the price they charge (around $120 per person for our meal sans dessert), I would not return again as the experience was definitely not worth it.
5
We had dinner at Artemis during our recent visit in Singapore. We made reservation online and requested a table by the window with bay view. Our request was granted! The night views from our table were gorgeous. Our host was super friendly and attentive. He explained the menu and gave recommendation. We had for starter French oysters, Wagyu beef carpaccio, wild seabass sashimi, and lobster tagliolini, for main course Wagyu striploin, and black cod in yuzu and pork broth, for side dish chargrilled broccolini and roasted bone marrow, and for dessert basil sponge cake and passion fruit ice-cream. All dishes were excellent in terms of taste and presentation. The wild seabass sashimi was fresh and succulent, so as the black cod. The Wagyu beef was tender and full of flavour. The ambience was delightful. It was an extremely enjoyable evening
4
I really enjoy bringing family, frienda and work colleagues to Artemis. The view never fails to impress. Good food and friendly service rounds up a great dining experience. Look for Ian :)
5
Excellent place for drinks or dinner outdoor or indoor with a great view on the Marina and cbd and a good service! All of us really appreciated
4
Fantastic service, the beef was "to die for", the king crab starter was fresh and light, the ambience wonderful
I am coming back soon
4
This is our first visit and the place and food did not disappoint. We are definitely coming back! Would like to try the outdoor next visit.
4
Great ambience, great vibe. But a mismatch in concept - soft lighting but there was table of infants next to us. Great service, good attention to detail. Food was good but not excellent. The wine selection was also good and reasonably priced. I'll come back for sure
3
I have dined in this restaurant 3 times and the last 2 visits this month was disappointing. To be fair the staff tried very hard but the lunch crowd was probably too large for them to cope. The quality of food is very good and the plating was nice although serving between courses took quite long. I was not happy that there was no indication of added cost for certain selections in the set menu. So don't be surprised that the cost of the meal can be much higher than you expected. If not for this, I would rate this restaurant very good
5
I've been up to Artemis a few times. I haven't had the chance to sample the food yet (I hear nothing but good) but the bar is great...stunning views, attentive and friendly service, broad drinks list which are served with style. Highly recommend for a quiet drink with atmosphere.
5
I haven't had a better meal in Singapore. The "top end" in this town can often leave you wishing you'd stuck with Plan-A and gone to a food court. But not Artemis. Great kitchen and cellar, superb staff. The outdoor bar will be seeing me again too. Not even going to mention the view. Go
5
Located on the 40th floor in the CBD, the restaurant has great views of the city. The Food is from the Mediterranean, beautifully cooked. Every dish we had was exceptional. We started with the charcuterie platter, my main dish was the slow- cooked pork-- fall off the bone delicious. My dinner companions had the black cod, duck and tenderloin. We added a side of chicken liver with truffles that was amazing
4
came here for lunch with friends. lovely view of city from the 40th floor. easy to locate, parking in building itself and near to MRT (raffles). love the decor. however, the low ceiling makes it very noisy - the place was packed. there are also 2 private dining rooms. same view, separated by a sliding partition - i wonder if that's sound proof. any way the 2 servers (1 girl and 1 guy) we had are very good. very attentive, friendly and nice. they do not wear name tags, and i forgot to ask their names. but a shout out to them - we really think you are great. we had the 2 course set lunch which we shared among the 3 of us. wonderfully presented and cooked - it was a totally delightful lunch, apart from the noise. menu changes monthly i was told
3
This is my second visit to this place. View and atmosphere are as nice and cozy as usual. Staffs are friendly and accommodating. However, the duck breast which was highly recommended by the staff was a bit too oily.
5
Ambience was elegant & cosy with a great view of the city skyline.
The food was delicious & the staff were tentative & so accommodating.
Thank you for making our evening a great one.
5
Cocktails are definitely a MUST try! Not watered down or served in mini scale proportions! Which makes the price justifiable!
5
Nice view, good food and excellent service. Was there to celebrate my wife birthday and we had enjoyed the view, food and ambience.
4
Good ambience with a great view for dinner. The bread is good; we had the crab salad and octopus as appetisers. Main courses were slow cook pork and Angus tenderloin. All tasted great. The draft beer was ok only.
4
Both of us enjoyed the cuisine except for the Duck Tartar. The lighting could be slightly brighter. Will recommend friends.
4
Amazing food, great service and very attentive staffs. My Mother enjoyed the terrific view of Singapore. So much attention to details including food and drinks. We LOVE IT!
4
Went to Artemis for lunch with a colleague. The view is as good as any in Singapore. Good menu and the food was well prepared. Th wine list seems extensive but we did not drink. The ambiance is a little like in hotel restaurant though. I would come here for a business meeting but not with my partner or friends
5
Besides the modern stylish ambience and the cool outdoor bar with stunning views over the Spore bay, the food is the most exciting entertainment in this upscale but easy going gourmet heaven. Even the "have seen and tasted it already" tongues under us will get surprised faces when they go through the courses. Top meat and seafood quality prepared to the point, creative combinations of flavours and just fantastic souces, creams, foams and wraps. It is a firework of tastes which you shouldnt miss on a Spore trip and which you wouldnt forget either. We came and will come again. Congrats to the Columbian Chef, he brought his interpretation of a french and mediterranen cuisine on the table and adds some courageous personallity
5
Certainly a great place for business lunch. At the top of the newly opened CapitaGreen building near Raffles Place, this French Mediterranean inspired cuisine is really unique in Singapore. Great views towards Marina Bay and the city skyline while very fine dining but not at excobitant prices. Set menu is reasonable. Dishes very much on the creative side but maybe a little bit on the too small-portion side. Definitively a meal and setting worth to remember. At night, the bar is open for after-hours outdoor drinks. Will return
4
I had a pleasant dinner there with my wife to celebrate her Bday.
Window seat is arranged and we enjoyed the wonderful view in the whole dinner experience.
The service and food is great, but just a bit overpriced, to be frank.
4
Ordered the steak, came done perfectly medium rare. Loved the potato sides. All in all, about what I expected, pricey, but then Singapore restaurants are always overpriced. One of the better meals with a view in center of business district
5
Amazing ambiance. Relaxing & Elegant, romantic & classy. Top quality produce thus top quality food. However, I believe Artemis can improve in their customer service. Prompt service will compliment top quality food.
5
I love trying new restaurants or gastronomic events in Singapore as I am quite a foodie. After the Sustainable Seafood Dinner of last night, Artemis has really become one of my favorites! Not only was the food unusual (razor clams & sea urchin pasta, smoked eel & white asparagus...) but it was truly excellent! The Chef must have spent a lot of time creating the menu as every dish was close to perfection. Really looking forward the next Artemis Foodie event! :-
4
Loved the view & hospitality of Artemis! We ordered the Fadi Organic Chicken and it was worth the wait- deliciously prepared two ways & ridiculously flavorful. Definitely my top recommendation. Food-wise, we also ordered the assorted cured meats (Delish!) however the duck breast & ice cream degustation were a little underwhelming for me.
5
We loved our romantic meal experience on the rooftop of this wonderfull skyscraper. The bar has some insane Gin cocktails. After a couple of drinks we went to the restaurant where we had an amazing meal with a great view of Singapore. If you have a special occasion to celebrate and you are looking for delicious food with a city view I would recommend you give this place a try. The price can be punchy but the food quality and service is of the highest level.
5
CONCEPT: restaurant serving great Mediterranean food and cocktails, on the 40th floor of the Capita Green tower (CBD). Beautiful view on the MBS. Definitely coming again soon!FOOD: everything was so tasty & fresh! We ordered gem lettuce and burrata salad, grilled octopus, duck with fruits & yoghurt sauce. Dessert was the best part - the strawberry dome will make me come back!BEVERAGES: very nice cocktail menu! large choice of gin & tonic - nice place to come for an afterwork in your office is in the CBD.SERVICE: very nice & efficient staff (although difficult to attract their attention when you want something)PRICE: reasonable for the quality/location of this restaurant (240 sgd for 2, including drinks
5
The food was simply perfect. So well thought through, absolutely delicious. Service was impeccable too. The staff really cares, especially ESPECIALLY Iain. Upon finding out that my boyfriend is relocating, he did something really sweet by giving him a farewell cake. It's our 2nd visit already and Iain really made our experience wholly enjoyable.
5
Each special occasion, we always look for a good restaurant to celebrate the occasion. After we narrowed down our list we finally decided to book table for 4 at Artemis Grill. It did not disappoint at all. From Appetizer to Main Course to Dessert ..all that we order truly satisfy our palate. Some dishes we ordered were Alaskan crab and beetroot for appetizer then Pork Loin and Tenderloin for main course . Service is prompt and friendly too ! I consider the overall price is fair for its F&B and service quality .
5
First time I tried Artemis for lunch.As usual, the food was excellent! New spring creations from Chef Fernando and pastry chef Elena are excellent!You have to try the asparagus, the wagyu beef cheeks and the basil & lemon cake... so yummy!Price is really reasonable for the quality we getLast but not least, the service is perfect as always! We won't for lunch and for 3 course menu, we spent only 1h!Definitely a place to go
5
Went for dinner with my wife on our wedding anniversary.
Staff were very accommodating and service was excellent.
The food, wine and spectacular view made for a wonderful dining experience.
Will return again!
5
Amazing food love every dishes. Staff super nice been really helpful with good service mind. Me and boyfriend enjoyed a lot.
5
Service was really good, excellent to be exact! Had a really happy and pleasant meal there. My guests were very surprised with their food presentation and totally enjoyed their meal.
5
The restaurant was absolutely amazing. Attentive service staff, awesome food, and great view of the city skyline at night!
4
Been here a few times on business lunches and personal dining. Have not been disappointed. Friendly service staff, very attentive - great food, and wonderful clear views of the Marina Bay area. Do book early if you want to have a table by the window.
4
The service was very pleasant, the food excellent. We were only unfortunate to sit next to the door which leads to the outside bar, and that door opens and closes with some noise....so when I book next time, I will make sure NOT to be given that table....quite disruptive
4
There are two places in Singapore where I bring my out of town visitors and Artemis is one them. The views especially in the evenings are spectacular. The food is excellent with a fantastic selection of appetisers; mains and desserts. It was Singapore cocktail week so enjoyed a great gin based drink. The service is usually pretty good and the staff are very thoughtful if you are celebrating a birthday. I'll be back.
5
Enjoyred a lovely meal for two to celebrate my birthday. The service was excellent which is rare in Singapore, the food enjoyable and the sommelier provided excellent advice and good recovery after our selected wine was unavailable. Great outlook over Marina Bay provided a nice setting for the evenin
4
The food at Artemis was excellent but we had to wait for 40 minutes to get our appetizers with another delay for mains. Worth the wait for the food but would rather not wait. Staff were very nice providing some complimentary dishes while we waited. All in all we would come back
4
Went with my husband to celebrate his birthday. Server was well versed with the menu and able to make good recommendations. The wine recommendation turned out very well. Appetizers were nicely presented and tasty. I felt they were better tasting and presented than main course. Slightly disappointed with my entree, as the portion was small and was not hot when brought out. Overall good experience and will return.
4
Nice coctails and good happy hour deal in an exclusive atmosphere with an elevated view. Friday after work hours is crowded with professionals. A little too loud music on the terrace lounge.
5
Nice food, nice view, nice service.
Tenderloin was a bit salty on the outside, but otherwise, everything else was fantastic.
1
Not advisable for lunch if you do not have more than 1.5 hours to spare - Waiting time for food serving is close to an hour.
5
I had the best chicken liver in my life and the octopus salad is magnificent. They do have a lovely set lunch menu too...just go for it...
5
As usual , Artemis food and service does not disappoint . We opted for the set and added the grilled octopus ,a must.Artemis is Creative in their menu and uses fresh seasonal produce . Staff are well trained and groomed .I love the views too . I will be there again for sure . Keep it up Artemis 
5
The view from the restaurant was wonderful (make sure to request for a table by the window!) The servers were friendly and the food was tasty. We ordered the lamb rump, venison and wagyu steak. The wagyu steak was a little too fat but yummy all the same. We wanted to try the roasted bone marrow but sadly it was sold out.
5
Had a great dinner with my love one for his birthday celebration. We went there pretty early and was attended by a humouros lady who usher us to our seats. The food was well-prepared with thoughtfully selected ingredients. The foods served was fresh & delicious, especially their appetizers alaskan king crab. Highly recommended for dishes like duck breast & iberico pork. The view was awesome & perfect with a glass of cocktail. It's heartwarming to know staff have prepared complimentary slice of birthday cake for the birthday guest. By the way, the cake was nice too. Overall, we had a great experience with Artemis & definitely will come back again. Cheers! :)
3
The lovely reception greeted us in a cheery tone the moment we stepped off the lift. Service was attentive, friendly and delightful throughout. The young man who served us was very hospitable, he definitely added to the meal experience. However, the food did not live up to expectations. We ordered beef - angus and veal. In our opinion, both missed the cut. Maybe it's just our own tastebuds playing tricks on us, but anyway we shall find another opportunity to return to try the food one more time
4
Had a business lunch with a main client of ours. Perfect atmosphere to do so, the tables are far apart therefore can have proper conversations. The views are amazing, the food is good for its price.5* for atmosphere and views4* for food and value4* for servic
5
We had an assortment of very tasty , well prepared starters . Loved the fact that ingredients used were organic. The beet root salad and grilled octopus both get the starter award!!Between the steak , cod and pork mains that we shared , I can't say which was best cos they were ALL YUMMY !The gentlemen that served our table were chatty , knowledgeable and friendly , making the overall dinner a satisfyingly HAPPY evening.Round of applause to the team at Artemis grill !
5
The food is excellent, view is fabulous, service is brilliant. If you want to impress your other half, this is a place you have to visit 👍🏻
4
The outdoor was great to chill but it was a pity cos it rained last night so we have to sit indoor but overall it was still a perfect night. Except the toilet part will be better if they revamp it.
5
Love this place. Excelent view, good quality food and service staff are very professional. Have dined a couple of times and each visit was definitely and enjoyable dining experience. Good venue for business lunches/dinners.

I had a business lunch at Artemis which was the 2 course meal for the day. The main was good but the panna cotta desert was excellent. The sommelier also recommended a very good glass of wine and the service was fantastic. I would recommend Artemis for a dinner date - the view at night would be spectacular. Do make reservations as it can be crowded
5
Artemis was such a great experience! The view was great, we went during sunset (: The food was amazing (wagyu beef omg) and the service was excellent. it was also my (and my dad's) birthday and they prepared 2 slices of cake with candles and a Happy Birthday written in chocolate for us (: Super great experience, will definitely retur

I've been coming to Artemis, for lunch, dinner & drinks on many occasions, and felt it was time i shared my review. The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing - no one can deny their view over MBS is the best. The staff are super friendly & welcoming... Rico the Bar Manager often remembers my drink of choice. The cuisine is fresh and delicious, and Chef Fernando offers a refined cuisine that i haven't sampled anywhere else in Singapore
4
One of the higher end restaurants in Singapore but reasonable. Food is very good and great execution. Staff are trained very well and they look after the clientele.Really liked that they could do a lobster pasta starter very well and in the right small portion. The open air bar next to the well laid out indoor dining area works well and is a nice place to have a drink before dinner. Certainly recommendable
4
Overall wonderful experience. Love the black cod, octopus, bread, and the complimentary birthday cake.Lamb rump - meat still got a fair amount of gristle and white fats. Meat quite dry and not tender enough.The Grape Divine - We both find that this cocktail is not sweet enough.
5
Excellent service, one of the best meals we have had in Singapore. We were able to relax in the outdoor bar enjoying the views of Singapore before moving inside to our table with an amazing view of the city. The staff were so helpful and lovely, and the food was unbelievable. A must for visitors to Singapore for not only great food but amazing views
5
I've patronised the restaurant at Artemis many times before but I was pleasantly surprise to discover recently the cocktail bar on the terrace. The staff is super friendly and the quality of the cocktails prepared is excellent. Kudos to the bar manager: Rico for creating this environment.
4
Wonderful view of MBS at night. Delicious appetisers of crab and octopus, average mains. Good service, great ambience for date night. Open air bar with nice views and large fans, for after dinner drinks with a cool Breeze.
5
Was speechless of the excellent service provided to us that evening. We had a wonderful time! Thank you! The food and desserts were amazing as well!
4
I've been to Artemis quite a number of times.Last night it was to celebrate a special birthday. Lots of great wine and excellent food and service.
4
The food and the service were great. A pity that the personal did not realize that this was my mother's birthday even though I mentioned it during the reservation. A happy birthday from the chef de service would have made this dinner outstanding.
5
We finally made it to Artemis the other night. We had a fabulous time. We met for drinks beforehand at the outdoor bar at Artemis...easily one of the nicest outdoor bars overlooking MBS. Huge fans and the cool architecture created a constant cool breeze. The service was outstanding....attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. The food didn't disappoint either. We all enjoyed our dinner at Artemis. We will absolutely be back.
5
Beautiful views from the top of Singapore and a very nice atmosphere. Dishes were very nicely prepared and portion sizes even surprisingly big. The service was excellent from all of the staff and I felt really welcome here. The style of the food is maybe not super fine-dining, but I enjoyed it a lot - well prepared but not fancy for just the sake of being too fancy
5
I had lunch there and it was great. The wait staff know his stuff inside out, he is able to tell you how a certain dish is cooked, what's in it, etc. And I would like to take this chance to compliment Ian, because he was part of the reason why the lunch experience was amazing. The food was great and not overpriced.
5
Siti accommodated my request for a quiet corner as it was a business lunch with overseas clients. My clients were impressed with the arrangement and the view was breath of fresh air for them. Service staff were attentive and friendly and could make recommendations. Food portions weren't too large so everyone could have dessert and not fall into a food coma post lunch. Would recommend booking in advance as it does get crowded
4
My husband recommended this place to celebrate my birthday and he usually went Artemis for his company's drinking session. Thus, we were both new to this place for dinner! We were satisfied with the waiter's service and his knowledge in the food. The food were all amazing. We ordered the chargrilled octopus, Alaskan King crab salad for starter and we had Black cod and tenderloin for our main. Thumbs up for all and i rated 4.5 /5 for the overall dinning experience. The view is nice just that we regretted not to put in our request upon reservation for a window sit which overlooks the Singapore flyer and MBS. We put in our request to the waiter and failed to get a window seat despite we asked for it. The seats were empty even when our main course were served and i was a little disappointed with their service level of not putting in the extra miles for us. Nevertheless, i will still go back for their food
4
Ok, so we got off to a bad start. The first 2 wines we chose were not available. We then got told we had been given the wrong wine list which had been changed the same day. New wine list in hand, our first choice was also not available. Kiss and make up time. After the dodgy start, it was all good. The standout dish was my venison loin. Cooked to perfection. My wife's Welsh lamb also got the thumbs up. As usual, we passed on puds (too full). The staff were very professional and friendly.There is a Spanish influence lurking in the background at Artemis. Those in the know will spot it. Very subtle. The bread is outstanding. Try them all! A great dining experience with awesome views
3
Great place, great view and great food. However the coordination of drinks, vine and food was terrible and we had to cancel the drinks as the vine came before the drinks.
4
Good experience with the restruant! Great view and food without burning your pocket! Thumbs up for their service too
5
Great food, staff & environment! Brought some out of town clients and they loved it! Will definitely make it a regular place for client lunches/dinners.
5
Excellent choice for business lunch.
Service was a amazing - manager and wait staff are incredibly proactive and accommodating.
We will go back!
5
Best restaurant in the city! What a pleasant discovery,i had heard rave reviews of this place from friends and even with the hype,the place did not disappoint.The service was amazing and made the experience all the better.
5
I would highly recommend taking your guests to Artemis. They have the best oysters and the entire evening was just perfect-- from the location to the service & food.
4
Good food, nice view, great service which is not always the case in Singapore for this kind of upscale places. Unfortunately a bit too expensive.
5
It cannot be easy to market a restaurant hidden away on top of a business building. You have to be good and happy to say, at Artemis they are excellent. For us, it was a most perfect dinner. From the reservation taking by Sherry, to the warm welcome, the truly spectacular setting and great vistas, to an interesting, well balanced menu with fair prices, to great service and delicious food - Artemis has it. I wish to particularly mention our service attendant Ian, who impressed us greatly with his highly professional, confident, pleasant and courteous service. To complete and balance the review three minor negatives. First, we disliked that there is no carbonated water such as Perrier or Pellegrino available - only the home made mix. Second, the black Maroccon spice served with the olive oil and the excellent bread selection does not fit this type of restaurant and actually destroys the pleasure of tasting the fine bread they serve. Third, meant well but wrong was that my dinner plate was removed whilst my wife was still eating her main course. Compliments to the Artemis team
5
Had our Valentine’s Day dinner there but didn’t expect the awesome breathtaking view of the Marina Bay area, best timing 7pm and dine till 8:30pm. We will catch the different lighting of the Bay view. The Food and the staff were top notch, friendly and welcoming ambiance. Our food arrived in very good time and was well presented, hot and in sufficient amounts to satisfy. The desserts were lovely. Prices clearly vary dependent upon what you select, but there's enough choice to cater for everyone's budget. It's best to book as they are popular, but you're not rushed.Would highly recommend this restaurant if you’re dining as a couple
4
A great view from the top floor of CapitaGreen, and location-wise is perfect for those in the Raffles place area. Food is very good - my guest and I shared an appetiser (grilled octupus), I had the sea bass and he had the lamb rump. All very well done, and we like the way the service staff comes around regularly with a tray of bread choices
5
Amazing views, food was good. Ambience was just nice. Outdoor bar was slightly small but good enough for the 4 of us to chill.
Planning my next visit already.
4
This was my 2nd visit, will return for dinner next time! The food is good and well presented. Wine selection is very good too.
4
Staff were very attentive, no need to call them as they will always be attentive to your needs throughout your meal.
5
Good place for date night. View is good, decor is good, cocktails were well crafted and service was also attentive. We will go back.
5
The atmosphere is gordios, the service fine and the food is delicius.
The outlook from the restaurant is fantastic too.
5
We've heard some raving reviews about Artemis Grill and finally made the time to try it out with my husband. Service was commendable and the food just blown us away. Every course we ordered was close to perfection coupled with spectacular view of the marina bay. Overall, it was awesome and we will definitely be back again : 
5
I was set with the task to find a restaurant that serves/caters for gluten free. Which Artemis does, it also caters for vegetarians. They offer a 2 course set lunch or a 3 course set lunch. We were greeted by a friendly member of staff and taken to a table which had a beautiful view of the Marina.My friend and I both had two courses, she had a main course and dessert and I had a starter and main course.I normally don't order chicken in a restaurant because it can be dry, but the chicken I was served was delicious. In fact every course was a delicious and so was the house white wine. I would recommend this restaurant.
5
A casual fine dining experience high up in the sky. Had a combination of 4 interestingly created starters, out of which the chefs special Hamachi with avocado mousse was exceptional folllowed by a perfectly seared fillet for mains. Our dessert to share - Mille Feuille with Apple compote, Stilton icecream and calvados cream was the perfect end. Will definitely be back!
4
Located in the 40th floor in Capita green, they have dedicated lift from front lobby directly to the restaurant.The outdoor bar is not too big but looks nice, with 2 big fan. Better do reservation before you come to the bar. We got nice table in the corner and headed directly to Marina Bay Sands.Happy hours time is until 7PM, quiet good selection too
4
Artemis is naturally beautiful being located on the TOP floor of capitagreen. Make reservation. Both lunch and dinner can be packed and u don't wanna be disappointed having made all your way up and not get a seat. Inespecial letting the gorgeous night view of the Singapore cbd slip you by. Of course the view would have been even more fantastic if the buildings in front were much shorter. But still alright.Get a window seat especially if you go with a date to impress. There are plenty of choices to choose here. I went for the oyster naturale to start followed by a Alaskan king crab salad and the mains, I went with the slow cooked iberico pork...mind blowing! Loved the juiciness and tenderness of the meat. Flavors all well locked in and punctured all my senses. And I had the pear tart to finish my meal. Plenty of wines to choose here.And they do private dining events with wine pairing. And set lunch menus good value for the quality of food offered here.Great location... being almost at doorstep of mrt stations for those who don't drive, great view and great food and above all, great service! Well especially when they are not so packed.
5
Incredible view overlooking the famous Marina Bay Sands landmark. With a variety of beverages and food to choose from.
Excellent service!
5
After calling up last minute to organise a table the service was great. The bar connects well to the restaurant and has a nice view of the marina. Excellent food!
4
Totally pleasant. Sets the mood for an unassuming just right service and good food.
It's like an old rich rather than noveau rich ambience - cool and calm. Perfect pitch!
5
Wonderful food and spectacular view of financial district and Marina Bay Sands. Stay afterwards for a drink...
5
We booked for Artemis on our first night in Singapore.
The ambience is very elegant and the staff very kind.
The food was delicious, and the view is amazing!!
Is pricey, but worth it
We couldn´t have started better in this city!
5
We went here for my wife's 50th birthday and we were not disappointed. The food was delicious and the views are amazing. Staff were very attentive. Would highly recommend going here for a special dinner
4
Had a private dining event in Artemis recently. You can expect the view to be breathtaking because of its location. Importantly, the staff at Artemis are extremely helpful and attentive. Special shout out to Sheri, who attended to me when I rang the following day to make a personal booking and she was very polite and professional in explaining their predicaments over a request I made. Definitely an excellent place for drinks to wind down after the day and pamper yourself with quality food and not over the top price
5
A friend introduced us to Artemis - it's on the top of an office in the CBD - quite a hidden place. I guess during the working week it's quite a busy business lunch restaurant. The view is sensational, interior beautiful, service excellent, and most of all the food was absolutely delicious. It has a good atmosphere which made for a lovely pre-xmas night out with friends
4
A great thank you to Arnott, Janice Sharmila, Iain and the rest for such an amazing experience dinner. Good recommendations of food and pairing of wines from Arnott. He even allowed us to have soup which was not in the menu, which was very good soup! Sharmila and Iain has never failed to uplift our expectations and mood while serving us with smiles at all times and allowed us to change our orders for desserts! Overall, it was a wonderful experience to dine in with an exceptional service. Well done everyone :
5
As a local Singaporean I often hesitate to write reviews of restaurants here because I don't think tourists would traipse to the suburbs for good food. So I'm really happy to write a review of Artemis Grill, which is located in the CBD area, nearer the "touristy" part of Singapore. The building in which the restaurant is located has been featured in a BBC article "Ten of the world's most incredible rooftops", and in fact the restaurant is at the top of this building (CapitaGreen).On to the review itself - The food here was extremely well-presented, and we experienced what I can only call "taste explosions" (in the best possible way) with every bite! The servers were enthusiastic and knowledgeable. One even suggested a more adventurous dessert than we would have normally gone for and we enjoyed it very much. Top marks all around! Their sky bar looked gorgeous too, and after dinner you can take a turn around the rooftop garden located just next to the restaurant. Eating out in restaurants in Singapore can be pricey, and certainly the Artemis Grill is not inexpensive, but I definitely felt that the quality of the cooking made it worth every penny. Very highly recommended
5
Excellent food service and atmosphere sommelier one of the most knowledgeable ever encountered. Listen to her interesting suggestions. Honest reliable and spot on. She will not try to persuade you to buy the most expensive wines she just knows the best!
5
Seated beside the windows,
the view was spectacular. Good service, great food and atmosphere. Definitely recommend.
3
Nice place , beautiful view . Food average. Suitable for business lunch. I think dinner will be better.
5
Went during Xmas eve and they have Wonderful service and Pleasant atmosphere. Food is great and there's a nice view.
5
The food is stunning, the ingredients are so fresh, the city views are amazing.
It was a business meeting, but I can have a romantic date with my wife as well lunch or dinner.
On the expensive side ;)
4
Very enjoyable dinner. Service was good and food ordered was excellent. The menu could have been wider in choice
5
We had a wonderful Christmas dinner at Artemis. Service and food , wine are fantastic! It's over $1000 for 5 of us, but it was worth a lot.
5
This is my second time at Artemis for a business meeting / lunch and the place exceeds expectations. The menu has a selection of well-known favorites as well as seasonal offerings. There's a good range of mains to choose from. The pork chop and the lamb that we ordered were great. The dishes were served in good timing and at the correct temperature. The staff was very attentive even with the drinks refill and with the menu suggestions. The restaurant is worth a visit --- it has a killer combination of great food, courteous staff and a breathtaking view of the city (definitely gorgeous at night
2
We had a group booking for 12. Took 40 minutes to get the drinks organised and the wait staff had to be chased up several times to take the food order. Food was average for the price. Olive oil ice cream was not a hit. Lovely fit out and stunning views. I'd put this down to an off night but it was quite a disappointing experience. Worse thing was the management and staff knew things were not going too well but nothing was said to our host
4
Our regional leadership team celebrated our year-end dinner at Artemis, a fairly new restaurant in Singapore atop CapitaGreen. It was a very pleasant Saturday evening and we started it strolling the "forest" at the top followed by cocktails on the terrace as the sun set on the Singapore skyline. We then went indoors for dinner, continuing to enjoy a very nice view though we were a couple of tables away from the glass windows. The service was very good and the set menu offered for our dinner party was very pleasant, with well-presented appetizers and soup, followed by a steak or fish main. The food is more French-style. We chose a very good Haut Medoc wine to go with the meal which everyone enjoyed.This is a very good place for dates or formal gatherings for family or business
5
Some of the best drinks in all of Singapore. Rico is an amazing bartender and has definitely increased the quality and complexity of drinks (and taste).
4
Great place for business lunch due to the view and ambience. Although price was a bit expensive, food quality was good!
5
Great place for a business lunch or special meal. Artemis never fails to deliver brilliantly tasty food.
5
Great views, menu, pairings and service. For business lunch or dinner get together Artemis is top shelf.
5
The healthy tasty food and service at this rooftop Mediterranean restaurant keeps me coming back. Organic meats and wonderful interesting salads. The amazing view from the rooftop also complements the experience
5
Have visited there two times.
The organic chicken in the restaurant is fantastic! Meantime, the wine is also good.
Very good view as well at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Friendly waiters and waitresses as well.
Pleasant dining experience.
4
Birthday dinner + anniversary celebration and Artemis did not disappoint. Fantastically romantic leisurely experience with great food and service.
5
We tried it several times for lunch and drinks on a terrace. Fantastic view from the roof of Capita Green. A reliable option for lunch with excellent Italian cuisine, nice ambience and good service, especially if you need to organise it easy and quick for the business meeting (reserve, please).The bar on the terrace is nice if you're lucky with the table. Have a walk in a small garden - looks quite and peaceful, offering stunning views over the city
5
Very nice restaurant in the top floor of a high building. The view is great. There is good music and the service is very friendly. On the roof top there is also a bar that becomes a night club. The food is very good a mix of sea food fish and good meat. We really enjoyed it.
4
Artemis Grill is indeed a cut above its peers in the category of fine dining. Not only is it literally above its competitors (located on the 40th floor), the fusion of ingredients for each of the dish was well thought out. The wine pairing done by the in-house sommelier for every single course, definitely enhanced the overall dining experience
5
The place is very nice, with a wonderful view. The food was innovative and very tasty : I took the guinea fowl with a chocolate sauce : original and delicious ! Service was perfect.
This restaurant is inevitable in Singapore !
5
Excellent meal with excellent view and impeccable service. Couldn't fault anything about our experience there
5
We had a fantastic dinner with my wife at Artemis Grill. The view was definitely one to behold but the atmosphere and the excellent service was a plus as well :)
3
There isn't much to choose from and the serving is small. The octopus salad I had was a tad salty. The serving staff was attentive.
5
Excellent food and amazing view of Singapore. The chef perfectly accommodated special dietary requirements with amazing food that was also great to look at. Go and try!
4
Excellent venue with great view. Good selection of sea food including grilled octopus, sea bass, and king prawns. Wide selection of wines. $100 per person without dessert.
5
View was excellent, service was exceptional. Brought my partner there for her birthday meal and upon knowing it is her birthday, the waiter treated us a birthday cake on the house. Though the food portion was abit small, the taste and quality of the food ordered was really good. Thank you Artemis for making it a wonderful night for both of us
5
Food definitely to die for. A table at the window allows for great views. You are going to need appetisers, the portions for the main were for my main (Iberico Pork) smaller than the appetiser. After both, we were happy with the taste but still a bit hungry so dessert was a must. There are worse things to must do, but we just hadn't expected mains to be that small. Service was great, waiters knowledgeable and friendly. Overall a lovely night for us as a couple. Not so sure whether I would be comfortable taking a business partner there unless it was a group of people
5
Evening at Artemis was lovely with the impeccable appearance of the staff and well presented plate of yummlisous dinner by Chef.Appreciated it.Many thanks to the attentive staff : Sam, Iain, Fairus , Arun= Good job, guys!! And Rico for taking care of us overall.See you guys again : D x
4
Really enjoyed our recent meal here. It is pricey of course but the quality and choice of food and wine is excellent. The view is stunning over Marina Bay Sands and the harbour. Would be 5 stars but the service was a little lacking on the night we were there. Highly recommended though for that special romantic meal.
5
Booked a table for 6 to celebrate a friend's birthday one time and another time brought friends to unwind after a Long day at work . Great experience all around on both occasions. Great view, foods good, amazing drinks, excellent service. Will come back!
5
Artemis is a well located restaurant in the heart of Singapore's business district, with a great view on the Marina Bay. The staff is well trained, the food is great, and there's a nice outside area for drinks
4
Even though it was a rainy day we still enjoyed the view from our table. Happy hour drinks were good value and the food, while on the expensive side, was really tasty. The staff were not quite as attentive as I might have hoped but it didn't detract from a lovely evening overall
3
My husband and I took his parents to dine at Artemis on their last night with us. We got a very good table near the window with superb views. Drinks were nice and the sharing platter of cured meats was fantastic. My mother in law and I ordered the pumpkin with gnocchi (don't remember the exact name of the dish), it was listed as a main course. We were a bit surprised when we got a small plate with 2 slices of pumpkin and 4 gnocchi.. we checked back with the waiter if he can bring some more gnocchi, but this wasn't possible so he offered us an additional side dish, but it would just not fit to order fries, puree or more veggies with our dishes. We got free desert in the end and some petit fours which was ok. Also, my husband and my father in law got 2 glasses of wine for free. Still, for that kind of restaurant I would have expected from the waiter to let us know in advance that our main courses were 'small portions'. He only told us once the plates were served. We had dinner at Artemis before and never experienced such things, so it was a bit disappointing
4
Very posh restaurant with professional service on the 40th floor. food was good and good wine too. of course comes at a price in Singapore. we had some salmon, rib eye grilled. was not outstanding, but was good. the view is just amazing as it gives a full scale photo of marina bay sands. have to say, portions are pretty small, but then its Asian specifications
4
When you arrive at Artemis, you would be forgiven for thinking you just stepped into mid town Manhattan or even London. I didnt see more than one or two locals at this popular bankers' haunt located 40 stories up in Singapore's CBD. The outdoor terrace is a great place to just hang out with friends and Artemis's stash of drinking wines (as opposed to expensive collectors bottles) was reassuring. For dinner i rather enjoyed the Grilled Spanish Octopus with cherry tomatoes and black olives. Desert; Apple Mille Feuile and the Chocolate Praline were very acceptable but no gourmet experience. A great place to spend an evening
5
Ate here for a business dinner. Had the Guinea Fowl and it was outstanding 5/5. Cooked to perfection and with great artistry; and accompanying sides were delicious. Also ordered three additional sides for the table: cauliflower, potatoes and green beans. All around 5/5, atmosphere, service, presentation, food
5
Despite the obvious business atmosphere on a mid-week lunchtime, there was not a single raised eyebrow when 4 year old daughter was shown to her seat and treated just like every other guest. My wife (the birthday girl) was suitably impressed by the restaurant generally and the spectacular view across Marina Bay and MBFC. She has a number of dietary restrictions but there were more than enough choices on the menu to make life interesting. Additionally the chef kindly made a lactose-free sweet-potato puree for her as well. My 4 year old very much enjoyed her Steak Tartare, half of her mothers ceviche, and a tenderloin steak. My wife loved her [half] ceviche and rack of salt-marsh lamb; and I very much enjoyed the Iberico Pork chop which has a fantastic charcoal grill flavour. We were a little pushed for time so opted to skip desert. However, unbeknownst to us, the kitchen had put together a birthday surprise dessert for my wife (candle included). Being chocolate based, this went down very well with both my wife and daughter who proceeded to fight over it. This was a very thoughtful addition to what was undoubtedly a very good lunch
5
Really good service staff, friendly and followed up (after the booking) to say hi during dinner itself. They asked if it was a special occasion during the booking call, and gave us (what I thought) was the best seats in the house. complimentary dessert with birthday wishes without having to ask. good food at reasonable prices, great view, definitely going back.
5
Excellent food. Tho a coiple of times, the staff could be a little bit more attentive as a few of them were engrossed at one of the table and had to get their attention for a bit. Other than that, alls really reaaly good with food, views and service. Thks
4
Went to a media event in the outdoor area during ITB Asia. The view is incredible and the service was great. Will definitely go back and very recommended as a wow factor place.
5
Ive come to this bar a couple of times during the soft opening and loved it
Just came back and reminded myself need to come more
Never really over crowded like some places
Shame ive never tried the restaurant either
4
Anant, GM, is knowledgeable and has attention to details especially with patrons' needs. Wonderful half bottle selection
4
Absolute gastronomic dining with stunning view and commendable impeccable service.
Appreciate the lovely surprise of complimentary champagne.
5
I made a reservation at Artemis for my partners birthday in October. We arrived early to sit outside and take advantage of their happy hour, I highly recommend trying a 'dark and stormy'. The view from their outdoor bar is incredible. The staff managed to find us a seat at the viewing panel and couldn't have done anymore to make our time enjoyable. We moved indoors for dinner, a dimly lit and beautifully decorated restaurant. Again, the customer service we received was impeccable. We ordered starters, mains (steak) and three side dishes, each plate was delicious, cooked to perfection.A real treat for a special occasion, we will definitely return
5
I always believe that a great restaurant should provide not only service excellent food but the service should make anyone feel enjoyable and comfortable. Artemis indeed put great emphasis on service and our dinning experience is amazing. The service crews know all ingredients to each dishes and cocktails (super impress with a chatty young boy with braces). The mbs view only elevate the dinning experience. Cocktail we like: Tie me up teaDishes we love: Iberico pork and lamb rack (medium) Great service, great food and great view lead to great night :
5
I wanted to check out Artemis as my company and I recently shot an episode of TheMinuteList (theminutelist.com) for them. I thoroughly liked the atmosphere and was eager to check out the food too. I suggested it as my birthday dinner venue to my fam and I must say it was a really good experience. The service was good, the waiters were really courteous and accommodating (wish we got the name of our waiter - 5 stars for service!), the food was excellent too, and the environment was just right for a small birthday celebration for my family and I. We really enjoyed our visit to Artemis and hope to come back soon.
4
A chic bar greets you as you step out the lift, followed by the the fantastic view of the skyline . The food doesn't disappoint - the fig salad was fresh and flavorful , the pasta was just right . I ordered the mango and chestnut sorbet with hesitation as I am not a sorbet fan - what a pleasant surprise ! The refreshing mango sorbet within the smooth and buttery purÃ©ed chestnut. Unlike some restaurants in the vicinity that packs the tables too closely , the distance between the tables allowed for room for a nice chat or business conversation. Ask for a table by the window if you want an unobstructed view . I plan to return for drinks in the 'glasshouse ' area in the evenings .
5
My fav place in Singapore. Great happy hours price, great drinks and amazing cocktails! Music is perfect for the type of chill ambiance and best of the best is the service. It is rare in Singapore to find a place with that level of personalisation and care. I keep and will keep coming for sure :
4
I like really like the Fig salads n the organic grilled chicken there ... The oysters there are fresh too. I have very sensitive stomach so I am very selective when it comes to oyster. This place used to be very hot for lunch but I think they have done something to the full glass window , now it fine. Although they have good view, I personally will not want to be seated at the table next to the window as it is too glaring. Dinner is fine ..
4
Food was innovative and tasty. Service was a little slow. Amazing views from the window side tables and a great rooftop bar to enjoy drinks.
5
First time and will not be the last. Good choice for business lunch well cooked. Pork was outstanding
4
Would have given 5 stars but both times now, waiting for our coffee at the end of our meal took a really long time.
3
The ambience of this place is just great ! Service is also very good and the guys here are smartly dressed and very attentive. Food is just ok only.
4
This root-top restaurant at CapitalGreen has the impressive view and the whole setting is lovely. It is one of those special venues suitable for impressing a date, holding business meal or private event. The modern Mediterranean-inspired menu emphasizes on using premium grade imported produces. Dishes were well executed but a tad too modern for my preference. The restaurant is also a supporter of "sustainable food" - food that can continue to be produced without harming the environment. Accordingly, the vegetables are mostly organic, seafood are from sustainable sources and meat are hormone-free/not from feedlot. It has a full bar and good wine list. Service could be more organised but staff were friendly and tried hard. As expected, the impressive view and premium imported produces came with a price - averaged at S$200 per person with wine
5
If you just want a meal, well you can go anywhere. But if you want a complete dining experience that will leave you with memories that will last a lifetime whilst in Singapore, Artemis is really one of very few places you must put on your to do list. The menu is the finest you will get with service to match. The outdoor roof top bar delivers views as good as you will get but is unique due to it a location.Don't skip this venue. It's amazing
5
Chef Fernando Arevalo is a man with a mission. The USP of Artemis is the chef's commitment to the provenance of the produce. He uses absolutely the best at their peak. This may not come cheap but you will not done better anywhere as the chef understands what needs to be done to make the food shine. Make no mistake, Chef Arevalo is a perfectionist. I have eaten there three times and have never been disappointed. Set menu or a la carte, the chef is at the peak of his game. I will be returning many more times for sure. Service is friendly and efficient.

High rise dining with a spectacular view, great ambience, attentive staff, good service, fantastic food with a reasonable bill - all these superlatives describe the dining experience at Artemis at CapitaGreen. Rare gem in the restaurant scene in Singapore. There is also an adjoining outdoor bar where you can enjoy the view with a predinner drink. The drinks menu is an interesting collection and worth trying. The dinner area is quiet, posh and offers an excellent view of the beautiful Marina Bay Area. As the sun sets, the view is breathtaking. The food is excellent and there is an excellent wine list. Celebrated my partner's birthday and the staff prepared a little surprise. All in all an excellent experience. Will definitely be back

One of the better rooftop bars in Singapore recently. The service was great. They are attentive without being in the way. Great chillout music. Beautiful view. We saw glimpses of the sun setting on the nearby buildings (I was too busy munching and I didn't take the sunset photos). All the food we picked were delicious. The fried olives are my favourite. The cocktails we ordered all tasted good. Well balanced. Not too strong. We will definitely come back again

Located at 40th floor, the restaurant has good view and the seats are well located to enjoy the view together with delicious food. However, due to fantastic outside bar, the place is quite crowded hence if you are looking for quiet romantic dinner, I'd not recommend. Also, maybe personal taste but I felt the dishes were a bit salty. Apart from that, the food was very nice
5
Good drinks and produce tastes very fresh. Was very satisfied with our birthday dinner for a friend.
4
Very nice view. Restaurant was on a relatively high floor. Went there for lunch and was pretty noisy. Food was quite delicious. Rather enjoyed the alaskan crab salad and the fish. Servers were really attentive. Overall, pretty good. Other dishes we tried were just alright.
4
I went here for dinner with my company colleagues. The food was good and staff were nice and friendly. The rooftop bar was great and thought that it can be a standalone place. I recommend you have a drink or two there before having dinner.
5
Staffs were friendly, and food was good. Enjoyed every moment of the breath taking view, will go back again for more.
5
Starting with the location, this restaurant/bar is centrally located on the rooftop of CapitaGreen with sweeping views of the city. Service is excellent and food is amazing. Only gripe was the serving of burrata cheese was not large enough (too much other stuff and not enough cheese).
5
A comfortable restaurant with great views over the city and one well worth a visit. Service was faultless. The menu was very good and despite the simplicity all the dishes had a good flavour and balance. My sea bass with Spiced Rub, Broccoli and Crispy Leeks was a delight.A great lunch and just a shame I could not return for a Dinner.PS - try the cocktails
5
We had dinner here in the private dining room, and it was a very good experience from go to woe - a warm welcome from the friendly staff, a nice Australian IPA before dinner and then an excellent fixed menu. Pea soup, duck confit, tenderloin and pannacotta - nothing too exotic, but beautifully cooked and presented. A special mention in fact for the service, which really was top class.Impressive views from the 40th storey venue, and apparently a very cool roof bar too - I'll give that a try the next time I visit.Very highly recommended - a perfect evening
4
We ate the set lunch as the ala cart is quite expensive (starters and deserts for 20+ and mains 40+). In this context the two course set lunch at 48 was reasonable. The bread was excellent as was the starter of burrata and heirloom tomatoes. The grilled fish was average (12$ extra). Service was excellent. Overall good food and service but not great value.
5
Had a great meals here last night. Started off with a drink at their outdoor area(great view and helpful mixologist). Decided to have a glass of Cava instead in view of the hot weather. Moving indoor for dinner, Friendly staff and had their beef carpaccio and fig salads, for main- pork and vegetable tart and some sides. Interesting favours on the food and we truly had a great dinner enjoying the view and ambiance!
5
Impeccable service, inventive and delicious food, great cocktails, a table with a stunning view and wonderful attention to detail; these are what put the 'fine' in 'fine dining' and without a doubt, Artemis Grill has got these so right. From the moment we walked in, we were made to feel special as patrons. I had mentioned it was our wedding anniversary and requested a window table. Not only did we have this request fulfilled but also treated to a glass of champagne each on the house! The menu has a focus on seasonal and sustainable produce and the high quality of the ingredients was evident. Our server was very knowledgeable about the dishes and provided great recommendations. Our server (sorry, I can't remember his name!) and the sommelier Janice were an absolute delight and made our evening so special with their care and attention. Good service in a restaurant in rare in Singapore; great service paired with wonderful food is even rarer and the chefs and staff at Artemis definitely deserve all the praise for their work. Highly recommended for a special occasion
4
Having birthday celebration here. It is not fine dining however you could enjoy the view of Singapore's skyline. The bar outside is a great afterworks chill out place.
4
Nice view, beautiful. Ambience is great too. Food was pretty decent. Olive ice cream dessert is a must try! Be sure to order that.
4
The Starter is not good, but the main dish is fine. Got a few view in the high floor but still limited.
4
The food is pretty consistent with some interesting flavours. I think the service while friendly could be more focused.
5
Visiting Artemis was a great first time experience, nice, friendly and relaxed atmosphere with excellent choice of food and beverages.
5
Seeking a quality lunch of dinner for business or romantic purposes.....tick!!
Food and wine fantastic and whilst not cheap you get what you pay for and this was a result !
Enjoy. ))
4
Newly opened when we visited so the place was nicely decorated. We had a table by the window and the view was great. Good location and reasonably priced for the set lunches, perfect for business lunches.
5
Been here twice now. Perfect for a business lunch. Staff attentiveness is perfect and quality of food / speed of service well considered. 2 course lunch specials are worthwhile and good value. I will be back soon!
5
We managed to have dinner three times at Artemis before leaving Singapore.Service and food is TOP NOTCH.Excellent quality, great service, amazing produce, beautiful dish presentation and I haven't started talking about the menu.The bar outside is great for afterwork drinks or a romantic date. Great views of MBS bay area. The first time we visited we were not lucky enough to get a window table. It's a must, so book in advance.I normally don't write reviews over restaurants, but this place deserve one.We received an outstanding service, we were lucky to exchanged some words with the Chef. All our dishes were delicious, presentation was amazing, wine suggestion great and at the end we were treated with some fantastic desserts.Our only regret, not to have came back for a fourth meal before leaving Singapor
5
Definitely one of the best restaurants I've been to in Singapore, and I visited quite a few already. ARTEMIS is a certified winner in both food and restaurant view categories. Take one of the tables by the glass window and you can soak in the incredible view of the Marina Bay Sands, Arts & Science Museum, Gardens by the Bay, etc from the top - and that's because Artemis is located on the 40th floor of the new CapitaGreen tower. The interior is tastefully done which makes it a great place to meet for business meetings and/or romantic dates - especially at night when Singapore is blanketed by magnificent lights! And did I mention yet that the food is incredible? The taste, smell, texture and flirty flavours of the dishes that we tried from the appetisers, to mains and all the way down to dessert make for an incredible gastronomic adventure. The dessert was especially quirky. We ordered the chocolate praline with olive oil ice cream and mille feuille with blue cheese ice cream. In addition to the food and the awesome view, Artemis also scores very high when it comes to their staff. Those who assisted us were very friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant menu. A lot of restaurants fail in this, but not Artemis. Definitely coming back to try other specials. This restaurant is highly recommended
4
Great view from the restaurant and place is tastefully done up. We had set lunch which is rather average. No wow factor and rather over priced as compared to set lunch in the area.
4
The atmosphere and food of the restaurant was good and at a afforadble pricing. Will definitely visit the restaurant again
4
Good food, very good service. The Halibut ceviche was fantastic, however the carpaccio was average. I would go back again
5
Wonderfully elegant modern sky bar ( & restaurant ) on 40th floor.
Great staff at the bar (special mention to Azeem = the best cocktail artist & Rico the bar manager )
Wonderful view and great dj set !
5
Excellent food, great wine selection and amazing views! Looking forward to come back again very soon
4
A high quality high end lunch venue with great views of Singapore . Definitely very business at lunch but less so in the evening with a nice outside bar. Great fresh food intelligently presented and very exciting . My porky was delicious !! Get a table by the window ! Staff very friendly and efficient !!! Not light on your wallet but Singapore never is
5
Visited Artemis this evening with my wife and son. His choice, so not sure what to expect. The restaurant, food and service were all excellent. We started with a pre-dinner cocktail at the terrace bar. All three cocktails were delicious and well made. The views from the restaurant, on the fortieth floor, overlooking Marina Bay Sands, added to the experience.The food was of a very high standard, with all three of us choosing differing appetisers, mains and deserts. Each one of us was delighted with what we received. The service was attentive and could not be faulted.My son, who lives in Singapore, has now added this to his list of go to places and will definitely be back, as will we next time we visit.I highly recommend this restaurant
3
Food was so-so, could get better quality food elsewhere for the price. Could see that the restaurant was trying to portray itself as a fine dining restaurant but failed. Service staff seem to only follow protocol but insensitive to diner's needs and requests. Food took an hour to prep and serve. After we paid and was about to leave the restaurant, a server told us that we had complimentary dessert and asked if we will like it served outdoors or back at our table. We didn't even know that there was desserts to be served... And we asked for it to be served outside. The server (who was already holding onto a tray of dessert) somehow disappeared and did not show up with the said dessert after 10 minutes so we just left. Overall a very strange dining experience and probably not heading back in future.
5
Had dinner here with my cousin. Our server was extremely attentive and knowledgeable about the restaurants menu. Among the food we ordered, we especially enjoyed the France oysters, crab salad (not actually a salad bowl), and the tenderloin. Portions isn't too big so you may have to pay more for the extra dishes! Would visit again.
2
It was my first time and Artemis as it was recommended by a friend. I brought my bosses and colleagues which were 8 of us in total and the waiting hours was just too long! - 2 hrs and 30mins is unacceptable especially during lunch time. The only good review I can say is the peak view from the high floor and the food was just oka
4
Very nice atmosphere . My hubby like it a lot. Very beautiful view of the city. Will go back again!!
4
Our first visit to Artemis. Loveky view and good for romantic dates. Friendly service and exotic food.
4
The resturant staff were very friendly and helpful. It will be great if we took the window seats or the bar area. The atmosphere is good! Great experience!
5
It was our first visit and we were lucky to secure a window seat despite making reservation only an hour ago. The restaurant remained packed even at the later part of the night. Service was great initially but slipped a bit a the night got busier.We loved the breads and dukkah spices that came with it. Then we had two appetisers: alaskan crab salad and halibut crudo; three mains; organic corn fed chicken, Rhug Estate Salt Marsh Lamb and the Spicy Iberico Pork Presa; and two desserts: Pineapple Rhum Baba, and Apricot and Lavender Souffle. Food was delicious especially the refreshing salad and both desserts. The lamb was alsp tender with a crispy smokey skin though priced on a higher side. The Pork Presa was a bit tough but still tasty.The meal came up to SGD 300 plus, which was pricey but worth it for the night view and overall experience
5
Rooftop restaurant - they have a nice al fresco area so it's a good spot to hang outside before starting the evening and they also have happy hour drinks. Dinner inside was cool and we ate everything tapas style which meant we shared everything. Food was good including the dessert! Service staff were also willing to go the extra mile.
4
Artemis is a roof TOP restaurant with a magnificent view. All of us rave about the food and of course the reasonable wines. Every One enjoyed the occasion and instantly planning for a next visit. There are two things I would point out that could have made the experience even better 1) bad weather plan for the alfresco bar area. Everything went perfect until it start to rain and everyone had to move inside to continue the rest of the evening. 2) the service could be more attentive
3
Love the name of the restaurant and the location with great view of marina bay sands from the window.Food is decent, but not too value for a set lunch $45++ for 2 course +another $12 for tenderloin otherwise one will settle with chicken. Octopus salad is alright.Tenderloin had too much ligaments/tendon which made it not as tender and the outer seasoning was a little too salty. Has potential if the chef puts more effort in little details
5
An unexpected dinner here because the place we planned to go was full. The receptionist was very accommodating to take our last minute reservation.The staff and servers were very friendly and helpful, explaining the menu and recommendations. We ended up for a group of 5 ordering 3 appetizers (shrimps, halibut, crab salad), 3 mains to share (iberico pork, aged rib eye, duck), side dish (mushroom) and some desserts and coffee to finish. All were excellent and a had good variety of flavors. The seafood appetizers were refreshing. The grilled meats were done perfectly. The staff were super friendly. The views of MBS was awesome and coming in before 7pm, you can enjoy seeing it with day lights over happy hour drinks and then with night lights over dinner.Definitely worth a return
4
Went for dinner on a weekend so couldnt get the window side seats - would highly recommend getting those ideally by booking in advance. Had used Chope to make the reservation and being a first timer, didnt do my homework as well with regards to seats etc. Ambience is really nice, makes a great place for a date night or the likes - basically if and when in need to impress...Now to the food - being a vegetarian, options were limited to begin with and we almost tried everything that was on the menu. The salad was average (its a salad, not much that can be done there I guess), the potato fritters were good (easy), the cauliflower dish was sub par to a point that we didnt even eat it (the restaurant has a no takeaway policy for note - but the restaurant was kind enough to take the feedback on board and not charge us for it), the pasta was very good and the asparagus/beans dish was pretty good too. All in all, food was decent with the ambience being the cream on the top - oh and yes, how could I miss - the dessert was awesome - we had the Bombollini - simple and very well done. Their outdoor bar is pretty cool too - so when going for drinks, having a couple there before moving for dinner would be nice way to do it
4
Very nice food and ambience. The restaurant was very busy so the service was so so only. We ordered set lunch at $45) for 2 courses. For the food choice at this price, I would say it is on the high side for lunch. The set lunch also doesn't include coffee which is charged extra if you are ordering one
4
Generous portions for their set lunch. Good tasting organic food. Nice view of CBD and Marina Bay. Good service.
4
it has a romantic atmosphere. Nice view from the 40th floor. Music selection during dinner could be improved.
3
Ambience and views are amazing. My salmon was slightly salty although they did give us complimentry side dish.
5
All good things come with a price. Took my wife for her birthday celebrations. The venue was great, good food and nice service.
4
This app has a hundred character minimum which is an inconvenient way to say, excellent food at good prices.
5
Service was exceptional the cocktails are great very good value for money.We spent a wonderful night at Artemis and we will be happy to visit again.
5
I had an amazing time at Artemis. I've eaten at many rooftop restaurants in Singapore but this takes top place. The service was amazing, food was amazing and the view was the best part of everything. I enjoyed my night.
Will definitely be back.
5
I was introduced to Artemis by a good friend in April and have been back again twice in May. The whole experience is not to be missed. The food is the freshest available, organic and well prepared - the chef has a unique and light touch. The view is not to be missed - felt I'd been transported to New York City for the night plus the bar is outside on the balcony and also has sweeping views of the city.Staff are very attentive, know the menu and wine well, plus they are friendly and professional - all with a passion for hospitality and giving you an experience to remember. We've now tried a number of different dishes and the real standouts are the Rougie Duck Breast and Alaskan King Crab Salad - definite must tries. A big time favourite for us now
3
The menu seems like they may be able to put together some interesting vegetarian food, and we thought we would try it based on reviews we have read. Sad to say, despite a nice setting, good service, and a nice evening, the food really fell below par.
4
I had just landed in Singapore and my sister and brother in law picked me up at the airport. We drove directly to this lovely restaurant. The views are just amazing. The food and service were also excellent.The open air bar outside is worth a visit. Definitely one of the better restaurants in Singapore
5
Great food, great view. Trendy outdoor bar with sensational views toward Marina Bay Sands and beyond. Reccomend highly.
5
Had our company event for a luncheon and the food was awesome. The guest enjoy the ambience as well as the food. Food are special and tasteful. Worth a trip back again.
5
Where should I start with Artemis. Everything I ate there was absolutely delicious and I ate there at least at least 5 times. All business partners and friends that I brought in are all coming back with their friends / family. Location is great, the view is magnificent both during the day and night. The restaurant is spacious, giving enough room among tables to have privacy both on business lunch or with loved ones. Bar seems to attract a lot of crowd, they have some really tasty bar menu: charcuterie platter has Carrasco iberico ham which is by far the best Iberico ham I've ever tried.. It melts in your mouth - and who ever thought about frying olives and putting yoghurt and chili on them, such a crowd's pleasure! The biggest gem about this establishment is not even the bar but the experiences you get from dining in the restaurant.Olala the food.. I don't remember anything that is not good so I will just list down some of my favorites.APPETIZER:- Gambero rosso. Amazing how a clear tomato water packs so much flavour- Halibut crudo has three different intensities, the waiter gave us suggestion which one to eat first. I noticed that as I went from one to the other the flavor became stronger. It was interesting.- Grilled octopus hands down the best in town. This restaurant is not called Artemis Grill for nothing.- Duck confit salad, we asked the waiter where does the duck come from since it was so good. He said it's from France. I don't know whether it's the source of the product of simply the Chef's skill but we are from France and we have never eaten duck confit this good! I wish I could have it as take away for everyday lunch.MAINS:- My other top favorite is Iberico Presa. A must try, even my business partner from Spain said she had never eaten Presa prepared this way in her home country. It comes with spicy rub and padron pepper and relish tomato which is a nice touch for some sweetness.- Tenderloin grass fed, it's nice to have a break from wagyu everywhere!- Do ask for Toothfish (it's only on special) it's just heavenlyI could keep talking about so many dishes that bring so much pleasure to me and everyone I dined with. I love how they're not a stuck up place and not pretentious with the food presentation. We all have had enough of flowers, foam, smoke, dry ice gimmick or too pretty to eat but no flavour dishes.. Here is just simply real food, you can taste the love in the food. I am not a big drinker but on few occasions I asked the Sommelier's recommendation to pair my food with, it was spot on. Service was always friendly. Good job Chef and Team! We'll see you again.. tonight in fact
3
Artemis for its location and styling sadly does not live up to expectations, I had lunch there recently and while the starter was good my main course of lamb was average, very expensive and while the view is impressive you are literally paying for it. I also find it strange in a restaurant in this price range that they don't have their own bathroom and you need to walk outside to use the facilities
4
Had a wonderful lunch with a client this week and he's suitably impressed by the food quality, and the ambience. We ordered the set lunch and the entree was octopus which was delicious and generously proportioned. The black olive calamatta from North Africa is unique and love that it looks like dirt after dipping in with olive oil. The black angus beef was cooked to perfection and paired with the delicate puree. I felt my salad was okay, not terribly fancy but tasty nonetheless. My main course was the fish dish and the spicy powder on its crispy skin made it quite an interesting texture. I'll definitely return for the Alaskan crab salad which I didn't get to sample yesterday
5
Artemis is a new restaurant located on the 24th floor of Capita Green. The service, decor, views and most importantly the food were great.I had Alaskan crab with papaya salad as a starter which was presented with flair and was simply delicious. It was followed by Welsh lamb which had been interestingly spiced.Whilst the whole restaurant has nice views ask for a table by the window for commanding views across Marina Bay.The only criticism I had was that tables are a bit cramped and near each other so you don't get much privacy
4
About 2 weeks back I was invited to have lunch with my 3 other male clients in Artemis and it was my first time visiting, I was welcomed by a very beautiful lady of an alluring face and not forgetting curves - for a moment I was mesmerized as though I am the opposite gender! As soon as she learn my name she walked me in to my table where my clients were already awaiting, I was taken aback by the view of the restaurant as I walk in but I wasn't left to dazed and be in my own bubble, she initiated a quick yet heartwarming chats along the way with much grace and I quickly feel comfortable. I am impressed with her swiftness and am very pleased that I am not just another customer at lunch as I happened to hear her walking other people to nearby tables with a different conversations, as she passes by she checks on my table with all smiles.Order taking was a breeze, food came quick and it was good, waiters were proactive and attentive. I had a glance and spotted some pretty good vintages in their wine list which I look forward in my next visit. The bill though took longer than usual but in all we were pleased with the quality of service rendered, all compliments to Imelda for her genuine and sincere service orientation - a warm welcome like no other for a restaurant with a view and beyond
4
I work in this building and took a colleague from London there, despite never actually having been there myself. Situated on the 40th floor of the modern CapitaGreen building in Market Street, it's an impressive venue. We walked in to be escorted to a window table with 40 floor views of the sunsetting over the Singapore Strait and the stunning Marina Bays Sands hotel floating in the foreground. It took a minute for me to stop staring and remember I wasn't alone. The food is inventive, tasty and creatively presented. The service is excellent and the wine selection well rounded. It's expensive but you pay for what you get and the view alone is worth half the bill.Definitely an impressive booking for business or pleasure.
4
Choice of 2 course @$45 or 3 course @50StarterStuffed Octopus - Nice but a little too saltyDuck Confit (+$8) was done to perfect, the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. Main course Corn fed spring chicken breast with cous cous - lovely and tender chick, tastyVegetable Tart - freshly baked, light and deliciousAged chargrill tenderloin (+12) medium done DessertPanna cottapineapple baba with rum & raisin ice cream, cheese platter ($+10)Starter was served promptly, took a bit of waiting on the main course and also on the dessertA complimentary dessert came as it was my brother's birthday, even though it came later after we have finish our dessert & coffee. However, was a nice personal touch
5
We enjoyed a fantastic evening at Artemis on Saturday night. Lovely ambience, great views, attentive and friendly service, and delicious fresh cuisine. Many thanks again to the excellent team at Artemis - we will be sure to pass on our very positive verdict and recommendation to colleagues, friends and family. And it will be one of our first choices for taking visitors to Singapore! C&R
4
New restaurant in heart of business district, great place for pre dinner drinks and amazing views onto MBS. Special occasion or visitor to Singapore
5
The view and Octopus starter are both excellent - highly recommended a visit to this new restaurant.
Also enjoyed the Saddle of Lamb!
5
Went there for pre-dinner drinks and dinner with friends. The outdoor bar area is a great place to meet up for drinks, lovely ambience.
The staff were courteous and knowledgable...the food was divine!!
Highly recommend Artemis if you are in Singapore.
5
I had lunch at Artemis. We had some amazing starters, Octopus, Duck and some amazing asparagus with an orange dressing and roasted Hazelnut. Main were excellent too. Had the Panacotta and another Banana dessert that were both delicious. Service was great and served us faster as we only had an hour break
4
If you are looking for a venue for a great evening out this is the one. Start out at the bar with a drink and some great views of Singapore. Move inside for an excellent meal, will great service and a good wine list to go with it, keeping with the view. End outside at the bar with a coffee or that last drink. You will not be disappointed in any of the above. Highly recommended. Enjoy
4
Decent food, nice view, good value.Pleasantly surprised by this establishment. New place I believe on top of a newish tower in the CBD. Not the best view in town since its still clustered in by surrounding buildings, but from the 40th, you still have a pretty good panorama, and view of the Marina Bay. Could see the fireworks display that were going off over at the waterfront.The decor is well done, and the lighting just the right balance of warmth.The main takeaway, was the pricing. I didnt expect mains to be priced so reasonably (for skydining). And the food was good, better than their more famous competition, which really is just a skybar with attached kitchen. And I didnt have to order 2 mains, as the portions were ok. (We've all been to other places where they try to keep the pricing within an acceptable cut throat price by serving small portions.)You get to enjoy decent food here with your view, which i am sad to say isn't the case with other non-specialty skydining places so far in singapore.The seafood was fresh, and grilled to perfection. On par with the other seafood speciality place I reviewed before, but here, cheaper. Lamb i thought was well flavoured, and balanced perfectly with yoghurt cutting thru. But my date thought it was too salty. Oh the duck confit salad! Quality confit, rendered fat, crisp skin, tender meat. Ever since the good french bistro at robertson disappeared, its been hard to find good duck confit in Singapore. i hope they introduce it as a main.Competent dessert
5
If you are looking for somewhere in Singapore with views to have an elegant, yet leisurely dining experience, then look no further. The views from the 40th floor at night are spectacular. The menu offers a good array of interesting starters, delicious meat and veg mains and a fewl delectable desserts. Unfortunately it was raining on the night we went to Artemis so we didn't get the opportunity for a drink first at the rooftop outdoor bar so we will just have to go back. I took a sneak at the side of the dining room and there seems to be two rooms with views for large groups to celebrate as well
5
Dined here last night for the second time and had a great evening. The food here is excellent, all four of us had different mains and they were all beautifully cooked and presented. What really makes this place is the service. The staff are really friendly and make you feel very welcome. The outside bar area and cocktails are good too. The prices for dinner are what you would expect for a place like this in the cbd, but ok for a special occasion. Drinks wise are average price and maybe even a bit cheaper than similar places. Will be back again soo
5
With its dedicated express elevator to the 40th floor, you reach the entrance swiftly and are met with breathtaking views of Singapore. The decor is contemporary but nothing special. The menu was limited. I struggled to make a selection but once I had, enjoyed my meal of cold pea soup followed by steak. The service was first class from a very attentive team of waiters.
5
The food is delicious: ranging from seafood, meats, salads, and vegetarian dishes. Decadent but healthy too which I like. I keep going back for lunch and dinner, and pre-dinner drinks at its outside bar. Happy hour has great deals from 5-8pm, well worth popping in for a pre-dinner drink. Both the bar and restaurant are on the rooftop (40th floor) of the CapitaGreen building (downtown) and look on to the skyline and ocean. I think the set lunch is great value for the quality of food, $45/50 for 2/3 courses Monday-Friday. The dinner is pricier but worth it. My favourites on the menu are the confit duck fig salad, Alaska lobster, Iberia pork, rum and raisin ice cream pineapple cannoli, and lavender soufflÃ©. All the food I've tried is yummy. I've enjoyed good wines, beers and cocktails here too.
5
An amazing venue for a great business lunch or a private dinner for two - both with an amazing view.
Check out the private dining rooms for something really special.
4
Its an great place at singapore CBD area with an good out door bar ! Must try the fried olives and spicy prawn @bar
nice crab salad ,spicy pork and mushroom pie
love the view
5
I almost don't want to review this as it was such a pleasure to enjoy I want to keep it all to myself! Wonderfully located at CapitaGreen with stunning views over Marina Bay this is a magical place.Restaurant and bar are all spaciously designed, set lunch is extremely tasty as are dinner options. The wine sommelier whom I have known at DB Modern and Tamarind Hall provides excellent choices.Service is with a smile and I couldn't fault anything here, stunning experience every time I go! Keep it up
4
We had dinner here on a stormy night so the beautiful views of Marina Bay Sands and the financial district were obscured. Nevertheless it was a great find. Service was good, especially from the sommelier, tables were spread out, and it was a classy restaurant. Our appetizers of halibut crudo and grilled Spanish octopus were divine. The tenderloin steak at medium rare was also one of the best steaks I had in Singapore. Roasted pumpkin salad, bread and desserts (souffle) were also good. Prices were on the high side as in these kind of places in Singapore, but the French champagne and Italian red wine was really expensive at S$150 and S$98 respectively, although they were good. This inflated our bill to more than S$200 per person; without the drinks it would have been about S$100. I would have rated this restaurant 5 stars if not for the expensive drinks. Still, I plan to return.
5
The view is spectacular, the service is amazing and the food is awesome-some of the best food that I've had in Singapore. I am not a gluten-free or vegetarian person, but for those who are, they will be happy. Portions are not huge, except for the crushed potato wedges-which are FAN-tastic. The beef tenderloin is oh so tender. The king crab salad is so fresh and tasty. The cauliflower side dish is possibly my favourite. I could go on-am working my way through the menu. I've also used their private dining room for an event and it was very good too. I can't say enough-their outdoor bar with the huge fans is also a great place to hang with friends
4
I had lunch here today with a friend. The views over the city and anchorage are good and the set lunch seemed good value at $45 for two courses. But of course, we had the risotto and on shared asparagus asparagus on the side and we drank sparkling water and had a coffee and suddenly $45 had become $100, exactly what the other reviewer found. I couldn't fault the food though. Duck confit with figs to open, very tasty with the flesh perfectly tender, and a large portion. Then the saffron seafood risotto was as a modest sized main. The bread was fresh and crisp (and came included in the set lunch). The asparagus was mixed with beans and roasted hazelnuts and orange. Tasted great - thick spears seared nicely. The pieces of orange gave it a good citrus flavour to balance the oil, but I would have preferred no beans and more asparagus - if I want french beans I will order them myself

I had a bad experience the first time I came and I was invited again for a business lunch. They do have decent price lunch but only if you choose the item with no add-on. If you want fish or meat in your lunch menu you have to pay extras. So our $45 lunch quick becomes a $100 lunch with all extras, water and coffee. Beter to come here only for a drink and the view

For a new restaurant, Artemis Grill has flown under my radar until I discovered it on Facebook. Having business to conduct in the area was great incentive to pop by afterwards for a leisurely lunch. The restaurant is located on the 40th floor of Capital Green in the CBD. There is also a rooftop bar whose focal point is a 100 year old olive tree. But I digress. I discover the Chef Fernando Arevalo was formerly from Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse whose food I had previously enjoyed. This new setting gives him more scope to expand his culinary offerings beyond steaks to vegetables & seafood. The style is primarily Mediterranean & from my meal here pretty wonderful. For a restaurant this new, word certainly gets out as there was a healthy lunch crowd of business people on expense accounts. I had the Gambero Rosso for a starter. This is essentially a sweet red prawn which came a melange of mirepoix vegetables & served with tomato water, which lent the dish a clean, distinctive taste. I enjoyed this dish a lot. I followed up with a plate of San Danielle prosciutto and cantaloupe. A nice touch was the slices of chargrilled country bread that came with it. Simple ingredients at their peak that tasted just sensational. I ordered an appetizer portion of Beetroot Tortellini as my main. The pasta was cooked al dente as it should & was served on a bed of carrot puree & grilled asparagus & broccolini. It was delicious without being cloying. I opted for just one type of cheese, Robiola Roccaverano instead of dessert. The creamy sheep's milk cheese came with an assortment of dried & fresh fruits as well as a fruit compote & crispy toast wafers. Artemis Grill was certainly a great discovery & I will certainly be returning for more delicious food. I have to mention that the service teamclicked well together to provide competent & professional service. Thumbs up to them as they made the meal a memorable experience.

Lunch with a group of clients. Portions were pretty generous. I had the beef tartare as a starter and I enjoyed it tremendously. The salmon I had as my main was also enjoyable. The selection of breads was also good. Service was good and the view excellent. Wasn't cheap but all in great place for a business lunch. Definitely be here again
