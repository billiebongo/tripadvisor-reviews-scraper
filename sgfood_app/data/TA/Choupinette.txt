Had brunch here and a coffee. Not exactly the cheapest place (set brunch menu 25++) and bread, home made gravalax sauce was good. Otherwise pretty average, in particular at this price point.

We did groceries at the German Market-and found this beautiful place. Amazing croissants, tasty cappuccino, nice team, cozy atmosphere. You should give it a try!
Breakfast looks good too!

Very cute, small and intimate restaurant. Surrounded by freshly baked breads and cakes. The eggs Benedict were the best I have eaten in Singapore.

I like good bread. Hey, I've even written and broadcast about bread. It's just one of those simple things that deserves to be done well. I have to say that the sourdough I paid SG$7.80 for was disappointing - more like a fluffy white than a real sourdough with bite, taste and texture. Not worth the money..
2
Bad value for food you get. The fruit juice that came with the breakfast set tasted like packaged juice (artificial tasting). The baguette was very average (disappointing given that the place is supposed to be French) and the butter was tasteless. A better quality butter would have made a difference. Coffee + 1/2 baguette + butter/jam for $14 is just way overpriced
5
Excellent cakes and a great menu, really nice and cozy place to relax and have dinner or lunch. It's right beside a German Marketplace, which I also discovered while in Singapore. The interior is a mix of Ikea shelves and Monin Fruit syrups with various tastes, of which I found Bubble Gum the most awkward one, but there seems to be tasters for such. Little France amongst India and Chinatown, very much worth a visit

We went for brunch on a Sunday after reading reviews on this site. Not sure if we caught them on a bad day, but the food was mediocre, at best. We paid around SGD80 in total. Husband had poached egg/salmon set that came with a hot drink and juice while I had the beef stew and a soft drink. At this price point, it's easy to find a much tastier alternative with much higher-quality ingredients

Delicious and flaky croissants. I believe Choupinette is one of the first few cafes having delicious croissants. Since then there are many cafes serving their own style of croissants. My suggestion is for you to try Choupinette's and compare. You will not be disappointed. Good range of breakfast items. Service is happy and friendly which will make me go back again. Lunch/dinner menu offers wide choice but have not tried

The reviews are true - some of the best eggs in Singapore! The hollandaise sauce was very well made too - light and lightly tart - didn't overpower the prrfectly cooked eggs. Plus very tasty, delicately smokey ham. Make sure you try to save room for the pastries or bread! Great bread is hard to come by in Singapore but Choupinette has a wide selection and the brioche is perfectly buttery...the croissants are excellent too. A great spot for brunch (all day!), lunch or dinner and a short stroll from Tan Kah Kee mrt

This quaint cafe has withstand a slew of competition over the years as more F&B outlets pop up around the area in recent times. Nonetheless, it retains its homely charm and well-executed egg dishes. This spot is probably one of my top spots for Eggs Ben. The hollandaise sauce is well-balanced and the ham is cooked to perfection, exuding a salty and savoury taste onto the muffin. Needless to say, the egg was runny and it pop with a slight poke. I am glad this cafe retained its standards over the years and would love to be back

Went for eggs benedict and was not disappointed. Great service, great food, good coffee, nice atmosphere.

The title says it all, all is good and served well, but if you look too the bill you can eat at marina bay, 76$ for a simple lunch...

We love the eggs benedict and eggs royale! The portion is just right and the set comes with choice of juice AND choice of coffee/tea/hot chocolate. Perfect for lazy sunday mornings when you don't need something adventurous! This place wouldn't go wrong / disappoint! Btw, their bakery selection is fabulous too

We had breakfast here. We reached slightly around 830am and it was crowded. The cafe has a streaming crowd with a mixture of locals and foreigners. The cafe has both indoor and outdoor seats. It is not a big cafe.The menu serves all day breakfast, brunch and lunch all day. The food and pastries tasted decent.The speed in which food was served was acceptable considering that it was crowded
5
Drop into Choupinette for a great brunch option that won't break the bank, but beware that it only seats about 30 pax and gets busy on the weekend. The eggs Benny are a great option, particularly in a "set" with a coffee and juice. And the pastries are a typically French indulgence.
4
Have been twice: both times the Eggs Royale set (Eggs Benedict, toast and smoked salmon, fresh juice, drink (coffee). Food is really excellent: coffee not so good (coffee is good flavour, but they cannot seem to make a flat white). Price at S$26 (there may be tax on top) is a few dollars high. Very few tables, but both times got in no wait. Service was fine. Enjoyable: would and will go agai

This pseudo French cafe is seriously overrated considering that there are a lot more worthier cafes that have come up on the radar in the recent years, offering way better food and service at a lower prices. The limited tables and long wait aside, their service attitude is cold, bothering on rude simply because they think that they are too popular to give a damn. It will not stay on its high horse for long

My family of 4 went for brunch one Saturday. Get there early - the place fills up and it's tiny! The food was great - really well executed eggs benedict. My biggest disappointment was that the juices are clearly from a box - I mean, I think they go next door to the Fair Price...with so much fresh fruit in Singapore - and so cheap, it's sad they aren't fresh-squeezed - especially since they cost $6.50 a glass... I was also surprised they didn't know what a cafe au lait was. I settled for coffee with cream - and then it wasn't even cream, but milk. In a French restaurant? Service was fine - I think it's hard on them because the place is so small and they try for quick turnarounds, especially when busy. They do have limited outdoor seating as well

A cool, warm & personalised welcome by Miss Agnes the lady boss. Excellent fresh & natural ingredients selection. An extra terrestrial Nicoise Salad and outstanding Eggs Benedict. The choice of the bread makes all the difference. Excellent choices of Rose wines and Pinot. Go, enjoy & chat with Miss Agnes

I've never had such rank bad service in my life, and the food was quite frankly horrible.The place advertised eggs Benedict as the main specialty for Brunch, but considering that it was 1:30 pm it wasn't what I fancied so I ordered a burger and a glass of water, my friend orders a soup and sandwich and a cup of tea.1. The waiter says there are no seats, we'll have to wait so we say yes. ( There were two empty tables which needed cleaning)2. he then says " this WILL be your table, like we have no say in the matter anymore. The unfriendliness in the tone of voice is unmistakable.3.The cup of tea arrives after 15 minutes, first an empty tea cup, which we stare at for a while before the tea pot arrives.4. No water yet.5. A couple now sits in the table next to ours, they arrive ten minutes later. They order eggs Benedict, get their meal in five minutes.6. its now 20 minutes, and the couple next door have almost finished their meal, no soup, no sandwich and no burger and no water yet.7. The waitress comes over says sorry, and wants to know how I'd like my burger cooked lol. I say rare8. then after 30 minutes of waiting everything appears, the burger is so rarely cooked that its almost cold.the salad consists of four rockets and 2 slices of tomato and some fries dumped next to it.The sandwich is fair price ham toasted on bread with some cheese. there were two small dead insects in the salad and still no water.9. this whole thing cost 63$. A complete debacle, I'm not sure if i was at fault here for ordering something that was not a popular choice on the menu item. Even if i did, the waitress could have suggested that it would take a long time to cook. A place I'd never go back to again. whats more trip advisor and the yelp and hungrygowhere are raving about this place, my experience was quite opposite I must say

What to Eat :
Le Eggs Benedict (Bacon/Ham) and Le Eggs Royale(salmon) - NICE!!!
Loved the how the poached eggs matched with the hollandaise sauce.
2
Super lousy service. The staffs ignored customer. Hot choco drink was not hot. Food was too oily. The staffs attitude very bad.
4
A lovely French patisserie along Bukit Timah serving consistently good breakfast, brunch, lunch items with a French flair. Service is excellent; food quality is good. Baked goods available daily. Coffee served up strong like French coffee should be. Try the pain chocolate!

The three of us plus my two year old grand daughter went here for brunch on Sunday as the restaurant was rapidly filling with customers.This is an exquisite place with the most delicious food, it would be a huge success anywhere and I expect they do as well with customers just buying their breads and pastries as they obviously do with those dining.The eggs benedict and eggs Florentine were amazing and the hamburgers I checked out on the adjacent table looked very tasty also!The staff were charming and helpful and my grand daughter demolished an amazing looking chocolate praline chou chou....or something like that
5
I was here specifically for the eggs Benedict after repeatedly hearing rave reviews and they certainly did not disappoint. The eggs were beautifully poached and tasted fabulous with the ham and crusty toasts they sat on. Rather pricey at SGD25 but the brunch set includes a glass of fruit juice plus a cup of hot coffee or tea, both of your choice. There was just one server both manning the restaurant and serving its customers during my visit but being an early weekday morning, this posed no issues with the service rendered. Pleasant and prompt, along with delicious poached eggs and a smooth latte in a tight but cosy setting, I enjoyed the whole dine-in experience thoroughly. There is both indoor and outdoor seating although outdoor ones are limited to just a couple tables. I can see a long wait for a table during peak periods. Baby high chairs are available. If you drive, coupon-based public parking around the area is available but limited so be prepared to wait

My girlfriend and I love both the Eggs Benedict and the Eggs Royale! Just that the set seems kinda odd as it comes with both fruit juice and hot drink bcus i wouldn't wanna mix fruit juice with coffee/tea. Other than that, everything seems great! the washroom's location is a bit out of place though. shld have been inside the cafe rather than outside

A French place close to the botanical gardens serving a variety of food. It seems like one of those places frequented by local regulars who go there for a chilled weekend brunch. There were a couple of families there too, so the place is definitely child friendly. It is a short walk from the botanical gardens so good to visit either before or after the walk, depending on how hungry you are (and whether you work up your appetite while walking, or want to walk off what you ate!).We went for brunch, however, coming from Australia for me it was lunchtime as I had not yet adapted to the different time zone, so I was able to have lunch, while my local friends had brunch. This was good, as many places usually serve only bruch or only lunch. Of the food I tried, bread was fresh and excellent, and the lasagne I had was also very enjoyable. The portions are not too big and not too small. In all had a great time and would be happy to go back

Had a tiring walk in the Botanic Gardens and I decided to have coffee in Choupinette in Bukit Timah. They are very well known for Eggs Benedict. However, I tried just a like snack and I tried their Almond Danish with coffee and it was superb!! Excellent service by Rob Lo

I had brunch at Choupinette on a Sunday morning. Luckily I arrived early as there are limited seats and the place fills up very quickly. I ordered the Eggs Royale set (eggs benedict with toast and smoked salmon) which comes with a juice (orange juice) and a hot drink (hot chocolate). My friend ordered the Chou Chou set (choice of a main, a hot drink and a dessert) and she decided to have the croque-monsieur, coffee and 4 macaron. I enjoyed the eggs benedict a lot but the rest of the items were so-so.The hot chocolate had more milk than chocolate. All the macaron had the same chocolate filling and ... The additional strawberry tart ($7.2 for a tart!) that I ordered was pretty disappointing.The service staff at the cafe came across as cold and reserved. I don't think I'm likely to return again as I feel I can get better brunch and friendlier service elsewhere

Being a rather popular place, we decided only to go on weekend early mornings when it had just opened (around 8am). The place looks very much like a cosy European cafe. Seats are quite limited, and they only allow reservations for bigger groups. The eggs benedict are definitely one of the best I have ever had! The eggs royale were good too (smoked salmon) but I would still pick the eggs ben over it. Their selection of bread was also quite wide.The downside is that this place is expensive. Although the eggs ben comes with coffee, at $22, it is still rather steep and would prevent me from visiting more frequently. Same goes for their breads
5
We usually go there, when we want to have a nice European breakfast. There is one table outside, which can accommodate 6 and where you can bring your dogs along. They will even bring them water.

Simple meals. Great bakery. We had breakfast but I can see a carafe of red wine, some cheese, pate and a baguette in our future. Friendly staff, cheap, cheerful and family oriented.

Had breakfast.
The food was fine.
The price was however too much for the type of food being served.
Will not be back.

2 words. expensive breakfast. i had the eggs benedict. good. but a really big chunk of my wallet.

Great little french neighbourhood bakery and breakfast/lunch place....

Interesting ambience. Love the pasteries and the baby maccaroons

Went to Choupinette last Sunday for breakfast with some friends, was lucky to get a parking space right outside, but we had to wait about 20 mins for a table. I ordered the Croque Madame and it was done very nicely. Wife had the croissant, it was even better than the famed Tiong Bahru ones. Highly recommended
4
I had the Salad Nicoise which was fairly good although there was too much canned tuna on it. Considering the rest of the ingredients were so fresh and lovely, it seemed a shame to spoil it with a huge blob of canned tuna. The service was OK, but not very friendly and prone to mistakes. They did let us sit for several hours and talk, which was appreciated in mostly "rush you in and out" Singapore. The toilet is accessible OUTSIDE although attached to the kitchen. Very odd set up

I really dont want to come across as rude but a lot of reviews here are stating that they spent too much money for their meal... my question is... Do you read the prices on the menu before you order? Why order a $20+ salad to then say its too expensive?We had a plate of eggs benedict which came with 2 eggs benedict whereas in most other brunch places you get 1 egg for a similar price.Anyways money aside.. The food is very good at choupinette the pain au chocolat tastes exactly like it just came out of a boulangerie in France.During the weekend it tends to be crowded but within 5/10 min of wait you get a nice cozy seat inside. Service OK

Probably the most expensive salad i have ever had. Small portion, one boiled egg cut in 4, 3 small cherry tomatoes and thats it, they charge you 26 sgd. I dont even talk about the dressing of the salad. My friend had the poched egg...same price 25 sgd, I didnt know they used golden eggs haha.Besides the below average food and the choking price, the ambiance is nice and the service fast and friendly
