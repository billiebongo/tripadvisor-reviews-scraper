If I craving for local Malay foods, I always went to this restaurant. Variety of choices & foods are deliciousðŸ˜‹

We ate gulai ayam and rice, it is very yummy. The interior of the restaurant is interesting, the red color dominate the interior. During our stayed in Singapore, we never missed our dinner here.

It was not a very fantastic nasi padang, So So only but pricey. They have a lot of variety with some malay kueh kueh too.

The once mighty warung m.nasir has now dropped to the level of an average food court nasi padang stall. Just pricierOnce they had a love for the food but now it seems that that love affair is gone.Not sure who does the cooking now.The sambal goreng is average. so is the bergedil and a few others.Their much celebrated rendang has now been cut into even smaller pieces than before. And boy are they rock hard. Akin to beef jerky.a few saving graces. chicken rendang. their braised lung. and also fried chicken good.however this is then marred by their stinginess in the sambal they will give you.makes you feel bad to ask for more

This restaurant is located at Killiney Road. The food serve here are of malay /indonesian cuisine. Good ,tasty and superd food with alot of varieties. It may be pricey for some but from my opinion i dont mind the price because of the NICE FOOD. besides the variety dishes, i love the malay traditional kuih, lopes. The ' teh tarik' is AWESOME

Singaporeans know that it is really difficult to find good rendang in Singapore. But I believe I've found it! The chicken rendang and the beef rendang are dishes not to be missed! Expensive by local standards, but if you are Peranakan, Malay or Indonesian, and have tried their food, you know it is worth every cent! Furthermore, if you love jazz, you will enjoy dining here

Very nice Nasi Padag food. I always go for the chicken rendang, some veggies, bean curd and fried eggs (see picture). I probably have dinner here once a week and never disappointed. Yes I live close by, but I also live close to domino pizza which I never have visited :

Dined with family and we ordered fried chicken, sayur lodge, sambal goreng, ikan bilis and salted egg. The price for per piece chicken is $5 and it was miserably small. We were more than happy to pay but the overall taste was below standard of any warong place selling nasi Padang. There is no return for us here, and the price isn't justified for a plain cup of hot water is 50cents. We believe to pay for it but the charges is totally unacceptable. I don't recommend this place unless you don't mind paying for hefty price with unplatable saltish food

The restaurant sits about 20-30. It is a bit cramped, but so are all the other restaurants along this stretch. The decor is nice. The air-well is really nice.The food is good. The portions were just OK, not generous. The peanuts was a single spoonful. I ordered chicken redang, peanuts and a veggie dish. I added a can of Coca Cola. It was SGD8+. Now this might seem affordable so near Orchard Road, but I did note that nearby stores were having lunch offers for full set lunches for the same price. Dominos next door was offering a pizza and a drink for SGD5. So, I think it is not very good price for the area

Firstly, I really like the decor of this place. It also plays the best music in any bar or eating house in Sg. This is where I come when I want to spend about 7USD and have a pleasant and healthy meal.A good selection in authentic style. I will be eating there again tomorrow

Tasty, authentic cuisine. A tad pricey but the prime location (town area) explains it.
The beef rendang is a must try.

Amazing Nasi Padang selection with very tasty home-made selection of dishes. The owner adds a personal touch and explains the various dishes to each of the guests.

This is a casual Indonesian place on a quaint street. Beef Rendang is the superstar along with the sambal fried boiled egg. Best I have had.

This used to have an authentic taste but now, all there is to it is just salt. Ordered the assam pedas, sayur lodeh and sambal bean with firm tofu. Except for the textures and colours, there is no distinction in taste and they all tasted salty. Assam pedas is supoosed to have a bit of a tang and sayur lodeh is supposed to be rich in taste with strong coconut flavour, all these were missing. Hopefully, they can bring back the taste of the good old days, otherwise, would not recommend this at all!!

@TheKuoKnowsSecreted away on Killiney Road, which is an offshoot of Orchard Road, sits Warung M. Nasir.For those with long memories, Warung M. Nasir is a nostalgic trip to a time when many Singapore restaurants looked a lot like this - unfussy and unpretentious.Warung M. Nasir serves excellent Nasi Padang or rice with side dishes. It does so with such simplicity and efficiency that it is little wonder the restaurant is packed to the rafters at lunchtimes.It even provides some 60s and 70s piped music to accompany your meal. During my visit, Jose Feliciano's "Light My Fire" could be heard on the speakers, which seemed a little unnecessary, since my throat was already on fire.Warung M. Nasir spolis its customers with far too much choice. But better to have too much than too little. The Chicken Curry was superbly hot. As was the Beef Rendang. The Beans and Tahu cubes and Achar Pickles were equally delightful. But I particularly enjoyed the Roasted Peanuts and Anchovies, which added some welcome crunch to an otherwise faultless meal.Warung M. Nasir is a little pricier than your run-of-the-mill Nasi Padang outlet. But that, I guess, is the price to pay for being in the Orchard Road area

This place is right smack in town with a rustique ambience and offering great n very affordable nasi padang. Such a 'breath of fresh air' from the ones in the foodcourts along Orchard Rd, not only for the location and be able to not sit in airconditioning areas but also for their very good food with reasonable pricing in town.Already one of my fave places and will definitely be back on regular basis. Do take note that you don't come too late for lunch or dinner or you will be left literally with left-overs. But the very good point is, that they cook a totally fresh batch around 4 PM... Love itt

If you have read my earlier review on another restaurant serving nasi pasang, Warun M Nasir beats that one hands down. My family and I have come here many times to satisfy our craving for authentic indonesian nasi padang. While it's a humble eatery, what you get is good quality and value for money. And their sambal cili packs a punch too! Well done guys.. keep up the good quality

My wife and I had dinner here on Monday 2nd November 2015 on our Singapore trip. Our order comprised of two plates of rice with beef rendang, chicken rendang, fried kangkung (water spinach) and sayur lodeh (vegetable curry). Both rendang dishes were hot and spicy, very flavoursome and lived up to our expectations. The kangkung and lodeh were milder dishes to complement the fiery rendang. The meal was uniquely Indonesian and very enjoyable. Our drinks were glasses of freshly squeezed lime juice - just perfect for our tastebuds.We chose to sit at a table near the back of the restaurant which seemed quieter and dimly lit. The cool draught from the air-conditioner was a blessing. The background music was very tasteful classical music to enhance the mood. The walls were decorated with pictures of movie stars and singers. The decor on the shelves were old musical instruments and woven baskets. The manager was courteous, friendly and very obliging. Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience

I live around the area, and this is my go to place for nasi padang. Good value here - rice with three dishes (two veg + 1 meat) usually cost me around 7 SGD. The teh tarik is also quite decent and cheap.As mentioned by everyone, the beef rendang here is great. Also, if you manage to come in early in the morning, the fried chicken is quite good too when it is relatively fresh. Sometimes when I feel like it, I also get the tahu telor which is which quite decent. It's primarily tofu instead of fried egg, which I like very much. A lot of the tahu telors in these places are often greasy fried eggs with little bits of tofu, which annoys me quite a bit.Service is friendly and unpretentious, ideal for a local eating spot

What a great spot for a Sunday brunch. There is a variety of Padang food on offer here, all looks delicious and very fresh. Friendly people serving. I usually take the beef rending which has always been lean, soft, spicy and delicious. With rice and vegetables its makes for a great early lunch. Sitting on the street watching the people of Killiney Road go by, it's a good spot and worth a visit
