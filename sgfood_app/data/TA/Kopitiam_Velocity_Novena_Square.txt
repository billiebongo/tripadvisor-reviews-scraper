Good value at the Novena Square good court. The roasted duck noodles was good. Lots of shopping and eateries around. Also a fitness Centre.

I tried the Japanese cuisine and it was worth every penny. Teriyaki chicken set and Salmon fish set is worth a try.

As a local comparing the average food court standard excluding Food Republic (a higher end food courting Singapore), Kopitiam - Velocity @ Novena Square has good value stalls. I tried the fish soup stall, Thai stall and the Wanton noodle stall in 1 visit. The quality of the fish is really fresh and provides a good reasonable for the price paid. Being not a fish lover myself, I will go for the fish soup @ S$4.50 again. Singaporeans normally prefer the dry wanton noodle with chilli of course. A soup base wanton noodle will tells one the depth and skills of stall. Their wantons are huge almost the size of a baby fist. You must finish a whole wanton to judge if you like it. 4 wantons in a bowl of noodle with a plain simple soup @ S$4.50. I must say the soup base is above average of normal stall. Not too salty. Worth a try and really value for money. One can choose to add additional char siew or other meats from the same stall. Had a Mango mixed Papaya Thai salad @S$5.00. Not too bad. Note is Salad not Som Tam. They just pour the premix sauce in a plate of ingredients and diner mixed it. Overall, is a really good place when you need a place for treat your hunger individually or solo

There are a few food court at this area. Kopitiam at novena square serve average food compare with other food court. Tried the Philippines food(quite expensive for me), Thai and Chinese. Not my first choice for lunch place but once a while I will be here

Kopitiam while being individual stores are always such similar quality and cost. Singapore hawker style dining available just about 24 hours a day.We stopped here a couple of mornings for our breakfast and cannot recommend it enough. This is a small Kopitiam but still had what we wanted
