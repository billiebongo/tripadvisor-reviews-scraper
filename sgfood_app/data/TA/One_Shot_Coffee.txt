Good coffee at the outside lobby of prudential tower. Always busy during breakfast time, long queue. Only serve take away food and coffee, Try Highlander coffee (regular americano) than the other, I think its better and have stronger taste. the price was reasonable.

I have blasted ONE SHOT on my Instagram to no end!This is by far the best coffee shop in Singapore. Friendliest staff that remember your name and the best flat whites of my life!I will go out of my way when I am town to see them and get my ONE SHOT fix.You get a fantastic quote that will help get you through the day and they do not believe in ONE SHOT in your coffee, it is always two so the coffee is always flavorsome and rich!I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!AND - they do not charge the earth for a coffee - it is probably one of the cheapest in town

One Shot has been my favorite coffee shop, since they open at Prudential Tower. Do not let thier low-key style deceive you - their cappuccino is super smooth and you can't find any better anywhere in the town. Freshly ground with a proper espresso machine and very friendly stuff - it's a place you'll want to come again and again...And you don't have to break the bank to get a tasty western-style coffee
