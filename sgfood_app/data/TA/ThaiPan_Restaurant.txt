Have been frequenting this cosy restaurant in Siglap area for years. Price is still reasonable though they have been creeping up. Food is okay though I prefer the cooking several years back. Can get mix of Chinese food and some Thai food.

Heard so much about this place from friends living in the neighbourhood. Agree that this is a good place for casual family dinning. No frills but food tasted good in general. Good place to consider for eating out if feeling lazy to cook.

This restaurant is in the middle of an apartment complex called Mandarin Gardens. Look for the swimming pool and you will find ThaiPan nearby. The menu has a mix of Chinese zi char and Thai food. I had the dinner course so I am not sure if the lunch menu is different. The dinner menu had more zi char options, and some stellar dishes are the olive fried rice, butter prawns, and the orh nee dessert. Other usual zi char dishes served include three-egg spinach, steamed fish and seafood horfun

I brought my aunt and cousin here for lunch and they were impressed with the taste and quality of the food. I did think the portions seemed slighty smaller but the dishes were still delicious.We had the olive fried rice, which was popular as almost every table ordered it. The jing pork dish was also very good, as was the Thai style tofu and the sweet and sour chicken. The brocolli with egg was also cooked well.The only disappointment. If I could say that, was the orhnee. It was too blended, and all three of us would have preferred some more texture to the dish.Service was, as usual, friendly and quick, and parking is free in the condo's cmpound

We have eaten at ThaiPan restaurant on several occasions for many years and were always full of praise of the restaurant for its reasonably priced and delicious Thai-Chinese food. It was very rare for us to celebrate our sister's birthday as she stays in UK but we had full confidence that she would enjoy her birthday meal at ThaiPan.However, we were slightly disappointed with the service when my extended family was there for dinner to celebrate our sister's birthday last Sunday. We were there at 5:10 pm but the restaurant remains closed as it was only opened at 5:30 pm for dinner. There were 14 of us so we had reserved the huge table in a private "room", away from the other diners. Initially, the service was quite prompt as we were the first customers at the restaurant. We had our food served promptly but when the other diners came in later, we noticed that the service was rather lacking. There was a shortage of manpower as the staff seemed hurried, busy taking orders and serving drinks. I had to stand at the counter twice to request for the birthday cake to be served to our table but the staff were too busy to take out the birthday cake for us. We felt that our request was ignored or forgotten completely. As we had to vacate the room for another group of diners before 7:30 pm, we became quite anxious when the cake was not brought to us after a while. In the end, my brother had to collect the cake, paper plates and forks from the counter so that we can continue with our celebration. The table was obviously not cleared for the cake cutting as we had to pile up the empty plates to make space for the cake cutting.The quality of food was excellent and met our expectations. The signature dishes such as butter squid and cereal chicken and Jing Du pork chop were very popular with the children. The assam whole fish, claypot beancurd with seafood and broccoli with crabmeat were delicious and we could taste the fresh ingredients. We also had the sambal Kang Kong, prawn rolls and Hong Kong noodles. One of our family members declared that she likes all the dishes except the prawn rolls as the ingredients were quite different. As the large serving of food is sufficient for up to 10 persons, we had ordered a total of 11 dishes to cater for our group of 14 diners. We were disappointed that the yam basket with seafood was not available that evening. It was my sister's favourite dish as she hardly gets to eat it in UK. The total bill plus rice and drinks came up to S$240.00, which was very reasonable.Overall, our family had a wonderful meal at ThaiPan. We hope to eat the yam basket the next time we are there and hopefully, the staff will be more attentive and not be too stressed

This place is situated inside a condo named Mandarin Gardens. We went for a family dinner on the 7th day of Chinese New Year. It was almost full. We loved the place right from the time we entered. The staff was very courteous to helps us find the table. We ordered typical Chinese dishes like Mee Goreng, Chilly Crayfish, SzeChuan chicken, bean sprouts. The dishes were freshly prepared, very tasty and with good portion. The "small" dishes ordered also have very quantities. 3 Persons can easily share small portions of all dishes. There were lots of big Chinese families celebrating the 7th day of Chinese New year. Even with this rush, the food was served well in time. The staff was limited but they were very fast, courteous and served every table with smiles. The prices are also very reasonable. For 5 of us we ordered 8 dishes (appetisers + main course). Total bill was S$80. So overall a very good value for money. I would recommend a must visit in case you are around Siglap.

Located in Mandarin Gardens condominium, this Thai-Chinese restaurant is easy to reach. Been coming here since my secondary school and JC days.Good service and the food is really great, with the Cereal Chicken and butter squid dishes their top sellers. Many students from my alma maters; Victoria School and Victoria JC frequent this restaurant for meals. Expect crowds at peak hours.

We live at the condo (Mandarin Gardens) where ThaiPan is located. Once a month we get a takeaway for the family to enjoy around the pool or at the comfort of our home. Food is not outstanding but is quite nice to have it now & again. Children enjoy Hong Kong noodles, kailan veg, sweet & sour pork, pineapple rice...The service is fantastic though. The girls that work there are so attentive & always friendly. We order by phone or walk in & the food is ready for collection after 25-35min. Convenience, good food & friendly customer service are the winning points for ThaiPan Restaurant.
