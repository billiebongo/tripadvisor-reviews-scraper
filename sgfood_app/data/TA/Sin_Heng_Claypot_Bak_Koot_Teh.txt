Other than their service which is ok, the rest is terrible.
Pork rib soup tasted like sugar added. Pork ribs tasted as if they are frozen for months.
Prawns tasted rubbery and horrible.
Skip !

Most Singaporean bak kut teh is (to me at least, no offence to those that like it) pepper water. This is one of the few places that sell the herbal-flavoured good stuff!

If you go there for lunch, go early as it gets crowded. The BKT is really quite good, and the servings are generous, more than at other possibly better places. Quick service despite the demand

We tried both the teo chew style and hokkien style bak kut teh and enjoyed both. The broth was tasty, the meat were succulent, and the fried kailan with garlic was superb.

This is one of the few outlets still serving hot steaming food in the wee hours of the morning in the Joo Chiat area. We were told that they close at 4am and this must be a blessing for those who frequent the watering holes in the vicinity.Looks like this restaurant is manned by mostly workers from Mainland China which means communication could be a problem because these guys do not speak any English or local dialect at all. However service was quite okay and the pork served in the claypots were not bad at all, taste-wise and texture-wise, above average I would say.Definitely a great place for a BKT fix for dinner or supper

Have tried this many times and so far this has been one of the few good ones around. Service is not very good probably due to manpower shortage. Expect queues at dinner time. Like the dark bak ku teh soup as compared to the peppery ones.

Not as good as the hype made it out to be. We had a mixed bkt and they mixed in Dried bean curd, canned mushrooms and I believe canned sweet corn also. So their herbal soup tasted more of these I ingredients than the herbsTheir barley was from packets.Their dried bkt was good though so if you go...just ask for the straight but with spare ribs only...and their dry bkt..Overall quite average....I think the family got complacent since business is So good..

We tumbled across this place by chance, my gf loves Baku Teh and has been a huge fan of the Malaysian ones. This is a decent option if you are not travelling to Malaysia often, the service was quick and good. Side dishes were also up to standard. Free parking just outside of rising court and that is a huge plus. Must try at least once

As with carrot cake, some prefer their BKT black, others white. The one is the black kind, with plenty of herbs and spices, fragrant and delicious. The ribs are tender; the special version comes with innards. They serve other dishes than just BKT - ngo hiang, sesame oil chicken, fish, prawns, aubergine or other vegs, tau hu, omelette, etc. But no Yu sheng at Sin Heng. Those gaining too much weight can go to the acupuncture slimming centre next door

Well, I actually prefer the white bak koot teh a.k.a. the peppery type. But I do take black bak koot teh a.k.a. the herbal type. And this is the one that I like. The herbal taste in the soup is just nice for me, not too strong, not too bland. I usually order their sesame oil chicken claypot, sambal kangkong (morning glory) and their fried egg with onion. What I love is that you can just ask for refill of soup! I love to drink soup, hence it's a good place for me! I would recommend you to try! Of course, all our taste buds are different. So, you will never know if you like it until you try it

Our food was tasty and it served us well after a long day. The prices are good and food comes quickly. They don't accept credit cards. Open until late.

Sin Heng Claypot Bak Koot Teh has mixture of Singapore and KL style . It's good but the place is hot.

Very tasty pork soup boiled in traditional Chinese way with rich medicinal herbs. The staffs speaks English and Mandarin. They waiters are very helpful and takes the lead to recommend food for tourists. The price is very reasonable.

Other than pork ribs, they have many other dishes which are good too.
I like their soup over those pork ribs soup which contains pepper and garlic only.
This is only of my usual dinning place since it is near my apartment.

I ordered a medium-sized prime ribs claypot, a bowl of fried fritters, a mixed liver/kidneys soup claypot and rice.The ribs soup is a winner here.The ribs are all tender enough.I like the soup here. It's the peppery type soup (teochew) but with some herbs (or maybe just soy sauce) so the soup here is black and not the teochew type which is 'white'.I would say the ribs and soup here are as tasty as Song Fa's.The liver/kidneys though, is sub-par. They were over-cooked. If this is standard for them, then I think you can give this a miss.Yes, I would visit here again

Ordered a medium sized claypot BKT (herbal) to share at $14. There's 4 pieces of pork ribs and a few mushrooms and pork liver. $14 for 4 pieces of prom ribs , is more expensive than other BKT places like Ng ah sio/founders.Yam rice was also not available when i visited the place . I feel that this place was a little overhyped .

I kinda a regular here.. Whenever I am back to Sg, I will want to dine here as I love the black soup base.Location- it's abit hard to find so grab a cab or park at katong 112 walk about 5 mins to hereFood consistency- it's always good each time we go for the regular clay pot bak kut tehService- depends on the staff, not all are very friendly typePrice- reasonable Selection- good as besides the main dish, they are many other selection to choose from like fish, prawn, chicken , vegetables etcWhat I recommend to order:- the main rib soup as the meat are more and tender( get a small or medium will do) as soup is refillable - the omelette egg (sometimes it's too oily) but the taste is really good and fluffy!! - the clay pot black sauce mixed organs, it's piping hot and the sauce is superb- the fried dough to dip in the soup- chilli Kang Kong (spicy yet flavorful)- white rice to go with the food- chestnut drink is small cup and abit over sweet

Decided to come here for breakfast today. It was definitely the right decision. Coming in before 9am and there are still tables around and parking isn't so crazy yet. We ordered the special Bak Kut Teh which has the assortment of ribs, liver, Beancurd skin, etc. On first taste of the soup, it has the herbal aroma smell and not the peppery type of Bak Kut Teh. The pork ribs are tender and easy to tear apart. 10 points for the Bak Kut Teh. We also ordered the braised pork knuckles and bean sprout. Both turn out very well. Pork knuckles are braised in soy sauce to be very tender. The sauce is great to be over the bowl of white rice. The bean sprout on first look does not seem appetising. But after the first mouth, it was crunchy and has bits of salted fish in it. It was very nice

Come here because of the review and near my hotel in Katong area. Arrived here around 18.30 and still not so crowded. Order by the auntie , and she's also recommend the best food in here . Bak kut teh come around 10 minutes after that , soup are little bit clear with a strong taste of herbal . Ribs are big , yummy and soft . Fried Rice are very yummy and overall if you need a quick service come earlier .

I eat here regularly because I live around the corner. I find the bak kut teh ok so don't understand why the long queues every day and night. Their other dishes are ok too but I find it inconsistent. As others have stated, there's not much of an ambiance with this place and the food is not well presented but still a good place to have quick dinner or lunch at a reasonable price. And best not to drive here as not many places to park. Parking inspectors and wheel clampers all day all night even on Sunday nigh
