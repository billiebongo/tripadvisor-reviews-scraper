This second outlet is in an industrial estate where parking is more available than their first, allowing diners to enjoy a hearty meal in a relaxed and causal setting.

The double volume space was sparingly decorated but don't let that stop you from visiting the place. The food was delicious and the service manager was very polite.

Staff were very attentive, location a bit tricky to find. lunch sets were not bad ... pork rendang could have been a bit more tasty.

This week's family gathering was held at Garang Grill, after having heard rave reviews from other friends.For starters, the honey mustard wings with a fantastic crust were a tasty way to kick things off. We followed that up with the sinfully fatty pork jowls, and the full bodied sweet potato mash which still had some chunks in! Great for adding a bit of texture. We shared the Garang red platter between 8 people, and went with the ribeye instead of the beef short ribs. This turned out to be an excellent choice - the steak was perfect, marbly goodness, especially paired with the mustard sauce.The lamb was also tender and excellent, though (we felt) slightly undercooked. When highlighted to the manager Ishaan, he promptly replaced this with another rack of lamb chops without hesitation.We enjoyed the food but were thoroughly impressed by the excellent service provided by Ishaan and his team. We will definitely be back. On a side note, they are having a 10% off the total bill still

Was looking forward to a good feast of grilled food at Garang Grill, but was sorely disappointed by the experience.The meats (we tried their beef and Barramundi fillet) were alright in terms of flavours. The Barramundi skin was in fact, overly charred. These, for fine dining prices. The portions were also quite small.The concept is also quite confusing. The staff were dressed in shirts and pants â€“ fine dining style. But the place was decorated casual cafe style. And so was the way the food was served (utensils, plating). The menu is just a flimsy piece of magazine paper. With a name like "garang grill" and a huge "#trulysingaporean" hashtag printed next to the signage, you'd expect some kind of local feel to the concept (food or deco) but that was lacking.Overall, a very lackluster effort for what sounded like an exciting concept with great food. Hope the management can look into improving the experience quickly

Just opened in this location, might be a bit challenging to find. This is BYO restaurant, so make sure to bring a good bottle with you. Food is super creative and delicious. We had lunch meat fries which very extremely tasty (and creative!). Foie Gras satay was delicate and simply melting in the mouth; same were crab rillettes. We also had steak which perfectly cooked. Very good service, prompt and attentive

Awesome Cabonara!I know the place is fairly new but did not expect to have the entire restaurant to ourselves during the meal. Hence it was a lovely quiet meal for us.This being our first visit, we didn't know what to order. The staff respectfully gave us space & time to study the menu but it would have been better if they had offered suggestions. Ordered the Angus Beef Short Rib for hub & my 1st born but the gula melaka made it too sweet for their liking. Lemak Mussels turned out too spicy for my kids although we checked & staff confirmed it wouldn't be spicy. Crab Rillettes was an interesting fusion & the Ham & Cheese Baked Bread brunch was really cheesy.Smoked Pork Carbonara turned out to be their hot favourite. The menu says the Carbs would be good for 2 or 1 garang diner but the serving was just normal. Any of my younger 2 (who are small eaters) would have been able to finish 1 serving by themself. Our experience would have been better if:1. suggestions/ recommendations were given for food orders,2. we were seated in a more central location with a view (rather than in a corner, next to the toilet, especially since we were the only diners in the restaurant!)3. more attentive refill of water or leave a canister for self serviceIt was disappointing to read that they actually served yusheng after we left the restaurant. We would certainly have ordered if the staff informed us yusheng was available! Also, although I indicated that we were there for hub's birthday brunch in my booking, there was no 'Birthday' specials/offers. We normally order desserts with our meals but kids were disappointed with their experience & asked to adjourn elsewhere for dessert. Even with the discount, our meal came up to almost $30 per pax, I'd say a tad on the pricey side for mains alone. On the whole, I'd say this place has potential. Meanwhile, they would need some twitching & attention to details in their service.

Excellent grill. We were very impressed with the nice char on the ribeye and lamb cutlets. Do try the steak with just a touch of the house smoked sea salt. They offer a good red table wine. Good service. It is not cheap, however. But we will be back with friends

We, about 13 of us, had the set dinner at S$60.00 ++ per head. Starters - Luncheon meat fries with sambal mayo. Chilli crab rillettes served with fried mantou. Can't say much about luncheon meat fries or luncheon meat that passes off as French Fries. But the chilli crab rillettes were something else. Its chilli crab in pate form which you spread on your fried mantou. Truly for those who would have a hard time spreading crab chilli crab meat from traditional chilli crab meat dish. Great taste and getting you ready for the First EntreeFirst Entree - Uni-Ikura oysters with ponzu dressing. Carabinero prawn sashimi with deep fried prawn head. Live Scottish Scallops. This was the first real test because it was all about freshness and it passed easily. The Ikura was going down easy even without any Japanese Sake. The deep fried prawn head was unusual for me because I don't et prawn head but this was fried to a biscuit crisp and it just crunched well for me. And to top off the freshness index there was the live Scottish scallop. That went down well too in the absence of Scotch whisky.Second Entree - Grilled whole Norwegian Mackerel. Garang vegetable platter. Looked a lot like the Saba I would have had in a Korean or Japanese restaurant but this was Norwegian. My favorite was the belly area and that melted in my mouth. Would not have mattered if it was from Norway for the rest of the fish. But we were making our way upstream I guess from crab to ikura to prawn to scallop and getting stymied by the vegetable platter. The vegetable platter was ordinary but it was the only green we will get this whole night so let's get it on.The Main Course - Beef short ribs. Lime leaf chicken. USDA Prime Rib Eye. Garlic Fried Rice. Garang Rice. I guess this would have to be the raison d'etre for the restaurant. You had the short ribs which was soft and just came off the bone easily. But the USDA Prime Rib Eye was the one dish that topped everything else. In small slices and it was a challenge trying to pretend you were still just having your first piece and hoping that the rest of your friends were vegetarians. The Lime Leaf chicken was a nice twist on just the lime leaf and not the lime. Lime twist get it? And where would the Asian theme not sneak in with the Garang Rice and the Garlic Fried Rice? It was good but a difficult partner to the beef. Desserts - there were 4 categories. The sticky date with salted caramel ice cream. The Mao Shan Wang creme brulee. The chocolate Alexander with vanilla bean ice cream and the cheese platter. I would really zero in on the MSW creme brulee and while confessing taht I don't eat durians this creme brulee really made it easy for me to appreciate. Durian purists would do well to stay away because its not the same feel and substance but the taste was there. The other ice cream dishes were as expected sweet to the palette recently peppered with garlic rice. And the cheese platter was our conversation linger for the rest of the night with our French red wine.At S$60.00 ++ per head in a warehouse complex it would seem surprisingly expensive but with the company we had and the privacy of an upstairs loft type platform it was really worth it. The car park was free and ample. In fact you could even park just outside the back of the restaurant. I suppose this will be a difficult location for walk ins and a word of mouth campaign would have to be in order for the word to literally get around. If you live or work around Bukit Merah, Mount Faber or even Queensway you would have no problems finding this place. I understand that there is a very reasonable down to earth lunch menu that is below S$15.00 but that would have to be another time and another day.Bottom line - if you had a large group and you were celebrating a hole in one (like the table next to us) then this would be perfect to feel bourgeoisie and yet not pay bourgeoisie. I would be paying S$120.00 per head if this were Orchard Road
