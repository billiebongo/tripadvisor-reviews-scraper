Very fresh sushi and seafood. We tried also coocked food and found perfectly cooked. Super crunchy fish and delicious tempura.
Nice restaurant located on top Suntec City Tower one. Good staff as well.
Don't expect too many choices of food anyway.

Consistently good service and delicious food!
Lots of choices on their set lunch menu.
I had the fish, half sashimi and half tempura, while my wife had half sashimi and grill.
The staff are attentive and courteous.

Visited this japanese restaurant for family dinner. Ordered the Can Can Mushi, hot-pot with soy sauce & miso soup taste great. The Isaki grilled fish is grilled to perfection. Recommend the Wagyu beef and pork belly charcoal grill.

You can enjoy nice cold beer without paying extra like other restaurant. Foods are very delicious and service is fantastic. Highly Recommend it to food and drink lovers.

Had birthday celebration dinner and very pleasantly surprised by excellent friendly service. Food was really good and delicious- variety was unique and much better than the usual fare at other Japanese restaurants. The best part was it didn’t burn a hole in your pocket! Definitely recommended

This place in in the Sky Garden of Suntec or close so it is kind of in a mall. It is pretty upscale but the food is really fresh and super nice presentation. It must be authentic since everyone was Japaneses and looked happy. I was at a show so a great break and a good find

Sumiya this is the Japanese restaurant for good Japanese food. All dishes that we had are seasonal and prepared from the imported day’s catch. Good quality ingredients used, which you can really taste in the food. The meal filled me up effectively, and I left contented. Compared to other Japanese restaurants, this one has a far superior quality and better value for money. The service is personable, the food presentation and taste of the dishes impeccable. I will be back again soooon

Located at Suntec's 3rd level "Japanese corner" the restaurant had a wide selection of sake and other liquors to go with your food. Their range of seafood is also very good and you can personally select various fishes displayed at the corner serving counter. Service was very good and so was the food but be prepared to pay more! The "fresh" seafood items were expensive as were most of their sakes and liquors and even the sets were on the more expensive side. The eight of us, including our domestic helper who only had the seafood fried rice, and three kids below six paid about S$580 for dinner which also included two small bottles of sake. Recommended if you are prepared to pay a bit more for the food, drinks, service and ambiance.

Patronised Sumiya last weekend with a friend, as the selection of grilled items looked promising. We ordered skewers of meat balls, chicken, eel and eggplant, and complemented our orders with a $8.8 rice and soup set (the rice and miso must be airflown from Japan, given the premium in pricing - though our layman palate was unable to discern otherwise). Our orders of meat balls, eel and eggplant arrived around 10-15 mins later, one after another. While our chicken skewers were still 'not in sight'. We asked the service staff and were told there was a 'jam in the kitchen'. We were subsequently reassured twice (by 2 different service staff, at different intervals) that our chicken skewers will be served in 5-6 mins time - that adds up to another 10-15 mins wait. (according to the staff, the chicken skewer takes around 20 mins to cook) Unable to wait any longer for our 'chicken flight' to 'land' on our table, we asked for the manager. After around 5 mins, we were attended by a male staff who brought 2 chicken skewers (finally - after around 30 mins from the time we placed our orders) to our table - only to be met with our frustration, as we had already finished whatever food we ordered.To cut the long story short, we rejected the chicken skewers (we were really planning to have them for dinner - not as backup plan for supper) and declined to be charged service charge - with some resistance and initial insistence from the restaurant.Will we return? Certainly not. The staff would be glad that we don't as well. Why? The quality of the food and service does not warrant the premium price charged - not to mention you might be in for a 'flight delay' treat from the kitchen.A better alternative for Japanese food is Emporium Shokuhin located in neighbouring Marina Square - great quality of food and much reasonably priced

Authentic japanese food, wonderful service, wonderful ambience, it was just splendid! The staff of the afternoon shift of 18 March 2017 was fantastic! Keep up the good job team! You deserve a pat on your back!

If you are looking for cjeap and good Japanese beer you can consider this place. They have 2 outlets (another one is at Orchard)All day happy hour Sapporo Beer $4.8/mug (for Suntec City outlet) Asahi draft beer $5.8/mug (for Orchard Central outlet)Go for their charcoal grill item example: shisamo, salmon belly, assorted vege skewers (nice and not oily), fish cheek, fish bone, fish of the day (check with the restaurant)Don't know why their Edamame is so yummy (we ordered 3 order large size) $9.6The fried cheese in paper roll is abit on oily side. We ordered the roll sushi on stairs (6 pieces), so so only (you can skip this) just the presentation looks something different onl

We went for Saturday lunch because all friends went for lunch and think it was good. The restaurant was packed with guests and we were impressed with the sake machine near the entrance. First, the menu is abit small and only serves limited ingredients (or they called chef's recommendation). Food quality overall were quite good but the speed of service is a bit slow and we were pissed off that the table next to us somehow might know the manager but they got all dishes as priority. Will go there again but not on weekends' evenings

Children loved it. Garlic fried rice and the terayaki chicken, chicken meat ball, wayu beef and cuttlefish. Adults enjoyed the grilled and hot pot dishes of grilled fish collar, miso soup fish head, chicken collagen soup, crab meat rice. Then, there is the usual sashimi and sushi rolls. Overall a very good experience with well trained and motivated service and a very good atmosphere

One of my fav Japanese restaurants! Great on all fronts - fresh quality, awesome display, attentive and friendly service, good selection of sake, relaxing ambience ... They've never failed me - I always feel sooo HapPy after a meal there (hic! Partly due to the sake too, I guess

The rating is for the food and service which were excellent. The skewers and fish were delicious and the service friendly and efficient. However the portions of each dish seemed a bit too small and we found ourselves ordering some more dishes at the end of the first set of dishes. A little bit on the expensive side, but can be justified with the fresh fish on display, apparently from Japan.

Excellent service staff especially Fiona & Reginna and 2 others i failed to notice their names. Very attentive and helpful. However all other aspects failed. -Absolutely nothing special about the seriously OVERpriced food. Similar Jap food can easily be found in Sg at much lower prices.Paid $210 for 4pax for an utterly unfulfulling meal.-Nothing special about the ambience and dated Jap pop playing in the background.I'd suggest that you check out the many other Japanese restaurants at Eat@Seven on the same floor at Suntec City Mall

I have visited this restaurant several times and each time the quality and service has been good. There is a wide selection of Sake/Sochu as well as Izakaya food. I find the Chirashidon especially good and value for money. They should just keep to the bowl serving instead of using a plate, otherwise the food as well as the dips are good. For lunch be prepared to spend around $30 pax and $50 pax if you want a satisfying meal.This is the place I would go to to satisfy my craving for Sumiyaki and sashimi
