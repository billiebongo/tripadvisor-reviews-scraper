I always interested on the pastry.. I mean ALL their pastry. all taste delicious and the green tea drink is great as well.

This was recommended by a friend and was curious to try their pastries. Im not a coffee drinking so i went straight to the pastries. I must admit they are tasty and freshly baked. The signature chococro is a must try.
5
Lovely little coffee shop in VivoCity. I like their coffee a lot but the pastries are the ones to come back for again and again.
5
everything was on point, the service, the crews, the baristas, they were all friendly. would love to try their little fuji again!!

Glad that this Japanese chain is here, most things rock. Don't expect sweet fresh strawberry pieces from Japanese farms on your chosen strawberry desserts though - they relied on frozen pieces here!

Ordered ice coffee latte and caramel latte. Both were too much ice, caramel one was too sweet though.
Queue was fast moving, service staff was energetic and friendly.
4
Loved the glass with chocolate in and the little saucepan of hot chocolatie milk to pour yourself but it was very rich and strong bitter dark chocolate. Just a little to much for me but you did get 2 glasses worth from it so good value.

We ordered 2 drinks using entertainer 1 for 1 - iced caramel latte and butterscotch latter. The caramel latte tasted really delicious, but the butterscotch one was very bland.Went back to the counter, told them it was bland, and they just poured more coffee inside. There's now wayyyyy too much coffee, and everything tasted just bitter and horrible. Went back again, and finally got them to change the drink, which tasted proper now. My guess is that they were too busy and they got the mix ratio wrong. Might have mixed it for a medium instead of large..Anyway, they should have just changed the drink, instead of trying to "fix" it by adding coffee. I'm sure there's a proper mix ratio for all the drinks. You can't just top it up with coffee if you've got it wrong in the first place.Other than that, the place seems pretty good value with entertainer 1 for 1. The desserts smell really good, and we probably will try that again next time.

Visited on 11/7/2016 with my mother. As is early so juz 2 tables occupied. Cashier is patient n courtesy for explaining my enquiries of which desserts that I could choose as I'm using the Entertainer App, so I tried Strawberry Heaven $8.80, yummy vanilla soft serve, strawberry cubes, cornflakes. (Fuji chocolate strawberry) forget it's description. Is crispy but soft serve start to melt before I took pic. Tried Chococro, it's very crispy, butter croissant w yummy choco. Will visit whenever passed by its outlet.

(1) Classic Fuji - nice warm pastry with vanilla soft serve and red bean paste(2) Matcha Milk - shaved ice drizzed with matcha and vanilla soft serve and red bean paste. Didn't try it but my hubby finished it. Nice cooling dessert. Good value with Entertainer 1-1 Ap
2
It was the least crowded for a reason and value for money thanks to discount app. Black coffee taste diluted.
5
One of my favorite coffee is ice Vietnam coffee here. After long walking for shopping, must try this coffee. Even in Japan I always try this coffee!!! I really love it!!!
4
I tried the ice cream with nuts.for the price of 5.60 it was a great treat..vanilla ice cream overflow the cone..rich and creamy..i hope they have more flavours of ice cream though.
4
Tried the Kyoto dessert and the Choco berry dessert. They looked very appealing and they tasted good too
4
2nd times to here. I fell in love with their desserts. Delicious ice creams, pastries and coffee. Just that their red bean too sweet. Next time will try their mocha ice cream on the Kyoto delight. Yummy....
4
Desserts here are great, the drinks served here are good accompaniments. Hot drinks are served too hot though, would be good if it were served ready-to-drink. Overall, I will definitely come back.
5
Nice atmosphere, few but extremely good selections, Choco cro best I have tasted, pastries also very good, brownies are not their speciality
4
The desserts are very good - mini Kioto and the pies are perfect for somebody that has a sweet tooth. Unfortunately service is very unorganized, they forget about the orders, you need to wait a long time for your coffee. Coffees are so-so, it;s better to have just a dessert
4
Ordered Miyako and Choco banana waffle and preferred the latter! Both are pretty sweet but that's what desserts are meant to be! Waffle tasted more like bread, with an interesting twist. Both desserts can be quite filling, so consider sharing first and order more if you want to. City hall branch is always packed and not easy to get a table. Probably the biggest downside
3
Fell in love with all the Tasty Iced Beverages , be it Milk Tea or Vietnam Coffee! Pastries always fresh too. A pity that that staff unable to manage the seating area during weekends and public holidays.... was turned off having troubles looking for table, ended up with takeaways & hang out at the promenade. Perhaps some customers do realise that there's a pool of Marc fans out there waiting for tables, please give others a chance to enjoy too ;)
3
For the quality of tea and coffee here the prices are steep. You could easily get better teas & coffee for the same price elsewhere.
Nope, we won't be back.
5
Brought the banana split sundae. Taste soo good. The store looks very pretty and the bakery smell pulled me towards it.
5
Finished watching the formula 1 very late and got to saint marc just as they were closing up. Infact the till was already closed but with little persuasion and seeing how keen we were to try their dessert they decided to let us seat. The ambience was good and when the dessert came it was very lovely
4
Really enjoy eating their crunchy and fresh from oven croissant! The chococro is a must try here and the fuji desserts as well. So far, I've tasted the classic fuji (Danish pastry with vanilla matcha soft serve and azuki bean) and the little fuji (Danish pastry with vanilla soft serve and caramel syrup). Both are worth trying and the price is quite in the cheap range
5
If you are down to East Coast Park, this new East Coast Park Greenland is quite an attractionIt has nice food and St Marc is definitely of them. The staff r friendly and helpful.The iPad used to order food has made viewing of menu easy n clear.The food tasted really good esp the Wagyu beef burger. Ambience is very much chillout n I will certainly go back again
4
I was at Marina Square and thought that a cup of mocha would be a good idea. I walked into St Marc's cafe and its wait staff are all very efficient in taking and serving me. The ambience was great. I found a cozy spot to laze n the mocha tasted just right for me. Yummy

With so many coffee chains, what differentiates this Japanese entrant? Different drinks (eg. Việtnamese coffee - way too sweet, though; ask them to put less condensed milk), or light fusion dishes (some not so successful, like a limited-edition Chili Crab Croissant, made with fake crab, for SG50 celebration). More importantly, prices are lower than the competition (Starbucks, Coffee Bean, Costa, etc), almost at par with McCafé but offering a much nicer environment

We’ve seen St. Marc cafes before in the malls (they have outlets at Vivocity, Marina Square and Raffles City), but never tried them somehow. We were pleasantly surprised when we eventually tried their branch at ECP, which is a Bakery & Bar. St. Marc originated from Tokyo, and serves Japanese fusion desserts, breads/pastries, and drinks. The outlet at ECP also offers reasonably priced meals/ mains.The place is typically packed during weekends, though it is a pleasant place to hangout with friends, read a book over coffee or do some work near to the seaside. Our favourite so far are their Japanese desserts, which have not disappointed us so far.For more information and photos, refer to our blog at https://angiekayexplorer.wordpress.com/2015/05/16/review-of-st-marc-bakery-bar-east-coast-park-singapore

Non-existent service on a quiet weekday afternoon - but hey, no service charge, right? The steak frites, however... my order of medium-rare came pale, flabby and mostly done apart from a 20% strip on the side, while my friend's identical order had to be sent back because it was pretty much sashimi apart from an outside "sear". (His slab of meat came equally... pale.) We both received meat cuts that were basically 20% fat. Served so cold, the pat of herbed butter on top wouldn't melt. Skinny shoestring fries rather than the de rigeur thick-cut for frites. I left thinking we were being punished, but I'm still not sure what for

Came here for a coffee after lunch at the Marina Square outlet today. I had a cappuccino whilst my colleague had a latte. Both were served luke warm and without much effort with presentation. Having visited 40 Hands Cafe in Tiong Bahru earlier in the week I was really quite disappointed with St Marc. Not really inspired to try it again
4
Enjoyable atmosphere, good desserts. All the times we have visited the Marina square location as its nice and has lots of seats so there is always room even when crowded. The quality of desserts are always consistent and always pleasing.

We ate at the branch at Parkland Green (East Coast Parkway). This place could be a lot better but it is managed very very poorly. We have dined here 4 times so we have given them a few chances already. The first thing we noted after we sat down at our table was a dirty spoon, so we told one of the waiters about it. The waiter looked at it and just took it away without saying anything to us. No apology, no mention of whether they would replace it, nothing. The next thing was when they served us hot tea, the manager served it to us himself but he decided to do it over my toddler's head! We were quite concerned but he had place it on the table before we could say anything and then he briskly walked away. Anyway to summarise, service here is terrible. Food here is hit or miss, some items are okay and some are not so good, e.g. the pancakes are hard and dry which is really strange. They're not cheap either, a cup of tea is SGD6, while starbucks next door is charging SGD4.20. Anyway, its a shame because the location is beautiful and the restaurant has a nice design

Really slow disorganised service. Took them awhile to get the table ready for us. Would have been quicker if the first person we were greeted by handled the seating but we were passed to a difderent person twice which resulted in total confussion.We ordered our coffees and pastries. After awhile (15-20mins) we were looking around for a staff member to find out where they were which took an age. Eventually the pastries arrived on one plate. We asked for indervidual plates but they never got delivered to the table so ended up using napkins.By the time we were nearly finished the pastries the coffees arrived, again after chasing a staff member. Had to send one drink back as it was wrong. After waiting for the wrong coffee to come back eveyone else had finished and ended up cancelling the error.Staff smiled and were friendly when you got to speak to one. They really need a manager that can run a service as at the moment its disorganised and slow.The coffee is from an automatic machine so no excuse for slowness....also means the coffee is not that good....no control over the shot or the foam
1
Easy to sum this place up. Excellent location, nice decor, below reasonable food, poor service. We visited on a Tuesday lunch time; 20 minutes after ordering, our drinks arrived. Fifty minutes after ordering, our daughter got her dish but everyone else had finished theirs. None of the food was worth the wait. I had ordered a Greek salad, but a garden salad arrived so I requested it be changed, but when it returned it was the same salad, but with some feta added. Even that delivery took three questions to the waitress about where the food was. All in all, a disappointing experience and not one we will repeat or recommend

St. Marc Bar and Bakery at the East Coast Beach has probably one of the prettiest locations in Singapore... newly opened, the café looks out onto the East Coast Beach, with seating options both inside and outside... the menu is decent with variety for breakfast and all-day dining... the prices are ok... one does wish the restaurant would add "something" for vegetarians :)... at the moment there is not much besides a Butter Croissant and a couple other things... a great place to chill, especially on a week-day... the staff is courteous and pleasant... all in all a nice place to visit.

Walked by the place a couple of times, the deserts looked enticing, was curious about what "matcha" was. Finally picked up a Chocoro and asked for, "the green drink" - selected to have a cold one. Also got up the courage to ask what the green drink was made of! Staff was very polite. Both the chocoro and the matcha were awesome. Would love to visit again to try the other items and also repeat the matcha. This was the outlet in Raffles City

I Just know about this cafe. Walking around and found this cafe.I try the chocoro and the expresso jelly dessert.Fantastic.The chocoro is like croissant with chocolate filling inside. The expresso jelly is very uniqe. You will eat vanila ice with matcha topped with jelly. The most uniqe is under the bowl, they add a little of black coffee. So you will eat ice vanila, matcha and black coffe. Uniqe and tasty.

This is the perfect dessert and hangout place in Singapore. Good quality ice cream and great flavour. Always can't decided which one to go for as it is all so good! Definitely try the ice cream crossiant! The macha drink is good too! Stay in Singapore forever! Please open one in Nex!

In 2012, I went to Japan Osaka . I had enjoyed a nice coffee and bread in "Namba" station. The taste is same like a tasted in Singapore St. Marc Café (Marianne Square) recently! I already tried the coffee, cake, bread and ice cream!(Visited 5 times already) I really like Japanese ice cream, I really different from other local ice cream! Smooth and easily melt in your mouth! Important is no so sweet! Chocolate Bread smell good taste nice.. especially with hot coffee
