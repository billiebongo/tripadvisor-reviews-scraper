Nice location, and wonderful environment. But not much food to choice. I like their yum paste and ginseng soup.

Having been away for 16 years, the yearning for meeting up friends and family is paramount. Gorogoro is the place to gather because you have all the right things in place.........the ambience, the spread and especially the warm hospitality they provide. I would also highly recommend travellers to visit and have a meal at Gorogoro. It’s value for money, the spread is fresh and lots of variety and choices. Go for the collagen soup (my favourite) and the chicken wings are fantastic

Korea and Chinese Steamboat- Goro-goro is definitely value for money. I just loved the collagen soup, and the buffet choices which has something for everyone- vegetarian, meat, seafood,chicken and sweetsLocation is at the 4th Floor and you won't see signages on the ground floor so it's definitely a by-word-of-mouth customer reach. But it's a perfect family and group restaurant with a very friendly, nice clean ambience. Definitely worth a visit when you are in Singapore!

We visited GoroGoro on Tuesday evening. it was very crowded although it is a weekday. The location of the restaurant is not very common but not difficult to find though. 90 minutes is good enough for steamboat buffet. Price is pretty reasonable. It is 63 bucks for 2 pax after 10% services charge and 7% GST. There is a variety of soups to choose and we chose Tom Yum and Mala soup. Both were yummy. I am okay with the level of spiciness but it is not suitable for one who does not have a high tolerance level of spicy. Vegetables were pretty fresh and quite a few to choose. Not marinated pork, beef, and chicken to choose for meat. Not many options for seafood as there were only mussel, squid and prawn. I did not see any crab and clam. Their signature fried chicken is super delicious and pancake too. Only negative is the buffet price does not include dessert. So you have to pay extra if you want to have any ice-cream. I would definitely go there again and recommend this place

Location wise is slightly weird at first, but nothing hard at finding it. 90 minutes of consumption time is just nice for a buffet and chitchatting among friends. Price are not super expensive. They have a few variety of soup choices and I definitely suggest tom yam for it. Ma la is a bit too spicy for me, but if u r okay with it, why not? Raw food and cooked food are both available and taste good. It's really one of my favorite buffet and i'll definitely going back there again. Most importantly, their seating capacity is big, so if u r there on weekday, u get to enjoy the the big places and it's not cramped like other SG buffet restaurant

They have both steamboat and cooked food so you can have both at one go. We had order tomato & collagen soup base but to me tomato taste a bit sour. They have good variety of cooked & raw food to choose including their popular Korean chicken wings & kimchi. Price are reasonable it only cost us $63.10 for both of us

We enjoyed our visit to GoroGoro. The basic concept was new to us i.e. You pick a couple of soups, which are placed on heaters in the middle of the table and then you collect various raw ingredients which you cook yourself in the soups. Great fun, really interesting and for us from Scotland, pretty unique.The downsides, however, were price a bit steep, restaurant a bit like an army mess and the food not always presented in an appetising way
5
Good variety of food at a reasonable price.Staff is friendly, especially the cashier (a lady) she asked for our feedbacks and if there was anything that can be done for improvement.She even explain that they are serving some signature/special salted egg yolk food item during weekends. She also gave me discount voucher .Will be back again

This steamboat restaurant is located inside Orchard gateway, just take the elevator up and directly you will see the restaurant. They offered many soup base and we have ordered ginseng and seaweed soup. The selection is a lot and they have both cooked and non-cooked items. One of the best is their signature korean fried chicken wing, it is in those soya sauce, not salty at all and still remain crispy after putting in the tray for a while. The time for eating is 2 hrs, more than enough for us to complete our food. Definitely will visit for their signature fried chicken wings again. As for price it is considered average and affordable for a buffet steamboat. Highly recommended

Booked a table for 10pax but restaurant is nice to allocate a table for 12 to us so we have ample space. Good variety of cooked food so besides having steamboat items, there’s French fries, fried scallop, Korean glass noodles, Korean rice cake etc.Plenty of steamboat items to choose from like chicken, pork, beef, fishball, prawnball, crabstick, luncheon meat, noodles, many types of vegetables, mushrooms.Soup base: Mala, Tom Yum, Collagen, Bak Ku Teh Drinks includes water chestnut, Korean tea, lime juice etc.Weekday lunch:Price: $16.80++ for adultPrice for senior/student is $14.80++ for weekRecommended to try

It is rare to find steamboat in the heart of Orchard at an affordable price. The spread is pretty good but beer and ice cream is chargeable. Friendly staff is a bonus.

Came to eat for two for dinner, we had the collagen base and mala base and both were fantastic! So tasty and good! Normally I don't drink much soup from hot pots but this was very good! The variety of cooked food was excellent too, loved the chicken wings, tripe mala stir fry and the chap chae! The sauce bar was normal but we didn't use almost any sauce because the food was great on its own with the soup.Overall we loved the huge range of fresh vegetables, mushrooms and meat/fishballs available as well! Totally super worth it and will go again with more people

Went there last Sunday (got free vouchers for 4) but not expecting much. The place is quite big and ambience very nice. The staffs are very friendly.Many variety of foods (the usual steamboat stuffs) but the ingredients are fresh. The section with cooked food is very nice, especially the fried chicken (although a little sweet) and the ngioh hiong is a very nice surprise.The place can only be access by a lift (inside Crate & Barrel at Orchard Gateway@emerald). you need to cross the road (or use the sky bridge) from the main building (this is the one connected to Somerset MRT). Took us some time to find the place!Overall a reasonable place to have Korean steamboat buffet right in Orchard Road

When I thought about cheap buffet restaurants in town, I'd be expecting sub-quality food with variety you can count with both hands.But besides being reasonably priced, GoroGoro surprised me with a commendable buffet spread with dishes that rivalled what I tasted in Seoul.The yummy sauce-coated chicken wings and salted-egg popcorn chicken (which is only available on weekends), satisfied my taste buds instantly. I feel these 2 dishes were worth the price of the meal!The funky restaurant ambience, screening of k-pop music and friendly staffs complete the K-wave experience.The restaurant can only be accessed via a lift to level 4.If you're in town near Orchard Gateway Emerald, and feeling hungry, give GoroGoro a go

So Glad in found this place! Please do take note it is located at the other side of Orchard gateway building above crate and barrel!This place able to host very big groups! Very good for gathering with friends.. however there is a 2 hour eating time limit..Many choice of Korean theme cook food.. love the salted egg chicken best I've eaten! And also the other side of the food variety is all raw food for steamboat!Many soup base to choose from.. my Favourite was Bak Kut Teh and collagen soup Base..Place was clean and modern and the price is less den 30$ per pax! Will definitely come again.

Cooked food was tasty, especially the Korean pancakes / har cheong gai / Korean chicken wings which are the recommendation from the manager. Ingredients for the steamboat too was a huge variety, meat was fresh and tender when cooked! Not much dessert except for fruits and a warm ginkgo barley soup. Free flow of some drinks (barley tea, mango, lime juice etc) but tasted quite diluted. Service were awesome, friendly staff and efficient in topping soup or clearing the plates. Collagen soup is a must try!!

Location is excellent since it's just across Somerset MRT. A good choice if you prefer a place with no lunchtime queue and with a buffet spread at an affordable price. Food spread is reasonable for the price. Other than dishes for steamboat, cooked food (including fries, fried scallop, Korean pizza and cake, vermicelli etc), is also available.Taste of the food is average. Free flow of drinks is included in the buffet price
5
It's worth the money and it has a wide variety of vegetables. The meat selection is limited but it's because you pay a relatively cheap price. The place is clean but a little small but it's still good enough. You have to take a lift to level 3 from the lobby at the Crate & Barrel side of Orchard Gateway. You can't reach the restaurant by escalator

Went with my family of 6 for our reunion dinner on CNY eve. We reached slightly early and everyone was just crowding around outside the restaurant as it was not ready to receive the guests yet. But staff on duty managed it well and we were all seated in an orderly manner. Place is nicely decorated and spacious. Staff are friendly and helpful. Food items were neatly displayed. Good variety of cooked and uncooked food. The Korean chicken wings & kimchi pancake yummy! Would be better if they offer more desserts options. Overall a pleasant experience, reasonably priced, will surely return again. :

If you are looking for great Korean Steamboat, this is the best place ever. Price, food, atmosphere, staff and service. Kudos to the management and staffs fully committed to serve the customers. Big thumbs up for this restaurant. Will be back again soon!!!

Dinner Buffet on Sat. The place was very big and modern.Place wise is quite central and convenient and comfortable.Not very crowded and well spaced out.Cooked food wise - Korean fried chicken , har cheong kai, glass noodle, tampoki, fried udon. Find korean fried chicken and glass noodle nice. The rest are so so.Steam boat wise, 2 type of soup, chosen mala and collagen. Mala wasnt too hot and collagen soup was quite nice. Raw food wise, find the beef the best out of the raw meats. Other things like crab stick, balls all that are just normal.Generally good quality wise is ok.Price wise slightly pricey due to weekend, around $70.Probably come again if it was cheaper, but in short term would probably not be back

As a buffet lover, I tend to try out different types of buffet with my partner. Having stumbled upon this place through Facebook, I decided to give it a try.We were the first one to arrive at 5.10pm . It was empty ( Monday evening). First impression of the place was, cool! Some of the dishes caught my eyes already. First off, they came with the soup selection, a total of 7 choices I think.(mala, Tomyam, chicken ginseng, tomato, herb(extra charges applies), vegetarian, collagen )I had the mala and collagen. You can also have 3 choices of soup base with an additional fee. After choosing the soup, first thing was to get the sauce. Standard steamboat buffet sauces condiment. However there is one thing I must highlight, the sambal is awesome and I'm a person who is quite particular about sambal. Kudos to that!If you are a vegetarian or vegan, selection of fresh vegetables are vast. It is very fresh and of course paired with the vegetarian soup. So, non meat eaters, you are safe to dine here and worth the penny!Staff were attentive, service was good. Maybe because it wasn't pack on a weekday evening. Overall experience was good. Reason for being "good not great" was because its just somewhat similar to other steamboat buffet. It doesn't quite have the "wow" factor which captures your heart entirely. However , doesn't mean that this place is bad. It's ranked above average for my liking. Might come back with a group of friends soon

When Korean delicacies meet the best in Chinese hotpot dining, you get the hidden gem that is Goro Goro. Some precooked eats and some raw meats - make this the feast the Gotham deserves. Fugitives from the popular Hai Di Lao (well known for its 2 hour waiting times) can walk accross the road here with a sigh of alacrity & take the Crate & Barrel elevator in Orchard Central to experience the yummyness at hand at Goro Goro on Level 4! Cute doodles & animated characters await you as you tuck into a meal that boasts some of the best hotpot variety in meats & cuts you can ask for. Let the meat & veggies boil to perfection with the delicious soup bases & you have yourself a great square meal perfectly enjoyed in groups. The service staff was friendly & pretty efficient. I would recommend this place without hesitation as a legit hotpot culinary chapter for a hungry-go-here evening in Singapore!

I've been to GoroGoro twice and both times the food has been great. The student price is extremely worth it at $13.90 for lunch on mon-fri. There's a large variety of food to pick from and free flow drinks. The only thing to note is that there is a $20 fine for every 100g of food waste so make sure to only take what you can finish!

Something different from the usual Korean BBQ buffet. Here it's steamboat style!I had the Tom Yam and Collagen Soup. Food ranged from many cooked dishes such as fried chicken wings, Toppoki stew etc, especially the FRIED PORK RIBS which was awesome! There were also many kinds of vegetables, meatballs, prawns, squids, meats to choose from. Service was friendly and helpful

The soup base was great. I took tom yam,mala and ginseng chicken. Mala soup was spicy but too oily and hence spoiled the fun. The other two soup bases were amazing and really good.To start off with, the cooked food counter was good and the staff were pretty attentive to be filling it up every now and then. The drinks were good as well.The fresh food counter (pork and chicken) was extremely fresh and really delicious. Also, staff were attentive to fill it up now and then to ensure sufficient meat for diners. THATS A PLUS POINT IN EVERY BUFFET.Staff only came to our table once to refill soup, and thereafter I had to call the staff. One good thing was that they made constant rounds to check on the used plate.Overall, it's an amazing Korean buffet restaurant.. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
