Never miss the chocolate Rainbow cake and frozen beer here. They have nice coffee too. But didn't like the salty egg Rainbow cake.

The staff are so bad attitude. Reluctant to serve and rude. Wouldn't ever visit this place ever again. Stupid service! Pay money to get such services. If the owner see this pls do something to your staff's attitude.

Love the rainbow cakes and frozen beer. Casual relax environment and GREAT prices. The restaurant is actually inside a community club. The burger, chips and salad are nice too. But best are the RAINBOW CAKES!

NOM is co-located with Macpherson CC and is pretty accessible, especially convenient for people who drive as there are plenty of carpark lots nearby.Everyone I have introduced this restaurant has given a thumbs up for the food they had and this is a great place for a cozy and comfy lunch. They recently introduced a set lunch price and grab it if they are serving Broccoli and Cheese soup as soup of the day.If you prefer vegetarian choices like me, you wont be disappointed as there is enough selection of tasty dishes for you. My all-time favourite is the Earth Burger.Other food choices for meat-lovers include the Ultimate NOM Burger, the salted egg yolk prawn pasta, any of the pizzas.Save some tummy space for dessert as they have a good selection of rainbow cakes!I frequent the joint and have never had much problem with service. In fact, they remember the regulars and would engage in friendly banter :

As our furkid was with us, we decided to come here for an early dinner. Ordered the BBQ teriyaki chicken pizza and the iced lemon tea. As usual, loved the pizza crust which was lovely and crispy. The BBQ teriyaki chicken came with some slices of seaweed that enhances the taste. Great place to enjoy a laid back dinner environment.

Was recommended by a friend to try this place as we were supposed to meet at MacPherson CC for a pet event. We were not disappointed. The best was the alfresco section where we could sit with our pet. Interestingly the name NOM stands for No Other Meaning. We tried the Sticky Pig pizza - pork belly and smoked pork bacon with 'char siew' sauce on a thin crust pizza base. It was yummy yummy... A great combination. Definitely will be back with our furkid again.

A little out of the way but a nice and laid back environment. Came here for dinner and for their famous rainbow cakes and was not disappointed. The light bites were great. e.g. stuffed mushrooms, fried chicken skin with homemade sambal and the roasted pork was roasted to perfection. Main course was pretty good too. I liked the chicken mushroom pesto pasta. Dessert was their famous rainbow cake in Speculoos buttercream and a banana dark chocolate cheesecake. Great food & great dessert, best way to end the day
