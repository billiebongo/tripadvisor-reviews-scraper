This a favorite Singaporean frozen yogurt joint with lots varied flavors and different types of yogurt bases. This joint serves up other healthy drinks as well. The seating is not that extensive and often times during peak hours you may not find a place to sit and enjoy your yogurt. The these frozen delights are always served in take away paper cups so you can just lick the spoons while roaming around in the malls. My favorite is the original yogurt with the chocolate chips but there are other varieties that you can choose from especially fresh fruits. They even have a loyalty card which, if you get too addicted to yoguru, is strongly recommended. Rather than having dessert at a restaurant i will always recommend this quaint little shop if there is one nearby
