Hadn't been a pleasant experience. Packed restaurant, staff were either grouchy or unattentive. Novice staff were slow in response. Had shown Changi Rewards card but rejected???

Looking for a nice lunch before our flight. We ordered fried rice, tofu, spinach, and yam paste for dessert. Service was good, and the food came out fast which is important as we have a flight to catch. Overall a good restaurant. I love my yam paste

This place is that everyone must try. The food is absolutely great although they waited too long to served my dessert to me. It melted.We ordered only 3 dishes and all of them were great. Service was abit slow but its understable due to the number of crowd that they are serving

We had our dinner here before leaving Singapore and I must say the food was simply delicious ! there was a promotion for Credit card and we had an add-on of pig trotters for only SD1 ! We could not finish the portions so we had to take away some. The Pumpkin spare-ribs oyster soup was superb

Though our reservation was for 12.30pm but not all in our group of 14 pax were there till slightly after 1pm although we had put through our lunch order when we arrived and told them to wait before serving. However, they started serving before everyone at the table had arrived. Even though we told them to hold off serving the other dishes for the time being, they continued serving and soon all the dishes were out. Someone in our group mentioned that they were trying to quickly turn over the tables but we did not feel good cos it was as if they were chasing us off. Though the food was served so fast, it was another matter with the drinks. We had to ask a few times before they finally got served. Food quality overall was good but staff on the other hand should be able to pay more attention to customers' needs in order to provide better servic

I'm not sure if we're ordering wrong dishes, but the foods were too oily to my liking. We're here because we like the one at Terminal 3 which I find just right, not oily. Service was good as expected and standard price for this chain restaurant.

Paradise group never once disappoint me with their quality of food. My favourite is 'dong bo ruo' braised pork. I'm never a pork fat person, this is the only restaurant that has gotten me crazy over this dish. It simple melts in your mouth! Best dish ever and none other restaurant has beaten you on this! Great awesome service from staff too! Highly recommended for business or family. Has been patronising them when they only have one restaurant in defy lane. The many chains of restaurants has proven their quality in Singapore market

I was looking for a quick lunch at the airport before leaving, and saw this place look quite promising. Turned out, it's even better than just a quick lunch. Their soup is hot and delicious, beside other tasty choice. I especially like the way they served tea, flora tea, in glass pot and glass cup. So pretty

Good food, good taste.. clean restaurant.. helpful staff.. when i arrived in morning, so i'm the only customer.. the staff walking around my table several times.. quiet annoyig for me.

Went on a weekday to have lunch with family. Overall food was delicious and staff were attentive. They were quick to respond to our request and questions. Food was not too expensive but portion could be bigger.
5
All the food here is good. Service is always on point. Recommend Wasabi Prawns, Dongpo Rou, and Seafood Fried Rice.

Still be the best Chinese restaurant in Changi Airport in my view. This time I try beef noodle which is very good but will be better it is a little bit more chili.

Great location away from the busy check in area. Professional staff, very good tasting food, pricing on higher end.

We wanted to eat before our flight so with limited $ left to spend looked around. We looked at the menu and decided on scrambled egg and tomatoes we ordered 3 at $8 each.We were then asked if we wanted the wet wipe what was on the table which was chargeable we declined. We were then asked if we wanted something unrecognisable but was told it was very nice we declined.When finished we asked for the bill and was asked to pay $32.10 we said it should be $24 but the had added 10% service and 7% GST none of this was in the menu. The service was terrible all they were interested in was how much money the could get out of you.Pease avoi

I can't tell you exactly what we ate as my Singaporean friends choose the dishes, but there was a fried rice, noodles and vegetables - all delicious. Christina was our server and she regularly refilled our tea. The food arrived quickly as it wasn't very busy. This surprised me, as it was early Friday night. A refreshing change from the usual airport food. Worth becoming a member of you travel regularly.

Never expect an airport outlet to be so crowded. Looks like not only Travellers are here but nearby HDB residents as well. Food was delicious and portions just nice. We were served quickly. Expect to wait up to 30mins on a crowded day. Recommend a try

My family and I enjoy dinning at the Paradise chain of restaurants and have patronised many of them around the island. We decided to visit the Paradise Inn outlet at Changi Airport Terminal 1 over the National Day holiday, but, unfortunately, was quite disappointed. Unlike the other Paradise restaurants i.e. Dynasty, Canton, Parathai, etc, Paradise Inn in T1, we felt that the dishes were overpriced for the portion and quality of the food. Ironically, the cuisine offered is supposedly the old-fashion home-cooked dishes that grandma used to prepare back in the days. We were particularly disappointed with the $1.20 price tag for a small bowl of steamed rice good only for a few mouthful. To be fair to the chain, we love dinning at the Dynasty at T3, Canton at Bedok Mall, Katong I12 and AMK Hub as the service and quality and portion has never disappointed us. Also, the Paradise loyalty program makes it worthwhile for repeat visits. Perhaps the Paradise management need to review the consistency of the entire "Paradise Experience"

My partner has been raving about this place and we finally get to visit together last week while visiting Singapore. We are foodies and we usually hate when thinking about eating at the airport. If only every airport in the world could have one Paradise Inn!!The food here are of excellent flavour, generous portion and served quickly. The one that really impressed us is the pork belly buns. the pork belly was literally melting in your mouth and it taste just wonderful. My partner and I made a deal that everytime we're visiting Singapore this place would be our first meal and our last meal during the visit!M/

Delicious chinese cuisine, but slow in serving food although there were not too customers.
Free WiFi not available.

Good food on the way out of Singapore. Nice taste specially the Seafood was great. Had lounge access still ate outside the lounge as the food is not so good at the lounges.

This is the best Chinese restaurant in Changi Airport. You must try steamed minced pork, beef hor fun and plenty of choices which are really authentic Chinese styles. Prices may be a bit too high but it's worth to try.Food 4/5Restaurant 4/5Staff/Service 4/

Very nice food with great location. I got a Thai style marinated jellyfish and it was so delicious. The staff was nice but they didn't mention that the peanut wasn't a complimentary. It actually costed $1.80.The price is reasonable though, just about $15 including service charge

A friend wanted some Chinese food before leaving SG, so we ended up here. The portion of the dishes were big though we ordered small. Service was prompt and friendly. Food was good.We had the vegetables with 3 types of eggs, wasabi prawns, hot plate tofu, stir fry fish slice with onions, and their signature – 猪手米粉 Pork Vermicelli. We paid around $100 for 4 px, which I think is reasonable

Went to try Paradise Inn at T1 Changi Airport. Ordered Fish with Black Bean Sauce, Tofu with Thai Chilli, Fried Rice and Seafood Hor Fun. Taste was quite good.Service is a little slow ( and they did get our order mixed up but I assume it's a one time case ). Price is quite reasonable. Portion is quite sizable.

A welcome change from the usual dismal and greasy airport offerings, this restaurant offers good nourishing Chinese food, especially the herbal double-boiled soups and the good variety of healthy steamed dishes. There are some delicious naughty ones too! Its a proper sit-down restaurant which might not work if you are rushing to catch a plane, but well worth it if you've got the time

A nice place for a last meal in Singapore. Like many other places this is part of a chain of outlets and we chose it one the basis of our experience in the Gardens by the Bay outlet. This outlet is not so large and the variety of foodstuffs available is not as extensive. It doe however have the advantage of having front row seats for viewing the comings and goings of aircraft in that part of what is a very busy airport.  We went for chicken and Mao sandwiches to get us through till we were in the air. Surprisingly, they came toasted on a sort of fruit bread. Not being sure of what to expect we took tentative bits and to our surprise the flavor as wonderful and unexpected. It’s just a little thing but its very pleasing when you stumble upon something that worries you at first and then gives you a whole new taste experience.  Being at the airport the cost was more that it would have been expected to be outside but the service and friendliness of staff was up to the standard expected since our experience elsewher

If you're looking for a good meal, nice and peaceful atmosphere without the hassle of queueing to get your meal then this restaurant is your answer. Excellent chinese food served on nice cutlery. As for the service I notice some waiter/waitress are nice and polite yet some are nt

premise - nicely done up and very open in design. ample seats just steer clear of the peak periods.location - changi terminal 1 - car park and public transport aplenty!staff - good and fast. service with smiles that made the food taste that much bettercrowd - not only tourists but locals alike come here for a good meal! :) and it will be a good meal!food - tasty and affordable (to an extent)verdict - for tourists: come here for a nice meal before entering the departure hall where food varieties will be more catered for the grab and go crowd. for the locals: you guys know the standard of Paradise Inn, so need i say more? :
