Very friendly and attentive and flexible with the spice intensity. Some great novel dishes eg the fried dry vege entree. Good selection of local dishes (and western if you aren't feeling adventurous)
5
We have literally just finished our meal and it was fantastic. The food was very tasty and I'm glad I tried some local good other than western as recommended by the owner. I would love to come back to this restaurant. Highly recommended. :)

We had sweet and sour chicken with kampong rice. The chicken was good, but the rice was a bit bland-maybe this was because we only asked for it to be a little spicy. We ordered fried mixed vegetables which were quite tasteless. The draft Tiger beer was excellent and very cold in this small, family-run place
5
I stayed on Mackenzie Road and found Albert Court by accident on my second day. I am glad I did as it was such a pleasant place for both food and superb ambience. The owner was so pleasant and when I found he was a year younger we really chatted a lot about both our lives from after the War, as we were both too young to remember that, until today. I have visited Singapore a lot both during my Navy days and a few times since. I love 'real' Chinese food as opposed to what we get back in the UK and here it was perfect. In the end I dined here every night for the remaining 6 days of my holiday. The owner and his daughter and two grand daughters were so pleasant and they also indulged in my passion to eat with chopsticks and not as present day Singaporeans seem to do with a spoon and a fork!! My real favourite was the Sweet & sour Chicken with boiled rice
5
My wife and myself have slowly become a regular visitor here. It is such a lovely place, unpretentious, but great quality, and fantastic value for money. The owner is truly welcoming his guests and makes sure they feel at home. The quality is just outstanding. Last night, we had Singapore style Curry chicken cooked to our desired level of spiciness, beansprouts with anchovies (fresh and crunchy) and kampung fried rice. All very well prepared and delicious. Also, if you like some beer with it: a mug of beer is S$6.90, a jug S$20.90, which is super cheap by any Singapore standard. And last but not least: it is at Albert Court, a bit hidden, but it is a very nice place to sit and chat and relax while eating
5
a small restaurant located just outside Village Hotel Albert Court which offers local & western food. itâ€™s was a surprise move by the owner who offered me a small plate of peanuts while my food is being cooked & even ask about the level of spicyness of my food which I ordered. will come back again definitely.
5
Was greeted and served by Leo personally, a homegrown Singaporean who runs this charming family establishment where his daughters and nieces do the cooking. Food was outstanding, wide variety of local dishes complete with recommendations, and amazing value for money. Cute outdoor venue in a hotel courtyard. Will surely be back for years to come! Thanks Leo for such a personal and memorable experienc
5
You will certainly not have to look far for good food in Singapore but if you are anywhere near Albert Court (just south of Little India) you won't do better for really authentic local food than Leo Cafe and Restaurant. Vicki does the cooking and dad deals with the customers.Everything freshly cooked to order so sit back and enjoy the quaint little courtyard atmosphere with a nice glass of wine or cold beer.Don't be put off by the small fronted cafe as my wife and I had a range of dishes to share and each was absolutely amazing. They also do a range of European dishes but do yourself a favour and go for the local cuisine
5
About a week ago we settled in Singapore for a couple of nights. There were some restaurants in the hotel's square. Intuition guided we choose LEO restaurant, and we made the right choice. The man who served us was kind and friendly. We really felt welcome there. And our meal was melting in the mouth. I had sweet and sour chicken, and my partner chooses lamb chops. I have never enjoyed such food, very high quality, so tasty that I still feel the taste. After a meal, the man said that his daughter was preparing food. We are very happy about our choice and would like to thank you for the nice experience. I highly recommend this restaurant
5
After having a lovely dinner and drinks here this evening, I just wanted to write a review to say we thought this place was great, our food of Pepper prawns and vegetable noodles were really nice, a good portion size and at a great price. The restaurant also has the most friendly staff especially Vicki Leo the owner. If we get chance before we leave Singapore we will definitely go back.Thank you
5
Incredible food, serves all day from lunch. Great selection of dishes on menu, both Asian and western. Large selection of drinks too
5
Visited twice while staying at the Village Albert Court Hotel recently. Delicious food and lovely, friendly owners. Definitely recommend a visit.
5
Had our family CNY lunch at Leo Cafe yesterday. Totally enjoyed the curry chicken. Tasted really good. Must try the prawns also. Very tasty. ;) Will definitely go back there again. ;)
5
We were staying at Village Albert Court Hotel, we chose Leo CafÃ© because is wasn't serving Indian, we wanted to try the local food.What a pleasant surprise, Leo is a charming Gentleman, he made us very welcome.The food was freshly cooked, while we waited, we enjoyed very ice cold Tiger Beer.Leo's daughter is the Chief, his niece is the waitress.The whole dining experience was 10 out of 10, service, hospitality and Food!
4
We ate here 3 nights running. First night I had the spicy prawns. This was very nice with just the right portion size. The second night I had the curry chicken. Whilst it was nice, it was a bit of a let down after the prawns of the night before. My partner and our companions also mentioned the meals were ok but not of the standard of the night before.The 3rd night I had the spicy chicken and asked for it to be extra hot as being a white tourist, I find most places tend to give me mild to medium spicy when I ask for hot.My extra hot spicy chicken came somewhere just over hot though it was enough to give a slight tingle to the lips. As for the taste..... it was Fantastic! Vicki Leo (the owner's daughter and our chef for the night) congratulations on a fantastic meal. Maybe you should make this your signature meal??? Mr Leo, you can be very proud of your restaurant, customer service your chef (daughter
5
If you like eating at a true family run place who serve fresh cooked meals this is the place for you. Father, daughter and niece make for a real personal style of service, along with a bunch of interesting locals. You get the best of all worlds, good food, good service, good prices and good company chatting to friendly locals. Unfortunately for us we only discovered Leo's a few days before returning home to New Zealand when we were tempted in by Vicki's dad, a decision we didn't regret. Having enjoyed our meal so much we came back again the following night and it was just as enjoyable a visit, sadly we left the day after that. If you enjoy good, straight from the pan kind of cooking you'll not regret dropping in for a meal or snack along with a glass of cold Tiger beer - heaven! Can't wait for our next visit to Singapore to sample the food again
5
I stayed nearby and ended up eating here at least once a day! Leo is absolutely charming, very gentle and caring and makes you feel at home! All the staff are very friendly. The chilli crab looked delicious although I didn't try it. The prawn korma, vegetable stir fry and chilli calamari were my favourite dishes. Good mix of local and western food so all diners will be happy here! Alcohol at a good price for Singapore. Thank you Leo!
5
I am sorry I chose our final night to eat here as I would have liked to eat here again. Delicious food and delightful service. I did not expect such a good restaurant on the door step of the hotel - Village Albert Court. The menu is wide ranging from local to western - but I suggest you go with the recommendations - they are fabulous. We will return.
5
After reading previous comments we decided to eat here - twice!!!! Food is Asian or Western. They accommodate all tastes and ask you how spicy, or not, you want your food. Prices are very cheap but quality good. [12 Singapore dollars for chicken fried rice.] Location very pleasant - a nice palm tree lined square. Leo's is a tiny outdoor place but even in the rain the parasol keeps you dry. Owners amazing, friendly people. Can't recommend it highly enough
5
What a lovely restaurant. Friendly staff coupled with excellent cooking ...All at very good price....What more could you want. It already has TripAdvisor excellence award, which it deserves. Just across from our hotel....The superb Village Hotel Albert Court. One of their customers was very helpful. My wife had an omelette beautifully cooked, and I chose the seafood spaghetti, with succulent prawns,scallops,crab sticks and fish + squid. Portion sizes were perfect for us as we had a portion of chips with the meal. A bowl of salted peanuts was provided while the meal was freshly cooked. The Tiger beer and pineapple juice came quickly,. An excellent meal
5
Just got back from a meal at Leo's, I had Seafood Noodles which was fabulous. Leo is a nice guy and serves great food and beer at a good price. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!
5
We had numeral dishes. Unforgettable mutton curry and sweet n spicy prawn.
Mutton well braised to perfect tenderness, empowering spice to harmonize entire dish. Suggest for large groups. Fantastic consistency. Came back most of the time never fail to satisfy.
5
We were quite tired after an intercontinental flight when we sat down at Leo’s.
The staff were very supportive in suggesting dishes and adapting them slightly for our children's taste.
We especially loved the prawns.
5
No trip to singapore would be complete without a visit to this awesome little spot, the food is fantastic and generously proportioned and the owner Leo is such a genuinely kind man. Highly recommend Leo's
3
After going thru TripAdvisor ratings we decided to have dinner here and try something local other than regular Indian meals. But what we got couldn't satisfy our taste buds. We realized our mistake of limiting chef creativity by our pure veg demand.
5
We ate at this restaurant, the first day we got to Singapore as we were very tired and we noticed that this place had a TripAdvisor C of E. They were proudly flying their C of E flag. It was right across from our hotel.The service was excellent and they had many menu choices. We went with the Western choices and I had the Dory (fish) and my friend had the Sirloin steak. These came with potato wedges and steamed vegetables. The food was served sizzling hot on an iron plate and was cooked perfectly. The pricing was very reasonable.The seating of this restaurant is located outside so it is not air-conditioned, and it is very hot in Singapore. So you do not need to bring a sweater!We agree with the TripAdvisor C of E and would recommend eating here
4
After arriving and checking into the Village Albert Court Hotel, we had a light dinner at Leo CafÃ© & Restaurant. The service was outstanding and the meal was with us within 10-15 minutes, it was piping hot and delicious.We had a few drinks after our meal and they were very reasonably priced and a bit on the strong side, no watering down of spirits here.Totally recommend this restaurant
5
Back to Leo Cafe after a long absence. The authentic taste still lingers! All time favourite, "Signature Kampong Fried Rice". The shallots, spiciness, mixed with the fragrance from the chicken gets me going. Ended up finish the whole plate. Had an enjoyable and cozy evening with friends and beer! An excellent place to chill out!
5
Leo provides high quality food with a smile and a good price. The service is fantastic and the food even better. The only reason the costs are good is the proximity to the cbd. Otherwise Leo would be justified in charging more. It is only a 10min commute from the cbd including walking time so it's easy to get there and well worth it.Leo serves many types of Asian food. Our group was in the mood for Indian that night and Leo didn't disappoint. It was as good as any we have had. But they do traditional Singaporean food, as well as some others such as Thai and Malaysian. If I had a chance to return I would be trying the chilli crab this time, on Leo's advice.The photos are of my wife with our daughter and armed with one Singapore Slipper, a traditional cocktail that is nice and you need to try at least once. But they are strong, be warned. And yes, that's Leo joining in the fun Leo's is great, well worth a visi
4
The place is so close from my hotel. The area is vintage feel like dinner in 60's. Even the lamp decoration in the tree palm so unsure but still OK. The food is recommended especially for SEA taste. The price is nice also.Sorry I just can upload empty plate coz I'm very hungry and forget to take a picture in advance. LOL...!!Keep it up uncle and thanks for your services.
5
Greatest food ever. Right in Albert Court, great service from both the owner and his staff. Try the PrawnGambero and the Malaysian Beef. It's outdoors, umbrellas to protect you from the sun and a great vibe
4
I had the oxtail Soup, then the Dory served on a hot plate. All served in a great atmosphere, lots of hustle & bustle. Leo was always there, helping with photos and the like.
4
Nice little place picked because of good rating on trip advisor. Had the pepper beef which had the rice amount of heat.. Most non seafood dishes around sgd 20. Good fast service and very friendly owner who doesn't mind a chat with his customers.
4
Enigmatic because when ur in front of a small shop with 10 sitting table and chair and an old man coming near you and softly saying you are in front of best Singapore cafe restaurant believe me he is not joking. Service is outstanding and so is his kindness. A family of 3 with an infant giggling and moving around and host is making all effort to make it comfortable is not a easy thing to see in today's world. It's more than a restaurant. Highly recommended for food as well. As chicken dishes were awesom
4
This average priced cafe certainly does not have average food. The most accommodating Leo ensured that our children were happy with the level of chilli, ensuring that they were able to sample some delicious curries rather than resorting to a Western menu choice. We had the Beef Opur and the Mutton Curry and both were flavoursome and fresh. We also had pineapple fried rice. The fresh pineapple has a lovely zing! The service was quick considering it was cooked to order. The water glasses were attentively refilled and enquiries made as to our satisfaction with the meal ( in my opinion, a hallmark of good service and an indicator of true interest in customer happiness). Leo slipped the kids a few sneaky chocolates after their meal! What a gem! We will return despite vowing to " not eat in the same place twice"
5
LEO , the owner ,is there to greet and seat you. His daughter, Vicki, is the chef. I had the best fried rice I have had in Singapore at Leo's. The sweet and sour chicken, by which I judge chinese cuisine the world over, is absolutely great here. Second only to London's china town, as I told Leo
5
We ate here two nights as it was so good and very handy to our hotel. The food and especially the spice cooked to order. It was really tasty and full of quality meat etc. Leo was a lovely guy to chat to as well. Def recommend
5
We had a vegetarian food and it was awesome, my wife does not eat non veg and Leo modified the dish to cater to her requirements, one of the best meals i have tasted. The owner Leo himself looks after the guests and his daughter Vicky is the chef, who chose to become a chef and was helped by her dad Leo to setup the restaurant. They made me feel completely at home, not a restaurant!!! Leo himself joined us at the table and we had a wonderful conversation. It was the last day of my trip with my wife and unfortunately could not sample more of their hospitality. i will definitely visit Leo's next time i am in Singapore and would highly recommend them to anyone in the vicinity of Albert Street. Thanks Leo for adding a highlight to my trip and Vicky, you cook with passion. Keep it up and see you next time!! Cheers..
5
I come here in the month of January if I am not wrong. The food here is great cooked by Vicky. Friendly service they will treat all of their guest like welcoming at their own home. The salmon steak is also great I would recommend this for the tourists out there who loves Asian food. Prices are reasonable so what are you waiting for come and have a meal there
3
We persuaded our friends to eat at this restaurant based on its previous reviews on trip advisor. The owner greeted us upon looking at the menu, and was pleasant throughout. In terms of the food, between the four of us, we had a couple of starters, a few rice dishes and four hot plates/curries.We were asked how spicy we wanted each dish, so that it could be suited to our taste which was a positive for my fellow diners. The chilli chicken dish that I had was fairly spicy, and flavoursome. The lack of accompanying starters/appetizers, especially compared to the neighboring restaurants was a bit of a disappointment. And some of the meat served to one of the party wasn't lean enough to eat, and the prawns served didn't compare to local competitors. Overall it was a fair meal, at around an average price. The restaurant itself is much smaller than its neighbours, and on the night we visited there were only three other diners, whereas the larger restaurants were much busier
4
We liked Leo's. He was friendly & his menu had slighlty more variety than the hotel. He had run out of chicken the first time we tried him but generally there was no problem and his food was good.
4
Good food for reasonable price. The restaurant is actually nicer than it looks in the pictures: it is in a nice cul de sac with no cars and tiny lights hanging around palm trees. Tables are in the open. Sorry, I did not take pictures...
5
Leo Cafe offers a good varied menu, covering Asian as well as some Western dishes. My kids loved the fish 'n chips. We went for Asian food as well. The Tom Yum seafood soup was great, as were the noodles, Singapore style.
5
Visit again after 3 years, excellent service, hospitality & food as usual, love this place a real must for flavour and value.
5
This is the second time we have been to Leo's. When in Singapore we always pay a visit. The food is fresh and tasty and you are made to feel very welcome. Hope to be back in a few years time. Thanks Mr Leo.
5
Had a very nice meal ,good service we had early dinner. Excellent choice of dishes. Perfectly cooked
5
We had excellent food expirience dinning at Leo Restaurant & Caffe. Chineese food cooked with love and served in such a beautiful manners even late at night. The restaurant is small but you feel so relaxed in the Albert Court area.Thans to Leo and his lovely family team including the great master cheef VickiWill definitely come back to dinne in this restaurant with so naturla things in it.Sead& AmiraMelbourn
5
Leo told us that if we walked past we would be making a mistake. He was right! There are several small eating places together We stopped and had a lovely meal cooked by his daughter who came out and asked us how much spice would suit our taste. Very pleasant atmosphere and great service. We will certainly go again next time we are in Singapore. Possibly not easy to find unless you are staying at Albert Court or Parc Sovereign hotel, but worth looking for and much nicer to eat there than in a hotel
5
Excellant Chilli Crab, Beehoon, Kapong Rice sweet and Sour and European food. Lovely setting beneath palm trees with smooth, efficient friendly Service. Congratulations to the Cook VICKI and to her father LEO and everyone that makes this place every time, one great place to go to eat for all the family
5
The restaurant is situated within the colonial Albert Court setting and mine host is Leo a charming and interesting man. In his kitchen is a superb chef Vicki who prepares incredibly tasty fusion Chinese food prepared to your individual taste so chilli prawns or peppered beef can either blow your head off or be subtly spiced, there is a good selection of dishes to suit all tastes. The food doesn't come laced with MSG either, this lady doesn't need to use flavour enhancers! I had the good fortune to dine there twice recently whilst staying at the Village hotel just next door. Not to be missed
5
I really would not know how to make a curry any better. It has been just perfect.
I wish we had Leo in my home town. He was extremely friendly, so was the chef!
5
Amazing place for food and chillax session. The prawns in particular were amazing. The sweetness of every bite is simply unforgettable. And the best part, it's fully shelled. Talk about considerate. ;)
Everyone must go try someday... ;)
5
Dropped by with my family over Chinese New Year and so glad we did because the food was fantastic and the service was great! Really enjoyed the good atmosphere here, the area is accessible and very clean! Double thumbs up, highly recommended!
3
Drinks are great, prices are very reasonable.
Food is not consistent.
Asian dish (lamb) was very good.
Western (steak) was full of ligament / not edible at all.
Unlikely to come again for food.
5
Had a nice relaxing meal here on our last night in Singapore. Very friendly owner in Leo. Family run. Good honest food. Their recommendations were great. Excellent value for money.
1
I feel really bad but I have to be honest and I would never ever go back unless I needed a drink. I didn't like the food.
2
Tried their fish and chips and lamb chop but to my dismay, both were terrible. The fish tasted funny and had a sour tinge to it (definitely did not come from the lemon) while the lamb chops were just outright poor. I could have paid half the price at a food court/hawker centre's western stall and gotten better standards. To be fair, their service was excellent and I strongly believe their other stuff would have been great (as per other reviews) but PLEASE avoid their western.
4
I had been meaning to try the food here on a previous visit ti Singapore. My last visit i made the effort.It was a quiet night when i stopped by so i had a chance to cg at with the owner (Leo) a very likable person (as are most Singaporeans ) i had a prawn dish which was nice and spicy,I don't think the drinks are that cheap but overall i would recommend eating here located in a quiet precinct ps there is a boutique bar next door ( Hospoda) which sells nice beers
5
We choose this restaurant on the off chance our first night. The food was cooked to order and Leo asked how much spice we wanted in our dish to suite our individual taste. The food arrived really quickly and was amazing. I ordered an a curry that's was so delicious we returned for dinner again on our second night.
5
We found this place on TripAdvisor and it lived up to the reviews; it is situated in a quiet square on the edge of Little India. Leo served us and the food was brilliant!Expecting a quiet night only his daughter was in the kitchen but she produced 10 dishes and each was outstanding. We were there a couple of hours and had a great time.The prices are good - both for food and drink. We wanted a good Chinese meal and we found it here. I would definitely come back; don't be put off by the small size of the place
4
A warm and cosy little café to unwind after a day full of sightseeing. We were staying in the nearby Albert Court hotel and this place was just perfect....Good food, ambience and service ....
4
Freshly cooked food, cool beers, very welcoming and attentive staff, nice ambiance. Surely will be back and recommend to our family and friends!
5
As above. Can't say more. Great food, great service and Leo himself is a great host! Well worth the visit!
4
we stop here because they must look for shelter, clean restaurant and very impressive, we've called cafe to enjoy and watch the rain. Cafe where fragrant, but not bold like cafe Mexico, perhaps we used to drink more South American coffee, nice seating, Cheap
4
The place is comfortable, the food is good, the service is good and the price is quite cheap.I will go back to enjoy Indonesian oxtail soup.
5
This was the best meal we had in Singapore! Leo was a lovely man and his daughter cooked us a delicious dinner! With only her in the kitchen and 8 mouths to feed she still managed to cook an absolutely amazing Chinese feast for us. The restaurant is situated in a cute little square off from the main road (definitely a hidden gem!) and has an outdoor seating area to enjoy the ambience of the square. The food and drink is very reasonably priced (the cheapest and nicest we found in Singapore) and the service fantastic - Leo is awesome. Couldn't recommend this place more - a small, family run business that does delicious authentic food. Absolutely worth a visit
5
We came as a family of 6 adults and our Aunt and Uncle after seeing the reviews on trip advisor. We certainly weren't disappointed!Leo greeted us with a friendly smile, he explained that his daughter was cooking all the dishes from scratch so the food would come at different times. The food was exceptional! It tasted delicious and there was lots of variety, especially for the vegetarians amongst us. The location was great, just off a busy road in Little India where you'd stumble across it by accident if you're lucky! All 8 of us had a great meal and there was nothing left by the end! The drinks were very reasonably priced (by Singapre standards) and we'd all definitely visit again should we be back on Singapore! Thank you Leo and your lovely daughter! Best wishes for the future

We are British travellers. We visited Singapore on a budget and set out minds on eating mainly in hawker centre's during our stay, just to remain in budget. You do find though after a time you do wish to have a slightly more refined experience, not that hawker centre's are bad in any way. We were staying at Parc Sovereign Albert Street which is just next door. One afternoon we both decided to try and find a good quality but budget-friendly establishment and settled on Chinese cuisine. I logged onto TripAdvisor and filtered my search to look for only Chinese restaurant's in Singapore. The first option that came up was Leo's and I couldn't believe my luck when I realised it was literally just metres away in Albert Court, which is a lively colonial style setting. A little square that most people just use as a thoroughfare, but it has a lovely ambience. We browsed the menu without any hassle from the staff and as soon as we made up our minds to sit outside we were quickly shown to a table. Staff were lovely and attentive, orders taken and delivered promptly. Food was very tasty and hot. Being westerners our palette is not quite up to true Asian standards, but this food was just right for us. I ordered chicken noodles, which was a fair portion and very filling. It is a lovely bistro type venue, and to sit outside in the evening in this small square you can really believe you are miles away from the bustling city of Singapore. I would definitely recommend it for a visit. The bill was in line with prices in the UK for a sit down Chinese restaurant, however drinks in Singapore do have a tendency to increase the bill, that seems par for the course and in no way reflects badly on Cafe Leo.
5
The service was very good and the food was excellent, we enjoyed it so much we went back again on the following day! The prices were reasonable, and it was pleasantly cool eating outside, and the atmosphere was very relaxed. We would definitely recommend Leo's to anyone visiting Singapore
5
A place where the food is well taken care of with meticulous detail and care.The consistency in the flavour and quality of food, coupled with the relaxing atmosphere that Leo Cafe & Restaurant is nestled in, creates a unique charm that is not easily found elsewhere. If you fancy a great time of drinks and food with your family of friends, but would like to escape the maddening crowd at the usual places, this is a good place to visit :
5
great little restaurant fabulous food and staff
have a murgh curry exceptional and top it off
for the ladies a Singapore sling for $15 and a nice cold beer
great value for food and drink
5
My husband and I have lived in the area now for 2 years and Leo's remains one of our local favourites.
Food and service great, a firm favourite with us and our families when they visit.
5
A nice little cafe/restaurant in a peaceful setting. The food was good and the service very friendly. We have been going there since 2005 every time we visit Singapore and are happy to recommend it.
5
Simply outstanding service, food and value. Lovely family hosts and super friendly. Great little restaurant. Signature dishes are delightful with very nice environs.
5
Fantastic! Lovely little family run restaurant. Great quality seafood; wide variety of Asian n Western food. Nice outdoor seating in the courtyard. Highly recommended.
5
Excellent food quality and you will also get very useful advice from the staff - very helpful and honest
5
A relaxing inviting place to eat.
Staff were helpful with guidance on the menu and the service was prompt.
Will be back.
4
Lovely very lovely food, loved the food easy on your stomach & pocket and loved the variety of cuisines .
5
Excellent food Fantastic service. Definitely be back for more. This is a great restaurant. Had a great time there. The food here was very delicious and fresh, we really enjoyed ourself and the meal so much. Staff was very friendly and helpful, They treat us with great hospitality. We will be returning again
5
Wonderful service and great food.I ate here twice during by stay and throughly enjoyed the Anchovy fried rice and the tenderest lamb chop I have ever eaten.I must make special mention of the older gentleman who is both greeter and server. Ask his advice on the food and you won't be disappointed
5
Service was wonderful and the meals were very authentic and fresh. There is a great range and the staff are very happy to adjust to personal taste. I would definitely recommend.
4
Nicely located in the Courtside of Village Albert Court Hotel, the food was quite good and the service great. I found the dishes a little expensive for the amount of food served, though. Worth trying!
5
For 21 Singapore dollars you can buy a carafe of draught Tiger beer, the local foods are great and very reasonable.
4
We went to this Cafe on our last night. Whatever we ordered tasted good. wish we had tried the place sooner.
5
We made a point of visiting Leo cafe again during our second trip to Singapore as we ate some of the most delicious food we have ever tasted. Full of favour and lots of choice. You can tell the food is freshly prepared and we felt confident Vicky understood and catered for coeliac requirements (gluten free). We felt welcomed to Leo cafe and received nothing but friendly warm service. We look forward to going again one day in the future and would advise anyone visiting Singapore to make a trip down to Leo cafe. They also do a nicer Singapore sling than Raffles Hotel at half the price!!!!!!!!!!!
4
I made my second visit to Leo on my second trip to Singapore. As before, I found it to be a friendly place with personal service, good food, and reasonable prices. The lamb dish is particularly recommended. It'll continue to be a regular stop for me
5
we wanted a meal near our hotel and decided to use Leo's. As I have a several allergies he reassured me that as the meals were made to order that he could oblige me. True to his word and as a bonus the meal was excellent and at a very reasonable cost. We then decided to use Leo's for our stay and were not disappointed. On one occasion we were chatting to folks on the next table and they too were very impressed with the quality of the meals. The cafe is in a relaxed courtyard area seating outside, great for people watching. Thank you Leo and your tea
4
What a great find and only yards from our hotel.A wide range of local and international dishes at very reasonable prices, and most imprtantly very good quality. A very attentive host who cares about his customers even to the point of providing delicious bananas "from his own garden!".I would thoroughly recommend this resaurant to locals and visitors alike
5
Leo cafe and restaurant is just outside the front door of my hotel. It might look fairly simple but don't be deceived- the service from the owner and his daughter was friendly but never intruding. I started with tomato soup which was light but packed with flavor. Then I had the blackened beef which was exceptional with just the right amount of spices. The meat was tender and delicious. I'm only in Singapore for 2 nights but will probably come back here tomorrow. It was that good. Always nice to feel that you have discovered a little gem in a foreign city.
5
I've visited so many restaurants in Singapore but one that consistently stands out is this cafÃ©. The food is so delicious with a wide variety to choose from- Western to Asian. We especially love the wings, black pepper beef, oxtail soup, and the pineapple fried rice. The owner and waiters are so kind and really give you a great experience. There's no service charged included in the bill, so if you have a great experience make sure you show your appreciation
5
Awesome food coupled with a relaxing and cosy ambience. Great place to hang out for casual meet-ups with friends and family :)
5
Fantastic! Great quality seafood; we had garlic prawns and black pepper prawns and they were massive and cooked to perfection. Highly recommended
5
I ate lunch and dinnert on this restaurent and food was really testy and staffs are friendly .Off course great location near MRT And Little India .
5
It was very close to our accommodation and good honest food. We had the feeling that they didn't cope well with to many tables.
4
Ambience and the staff was good, extensive menu, little pricey, but quality of the food compensates it,
4
Lovely little family run restaurant in the Albert Street close to our Hotel. İbis Bencoolen. Wonderful Asian meals and friendly service..The Chinese fried calamari, seafood fried noodle, and the stir fry chicken noodle was delicious İt was nice to be sitting outside in the evening and watching people while passing. Price was reasonable, and the setting in the courtyard was terrifi

Loved the food here at Leo's. We'd been meaning to try this place out for some time, on our past visit, and ran out of time. We had great service from the proprietor and his family. The food was second to none - thoroughly delicious and reasonably priced. Pay a visit to Leo's - you certainly won't be disappointed!
5
I've been staying in Singapore since Beginning of November and eat out most evenings and because of the friendly helpful father and daughter team that run this eloquent restaurant serving authentic food which is not only a delight to eat but excellent value, I have returned to eat here on many an evening and can recommend to anyone to give it a go.

We wanted to "go chinese", for our 1st night in S.pore. Leo's was ranked way up there, and it was only a very short walk from our hotel. At first I was a little sceptical! - nothing very much to see! Only outdoor seating, but that doesnt matter its S.pore! There was lots of rain, but we were well covered by large umberellas. Leo, the boss and his crew did a fantastic job. He helped us with our order, but didnt just tell us to order EVERYTHING! - Some bosses do that! The food was just fantastic, fresh and tasty. We had planned to visit as many eating places as possible whilst in S.pore. We have to change our plans now, as we MUST go back there for more

Recently we are back to this cozy nice bistro restaurant for dinner and chill-out. The service is as good and friendly, the food is as awesome. This time, we tried the chicken chop and chilli squid which are tasty. It's a great chill-out place for food and drinks
4
This is a nice outdoor restaurant in a pleasant courtyard setting. The food was well priced, with sensible portions and the beer was cold. I dined there twice and enjoyed both meals. The curried prawns are recommended.
5
👀👀no further for excellent food and service along with some 🐯🍺🍺🍺🍺.
The hostess and Chef is Miss Vicki, along with her Dad Leo who is a great Character.
we ate here every night as the Selection was just as our TITLE.👍👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

I couldn't fault the service or the fantastic food. I was so lucky to find this fantastic family run restaurant, couldn't ask for more.
5
had one of the most delicious dinners, at fabulous prices in Singapore. White cloth napkins, outside seating,cold beer, Aussie red wine all top notch! Steak came on a sizzle plate with steak fries and fresh broccoli, cauliflower, and long beans!! Really more than I expected for the price. The spaghetti with button mushrooms in tomato sauce was super yummy too! If you are near little India you must try this place!

For some reason this restaurant had top reviews with Trip Advisor and it was extremely disappointing. It was very standard Chinese food, uninteresting, in an uninteresting setting, part of a small outdoor mall/food court with adjacent restaurants playing loud radio. How this place had high ratings I have no idea. Seems like fraud
3
I'm puzzled by the ecstatic reviews of this cafe. I ordered a Chinese meal, which was good but nothing special. There was no crush of folks waiting for tables, either.The pluses were low cost, nicely portioned servings (not too large), and friendly management. Also, it is part of the shop/pub/restaurant complex adjacent to the very nice Village Albert Court Hotel and Park Sovereign Hotel. Dining outdoors is the way to go. The large fan keeps air circulating, and the evening temperatures were very pleasant
5
Lovely little Resturant in the Albert Street courtyard. Huge food selection which included both Asian and western meal choices. As my wife and I decided to share the staff were wonderfully helpful making suggestions of what meals went with others. Service was first class. Food tasted great and it was nice to be sitting outside in the evening "people watching" as we enjoyed our meal. Highly recommended
4
Wanted 2 go somewhere near our hotel at Albert Court as it was raining. My fish dish was tasty but could have been accompanied by a lemon or fish sauce, not a selection of gravies! My husband 'said his steak was a bit gristly, and it was red in the Centre although it was supposed to be well done.I had a bourbon which tasted very watered down, even with ice in it.For dessert, only 2 flavors of ice cream and a baNana sundae offered, with one scoop of ordered ice cream served in a wineven glass.on the plus side, no added service tax or charges
2
When we arrived here, we had to check the name and location to be sure it was the same place as indicated in the glowing reviews. Its not really a restaurant, at most a cafÃ© with 5-6 tables outside in a little lane with bars and other cafes. We went ahead and gave it a try, and found the food to be mediocre at best. Pepper beef was ok, everything else was very bland and oily. Tiny glass of wine had obviously come from a bottle that had been open for many days. No sign at all of the cocktails that one reviewer reports. While we ate, we were treated to the sounds from the bar a few meters away that was broadcasting a local radio station that was mostly talking, little music. Service was kind, but could not make up for everything else that was lacking. Only one other diner, although several people just drinking beer. This place is like countless others, and does not belong anywhere in the top 500. Is it curious that many of the most positive reviewers have only posted 1 review? So unlucky that we wasted one of our two nights out in Singapore
4
The food is good, the location is quiet and nice, a good location to sit outside and not be bothered by trafic.The person that served my was the father of the owner. He was friendly.I went twice to this restaurant while staying in the albert court hotel
5
Very friendly proprietor and staff. Wonderful Asian meals, fast and friendly service. Outdoor seating under the stars and lights. Close to many tourist attractions. A great dining experience, have been going there for about 4 years on our visits to Singapore. Highly recommended
5
An excellent meal! Will come back. The staff and owner were very helpful and friendly. The food absolutely delicious and we strongly recommend eating here.
4
Just been once during stay in Albert Village court Hotel that is just a few meters beside.
Friendly staff, average - to good Food with quick service.
Pricewise OK
4
The choice of food is good - taste no so spice but mild and fresh. the owner is always good for a beer and his daugther always has a smile for you when you come and tears when you leave.
5
I have just returned to Singapore And visited Leo Cafe again. It is still of the very high standard as it was before. Excellent food and service. Highly recommended.
5
Been round malaysia for our honeymoon last few days in singapore!! Checked trip advisor for chinese food leos popped up in top 20 should be in top 10 beautful food.. Would recommend to any1!!!!!
5
reasonable price for food & drink. food recommendation - calamari, black pepper tender beef slice and garlic prawn with a bottle of erdinger beer..
5
Excellent food,excellent staff and great atmosphere.I dined here on 9 evenings and thoroughly enjoyed the food.The restaurant caters for all tastes with an extensive menu.Well done & keep up the great food quality.Try the oxtail soup,the broccoli seafood,or the grilled bream - all so yum
5
My hub and I first went to this tiny restaurant because was close to our hotel. The TA reviews were very good so why not. What a nice surprise! The food was delicious with a touch of homemade taste, fresh ingredients and big smiles from the owner Leo and his crew. His daughter is the chef and commands the kitchen helped by her cousins and father. The menu is extensive and offers Chinese, Asian and Western fare. But we tried only the Asian and Chinese dishes all of them mouthwatering and really tasteful. We've been to Leo's many times and our favorite dishes were the Chinese fried calamari and the stir fry chicken noodle. Very good also was the Indonesian curry chicken, similar in taste to the Thai green curry only with different ingredients. The inconvenience is that the restaurant is so tiny that there is no inside seating, therefore no AC. In Singapore might be a big set back for this restaurant. However the food and service compensate for the lack of AC and Leo has a few fans around to make your meal enjoyable. Also the nice courtyard on Albert street adds charm to the setting. And last the prices are very reasonable considering the multitude of expensive restaurants in Singapore. Go and enjoy
5
Been to this restaurant through recommendations from a friend working nearby.Have been coming back for their seafood fried noodle, fish and chips, signature nasi goreng and chilli sotong.The food comes in pretty good portion and affordable prices.Atmosphere is cosy if you are looking for a place to wind down after a long day at work. Down it with a few Erdinger or Heneiken after meal and making merry with friends or family.Open till 12midnight thus good place for dinner and supper too. Parking can be found at basement carpark of Albert Court Hotel.Would strongly recommend this place.Price : Spend $80+ for 3 pax including 4 bottles of beer
4
On the cheaper side of eats in Singapore.
Very tasty no frills food and friendly owners and staff.
The sliced beef dish is a standout!
5
A place where u can relax with nice food n can chill out after dinner. Great place for family or frenz gathering. Must try garlic prawn, seafood kailan n crab 😄
5
Good service and food. Nice outdoor seating good for chilling out. Recommend Calamari to all is tasty. Best location for good relaxing with friends. Reasonable price.
5
Once again Leo Cafe & Restaurant did it again. Thank you Leo Cafe & Restaurant for providing good service to my family when we are back in Singapore. All should try their Chilli Crab.
5
Food there is nice. Service is good and fast. A good place to relax and enjoy your food. Nice place to meet up with friends and have a good chill up.
3
I've been here a few times and the service is good and the food is alright. However, I think the prices are a bit expensive for similar choices in the area.
4
I stayed at the Albert Court Hotel for a week and ate at Leo's for at least 50% of the time. It basically had everything I needed: tasty, fresh, unpretentious food; fast service; and extremely friendly and helpful people. On my last night I asked for a custom-made dish which was a kind of combination of two other dishes, and not only was it no problem, it tasted exactly the way I wanted it to taste...
5
My second visit to this restaurant at Albert Court with company of 4. Orders were taken promptly by their friendly staff. Had chilli crabs, black pepper beef, broccoli with scallop and garlic prawn served with rice for a price of $200+. Good tasty food which was value for money. A place highly recommended for good food
5
This little Restaurant is right outside the Albert Court Hotel and what a find. We were outside looking at the menu when a young lady came out and spoke to us. We had a chat about the food and found out what time they would be open. Her name was Vicki and she was so nice we went back later for dinner. We were not disappointed it was FANTASTIC. and we were made to feel very special. The meal was Fab and service so good we went back the next night(we were only two night's in Singapore) if we had stayed longer we would have gone back time & time again.Thank you Vicki for making our stay and our food so lovely
5
Recently stayed in Albert St and ate at this lovely alfresco cafe/restaurant four timesHave to say one of the best meals we had in Singapore, great service from Vicki Leo the owner and very moderately priced.With a large group also eating there the service was so quick and again the coldest beer
5
This was not my first visit and defenly not my last visit. The service, food and environment is perfect. I tryed the chili crap and it was great.
5
Brilliant place to go and eat and enjoy the atmosphere! The cocktails are amazing and freshly made, the food is fresh, tasty and filling for a very reasonable price. Lovely atmosphere and worth a visit, will return every time I go to Singapore.
5
It gets so many thing right , provided you don't want to eat in somewhere that looks very expensive and in top if a tower or in a soulless mall.
If you want to eat great food in an unpretentious place go here !
5
In the courtyard near the Albert Court Hotel this restaurant serves, as the sign says, Eastern and Western delights. If you or one of your party are having rice overload then go here for a good western chicken and vege meal or fish and chips. Not as cheap as hawker centres but still quite reasonable. Short walk from Little India MRT station
5
We first went to Leos about 4 years ago when we stayed at the hotel in Albert court, and found the food & service excellent. On returning to Singapore this year we decided to travel across the city from where we were staying to see if it was still there, we were not disappointed. The food & service were excellent again. It was so good we travelled across to eat there every night of our stay and thoroughly enjoyed every meal we had ther
3
Visited on Saturday 25. The cafe is set around a courtyard with other restaurants - outside - and is quite pleasant. We went there purely because if Trip Advisor reviews.The staff were extremely hospitable, charming. The dishes we had were uninspiring - and we wondered whether there was another Leo cafe !Expensive for what we had - wold not return
4
My lovely husband and I visited this restaurant on our last night in Singapore. Drawn there by the excellent reviews on TA. the setting was really nice all lit up with fairy lights. The service was friendly and efficient. We shared beef in black pepper and ginger and a vegetables dish. Plus boiled rice. The meal was pleasant but nothing to write home about. We had eaten better and cheaper in Singapore but if you are looking for an adequate meal, set outside, in nice quiet surroundings, then this will suit just fine.
4
We were told that trying Chilli Crab in Singapore was a must and we were blown away by the Chilli Crab at Leo's. It was fresh and full of flavour. The service at Leo's was also fantastic and the restaurant is set in a quaint shopping area highlight with fairy lights at night time. The crab was approximately $60 per kilo. I'm not sure how this rates in value at other places but I was very impressed with the quality
5
Cafe Leo is a 'must visit' whenever we're in Singapore. The charming courtyard is so unexpected right in the heart of the city, and lends a relaxed, almost continental feel. But the flavours are what keep us coming back. Try the butter chicken, or the pepper beef. The staff is friendly and efficient. We'll be back
4
We enjoyed a great meal of local foods. The food was individually prepared to your personal spice level! The food was piping hot with a generous portion size. My meal had a wonderful selection of seafood. We are here for 4 days and will be back here again
5
Very good food and excelent service om this little local restaurant and cheap beer Leo and his daughter is always worth a visit
4
It’s quite a good place to hang out at night time. Nothing can be better in a summer night than sitting outside and chill out with friends. The service is great, they were very friendly. Food was ok, with a reasonable price.
5
You don't expect a place with great reviews fir Chinese food to serve you a brilliant steak but that's just what happened ! Really liked it , it's not posh more family & surrounded by reasonably priced bars where local Singaporeans in the know go . This place had great food & the bar opposite has bottles of French wine for $s18 that's Â£9! Unheard of in Singapore . You eat outside & all is good 
5
We would recommended Leo by our friends. It is an excellent restaurant serve Chinese food. We enjoyed our dinner outside and felt so excited. The menu was diverse and well explained by the waiter. Most of dishes had strong flavor and was so tasty, I really liked the hot plate black pepper prawn. Moreover, the staff was so helpfun and hospitable. Overall we would recommend this place to anyone who will visit Singapore
5
We visited on our last trip to Singapore 4 years ago and never forgot this place. Chilli mud crab was sensational. We just had to return this trip and we were pleased to see Leo is still there and the food is still sensational. We also had Pepper ginger beef this time. Leo remembered us too which was heart warming. We highly recommend you visit Leo and his daughter.
5
A very good restaurant, both local and Western food (which is rare!). We loved that we could serve our dinner outside, it will always make food have a better taste. We choose this place after reading a few recommendation and it has not disappointed us. The dishes are well presented and not only had it looked good, it is also tastefully. The staff is top notch without anything to reproach, they serves us impeccably and fast and they make sure we got everything we need. Overall we do recommend this place to anyone who will visit Singapore
4
Small cafe in the court near Little India area of Singapore. It's a small cafe with good service. The kitchen is small so don't go in a rush they make everything fresh. We had the hot plate chicken and the chicken friend rice both were really good
4
After seeing the great reviews for this place I decided to meet a friend here for dinner one night during my trip to Singapore. I was staying at a hotel nearby so the location was very convenient. My friend ordered the Thai salad with tofu and found it to be very good. The fried tofu was juicy and tender and was mixed with onions, carrots, and lettuce in a sweet and spicy thai sauce....a very light, healthy, and fulfilling salad. I ordered the fish and chips and also enjoyed my meal. The fish was flavorful, but I would have preferred a few more fries with the meal.The service was adequate, price was reasonable, and the setting in the courtyard was terrific.It's definitely a good restaurant that I would eat at again, but I'm unsure what merits the #15 ranking on here with all the great restaurants in Singapore
5
The staff, was very friendly & welcoming and also very helpful. She ask me would i like spicy food and i say oh.. yes i love spicy food. And she recommend me spicy prawns and having with stem rice. It's soo fabulous it just right to my taste. The prawns it very fresh and baby kailan with garlic it soo delicious and make my dinner fantastic and the best food that i ever had in Singapore. The seating was very comfortable and only out side seating. The chef father also very friendly, and all i really enjoy my pleasant and delicious meal. And make me feel at home. Definitely i be back again
5
Friendly owner that make you feel like having dinner at your own house. Homely cooked food that make you almost forgotten that you are full. The open area is superb. Having dinner is a great enjoyment with lightly breeze blown occasionally. The chilli crab is amazing
4
The man who owns/runs this place is actually named Leo. They have a wide variety of fusion food - chinese, indian, and some western. All of it was really quite good and quite reasonably priced.
5
Great food. This was my fourth visit and I can confirm that
The place is still as good as the previous visits.
4
After reading all the reviews, we hoped to get some of the best food in Singapore. Let me say that it was not bad at all, but I was hoping for a better level. Good food for the price. Close by the Albert Court hotel.
5
Spent two days at the albert village court hotel.....ate here twice, the best service and great food.
Will come back next time i'm in singapore.

Leo Cafe and Resturant is a friendly place to relax and enjoy a delicious meal. It's menu is suitable for both vegetarians and meat eaters alike.
4
Try it - its wonderful. Great service, good food, pleasant location. Food cooked from scratch and full of flavour.
4
we choose Leo Cafe because of silly idea . It s the same as my horoscope x: but it doesnt let me down . We got warm welcome since my first steps. we not only enjoy a fabulous cup of capuccino but also do a lot of delicious food. We love scallops so much with broccoli . They all are so fresh . The atsmosphere is so quite. We have peaceful evening in Leo Caf
5
I have been going to Singapore regularly every year & stay around the Albert court area, I first sat at this café 2.5yrs ago & liked it so much I have always eaten there ever since..... the food & the service is everything you would desire. The staff go out of there way to make you feel at home & very friendly, I wish there were more café/restaurants like them....... Owe
1
I wish I had read the negative reviews first before coming to this restaurant. Based on it's outstanding Trip Advisor ranking, my boyfriend and I checked out this place. Mistake. Good service is it for positives. Only outdoor seating, and on a hot humid day - very uncomfortable. The food was mediocre. I got the dumplings as an app and the scallops and broccoli as my main - worse scallops I've ever had. They were so chewy! Worst dumplings i've ever had. And they were pricey for what they were. And then to be charged $20 per plate for food that so could easily be beat out by a hawker center only added insult to injury. Trip Advisor is usually on point. This one was a let down
5
As a regular visitor to the Albert Court Hotel I have dined at Leos on many occassions.. Very friendly, very cold beer and excellent freshly cooked food served in the courtyard. Caters for all tastes but I love the chicken wings and the asian chicken curry
5
Mid afternoon it was quiet but, instead of having to wake someone up and feeling like we were an inconvenience, we got very individual advice and service and really enjoyed the recommended curries. Nice place. As others have commented, relatively reasonable prices too.
5
Set upon an Alfresco style of eating, we found Leo's to be excellent. The staff were very friendly and the meal was fantastic. Full of flavour and reasonably priced. Definitely worth the visit. Until next time Leo....
5
Leo's Cafe&Restaurant is really worth to visit. Exceptional service so you feel very welcome and food is heavenly :)
4
Great place, we read so much about it that we gave it a try, it is in a great place behind Albert Court Hotel, they have good food, we loved the spring rolls they were no greasy and great taste, also the signature rice was really good. The personal was really friendly. It is a good choice specially if you are around serangoon road
5
Leo's was opposite our hotel (Village Hotel Albert Court) and we ate there a couple of times during our recent stay in Singapore. The food is freshly cooked to order and the service from the staff is excellent and very personal. They talked us through the menu and our likes and dis-likes and gauged how hot/spicy we wanted the food. They recommended a couple of their specialitty dishes from the menu and we were not disappointed.Whilst there is only outside seating and a small kitchen, do not be put off, as there is some shade and they have fans to keep diners comfortable. It was recommended to us by another couple staying in our hotel and we happily recommended it to others
5
We visited Leo's on our short stay in Singapore. We found the restaurant on Trip Advisor and went out of our way to find it. It's a bit hidden away but is well worth tracking down for a relaxed dinner with attentive staff and great value food.Everything is cooked to your taste preference. I was asked how spicy I wanted my dish and this was taken into account when it arrived. Highly recommended
4
This place was just opposite our hotel so it was a convenient choice. Even though the seating is outdoors, they have plenty of fans so it is quite comfortable. The food was good, and the service was great. The staff was friendly. However, we spent around S$40 and while this is not pricey, we did manage to eat lots of food in Singapore for cheaper, admittedly the venues were not as nice. If you are looking for a nice, calm meal - then this is a good place, however, if you are a bit more adventurous then there are lots of places nearby where you can get much cheaper food
5
Everytime when I have been in Singapore since 2007year, I am visiting Mr. Leo and his daughter restaurant and everytime I am satisfied with theirs cuisine - especially tender sliced meat with ginger and spicy is all the time ny the best choice, I can only recommend
4
On a flying and busy visit to Singapore one would be tempted to resort to convenient nutrition. But a quick check over the good nearby possibilities on Tripadvisor and Leo’s Café and Restaurant looks too tempting. The menu is quite brief and sadly the “Fiery” Crab signature dish was not available. But the Stir Fried Gambaro and the Black Pepper and Ginger Sliced Beef looked to be good replacements and for starters we sought a round of Vegetable Dumplings. The service was friendly and efficient and the yummy dumplings were with us in a flash. How did they know we were so hungry? The Gambaro prawns were fat, fresh and very tasty and just the right degree of “hot” to taste. Black Pepper and Ginger Sliced Beef was hot, hot and hit the spot nicely. The sesame and coriander give this dish a refreshing lift. And the whole thing washed down with a Tiger or two. Leo’s Café and Restaurant is just a bit more than a hole in the wall, a handful of outside tables under some awning, so it could not be called flash or sophisticated. And maybe gourmet is not quite the appellation. But Leo’s is definitely quite a few notches beyond nutrition and is well worth seeking out
4
This is a restaurant that you will never pay extra notice when you walked past. No fanciful decor and just like any other restaurant/cafe along the stretch of shops. But this is also where the place stands out. The courtyard sitting is comfortable with a small candle at night for lighting. Rest Assure you have enough lighting to see what you actually are eating.Food wise, the portions were generous. The taste was very good as well. Had the grilled salmon and beef fried rice. The service was very good as well. The lady serving us actually told us to switched from grilled dory to salmon. And the best part was that unlike some other restaurants who wants a quick turnaround, they allow you to sit there and chat. Will defintely return again.!
3
A small restaurant, in a very nice court.
Nice and friendly staff, good food, resonable prices considering the location.
5
I had a fantastic meal at this restaurant. Faultless service, excellent food and good prices. It'd be rude not to eat here if you're only in town a few days.
3
Lovely food (*great vegetarian options!), comfortable outdoor seating and a kindly accommodating host. We all had a great time here.
5
thanks for my best friend recommendation. And i'm so happy that my friend from Hong Kong likes the foods so much when I brought her over tonight for dinner.We have a nice chat during the dinner where environment is so cozy and relax.Good service and nice food at reasonable price. I'll be back soon with some other friends. :
5
Well i found this place being on the top 10 on tripadvisor...and i must admit it is fantastic to find places in the areas that you didn't know existed in the town you are living in :)This place was perfect, nicely located off Little India in a quite area called Albert Court...it is away from the main hustle and bustle but a perfect area to chill and relax.The owners are very pleasant and the food was extremely tasty. In fact i was keen to get their recommendation so opted for the seafood noodles and chose a side vegetables of baby kai with garlic - accompanied by pineapple juice. All in all a delicious meal, great service, great quality and quite reasonable. would definitely recommend a visit :
4
We went here in the early evening on a Thursday night, purely on the strength of TA reviews so when we got there I had to brake my first rule of dinning out 'never going into an empty restaurant or one with only a few customers'. Considering TA's reviews it was a little disappointing, my wife's dish was slightly stodgy and perhaps a little overpriced. On the plus side the menu was quite extensive and at least the peanuts were free
3
I see this cafe ranks no.2 out of 2000+ restaurants in Singapore, it attracts us to give a try.Situated in Rochor district where is filled with arts schools, colleges and institutes, the atmosphere around Albert street is very relaxing and holiday feeling. it is a nice area to hang around, which motivates us to pay a visit. It is not a big cafe and it only serves outdoor seat though, the staffs are very patient and friendly to host the guests. A tip to visitors: it is recommended to wear shorts not jeans to visit here, from our experience, we wore jeans and sat outdoor for entire night, the atmosphere was nice and the fan was on though, we were still sweating completely... From the menu, well indeed I was hoping to try few 'signature' dishes which made this cafe ranks no.2 out of 2000+ restaurants in SG according to TripAdvisor, the staff recommended us some and here they came... portion was small... well, price was average high but not cheap at all, portion just unexpectedly small that I felt like we paid high for them... for the fry rice, I got a foto to show how 'big' it was, the bowl is like as big as my hand... Spring rolls, deep fry dumplings... I know they're frozen kind and not freshly made, apparently foreigners would find them special but I know, they just so simple.... what else? The black pepper prawns. A strong flavor dish, strong taste doesn't mean fresh. Totally tasteless of the (frozen) prawns. The taste of prawns simply covered (hided) from the strong pepper taste. For foreign people, perhaps they know/taste less of asian food but is this cafe really good at the Asian cuisine? I doubt... There are plenty places nearby for nicer Asian cuisine...I had no regret to visit Albert street area and this cafe (friendly staffs and nice atmosphere), but I was a bit disappointed or expectation too high of its cuisines here. Simply strong flavors but not really special nor impressive at all.Still, it deserves for a shot of visit, no harm. The closest MRT station to get here would be Bugis. Hope you have a good nightAverage per head: SGD 30 (food + drink
4
We were curious to learn if Leo Cafe is one of those often highly-rated restaurants that has super-good friendliness and service but average-tasting food. We finally visited at about 3 pm on a drizzly day and sat outside, protected and comfortable under the wide umbrellas. We shared pepper beef with ginger and found that the meat was tender and tasty. We were happy to see that they offered fried mantou (I think they called it "rolls" for S$1.50 each, at the back of the menu) which we ate with the beef instead of white rice. They provided free water. My wife ordered orange juice from the carton which was a bit watery. The owner and his daughter were very friendly. I would rate the food/price between average and very good. If we return, it would be for the fried mantou which really enhanced the taste of the pepper beef, and we would like to try it with the Indian curry
4
Enjoyed our dinner very much here. Prices are nett so no annoying extra charges that can add 17% onto your bill. Situated in a courtyard style area owned by a hotel the individual units are rented to individuals such as Leo's. We met what I presume was the owner and had very good service from him and the lady. Food was very freshly cooked and nuts / water were complimentary which is rare in Singapore (Esp nuts!!) Tiger reasonably priced also.Overall we would say go here and we'd also return on another Singapore trip
3
Nice pavement cafe serving good Chinese food. Quality good and prices ok for Singapore, but not exceptional enough to make it a special trip, given number of restaurants in Singapore all serving this sort of thing. But if you are walking past, definitely worth a stop
5
Fantastic food with great choices in menu. Nice music and we order start,main and dessert, all in one hour hour.The atmosphere was boutique and very relaxing as well.
3
great place to hangout. Its location in a courtyard, and was nice to sit outside and experience to mix culture in little India. Great service and excellent food, recommended to friends.
5
It is a good value restaurant in the middle of a very cute, outdoor strip at Albert's Court with nice, pricey restaurants all around. It's a bit expensive for Chinese food though, but super worth it for a nice night out.
5
Found this restairant via Tripadvisor with great value . Food was fantastic and staffs were extremely welcome. out-door seats were great, especially at night. Staffs would meet all our requests. Great and would come back again
4
Had a quiet meal here a couple of weeks ago and it was superb. Tasty lamb and great beef dishes accompanied with delicious rice. It's a crime that this place was practically empty as the food quality, service and ambience deserve a full restaurant every night. Not too hard on the wallet either...we'll definitely be back regularly..
4
My wife and I dined here in late March 2013. Food was very good - we chose Asian dishes and were not disappointed. A nice outdoor setting on a pedestrian mall opposite the Albert Court Village Hotel. Both food and drinks were reasonable priced by Singapore standards. Will come back next time we're in Singapore
5
We have had dinner here and were really satisfied with the quality of food we received. We had several startes and several main courses and shared everything. The Shrimps with chilies and the beef with black pepper was outstanding and the Indian Chicken Curry was excellent too.You are able to sit outside away from the noise streets and take some time off the hectic city
5
I found this cafe thanks to the reviews on trip advisor. Its location in a quiet courtyard provided a welcome break from the overcrowded streets of Little India. It was nice to be able to sit outside and enjoy a warm evening. The service was excellent and the food was fresh and delicious
5
I had passed this restaurant a number of times and after returning very hot and hungry from one of my morning sightseeing adventures, I went there for a late lunch.I received a very warm welcome (and an ice cold glass of water) from Vicki and after taking my order, she sat me at a table closest to the fans and pointed them in my direction to cool me down. Their menu consists of both local and western food and they also offer a variiety of drinks and cocktails at very reasonable prices. Whilst I was waiting for my food and drink, her father sat and had a chat with me. I had a wonderful conversation with him and he was very knowledgable and informative. I found out that he was 70, which quite surprised me, as he looked 10 years younger!! My chicken fried rice with vegetables arrived and it was very tasty indeed. The Singapore Sling went down very well too!!I went there for lunch every day after that and always found the food and service fantastic and willcertainly eat there again

My husband and I enjoyed a very good dinner at Leo Cafe & Restaurant while on a 3 day trip to Singapore in January. We chose to sit outside, and found both the service and food to be of a very high quality. Not only did we enjoy the location of this restaurant, which was very close to our hotel (the Ibis Bencoolen), as well as being on a pedestrian street which provided fun people watching opportunities, but we also found it to be reasonably priced. We would definitely recommend the Leo Cafe as a place to dine in Singapore
5
Saw the recommendation on TripAdvisor. Small, clean sidewalk cafe with excellant food. Family run (Leo is the family name). Very personal service with hot freshly prepared food. Reasonable prices.

Small place with quite good food, especialy in terms of value for money. Worth visiting if you are in the area, but do not expect miracles, my expectations vere high base on past reviews, maybe that was the reason why I was not amazed.

Okay. So we tried this place because of it's ranking on Tripadvisor. We have found a lot of nice restaurants that way. But this restaurant is cwrtainly not one of them!Let's start with the positives. The location is nice, sitting in a nice square with trees and lights. Very pretty. It gets one point for that. And as has been said in other reviews, the service is very good. The staff are friendly, polite and attentive. Another point for that.But that is where the points run out, because the food was, to put it bluntly, pretty awful. I ordered the butter chicken as I am fond of this dish and it was recommended in the reviews. Well, what I was given was the worst butter chicken I have ever had. In fact, it bore little resemblance to butter chicken. It was very, very sweet (i wonder how many spoonfuls of sugar) and the dominant taste was coconut (which is not an ingredient in traditional butter chicken). It tasted more like a koorma, and a bad one at that.My Indonesian wife ordered Chicken Opur (Opur Ayam), which is an Indoensian curry. it was also very sweet indeed. She didnt eat much of it....... she said it wasnt very nice.Maybe we ordered the wrong food. I am not a fan of excessive ginger, so I chose not to order the black pepper and ginger beef dish which is recommended in other reviews. The review is based on the food we ordered, and in my opinion it was well below average for Singapore.No idea how this place became ranked so highly. But I might try the Indian place next door, the pleasant smells wafting from that direction suggest that their butter chicken will be a lot better than Leo's!Avoid

went there for beer in the evening cause you were allowed to smoke outside. place next to it had cheaper beer but you were not allowed to smoke outside...had dinner there one night, excellent!the owner and especially his daughter are really nice people and have time for a chat
3
We ate here on the strength of Tripadvisor reviews. We had a perfectly pleasant meal; the service was efficient and friendly; the value for money was good but there was nothing outstanding about the experience and we were left wondering why other diners had rated it quite so highly
4
My husband & I went to Leo's Cafe last Friday night (15/02/2013) as the reviews onTrip Advisor recommened it. I was expecting a lavish restaurant that you sat inside, but was pleasantly surprised when I arrived. Sitting outside was fantastic as it was a lovely night. We had the Tender Beef sliced with ginger - OMG how nice was that!!! We also had the Spicy Garlic Prawns they were nice but not as good as the beef. The fried dumplings were also fantastic. Thank you Leo and Vicki (his daughter) for making our night memorable. We will definetly return to Leo's Cafe next time we're in singapore. If you get a chance please do your self a favour and have a meal or two at Leo's Cafe & Restaurant 180 Albert St

We stayed quite close by at the Ibis Bencoolen so went to Leo's based on the advice of other TA's. Situated in a lovely no traffic street it was blink and miss it. We sat outside under large umbrellas although raining a little to soak in local atmosphere. Service was very much family feel friendly and the food was fresh and good. Although not typical Chinese food we thought, there were enough choices to ensure we were not disappointed. Good value and easy
5
The guy who runs Leo's (Leo himself probably) is charming and very enthusiastic about his menu. It was pouring with rain when we went and he made sure we did not get wet and were comfortable. The food was fantastic. We had a beef and a prawn dish and shared the rice. Highly recommended but you could walk past it if not careful as it does not look anything special from the outside
3
I wanted to check out the place with friends because it gets quite consistent high ratings. Given the high expectations I was actually quite disappointed. There is nothing wrong with the food, but it's just about average compared to so many other great places Singapore has to offer.The cuisine type Chinese is not true. The restaurant serves anything from regional to western food. Service was a bit slow on a very quiet night, but I give them credit for friendliness.If you are in the area and you are looking for a decent place to eat, go for it. If you are looking for a truly no.1 dining experience, you need to look somewhere else
5
We were in Singapore for a few days in December on our way to Bali and went to LeoÂ´s because of TA recommendations. We were not disappointed. Excellent, freshly cooked food very reasonably priced. Exceptionally warm and polite sevice in a a peacefull courtyard environment. What more can you ask!? We returned the following night and two more nights in January when we returned from Yogya on our way back to Norway. We will surely return to Leo and his daughter in the future
5
Interesting food, well prepared and presented by attentive wait staff make Leo Cafe a delightful place to eat. Located in the charming oasis of Albert's Court not far from Little India MRT Station, Leo Cafe will see us again, soon.
5
I have dined here many times over the last three years or so, and have never been disappointed. I consider Leo and Vicki to be good friends after this time.
4
Seating was outside shaded. Quite hot in the middle of the day but with the one big fan switched on it was tolerable. Service was personal and friendly. Food was prepared and cooked on order. We ordered Asian food - fried rice, brocolli with mushrooms and bransprouts with salted fish. Taste was the average Asian and was good
5
We had an overnight stay in Singapore and decided to go here after what we read on Trip Advisor, we arrived quite late around 9.30pm and were the only people here. We didn't let that put us off. The food was freshly cooked. The pan fried ginger beef was mouth watering and the deep fried dumplings were the best I have ever had.The owner afterwards thanked us by shaking our hands which was a nice touch.I highly recommend this place if you want good fresh cooked food without the hassle of over paying and somewhere relatively quiet
5
We were in Singapore for almost 6 days and managed to visit this magnificent resturant two times.Decided to have new years dinner here after reading the great reviews received. Great food and top notch service from the employes. We strongly recommend to visit Leo cafe when visisting Singapore.Found the simple environment cozy and relaxing.Linda and Per from Swede
5
Leo and his daughter Vicky always make us feel so welcome - it's like a home from home for us now. We've been living in Singapore for a year and go once a week to have a meal there, that speaks for itself. The food is good quality, fresh and at an affordable price. Carry on the good work Leo, and Vicky of course 
5
We greatly enjoyed dining in this friendly, affordable restaurant twice during a short stay in Singapore. The food was delicious and the service was great. Mr. Leo enjoys chatting with the diners in the evenings and the service at lunch time was equally as friendly. I chose prawns both times. They were cooked and served to perfection and the serving size was generous
5
Singapore is an expensive dining experience at the best of times and it is a real delight to find somewhere that is affordable and good quality.The service was prompt and the food "Pepper prawns" tasted as if the prawns where taken from the sea minutes before, delicious.I would happily go back and wish for others to enjoy. Do yourself a favour
5
Visited Leo Cafe & Restaurant with friends for dinner. Commendable service and friendly staffs who chatted with us in Alfesco setting. Our food was served hot and fresh direct from the kitchen which we liked. The black pepper crabs and spicy prawns tasted excellent apart from our other orders of Kampong fired rice and broccoli with scallops
5
We sought this place out based on TA recommendations and we weren't disappointed. We love to eat in family run places as you get a much better experience. Chicken wings you'd sell your mother for and a great meal all round. Amazing Singapore slings too. Service was excellent especially given how busy they were. Oh and the home roasted peanuts to start were a delicious touch.
2
Top ranking restaurant? You must be kidding!
I visited this place with my husband - found it laid back with simple, no-frills food but average.
Just a good place to relax only but only if it does not rain.
5
Ideal if you're staying at the Albert Court Hotel as it's right outside. Friendly staff and good quality, honest food.
5
We went to Leo's Cafe and Restaurant specifically because it was rated the best Chinese restaurant in Singapore on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed! The oxtail soup was fantastic, as were all the other dishes we ordered. The setting is very pleasant, with a patio away from the bustle of the streets of Singapore. And Leo, the owner, is very friendly and took time to chat. This was our first meal in Singapore, and we'll definitely be back! Go to Leo's Restaurant for a great and affordable experience
5
Freshly prepared food made to order. My Wife and i came here before and had the best crab ever! This time we had a light lunch and again enjoyed the fresh food and personal service. It seems the owner and his Daughter really enjoy delighting people with their exceptional service and superb food. This for them is a passion, not a business. Outside seating in a quiet courtyard. Brilliant.
3
Family run - Good variety of food - Local, Asian, and Steak. They will do a vegetarian version of the local Asian food. Staff is friendly but seriously this can't be number 1. Only tourists would rate this as number. There are many other options that should be at the top
5
We highly recommend a visit to Leo Cafe & Restaurant while in Singapore. A small family run Al-fresco restaurant in the center of town. Excellent food and service all under the attentive eye of Mr. Leo. We came back three times during our week long stay in Singapore. Try the black pepper crab and the seafood fried rice. They also serve a very good coffee. And all at very reasonable prices. Keep it up Leo, we will be back
4
We were headed to Singapore on board a cruise ship and decided with a group of newly made friends to dine together in Singapore. Naturally,Trip Advisor came to the rescue and we emailed Leo's to reserve a table. The response was prompt. A table would be held for us until 15 minutes after the allotted time! We were certainly expecting more than we got! Leo's is an unassuming dining experience with friendly, family service and the utmost care to having your needs met. The food was delicious - we tried a whole variety of the specials and other suggestions. We were not disappointed. If you are looking for a homey, intimate dining experience, this is it
5
I found this place from recommendations in TripAdvisor and I have to say I was not disappointed. It was exactly what I was looking for on a chilled out Friday evening. I think I must have timed my visit perfectly as the general area that this cafe is in was not too busy and I was immediately sat down at my choice of table with the owner and his daughters giving me their full attention. On asking what they recommended I was shown the Kind Prawns and given several options as to what way I wanted them marinated. I chose the black pepper stir fry option and have to say that I have yet to try better in Singapore. The food was really fresh and cooked to perfection, obviously with some care and the portion size was huge. I thought the free home roasted peanuts was also a nice touch. I also had a very tasty mushroom soup for starter and the house favourite spring rolls.The general atmosphere around the cafe is one of ease and I did not mind having to wait for my meal to arrive as you know they are cooking it to order. As it was the weekend there was also some nice live background music being played by a local band. Having thoroughly enjoyed my meal, chatting to the owner and the overall experience I will definitely be making a point of coming back here again soon with friends

My family and I decided to check out this restaurant after seeing it is ranked #1 in Singapore. As it turned out this is an al fresco eatery more than a restaurant. There is no seating in the eatery with all tables and seats located outside. It carried a variety of local and western food. Tried the spring roll, calamari, spaghetti and kampong fried rice. Other than the fried rice the rest of the food is nothing specacular. Even then the fried rice is not the best that I have tried in Singapore.Service wise the eatery is above average. When it started to rain after we placed our order for lunch the staff told us to moved to another table which has better shelter. However when the rain got heavier, she told us to sit in the restaurant which incidently has only 1 table and 3 chairs. The staff also offered us peanuts free of charge even though the bad weather has nothing to do with the eatery. However I must say that it is too cramped for patrons to sit inside the restaurant.I think lunch time will be too hot to have a meal there. Dinner would be better. But if it rains, the whole place will be rather messy.This eatery is OK but it cannot be ranked #1 in Singapore

Usually when in a new city my husband & I would head straight to the best Michelin rated restaurant the place has to offer but thanks to many fellow Tripadvisor reviewers last night I ventured to Leo's cafe & restaurant. This little, unassuming spot with it's brightly lit blue & yellow sign doesn't appear to be much more than a nice place to sit & watch the world go by on Albert court but don't let that dissuade you from trying the local dishes on offer (he does also offer western menu choices such as steak etc). Having spent all day on our feet exploring the city we were ravenous so opted for some of Leo's secret recipe chicken wings while we decided what to order. As a lover of KFC when I have had a few too many to drink let me tell you that Colonel Sanders would have some competition if Leo went global, this fried chicken was finger lickin' good. Crunchy & a little spicy, yum yum.We weren't hugely adventurous with our selection of food to share, we decided on chicken fried rice, sizzling lamb cubes, vegetable noodles & butter chicken curry. It was all delicious!! Leo had asked how spicy we wanted everything & I was sorry we had said medium for each dish as it was only fiery enough to warm the palate (I guess they are used to many westerners being overcome by the chilli heat). There were lots of other choices on the menu, the beef with ginger looked good too. You do have to order the crab & lobster dishes in advance so be sure to get your hotel give them a quick call for you at least the day before. The staff are all lovely & Leo himself is a little gem, he was so pleased we had come to vist them & appreciated his food. You can see in the kitchen from the street & all dishes are made to order.As you can tell I really enjoyed this little place & when the bill came to less than 90 Singapore dollars (this includes a jug of Tiger beer & a soft drink) we were very happy indeed. When we return to Singapore we will certainly return to Leo's
5
I very much enjoyed my meal at Leo Cafe. The beef and ginger dish was excellent. The beer was cold. This is a good, friendly restaurant at reasonable prices. The service is excellent and the location in the precinct outside the Albert Court Hotel is very pleasant. A great place to sit outside, relax and enjoy a Singapore evening. Thanks to Leo and Vicki
5
It was our first trip to singapore and we opted to this restaurant because of the review and we are happy to say say that food was very good as the service. Loved the black pepper prawn and the asian chicken. we would come come for sure again
5
Went last night after seeing the good reviews. Lovely setting with all the christmas trees lit. Food good. Had the beef and ginger dish along with the chilli chicken. Slightly hot for me but my husband loved it. The signature rice and the spring rolls were particularly good. But the star of the meal was the oxtail soup which I was not sure about ordering but turned out to be great. Needless to say we both ate far too much. The service was very friendly with all the staff engaging with the customers and making them feel valued. Leo took interest in where we were from and how we had heard about his cafe.One minus was the lack of a toilet. Although the staff assured us it was agreed we felt awkward using the facilities in a nearby hotel.That aside top marks to Leo Cafe
3
Went to Leo Cafe based upon all the rave reviews. Was generally disappointed. The chili crab was about the size if my fist, quite spicy (we asked for it mild), and at about $30 USD not much of a value to feed three. The chicken fried rice was great and the black pepper prawns were good. Also, be aware that if you ask Leo to call a cab for you there will be an extra booking charge added to your taxi fare.
5
Five stars for the friendly staffs who attended to us. The black pepper crab was delicious, it is not too spicy and price was very reasonable for the kind of food and service. I also ordered calamari, garlic prawns and seafood fried rice. Had an enjoyable meal with good ambience.Thanks Leo
4
Had dinner there last night with a friend. What really stood out for me was the friendly service and the owner's eagerness to engage with the diners to find out if they're happy. The food was very good but not necessarily the bet I've ever had in Singapore. Really enjoyed the black pepper beef with ginger, the fried calamari appetizer and the garlic prawns. Well worth the visit and would recommend to my friends and colleagues.
5
Excellent meal. Choose the Asian Butter Chicken and Black pepper prawns which were very tasty, served with a healthy portion and tender.Would recommend this place to anyone who wants a good eating experience without having to pay for an overpriced bill. It was worth a visit and I left this place smiling with a full stomach!
5
We ate here on a stopover on our journey to Australia and found the food to be tasty and good. Besides that it was also very reasonably priced. When we returned home via Singapore a couple of weeks later we therefore again choosed Leos for a late lunch one day. At the restaurant they remembered us (which we found quite interresting) and warmly greeted us back. Also this time the food was outstanding, but especially so the the spring rolls. We have never eaten more delicious spring rolls in our life! The restaurant is quiet with an attractive setting and very friendly personnel who makes you feel at home and special
5
Returned to the wonderful Leo,s in the Albert Court Courtyard, and another excellent meal and very attentive service from Vicky and her assistant. Once agin the food was very good and opted for the Asian Butter Chicken and Black pepper prawns which were a very healthy portion and cooked to perfection. Would advise all to try for an inexpensive and delightful dining experience in very quite and comfortable surrounding
5
it's our second visit and their service is ever friendly and the food is as delicious as before. this time we ordered black pepper prawn (again), basil chicken, sweet n sour chicken. The prawns were very fresh and juicy, loving it. it was another great dining experience at Leo's
5
Well, it's been a long while since my visit at Leo's Cafe but I still remember it. The service was friendly, the food was tasty and the local area wasn't as noisy as at the other restaurants. Also cold beer. You can't argue with that.
5
We went to Leo's after reading other reviews and were not disappointed. Lovely outdoor setting with the friendliest,most helpful staff. The food was very enjoyable and reasonably priced. Will definately return on our next visit to singapore.
4
It's interesting that Leo's is the #1 restaurant in Singapore, and a bit puzzling. The food is good (at least the Asian dishes I tried were) and the service is very personal and attentive, especially in the evening when the chef's dad is on duty front of house, but Singapore is full of wonderful places to eat and Leo's would not be my number one. I've eaten there a couple of times and it was not busy on either occasion, as I would have expected given its rating. That said, good food for the price, really interesting location and very nice service.
5
We had a wondeful dinner at Leo Cafe & Restaurant and one could never expect a small and humble cafe could have such good quality food.My family and I will definitely go back to Leo Cafe & Restaurant when we are back in Singapore. Highly recommended Leo Cafe & Restaurant to all.
5
I had dinner in this restaurant several time, whenever I visited Singapore, I always poped by. For one simple reason...The food is just simply great, nothing overly fancy but quality food. The interior is simple and humble. It is more like a place where people bring their family to have dinner together just some kind of dinner with friends. You don't have to worry about what you are wearing, nor table manner...this place is very relaxed, just a local place where you can chit chat and gathered with friend to enjoy good meal.The recommended dishes would be grilled salmon, tender beef with ginger and black pepper, kampong fried rice with beef, oxtail soups, If you can take spicy food, you should not miss "spicy or black pepper prawn"...asean chicken curry...If you like spicy dishes...that would be even better...I will miss this place and promise to visit again when I have time to go to Singapore"Love the ambience, and love the food
3
I agree with Wmpj's review and was very surprised that this is No. 1 on the Tripadvisor Singapore Restaurants' list. The food is not bad but having lived here for over 40 years and given that I eat out regularly, I cannot say that this is the place offering the best dining experience in Singapore.To me, its very much like a restaurant within the "Jack's Place" chain. I notice that most of the reviewers who gave them "Excellent" or "Above Average" ratings were foreigners and they may have enjoyed the al fresco experience and the servings of Western and Asian food at reasonable prices. I tried the Indian curry and I thought it was a little too sweet for my liking and that I could have gotten something more authentic at a nearby Serangoon Road Indian restaurant. Service by Mr Leo (the chef's father) and other staff members were friendly, as one would expect from a family-run and small restaurant. As much as I did enjoy the evening, I wouldn't say that I would make a special trip again for the food
5
On arriving in Singapore we ate at Leo's several nights. On the first night there we were greeted by Leo and assured us he would give us the best food in Singapore and he was right! The food was always served up in large portions and is excellent quality. The staff are very friendly and give good recommendations on what to select from the menu. They will also accommodate any special orders which is rare in Singapore! Lovely place for dinner any day of the week!
5
I have had meals at Leo Cafe on several occasions. The food is consistently very good. Very good portions, beautiful flavours.The wine list is well chosen and the beer very cold! I also like the setting, it is made to look like a traditional Singapore Street with the louvred shutters on the windows. At night there is a very good atmosphere and Miss Vicki is a great hostess as well as an accomplished cook. She is very welcoming and friendly.I would thoroughly recommend this as the No.1 place to eat when visiting Singapore. Andre

We ate at Leo's cafe and restaurant after reading generous reviews on tripadvisor, where it rated number 1 restaurant in Singapore when we were there (Oct 2012). Don't misunderstand, there's nothing wrong with Leo's if you're looking for a budget meal, but it's no epicurean experience should that be what you're looking for. The food was tasty but nothing exceptional. The service was friendly but this is a cafe more than a restaurant. Paper table napkins, no table cloth, a box of tissues placed on each table (I'm not sure why), a small wine list dominated by yellow tail (the bulk Australian wine which I would never, ever drink). No tables inside, though the courtyard setting is pleasant enough
5
We stayed four nights at the Albert Court Village Hotel and Leo Cafe is in the hotel courtyard, surrounded by restored and redeveloped Singapore shophouses. Hot and weary from an afternoon exploring Little India, we thought we'd relax with a cold drink before heading out again for the evening.Leo's was as far as we went.It was very early for an evening meal, by Singapore standards, and Mr Leo had no other customers so we enjoyed his undivided attention for at least 40 minutes until other customers started arriving. He's real character and it was delightful to meet him and Vicki.The food? Excellent! Chilli, spices, fresh, fresh, fresh. The menu includes Chinese and western dishes and we were told it varies.Highly recommended
5
The food here is exceptionally good and the service is very friendly. The Chlli Crab is better than that served at the high end places.
If you enjoy good food this is the place to eat.

5
Really good food, prices ok for singapore, staff is very friendly. We liked the chili chicken the most, its worth a try. Overall i think its a very good choice
5
Leo cafe combines very good food with great service in a courtyard location where you can dine outside on a sultry Singaporean evening. The beer was ice cold, the food tasty and freshly cooked and the atmosphere and service were excellent.
5
We were very happy to have stumbled upon this amazing restaurant. The food was cooked to perfection and the service was excellent. I plan on a return trip there the next time I'm in Singapore.
5
Leo"s Cafe and Restaurant is definetly the best place in town.Feels like coming to home when visit here and food is better that "mom"s made" ( please don"t tell her :) I could recommend this restaurant with 8 years history.. I allways know where to go, to have a wonderful food / meal and service when visiting Singapore
5
i went to this restaurant because it is highly recommended on trip advisor. I was a little disappointed when we arrived there, but we loved it after the food came. The food was so gorgeous that i can't really complain. good place to eat and tal
5
Leo's is a great place to eat if you are after casual street dining. A great place to sit back, eat and enjoy a few beers in the evening. The service is very attentive and the food is top notch. The chilli beef is definitely worth a try. The quality of food is above average for Singapore and the value is also very good.It is a great choice for lunch or if you are looking for somewhere inexpensive to eat for dinner
3
I went here because it was #1 on Trip advisor. I was surprised to see the setting - it was just like any other street restaurant and only outside dining. But still I gave it a try. It was interesting. I could see why so many loved the service, it was truly the most friendly I have recieved in Singapore. The food was good, above average, but not worthy of number 1 on Tripadvisor, Singapore
5
We were staying at Albert Court Hotel and found Leos - what a find. I was suffering from stomach problems and after explaing my situation to Mr Leo, he and Vikki were able to prepare something that I could eat. We tended to make Leos our venue for meals over the few days we were in Singapore and was able to explore more of the wonderful choices on the menu as I improved. Many thanks to Mr Leo and Vikki for their understanding and kindness. Unfortunately he doesn't have Vegemite. We certainly will be visiting Leos on our next Singapore stopover.Wayne & MaryAustrali
5
A visit to Leo Cafe is a must when in Singapore, the food is a mixture of Asian and Western cusine, and cooked to the highest standard by the irepressible Vicki. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the dining experience is second to none, would recommed to anyone who visits Singapore
5
cozy alfresco dining ambiance with friendly service staff. we ordered a few of their signature dishes and they were all very delicious. it's an awesome chill-out place with great affordable food!
would love to be back again!
5
Every dish cooked to perfection in this lovely little restaurant! Warm and friendly reception from the staff here, as always...we can't wait to go back again soon!! Thank you Leo, Vicky and girls x
5
Glad that I visited this restaurant when in Singapore! Delicious food and friendly service :) Will definitely go back again when I have the chance.
5
Leo cafe is a fantastic place if you like to have very good food in one of the best location in Singapore for a reasonable price. I'm happy I found this place
5
Dont miss leo cafe if you are in singapore. Great food and very nice owner. A pleasure, even when it rains :)
4
Enjoyed the terrace & delicious food of this nice & simple restaurant, as well as the kind service. I'll be back!
5
We spent two weeks in Singapore and dined at Leo Cafe most evenings.The food is excellent and a wide variety of meat, fish and vegetable dishes are offered.The atmosphere is very relaxed. The outdoor tables are nicely located in a peaceful area.The restaurant is family run and very welcoming. Vicky is a great cook whilst Mr Leo is a fantastic host, full of wonderful stories of how he has seen Singapore change over his life time.Will be back there next time we are in Singapore
5
What a great night once again at Leo Cafe!! The food was great and Leo, Vicky and the team as welcoming as ever. So relaxed and great value for money!!! The new menu is ab fab, great selection of new dishes, fresh fresh, fresh!!!Highly recommend this place to everyone.Thanks again to you all!! 
5
Have been to Leo's several times and it never disappoints. The relaxed terrace, the wonderfully hospitable Mr Leo, the always delicious food and reasonable prices keep bringing us back. A trip to Singapore is never complete without a visit to Mr Leo. Recommend the lamb cubes if you like a little spice!
5
Tiny restaurant with great atmosphere and sublime food. Asian and western dishes all good, especially the service of the family that runs the place is fantastic. Can advise to go there for a dinner with 2 or a group. Seated in a quiet courtyard lined with shophouses you will forget you're in a big hectic city
