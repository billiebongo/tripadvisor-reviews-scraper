We had a delicious Indian dinner after perusing all the stalls. If you are in the area or want a food centre near the MRT (Newton station), this is a very good option. Otherwise, there are nicer hawker markets.

Great experience, huge selection of different food, with beer👌 my kids ran a mock but everyone around us were very friendly
Loved it

Excellent atmosphere
Busy busy so much to choose
Excellent drinks service
Food service so so lady refused a picture said we d not ordered from her ( we had ) slight attitude
Food tasty
4
There are many shops which sell all kinds of food. We went for dinner and it was very crowded. It is bit difficult to get a table, so go early. Good experience. You can try different varieties of food.
4
If it walks, swims, flies or crawls it will be sold and eaten here. Not the same place as 30 years ago but still a great place to spend an hour or two filling your face.
5
Came to this place literally every day for a year, the range of food and its variety is unreal, a must visit for any tourist!

Have been eating here on each visit to Singapore over the last 30 years (back to the days when it was Newton Circus). It doesn't have the charm it did 30 years ago but I believe it is still the best hawker market in Singapore. As it is open air it is a lovely atmosphere to have great hawker food. Love the carrot cake, popiah, roti john, murtabak, satay etc etc. Definitely a must when in Singapore. We ate here every night we were in Singapore and will do so again next time we are in town

My husband and I were very keen on trying out a hawker centre, one of those very Singaporean food courts that offer the best street food at excellent prices. Asking at our hotel for recommendations, we were told to try the Newton Food Centre, not too far from Orchard Road, and one of the most popular around. Established in 1971 (when it brought together hundred or so hawkers who’d been playing their trade in various parts of Singapore), the Newton Food Centre is Singapore’s oldest hawker centre.Newton Food a Centre is spread out in a large quadrangle, its sides lined with stall after stall. The open corridors have plastic or wooden tables and chairs, and there are more of these in the large central area. We had the good luck to get a cab ride to Newton with a cabbie who was quite a foodie, and she gave us recommendations for what to order. Carrot cake, the white kind (which is salty, as opposed to the brown, which is sweet); satay (mutton or pork, not chicken, which is made with frozen meat rather than fresh); chilli crab; pepper crab if we wanted something spicy. We weren’t terribly hungry, so we ordered a white carrot cake from one stall (for S$5), a ten-skewer satay set (5 mutton skewers and 5 pork ones) from another stall for S$7, and a tall glass of sugarcane juice with lemon for S$2.50.The carrot cake—rather like a delicious, comforting omelette with batons of white radish in it—was very new to me, and very good. The satay was more familiar, though the sauce it came with was less peanutty and more oily than I’ve had before. Still nice, though, and the skewered meat was tasty enough in itself to be had without the sauce. The sugarcane juice was a little lacklustre, though refreshing enough. The next evening, since we’d liked our previous dinner at Newton so much, we again went to Newton. This time we decided to order chilli crab, and that too from Alliance Seafood (stall #27), which has received a special mention from Michelin for its quality. Our toddler wants noodles, so for her, from another hawker (outside whose stall we’d found a table), we ordered mixed noodles. (Do note that hawkers are not supposed to tout, and you aren’t obliged to order from a hawker just because you sit at a table outside their stall, since the tables are all communal). We also ordered a fresh watermelon juice. The chilli crab, for S$39 (the noodles were for S$6, the juice for 3), came in a massive plate, a great meaty crab swimming in a thick, delicious sauce that was more sweetish-salty than spicy. The crabmeat was very fresh and very good, and the little sweetish buns (six of them) that came alongside were great for mopping up the sauce. Messy, of course, but since there are sinks with soap dispensers dotted along the edge of the courtyard, this wasn’t a problem. The noodles—thick ones, tossed with vegetables (green beans, beansprouts, some corn, onion) egg and prawn—reminded me of the ‘Hakka noodles’ that are so popular a part of Indian Chinese food: similarity flavour and look. Good, but not exceptional.If you’re looking for authentic and good street food, Newton is a must-do

If you just order the local dishes in few dollars, it is still a good choice. If you would like to have seafood, please save your money and go to some recommended restaurants.Most of the stalls treat you as tourists. Even I ordered the coconut to drink, I get a small one in the same price as a big green one. But there are still some good stalls (around 10)......if you choose them luckily

Experienced the MRT train system with family of 6 (very organised and quick train system)at only $1.60 return from Clarke Quay. However food at Newton is not so cheap and for the price,we did expect better quality. Should have opted for a meal at ClarkeQuay, at least it’s cleaner, cheaper and better atmosphere. Definitely look around all the stalls first and observe what others are eating and where they bought. $45 for black pepper crab, more shell than meat, sauce was overwhelming and was only enough for 2 as a taster meal. Lady vendor very charming and we were sold on her, but food didn’t match. Won’t go bac
4
Had lunch here, very clean and tidy, lots to choose from, a little dearer than other food centres but good quality, plenty of it on the plate and a nice atmosphere. Very spacious. Convenient to MRT.
5
A must for visitors from abroad.
You sit outside and choose your food and your drinks from different shops - it is self service. Thus you have the chance to choose from different kitchens and you can eat a lot for really cheap money.

Before traveling to Singapore, we were advised to eat street food. Coming from the U.S., we were a little leary, but after asking a couple of locals, we were directed to Newton Food Center. On a Saturday night, it was hopping. We walked around and scoped out the many stalls, constantly being invited by ladies to choose the food from theirs. We ate from several stalls and had a grand time. What a great way to sample so many different cuisines. The highlight of my evening was finding authentic Chinese soup dumplings
4
We went on a rainy Saturday night and it was busy but you could get a seat easily even though the out door seating wasnâ€™t available because of the rain. Plenty of stalls to choose from but as we had been recommended Alliance Seafood for chilli crab we went there. The crab and sambal stingray were amazing. My son had a curry from one of the many Indian stalls and he was very happy also. A little bit of touting going on but if you politely decline they are not persistent.

Recommended by our transfer company and hotel concierge, we h ad to give this a try. Unpretentious food court built in a horseshoe shape with many food stores around the outside and tables sited both around the horseshoe under cover and in the middle of the courtyard in the open air. Full of locals and tourists alike when we arrived at 7.15pm and the atmosphere was fabulous. Don't go if you prefer your food served on china crockery and silver service because this is anything but. The hawkers are trying to get you to sit down to eat their food as soon as you walk past, but simply sit down and give your table number to the stall or stalls whose food you want. Such choice! Noodles, Indian, spring rolls, salted fish, stingrays, satay ... there seems to be nothing you can't find. Dress down, go with the flow and enjoy some authentic, inexpensive, freshly cooked to order dishes. We had a great meal and would love to return if we have tim
4
We had dinner here twice trying different stalls. There is really a lot of them to choose from! Some of us chose to eat Indian while others went for fish balls or sate. All of them were good and I followed recommendations of a guide to try the noodles from a famous stall in the outer circle. The hall is very lively and bustles with activity in the evening
4
There are quite a few stalls here and the choice is all yours. We had some sticks which were wonderful. Then followed this with some BBQ stingray. Our preference was the satay, but that is nothing against the stingray.There is a lot of seating and tables, but centre is quite busy so you may have to share a table with complete strangers. Nice way to chat with new people. Also very clean and tidy.This food centre is within walking distance of the Newton MRT station. No more than 200 meters and across a road bridge
1
My observation is that all seafood stalls in the Newton food court are selling shark fin soup. It is very unfortunate as Newton is one of the nice food courts. Lots of good food and nice atmosphere. My comment here shall not reflect on all the other stalls who are conducting their business responsibly. #shamesharkfinsou

Food Mecca indeed. Enjoyed spicy crab and clams with cold frosted beer. Food is reasonably priced and delivered to your table after ordering. I dont have pics on my tablet but it looked incredible. Fun way to eat some great tasting food. It gets messy but sinks are available for after all the good eats. Come on an empty stomach to fill up.
5
The title says it all...so much seafood here! Crabs, fish prawns, oysters, stingray etc plus some halal stalls as well. We came here mainly for the chilli crab and the sambal stingray and boy did they not disappoint. Sambal stingray and crab was drool-worthy. Lots of stalls to choose from, but i think most of them are of decent quality.Newton food centre is a clean open air & covered food stall that is fairly big in size. Our problem was choosing which stall to order our food from. And then we had a good tummy workout. The sambal stingray was my favourite (i am a little biased). Tender, juicy, meat with a fragrant spicy sauce...its probably one of my top dishes to have in singapore
2
Lost one day great atmosphere and became just another food court.
Food not good anymore; place very dirty. Old fish, smelling..
not recommended!!
5
All fresh food. Ordered grilled king prawn, oyster omllete, steamed shell , grilled chicken wings, satay. All GOOD
1
This is a notorious rip-off place.
Your think you are ordering 1 serve of 3 tiger prawns but get charged x 3
$54 for three tiger prawns. Co'mon
BE CAREFUL HERE

Visited here with family on recommendation from a friendly local. Definitely worth it. Very affordable selection of classic Singaporean dishes, we had the BBQ chicken wings, cockles and a very sizeable chilli crab. Ordered at one of the many stalls, the shop keep told us to go find a seat and the food will arrive soon. When I asked how they'd know where we are, he said confidently "Don't worry. We'll find you." I kept a reluctant eye on the stall but sure enough he delivered the food right to us not long after. Brilliant service! The food was generously portioned and delicious (and a bit messy, but a nice chilli crab eating kind of messy).Also recommended the BBQ stingray and oyster omelette, something I certainly look forward to trying on another trip.
4
Yummy typical singaporeans foods are here and they open late. We ordered sambal sting ray, kangkung, carrot cake and for drinks: barley and sugarcane with lemon. There's a lot of stalls, i wish i can try them all. Tips for tourist to check out price before you order. The only drawback is very hard to find taxi to go back home, so we walk and took the bus instead
4
One of the oldest and most famous food center in Singapore. It caters a lot to tourists and locals, as it is easily accessible from the nearby Newton MRT station. There are lots of different choices of Chinese, Malay and Indian food. The prices are a little high as they cater mainly to tourist
4
I went to Newton Food centre many years ago. It was a must to go back this time. There have been renovations but the atmosphere and food is still just as good. If you want to have chilly crab and don't want to pay huge prices, this is the place to have it. Sit with the locals and watch the world go by. It is really worth the visit. And try different things. Don't be put off my everyone trying to get you to sit at their eatery. Just pick which one and have a feast. You won't be disappointe

I had a late dinner earlier at Newton Food Centre, which has always been a favourite among both locals and tourists.It had been a while since I last ate here, and I had sudden craving to eat Laksa with cockles. That was my aim to go to Newton Food Centre. However, I soon found out that the stall which I used to frequent years back do not serve cockles any more, but chicken meat with laksa. In the end, I ordered the XO minced meat noodles which was a pleasant surprise . The cost of the bowl of XO Minced Meat Noodles is SGD4.50 (USD1 = SGD1.35), and it was very tasty. Love the noodles, and the minced meat. There were fish cakes, a meat ball, some lettuce, slices of mushrooms and some bean curd skin. I would give a rating of 8.5/10. Do try it if you head to Newton Food Centre.I will upload picture of the stall - XO Minced Meat Noodle, and the few other stalls selling quality food, which had won numerous culinary awards, or certificate of excellence.11 Hai Yen BBQ SEAFOODTry the BBQ Stingray, Cereal Prawns, Black Pepper Crab.Satay / PopiahTry our satay with a choice of different types of BBQ meat, and the Popiah, which is wrapped with ingredients of minced meat, vegetables, and gravy.Kwang HuatHokkien Fried NoodlesFried Kway Teow with cocklesYou will find the above stalls next to each other on the side facing the main road, and Cairnhill Community Centre.Nearest MRT Station is Newton, and it is only 5 minutes walk to the Newton Food Centre.
4
The food centre is walkable from Newton MTR Station, however, if you have any difficulty with walking etc., be aware that you have to cross a busy road by way of an elevated foot bridge with multiple steps up and then down. Only alternative seemed to be a long walk further up the road to a pedestrian crossing. A taxi would be a good alternative if you have mobility problems. Once there, multiple stalls offer a great choice of food styles and prices. It was raining, but there were plenty of undercover tables to choose from
3
Newton market is popular to both local and tourist.Lots of food stall selling from beer/sugarcane juice to noodle,soup,BBQ and steak.Most of the price are fixed and you can see in each food stalls except some seafood are per kg to remember to ask the price before you order.Recommend for Dinner and you have to wait to get table.I always bring my own bottle and enjoy Sambal Kangkong(fried morning glory with chili shrimp paste,BBQ stingray,oyster omelette,la la or chuk chuk.
4
if u come to newton food centre you need try baby squid, so nice eat that with Tiger Beer. come and try ur self :D
4
Easy to find as 2 mins walk from Newton station (NS21), looks a bit shabby but actually very clean and the vendor we bought from ( plot 78) was very fresh, good portions and good price..about 110 SGD between 3 with 3 large beers
2
We had a nice satay chicken but we went for a seafood to stall number 74 and man charge as $72 for 4 tiger prawns . Avoid ! Better go to restaurant.
5
Good food for seafood! Love the fried oyster egg. Must have food. Price only either u take the SGD6 or SGD4 plate. Cheap! Can’t remember the name of the stall but once u walked in, its on the left. A husband and wife stall. Price is reasonable. On overall we spend about SGD50. We had fried squid, grill fish, oyster, veggie, fried kuey teow.
5
Great place to taste lots of different types of SE Asian foods. Seafood, BBQ, Fred juices and anything in between.I like the place in the far corner, crispy pork belly, braised pork, stir fry pal choy, all yummy! Get some dim sum over on the other side.Good prices and nice sharing/family style opportunity. Lots of locals there so you know it’s good

On the advice of an expat local we headed to the Newton Food Centre/Hawker Centre for dinner on a Friday night. Fortunately we had been given advice on which restaurant to try, however there were so many to choose from. The whole Centre had a great vibe. Good cheap beers to wash down the spicy delicious foods we tasted. Conveniently located near Newton MRT. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed. We got their before 7 pm and didn't leave until after 11 and that was cause we needed to get the MRT back to our accommodation. In fact our friends went again the next night with other family and friends
5
BBQ Chicken Wings, BBQ Stingray, Pork and Lamb Satay, Stir Fried Kang Kung, Salted Egg Yolk Crabs, Garlic Tiger Prawns, Oyster Omelette, Fresh Coconut and Sugar Cane Juice with Lemon. The perfect dinner for 4 persons who are on a mission to OMNOMNOM local delights in Singapore. It's about a 5-10 mins taxi ride from Orchard Road and a great place for authentic local cuisine within the city centre. A must visit for those living near Orchard Road
4
I was on my way to Clarke Quay when a friend took a sudden detour to Newton Food Mall.At the outset the place doesn’t look appetising or hygienic but a walk around the place and the clean toilets, cooking and eating areas convinced me that the food would be good - it was!The food stalls have many different cuisines from Singaporean, Indian to Cantonese food and the prices are surprisingly affordable. Had a beer, noodles and deserts for 2 for under SGD50 (~$40) which is unbelievable in this part of the world!
3
To be fair this is a review of a single stall. But hey... that reflects on the whole place. Popped in Saturday lunchtime and went to Satay Popiah. All a bit average. $4.4 for two. Pretty average taste. Also despite being the only customer I thought I had offended the guy by ordering. He had to get up and do something. not great.
5
I’ve been there with my friends. There’s variety of seafood and some barbecue chicken wings. Seafood fresh and good price. Juice shop juices very fresh and goo taste. Environment is clean. We’ve ordered 6-7 dishes including 4/5 drinks it was around 50 something S$. I would love to go again
4
Excellent range of fresh local food, great vibe, great seafood, we went for the chilli crab (and prawns). There are so many options so I guess from other reviews that a lot depends who serves you. We were very well looked after.
5
Cheap local food and it's delicious an absolute must try. Too many options to choose from and it's really authentic.
5
Street food. But the place is relatively clean.
Go for chili crab with fried buns, grilled stingray, smoked chicken wings.
Accessible with wheelchairs, baby strollers.
Close to MRT.
Beers available.
Open till late night. Can go for late supper after night out.
4
Food is simple and available in a variety of choices covering all of south east Asia.
I like the chilly crab and the carrot cake but there is so much more available here....
Open late and plenty of cold beer to go around.
5
We came here after the Grand Prix meet Linda her and her family really liked after us. Daniel Riccardo is one if her regular customers. So funny. We really enjoyed ourselves.
3
We went to meet up for a trip and were surprised that the place is totally changed. Formerly, it is without roof top and the place is hot during day time. Now is covered with fans and the place is windy. The tables and chair is the same as normal food centers. Last time, the place is quite during day and only crowded at night. Now, day is also crowded. Ordered a coffee, sugar-cane drink & popiah to try out. It is just normal
5
Every visit to Singapore we return for fast and fresh local food with loads of choice. The white carrot cake is great. The Indian offering is always consistent. Lovely clean atmosphere with lots of fresh air. No stalls have napkins so take a packet of wipes with you. Cheap cheap eating. Family of 5 was full to the brim on $80 aud inc beers.
3
This place has been around for long, long time. Easy to get to by MRT, a station just a few minutes away. Food is good but cost have risen each time I go there. Satays ,sea food, chilli crab, fish, scallops, Chicken wings ,thighs, fresh vegetables ,lots of beer and fruit juices.A mixture of food styles,naturally Singaporean,Thai , Malaysian and Chinese. Usually a great buss and atmosphere, gets busy and some times hard to get a table near the vendor who you decide to purchase from, but they find your table number. You may be even ordering from 2 or 3 different vendors depending on your tastes or their specialties. Now consider some other site have better food, prices and appeal, but do it at least once
3
The first time I visited this place when it was then known as Newtons Circus was in Jan 1982. I have been visiting this place quite regularly almost most of the times when I visited Singapore.I have found this place was a good enthusiasts paradise once with a variety of stalls that served hot exotic Malaysian, Chinese, South Indian dishes as the ethnicity of the owners was a mixed race.Nasi Goreng, Crab, Sea food were some of the specialities that were available. Of late I have seen a gradual deterioration in the standards, taste and the hygiene.Dr. Javed Rashee
2
went for a late night local food dinner here as it was close yo my hotel. my food was so oily and i was charged at least double what was printed on the sogn borad, the man at the counter was unhelpful and would not budge on his stance. wont be back again
5
Hassan's Mutton Curry is well worth a try. Have it with a piece of fresh roti. Wash it down with a cold beer! What more could you want.
5
Lots of people eating at 10pm at night, so you know it's good. However, not everything has marked prices, so go with a local, otherwise you may pay a lot more than expected if it appears obvious you are a tourist.
4
The place is very clean. Food is really good and there's a lot of variety to choose. One of my favourite place to go whenever I'm in Singapore.
4
Great place to hang around with family and friends in the evening!
Recommended for families with children!
4
Review by Dr Sim. Good variety of food. More expensive than normal hawker centre as it is geared towards tourists. Mostly self service. Tourists can visit. Convenient location. Tourists can get there by MRT. Regards Dr Sim
4
Amazing open air food court. sEA food is a bit expensive. But overall a good experience. Offers Chinese, Indian, Malay and western food. Tried from different stalls. All new food items we tried were good. must visit.
4
I visited the place quite late in the evening. The food stalls were still in operational. This centre was worth to visit. The prices ranged from SG$3 to $8 on food, some higher if you put an order of crabs, mutton etc. The most money made came from drinks
5
)i, we ate at No 31 and no 70 .. both excellent.. pretty clean for street food and super tasty... no 31.... Always Awesome.. was just that.. we have satay chicken and spiced prawns.... great fun evening with lots of beers... ( would advise buying bottled beer as probably better quality than the on tap type!
4
A great place for dinner. Had Xinshi Lobster and Seafood Bee Hoon. The owner was pleasant to deal with and the portion was generous. We had some grilled fish as well from the neighbour stall. The owner was rather rude, to us and to other customers. Walk around before sitting down. Take a survey of whats there and try to ignore the sales pitch of the store owners..
4
Came here for a quick bite to eat before heading to the Night Safari. I had the chicken noodles from Kwee Heng, with my wife eating at Nasi Lemak. In total, including drinks it all came to about Â£10. Well worth the price. The noodles were fantastic, some of the best I've had in all my travels in Asia. The food centre itself is clean, with a large amount of seating. While the stall owners do try and get you to come eat at their stall, they're not pushy and a shake of the head gets them to leave you alone to peruse at your own pace. There are a good mix of locals and tourists here. Would definitely recommend a visit.
4
Had dinner here last Sunday night.
With family.
It was good value and enjoyed by all.
Probably over ordered.
The stingray and tiger prawns were probably the highlights. But they were HIGH lights.
A very pleasant meal
5
Take mrt and stop at the "newton station".This hawker centre/food court has a big variety of foods. Chinese,indian,arabic,fish,meat,vegetables,drinks. You choose your food and sit wherever you like. Try black pepper beef and drink lime juice.
3
One stop Hawker centre where you can get all the local delicacies from a - z and pack with tourist and the local.
5
This is a must go place if you are visiting Singapore . Also as one of the tourist spots, this place is an open area surrounded by small food stalls showcasing different cuisines of Singapore.My recommendations are chilli crab with mini sweet buns, sting ray fish, spicy bok choy and beers to go with them.Mark this place in your go to list when you are planning to pay a visit to Singapore
2
Normally such centre is perceived to be fresh and Cheap but to my surprise it was expensive and not fresh.One tiger prawn of around 3 Inches was priced at SGD 18. OMG. Even more expensive than popular restaurants. I ordered Butter Prawn and in the picture it was showing dry but when it was served it was with Curry paste and the heads were out of the body which means it was not fresh. Food was bad taste. Suggest you people to choose more carefully if at all you have to go to this centr
4
Went there after a years. Food selection is good and great variety of cuisines. We went for the seafood selection and the dishes were very good and fresh. Pepper crab 4 stars Stingray sambal 5 starsCereal prawns 4 stars Cockles 4 stars Clams sambal 4 stars Sambal fried rice 4 stars Great place for simple hawker style dining
3
Haven't been home in singapore for 5-6 months so popped in for a late dinner. It was 11pm and still pretty crowdedHad sugar cane juice and beer for beveragesHad carrot cake, fried hokkien noodles, and fried kway teow. The latter 2 from stall #01-24. Hokkien noodles ok, the other 2 blahDinner for 2 at $22, no major complains. Just don't order seafood unless you're planning to splurgeVentilation seems poorer compared to the last time i was here 2-3 years ago. Fumes everywher
5
Newton food court or locally called Newton Circus open late until 2 am to serve local delicacies for both tourist and locals for late night goers. Since, I have not been in Singapore for almost 2 years; I have missed many of their local dishes and needed to have them all. The Newton Circus served the needed. One can walk around and pick what they like and try small portions of many dishes. I ordered Otah, a ground fish cooked with coconut in the banana leaf, BBQ chicken wing and a small plate of Fried carrot cake. For the drink; in Singapore we must drink their local beer, Tiger. This time its offered with lemon squeeze. It worth trying, because the lime was refreshing for the hot and humid night
4
Nice spot, outdoor area, very busy. $7.50 long necks of tiger is a good deal. My red hot tip for good food is the stall simply named 27. Good guys, very honest, great crabs ($36), good buns, great fried rice.We had an excellent local taxi driver the day after & she asked where I bought my pepper crab, I told her 27 & she said "well done, this is where I take any family & visitors. Good score
4
Lots of different stalls of all kinds here open late or even all night make it a great stopping point either on your way or out of the CBD. The prices are a little higher than most places, as it does cater to tourists, so beware not to overpay! (I paid SGD15 for sweet and sour chicken on my first night)A good introduction to the Singaporean way of dining
4
Once you come inside the circle you'll feel the presence of mixed races and nationalities. Not mentioning the very wide variety of local and exquisite cuisines. Stall staff are friendly and courteous.
4
Visited this venue with friend in the evening on a weekday. It was relatively busy but there still was plenty of seating.We tried a variety of foods from different vendors with most vendors delivering the food to our table and with one taking pickup at their stall.There are clean toilets in this location
4
Tried the food from a few different hawker stands. All was good but not all of the stalls were open during the day. A few more of them were opening as we were leaving so I guess that the best time to visit is after 4.30pm. Lots of the hawker stands sold seafood and all of the stalls were clean and the food looked fresh. Overall a great place to grab some affordable food. Close to a MRT station
4
Busy easily accessed older style food court that is a great way to immerse yourself in the Singapore Food Court eating style. Well patronised by the locals which adds to its appeal. Well worth a visit to take a break from a busy days sight seein
4
The place is famous and for a reason. It is very cheap and you get good value out of the money. Don't expect fancy eating.. it is a good place to have lunch and get traditional food. I recommend looking for the places that have queues. Usually those are the best. It's close to the station so it's easy to get in and out
4
I would recommend this place for after dinner hours as there is a variety of options. Also the energy level is very high, and it can make you forget about your troubles for a while. Prices might be slightly higher than the standard Sg hawker fare, I guess it's alright after factoring in the fact that you can't get such a variety of hawker food in a centralized location after 930pm!
4
Group of 10 went after 9pm. It was in walking distance of where we were staying. It was still super busy. We had Indian, chicken rice, charsaw chicken and fruit juice. Everything was excellent tasting. At the Indian stall the owner even encouraged us to order less initially as the portions were larger and we could always order more if needed. Very helpful. Several of us even commented how clean the tables were even though it was such a busy evening. Very happy with the prices as well
3
We have now eaten here 4 nights in a row as it is the only local hawker centre to our accommodation. We have dined at multiple stalls and almost all has been delicious. The drinks vendors always have nice cold drinks whether you want juice or beer. The only down side are the inflated prices. This place is surrounded by high end apartment complexes and tourist accommodation. This coupled with the fact that there is little other competition may explain the high prices - like on average twice the price of other centres
3
Been there many times, but finally, I had to stop because I have to take care of my health and that of others who I take with me. The food is fresh and good quality food. Affordable rates. A variety of stalls to order from. But unlike most hawker centers I have tried, this is a place where they serve hot food in plastic and styrofoam containers/plates. Polystyrene foam cups contain styrene. In the 12th edition of its Report on Carcinogens, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) stated that styrene is “reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen,” and the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified styrene as a “possible human carcinogen.
3
This was a bit off the beaten path, unless of course, you happen to live or are staying in that particular area. We found that at lunch time, not too many stalls were open. The bbq skate was fine, but not worth the extra time it took to get there.
4
massive crowd and a lot of stalls with a big selection to choose from, noisy but enjoyable, the smell of food was great.
4
big hawker and lots of food options here, bit outer from the city centre easy to get to on the tube tho, it is worth visiting.
3
This place is open 24/7 & has a variety of options. It's nice to experience eating out at the whee hours.
Predominantly non vegetarian food but a few veg dishes can be tossed up on request.
5
A super hawker centre- many food options in addition to freshly squeezed juice. Prices are low given the competitiveness amongst vendors. I observed many local office workers coming here for lunch and reserving their place at a table by placing a packet of tissues at their seat before heading off to order. This centre is not touristy
5
From the moment i went into the center I know this is exactly what i want ! because is look seriously fresh, I chose the seafood stall call Jia Jia which is awesome decision! we have a sugar cane with lime juice and the chilli crab , some shell and some fried vegetable , the delicious satay ! the price is just nice ! we spent only around $S80 dollar for 3 person for Max foods

As one of the oldest hawker center, I was disappointed at the variety of stalls. If you want touristy seafood then this place is fine. If you want authentic Singaporean cuisine, stay on the outside, choices are limited. The drinks are bottled, nothing made fresh. Very disappointed. Last year, I went to Chinatown hawker center, better variety of Singaporean cuisine

Brought here by local friends . Have to say huge crowd here so obviously popular local spot. Lots of vendors offering their food from small outlets. Great variety of food. Big emphasis on seafood here. No problems getting a place to sit. I believe it is open 24hrs. We had bbq stingray delicious, calamari, king prawns, duck, mussels and pork . All were delicious. Plenty of beers . Bill for food came to about 55 us $ a steal in Singapore. Beers were cheap also. Definitely recommended for great night with local atmosphere.

As noisy as ever, but cleaner than before, and vendors aggressively trying to get you to sit at their stall has long been outlawed but still happens to an extent. Best dishes include the oyster omelette, bbq stingray, steamed or bbq cockles with spicy dipping sauce. Not just savoury food, there are a few dessert stalls too

This is an institution of Singapore and is very popular with the locals. We had lunch and I was amazed at the number of locals having their lunch which suggests the food must be OK. I suspect however that the quality varies depending on the shop chosen and the choice is huge and no doubt hard for a tourist to make. Nevertheless it's worth a visit for the colour and activities

As evidenced by other reviews, some folks like these venues while others do not. We visited the Newton Center since it is near our son's apartment and we enjoyed our evening very much. It was crowded but the area is clean and the locals are very friendly. Each of us ordered different dishes and everything was tasty and the prices were reasonable. This outdoor food court is worth visiting especially if you are in town for an extended stay and want to try new things
5
Love this place and come here every time I'm in Singapore. Great food, good location and heaps of range of delicious food and very cheap. Easy to get to via the mrt. One of the cleaner and hygienic hawkers too.
4
Good memories of this place from years ago promoted a return. Still has the atmosphere and great food. Take your time, order one dish at a time from different stall holders. Nice easy way to spend an hour or two with great local food.
5
A seafood lovers paradise for a down to earth everyday experience which is real value for money.Really enjoyed crab, oyster omelette and satay from multiple stalls rounded off with sugarcane juice.
Lovely to just sit and relax with friends on an easy informal evening!
1
The place is overly-hyped, it is just another food court which had good days but now it is overly commercialized and they haggle too much. When we ordered crab, they cheated on the weight and this is for food what Sim-Lim is for electronics - both are not worth it
4
It's been years since I visited Newton Food Centre, then a location where food touts were rather common. And while one might still encounter a tout from time to time (usually if you're rather unlucky), the renovation that was carried out a couple of years ago means the food centre is now much more spacious, has a more modern-look, and better washrooms. My most recent trip was for a get-together with some long-lost friends on a weeknight that coincided with a local public holiday. Crowds weren't as crazy as perhaps on a weekend but it was still fairly packed towards late-evening with mostly locals but also some foreigners. We were there more for the chit chat rather than for the food. Nevertheless, our seafood dinner was decent-to-good for taste, and while perhaps still a little on the pricey side, didn't come close to being ridiculously expensive
4
My wife and I visited the food centre yesterday as we had not been there for a while. The place was fairly crowded with locals and tourists patronizing the various food stalls. One is spoilt for choices here as there are stalls selling grilled seafood like squid, prawns, fish and chilly crab as well as oyster omelette which is our favorite dish. For this trip we headed for the fish soup stall which is located at the external side of the food centre facing the carpark. We ordered the fish soup with steamed white rice . Next to it is the fish ball noodle stall which is also run by the same operator. The fish we ate was fresh, tasty and nice . A very healthy dish indeed .We would highly recommend this stall .
2
After many years, went back with a group of friends for makan. At 12.30am the place is still buzzing.Many varieties of stalls selling mostly Chinese food. A few Indian and Malay stalls available but mediocre food quality.Food price are mostly overpriced but if you're hungry just got to go for it.Many tourists flock there to experience the nite life amidst locals .You're are better off going to other 24 hour Coffee shop available if you google.Not recommende

stall 31's chili crab was pretty amazing! Love the flavor and the sauce - it goes perfect with fried rice. We also had red bean ice (stall with the name 88) - it was just ok taste wise, but a good way to cool down. Overall, I recommend getting the crab
5
Eating hawker food can get incredibly hot. Luckily we went on a Thursday night after it rained heavily. The centre was not crowded and we were able to sit outside with a cool breeze. Our friend even brought a USB powered fan! Food was, well, hawker food. With cheap prices. There were tasty chicken wings, seafood, satay, etc. The only food I didn't like was the chicken rice.Centre is very close to MRT station. This point is important for those who know about the taxi situation in Singapore. As in sometimes it's just impossible to get a taxi 
4
Been here quite a couple of times, very easy to get there by MRT. You can get good local food there with reasonable prices (seafood can be expensive though). However, this food court is getting more and more touristy in the past 2 - 3 years and it may get difficult to find a seat. The only thing with this food centre is it is an outdoor food court and there is no air conditioning, it may get very hot and be aware of mosquitoes
5
If you're looking for tasty food with affordable price, Newton Food Centre is the perfect location. It's also near SMRT station & opens until late night.
3
We arrived at the place and had the feeling it might what we were looking for. Somehow we realised it is extremely touristic, still we sat down and ordered food. Food was tasty and good, nothing to say, service not to mention, but the price tag of this experience was surprising. You will not know the exact price before as they charge the crab and the fish per 100g but won't show you the amount before serving - extreme rip off potential. So we ended up paying with one coconut juice and one beer 80 sing$ which is around 60 us$. For street food and no service, sorry but no. Would avoid the are
5
Lived nearby so used to visit a lot. A LOT. Love stall #39. The owner used to see us so much that she didn't realize we moved out of the country cause we kept coming back for her food! Please note that if you see packs of tissues or wet naps on an empty table, it's taken.
4
if you don't know where to eat or what to eat. just try to go to this hawker centre. you can take mrt and alight at newton station take exit b. there was a lot of food to choose. seafood, laksa, mee, oyster, beer and etc. if you craving for seafood i thought that this place is cheaper than many restaurant. and the food was delicious. and don't forget to find your sit first, remember your seat number. order your food and mention your seat number. don't worry there was a lot wash basin to wash your hand. and try to find sit outsid
5
It has been a while since I have had chilli crab and ice cold beer, and to go to Newton and reacquaint myself with it was a real treat. I can still remember the old Newton, and the new tables, the multiple and very clean hand basins, and the other very good facilities made it all that more pleasant. Added to that a beautiful soft tropical night, good friends and the great table service even in a food court made it memorable.Certainly well worth the tri
4
Although the Newton Food Centre may lack the charm and esthetics of Singapore's Chinatown food street, Newton Food Centre has its own rustic charm, is cheaper and in our view, offers tastier food. Even though the variety of food may be less than in Chinatown's food street, it is considerably bigger. Well worth a visit
4
As eating experiences go this is right up there. The whole thing is a must do for a visitor. The p people are very friendly and even if you are unsure about what to eat they will advise you,spicy or not spicy. Watching the locals and what they eat is fascinating
5
Noe we`re talking food! Wonderful flavors, great variety and kine prices. Many food stalls gathered om one place, where you can order from more than one, then they come to the table with food and drinks.Authentic cuisine, with flavors that you do not get at touist restaurants. Looking forward to next visit.
5
We walked a bit to get to this restaurants and was totally worth it.You have plenty of options of really local and tasteful food at very reasonable prices.The only thing that bothered me a little was to pay cash to every shop when they deliver the food to your table. Touching money and food at the same time doesnt go well
5
We had seen several stalls featured on TV so were mean to try a couple of stand out dishes. We had the stingray and the chilli crab as well as a black and white carrot cake! All great. We were a little taken a back by the way service was organized but once explained we had a great time with some great beers. Go there it is great and the food is fab.
5
Great experience with reasonable priced street food and beer. Sat for more than a few hours drinking, eating Satay, Chili Crap, Stingray really good food and good atmosphere.
5
This a great place with excellent food and atmosphere. Go to the A or B stalls which ensure cleanliness if you are a Westerner worried about getting sick. Good cheaper food for Singapore. Prices a lot better.
4
We first visited Newton Food Center 25 years ago and still enjoy when in Singapore. The food, although expensive for street food, is still excellent value and always tastes amazing. There is a great choice and the service is good.
4
I love the environment of being out door in the evening with the local singing in a tent and FOOD, FOOD, FOOD with a very reasonable price.
4
I've eaten there a couple times. Don't hesitate if you are a foreigner , it's a clean place. If you're getting a lot of crab, you'll want to negotiate.
5
Newtons food centre has been greatly inproved since our last visit 4 years ago. The centre dining area has been fully paved instead of mud and grass, with many more tables.
The range of food is incredible and the value makes it a much-visit location
5
Great food! Highly recommended. Once you see 10 stalls, the rest offer the same food at the same price. The seafood at every stall is very fresh. Excellent chili seafood here. Great variety of fresh juices at only S$2. Also, very good snow cones. I recommend you come at night, it is not at hot and it is much pleasant
4
This was recommended by our waiter at the cafe in the botanical gardens. It is easy to get to from the MRT line and it has fantastic options for local cuisines. The outlets are graded from A-D for their health code practices. Prices range from SD$4-10, a bit more for fresh crab and seafood. Beer and other alcoholic sodas are available here. You can even buy a carton of beer if you want. Just be sure to clean up after yourself. There are food tray trolleys scattered around for diners to place their dirty dishes on. Cleaners bus these way to be washed and distributed back to the vendors but it is not looked favorably on if you just leave them on the table. Its a good system really.Smoke only in designated smoking sites.Try as much unusual foods as you can or taste your favorites done authentically Singaporean style 
4
The food or Hawkers centers are the locations to enjoy local and authentic cuisine, and Newton is very popular as there's a shopping center nearby .There very thing from durian to kway teow to new goreng and laska.There something for everyone to enjoy and love
4
We were in town for two days and met up with friends of friends who showed us around. They took us here and it is like an enormous food court with street food. So much to choose from. We had the oyster omelette and stingray and cereal prawns with a green vegetable. Delicious. Cash only. Very reasonabl
5
A bit of a walk from either MRT Station "close" to it, but worth the walk. Everything looks good, its very cheap and portions are big. the croissant there are softer than cotton, and very very tasty.
5
Fabulous food and atmosphere. Get the chilli crab and a beer and enjoy your evening eating outdoors. Great place to visit and eat - generally quite cheap and lots of friendly vendors to choose food from.
4
This place is nothing fancy, but the food is good, the beer is cold and price is cheap. From my perspective this place is a winner!
5
This is a must visit to Singapore. All the locals eat here so your guaranteed a good feed. Good prices on beer and food. The chilli crab from stall 31 was amazing. He even ran around to the drink stall to get us some more beers ;). We also had garlic prawns, pepper crab and satay chicken sticks, all really good and fresh.

Haven't been to this venue for several years since the Newton Hawker Centre was closed for renovation and reopened as Newton Food Centre. Instead of the previous open concept dotted by stalls, we felt fenced in by a ring of stalls, all eagerly awaiting our patronage. We were there for post-dinner taste test and many of the hawkers looked bored.It wasn't surprising since majority of the stalls were offering the same BBQ and grilled seafood. In between them were drink stalls and the occasional local Singaporean eats consisting of noodles or porridge. There was even craft beer at this venue! Newton Food Centre had certainly gone upmarket and the prices had gone up too.We finally settled on par-boiled cockles and whelk from Stall No. 2 and sambal stingray from Stall No. 70. The blood cockles were half cooked as ordered and the whelk was still soft and chewy, accompanied by a spicy belacan dip. The stingray was disappointingly bland. What little meat it had was covered by a light sambal sauce. We finally ended up ordering BBQ chicken wings from another stall which turned out to be a flavor disaster too. The food is not much to shout about but we still enjoyed having an late night eating venue that was close to an MRT station
5
Loved the Newton Food Centre. This lively food centre with its numerous stalls was fun and an intriguing place to visit. Loved the food which was good and varied. The Stalls have a rating. Look out for A and B ratings on each stall. Loved the atmosphere
4
Well on the face of it no ... But it really is an experience ... Food was good and the variation in styles is fantastic ... How they find you is amazing once you find a rare free table ... Good beer bargains but ask what's the best way to buy ...
5
I visited the food centre numerous times during my stay. It's a great place to eat but to also have a beer. If you want an Super Cold Tiger beer then than the husband and wife couple on stall 41 are simply the best. It was not only the best served beer in Singapore that I had but we were really looked after with free snacks, and a charming service. The satay are good as are the couple of Indian style stalls. It's great for late night food and drink and is open until 3am. Worth the trip out of the centre to visit
5
Got the train from Novena and was told to go here - so many options and choices and I'm sure all were good ! We had some amazing chili crab, prawns and Cangung veggies and cold tiger beer - a wonderful and pleasant experience for a very good price - can't wait to go again !
4
Great outdoor food court with many different stalls, which mainly focus on seafood. They all work together so the prices are aligned and you can just sit down anywhere and order at the table directly. Try the BBQ stingray with sambal kangkong, a delicious combo if you can handle it spicy.
4
If you are out there and tired of spending a fortune for lunch and dinner , this is the place . Offers many varieties. Not suitables for couples celebrating an anniversary :)
5
We love to go to Newton foodcourt for meal and family gathering and bonding. The food is Super and delicious and reasonable price. We love going to Newton foodcourt
4
If you ever visit Singapore, I would highly recommended having a meal at the Newton Food center. Shop no 43. Meet Michael.
The best hawker food in town. !!!
4
Worth visiting if you are staying locally, although it is right by the Newton MRT centre so access is easy. We have eaten twice at this centre and eaten very well. (Thai/seafood/Malaysian)
4
Went for some satay, prawns and a few drinks after we watched a movie. The place is same as it is. We sat near the entrance coz theres lesser crowd. I can say that this place is still a good one to go if you wanna just chill and have a feel of the local food and drinks. Prices are affordable and it taste good too. Another thing i love about Newton is its open til 5am. :
5
you should make time to visit singapores best food crntre the food is in one wordfantastic you name it they have it cooked to perfection.and you wont be over spendingon the food or drininks.ive taken friends and offered to pay if they didn't like the place or food.ive not paid yet.its a fantastic food centre

Visited after a friends recommendation and very glad I did. Close to the MRT station and easy to find, there is a lot of food to choose from at reasonable prices.I turned up about 6pm on a Sunday evening and the place was pretty busy. No trouble getting a seat though once I'd had a walk round to decide which stall to eat from (the hawker actually found me the seat).I used stall 23 (Takara) and I came here specifically to try Chilli Crab for the first time. He weighed the crab in front of me and the price was $5 per 100g, $40 in total for mine. Not expensive when compared to restaurants.Had to wait a while because they already had orders for a couple crabs but I enjoyed a large cold tiger (only $7) in the meantime.The crab arrived and I realised it was time to get messy, no implements here for crushing crab shell or extracting the meat other than chopsticks and your fingers & teeth!! The crab was delicious, I just had some steamed rice with it (which came free) and I was done.Loads more meat/seafood/veg to choose from if you don't fancy crab.Definitely recommend
4
Popped in here a couple of times now with chums. It's a vibrant, colourful place and reminds me of Hong Kong of the 1980's. Stall holders 'actively' seek your custom in a variety of ways but normally by thrusting a menu in your hand. You soon get used to moving on as you browse. There's a lot of places serving very similar food so competition is fierce. The food is hot, spicy and fresh. Had chilli Crab, squid, clams, sweet and sour chicken, long beans (excellent!) and a variety of rice dishes. Prices are very competitive too! Ice cold Tiger beer is never far away...
4
We are staying close by so naturally enough we had to visit due to its close proximity and great reputation. We were not disappointed. This is a permanent food market with stalls basically in a square around an open eating area with tables and chairs in the middle. We selected food from a number of stalls, selecting duck, bok choy , fried rice and dumplings. Beer and drinks also available. This is affordable and a great place to watch people and families, locals and tourists, all enjoying their varied meals.
3
As per title. Bought a small grilled stingray ($12), black bean dish ($15), fried rice ($5) and grilled prawns ($26). Explored Singapore days later and found out that we got massively ripped off. Prices are shown on menus so everyone gets the same price but if you go into local joints you can get much cheaper and much better quality. Grilled stingray wasnt very tasty and the black bean dish is $5 in Sydney Westfield foodcourts. This place is definitely targeted for tourists, not locals. Locals know better. Place is easy to get to by MRT but dont go too late at night - MRTs stop at 12am. Or get a cab
4
You'd come across edge-to-edge shops selling a similar combination of dishes. Lots of options though. You'd see an odd Indian restaurant in between, selling really tasty meat dishes.
Good for a first time visit.
5
Being a mexican guy over in Asia, I was really amazed the variety of food they serve. I can live there. specialty: PRAWNS.
5
This is a food center or food court located at open space. There are variety of local foods and seafoods. This is one of the great place to enjoy seafood at reasonable price.
4
The staff at our hotel told us about this place for great street food and they were right.I don't really like crab but the chili crab here is possibly the best thing I've ever had in my life.The duck with noodles was also good
4
Came to the food center lunch on our first day of our trip. Information at the beginning here is wrong, they definitely are open for lunch-just not all the stalls. It was raining cats and dogs, but we found comfortable dry seating under an overhang and I cannot recommend stall 01-12 more! The hokkien popiah is amazing
5
My wife and I wanted to try a Hawker Centre, and we picked the Newton Food Centre.It is an easy walk from the Newton SMRT metro stop.There are lots of different choices of cuisine, ranging from Chicken Rice (local version of Hainanese chicken rice), various other Chinese cuisines, Indian Food, Malay Food, and a Chinese Char Sui BBQ Pork place.I recommend you do a circuit of all the food stalls before you decide what to order. Then stake out a table and note the table number. Go back to the the food stalls that made you salivate and order, giving them your table number. You can order foods from many stalls on the same visit.We ended up with a fusion meal of Indian and Chinese food. My first problem was that my beer was warm. Some of the beer stalls advertise that they have the coldest beer, I recommend that you feel the beer bottle before you take delivery.My second problem was that there were more food stalls than I could sample in one visit. If I go back I will try the Char Sui place, and find a colder beer.The food is cheap for Singapore
4
I'm an expat living very close to Newton so this is probably somewhat biased, but for a genuine hawker experience close to Central Singapore you can't go wrong at Newton Food Centre (also known as 'Newton Circus" - which is actually the roundabout next to it).Other Hawker centres will offer cheaper and often better food and drinks, but for the convenience of Newton near the CBD and Orchard Road shopping belt you can't go wrong. There is a good selection of food including the popular chilli crab, as well as all sorts of noodles, local deserts and halal selections. There are also Thai & Indian options. Singapore sometimes gets a bad rap for the cost of food & drinks, but this is where its Hawkers are the great revellers. Food at Hawkers is much cheaper than most restaurants (just be sure to agree on the price of any seafood when ordering), and its possible to order large bottles of beers for $7-8, compared to $12-15 for a pint at most bars.It's a great opportunity to sit and enjoy the warmer weather, rubbing shoulders with locals, expats and tourists alike. Just a word of warning - don't wear your best clothes, as it can get quite smoky with the BBQ sambal smell, so its possible to end up smelling like a chilli crab when you leave
4
I went here years ago with some locals and came with my Wife this time. I am 6'3" and 115kg so they must have seen dollar signs when we waked in. Everyone had a table for me. Do the walk around and then grab what you want. It's always busy and a bit of a buzz. Not a spot for a quiet dinner but great for some local food the way the local eat it.Just one SMRT stop past Orchard
4
I always enjoy coming here for my Chili crab and seafood. The place is hawker stile, and they have good variety of seafood. The prize are quite high, but compare to restaurant, it is much cheaper and the taste is yummy. We ordered chili crab, steam fish, cereal prawn and rice. The barbeque stingray is also good. You eat mainly with your hand, you are given chopstick and plastic spoon and boy it was good and satisfying
5
We head to Newton Food Centre every time we are in Singapore and have been doing so since the late 1980s, although it has had several renovations since then. Can highly recommend the roti john, murtabek, fried rice (stall 79 are great) and popiah. The beer is also nice and cold too (can't be stall 77). Ate here 5 out of the 7 nights in Singapore - always a pleasure
3
The foods were good for seafood but not exceptional. However I consider the price a bit expensive for hawker place standard and I found the sellers were kind of aggressive but not overwhelming. Plus point is there are some Halal food stalls there!
3
Lost one day great atmosphere and became just another food court.
Food is good but place very dirty. Prices are ok.
4
This hawker centre is one of the more famous food centre here in singapore. There is a wide selection of good local food but initially, this hawker centre is known for its BBQ seafood like BBQ stingray and sotong. A good place to "taste" singapore!
3
Lots of choice for local dishes, however a little pricey, meant for tourist. Outdoor dining, can be warm. A variety of Chinese, Indian, Malay, Seafood, Satay, Noodles
4
Be prepared for crowds because this amazing food centre attracts lots and lots of people! Having eaten there you can certainly understand why... the food might not be the cheapest but there is something for everyone!Very friendly family oriented place to chat, relax and eat..
2
Food quality is really quite poor : stingray was old & smelly , sambal was straight out of a bottle ; vegetables were old & woody ; satay was mediocre etc etcVery very expensiveFar better places to eat in Singapore than this tourist tra
4
I came here twice. i like the hawker center here because it is spacious. However, the price of the food may vary especially seafood. Ask for the price before you order. Some of the hawkers owner or staff will try to increase the price ridiculously.I ordered a sting ray cost sgd12. Another shop quote me for a smaller sting ray for sgd 25. Another shop quoted me for a slightly bigger sting ray for sgd36.The chicken wings and satays here are nice
4
The Newton Circus (Old name) or Newton Food Centre is truly one of a kind. Best place to simply a wide variety of Asian, Indonesian, Chinese, Singaporean, Malaysian foods to see what you like. Suggest you bring a local person or expat to help with the selection of the better food stalls and also foods. Due to heavy traffic and potential overpricing now with the popularity of this site, sometime better to learn what you like and buy elsewhere. But a wonderful place to sample the wide variety of foods available in Singapore.We lived very near Newton Circus in the mid nineties for almost three years and used to take friends and family...before it got so busy. Started in the early 1970s and went through a substantial rebuilding in the mid 2005 time frame. Totally a wonderful experience
4
My wife, two children and I visited the Newton Food Center in June 2016. It is near the Newton MRT stop. The Newton Food Center stays open very late past midnight. We were not that hungry and just wanted to see it and walk around. We ended up have a drink that was like chocolate milk. If you are hungry, I think you can walk around and see a wide array of choices
5
This place is very crowded but you can easily get a table there. There are a lot of restaurants/food kiosk for you to choose which I really like it. I ordered seafood and some local noodles which the tatse of food were okay-great and the price is acceptable 
4
Local food, mostly locals and some tourists. Different types of food not fancy or up scale, but all looks good, and it was hard to choose. Very clean tables and food vendors prep areas. Prices are very reasonable. Definitely a place to visit.
5
I keep coming back here for the seafood. not the cheapest food center in Singapore by a long way but it has the best selection of stalls. Find a stall that is friendly (not pushy)
5
We visited the Newton Food Centre on a Sunday night and after walking around we headed to Denmark Seafood. It was absolutely delicious, we had the BBQ stingray, fried rice, prawns, and Brocoli with oyster sauce. Was about $90SGD in total and was way too much food for 2 peeps! Definitely recommend but don't forget your eyes are bigger than your stomach ;)
3
With endless food options in Singapore, Newton Food Centre feels pretty mediocre. As with any other hawker centre (aka food courts), Newton has plenty of seating, a decent variety of food, and prices are pretty standard. It’s outdoor seating, so it might not be the first place I’d choose if it’s raining or if it’s sweltering - just a thought. I just don't like hawker centres ha
3
The last time I was here, it was getting dirty and old but the place has been renovated and looks better and cleaner now. The prices, tho lower, are still not cheap. It's just a little hard to decide when the hawkers are all over you battling each other for customers. It can get irritating at some point
3
When I worked in Singapore in the late 80s I often used this food market and thought that both the food and the prices were reasonable .Returning this time whilst the food was still reasonable I considered the prices were high .A basic meal for two ,a beer and a coke were 85 Sing $ (plus taxis there and back )To be fair part of my feeling the prices were high was due to my currency (British pound )having lost about %13 over the last 6 months .I found Singapore in general to be very expensive which was a reflection of their high cost of living 
4
The food centre has been newly renovated and it looks nice and clean. Plenty of seating. the hawkers are very much in your face though, which is really annoying. They harass you from the moment you enter. There are lots of stalls and you are really spoiled for choice. Lots of seafood stalls. We had food from different stalls, it all tasted really nice. The food from the Thai stall was tasty, however, very expensive! 12 $ for pineapple fried rice and 8 $ for a small plate of mixed veggies is just overpriced for a hawker I feel. But all in all a nice experience, very crowded on a Saturday night. Lots of tourists/expats as well. Convenient location, only a short walk from the MRT downtown line. Definitely going to be back regularly, lots of stalls to try
4
Love the Newton Food Centre, it is a must for us on every trip to Singapore, for fantastic Satay, and delicious Chilli crab it has it all, to be washed down with an ice cold Tiger. Vendors can be a little pushy but if you are after some local food that isn't watered down for the tourists than this is the place to be
5
Visited here last night , after 25 years it has changed but for the better . Massive choice of goods , we tried stall 39 the lady with the big hair as recommended on tripadvisor . We had Tiger prawns that were huge and very tasty . We had about 5 dishes and a very reasonable large Tiger beer ( 7 Singapore dollars ) the food came to £46 which was very reasonable . Brought back some great memories .Well worth a visit
4
This place has been here for a long time and there is a reason for that. It is a popular place for visitors and locals and harks back to the good old days. It is a large place with a lot of choices. There are hawkers pushing you to their place but they are generally cheerful and well intentioned. Just remember to go where you want and order what you want. Unless you want to take their suggestions of course. You may end up with more than you need though. It can be a fun meal though so enjoy the experience. It is worth the visit
4
An outdoor food centre with many different outlets normally very busy and the food is good and varied it is a hawker style place clean and very vibrant well worth a stop
4
Haven been frequenting this place for quite some time now. Though I always complain that the food here is kind of expensive for Hawker food, the fact remains that the quality of food here is fantastic. Firstly, the Thai food stall (should be the only one there) is seriously great. I love their pineapple fried rice and the tom yum soup which always have fresh tasting prawns inside (though the squid begs to defer). Prices are around 5-7$ per dish.Next up is the BBQ chicken wings which u can order from any stall (I ordered mine nearer to the Thai food stall). Sweet and juicy wings awaits you with the soft scent and crisp of the slightly charred skin of the chicken wings. Yumssss Just TOP them off with any sugar cane drinks around and You will have a wonderful meal.
3
I used to visit this place many years ago. It was always fun with good, cheap food but a bit grubby. Now it has been cleaned up but the style is still "street food" although not so cheap as in the old days. Best for eating as a group - find a table, take note of the table number and send people off to the many outlets to buy variously dishes. They will be delivered to your table. It all works remarkably well. Only word of advice: if any menu shows a price per weight ($10/100g for instance) then make sure you agree the price before eating the food. These items are usually the most expensive on the menu.

I had dinner at this place last Friday. Before that, the last time I ate in this place was about 12-15 years ago. It used to have a bad reputation: rude and dishonest stall owners who grossly overprice their dishes or pad the bill of unsuspecting tourists and locals, unsanity conditions, etc.. That's why I stopped visiting the place for 12-15 years. The government have since renovated the place. The tables are farther away from each other, so there is more space, the toilets are kept clean, and it seems that the government regulatory body has put the fear of God in the stall owners - they now have published prices in the menu, and they are more customer-friendly now. But to be safe, please ask them for the prices before you order, and check your bill for accuracy. Just in case.It is a good place to chill and hang-out with friends, there is ample parking space, easily accessible via bus or MRT or even at a walking distance from Orchard Road (the main strip). They serve beer below zero (really chilled beer) which goes well with any of the local cuisine

if you love hawker hut type food then this place is definitely worth visiting. There are many stalls offering a variety of Singapore/Malaysian fare. We loved the atmosphere and the friendly, efficient staff. The oyster omelette was great. Really enjoyed the seafood hut, which offered a variety of fresh seafood dishes. If seafood is not your thing, don't worry as there are many other stalls to cater for most tastes

Singapore know for the modern happening city it is still has its authentic spots.This is one, you eat finger licking food for a few dollars. Fresh seafood, nice satay all the reall local foodis offered and as said fresh and cheap.If you havent been here you havent been to Singapor
4
Singapore is known for its hawker centers and we're always up for trying a new one. Newton was on the way back to our hotel and was definitely worth the stop. We had satay, seafood fried rice, absolutely delicious French beans and Kang Kung, spring rolls, and lime juice. The food was delicious, especially the vegetable dishes. We would absolutely go back to this hawker again
5
We had the 'carrot cake' from Mr Heng at stall 28 which is on fact an omelette with prawns and radish, so don't expect Nanna's iced cake from your youth. Mr Heng made a delicious dish and we could have eaten another serve to share but it would have been gluttony. Ample size, subtle flavours, all for spicy if you dare. Really good facilities here but don't forget to grab a handful of toilet paper from the dispenser on the way in as the stalls have none
5
We went here on the first day of arrival in Singapore. We were looking for traditional Singaporean food and asked our room service guy for a suggestion and he suggested this place! Amazing recommendation I must say! This is pretty much an outdoors food court with many food stands with tables in the centre. Almost everything I ate here was good that we even came back for a second time! I highly recommend the hainanese chicken laksa noodle soup on the outer food stands! It was very flavourful, rich, and creamy! For drinks, if you want something refreshing, try the fresh lime juice. The second day we came here, it was raining but we were still covered, just the centre tables weren't covered. I would come back to Singapore to eat here considering the hotel foods were unauthentic and overpriced. It's reasonably priced here (especially for Singapore)
5
I like to visit this food centre as many Halal hawker foods. In term of pricing is so so but for sure cheaper compare in food hall Orchard Area. I visited here with group of family, pretty good to get there together and having dinner there. Somehow, you should be clever to see some free tables for group family to sitting together
5
We had Chilli Crab here and it was fantastic! It went down very well with a few beers as it was very hot. Lots of locals eating here which is a good sign!
5
I think the food was pretty affordable tho lau pa sat is cheaper (slightly?). There were lots of food and I tried chili crabs there. It was good deal. The place itself was good especially if you came with friends. Super nice
4
Newton Food Centre is alot like Lau pa Sat. It's notably smaller. It's still very good food! Ice Kachang is to die for here, be sure to try it!
5
You will find a great variety of good food at Newtons. While its not very central to things, it's worth a special trip there. We got off the MRT on the way to the night zoo. The atmosphere is very relaxed. It's in the open air with some tables under cover. The food is great value
4
We were told about this place while we were doing a day of shopping, and have to say we were glad we decided to listen. The food is great and you can get a big bottle of beer for only $7! That's the cheapest I've seen in Singapore. There's a lot to choose from, so if you're looking for great variety for dinner, this is the place to go.
4
This is a kind of large open food court. You can find a large range of variety of local food for regular prices. Of course it is a informal place but you can eat with wine if you want..they offer every kind of beverage. I tried a Tiger prawns and were amazing. This a very convenience place if you spend all walking around the city or doing shopping and don't realize about time. Restaurants usually close around 10 or 10:30 pm and this place is open until 4 am!!
5
We had a most enjoyable experience at this food centre that serves the best of Singapore local fare. Even thought its a simple food centre, we received excellent service and smiles from the stores we ordered from. We recommend the BBQ seafood (stingray, prawns etc.), satay, popiah, fried carrot cake, prawn noodle. If we only had more tummy space! A must-try for all visitors
5
A very large food square were it is difficult to choose from the very many, close to a hundred, small restaurants. Plenty of seating in the open air or with small covers and a fan. Looking at the displayed seafoods on ice that looked good in many of the restaurants we almost randomly choose stall 78 called Hai Kee seafoods and that was a good choice. The chili crab was very good but the pepper crab even better. But, the large prawns with chili sauce were also excellent. Plenty of other choices such as good vegetables. We need to get back to try the clams and snails. Cold beers and cold coconuts are at the neighbor and served at your table.
4
This food centre provides plenty of variety of Asian dishes. Delicious food and very fresh produce. Plenty of seafood choices and many pork and chicken dishes. BBQ stingray is a must try for the adventurous eaters, the texture is not what you expect and it doesn't taste fishy, it's delicious. Lemon chicken was also tasty and is a safe bet for those a little less adventurous.
5
Newton Food Centre has a very vibrant atmosphere and there is a lot more outdoor seating (than Old Airport Rd or Lau Par Sat). Even though it was a hot night, there are heaps of fans to cool us down.If you are looking for lots of seafood, satay, oyster omelette options, then this is the place for you. The Chilli Crab and La La (pippis) at Sheng Da BBQ Seafood (stall 2) were both delicious ... just tell them your spice level, pay and they'll deliver to your table.The Oyster Omelette at Hup Kee (stall 73) was a standout as were the Ice Kacang and Grass Jelly from Shan Ren (stall 5).And the beers are very cold here!!My only disappointment was there was only one Congee vendor which wasn't open for business the night we were there and there were no Claypot Rice vendors, hence my suggestion that this is more of a Singaporean & Malaysian biased centre. If you are looking for more HK style food vendors, go to Old Airport Road
4
Family love this place. The open layout means they can scatter in all directions to pick up their favourites. Beware seafood here is pricy so best choose other dishes.
4
Newly renovated and everything was really nice🌱. The food are great but this centre is not good for rainy season.

I first came here in 1973 during a brief stopover in Singapore on my way to more distant lands. If I recall correctly, this was then called Newton Circus. I remember sitting down at an al fresco table and eating a plate of chili crab from one of the stalls, mainly with my fingers and making an incredible mess of myself.It was first opened in 1971 and was promoted by the Singapore Tourism Board as a tourist attraction for trying various Singaporean dishes. It was closed in 2005 for renovation and was reopened the next year.On this visit, I did not have the sense of the excitement I felt in 1973 at visiting such an exotic venue to eat such exotic food. Much older and perhaps with weary taste buds, I think Newton Food Centre is now a tourist trap and you can eat far better food at far cheaper prices if you do a little research beforehand
5
Were recommended this food centre by a friend of ours. Conveniently located right next to Newton MRT Station. It was overcrowded during dinner time and it was a bit hard to find a table. There were plenty of stalls to choose. We ordered BBQ stingray with sambal sauce, bak kuh teh soup, pork satay, rice with BBQ pork, and ice kacang. All of them were very tasty (except the rice which was quite dry). Service was fast and good. Price was a bit higher than other food centre as tourists were flooding it I guess
5
We loved the outdoor atmosphere and the huge amount of choice at this place. While the seafood was quite expensive the beef, chicken, noodle etc dishes were all reasonably priced and the outdoor dining was very enjoyable.Based on earlier reviews we read we expected to be swarmed by hawkers but it was not at all like that, if anything it was extremely laid back and until we walked up to the stores themselves we weren't even spoken to by any hawkers.Great atmosphere would definitely recommend
5
We think this is the best food centre in Singapore for many reasons although out of the main city centre it doesn't attract as many tourists as the Maxwell food centre for instance. We have visited this place on previous trips to the city and it seems to be used more by locals than visitors. There are Europeans and others non-Asians there but they looked like groups and families who were living in the city rather than passing through. The court is open-air and cool if a breeze gets up....occasionally. The food is excellent as it probably is at most other hawker centres but it seems more laid back here and less frenetic. Short walk from the MRT station. Take the time to visit. You will enjoy
4
Vast array of food on offer from vendors who are eager for your business but not too pushy. Plenty of tables were available around 6.30pm on a Sunday night. A good way to eat great food at bargain prices, providing you are OK with the heat and the absence of wine
4
Old Newtons Circus food place you could get turtle, frogs by the bucket, snake, marine iguana etc for a couple of dollars. Nice to see we could still get something different and still tasty in stingray. Even though they still have a stall selling frogs, they don't cook it like they used to.Nice food and fun people around, go see the lady who sells coldest Tiger beer in town and I do mean the coldest
5
Although this is now truly a tourist destination, what strikes you is how many Asian people eat there... A sure sign that the food is great. The venue is clean, friendly and always with a spare table, and there is so much choice of Singaporean food. Our favourite: the satays (some are great, others are sublime, so do try different vendors). One of the satay vendors had a newspaper review and his satays were the least good... so don't even let reviews sway you. Since you can buy 6 satays at a time, I'd do tasters, trying at least two different stalls, if not more. And try all the meats ( beef, chicken and mutton) because they're all wonderfully tender and tasty.
4
Newly renovated, brighter and more airy. Still the same stalls of halal BBQ seafood enjoyed by local and different nationalities of tourists. I'm here for the 'Heng' oyster omelette and fried carrot (actually radish) cake. The queue was so long that I had to wait for more than 30mins. It's all worth it
5
Really nice experience and food here.We absolutely love it and we will be back for more. Try the satays and seafoods.Super enjoy!
2
food is too pricey and sometimes they will rip u off if they know u r a tourist... they will also change the lobster or crab to a smaller piece after weighing the original one. beware of cheats here! change to lau pa sat better!
2
Food range is so so only. Bit pricy. Not as clean as before. Will make another trip to try out the food in the evening. Location wise is good with the MRT close by
5
Singapore is a fairly clean city, but I can't say that in most of their food centers, which are usually dirty (in my standard and I'm not anywhere near a neat freak) and humid. I believe this food center had been refurbished recently. The dining environment (outdoor only) is pleasant and clean.We came here for crab and didn't know which stall to choose, as there are more than 10 selling crabs and seafood. We picked a random one and that didn't disappoint us.Crab here is fresh and much cheaper than those in the restaurant (~40% cheaper). Crab on the day was $50 a kg compared to $80 + 10% services charge at No Signboard. Most importantly, the one at Newton taste just as nice. Location is also very good, 1 train stop or $5 taxi ride away from Orchard
4
Have been here three times in the last month all for late lunches. I am not sure how many of the food stalls are usually open at night but perhaps there were less than half of them open each time I went. However, there is still so many choices, I'm not complaining, not when I can have an ice cold Kopi peng for $1.50, an amazing mango snow dessert and a brilliant duck noodles with popiah to start. Sorry I can't give a rundown on the seafood, I'm not a fan but there's plenty to be had. The food has been very good each time, definitely a cut above other hawker centres that I've been to here. Newton's pleasant surroundings (plus fans) and clean toilets are also added attractions so definitely a must for anyone passing through being so close to Orchard Road. Just keep in mind when reading reviews about hawker/food centres in Singapore, that they should not be compared to cafe or restaurant quality. It's cheap, fun, outdoor (but under cover) eating and each stall specialises in a few dishes. I think that gets forgotten. I'm a fan of this place and hope you enjoy it too
4
There are a number of traders here all competing for trade. We chose the one with good attitude beside the craft beer stand. Tables have numbers and you can buy from any - they deliver to your table. But we decided to let trader 70 do the running around for us - she supplied from her stand where she could and went to others for the things she didn't have. She was a good host. Food was tasty. Price was reasonable. Portions were a large

Newton Food Centre does what it says, food is pretty ok if pushed at you more than most people would like, and I wouldn't like to say if all prices are fair having little to compare them with.I was however more than impressed with Yong at On Tap. A hand crafted brewery which doesn't tout for business and doesn't need to as the products that I've tried speak for themselves (Pilsner, English bitter). OK, not the best on the planet, but the best I've had in Singapore. What I really admire though is that newly wed Yong works as a waiter during the day but is trying his best to control his own future via the business of On Tap. The man himself is a pleasure to talk to and I'm firmly of the opinion that enterprises such as this should be supported, so give it a try! Good luck Yong
1
It is a mystery to me why this poop-hole is popular. The food is frankly sub-par and overpriced, the hawkers grouchy and the ambience downright unhygienic. Moreover, the food is served on styrofoam (proven carcinogen and ecological napalm). Tourists, flock to Maxwell food centre instead if you want a dose of third world charm. My advice would be to simply head for any of the sanitised food courts in any shopping mall - better variety, better price and superior food compared to this joke of a hawker centre
1
The in-your-face and extremely rude and stealthy behaviour of the hawker vendors gives this place a bad name. From the moment you enter you become the target of a group of extremely desperate and competitive stealthy hawker owners who will use all tactics in the book to get you to order from their stall. This includes coming right up to your ear and continuously yelling directly into it until you respond! Also beware of the seafood stalls' pricing. Some of the large prawns can end up costing you more than $30-$40 EACH. Bill shock when you order 5-6 prawns for your group. Lots of cheats here. If you are not careful you will end up spending way more than what you bargained for. Also worth mentioning is the lack of general cleanliness. After a couple of consistently bad experiences I never go here, and never take any overseas visitors either. It is not worth it
5
This is a food court type place where different stores offer different food type. There are many repetitions and you can pick and choose. You first settle yourself at a table. Each table is numbered. You then approach each store you like and order your food from them telling them your table number. They will deliver your food when it is ready. They will tell you at time of order if there is a long wait. so you have an idea and decide if you really want to wait or head to another one. Good experience. This place is quite busy until late at night.
4
I love Newton food centre. It is one of the most famous and oldest food courts in the city centre. I´ve been coming here since i was a kid and try to return when i can. the stingray, mee goreng and kaolin are my faves.
4
this place is probably the best start for a food tour in singapore, good street food cooked in clean kitchens and a lot of flavours!
5
Always come here everytime i go to Singapore. Many food choices to choose from. There's a lot of foodstall that served halal food. Cockles, fried rice, murtabak & satay and also Milo Dinosaur are my favorite. The price is also cheap. Recommended
4
A clean and cheep place to have lunch with a large variety of choices. The braised duck was delicious. Fresh juices are available.
2
While there are many stalls, the variety is dismal. Tourists should look elsewhere for good eats. Quality is patchy. This dinner was courtesy of Jian Fa Seafood. Absolutely a letdown.
3
As a local, I seldom come to this place as the price and quality does not match.
I can find better, more authentic and cheaper local food everywhere.
4
I went with 3 colleagues to eat at the centre. They have been there before, so I just came for the ride. I loved the see food, HUGE prawns, sting ray and delicious veggies- DO NOT order the chilli if you cant handle spicy- it's VERY HOT!!!!
5
Based on my last visit, I knew that I was never gonna go back to Lau Pa Sat. While the architecture is always good to see, the food has become more expensive and the place, quite touristy. Makansutra Gluttons Bay has also become very touristy and with limited choices. Thus, I asked my son who is based in Singapore (he's on his 5th year of stay there) to take me to a good hawkers' center. He took me to Newton. Perfect. Place was teeming with people (which is a good indication that it is ok) and the food choices are more varied. We got oyster omelette (that ecstatic feeling when it glides on your tongue), prawns with egg sauce (you can scoop up the sauce and take it), chili crab (with mantou of course) and stingray. Excellent choices. There were four of us. It was my son's treat and for SGD100 (or a little over), it was definitely reasonable. I will go back to Newton for dinner on my next Singapore visit
5
What can I say, Newton Food Centre is such a fixture in my growing up years. It has got food from many continents. Certainly will be spoilt for choice. The place is clean and the tables are well spread out. This time around, I didn't see as many hawkers hounding us as we were looking for seats. In the past, we would have been surrounded by vendors asking if we want to place orders with their stalls. Strangely, this time around we were left pretty much alone to ponder our choices. Certainly welcomed this change. Finally, we settled on Nans, Roti Pratas, Satays and fishball noodles. It was a satisfying and quick meal. I'd be back
4
Is a good place with all the common food and drinks option. All the time delicious, tasty and fresh food. But since one of the most famous food courts it has developed quite high prices. It did undergo a renovation early 2016 and has re-opened in April. Much much better, nicer and cleaner than before. But still expensive.
3
You can get many different kinds of Mayal-Chinese foods here. The quality is not the finest but it is authentic and filled with locals and a few westerners. Don't miss the other side where the desserts are. Have an ice kechang.
5
I like the sup tulang and nasi briyani here. It is near the Newton station and bus stop. Plenty of hawker stall choices. Some halal and some unhalal.
4
A bit overpriced in my opinion. Good selection of local food and if you can eat the chicken wings with a can of beer. Heavenly. Not the cheapest beer in the world though.
4
We were very hungry and wanted to have local/hawker food at 10.30pm, and so we drove to Newton Food Centre. Even though we were clad in T-shirts and shorts, we were withering in the heat. It was our first time since the completion of the renovation. I must say I was actually expecting more exciting design features from the renovation, but at least the place looked clean and had a host of food stalls. And hey, it's the food that's more important, right? I had checked the internet and was assured to my delight that the place would be open from 12pm/noon till 2am every day! Perfect!We ordered fried oyster omelette, fried Hokkien mee, sticks of pork and chicken satay accompanied with the gorgeous peanut sauce, a grilled giant prawn, rojak, sugarcane and coconut drinks, etc, and we were very, very happy. Everything was very yummy and fattening. It was fantastic especially for those who have been away from home for a while! The stall holders were all very nice and friendly too - not a single grumpy uncle or aunty. One uncle even stopped to ask us if we were happy. Wow! We left slightly past midnight and the place was still buzzing with lots of people eating and many stalls still open for business
4
Our first meal in Singapore! We were staying in the neighborhood and found this place to be a great introduction to local food. There are lots of food stalls to choose from. Just go for it! If you stand around long enough someone will likely approach you with a menu, and offer you a seat at their place, as one vendor did with us. The food is hot, good and cheap. My son maintains that this was the best fried rice he's ever had in his life
3
Newton Food Center is one of the most famous Hawker Center food markets in Singapore. Big place, lots of open seating, lots of places with Asian food joints.You can select from any of these, but the food vendors are quite pushy and aggressive in selling their joints' food so will constantly hound you to come their way.Veggie tip: There are many joints that have veggie options for Asian meals due to the large number of Indian visitors there
4
Newton Food Centre, local food, teaming with choice...and people. We strolled into the Newton Circle Food centre to look for the local Chilli Crab, we found it. Or to be more precise we found about 20 offerings of Chilli Crab, from various vendors. Here you order your food from one (or more) places and your drinks from the dedicated drink vendors.We chose ChiliCrab and Jumbo prawns, around SG$ 80 worth of local delicacies. The Chilli Crab comes almost whole, complete with shell, and you pick the meat out and enjoy this mixed with the hot and sweet chilli sauce. Although hot the taste of Chilli crab is also quite sweet, highly enjoyable and worth the effort.The jumbo prawns were 'plain' that is cooked in garlic and butter, quite tasty and, unfortunately, slightly overcooked for our palate. Never mind the experience of eating here was worth it, as was the vast selection of dishes available from the multiplicity of vendors, operating out of kitchens that are small and cramped.Quick advisory is to watch the pricing and make sure you only pay for what you buy - our crab and prawns are charged at SG$ 5.50 per 100 gms - make the vendor weight the food in front of you. Apart from that, sit back, enjoy the experience and walk away with a full tummy and plenty of memorable sights
4
Was advised to visit here by the taxi driver, we found it to be a bit overwhelming on arrival, as it is very busy, with lots of stall holders trying to get you to eat at their stall, plus everyone seems to be selling similar food.We made our selection and sat down. The food was fantastic, not greasy and full of MSG like back home. An Asian family sat next to us and they ordered food from another stall, but asked who we had ordered from, as ours looked much nicer than theirs, so I would advise you to check what people are eating before selecting were to order. I would not say it is a very cheap place to eat, but the quality of our food was great and the cost was much cheaper than the restaurants on Orchard Rd

When I first visited Singapore back in 1976 the place was -cheap plentiful and good- food, nowadays only "and" remainswent there again and tried my luck withseating, that place is maybe one of 5 Hawker centres for food left in Singapore, Singaporeasn love to go to eat there at night, the place is CROWDED, rations of food small, not too expensive if you don't mind to fork out 7 singa dollars for a king prawn your style but you need at least 5 of them to have a meal for 2 than get some of the hokkienfried noodles with porkn and sone fried mixed vegetables and tried the fresh fruit all in all average food average prices what you exept from a fast food place, still a lot of the raunchy Aussies about ( no pun intendet) or maybe the group was British or German they were sitting 5 tables away from mine, Overall anice place to go out for dinner a lot of food to choose from some food simply did not exist anymore there to eat, maybe the clientele changed over the years, I am German and worked for many years out of Singapore in the oilpatch, Then my firnds and co-worker on shore- leave after ahitch on an oil drilling rig had many Pig-Outs there late in the night and then we went for fun to the Bugis street night scene and there all hell baked loose but fun is fun for some depends what you expect the Aussie flight squadron or sailors from the Aussie or Kiwi navy had shore leave OMG stories abound, but that was the old good Singapore and We were young then, ahuge plate of fried rice with shrimp was just enough for 6 of us and priced at 8 Singi Dollars, a big plate with grilled shrimp was 12 dollars a big bottle of a local brand ( should not write about that!!) was 6 $, somebody still hungry had maybe a Chinese omelette YUM YUM, go there , have fun and if its anovelty for you eating in a hawker centre THAT"S i
4
Hawking is rife while is annoying but they can just be ignored.Indian Palace is an excellent stall and has the best garlic butter naan bread I've ever had. On Tap stall is great for homebrew beer, something different, rather than the normal bottles of Tiger.Worth a visit, recently been re-done, much nicer WC
5
after a late night and you are hungry this is the place to visit, a wide variety of choice, to choose from, Malay, Indian, Chinese, and the food is served hot and quick, the parathas out here are great, the Beer is chilled loved it
4
Good variety of food,open till late. Will suggest those who wants to grab a solid bite for supper. Better to drive/own transport, I leave my car at the hotel and took a taxi here,but waited quite a bit for a cab ride back.
5
We visited on a Friday night with some friends. Food was great especially satay chicken and beef. Indian food stalls also good although quite spicy. It wasn't cheap but reasonable given the food and atmosphere. We had a great time!
5
Many good Singapore food, satay, fried noodle, spicy seafood and specially really cold tigar beer. Good place with friend.
5
Seafood, seafood, seafood!
My personal favourite in the 'Sambal Singray', but honestly everything is just that good. A must visit place for foodies! Oh! And it's affordable too and oh! Did I forget it's fresh!?
Enjoy!

Newton Food Centre is one of the tourist trap food/hawker centres in Singapore but there are some stalls that keep the local crowd coming back. It has been revamped and reopened after a whole cleaning-down. There's a whole range of seafood eats, and that's highly recommended in the tourist guide book. However, give some local eats a try. I recommend two or three stalls:- Kwang Huat Prawn Noodles: This stall is located on the right side of the food court, if you are entering via the car park. You don't have to walk in deep, just turn right when you see the first few stores. The stall is run by a really old man, his wife and a middle-aged lady, and my father and I return more than we should for their Hokkien Mee. It's a stretch to say that I dreamt of these noodles during my time away from Singapore but it's the truth. Be ready to taste the wok the noodles were cooked in, along with noodles drenched in prawn gravy. It's very savory with prawn and squid inside the dish. Serving sizes are small, medium and large with prices of $4/5/6 (last I checked).- Heng Carrot Cake: It's by the right side of the food court. Be prepared to wait at least half an hour during peak hours. It's really affordable as well ($4/5-ish) and you can specify black or white carrot cake. This is really chopped up cubes of radish-paste (it's not icky, think of it as another alternative to rice noodles or rice cakes), egg, sauces and spring onion. The white variation has prawns inside it so watch out for the allergies. I love both renditions.My best advice for Newton Food Circus: Get here late. Think between 8pm to 11pm. The food centre gets most of its business in the night and hence many stores will not be open during the day
4
I like the Newton (Circus) food centre because of the wide variety of local delights that can be found here. The food here is delicious, but rather pricey for local food. However I think it is a good place for a gathering of friends, dinner, and supper. There was an "aunty" from one of the drinks stalls who was really funny and friendly, and was chatting happily with one of my friends. It was an enjoyable time
4
Much better quality food than some other centres. I had BBQ Stingray and fried rice which cost S$18 but the fish was freshly cooked and delicious so well worth the cost. The centre has recently reopened (May 2016) after refurbishment and was very busy but I was still able to find a seat.There was a wide selection of food to choose from the various local and regional cuisines
4
Newton Food Centre is located just 5 minutes drive away from Orchard Road and is a stone's throw away from Sheraton Towers Singapore Hotel. There is a wide variety of food especially the local cuisines like Fried Hokkien Mee, Char Kway Teow, Oyster Omelette and more. There are also a huge spread of Seafood but Prices depend on what you order
4
The reno is over and Newton is back in action. It's been given a 3-month long spruce but don't expect anything fancy-pancy as its really just good ol' street food in the same ubiquitous outdoor alfresco location off Scotts/ Orchard Roads. Personal faves include 'satay' (barbecued pork on skewers), grilled 'sambal' (chili paste) stingray, chicken wings washed down with a long cool glass of sugar cane. Overall a great one-stop for tourists and locals alike on balmy evenings
4
Just 5 mins walk from newton mrt station. The seafood we ordered from one of the stall there was good, we like the chili crab very much..must try, if you come to Singapore.
2
Food is good and service fast. Always crowdy specially in the evening. Some food too pricey. Have to work on cleanliness of common areas.
3
Walked past the other evening and noticed it was closed. Checked the National Environment Agency (government) website which advised of the renovation dates.
4
Seafood is a speciality here but also sell indian, malay and chinese dishes. reasonably priced although not the cheapest hawker centre.
1
The market closed on 1 Feb and won reopen for 3 months. Being rehabbed. Great shame. It would have been our first visit for 40 years...wait til next year, like a good Cubs fan!
5
It is just a great place to eat Asian food, all varieties. Satay galore, seafood, noodles, Tom Yum soups.Every thing for you to enjoy a great priced meal. Don't except any thing fancy, just go in your shorts and thongs and enjoy the array of great food and drinks.

If you're looking for something simple, and you don't want to wait too long for your different varieties of dishes, try out this place. Prices are reasonable, and the quality of the food is worth a try, that's if you don't compare with a fine gourmet restaurant on Orchard Rd. Majority of the guests is local, which is not a bad sign. In Singapore you will find several of these food centres. They are all clean despite the fact that you actually have a direct view into the kitchens, if you know what I mean!Ordering is very simple, go to one of the many booths, and choose any free table. Drinks are ordered seperately, suggest a good tiger beer. You'll notice how full it can get, so don't go too late to lunch or dinner. Enjoy the atmosphere

lots of varieties of SEA cuisine available at this food center, you may ignore those "aggressive" sales who sell the menu of their hawkers to you. Actually you are feel free to order the food and drinks from any of the shop within food center.Tips on the seating, recommend to sit outdoor without shelter where the air circulation is much better than inside area

The Newton Food Centre is a large open air quadrangle of small Chinese food outlets, specialising in seafood. Outlets all seem to serve similar dishes. Portions we had were good and reasonably priced. Nice, colourful area to eat at night with plenty of local atmosphere - no air con - unless the wind blows! Apparently, it is to undergo a major makeover and facelift and is due to reopen in April 2016. Worth a visit if your hotel is in the Newton Road vicinity, and you want to take a bite, where the locals eat

Frankly I didn't like anything I had here. This is a hawker market, I viewed it more as a tourist attraction rather than as a place for good food. Some of the vendors can be quite aggressive. It was hot, it wasn't clean enough for my taste and the food wasn't great. I think many people think they will come here and get something authentic ~ I don't think so
5
Good place to come have Singapore Chili crab the authentic way as well all other sorts of seafood. We chowed down on BBQ and giant prawns!
5
Newton has great eats, especially in the middle of the night ! Past 12 midnight there are much less, but still some pretty good prawn noodles, and sting ray dishes, plus others like Spicy Fried Rice !
5
Food was good as well. But the prices were relatively above average I would think - compared to other hawker centers. Many people !
4
After being assured that everywhere you eat in Singapore its clean we decided to go to Newton Circus. You get hungry just walking around to all the food shops. Very cheap compared to Sydney prices and very fresh. Chilli crab, massive prawn, fried rice vegetables and stingray, yes stingray. Everything was great.
4
Me and my husband ordered grilled tiger prawn (3 for $36) and gong gong ($12) from stall #70. We loved their grilled prawn! Must try!For the beverages, we ordered sugar can juice ($2), and it's very fresh.I read the other review about tourist trap in newton. Luckily we're not have that kind of experience. The guy from stall #70 was so honest and clearly explained their products and the prices.
3
It's one of those food centre where you can find all the good food at reasonable price. I was warned about not succumbing to the touting stall owners. Verdict: not all food are tasty. Most food are reasonably priced for the type you are eating. Not all stall have the freshest ingredients which they claimed to have. Search wisely

The Newton Food Centre is a kaleidoscope of people and food - oh the smells! My wife and I went there for dinner one evening shortly after our arrival in Singapore!.We found that Newton Food Centre was really clean, spacious but busy - full of foreigners and locals alike - all enjoying the wonderful selection of food! The variety of food is amazing - take the time to walk around and see what each food stall has to offer - there are some real hidden gems! If there is a lineup of customers outside of a food stall, it is usually a good indication that it is amazing food! I had some delicious Indian Tikka Masala with Onion Pakora and fresh baked Naan with cilantro and onion- yum!! My wife Pat had a wonderful meal of Chili Crab!! The food was delivered to our table, piping hot with mouth watering smells - oh the flavors! I cannot remember when I had a beer that frosty! We thought the price was more than reasonable given the normal high cost of eating in Singapore! We highly recommend this Singapore eating experience
3
This place is very overwhelming, with sprukers coming at you from all angles! Shop owners will encourage you to sit in front of their shop, more for the fact that they can push you to buy their food. You can find a table and order from any stall and they will bring you your food. Make sure you check prices before you order anything. We ordered chilli crab and he advised us of the weight and price before ordering. You are paying around $8-$10 SGD for a plate of food and around $5 SGD per 100g for crab. Once you have ordered your food the chaos settles down
5
Cheap eats that are tasty! It is recommended to go in the evening, but it is open during the day. There are a;; types of authentic food from Singapore and more. They can even accommodate Halal diets. I would recommend the chili crab it is a Singapore delicacy.
4
Our taxi driver recommended that we visit Newton Food Centre for excellent and "cheap"" food. Well, the food was less expensive than the restaurants in the centres on Orchard Road, but don't for one minute think that it is a bargain. There is a lovely vibe as you enter, but you are approached by so many of the vendors offering you the same fare and this can be quite off-putting. It is very tourist orientated. Each stall has pictures of the menu, and almost all are identical, so you tend to order food from the one nearest to where you can find a table.Also, what you see on the menu price wise, is not necessarily what you pay. We opted for the Crab Curry which was excellent and that was okay.But we also ordered the garlic king-size prawns and when it came to paying the price was much higher. The lady who waited on us failed to mention that the price on the board was for 4 prawns and she brought us 6! So that was a disappointment as we had found Singapore to be the most honest, and safe city that we have ever visited.It is a fun place to visit and the food is good
3
Great open air market so check the weather. A great range of affordable seafood dishes and street food including chicken wings and satay sticks. These markets are enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. Try the chilli crab!
5
We didn't have much time in Singapore but wanted to try something authentic. There is great variety and we ended up having Chinese food.

Newton food centre (popular hawker centre serving local food) has been refurbished to look more polished, so thumbs up for cleanliness. However, perhaps due to its relative popularity and convenience, the place is completely overrun by tourists or locals bringing their tourist friends. Somehow, becoming a tourist destination always affects either the food standards or the prices, and often, both. Tip: avoid the ones who send really aggressive people out to hawk with menus. The most disappointing dish had to be the oyster omelette from one of the hawkers that did not specialise in the dish. The result of my laziness (to walk to a different stall) was a perfectly round, pale and bland omelette, with a few oysters that smell and tasted foul. The dish wasn't even served with the quintessential chilli paste/sauce. A true let down. If I were to return, I would order the dish from a stall that only serves oyster omelette, I hope that would restore my faith in the food centre
3
Newton Circus is easy to reach from the MRT, and presents a great range of choice - Indian curries, Malayan dishes as well as Chinese, sushi and seafood. Be wary of being grabbed by the first vendor when you walk in, don't feel pressured to order straight away. The seafood is fine, but establish the size and therefore, PRICE, of any critter (tiger prawns are much larger than you'd think) before you order to prevent bill shock.You will have hawkers press you if you're a Western tourist, which can take away from the meal, so have a family plan in place. Word will spread if you say yes to one!Still a great place to eat, but a little caution should be exercised
4
Newton Food Centre was just a short walk from the hotel we were staying at, and we could grab some food before journeying further down to Orchard Road or jumping on the metro to travel elsewhere in Singapore. There is a wide variety of food which means most people have something they can find to eat. It is worthwhile, not necessarily for the great food (although I enjoyed everything I had on the multiple visits I made there) but for the experience, particularly if you are dining with a group who do not mind relaxed eating
5
Love nothing better than sitting outside a humid night with an endless variety of hawkers' food and an ice cold Tiger beer.Can't go past the satays, seafood, roti and murtabak (stuffed roti pancake). Love the mini octopus and crab. All delicious and relatively cheap - by Singapore standard anyway.We had originally planned in rating at Clarke Quay - but couldn't get out of there fast enough. Nice location but expensive, touristy style restaurants. Newtons is close to Orchard Rd and easy to get to my the MRT.
3
I have been eating here for 20 years. I am good friends with a number of stallholders. Try hengs carrot cake.A few rules1. Ignore touts.. no matter what rubbish rhey talk.2. Dont order anything without firm price and portion size...famous tourist trap.3. No seafood ... period... 4. Police number is 999. If you feel threatened simply call. Usually they back off. 5. Dont turn up at 1am drunk and mouthey. People have been killed over the years, especially arrogant yoing white guys. If you follow these rules, you will have fun. The touts will realise you arent a target. Dont be afraid to just ignore them - we all do! There is some excellent food there. And some great peopl

Not too far from Orchard Road, there sits the Newton Hawker Centre, a five minute walk from the MRT station. I just want a satay fix that evening but have a tough time finding a table. After walking around the centre twice, there is an empty table and I place the order for ten skewers of chicken/pork satay. Surprisingly, that store has pork satay while most in Lau Po Sat do not carry them because of religious reason.A moment later, I am asked by a waiter to move to another table because the one I am sitting is reserved for a group of friends. How ironic!As for the satay, they are all chicken satay. I don't bother complaining since they may ask me to move again to a far far away table. The satay themselves are great and taste even better with the peanut sauce.On my way out, a group of Korean tourists hold up two live Sri Lankan crabs and take photos with the arthropods because they are willing to shell out $100 to eat them with chilli sauce and black pepper. I am not into spicy food and don't want to spend that much to suck on shells. For that amount of money, I would rather have a bone-in rib eye with a nice glass of wine.Be prepare to spend in Newton. Otherwise, the service is terrible and it is reserved for tourists and friends

This is one place you want to at least visit and have a meal at while in Singapore. You will find an assortment of food selection at the Newton Food Centre. It is hard to find bad food in Singapore, at worst case, you'll have a mediocre food. If you want to be on the safe side, look at the stall grading, they are graded in A, B, C. Look for the hawser stalls that display the A grading and you won't have a problem. The food is relatively priced with average meal between $5-$8. One thing to keep in mind thou, always bring your own serviettes or napkins when visiting/having a meal in any food centre in Singapore or anywhere in Asia. In Asia, they don't supply any serviettes or napkins. Sometimes, you might find someone selling tissues for $1-$1.50, at that price, you could buy a whole box from the shop
4
We came here for late dinner, the char koew teow is nice,which is different taste from Kuala lumpur, kl style is more dry. and the clam is fresh and clean. there's variety choose there. The price is slightly higher then others food center. But here is nice for supper.
4
Great experience to go eating out with some locals, showing me the best stalls to buy delicious dishes. Different standards than in Europe; spit your bones which come with the chicken on the table!
4
A hawker food centre near the center of Singapore serving a variety of Asian food. We are craving of seafood and went home satisfied.
4
Fantastic place to eat especially fish and shellfish. So much to choose from. Hawker stalls are brilliant, staff are friendly and efficent. My only problem was it was very over priced, especially for the shellfish, but it was truly special. Worth a visit even just for a cold beer
4
Newton Food Centre is bang opposite Newton MRT station. You can just walk across the road or take the over bridge after exiting the station through Exit B. We happened to be there a tad late on a rainy afternoon and hence only less than half of the hawker stalls were open. This denied us a full impression of the variety on offer at NFC. However, whatever we ordered was sumptuous and delicious. The chicken satays & Ketupat (steamed rice cake) with peanut sauce were yummy. The Mee Goreng from the Indian stall was disappointing. The Mee Hoon was however better. I'm not a big fan of Sting Ray and thus didn't dig into the dish much. We washed the food down with Tiger & Erdinger beer. There weren't many dessert options at the place by the time we finished as it was late in the evening
4
A good food court in open Air with small corners who provide traditional Malaysian Dishes. You can share your plates in family or with friends. A local friend bring me there. And we spent a good time. The food was good. The Big tiger Prawns was a bit tasteless but ok.. A good spot to discover the local food
4
We caught a taxi from our hotel in Bugis to Newtons Circus at a cost of about $4We also caught a taxi for the return journey but had the driver take us up Orchard Rd to see the magnificent Christmas decorations at night.At Newtons we had the seafood particularly the mud crab The stall we chose [one of many] was only a few feet from where we were sitting so we could almost watch the seafood being cookedThe seafood was excellent and very reasonable in cost Refreshing drinks are readily available and plentiful [in our case non alcoholic] Overall a very pleasant meal at a most reasonable cost Newtons is a Singapore institution and should be tried by all visitor
4
To explain, this is an open air food court, with many stalls arranged around a central eating area, choose what you wish , from the stall/ stalls of your choice and they individually bring it to table . Works very smoothly , lots of choice and drinks cheaper than normal Great experience, loads of locals just having dinner. Try i
3
I wenr in this location during my visit in singapore and I found it very characteristic.to Choice the food was very easy and all the plates were very good. Of course ut is not high level restaurant but everything was nice and often I like to stay in local restaurant with locsl food cooked following traditional uses. I suggest to visit and eat in this place
4
Easy to find Hawker centre right near the Newton MRT line. We had a late lunch/early dinner at about 4pm when most of the stalls were closed. Lucky we happened to come across a good stall which was open at the time, although the owner didn't understand English very well, we were lucky to have the help of a lady at a nearby stall who translated for us. Hot chicken curry which was made better buy a lovely lady telling us which sauce would compliment the dish. Overall we found no pushiness but only helpful people from opposition stalls. Would recommend
4
Simple model, about five types of food - Thai, Seafood, Indian, Singapore, BBQ, and cold drinks. Fifty different booths, and everyone has their favorite, but the menus look about all the same. So great way to try five versions of anything you want. Local cooks make it their way. So the hawkers are easy, tough just making a choice on type of food. Everyone can pick something different. Great outside venue. Find a place, order your food and find a table. They will bring it to you. There are a Singapore and Indian place in the corner by the guy who has the coolest beer in town, in the cooler in the back. Start with those three and venture out from there
4
Went to Newton for lunch. There were less places open vs. dinner but it still didn't disappoint us and for sure we ordered more than what we could eat. i think we ate more with our eyes and ordered a lot.
5
Great bustling experience with great hawker style atmosphere. Good eclectic mix of suits,couples, families and tourists make this place a great experience. The food is first rate - tasty, hot, fast and furious....take cash as I don't think many take credit cards. Enjoy!
4
Great frish coocked food! We had all kind of sea food: pepper crab, prawns, skids... all dishes were very tasty.
We were at number 27 twice! I recommend it!!
4
A large hawker Food Centre that offers a number of different Asian cuisines. The NFC is close to the train and bus transport. A must to try the local dishes including satay, barbecue tiger prawn and chili crab.
3
The setting was nice, with both outdoor and covered seating, but as caucasian tourists, almost every hawker stall we walked past had someone who would accost us and try to pull us in to eating at their stall. They would show us the menu and talk us to distraction while we tried to look at their offerings and prices. If it wasn't repeating what I was already reading on their menu, then it was showing us some obscure newspaper articles about their stall and how some little-known chef or celebrity had endorsed their stall. How annoying! The hawkers at the Old Airport Road Food Centre don't do this and prices there are a little bit cheaper.There was a definite focus on seafood at Newton, and prices seemed a little steep. There were few dessert options, but you still had a mix of Singaporean, Malay and Indian cuisines.I ended up having fish porridge at one of the stalls for $5, which indeed was tasty, fresh and healthy owing to its simplicity. I tend to prefer a slightly more "gluggy" congee, but this was still tasty. If you're in the area and need a hawker centre, then why not drop by! I wouldn't make a special trip though because of the "tourist trap" feeling I got from the pushy hawkers, and warning signs telling people to be sure of the price of their food before ordering
5
Food courts or hawker center are quite integral to Singapore daily life & heritage. Newton FC is one of the many well managed food courts in Singapore CBD and quite famous with tourists/residents alike. Have been there couple of times in last 1 year. It's well managed and offers interesting cuisine mix from almost all of Asian countries .Quite crowded in the evenings/weekends. The place is clean and has decent setting ,more open not crampy and in a peaceful & green neighbourhood. Most shops are managed by seniors and kudos to them for quick and efficient service .Would love visit soon again for trying more dishes
4
This place is basically a giant food truck with all the options you can imagine; Indian, Thai, Malay, Chinese, Italian, German (beer), Vietnamese and everything in between. I had the Indian and got my incredibly cold cold super cold beer from Thong Lai Cold Drinks and Beer. Ask for the super cold and not from the coolers in the front. He has the really cold stuff in the back. And that cold will be needed because this place is outside and even at night with fans its still in the 90's. The better to sweat out the been and chili chicken, fire noodles and grilled sting ray. Its a little touristy but worth it for the food
4
Never had sting ray before, but it was delicious! Even my picky 11 year old ate very well. We also had a nice mix of Satay with spicy peanut sauce. There are many offers for the famous chili crab, but we did not feel that adventurous that evening. Not far from Orchard, if you happen to travel on the red line anyways.
4
Its a food court with around 50 odd food stalls and a must eat place at Singapore for street food. There are amazing varieties of food and mostly Asian seafood dishes, however they do make chicken and you can request a choice of meat.Once you enter this place you will be hogged by many hawkers putting pressure on you to order food from their stall. They will find a place for you to sit and you can accept the seating and politely decline their menu. You can say you want to explore all stalls and decide. As a tourist, its best you research on what you would like to eat so that the ordering becomes easy. Most menu are with pictures. Though there are more than 50 stalls, the food are mainly few categories.. so once you take a look at all stalls.. you can just decide one section. You will find all types of food around few stalls.If you don't see a dish you like to try, you can ask the hawkers to make them for you... and most will oblige. Its a great place to hang out and have food and beer together.The MRT is close by and goes by the same name NEWTON
5
Great atmosphere and even better food - our family ate hear 4 out of 6 nights we were in Singapore. Amazing variety of vendors - brilliant food at very reasonable prices. Cheapest beer in town! Go and see the ladies at "Goodmans" I think it was stall 61. Their food was brilliant but they were also happy to have a chat and let us experience more of the real Singapore. Only 200metres from Newton MRT station so easy access for anyone
5
Walk around first before grabbing the first table. Go with the steward's suggestions. They generally know best unless you have a particular choice or aversion. The stingray is particularly good.
5
Excellent! We had a great time and excellent food! I have been here a couple times....every time I have visited Singapore. Relaxing and where the locals go.
4
So this place is crazy! I'm so glad I was with my husband and he used to live in Singapore so he knew how to handle this place. Beware! Order directly from the food service place you want to order. If your a tourist and you sit at a table and they serve you there they will rip you off. Ask to see the prices first, then order, then sit. Be prepared to have people yelling at you constantly when your walking around trying to decide on a meal. It's crazy but the food is good and fair priced. It's worth a visit!!!!! Try the stingray and the chilli crab!
4
I went to this food spot for early supper and found out this was a favorite spot for food lovers. There were plenty of stalls serving a wide variety of mouth-watering dishes including seafood. The atmosphere was similar to those found in Malaysia. Alcoholic beverages were also available here. Generally the service was good and friendly. Good can be ordered from any stall although I always prefer to be closer to the stall from which I order my main dishes. It is an ideal spot to enjoy meals with friends and family.
4
We were taken to this place by our cab driver . We tried out few items ,as per his suggestions like chilly crab , satay , oyster omelette , Singapore chicken rice , Tom yum soup , Sting ray fry ...There is Malay , Thai , Indian food ... Fresh fruits and juices too . Hundreds of small shops - with more or less same kind of food ... And service is quick .. Clean atmosphere 
5
We were enroute from Vietnam and had a few hour transit in Singapore. Unlike most others my husband and I stepped out to go eat some good seafood and Newton was our first choice!Oh wow what a meal! I hardly could breath after our meal as it was just amazing. The Chicken wings, Satays, String Ray, prawns with sambal, singapore chilie crabs with soft buns were to die for. And highly recommend anyone to visit.
4
A nice semi outdoor place to enjoy singapore's authentic food. One of the stalls sell duck rice, the best duck rice I have tasted so far no fishy smell and the gravy is so fantastic. Another must try is the fried hokkian mee, fried carrot cake, popiah, and of course the fried oyster omellette. All you can get in one area.This hawker center is also clean and comfortable. Must visit place if you are in singapor
5
To get a really good experience of a Singapore food court, visit the Newton Hawker centre. I have been there a couple of times now and the food is good. I particularly like Mrs Tan at no.70, especially if you like seafood. The beers & drinks are supplied from next door. Word of warning...you will get inundated by people trying to sell you there food....don't accept the first person, take a good look.
2
the food was good. you can find many kind of food here. there are many "agent" which will offer you seat and menu. they are very aggresive to ask you to sit or order from menu.tips : if you don't like the food from menu, don't order. you don't have to order from them. the seat is not theirs. it's ok to look arround and order from other restaurant
3
I took a few Australians to sample hawker fareThe sea food ( which I did not try ) apparently was said to be good as well as the roast duck.However the rojak, thai style Hokkien noodles and fried carrot cake were well short of expectations. Later the taxi driver who sent me back said that it was a poor choice to come here to sample hawker fare
5
The best seafood stall among the 25 seafood stalls. Not pushy, excellent food with great service and reasonably priced. Will definitely return.
5
Multi-culti Food court with Food from all Asian cultures you find in Singapore.
The latest arrival is BEER CRAFT with beer from Singapore!
4
love to eat here. so many stalls any food to choose from. and delicious also. you can reach here by MRT
4
One of the best meals I've ever had was a plate Malaysian noodles made with Indian spices and served on a Styrofoam plate. Fantastic. Now if the touts were just a little less pushy ...
5
Very good seafood. Yes it has large dose of tourist seafood is generally fresh
The Satay's stalls all source from same factory and not homemade so taste similar.
But had a good time and food
5
You can get a wide range of food for a cheap price! I had so much on my own and definitely did not regret it. Not bad for my wallet either.
3
if you want to have a good seafood in singapore without spend a lot of money, then newton food centre offer you a lot of sea food stall. this place was well known for tourist. you have to know what you ordered, if not, be prepared to pay more than seafood restaurant at the mal
3
very pushy vendors - to the verge of dogging you until you sit down. ( doesnt matter if you are local or not ) truthfully I miss the gold old Newton but I only return there for my all time favourite Prawn Noodle Soup which I had been patronising since I was a teen
5
My cousin took me here for early dinner, glad we arrived early and so there were tons of seats. People mostly arrived around 7pm and so it would get crowded and seats filled up fast. There were tons of foods to choose from, we opted for some Sting Ray, Satay and Chicken Wings paired with some Carlsberg...food was delicious!! affordable prices and great friendly people who worked there
5
We often go there to have a local, casual experience. Only negative thing is that the waiters can be quite aggressive proposing the menu from exactly their stall - irritating... Particularly like the food from the Indian place. Their chicken dishes and garlic bread are highly recommended..
3
I don't really like food centres and this one, despite well-know, has nothing better than the others ! The food is exactly the same as any of the other hawker centre in Singapore. No really, I don;t understand why it is so "famous"!
3
Caught the local bus $1.40 from hotel, long walk and overpass to Newton. We sat and had brunch with was supposed not to be hot. However it was finally got more noodles to cool us down. Caught the train onto Haw Paw Village
5
Nothing quite beats a cheap beer and excellent food with your lunch! Great variety of culinary variety and very cheap generally $4-6 lunch and 8-12 dinner with beers around $8 for 500 ml. All stalls are impeccable clean and well worth a visit
4
Newton food center is always on my top list whenever i have a chance to visit Singapore. Last month i went with my man. as this is his 1st time to visit this place, he's literally going crazy, ordering almost every food in all the food stall lol. My all time favorite is the carrot cake, oyster omelet, and spicy sting ray. I know, i know.. i supposed not to eat sting ray, but i just couldn't help it.. its sooo good :(About the price, you cant say that this place offering cheap food.. as most of their food start at 5$ Sg, but its a touristic place after all and one of the biggest
4
Delicious seafood (bbq sting ray, garlic prawns), good roti & curry sauce, fresh coconut juice was yummy but Hainan chicken rice was just OK.Do be careful about the seafood market prices and make sure you know what you're expecting to pay for your dishes. Make sure the stall attendant tells you what you can expect to pay (don't assume even though you may be able to calculate it yourself).At this hawker market and for first time visitors (like ourselves) best to find a table, know your table number, make sure someone stays behind to keep the table then go to any of the stalls and get your food.
1
Terrible food court, repetitive food stall, the whole food court served the food in styrofoam containers for hot food and soups and plastic fork and spoon. Not eco-friendly at all and it is bad for health for using such containers. This is the food court that ripped off tourist, it is overrated and 100% not local foodcourts. Avoid a stall called "happy bak kut teh" （快乐肉骨茶）they served all bones instead of meat? I requested the uncle to cut the meat for me because it's very hard to eat with plastic spoon and the meat is too hard to chew. The uncle was very pissed off and said "It's all bones. How do you expect me to cut for you?" Uncle, I'm not the first time eating bak kut teh, don't expect your bak kut teh only have "kut" （骨）but don't have the "bak" （肉） right? There is another stall selling BBQ chicken wings, the lady boss has a very bad attitude and shout at customers. tasteless chicken served. The stall next to this BBQ chicken wings serving seafood, not too bad but the food is not very good. Petai is one of the food which hardly goes wrong, however, this food goes wrong in singapore. Well done
5
Full of locals and a few tourists, this is a must-visit. No hawkers - there are signs saying "no touting". Only the waiter comes out to your table to ask what you would like. We had BBQ stingray and chilli crab - both were fantastic. It has a great atmosphere, lots of shops to choose from. So glad we didn't miss this place
4
If you want to savor the local cuisine, this place is where you do it. The locals come here, the food range is good, there are dozens of food stalls, and the food is cheap. There is a must do food guide at the entrance near the car park. I tried the singapore chilli crab and it was fantastic. The largest crabs here are sold by the stall named Pirates seafood. If you are looking for super clean prim and proper quiet dining then this is not the place
5
So, looking for foodporn in Singapore can be full of tourist 'features' and dull. Newton food centre is where the locals eat. It's fast, fun and the food is really great. Try the sugar beat drinks, find your favourite pushy seller, they are the best, and order from many stores not just one. The black pepper crab is awesome
4
Whenever I visit Singapore I make sure I visit this place. Great place for friends gathering with lots of choices of foods. My favorite here is their famous stingray. Awesome food! You should try their baby octopus and sambal kangkong too.Recommended for Food lovers who love to explore something new
5
Enjoyed the tiger prawns , chilli crab, stingray n baby kailan. Top service n yummy food! Try the best satay n bbq chicken wings n otah at stall 50. Heard they are under same owner. Great thoughts from the owner!
5
Newtons Food Centre is a place to go if you want cheaper authentic food. See Stanley at Sin Sin BBQ Seafood. Fast, very friendly service and they make a great chilli crab. We really enjoyed our meals here.
5
The Bee Heng stall in Newton Circus Hawker Center are the best. They have been making pohpias at this location for over 40 years and are very consistent in their quality year after year...and they are good value for the money.
5
Nice place. Very good taste. Have variety and all type of food available. You must visit this place.Seafood is very nice.Very busy need to book first.
1
Since this is a favourite location for westerners in Singapore and tourists, the prices are exorbitant for a food court and the quality is mostly below average. I recommend anyone to stay away from this place and seek other, better and cheaper centers that are ample in Singapore
4
This food Center is a positive assault on the senses. A great variety of dining experiences whatever your taste. Three visits and I have tried Indian - Sinaporean sea food - Thai spicy Pork.Each occasion has been fun. The tiger beers ·are reasonably priced. Newton has become a tourist attraction - ignore the advances of the more aggressive Hawkers and take your time to select where you want to eat. This Center is like sitting in the United Nations without the politics, go indulge your senses...
2
The Hawkers here just ruined this experience for me. Way too aggressive and annoying. I want to be able to look at what ALL of the stalls have to offer and if I have a question, I am smart enough to ask. It turned me off so much, I almost left. The food that we ended up ordering was not bad but I certainly don't enjoy the hassle to get it. Enjoyed the Hawkers Centers much more in Penang. No hassle and the food was much better
2
Didn't care for the experience or the quality of the food - and since we've been hustled here once before, we were very wary the second time around. Maybe we needed locals to take us here and help with the food orders but honestly even armed with food blogger reviews of what to eat, we didn't like what we had. Have had much better food elsewhere in Singapore, minus the stress and concern on hustled

Singapore is a peninsula and therefore seafood is famous here. You can go to any seafood restaurant at Clarke Quay, China Town or Harbour front to enjoy that; or like the local people to eat at the market.Newton food centre is an excellent one for 3 reasons:1. Location2. Choices3. PricesFirst, the location of Newton market is perfect. It's on the Scott Road and Orchard Road, near the Sheraton tower, just 5 mins walk from the Newton MRT station (take exit B , turn right and cross the bridge.)Second, there're a lot of choices. Seafood is the "main course" while you can still enjoy laksa, BBQ chicken wings, 沙爹, and some local food. There are many shops there for you to choose your food. No matter it's for dinner or late supper, it can easily satisfy your needs.Thirdly, the price is value for money. No 10% additional charge as from restaurants, you can enjoy nice seafood with very reasonable price. (My husband and I ordered one black pepper crab of 1.2kg, two tiger prawn, one dish of morning glory and one deep fried chicken; all together SGD 120).Here, I have some more tips for you:1. Check the price tag for seafood clearly, make sure it's counted by weight or unit2. Go to the shop to choose the seafood or ask them to show you3. Don't choose a covered area. Enjoy your food under the sky. As the weather in Singapore is quite hot, choose the open area will be better.4. Bring wet tissue with you for cleansing after mealWish you enjoy the local Singaporean style meal

Expensive and small portions. The badger you as you walk past and when you order the food is mediocre. If you have to eat in this area go to one of the food courts around Ion Orchard, one stop away. A little cheaper and air conditioned
5
Best Location for all Asian foods in one location. Sea food was awesome, satay was nice and beer served here very chilled. Good taste must visit once your in a Singapore.
4
Food was amazing and the environment was awesome but expect to pay 20-30% more than a local would. The Chili crab and garlic prawns were amazing. The food in general was really good. The place is more for tourists.
4
We used to come to the Newton Food Centre over 30 years ago for chilli crab and satay so it was great to do so again after all these years and find that it did not disappoint. Can highly recommend this to tourists as a taste of Singapore and it is very easy to get to on the MRT by stopping at Newton

Hawker food is a specialty that one has to try when coming to Singapore. Newton Food Center is one of those places that is located near touristic areas, so it's not 100% the real deal (you get that if you have locals taking you by car to more distant food centers), but it's very close to the way it should be.I have always found the food to be great, and I do not complain about prices being a little higher than the standard Hawker food places, after all I am not a local and it's cheaper than eating in other restaurants. "Must tries" are the stingray, the sugar cane drinks, the chili crabs, but generally as you pick the food that is served to you, anything that picks your fancy is a good choice
4
Especially great for first timers to Singapore who would like experience a wide range of Singaporean foods in one convenient location. While not the best of the best, this hawker center does cover a wide variety of food selections at decent prices and quality.A must try I would recommend anyone here is the BBQ Sting ray, but ask for the chili sauce to be served on the side as for a first timer it may be a little overpowering, but you'll come to love the flavours eventually ;
4
Of all the 'hawker' style establishments in Singapore this place got our vote as the best.It has wide variety of foods at reasonable prices and a good ambience. We went as a family and our grandchildren enjoyed the experience.If this style of eating is for you well worth a visit
3
Apart from the obviously expensive items like crab dishes, the price level of the food available is pretty average. We visited at lunchtime and most of the hawkers were closed, but there were a wide enough variety for us to eat quite a substantial meal. All the basic Singaporean food items are available. The center is conveniently located across the street from the Newton (NS21) subway station.
4
This place is a fun way to end the day. If you can get past the people with menus trying to sell their Tiger Prawns, grab a table. There are so many choices of Chinese and Indian cuisine around the central eating area. Just note your table number and order what you like from the separate vendors. It's much cheaper if you go there yourself. The people who serve at the table add to the cost. The first night we paid SGD12 for a beer. Going direct, we paid SGD7.50 for a larger Tiger. The same applies with food. Try Bobby's (Denmark seafood) for Chinese
5
Stall #01-41 Newton Food Centre their selling point is super cold beer and it is almost frozen. Throughly enjoyed talking with the stall owners and they certainly have the coldest beer, buy a few bottles and ask for an ice bucket the ice will stick to the bottles
4
As a local, we know this place has attracted many tourists over the years. It sells a variety of local food, some are affordably priced and open till late at night. Having said that, many of the dishes available can also be found at typical hawker centres, sometimes at a lower price.
4
Less choices at day time and better visit there for a dinner in the evening time after. I like the plum sour juice there.
2
Aggressive restaurant workers try to get you to eat at their shop. All are rated "C" and that is not for cleanliness!
4
I think this is a great experience to be had for some raw, local food. It is fun and the food was actually really good. The prices vary quite dramatically; some dishes are really well priced and a bit of a bargain, whilst others (top end seafood, really) are quite pricey. The thing to beware of is the touting - there were COUNTLESS people coming up to us representing different stalls literally begging us to eat there. I think so long as you remember to just stick to your guns and don't give in to anyone then you will have a nice experience. Also, as far as I know this place gets better after darkâ€¦ that's when it comes to life
2
We went to the Newton food court on a Sunday, around noon. There were only around 12 stalls open, so there wasn't much choice. Maybe because of this, it didn't feel as authentic as other food courts where we've been to in Chinatown and Little India.We shared a laksa, which was good, with a fair amount of cockles, and a strong coconut flavor.The stall owners were quite pushy and we felt a bit mistreated, though we are not sure if this happened because there wasn't many people or if this behavior is rather common. Prices were also substantially higher than in other places. We do not recommend this food court
4
Visited here one evening and enjoyed all the seafood focused stalls. The sights, sounds and smells are fun and the food is great no mater where you eat. Only downside was the number of people thrusting menus in your face. Not like others hawker centers which are more civilized in this respect
5
Visited in January 2014 Amazing place, great street and unformal atmosphere, I love that you can sit anywhere and get food from the different stands, there is a great variety of typical dishes, one of my favourite being the sambal sting ray. Absolutely worth a visit if you're in Singapor
4
I have always heard about tourist being cheated for their money at the food centre but it has always been pleasant for me at least. (Might be because I'm a local). The food variety there was awesome and I usually go there for seafood.Their cockles there was really good. One of the must buy if you are there
5
All of the above! I'm not much of a connoisseur but just know what I enjoy eating and they seem to have it all at Newtons! Everything is so cheap, cheap, cheap and so yummy! Newton is just over the bridge in Scotts Road from the Newton MTR! Service is very swift but it can get a little hot if it's a hot day
4
The food is fresh and delicious. Same goes for the fruit juices. However, be careful to choose your food at the stalls and ask for prices before ordering. Whole duck will cost you 40SGD, a plate of fried rice 6SGD and a fruite juice 3SGD. Tiger prawns are 20SGD a piec
3
After living here for 6 years. I went here twice when I was super drunk and also very hungry (couldn't go home to sleep) . At 1 a.m. in the morning it wasn't much choice for food plus this place is only 1 kilometer from my home. I tried 4 stalls in total for 2 visit. The foods is eatable.
5
This is an amazing showcase of Singapore food, anything and everything you can think of. I particularly enjoyed the hand made meatball noodle place at the entrance from the car park side.
5
The whole place is filled with a spread of scrumptious food..Just name it and you'll find it.Best place for seafood!
5
Tasty hawker food well worth a visiit.
Love the chilli crab and satay sticks the most. Go in teams if possible so one of you can hold a table while the other orders.
3
This place is fairly unashamedly targeting the tourist market and is priced accordingly. Reasonable selection of all the usual local food. Tends to be cleaner than your typical neighbourhood hawker centre.
5
I recommend stall 01-10 XO Mince Meat Noodle. Order the Handmade Meatball Noodles - delicious and they can make it spicy if you want too!
3
Unfortunately our party obviously looked like tourists and were therefore subjected to every tout and their dog descending on us for business. They are doing themselves a great disservice because we not only ignored them but only bought food from places that ignored us. If everyone did this they hopefully would stop.Apart from that the food was good and inexpensiv
4
After 7 years returned back for trip in Singapore, Newton food center was still my favorite place for eat out late at night. There were many varieties of food to choose from. Chilli crab, Stringray with sambal sauce, and BBQ chicken wings were always my favorite food every time visited this food center. The food prices have increased slightly but the delicious taste of food still remain the same. Recommend to experience this place for local food with local price
1
I have to admit before bringing up the bad points that some of the dishes are delicious. BUT many of the staff is touting you to their stalls, even though there are signs NO TOUTING. It is kind of a chase for new costumes. Once you are dragged on a table another 2-3 stall servants come. Prices are way too high not only alcohol. Make sure to track down what you have and ask for a recipe. Or just stay away as Singapore has so much other more authentic Hawker Center. Tourist Trap. 
4
This is a buzzing little courtyard full of fresh local seafood. We were out to find great chilli crab and they didn't let us down. I wouldn't say it was cheap but the food was awesome. If you get 2 crabs between 2 of you don't make the mistake of ordering more seafood as that is plenty. A buzzing atmosphere and I think it was worth the experience
5
This is probably my favourite hawker centre in Singapore. Everytime I come here, I always sit in the same place. Some must try dishes are: Singapore Chilli Crab, Satay, Oyster Omelette, Grilled Chicken Wings, Sambal Stingray and Hokkien Mee.Be sure to come during dinner from around 7pm because thats when most of the stalls start opening. Most of the stalls do not open for lunch
1
If you want to be hassled, have vendors in your face, people coming at you from behind while seated. Then this is the place for you.
5
The food was great and liked the atmosphere. Very reasonably priced. Food vendors all appreciated our business and were courteous.
5
Very easy walk from the Sheraton towers or MRT station Newton Food Center has a pretty easy vibe, though not many tables are covered so would not be good to visit in the rain. Also watch out for touts as these can be quite annoying.We had fishball noodles, carrot cake(Heng’s) this was good but not spicy enough and the fierce uncle chased me away when I was trying to get some sauce ”Only for oysters!” but he relented when told it was not spicy enough and brought some over… the high point thought was stingray from stall eleven– this was fantastic with the sambal and lime deliciously complimenting the firm flesh of the fish.Might be variable due to the stalls, but we had great food and knockout value - so be careful but remember Stingray stall 11
5
This is great! It is basically tons of stands selling any type of local food. Outside they have a board to suggest some things that are local such as fried carrot cake. You ABSOLUTELY have to try it! It is so delicious and no, it doesn't have carrots and is not cake. Cheap beer, great seafood and there is really something for everyone. Look forward to going back each time we visit Singapore

It was our last night in Singapore and after the Sentosa Tour we asked the tour guide for a recommendation..where to eat. She immediately replied Newton Circle/Circus. So, we decided to try it out. We took a bus and found the famous hawker's place. Different from other hawkers place in Singapore...Newton Circus is one open rotunda/circle and on its fringes are different stalls offering various cuisines from chicken/pork curry to noodles, ice shavings of different fruits, smoothies, barbecues, oyster cakes and many other delicacies. It was a beautiful night and weather too. No rains and the moon showed itself. It was not hot nor cold and it was a nice night out in the open. The place was jampacked with diners particularly the young ones. Parties of four or six drinking beers. Students and families eating together. Within the circle, you can buy your food anywhere from the stalls and ask them to deliver to your table number. One payment can be done to the owner of the table and the system is quite simple to the guest since payment is only once. As usual, we all had different wants and everyone spread throughout the circle looking for whatever they fancy eating. After 15 minutes, we all converged in the chosen table and had a good feast....sharing unusual recipes and tasting food we haven't eaten before
4
Great place to show your tourists friends the local food, especially seafood. However, they are likely to inflate prices if you are a foreigner. Best to get an accompanying local friend along, they will know better the actual prices for the food. Great variety of foo
4
I didn't know that this place is really big tourist trap. The food vendors there are can be very pushy and try to get you to buy from them.With that being said I went there with two locals and had a fun experience. Lots of food selection and the atmosphere was nice. I am not sure I would go here if I was just by myself as I am sure the prices would have been significantly inflated. Having traveled to other places in Singapore I there are less pushy places with the same atmosphere and quality of food/service
3
I visited the food centre without knowing what to expect it was a busy hot centre with many many tourists. Be careful as the vendors want all westerns to sit with them and generally can be forceful. Do your research and have the good stall numbers written down as it can be very difficult to pick and can be hit and miss. The chilli crab we had was enjoyable but i had better food from the smaller local vendors on the streets of Singapore and in Chinatown
4
Although being a local, this is my first sharing about a food stall i recently tried with a friend visiting from China. I tried this stall (Number 43) at the famous Newton Food Centre and was served by a nice lady Gina whom i found out was formerly a Singapore Airlines stewardess no wonder the excellent service and mind you the food was not only tasty but in my opinion value for money. For 4 of us, we had one chilli crab, a plate of sambal chilli sotong (squid), charcoal grilled stingray, fried omelette and a plate of fried vegetable and guess what? All for $70
5
Our usual hangout after drinks. Grilled sambal sting ray and more beer followed by some fried rice or roti prata. Great place for locals and tourists alike. Be wary of the seafood prices though. Some people have been known to have got shocks after they saw the bills. A must try if you are anywhere on the islan
4
food food food everywhere. so many to choose from. clean, airy and plenty of space.
definitely worth a second visit...
4
I had lunch here on a weekday with friends. It was peaceful, a number of stalls were closed. However adequate choice available. No touts were encountered.
N
4
It was walking distance from our Hotel OSR, being a vegetarian I could not eat much but could taste few of the fresh juices they had. This place filled with tourists, and local alike to enjoy the fresh seafood and other food options this place has ! Must visit for all seafood lovers..
4
In the end, the test of hawker stalls is whether the food was authentic and tasted good, at a price that's worth it. Boxes ticked. I was told by someone who knew this area years ago that it is more touristy now and certainly it lacks the ramshackle local flavour of food streets in Singapore or Indonesia which I visited BUT it does have locals visiting it still, and it's an enjoyable experience. The number of stalls and range of food is overwhelming. We didn't get around to the seafood as we stuffed ourselves at first go with satay, chicken and the prawn omelette, so I'll need to go again. PS it helps to have some native advice on choices, so ask around before you visit
5
Nice place to eat seafood.I recommend the stingray and the tiger pawns with a fried rice, and some lala(clams).The sauce with the stingray is spicy, but the food is nice.It's better to go there in the evening, it's crowded but everything is open
3
I tend to avoid Newton Circus as its a tourist trap and I simply hate the touts. Most people would go for the stalls and stalls of BBQ seafood on offer but locals simply go elsewhere for better and cheaper options. One evening, I was cajoled to look past the negatives, just so we can try the fish soup. I must say this one single stall has changed my mind. I am now a fan of the fresh fish soup stall and will return just for it. My sentiments for the rest remains the same..
3
It is a fun and vibrant hawker market. I came for the stingray samba and it didn't disappoint. The carrot cake (which didn't seem to have any carrot in it) was also delicious. There was a huge array of seafood at reasonable prices and the MRT made it an easy trip. But I admit my heart is with gluttons bay for the experience with the vie
5
If you are after delicious authentic Singaporean Chill Crab (and other seafood delicacies), Newtons Food Court is a MUST VISIT. Yes I agree with other reviewers, it is overwhelming at first when you get there because there are soooooooo many shops to choose from and everybody is trying to get you to come to theirs. To be honest, the prices are very similar but if you are Muslim (like us) I'd recommend eating from a shop that actually HAS the halal certificate displayed. Go by your gut feeling, if a shop assistant is coming across very pushy - just walk past. Find one that sits well with you and go with them. Dont forget to order the fried sweet buns with your chilli crab coz that stuff is seriously the bomb diggity! I went with my husband and parents, and we had a crab each, those fried buns and some jumbo sized prawns too. What a treat! Seriously mouthwatering, finger licking good. Went down so well with Es Campur :)) yum yum! The only slightly sucky thing about Newtons Food Court, is getting a taxi BACK to your hotel was kinda hard =/ We waited at least 20mins for one to drive past. So if you have a phone, I'd recommend calling one and booking one at least 10mins before you finish your meal :)
5
A seasoned visitor to Singapore put us onto Newton for its fun atmosphere, low cost and tasty food.We went, we ate, we saw and we had a great time.It seems a little out of the way, but easy to get to by train.The vendors peddling their wares can be a little intimidating as they tended to be REALLY PUSHY ...but quite fun in its way.Plenty of dining options. Most seating is outside, so be mindful of the heat.We had fun
5
Old Singapore tastes that have not been tourist toned! You will need to take the train to this venue but really worth the trip. Only half the vendors open for lunch but if you go they have time to talk to you about their food. Night busy go in a group so you can sample lots
5
Unfortunately when I went there it was closed for two days for cleaning. It was just unlucky for me. I will visit again next time I am in Singapore.

I have been traveling to singapore 14 times now from perth WA. We have our Chinese family friends our friendship goes back 24 years now . We all have children and both families have had pleasure in seeing our children grow up together . For us singapore is very safe the people are very kind and always ready to help you we always shop and eat in many restaurants and it is always a great experience but this time we found a bad egg . We went to Newton food centre because we look like tourist everyone is trying to get your business we came across one food vendor who promised the best seafood in the place so we sat down at his table ordered his recommendation and also tiger beer we also got paper plates and plastic forks. We had lobster, prawns,rice vegetables,and a few other things when the bill came out it was $659.00 all written on a paper pad l couldn't pay by card we had to pay by cash l asked what was the wait of the seafood he couldn't tell us he had that cooked by onother vendor we have been to Newton food centre 3 times before ordered more food than this time and was able to pay by card and also had plastic plates and always have paid half the price . Not to afend our guests we paid ( Jan fa seafood be stall 46 and stall 43 his name is Bruce Lee ) He is a wander and a disgrace to the singapore peopl
4
We were taken here by a Singaporean friend and had an amazing time. There is a great atmosphere as it is outdoors. Try to get a table in the middle, away from the stalls as it can get very hot.We went back on our own the following night and were slightly harassed by a guy who was trying to force us to order from his seafood menu... Despite the fact that we didn't seafood and the prices were incredibly high. When we told him we wouldn't be ordering, he snatched the menu, said something that was probably offensive and stormed off. Don't order from people who harass you. Take your time to look around, order at the stalls and give your table number. Then pay when they bring the food over.The stingray was particularly tasty!It is more expensive than other food courts but the atmosphere makes up for it 
4
i love this place :) for me and my hubby this is the beat hawker in sg :) i soooo love the cereal prawns and baby squids ^_^ from one of the stall there .. yum! everytime i visit SG i always visit this place ..

There are lots of "food halls" in Singapore, but Newton Food Centre (sometimes just referred to as Newton Road) should be your first stop, just to experience how these places work. It was first opened in 1971 then closed in 2005 for major renovations before reopening in 2006.First, have a walk round and see what the different stalls have on offer (and which one of them has the most appetizing aroma) then decide what you want to eat. Find a table to sit at and, while one of you stays at the table, the other can go order the food from the various stalls. Your table will probably have a number, so be sure to tell the hawker where you will be sitting.Normally, you pay only after you've been served. However, in an increasing number of Hawker centres you are expected to pay as you order and carry your food to the table... you'll have to play that one by ear.Newton Food Centre is a "hawker centre" (sometimes also referred to as Food Centres). Unlike hawker centres, Food Courts are usually housed within modern shopping malls and are similar to what is known as 'Food Courts' in Europe and North America. They are generally more expensive and less authentic than Hawker Centres.At Newton Food Centre, you'll eat well and you'll eat cheap, and the atmosphere in the evenings is terrific
3
Price is crazy and thankfully I was there with a local business partner.He waved off the tourist vultures and made the right orders and decision. The 10mins he left me alone to order our dinner was insane. Had to wave off many hawkers who tried to promote their dish.Food was on an average count as I tasted better with another restaurant when I was at the Suburbs around the East
4
Loved this hawker centre for a relaxed lunch with the locals where they eat. Just walk around the entire centre and pick what you like, order and they bring it to your table, then you pay. There are soft drinks, juices and beer for sale as well. Sit under a fan, bring your own napkins and bacterial gel for the hands. You can get here on the MRT get off at Newton station and its a short walk from there. I highly recommend you eat lunch or dinner here when in Singpapore! Its good food
3
we grabbed some good food from stall 70 where they use the tacky strap line "yummie yummie food in your tummy". Simply ignore the guys trying to talk you into using their stall and absorb the atmosphere. Lively, nice bites, slightly overpriced. Great must-do evening out for the experience, not for 5* dining.
4
We eat there all the time. We've tried the Indian palace which is great (although pricier than other foods), we've tried satay sticks, chicken wings etc, and it all tastes great. I don't understand why after all these public issues of people getting ripped off after eating seafood, people still order it there. It's simple: stay way from the seafood as in Singapore they always try to rip you off, and it is always ridiculously overpriced! Also, simply ignore the guys shoving menus in your face and trying to guide you to a table. It's that easy. Besides these two things, the place is a good hawker centre
5
This is my first time eating at Newton. I went there with my family. The place is really clean and the environment was OK. There are various food in Newton Food Centre we can find anything we want from Seafood, Singapore Satay, Martabak and etc. I tried the Singapore Satay and the Cereal Prawn I enjoy eating it and LOVE BOTH OF THEM!! The price is friendly pocket and best value of money. Definitely will come here for another plate~ ;
3
Newton opened only recently after renovation, but the much hyped stalls served pretty mediocre fare. I'd avoid this in the future.
5
Delight Grilled Seafood - Stall #70. Absolutely beautiful and freshest seafood, with the friendliest ever host.
Order the Cereal Prawns, Stingray, Sambal Kang Kong, Oyster Omelette, Satay Skewers, and finish off with Ice-Cream Popiah.
Highly Recommended for cheap eats.
4
The second time to visit this place. Lively atmosphere and a variety of food choices. Tried grilled prawn, chili squid, beef and mutton satay, fried rice and fish ball noodle. The chili squid is great and my kid loves the satay!
4
We were desperate to try some Singaporean street food and to eat like the locals. Our cab driver recommended newton and said that this was the only place in the city like it and that it wasn't too much of a drive away (as were staying at the Conrad). This place has a great atmosphere, a vast selection of foods for affordable prices. Don't let the shop owners stop you from looking around. Stanley was the shop owner that won us over- good at English and very friendly. We tried chilli mud crab, chilli garlic greens and white carrot cake. Was also nice to have their fresh sugarcane juice. Overall a great experience and would return 
5
Don't miss this experience! Bag a table and visit all the food stalls - choose your meal from wherever you like and it all appears like magic at your table! Small portions are plenty and ask for small drinks too. Chilli crab is wonderful and wonderful fish too. Great for people watching and eating with the locals
5
I really enjoyed my reasonably priced Indian food, but three of my relatives got caught out with ordering the prawns.. Large print says $8 a prawn but small print actually specified $8 per 100 grams.. Their dinner turned out to be very expensive, with each prawn costing them $24 each! Carcass and eyes and she'll etc r all included so beware! Read the fine print n you will be fine
1
Beware - Pirate Seafood tactics. Stall number 56. (They may change their name regularly as I'm sure we are not he first to complain). Items are priced per 100 g but sellers don't give any indication of how many grams an item may be and they don't charge until the food is cooked, delivered and eaten. We paid almost $200 for 6 prawns. Yes, they were large but the stall owners did nothing to indicate just how much the dish would cost. The quality was definitely not up to that standard. Quite incredible tactics and not what you would expect at a hawkers market... Definitely beware - recommend Maxwell hawkers market for value and quality.
4
Bit of fun if you want to try something different and see where all the locals eat. This place is very similar to the Night Market in Bangkok in that you have all the food stalls in a circle and all the table and chairs in the centre.Try things like chilli crab, BBQ sting ray and cereal prawns. It is a lot cheaper to eat here then at places like "Jumbo" and the food is a lot better BUT make sure you always ask for a small portion and ask what the price is before you order or you'll end up with a massive bill. Same goes for drink, if you ask for a tiger beer, you'll get a 500ml bottle..
5
We were looking for some chilli crab and wandered upon Danny Tan's stall 78. We contentedly indulged in a chilli crab with some nice rolls, some enormous shrimp served with garlic and lemon, and washed it down with imported beer from a nearby stall. Wonderfully fresh food, fantastic flavours and at a fraction of the price we'd paid in a not-so-fancy restaurant a couple of nights earlier. Lovely ambience and Danny found us a nice table. It was a busy place but very pleasant and easy to hold a conversation without shouting. Will definitely return.
4
When in Singapore, one should not miss the hawker food. Though we wanted to try some other hawker centers like the Old Airport one, but staying at the Orchard Road this one was the nearest one. And it didn't disappoint. Casual ambience with no frills attached and easy on the pocket.The satay with peanut sauce as well as the chili crabs were excellent
4
Like all other Hawker stand it has been significantly cleaned and revamped in recent years but for my money it is still one of the vest, except for seafood, go to Maxwell, also overhauled.
4
Yes there are people who hassle you when you first arrive. But it is not over the top. Just ignore them and they will,go,away. That said the food is good and the beer cheap. Well worth a visit.,,
4
Great place to go for local eats. You must try the BBQ sting ray, kai lan chili crab with sugar cane juice and chicken satay!
5
Great foodcourt, plenty of cheap choices (among them being serial sellers, oysters omelette, crab, ray fish...)
Absolutely one of the key experiences to go through once in Singapore !
4
Don't miss out on the stingray. Staff very helpful. Accessible from MRT. Not any cheaper than the food courts at some shopping centres but we'll worth a visit
5
I have frequented Newton Circus for 15+ years...it has changed over the years (always improving). They have cleaned up the place (new stalls, new picnic tables, etc) and it is better than ever. This is an outdoors hawker market so one must be prepared for the "hawker" experience. But I have ALWAYS had good food, GIANT PRAWNS and Chili Crab. This ranks amongst the top 10 eateries in the world on MY list. A MUST SEE stop when visiting Singapore!
4
A touristy food centre, but with such a wide choice of stalls that you would be a fussy eater not to find something to tempt you. If you are worried about the crowds, get there early, when you will get the chance to take things at a slower pace. Definitely worth a visit
1
Really dislike this hawker center. One visit was enough for me, I won’t give it a second chance. There are so many amazingly wonderful hawker centers in Singapore, why anyone goes to Newton Circus is beyond my comprehension. You get accosted with pesky hagglers the second you arrive, the tables have warnings about not ordering from the individuals haggling you but to order directly at the stall instead. This sort of says it all. Newton Circus is a generally unpleasant place because of these people. Lau Pa Sat satay evenings has a slight bit of this same scene but they leave you alone after one attempt, and the overall vibe is enjoyable and hectic and manageable. At Newton Circus, there is nothing enjoyable at all about the persistent hecklers who are there, it feels like, to exploit the tourist element. As to the quality of the food, I can’t even comment because I couldn’t wait to leave. Thankfully I have tons of other fantastic choices for hawker food, I am not missing anything by opting out of this one

This spot is a must-go for my family whenever we visit Singapore. My father especially loves the stingray dish they serve which is absolutely delicious. We have always had a great time coming here and the food never disappoints. The seafood is some of the best you can have in Singapore.

There are many very good hawker centers all over Singapore and it's always a predictably good experience to eat there. Aside from Gluttons Bay and Lau Pa Sat Hawker Centre, Newton Food Centre is one of the best places to eat at.They have one of the most numerous choices of food stalls to order from (just don't be swayed by the 'touts' or persons trying to persuade you to order from their stalls). You can survey the offerings first and check the menu. Highly recommended here are: chili crabs, cereal prawns, grilled sting ray, lemon chicken, barbecued chicken wings, fried rice and for dessert, the chendol and ice kachang (with fruit topping).Tips: 1) The place is almost always full at dinner time so be prepared to wait for a table specially if you are with a large group. 2) When ordering crabs, remember that they sell them by weight so order what will suffice for you and your company. We ordered from the group of stalls in the area of stall #76 and they were pretty straight - they found the correct-sized crab for us.3) It's okay to eat with your hands here - in fact, I think it's better to eat with your hands here. There are plenty of wash areas around the centre so don't worry.4) Tips are not expected - some of the nice food waiters will even order for you in other stalls without extra charge.5) The place gets noisy, sometimes you'd hear loud voices or shouting from drinkers. It's no cause for alarm, the place (as in most of Singapore) is perfectly safe.6) The food here (as well as in other popular hawker centers) are priced slightly higher than the common hawker centers so add a few more dollars to your budget. It's not too much as they try to keep the prices well below the air-conditioned restaurants outside. (For example, barbecued chicken wings sell for S$1.40 to S$1.80 in restaurants, it's around S$1.30 in Newton.)If you are a tourist in Singapore, a hawker centre is almost a mandatory stop

After taking MRT to Newton station, walking through a dark path....passing through the footbridge. Finally arrive the food centre.
Great seafood food court, each booth almost selling the same seafood. So, we just choose one randomly. As there's outdoor area, it's quite hot!
5
Great place and atmosphere if you wish something different. Yes, there are all trying to get your business but what would you expect. Food is fresh and it is a change from the great selection of restaurants Singapore offers. Will visit again.

I got so fed up with the touts pushing menus in my face I left
Very noisy and average food
Try Satay by the Bay much nicer
3
There are many good foods around in the food centre. Used to patronise the place quite often, till the touting got kinda worse... Not all the stalls, just a handful of them. Beware of those seafood stalls! Check on the price before you order or you'll be barbecued!!
1
Been there for the first time in many years, seems like nothing much changed. Overpriced food, touts plunging menus at your chest at every step. A disappointing array of stalls that seem to sell only seafood. This is unlike Maxwell Hawker Centre or Smith Street. Really disturbing.
4
For an entertaining night out in Singapore, with food thrown in, you can't do better than to head for Newton Food Centre. With Indian, seafood, Chinese, barbecue, drinks and much more, cruise the stalls, put in your order and sit and admire the scene while you wait. You'll see extended families, gangs of noisy teenagers and groups of office workers dining together in happy chaos that somehow isn't chaotic. The standard of the fare is variable, but the prices are modest and a visit to Singapore is not complete without a visit to this rainbow-coloured social leveller
5
We just came back from Newton Food Centre in Singapore, thanks to a lucky tip-off by an interesting taxi driver in the morning. when we told him that we were looking for more authentic food he suggested the Newton Centre and we thought we'd give it a go. Luckily my husband had read about the sprukers and how pushy they are so we were prepared. We finally settled for a seafood place at stall number 66, won over by Stanley's (the owner) and the strong endorsement of a long-standing customer. The chilli crab was great and not too spicy, as we asked. We then got yummy satay sticks from number 72, also delicious, and a sugar cane juice with lemon which was very refreshing. We'll definitely return on our next trip. Restaurant quality, fresh food at a fraction of the price
4
Our family stayed in Singapore for 4 days during the last Easter holidays. We had food for dinner from this openair food court for 3 nights (took away to hotel one of the occasions). We had tried black pepper crab, chilly crab, grilled tiger shrimp, oatmeal shrimp, stingray, grilled chicken wing etc etc. In the past, we went to the famous seafood restaurants like Jumbo at Clarke Quay and No Sign Board at the East Coast. For sure, the seafood in this food centre have the best value for money. Fresh, food come quick and price much better eg 1 black pepper crab only charges S$38.Everytime we took taxi to be here, we were kindly repeatedly reminded by the drivers that we MUST ascertain the price before ordering any seafood as some tourists had been cheated before.Rather hot for some persons maybe as I saw my niece sweat a lot and became impatient. I am fine though.One undesirable thing about this place is that it is very difficult to get a taxi when leaving. The taxis are unwilling to drive into the queueing area I don't know why. There is a MRT station (Newton) nearby by 5 mins walk though
5
Newton Circus is an outdoor Hawker Centre which is only open at night from 6pm til late. Being outdoor they have a few foods you won't find at indoor hawkers, like satay and fresh seafood cooked over coals, as well as all of the normal hawker foods. Don't be overwhelmed by pushy hawkers. You can sit at any table you like and order from any shop you like no matter which table you sit at. Just be warned to agree on the price of seafood when ordering. By far the best food available is sambal stingray and you won't find this outside of Singapore. A large stingray is S$18-20 and small about S$12. If you like chilli then make sure you try it
4
OK, so Newton Circus has been there for donkey's years and it's a bit of a cliche but it's still worth a visit. It's a five minute cab ride from Orchard and although there are a lot of tourists there, it's also packed with local families eating good food at very reasonable prices. Everything we had was tasty and I doubt we spent US$30 between the four of us, including drinks
4
We came to this place to have dessert and we found this shaved ice place, it was really good, especially the one with mango pudding.
5
The food at Newton food centre is delicious, cheap and fresh. Beer is cheap (needed to keep the chilli heat down) Try stall 36 as they are very friendly and their food is delicious !!!
4
i visited this place very late at night. luckily, most of the stores that i want to try is open. i have went to other food places but i think this place is one of the best ! the place is clean, acceptable i would say. suggested to go empty stomach so get to try more stuff! highly recommended for the fish and satay
4
This place days back from many years. They have upgraded the Centre, but the atmosphere is still the same. Sales people are trying to sell their food from the moment you walk in. Relax and do not let them intimidate you. Take your time. Do not expect serving standards from a fine dine restaurant. But once the food is on the table you will for sure enjoy the local quesine. Don't wear a new outfit especially if you go for the chilli crab. Taxi drivers know the place and it is easy to reach from the city center.

Went here twice. Newton has gotten some bad press saying some of the hawkers were over charging. Hard to say, since you do not know how much something weighs that is charged by the gm. First time had chilli crab which had a good flavor and not over spicy if that is your thing. The sting ray was ok and many people also ordered probably because of it's uniqueness. The kang kang (morning glory) also good. 2nd time had black pepper crab which was also good. But the baby gai lan not as good as the kang kang. Also got the tiger prawn which was very expensive at 16SGD for one. Cooked in a lot of garlic which I like, but short on the butter. Several years ago, had much better and of course less costly. So, if you know what to order and where you can get a good tasty meal. We also went to a restaurant and had chilli crab, but cost a lot more, so depends where you want yo put your money, in the food or in the atmosphere. Told that Newton's was closing, but there are a lot of places in Singapore and not too expensive. Lots of restaurants on Geylang, but did not try
3
Crowded and food quality was surprisingly mediocre. Had fried prawn Mee, Or Luak, Chicken wings and Satay. None of the dishes were particularly good. Skip this and go to Maxwell Road. We even rate the food centres at Tiong Bahru Market and Redhill Market head and shoulders above Newton. We won't be back.
5
Best sea food quality, quick service, timely delivered, quality of food is fresh at all the shops. Soursa juice is the must try option. We tried ray fish when we came singapore last time in april, on my next visit i was most likely found at newton food center only. :-
2
From the moment we entered, touts tried almost took us by the arm and led us to their "favourite" stall. Even when seated we were approached by numeous people trying to sell. Really annoying. Furthermore prices are not that low and food quality average (although to be fair we only tried 2 food and 1 drinks stall). Will not go back
3
At first I was in awe of the number of food stalls available (maybe 80?), but then soon realised that probably three quarters of them were selling the same Singaporean style BBQ seafood! However funnily enough, there was only 1 stall that did laksa which is what we were craving. Because there is some much competition for the same food, you will get approached by store owners wanting to distinguish their food from others which can be a little overwhelming. We tried food from 4 different stalls, and it was all pretty good, and the prices seemed on par with what we have experienced elsewhere in Singapore. But, I personally prefer the atmosphere of Glutton's Bay for the location, atmosphere and simplicity of choice - i.e. there weren't nearly as many stalls, but they all offered different menus so it was easy to find what you want.Incidentally, we came with a baby stroller via the MRT. It's a short walk from Newton station, but the main way to get there is via an overpass with lots of stairs. You can walk around but it's a longer walk, so perhaps for the mobility challenged find another way to get there, or if you can just leave the stroller at home
4
baby squid baby squid baby squid. nomss. ok first time I tried eating here was back in August 2013, my friend's aunt live nearby so she recommended us to eat here (also known as Newton Circus) and to eat this particular menu: baby squid. It's located near MRT, maybe you only have to walk like 10 mins, across this bridge to get there. when you enter, go right and go to this chinese food stand near the drink seller and order baby squid (choose the medium or large one, costs around s$12? not sure). and you're welcome. ;
4
Food was great, seafood awesome. A little on the pricey side but no more than Australia. Must try the butter roti and fresh juice, fantastic. Across the rd from Newton MRT so very easy to get to, highly recommend visiting.
5
A1 Barbque seafood is a great place to get seafood but it is open only after 5 pm. There are places to buy roti prata and indian food as well during the day.
4
The seafood selection is really nice. But you there nothing that stands out. The squid was really good and the Satay was very dry and overcooked but the peanut sauce was amazing.
4
I love this place. Despite it being tagged as a touristy hawker centre, I still enjoyed the place more than other popular hawker centres. I think they have a combination of good food and good ambiance. It's great to be able to sit around in the open area in the middle and enjoy the company of your friends and family over good food and beer. You could see a lot of locals patronizing the stalls here late at night.Do some research, google the internet and get some wonderful information (esp in some blog entries by locals), about the best stalls to eat, and pretty much states the prices for each dish. I agree you may get cheaper and perhaps better tasting chili crabs or hainanese chicken rice elsewhere, but at the end of the day, everyone's tastes and priorities are different. This place offers a great combination, may not have "all the best" in Singapore food in one place, but nevertheless, great tasting food.Because the place is big, it's not as crowded. We wanted a table outdoor but then we were a big group, so we ended up sitting in one of the long tables under the covered area, which was ok. Upside is we were nearer to the stalls and if we wanted more food or drinks, aunty or uncle was just beside us ;-)Foreigners might be put off by the sometimes rude aunties and uncles who sell the food here or the too pushy stall owners crowding around you to encourage you to buy from their stalls. But that's just how it is. You can politely smile and just say no or we'll look around first, and just walk around and make your first scan through all the stalls. Most of the stall owners are usually loud voiced, no nonsense, no smile, no small talk type of people, that's just the culture here and don't take it personally. Order your food, tell them your table number, when the food arrives at your table, just pay for it, and focus on enjoying your food and the company of friends/family you're there with. The westernized type of customer service is not something you should expect here ;-)Some tips:- have fun, enjoy the food, don't mind the service :-)- scan through the stalls first, look through menu and prices- seafood will always be expensive anyway in the world, but because they have no fixed price (seasonal), best to ask for prices before confirming your order; if they do not give you prices, then go to another stall; tourists usually get rip off because they don't know what to expect and don't ask- like i said, do your research, there's literally a sleuth of info nowadays on the internet and a little research goes a long way in making your travel more enjoyable- look for stalls with long lines, they're usually the good ones, and thus, more sought afte

After arriving late in from Kuala Lumpur on a bus we ventured here around midnight. Great place to grab some late food. A whisk around the stands ordering food and drinks and waiting for table delivery. Good food at reasonable prices. Of course there are cheaper Hawker stands to be had if you are in the mood of being a "local", but it was also good to see plenty of "locals" eating here late at night. Please keep in mind, this review is in general about Newton, it is comprised of many different stalls, thus your experience can and will vary greatly
1
Do not be fooled by their service and their hospitality. please spend sometime to look around and compare prices. They would say every hawker stall would have a standard pricing to maintain that everywhere are the same. They would recommend chilli crab and king prawn. They wouldnt tell u how much it weight. Based on my experience, I recon there is something fishy after ordering. During our meal, The bald guy who served us kept asking how was our food later on.. they were communicating in chinese with some taxi driver who I pressume r a regular at that place having their beers telling them not to tell us how expensive it was. they assume we were foreigners who doesnt understand hokkien. And I quote, a taxi driver ask, so how much u eat the chilli crab? The bald guy say dont tell them, let them eat first! Let it be! Taxi driver say, why u dont ask them to order again? Bald guy say, I think its enough for them. Taxi driver say, nvrmind..let them order somemore, we r waiting for them to let us eat too..Geezzz! What kind of personality is that? I am very disappointed when the bill came with an outrages $240 for 2 person. Just food only. Tourist!! Pls avoid this hawker stall! I recommend u could find better food at maxwell or pasir panjang is u looking for seafood.Really terrible!Dishonest and so many hidden cost

Although a touristy place with all those stall owners inviting you to order from them, you can get a good deal at Newton if you have the patience to recon the stalls first. Most stalls serve BBQ seafood, so if you're looking for Grilled Stingray and Chili Crab, you'll have a lot of choices here.We ended up with stall 66 owned by Stanley. His non-pushy sales talk convinced us to try his grilled stingray which was really fresh and delightful. Despite being a group of 4, he didn't push us to get the biggest size since he wanted us to finish the fish rather than see it go to waste as leftovers. He also ordered oyster omelette for us from another stall with no extra charge (we paid directly to the person who delivered the dish to us). There are other recommended stalls by other travellers, blogs and guidebooks so be sure to check around and compare. Make sure the seafood is fresh, not frozen as it really affects the flavor. And always agree on the prices before ordering or eating as the signs say. It is a little more expensive than other hawker places but it is the nearest hawker place with enough seafood choices from Orchard Road (a pleasant 1.4km walk, enough to burn calories you'll be taking in after a meal there).
1
We had heard good things about Newton food centre and went there for dinner on our last night in Singapore. Whilst the service was very good and the selection of food excellent beware of the cost of seafood. We order 6 king prawns, 1 chilli crab and 2 other non seafood dishes and the total cost was $394 SING for 4 adults. Outrageous!!! We challenged the bill with the waiter, asked for a receipt itemising the pricing and after a bit of discussion we were eventually given $160 back and we are sure he still made a healthy profit. If you order seafood go to the shop front and ask how much it weighs and then the cost. We should have done that ourselves and have now learnt a valuable and costly lesson
4
There is a great selection of seafood and all other types of dishes we opted for crayfish tails and of course had to try the famous chilli crab which was very hot but also very nice and went down well with a few cold tiger beers. Some of the seafood is quite expensive like the lobster at about $8 for 100grms so about $80 for a whole lobster. Its easy to get to on the MRT and is just a short walk from the statio
4
I still maintain that Singapore is the most polite place I've ever been but having gone to the Newton Food Court on the advice of a fellow traveller I'm glad to say that it's had it's hair ruffled a little. Easy to get to on the MRT you know you're in Asia as soon as you enter with the stall holders actively (not aggressively) flouting the 'No Touting' signs and inviting you to their many and varied foodstuffs. To be honest my wife and I basically invited this behaviour by walking round the entire food court before deciding, more or less at random, who to order from. I was delighted to see that this establishment is frequented by a lot of locals from teenagers upwards. It's clearly a local favourite, we had a lovely meal in a lively environment a lot cheaper than we'd eaten up to then. I heartily recommend the Newton Food Court and I'd eat there again in a heartbeat
4
We have eaten at Newton several times, and always make it a priority when in Singapore. We always go to #74 and see Muhamad. If you want a dish thats not on his menu he's happy to source it from another stall. Bbq stingray and an ice cold tiger beer is a wonderful way to end an evevning
4
Modernised substantially since days of old but still retaining that hustle bustle atmosphere of food in a jiffy but at today's prices and in smaller quantities.Be prepared to barter as always and be selective about your choice of stalls - there is plenty of open air free seating & some covered but a myriad of owners will try to encourage you to occupy an area close by. Great food of many varying cultures is available from whomever you choose to buy from and liquid refreshments are substantially cheaper than those of local bars.Another one of those "bucket list" items ..... carry a few extra serviettes or hand wipes in your bag... you will need them!! Enjo
4
This is very much a tourist attraction, however, A LOT of locals come here. Be warned the restaurant owners will hassle you to buy from them, but its all part of the experience. We were told from a local to only go the stalls with the 'A' rating. We came here twice and both times thoroughly enjoyed the food - the beer isn't a bad price either. (PS: carrot cake does not actually have any carrot in it - its an egg omelette of some kind) :
4
This must be one of our highlights visiting Singapore, savoring local food especially the so-called hawker type cooking. Newton Food Centre was a bit more expensive comparatively but it was well worth it because it was well organized, clean and fantastic service from all stalls. It was also a place for people watching, really fascinating! We particularly enjoyed the fish balls, the tiger prawns, the see hums (blood clams), and the chicken skewers. All the seafood we had were cooked to perfection. I would certainly return to Singapore just for hawker food
4
What a place! It was a short MRT ride from Marina Square area. The experience starts with many people trying to get you to there "restaurant." Interesting since all of them, almost, serve the same food. We ordered chili crab, a good choice but very messy to eat. The stingray fish is Ok. The fried rice is good. Overall, it is a good experience to sample the "other" Singapore. Jack, our server, was really pleasant. His was Stall 31, Newton Heng Heng BBQ. Worth your try while,in Singapore
5
Lots to choose from and reasonable prices. Some may be put off by the idea of street food but in Singapore have no fear. Everything is clean and safe as they take great pride on their food and service. Sure you get asked once too many times if you want stingray fried rice, but with a simple no, a smile and a wave eventually you can find something you like. The only warning is not to order from the table. Order at the booth of your choosing and pick a table. They will bring it to your table and then pay.
1
What a place! I haven't had such an unpleasant dinner in years! The touting started once I stepped into the food centre. To find a seat, I was accosted by more than 3 different hawkers! And there was no peace even after I sat down! Seafood BBQ stalls made up at least 50% of the stalls there. To determine the pricing level, I compared the price of crabs, which is one of the pricier items on the seafood menu. I was quoted between $40-45/kg, comparable to other hawker centres. As long as you know the estimated prices of the dishes you were ordering, you would not be overcharged. Even so, I am so going back to Old Airport Road Food Centre or Pasir Panjang Food Centre for my seafood BBQ and hawker food fix
4
This visit was recommended by a cousin. It is open up until late hours, there are many options for food establishments, open air, wide tables. It can be a tad off-putting in the beginning as people walk up to you and practically force you to their stall. Just walk around and look at your options before making a decision. I'll have to say, though, that Newton was the most memorable culinary stop we made in SG. Everything we ordered was Really Good. We had a very picky eater in our group but she just wolfed down almost everything we ordered! We had Hainanese Chicken, Stingray cooked with sweet sauce, vegetables, Squid stir fry, Fried Rice and the runaway winner: Cereal Prawns. Man, I still dream of that Cereal Prawn dish... my other cousin had severe allergies but still ate the cereal prawn saying it was so good, it was worth going to the hospital over.Order drinks from the fruit shake stall near the entrance- I would recommend the watermelon shake, but the milk tea and lychee drink are also good. Total bill for a group of 6 came down to less than SD 100
4
If you are not particular about the ambiance, and would like to try street food there are many food centres. Newton happened to be near where we stayed. So we stopped by on three occasions, each time to try something different, which you are not likely to get upmarket establishments.Most sea-food places have similar menu, catch of the day and standard prices. However, you need to know what you will get before you order. S$4 / 100 gm chilli crab or S$8 / 100 gm jumbo prawn may seem reasonable, till you get the weight - smallest crab is 850 gm or more, a prawn 200 gm so you end up paying close to S$ 50 per person with a beverage and side order. But all worth a try. We wanted to try fish head curry, but that day it was not available at any of the sea food places.Evenings the Centre is much busier than day time. Quite a few stores open only for dinner
2
I come to Singapore regularly, but hadn't been to Newton's food centre for almost 30 years. Sadly it is now full of aggressive touts which were very off-putting, and the food was very expensive and not good quality. Every menu shoved at us looked exactly the same and we gave up in the end and just ordered three dishes, of which only one was of reasonable quality. The Singapore noodles we ordered were just...noodles (not properly cooked at all) with a few token pices of bean sprout and a few tiny prawns, for $15 SGD. They took half an hour to come, and arrived 20 minutes after everything else. It looked so bad I declined to eat it and we ended up sharing a nasi goreng from room service at our hotel. Very sorry I went back there. I've had fantastic food lately at other hawkers' centres and food courts in Singapore, but this was disappointing to say the least
5
There aren't too many places in Singapore to get good cheap eats and reasonably priced beer. Stop by Newton Circus for some char kway teow and an ice cold Tiger and you're out for $20!
5
I tried Kup Kee Egg omelette and BBQ chicken wing. They are very yummy. This food centre is very clean and tidy as the staff clean up tables very quick.
4
Had a couple of great meals here. The people trying to sell you sea food were annoying, but the Mee Gorang from store 65.... wow.
2
recent visit to newton FC compare to my last trip since 2 years ago1) food price - expensive - min $5 onwards compare to other area. for the non-air-con place like this, i could have find something better in shopping mall2) hygiene - bitten by mosquito and the cleanliness is not that good compare to other FC i been to3) service from the hawker - poor attitude and too commercialized. No one is smiling and zero customer interaction. cant feel the Singapore friendliness and warm welcome4) food quality - one word to describe " BAD"My family has concluded that we will not come back to this FC anymore
5
I love to eat in Food Courts in Singapore.... it's just part of the way of life here. Yes, they're noisy, bustling, sometimes hassly but full of people who just love to eat!If you want excellent seafood with charming service head to Ms Tan's at stall 70.She's a character and such a good saleswoman that she deserves your custom. The tiger prawns were great, so fresh, succulent and perfectly seasoned. For once the sales pitch was accurate. I do know that having so many people trying to persuade you to eat from their stall can be mind scrambling so why not head straight for one which comes highly recommended? Also don't hesitate to ask Mrs Tan for recommendations for other types of stalls. The cut fruit one she steered us to was also high quality.As she says, "Yummy yummy in your tummy!" For once it's really true
4
Singapore surely offers a lot of opportunities for food lovers. The Newton food center is one of the places that you should visit. It is a kind of popular food court packed with lots of small shops offering the best of the local cuisine. Just pick one of them up and you can taste satays, seafood, stingrays, cray fish etc. Always quite packed with tourists and residents is the place to go if you are looking for local good food at reasonably low prices. Worth a visit
4
Took my couple friend to the food center for a proper Singaporean hawker food. The place has become quite touristsh... Stop letting store people to push you with their selling skills. My suggestion is to go round the whole food court and view the stores individual before deciding which one to order with. Don't forget your table number too. I would also suggest to sit outside the main circle which is quieter and less hot. Overall, compare with Lau Pa Sha, the price would be slightly cheaper but still more pricy than other neighbour hawker food centers
4
We had our first dinner in Singapore at this Centre. Excellent atmosphere. Food are great and not expensive. So many stalls selling grilled seafood and a wide variety of choices are available. The grilled prawn is great, satay wonderful and fish congee tasty. The fried oyster cake and fried carrot cake in Singaporean style are also worth trying. However, the hawkers promoting their seafood are a bit annoying
4
We were returning to Newtons after many years and it was a must do for us. We were after the Chilli Crab and after a walk around decided on a vendor two crabs for $30, fried rice to accompany, no frill dining here, a tiger beer for my other half but unfortunately no wine available for me, but so cheap and delicious. We ended up returning the next night to the same vendor to have Chilli Mussels and then Black Pepper Crab, both were delicious and for us so cheap. I took my own half bottle of wine with me this time.I would go back without hesitation, food was our main interest in having a stopover in Singaporeand we were not disappointed
4
The food is generally pretty good, don't get me wrong, especially if you take note of where the locals are lining up. However, as far as hawker centers go it's quite expensive (comparatively) which is probably due to it's proximity to Orchard Rd, but that's not something that should stop you visiting because there are some great selections here and the atmosphere is pretty good. And it's open late, so close to perfect for a snack if you arrive into Singapore later in the day
5
Fresh, delicious and affordable!
I had the Chili Crab which truly lived up to my expectations!
Well worth the cab fare to get there.
Suggestion: Ask for size of crab & price before it is cooked.
4
read my other review - only thing i left out was to try the sour sap its unbelievable and located right next to my favorite seafood stand that i described where to find in my other listing
3
The owners of this food centre can charge you an arm and a leg if you are not careful. Its hot but the sting ray is just awesome. Order the Tiger to wash it down
4
What a nice vibrant place to go with your visitors. The local food is delicious and there is a huge variety. Everybody like the local atmosphere, the good food ...
1
Complete rip-off. Ridiculous prices. Poor quality. Worst hawker center of Singapore. A disgrace to Singapore.
5
Great experience - eat like the locals. Worth the cab ride from anywhere in the city. Fab seafood and great variety - exactly the same as 25 years ago my father in law told us! Watch the weight with the seafood or you could end up with a surprise on your bill! The stall holders all vie for your patronage but do not feel obligated even if they do seat you - be firm with them if you want to have a look around and check the prices on their menu before paying the bill. Four dishes for $32!
3
Worth a visit for the atmosphere but not worth for the food alone. Definitely living on its tourist appeal and past reputation. The food is fresh and good but nothing exceptional. And other than for the amazing variety of seafood on offer in one place you are essentially paying at least double the price for the same quality of food as in most regular food courts. Most of the stalls have very similar menus so again its more about variety of seafood rather than variety of cuisine or cooking style. The atmosphere is fun and lively but at times the touts can be a nuisance, especially when trying to decide on a place to eat. Ticked off the list but probably wont return
3
There are numerous stalls at this hawker market. We eventually settled on stall 31 with Mei who was a real bright spark as opposed to the hard sell of the other stall owners. BBQ'ed Stingray, Chilli Crab, and Chilli Prawns. The food was ultra fresh. you will see signs advising what standard of cleanliness each stall has been assessed at. Those not displaying this have a low level as assessed by the health department. The atmosphere was magificent with a Singapore flavour. I was told that this hawker market is not as authentic as the others as it has been taken over by new migrants. Make sure you ask what the cost will be for each dish. Our meal for 3 cost S$130 still reasonable for what it was but I think could have been cheaper

Great food but a little more expensive than the usual local food centre but it is a one stop destination to try out all the local dishes. The outdoor experience is great but avoid the area during raining season at the last quarter of the year from Aug - Dec
4
I took my foreign friends and colleagues to this food court many times before - the last time was in Feb 2013. They have a wide variety of stores and local dishes and drinks that you can choose. What my friends and I love most is Chili crab with buns, sambal stingray and satays. Highly recommend the first store on your right at the entrance leading to the overpass on the way to MRT. The lady's name was Ah Mei

This place has all your food delights for lunch and if you want something differant each day you are sure to have here. Easy to get to by cab!

It's good and varieties of Sea food available but bit expensive.. outside in other food court we can get in lower price as well, taste wise it's good but not worth .
2
i think this place have been overated by tourist and also locals. generally food is not nice and the only things worth a try might be the duck rice.

I was so looking forward to sampling the hawker centers of Singapore but this one and another we tried were so disappointing. Not cheap and not good--I guess the food was decent enough, but nothing special and it looked like most stalls served the exact same food. It reminded me of a food court (and the real food court at the Marina Bay shopping center had much better food) more than the excellent food that I've tasted at night markets all over SE Asia

The Newton Food Center is one of the most famous Hawker centers in Singapore. It is also located close to Orchard Street and attracts lots of tourists. It is quite an experience - open air eating next to stalls that cook food to your order. If you are a vegetarian, there are some limited options but you won't go hungry.1. There is a stall that sells "North Indian food" and which is similar to what you can get at any Indian restaurant around the world, only cheaper2. You can get Roti John at many stores - just tell them that you want it vegetarian and whether you want eggs. A medium Roti John costs ~ 5.00 SGD and will leave you very full. It is a long bread shaped like a baguette but with the consistency of a sandwich bun, stuffed with grilled vegetables and then cooked on a pan.3. Roti Prata (a corruption of the HIndi word Paratha). - will taste more like a Kulcha that you can get at any Indian Restaurant - a bit like a puff pastry - a multilayerd bread - served with a sauce.4. A number of local noodle dishes like Goreng can be cooked without meat - just ask the hawker. Since it is cooked right in front of you, you can see what they are doing.Tips:find a table under a fan - it gets quite hot even under the awningsignore the touts - they can aggressively try to get you to their stallcarry paper napkins, sanitizing wipe
2
There are so many places to eat in Singapore I never understood why this place is so popular. Agreed it's easy to get to but it cater for tourists, charges too much, often rips people off and you can find much better almost anywhere. Head to the east costs there is some great eating places there, but don't expect much here
5
A must to go for a taste of local dining experience. I was introduced to this stall - Lucky Newtown Seafood Stall No. 82 in year 2010. Best stall in Newton to date. Fresh seafood and very reasonably price. Check out their Sambal Lobster and BBQ stingray. Super friendly staff. Close on Monday
5
I love this place, never will disappoint, it's basic settings but excellent food. The chilli crab is always a winner, jumbo prawns and sataty washed down by crisp cold beer. Have a wander around and order different dishes from the various stalls you won't be disappointed
4
Huge place with many stall offer variety of foods. Had dinner from one seafood stall (can't recall the store no) Ordered fried baby squid, grill fish, cereal prawn and baby kailan with oyster sauce. All small and enough to feed 3 person. Total only $65. Taxi service is available at the main entrance. Need to queue for about 10mins, depending on the queue and the taxi availability
4
I was here a couple of years back for a few day and every time I remember going back with a smile and still my wallet like my tummy was heavy. The food is not cheap there but is not expensive. The sea food was amazing but all other food offered in the menu in all counters was good. I was there almost all the days in my stay in Singapore. Some food was a little too oily for my comfort but what the hell! I had a ball
5
Great food finds at Newton food centre. Came in around 1030pm and people was everywhere. Try the cereal prawns, satay and the oyster cake! Hawker style food dining at it's best!!!
4
We have been in Sibgapore for around a week and this is best of the 3 hawker centers we have visited.Maxwell road is very much with the feeling of the city and Lau pa sat has the character but this place is just relaxing. Many outside tables in a large area interspersed with trees. A good system for table service for both food and alcohol make it very easy
4
After walking around the city and being disappointed with our first attempt at dinner, my husband and I found ourselves arriving at Newton Hawker Center after midnight praying they would still be open and they were!!! We had so much fun talking with the locals, trying tons of different foods and drinking plenty of beer! We mad friends with the beer sale man who kept calling our pitchers "honeymoon beers" SO much fun, would definitely go back and recommend to everyone
3
I went there because my local friends suggested it, but apparently it wasn't all that great. I thought it was going to be pocket friendly because it's hawker food, but no. Then I thought well why not spend more as long as it's good, but not really. I could certainly find better-tasting food elsewhere. So yeah, maybe it was the wrong stall that I went to, or maybe the wrong food that I ate, I don't know, but I don't really feel like coming again. But most of the vendors were definitely friendly
4
My bf and I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to check out a real hawker center and were surprised to find it a little bit dead with many stalls closed. I thought it would be bustling all day long, but perhaps all the action takes place at night?I was really hesitant at first, because the vendors were really pushy, and the place looked a bit run-down and dirty, but we settled on a guy who waved a wriggly crab at us. We ordered a chili crab (male, because we weren't quite sure how to eat a female), spicy kang kong, black pepper beef, fried rice, and a large bottle of Tiger beer to share.Surprisingly, the food was DELICIOUS. I normally don't like the taste of chili, but the crab was really fresh and yummy. There is something to be said for seafood that is still alive when you order it.My only regret is that we omitted the mantou (steamed bread) due to the fried rice order. We should have gotten mantou to sop up all the chili crab sauce.So lesson learned: Looks may be deceiving. Despite the initial letdown due to the grungy exterior and plastic and styrofoam dishware, the food turned out to be fantastic!
4
A friend living in Singapore brought us here. She said it is of better quality than Nosignboard or Jumbo. and the price is much lower.We ordered the pepper crab, satay, rojak, etc. The food is good. So far it is not hot... eating crab, drinking beer, enjoy the local atomsphere... we loved this very much
5
A bit of a trip to get to, but well worth it. Take the MRT to Newton station and then it's a quick walk across the pedestrian bridge (you can almost follow your nose). When you come out of the station turn left through the park if you are facing the community centre. Look for a pedestrian overpass and you're there. Stalls begin to open around 1pm but is most popular at night (especially with the local student crowd). You'll be spoiled for choice and just about everything is delicious
4
Not sure how you choose between the vendors as they all look pretty much the same. From what I gather, there are 3 food groups:* seafood* non-seafood; and* oyster omelettes. Even the menus look the same. I like ithis place as it feels a bit raw (unlike the rest of prestine Singapore). And I'm talking about the raw atmosphere and not the food
4
My hotel was conveniently across the road from Newton so I enjoyed it fairly frequently, especially after a night of drinking it was pleasantly surprising to find it open at 3am. There's a great selection of food, however don't expect anything to be cheap as it is very tourist oriented.
4
You can get good food but be aware of the price of the dishes. For many of them, especially seafood, the price is not per dish but per kilo, so don't forget to agree on the price before you order. generally this food court is not the cheapest place where you can get food but the quality of it is pretty high
5
Had lunch with my friends at Newton and tasted Malayee & Chinese food. Great taste at highly affordable rate.Try the Chicken Satay, Noodle Soup, Popiah & Kahailan. It was great food and in a relaxed envioronment.
4
If you are new in town this is a great place to go for a variety of fresh seafood. Butter prawns are some of our favorites.
5
This stall selling best pure sugar cane juice...with topping....stall name called soon heng sugarcane....stalk owner mr steven ng....thump up must try...
4
Newton is a great place to get authentic Asian food at reasonable prices. Fun atmosphere with outdoor seating only. Huge range of food available. A real foodies place.
3
My family of four and I decided to have one of our dinner outings here after reading the write-out about the food centre under the Singapore Tourism Board's website.Our visit to the food centre was greeted by a group of vendors who were canvassing for business.After looking around a few of the food outlets, we sat at one of the tables in an open air environment and placed orders for 10 sticks of satay (barbecued meat with spicy groundnut sauce), sliced fish noodles, dry fried noodles, wet prawn noodles, fried rice, beef noodles, and sugarcane drink. When the food arrived, we were very disappointed about the taste. The food tasted very bland as if they were prepared in a hurriedly manner. What shocked us most is the total cost that we paid for a simple meal - SGD60-00 in total. We had dined out all the time since we were in Singapore for the past 4 days, but have never come across a food bill so exorbitant for simple hawker food. I am very sure the SGD60-00 paid could get us better quality food elsewhere
5
On my latest trip to Singapore I made the MRT haul across town to again visit Newton Circus. Have been doing so for 30 years since living in the city. Even when it moved temporarily for re-fit.Yes there are cheaper places in Singapore. Yes there is better seafood to be found (East Coast). But for under S$50 per person you can get very full on great seafood washed down with ice cold beer, in a vibrant, part local, part tourist atmosphere.Convenient to find (Newton MRT, follow signs and over footbridge).These days it seems all seafood stalls have a single menu and common prices, but there is still plenty of variety. Grab a seat wherever and the vendors will find you! My favourite is deep fried baby squid in chilli (also comes in honey) which I have rarely found elsewhere. Also sharks fin/crab meat soup - but expensive, indeed not sure if they still do it, given eco concerns. Prawns and crayfish are great staples.Major disappointment was Tsingtao beer is out, Heineken is in. Local Tiger beer is best of what is there now. I guess Newton Circus will always be my favourite, despite its modernisation
5
This place is more organised, more touristy and more expensive than other hawker centres in Singapore, and I am not sure I would have chosen to go there had it not been just 5 minutes walk from my hotel.Having said that, I dropped by last night for a late supper and was served two outstanding chilli-heavy dishes... one chicken and one beef. Yes, I know, it's a seafood stall, but that's what I felt like eating and the lady didn't bat an eyelid at my request to go off the menu a bit.After I finished eating the lady came over for a chat as it wasn't too busy at that time. Very pleasant all round.I can't rate the other stalls, but June at Stall 61 did an excellent job last night. I shall return
2
I have been visiting NFC since the 60's either as a European visitor to Singapore or when I lived and worked here. By the 80s I started to avoid this hyped-up place for three reasons that probably hold today - though I haven't been there for a few years.1. There are lots of hustling vendors. Vendors almost never hustle n other food centres. 2. Vendors assume they know what you as an ang moh want: (prawns and plenty of beer).3. Dishes are inevitably overpriced compared to almost any other food court or centres. 4. There are too many 'lost' tourists as fellow diners.5. It's not a particularly attractive spot.6. It doesn't feel authentic or Singaporean. But as a first time visitor to Singapore it will steel seem kind of tropically exotic and authentic. I'm perhaps too jaded
4
Been here twice for my favorite dish 'bbq giant tiger pawn and meat crab. Personally i'm a seafood lover, so i'm highly recommend to try the crab if you are a seafood lover like me. Also, newton food center has the best deal on seafood. Black pepper crab only cost around 50 something. Many others dishes like Lasa soup, butter pawn,etc. Overall, price are reasonable since Singapore is a high cost travel place.  Newton is a dinner dinning place, most stores won't open until 3 in the afternoon, and close up 3 in the morning. So if you would like to have a Sunday bunch or looking for food after partying, This is the place to be
3
The place came recommended as a good opportunity to try local food. It is organized as a series of stalls, many of them proposing almost the same menus.The atmosphere is a bit touristic, but the food is freshly made and the flavors are definitely more authentic then Those you find in many other establishments with a more classy look.Pay attention to the prices you can get surprises
4
Mrs Tan stall 70 - excellent food. Lemon Chicken !!!
Newton food centre is a great experience although quite a bit more expensive than most other food centres as it is a tourist destination.
4
I ordered prawn with sambal, stingray and kangkung balacan. My fave foods are Stingray Barbeque with sambal and kangkung balacan at stall #46
The sambal is very delicious . Don't forget to order Coconut Drink.
5
Great food, atmosphere, overall a fun place to chill out. Inexpensive hawker fare and a great variety to choose from. Singapore never sleeps when it comes to food.
5
Had a great outing there with a vast choice of seafood dishes to choose from. And the seafood tasted good partly because it was very fresh.Service was great and we didn't have to wait for long for our food to arrive despite of the full crowd. The order takers were efficient and very helpful when comes to selection of choices.We were particularly surprised by the cleanliness of the dining area. Price was moderate and we have no complains based on our good experience there
5
There are so many ifferent reports about this place - so we were a bit apprehensive - but we were very happy...had a gret evening with some great food - sure it may be more pricy than the Food Republic - but its an experience and we loved it. Average price per person - including one chilli crab - was about $ 15.00. The Chillie crab came to about $36.00 (not too shabby) Beers were cold...and as everyone says - finalise the price on the spot and dont feel obligated to any of the outlets - who give you a table - order from anyone. We got ours from a lady named MAY - stall 61 - great food all round - My wife had the Chilli crab, I had the Black pepper Beff, my son the Chicken wings (from another store) and Daughter the sweet and Siur Chicken - all very good...well worth it !

Ask around and you'll be told that Newton is mostly for tourists; taxi drivers will tell you that you can get better value at Lavender food court or somewhere else. OK, there's some truth in that. You could eat at Rasapura Masters at the Marina Bay Sands or in any of the numerous food courts in many shopping malls (we enjoyed Food Opera at Ion on Orchard Road). True. But it misses the point. Newton Food Center is also about the atmosphere and a way of eating, both of which are not going to be found so easily at the other places.I have been visiting Newton since the mid-1980s. Some things have changed but not a lot. In the past I've been able to enjoy meals at a table shared with local Singaporeans. If you have the chance to do that I recommend it. It's a great way to get out of the tourist bubble and interact with locals and actually learn something. And they may well recommend some great dishes to try.Everywhere you turn or look someone will be touting their stall and trying to get you to buy from them. Some will make a show of finding you a table and implying that since they did so you should feel obligated to buy their food. Ignore it all. Smile, be polite, and do exactly what you want without being hassled. By all means take the table that is offered, but all the tables are available to anyone and none belongs to any stall - you are free to choose any food from any stall and have it brought to whatever table you are using. Just tell the stall your table number and everything will be brought to you.Be careful with seafood. You need to go to the stall and choose what you are going to have and watch it being weighed and AGREE THE PRICE IN ADVANCE. If you do that you will not have any nasty surprises.Personal favorites: satay (of course); carrot cake (made from white radishes, egg and green onions); murtabak; curries; fresh squeezed sugar cane juice
2
My friend and I ordered a few dishes to share but weren't told beforehand that the seafood was sold at a price per kg. This was one of my first visits to a hawkers centre and I was disappointed at how expensive it turned out to be.
5
Singapore food is a must when you're in Singapore. Start here at Newton to experience the different local food cultures in Singapore from Indian food, Chinese food from different regions in China, Malay Muslim food, Western and of course the local cuisine. All of these at very, very friendly prices ex. a meal can cost between S$ 4- S$ 8 ( US$ 1 = S$ 1.20 ) Not much to dislike unless if you think the hot and busy atmosphere bothers you!!Remember all good & popular eating places in Singapore are always BUSY if not Don't go there!
5
As a devoted foodie I took a friend along to Newton Hawker Centre to meet a Malay girl I had gone to Uni with.The Malay girl ordered all of the food and boy were we happy with her choices of local food. Stingray, Chicken Rice, Oyster Omlette, Asian Veg in chilli and Garlic. It was all gorgeous and so fresh! Later on the trip we went back and I had the Singapore Chilli Crab which was possibly the single greatest thing EVER.The food in general is very cheap with most dishes being around S$4 each; though the Chilli Crab is more expensive.Singapore is a wonderful place and the food centres are a massive part of it
1
This is a tourist trap - mediocre hawker food at skyhigh prices targeted at unsuspecting tourists and filled with pesky touts.Does not do justice to the other honest hawkers operating in other hawker centres. It is a bad representation of other hawker centres too! There are no touts or overpricing in the other hawker centres in Singapore (except maybe the one at People's Park). Try the real local hawker centres located at the neighbourhoods to have a true Singapore hawker experience
4
A great place to take your out of town friends - food very tasty and the entire complex quite attractive and nicely laid out. Recommend approaching the stall which seems busiest, and ordering the most popular dish, if you are adventurous enough!
2
Still crowded and hot, and still with a lot of touts. Some stalls have decent food though, but the overall experience is a bit of a let-down.
1
The hawkers there tout way too much and it is annoying. Buses come in full of tourists. Avoid at all costs. Better is the Maxwell Hawker center: no touting, or Tekka Center in Little India
2
Its so aimed for the tourists. Its a hawker center and Singapore is full of wonderful in expensive Hawker centers I feel this is just ripping of the tourists. My suggestion is visit it have a drink but eat in another hawker centre where you will get the same food at half the price
1
I agree with other reviews here that you get hassled too much and that there is a feeling that the waiter's will make up some numbers for your final bill. There are now stickers on the tables advising customers to get a price for the total food before hand so that the waiters can't make up numbers. I was going to get the snapper but found out it was $35 at $6/100grams, I guess reasonable for seafood, but I'm in SEAsia, so I left and went to Lau Pa Sat food centre
2
This place is an institution in Singapore. They have a number of stalls selling various types of food and drink and because of Singapore's strict food standards, everything is prepared to top health levels. I went just for a late evening meal with my other half and we sat down at an out door bench table having attempted to be ushered to sit by almost every stall. That was a bit off putting to be honest but I guess they're only doing their job. We ordered some fairly ordinary food, rice, some seafood and greens and it was very nice. Had a lovely evening but when teh bill came, my eyes almost popped out of my head. The thing that got me was when he (the waiter) was writing up the bill, one of his friends from another stall came up and started to look over his shoulder and start smiling - like he was making up the numbers. Well either way we paid restaurant prices for an outdoor bench and plastic plates. I'll swerve this place from now on, which is a shame as I really like the buzz and ambiance. This place is also a big tourist trap which is also a shame as people are coming for genuine local cuisine. Left feeling conned
5
Having lived in Singapore for 3 years, Newton is easily my favorite place to go. Of course it's touristy and a little more expensive than other hawker centers. The people who complain about touts must not have travelled to other countries - its a part of life, and although it is one of the only places in Singapore you will find them, a simple 'no' will get them off you.Like anywhere else, make sure you know the price - order from the stalls, not the people. The food is great (especially since we know where to go), and once you get to know the people, they are happy to give you even better prices. The beer is cold and cheap (for Singapore), the food is varied, and the place is packed with a range of personalities most nights - what more could you want
2
The touting was very much over the top, really in your face. We ended up choosing a stall near the entrance as they didn't hassle us too much.The food was good but having now eaten at other hawker markets, it is quite overpriced.The beer was a good price and nice and cold - which was important as we were not used to the humidity of Singapore.There are better value for money hawker markets than Newton Circus - such as Tiong Bahru
1
You dont have to come all the way to Singapore for these food here..The food here have gone way COMMERCIALISED! Not just over-priced the quality is not worth the price, location and crown - in short OVERHYPED. Was a tourist place - hence its popularity... but seriously, you can get most good food anywhere in S'pore
4
For those who claim it is touristy, I don't disagree. However, it offers the experience of eating some great food at prices that pale in comparison to many of the restaurants in Singapore. Service isn't too aggressive, and we found the folks at the stall we ate very friendly. We ate the Chili crab along with a dish of tiger prawns. While most locals have favorite food courts elsewhere, the ease of access here for tourists makes it a decent stop. My only complaint would be the lack of variation in the stalls, most seemed relatively similar
2
Tourist spot. Somehow famous for seafood. Just be mindful to ask for price of seafood before ordering.
4
You will be harassed and probably ripped off but the food is fabulous and it's a fun cultural experience. Agree on the price before you order but other than that the chilli crab is a must!! Delicious!
2
Compared to most food in Singapore, this is very overpriced and the food at best is average.
1
Seafood no fresh and the price extremely expensive!
4
The last time we were at Newton Food Centre was 15 years ago and alot of the original character has gone but food is still delicious and fairly cheap. I still love this place for delicious food.
4
My friends treated me to a delicious and calorific dinner of chili crabs, crunchy baby squid, satay and fried rice and it was great! Great food, excellent company, young and old, yuppies and business people all having a good time in an open air food court. . . only in Singapor
4
We always try out hawker stalls. It gives a good balance to eat at the lower end aswell as the upper end.Can honestly say we had some of the BEST crispy duck ever!!!Cheap, hot, sweaty, noisy - great local atmosphere, hardly any tourists but we were made so welcome.I'd recommend this place to anyone. Hunt down the stall that does the crispy duck, crispy pork and rice/noodles
1
Singapore's food centers or hawker centers as we locals call them are supposed to be affordable simple local food.Unfortunately, Newton Hawker Center has evolved into an overpriced trap for tourists to come to Singapore. It is sad to read that sometimes, the poor unsuspecting tourists get fleeced and overcharged.A word of advice, is to know what you are being charged before you agree to order the food.The only saving grace for Netwon Food Center is that they are open till the early monring, espeically on Friday nights and weekends
5
A bit pricey considering they call it the hawkers stalls but superb sea food and more in a lively setting. Singapore chilli crab and tiger prawns are what we had, sugarcane juice, coconut water. Everything was wonderful. The loud soliciting by the various stall runners is a very minor irritant but if it wasn't for that you wouldn't be able to decide which one to try.Note that getting a taxi back on a busy night can be quite difficult; an easy way out is to book one over the phone and it will be there within 5-10 mins; that's what we did
4
If you happen to be in Singapore you cannot afford to miss Sea food at Newton.Crab in Black pepper sauce is messy but it is worth. One of the best seafood I ever had.As an Indian you can also enjoy a good coconut water drink.One visit to Newton will force you to revisit each day for at least one meal.It is also a reasonably priced joint. I recommend all seafood lovers should try this
2
A bit rowdy place. Weather too hot and humid for lunch here. Better to enjoy your food in an air-conditioned food court in shopping malls. Beware some stalls tend to overcharge. A good place to hang around for supper in late night.
1
A tourists trap! with sale people harrassing you every 2 seconds to pitch for their food stand... Not a good value, many more choices in the city, save yourself an horrible food experience
3
A little bit of a tourist trap but the stalls are generally delivering good quality food. It's gets a little better when you are being accompanied by a local.
3
really honestly... a place with this kind of reputation has just degraded over the years. We went at midnight and couldn't even find anywhere open with food that we wanted to eat and ended up at McDonalds instead.
3
tourist trap hahaha..but still, go ahead if you cant find any hawker centre near by
4
Authentic Singaporean Experience.check out the notice board outside for the most Singaporean dishes! (there are 9 of them)fab food, fab place for hustle and bustle. Dont expect posh. Expect bench style seating, outdoor eating and people everywhere!Fab place for good times, cheap Tiger Beer, ace Chili Crab and Satay.Can't go wrong!! (unless its raining!
4
I hesitated on going to this place because of the negative reviews I heard, especially about overpricing. But I decided to go anyway. On one stall I ordered satay (10 sticks for sgd5) and carrot cake (sgd5).On another stall, we were convinced by a woman to try her grilled prawn (sgd22 for 2 pcs) and 1 Chili crab (also for sgd22). She did mentioned the price beforehand as she said some stalls tend to overprice. It took around 20 minutes before these were served. All of these taste great. We, however did not order the buns, which usually is eaten with the crab as we know we cannot finished it anymore (1 order of 12pcs is sgd6).Nice place. Worth a visit again
5
Great little place - a collection of open air fish stalls. Browse around and take your pick. We went with Mrs Tan, who is a friendly and ebullient lady brimming over with enthusiasm for her food. Some may her a little over the top but maybe that's part of the fun. Had stingray wing, chilli prawns and steam vegetables with rice. Great food and good atmosphere. We went a little early for business reasons - I am sure the atmosphere improves as the night draws in. Also, try the freshly prepared cane juice with lime - very nice and knocks spots off coconut juice
4
Was there when a friend visited from the USA and for its location, and the fact that its got everything in one location, it can't be beat. It has reputation as a rip off joint sometimes but I think thats just limited to isolated instances. Go with locals who are in the know. Love the satay, grilled chicken and hokkien mee there - practically grew up with it!
4
A good example of a hawker food place to bring ur visitors. For visitor advise is to go with a local to simply ur visit. The experience with the latter will be very different. Some of the must tries are the carrot cake, hokkien mee, oyster egg, satay , popiah , duck rice and fish soup. Of course the standard Zi char is there but I would recommend to try the more unique food.
2
Overcharging for non locals, weigh scale for prawns was preloaded, lots of great hawker centers, don't go to this one.
5
Much better than the raffle market- cheaper, more relaxed, and from my family's very short experience, better quality. More locals and less tourists mean vendors have to stay on their toes to keep their regulars. Locals swear it is the best hawker market in Singapore.
4
This Hawker market has a good mixture of stalls, with good prices. Clean and not too pushy. Cheap beer. Good place for a singapore hawker market experience.
5
I'm friends with the people at Denmark Seafood for over 10 years. Their bbq stingray and the black peppered beef is very yummy.
3
In fact,there r other food centres that sell similar food at more reasonable prices.It's because it's a tourists spot,d prices r a bit steeper.
5
Yes this place is touristy but it still has some great food...and it's airy and fun. We love INDIAN PALACE Stall Number 44! they have wonderful butter Naan (its 2.90 a loaf but worth it) outstanding butter chicken, and great samosas...overally a bit pricey (this is Singapore) but outstanding food, friendly service and great quality! We love it
3
We were somewhat overwhelmed after the taxi drive dropped us off. Here are some useful tips1 . Be ready to be approached by all vendors especially the high margin seafood vendors2. Make a assessment of which stall appeals to you and it own in that area, as they will bring the food to you.3. Understand that all seating areas are public and you are therefore not obligated to order from the seafood vendors that thrust their menus at you. If you want satay, sugar cane juice and beer only then that's fine!4. If you want to order the crabs and cray fish, take your time to inspect it and do your calculations on price per weight. I still think I was missing a claw!5. if you have an open attitude and understand that it is somewhat touristy, you will have gun.Next time I will try the Maxwell hawker center for a bit more authenticity and value 
3
Newton have been a good food centre long ago. But it sucks nowadays. The hawker seem to be touting and they anyhow charge you for the price of the seafood. There are plenty other place that serve good seafood and the price are more acceptable that that charged at Newton
4
This was our first visit to a hawker centre and I have to admit we liked it. The place is crowded, probably way more touristic than other ones, hawker staff is constantly bugging you but the atmosphere is nice. We just ignored the hawker staff and ordered from different stalls and tried various dishes. The food is good and cheap so overall it was a success
4
Newton Circus as it is known is one of Singapore's older food centers and one that caters to a lot of tourists. When there are tourists there are also touts who try to steer you to over-priced seafood. Go to the stalls yourself to order and ask how much something will cost before you agree. There are a lot of inexpensive stalls with Thai, Indian, and other cuisines and in general, the food is pretty good there. It's also much calmer for lunch and there are no touts during the day.

The people working there is very aggressive, they "automatically" providing their menu to us, even we did not want to make any ordering in his restaurant.

A good combination of fresh sea food and good meat. I recommend...

food vendors seem more intent on making ridiculous profits from tourist than focusing on the quality of their food. Make sure you check and confirm the prices of the food you're ordering to avoid a shock when the final bill arrives.

Yes, Singapore has many better hawker centers and this one is rumoured to sometimes charge a bit more given its tourist popularity, but it is centrally located and actually a nice place to enjoy some classic Singaporean dishes (particularly skate) on a cool dry evening.

Years ago I would give only 1 star to this Food Centre. It does not get by with good food. Prices are not exactly cheap too. But it is a one-stop to taste the local delicacies without having to travel to too many places. Having itself near Orchard Road, I suppose the little price increment is a premium the tourists have to pay. For me, I'd only go in the middle of the night if I am in the vicinity and too lazy to think of where to get a bite

First time they send us there from hotel and when we said we left cause we thought here will be not nice.. Finally the next day we tried it and was worthing it for sure!! Very good Asian food and very good prices ! No need to take seafood or if u take look prices first as it can be expensive !

We come here on every trip to Singapore. Don't expect silver service, just good food. It is recommended not to buy the food from the guys that seat you, but I am more than happy just to select what I want to eat, rather than have to go to each of the vendors. The guys that seat you will have a menu with them, but you can order anything you like and they will arrange it for you. Sate and fried rice are our favourites. I recommend to sit in the middle, as seating closer to the stands is really hot

This isn't my first visit to Newton. I've been coming here since the late 70's but I think I've had enough.This time the only reason I visited was because it was very late, everything else was closed and the kids were hungry.I find it astonishing that in a country like Singapore, the authorities are unable to prevent two dozen touts from harassing and disturbing visitors.Forget the food. In between fighting off the touts, weighing your food to ensure you're not cheated and double checking the price of every item, who has time to taste the food?Newton is an embarrassment for Singapore. Shut it down, tear it down, but do something

Ignore everyone trying to persuade you to sit at "their" table - the tables are for everyone! Don't allow yourself to be bullied. Take your time, wander around the food stalls and order from the ones you fancy, satay from one, curry from another, laksa from yet another. Good, inexpensive food (probably avoid ordering seafood here, as it is over-priced) and a great atmosphere. Bring some tissues, as napkins are non-exisent and the eating can get messy! Enjoy

We were told to go here by fellow Aussies. We caught a cab from Clark Quay and it cost about $10SGD. It was amazing, felt like we were in Shenzhen being hassled to eat. We were told to go to a stall 70 as they had the best seafood. Oh my, best it was amazing. We ordered 8 prawns the size of lobsters, 2 noodle dishes, 1 green dish, Black pepper crab for $130AUD. It was very well worth it, something like this back home would easily cost about $300! The assistant was very attentive to our needs. Very good service. Kept on saying yummy yummy in your tummy. And kept on showing us business cards from all over the world. As we were on holidays we didnt carry them so if you remember bring along and she will put in the cardholder.This particular stall opens from 5pm until 1am. The rest Im not sure, but amazing, like amazing seafood. Get some soda water afterwards you will need from overeating!We caught the MRT back to our hotel. MRT is very close

Went there on a Sunday Afternoon for a quick bite, only some stalls were open. Decided to have the Oyster omelette and Carrot cake, great hangover cure but had better ones previously.
1
overpriced, too much touting and not much good food. it servers more like a tourist destination than a place for locals. i would definitely not recommend this to anyone. the only stall i wouldn't mind having is the XO ba chor mee, but i wouldn't take the effort to go there just to have that
4
First night in Singapore and this was our choice of destination for dinner! The food was great and came out really quick! Pay on arrival of food at table. We tried the satay stingray, which was very tender and soft! Highly recommend. We also had an array of other delicious food: a good first impression of Singapore food! Quick and easy to find a table also
5
My family and I went to the Newton Food Centre. We ate many kinds of seafood there. They were delicious. The food offered here is reasonable and suitable for both vegetarian or non vegetarian. I highly recommmend this place for anyone who'll be going to Singapor

Fantastic location for great hawker stalls. As you enter, you will be approached by a vendor who will wait on you. They collect the food and drink from various stalls. Try different dishes including satays, prawns and of course the famous Singapore chilli crab. Take the Newton MRT. Best way to get around in Singapore and cheap. You will not be disappointed
5
The best chili crab in Newton! The owner, May (or you can call her ta tse or big sister), is quite friendly and generous in her servings plus unlimited rice upon request. Prices are extremely reasonable. Will definitely come back on my next visit to Singapore!!! Yum!!
2
Everyone said you had to try the Chilli Crab so I did at Newton Circus and regretted it for the next week. Be very careful what you eat as I ended up at the doctors and on antibiotics and immodium. If you are going to get sick then Singapore is the place to do it as the Doctors are great, not expensive and dispense medication on the spo

I loved the vibrant feel, the aroma of cooking, the hawkers pushing you to sit and eat at their stall. After conducting an exploratory lap of the stalls, ignoring the persistent requests to sit at a table, we finally settled on one that quite frankly looked exactly like all the others. My friends had a particular place they always frequent but on this occasion it was closed so it was to be a new experience for us all. Well I got exactly what I wanted, Singapore chilli mud crab, a prawn half the size of my arm, bread, greens and a big beer and I was a very content man. My friends agreed it was better food, better serivce and better priced than their usual and will only go back there. Unfortunately I paid no heed to the name but I know exactly where it is for next, about the 5th stall on the left with the train station to your back

I've been going there few times, whenever I go down to Singapore. Most of the stalls offered very similar dishes,mostly seafood. There are still few good ones there but you need to know which are the stalls. I find that the place is more popular for tourist although one of the reason is that it is nearer to Orchard and few areas, which makes it convenient
3
I think it is one of very few places in Singapore, when stall holders are jumping on you, trying to sell their "very special" food. The place got some reputation by being a good location for sea food, but I would rather say, it is tourist oriented and overpriced. To be honest, the food wasn't bad, but it was not a something really outstanding too..
5
Loved the grilled sting rays. Fried rice was awesome as well as the veggie dish. Price was reasonable. Loved the delivery system. Would definitely comeback if in town.
4
Sitting outside and picking whatever food you want, from seafood to noodles, from juice to beer.. very local but tasty..
4
Newton Food Court is a seafood lovers heaven~~ yes it pricey in Singaporean standards and its catered towards foreigners and tourists, but the quality of food and the atmosphere outside on a nice windy day in Singapore is priceless. Make sure u go at night time and on a very good day to enjoy the most from it
4
The most famous hawker center. Not the best, but excellent seafood and so many other great things to try.Much cleaner than before, but be wary of tourist ripoff prices. Some stalls will try to charge you higher prices if you look like a tourist (70-80% of the crowd).Be adventurous and try some new things, many excellent stalls here. This is a place to relax and enjoy with friends.Ignore the aggressive touts and sit and order where/what you like. Tip: the more aggressive the tout - the worse value food/drink

ok... it was stupid of me to drink a freshly prepared drink... but I had recalled the very clean conditions and wonderful food when I visited 17 years ago. It is not the same today and we were quite disappointed. I was so thirsty after walking from the Newton MRT and purchased the drink at the first stall on the right as you enter the large square court (after getting off the bridge over the road). It didn't look clean but I didn't think I'd have a problem.. big mistake.. We had no problem with previous meals at other food courts like Lau Pa Sat, Food Republic, and Takashimaya basement

Although there are a lot of tourists at Newton Hawkers, the majority of customers seem to be locals. The prices are many times higher than at the neighborhood food-courts. Nevertheless, my kids enjoy coming here. A lot of happy people. And a lot of favorite dishes such as pepper beef and chicken rice. We always get lime juice from one of the several drink vendors. Although it's unscientific, the vendors seem cleaner than than those at the neighborhood courts

It has been more than 15 years since I last visited Newton food-court. It's a pale comparison to the great food that were served back then. The Newton today catered basically for tourists, with 70% of the stalls serving seafood dishes. There were hardly any good local fares. I am of the opinion that neighbourhood food-courts in established suburbans like Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Serangoon and Katong served better and more authentic hawkers fares. If you love your food as much as I do... I would highly recommend that you give this place a miss

This is the place to get a great meal at a very cheap price, just be wary that you will be persued by people trying to get you to buy from their stall, we found the best thing to do was to walk around,see what you want and then find a table close to the hawker you are going to buy from, take your time and enjoy the atmosphere, its good just to watch what is going on around you, we had stingray in a chilli sauce with a couple of Tiger beers, cant wait to get back there in May next year

I was in Singapore for a week with my wife and we went to Newton Food Centre near our hotel. I had previously read up about the types of food there and noticed most of the stalls served very similar foods - BBQ seafood, oyster omelette, carrot cake... For a first timer we sampled some of this and it was very good. A few nights later, a local friend took us there again for dinner and this time amidst all the BBQ seafood stalls, we had the pleasure of trying some truly splendid and different food that was not aimed at the tourist community. Our friend recommended that we try the food at this stall Curry Nasi Lemak, a traditional malay coconut rice and assorted curries and fried foods. And we were really taken by surprise by the flavours. If you are ok for spicy foods, give this stall a try. We had curry chicken which was awesome, a dried beef curry, spring rolls, and a really fantastic honey sesame chicken which isn't always available (as told by the stall owner). You can request for it, and they'll whip up a hot fresh portion for you. I'm from the States and the asian restaurants don't come close to the flavours and spices used here. Prices are a fraction of what you would pay at the BBQ stalls, a dish costing about US$2 each versus US$30-US$50 at the BBQ stalls. Give it a try if you are looking for something different and authentic flavours, and not targeted at tourists.Beware though, their homemade chilli sauce is amazingly spicy... but full of flavour. Hope you find this review useful

The food here is fantastic if you find the right stalls, i last came here in 2006 and decided to go again as my wife and i loved the food we always went to the same stalls for our food and drinks, unfortunatly i never made a note of the name or stall number!!!! But if the taxi drops you off in the car park which they usually do walk towards the archway and the second stall on the right of the archway is where we ate.I have read other reviews which say its a tourist trap and too pricey but compared to many outlets on boat quay & clarke quay it is cheap and as a tourist just ignore any people trying too tout for business a(a shake of the head and wave of the hand usually does the trick.)The food is out of this world sweet & sour pork ,swordfish, kai lan squid,fried rice thats the food we ordered everytime and he even rembered us from 2006!!The gentleman who owns the stall doesn`t harass you like the other stall holders so just go to his stall and point out where your sitting he will bring over the menus (all pictures you can just point at it`s that simple.)If you get a chance go and try it its some of the best food you will taste in Singapore!!With probably the nicest most humble man at Newton circus
