Came here for a pot of tea, but pretty clear it is a brunch spot. Good selection of teas, and was rather quiet when I was here, but looks like it has a tendancy to get packed.
5
These folks really take their coffer seriously. First time I've seen machines being calibrated so that customers can enjoy the full coffee flavour of their selection. They also have a nice selection from some micro-breweries that I have been trying lately. Well done!
3
Too expensive to be honest, but at least food is good. Try their bottled coffee, quite unique especially if you enjoy lattes.
5
We were there for breakfast. Food was very delicious, staff was great. We enjoyed the time we spent there a lot.
4
Nice little cozy corner at Prinsep St. Very good drinks menu and waffle selection was good too. Waffle was fresh and not over done. Delicious! Parking can be a real problem in this area.
Service and staff were friendly and fast.
4
Don't take an AEROPRESS coffee, unless you like your coffee watery.
This place is more for lunch than for breakfast - a salmon dish feels a bit heavy on an empty stomach. Nevertheless, this hipster place offers great food with a wide range of coffees.

I have had their coffee brewed by the syphon method with the Kenya AS top Asali beans and it was delicious. I do hand pour coffee at home, so it was nice to have it brewed differently and by someone else. A little treat! Their buttermilk waffles with greek yogurt and fresh fruit was pretty tasty. The waffles were fluffy and crispy, just the way I like it. I would come back here. Place has a cute interior as well, open and industrial with cool lighting and plants.
4
Tucked away at the end of Prinsep Street in a old building, this restaurant with its cosy setting is a good place for breakfast or brunch with friends and family in the weekend. They serve serious coffee as understand the owner is a renown barista.We ordered salmon salad and avocado toast with egg. The sweet potatoes fries are very good too
4
Visited here a few times with a friend who's a regular customer. The salmon was delicious and cooked perfectly. Fast forward to my next visit, I tried their soft shell crab burger. The salted egg sauce was not enough, and it was overpowered by the veggies which were doused in a very acidic dressing. Would stick to the salmon next time
3
Way overhyped, thanks to Instagram. While the food is presented well, the preparation, texture and taste are horrible.I had salted egg chicken wings. First the chicken was fried for too long in hot oil that instead of golden brown, it was very dark brown. Naturally deep fried items are oily hence, the oil ooze out with each bite. Usually the sauce will be the hero to save the day, however this too was a disappointment. It was bland, with a distant egg yolk flavour. I also had the wagyu rump steak. The foie gras that came along with the dish was perfect. The condiments did not work well with the foie gras but you can just leave them untouched. The wagyu was cooked to the desired doneness, which was the only good part of the steak. Steak cuts are cut across the muscle grain so that when it is served, the muscle grains are in line with your knife and you cut parallel to it. The rump steak was served with the grains across the plate so good luck trying to slice that meat. Oops, I forgot to mention that there is no steak knife, so really, good luck.The had the pancake for dessert and wow, the dessert was really really good. It was a good portion, fluffy inside and all the condiments worked well together. Service was average. Staff was friendly but reactive instead of proactive. I had to walk out to the counter on two occasions to get some service as endless waving seems to not work. Probably due to safety, staff seem to walk with their eyes on the floor at all times. My overall impression, do go to Curious Palette for desserts but stay clear of the appetisers and mains
5
From the outside doesn't look like much, but very worth eating here. Good food, well presented and good service. Very much recommended.
5
Funky cafe with awesome tunes, attentive staff and cool decor. I enjoyed the salmon brunch and delicious coffee.
5
Really love the interiors of this place. Every corner is instagrammable and the coffee is awesome! Try the waffles there, decadent and amazing.
2
Went there are 530pm and they are still serving the brunch menu! Dinner menu only start at 630pm. Tried their salted egg wings but the sauce was so dry and don't have the taste of salted egg. So dissapointted by that dish. However the truffle fries was good. Tried the soft shell crab burger, only got a bunch of vegetable and 1 soft shell crab. No sauce in the burger(at least give some mayo!) .
5
Loved the food and atmosphere here. Friendly waiters and waitresses. What intrigued me the most is the twists they added to their food menu. And their tea cakes are delicious. Had the Thai Milk Tea Loaf with ice-cream which is a must try. Definitely recommended if you are in Singapore. It was so good that I went back for breakfast the next day and true enough I wasn't disappointed. I had the waffles which was again delicious! Looking forward to my next trip to Singapore to visit curious palette again

Food is pretty to look at and quite tasty (cakes were great), but not very filling. The matcha and salted egg yolk cake was the standout for me- dense and rich, but pity we couldn't really taste the salted egg yolk. Just wish the food was heartier as portions were on the small side.
2
Terrible dinner experience and would not go again.First, we tried to order Oreja de Cerdo (pig's ears), a side dish. The waitress asked if we aware that it was pig's ears (we were), as it is very seldom ordered. I ordered the crab salad and my friend ordered the Wagyu burger. The waitress asked her how she would like the burger. She said medium rare. The waitress came back and told us that because it was so rarely ordered, Oreja de Credo was actually not available! I was quite taken aback, why don't they just remove it from the menu if they are unable to serve it?I didn't like the stool, it was very wobbly. My crab salad, and the croquettes, were good, but my friend's burger looked extremely unevenly cooked and like it was raw on the inside (it was a very thick piece of beef).We complained to the waitress at the end of the meal. She said that this was what medium rare burgers was like. She said that it was slow cooked in sous vide (it doesn't look like it) before being grilled. If you are serving customers undercooked meat that was not of the highest quality, they should warn customers. Alternatively, simply cook all burgers the same way and don't ask customers how they would like their burger if they did not specifically say they want it medium rare; I've never actually been asked that. She gave my friend a 10% discount off her burger. The bill was still way overpriced.Finally, the place was shortstaffed and we had to wait for quite a while to get our bill in

Curious Palette has an unassuming street front but it's worth tracking down. Inside is all industrial design chic, art, open kitchen, good music and coffee machines. Coffee (2 flat whites each) was simply excellent and breakfast (smashed avocado, scrambled eggs) also good. Service was prompt and responsive. Only negative? No wifi. As good as any Melbourne cafe, and that's a big compliment
3
Was really looking forward to this one as it had amazing reviews. Don't get me wrong - it's still an okay place to have breakfast. The place looked really impressive and we expected really good coffee going in. We got a couple of weak flat whites and food that (for the price) was just okay. We'd love to give the place another try in the future, though
4
Wonderful , beautifully designed casual cafe next to some rather rough around the edges bars. Great brunch with a modern twist. Lots of staff so service was swift. My husband had a delightfully prepared salmon, with avocado and haloumi . I ha da simple poached eggs on sourdough. My daughter lucked out with a wonderfully fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside waffles with maple syrup. All in all great and if you are a coffee drinker this is your place. The only down side is the level of the music, just a tad too loud but the crowd maybe a decade or more younger than us- being 40 :-)
5
Popped by here for a business meeting in the afternoon. Great ambience, natural lighting, good playlist! Overall, great place to chill at or have meetings.
Had a cup of magic - double shot. Really great coffee here as well!
5
Second time to this cafe. Had the sweet potato fries and waffles and they are great.
Nice cosy place to chill in the afternoon with friends and while the time away...
4
I visited here with my sister to have breakfast. We have ordered Eggs on Toast(scrambled eggs + Ciabatta), Waffles with greek yogurt and Hazelnut Hojitea cake. Eggs on Toast was so simple and tasted a bit bland to me. The harmony of waffles and greek yogurt was not really good. But, Hazelnut Hojitea cake was nice. Moreover, the service of every staff was wonderful and the atmosphere of cafe was very nice. I will visit once again soon to try their coffee
4
The place is easy to miss as it's not that big and sits in the middle of bars and cafes and the signage is not really noticeable. I had ice americano and nutella cake - they only had 2 types of cake maybe because it was still early. But I didnt regret the cake, it was yummy and my daughter loved it
4
Curious Palette is a charming little cafe with a homely design and feel tucked away at the end of Princep Street. They have some great cakes and nice a simple but refined breakfast, lunch and dinner menu. If you are looking for a comfy, and cozy atmosphere Curious Palette is a great place to catch up with friends.
5
Being from Melbourne we are spoiled for choice when it comes to brunch and cool cafes and generally struggle to find cafes that can meet our brunch expectations when overseas but Curious Palette did not disappoint. Great little cafe with trendy decor and food was fantastic. Lots of different options other than your standard 'eggs and bacon'. Some reviews have said the service is not the best but we didn't find that to be the case.
5
A lovely cafe with beautiful ambience. We ordered mushroom chowder, Portobello with truffled eggs, and truffle fries. For drinks we had Scotch tea and fairy Blossom tea. Particularly recommend the chowder, but everything else was really good too. Portions are generous, and table service is friendly. We were sadly too full to try the delicious looking cakes on display - one day I might try the 'macha with salted egg' cake
4
Went there twice for breakfast. Very chilled place and great food. Staff are friendly the only odd thing is that they refused to swap a sauce for another one, which comes on the side (hollandaise for tomato relish). Literally had to swap the small bowl for a different sauce but apparently that was it allowed. Nevertheless their food was good, even if quite pricey. Also it's a shame they don't have a wifi for their customers.
3
Nice place, good juices, good coffee, menu has some good items, some less good. I don't like the croque madame with brioche sweet bread. The pulled pork dish will deserve less meat, an additional e.g. And more sundries tomato to balance a bit. Efficient service, fast and ok staff.
3
known for their coffee and good food, but was disappointed by both of it. might be my personal preference, went once and it really isn't that good an experience. might come by again when i have time to try other items and give the place a second chance. ambiance is good tho
3
Such a nice place, really an instagram'able cafe. Not the most extensive menu, but good food even if not out of the ordinary.
5
Curious Palette is the best place to chill and dine at the same time. They have great interior and superb food.
4
Very enjoyable coffee there with a varied menu. A bit pricier than average brunch but i like the light in the restaurant. Staff is friendly and most dishes are good. Not bad if you live nearby and are looking for a easy brunch.
5
The service was great, food was not too bad. love the portioning of the eggs on toast (lots of eggs) and the beautifully arranged berry ricotta hotcake
4
The service was great, and the waiters were cheerful. They have a wide variety of food but I only tried the waffles which was extremely delicious! Definitely would come back here to try more food.
5
This is the must cafe to visit when in singapore!! Good food and great taste, the coffee, flat white is awesome !! Suitable for brunch and lunch !!
2
To be fair, the environment of the place and the service of the crew should be commended. We ordered 1. Curious Breakfast, 2. Spam Fries and drinks. However, we were really disappointed with the food presented to us. The spam fries was definitely a good snack. As for the curious breakfast at $24.90, we expected more from such a steep price (ref picture). What was offered instead was a disheartening meal in small quantities that do not complement each other well. The churitzo patty was somewhat sour, the sausage had all sorts of weird spices going on, the salad wasn't at all seasoned, the fried cheese balls didn't fit in to the "breakfast plate" at all and there was a jam alongside with the bread that was more sour than sweet? The saving grace was the half boiled egg placed on top of the avocado. Other than that, the entire combination was really not alright. Conclusion; probably back only for coffee in future
5
We tried Curious Breakfast Plate and Eggs on Sourdough Toast. Both of them were very delicious. Long black coffee was perfect. Service was very quick and all staff were really professional and friendly. Decoration was very nice, comfortable; good music. Try Curious Palette, you will not regret
4
Dropped in for a late afternoon coffee. While we didn't eat the food looked very interesting on the other tables. The coffee was excellent- I had a double ristretto with milk (Magic?). The coffee had excellent body and aroma with low acidity and the milk was the right temperature. One of the best coffees in Singapore. 5 for the coffee, 4 overall as service could improve.
4
This popular, attractively decorated and modern cafe/restaurant is about a five minute walk from the Ghoby Ghaut MRT station. We went there for the espresso coffee, which was very good - there are real baristas here! However, you can also choose from quite a wide selection of breakfast items, pastas, sandwiches, burgers, cakes and salads. Try the gula malaka waffle - yummy but don't count the calories. Rainbow cake goes down well with many kids, any left goes down well with the adults too. And I liked to smoked duck salad. Prices were reasonable by Singapore standards
4
This coffee has a very nice atmosphere and the pancakes are good. I will recommend for a coffee and sweets. I tried the meals and it was quite disappointed. I will not recommend then for a proper brunch. Just for a coffee!
5
parking is a problem, but it's worth the hassle! I felt like I had discovered a hidden gem. The unassuming front door opens to a corridor like interior that's cosy and inviting. Feels like being in a friend's home. The coffee was excellent, and so was the beer. The staff were friendly and helpful. Had pancakes (or French toast?!) and it was really good. Looking forward to my next visit
5
Curious Palette is conveniently located near Dhoby Ghaut MRT and SOTA. The windows and furnishings make for a bright space and light atmosphere. The bottom floor was packed at 2pm on Sunday afternoon, but the wait staff opened up tables for us on the second floor, which was much quieter. I loved the food and would recommend the hand-pulled pork and the homemade chai latte-super yummy with seven spices! My friends and I devoured a banana berry waffle with a scoop of vanilla ice cream-a sweet way to finish off our meal.
4
Curious palette has become a hangout place for my friends and I as its near our school. I love the ambience and the place is bright & airy. The food is also great- I'd highly recommend the truffle fries or buttermilk waffles- and they have an interesting selection of cakes which are delicious (Including the truly Singaporean 'ondeh-ondeh' cake and earl-grey lavender cake, both of which I would highly recommend). Certain items such as the truffle fries come in big portions so they can be shared between 3-4 people!
3
While the food sounds amazing on the menu, I was a bit disappointed by what was on the plate. My croque madame didn't have béchamel and the dish came with a salad, which had no dressing. The service was quite messy as well. I got my drink, then my friend got his food, then I got mine and at last they brought my friends drink. The decor and atmosphere are really nice though!

A hipster cafe nestled behind behind Selegie enclave. The coconut mango cake was passable, they could have used fresh cream. We like the waffle with vanilla ice cream and berry compote, just the soothing Sunday treat we needed. The ambience is casual, cool and yet homey
4
Curious Palette is a cafe bistro, situated along Princep Street and i guess alot of you might missed it as the signboard is placed at a place where you will not easily get to see it. I was looking for the signboard to snap a photo so that you guys can easily locate it but only to realized that the signboard is written on a mini chalkboard, placed beside the main door.Pulled Pork on Sourdough, $18.90, with purple cabbage, arugula, poached egg, semi-dried tomatoes, fried shallots and hollandaise. The pork was surprisingly quite tender and juicy which we quite like it.Read more about our dining experience on darrenbloggie.co

I missed the place and went over to another block (sunshine plaza) but i managed to use goggle map to locate it.I was early so ordered coffees and a puce of rainbow cake. Coffee is up to standard. They are a lot of choices for cakes. The staff keep on refilling..Later we try the pancake ice cream, lemon cake(? Not ordered by me) and smoked duck salad. They were nice..It was 2pm with strong lunch crowd still..If you are around the area, check it out.I highly recommend the shop to put a bigger logo outside the small thiny entrance to make it visible for first timer like me and my kid to find the sweet coffee makan joint.

Read quite a few reviews before settling on this place to try out their all day brunch! It's really good. The decor is so cozy, offering cushions n bench seats (my fav) and standard cafe table setting.I ordered their brunch menu, smoked salmon with sourdough, it took me less than 15 mins to polish off the plate. the poached eggs are perfectly done and love the combination of crunchy walnuts. This place is a pleasant find as I need a cozy place for old Friend chit chat on a wkday afternoon over a cup of coffee. Do try out their sweet potato truffle fries, the serving is generous! It's not too hard to locate the place as I read online. Alight at Dhoby Ghaut mrt and head towards hotel rendezvous direction. Once reached, head straight down towards the mr bean cafe or a line of shophouse (opposite Pomo). It's located level one of the shophouse. You will see a white chair outside the shop that's spelled the shop name. A place that worth the calories n Instagram worthy food pics
5
Very nice and chill place. Ate breakfast there twice during our 4 days trip to Singapore. The place is rather hip, and is quite westerly inspired. The food is great, and so is their coffees! Perfectly temperated, and for me, a perfectly balanced blend. The staff is also the most friendly staff I have encountered so far, so all in all, go there and get a great start on your day
2
We ordered iced brew coffee and it was such a disappointment. On the other hand food is good esp the soft shell crab burger.
5
My third time here. The brunches never fail my tastebuds. Had Hand Pulled Pork and its infamous Truffle Sweet Potato Frieds, bon appetit. Poached egg always bounce with its golden yolk flows.
3
Waffles were fantastic - must try! we ordered truffle fries, chicken tenders and nachos - all were pretty big sized, great for big groups. But menu was quite small as we went after 7pm. Not a lot of options and is quite expensive.
4
We went during dinner and although I admit that it took us some time to find the place due to the very discrreet signage outside the restaurant. Once inside, I couldn't be happier. The food was good and the servings are generous. I love the Truffle Fries and the highly 'instagrammed' Berry Ricotta Hotcake. All in all, it was a delightful experience eating her
5
Popped in here after being recommended. The service on arrival was great, friendly guys who were very attentive and made sure we were looked after. We ordered 2 coffees, the pulled beef and the sweet potato fries. The portions were huge, but we were happy with that as we arrived starving. Everything was tasty and delicious. DÃ©cor is fresh, white and it is a comfortable place to sit for an hour or two. Only downside for travellers is there is no wifi. Otherwise great! We will return
3
I visited around 17:30 on a Saturday afternoon so it wasn't as busy as always and managed to get seated straight away, albeit at a counter which faces a wall! The soft shell crab burger and sweet potato fries were nice, but nothing to write home about. The service was ok, nice chilled atmosphere and price was on par with other nice places in Singapore (which doesn't necessarily mean it's good value). I would probably visit again if I'm in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip out there
3
I had their wine poached waffle and berry ricotta hot cakes. The waffle was sour and not so crispy and generally its dry. So for the price big no.The berry ricotta was the disappointing one. It isn't a hotcakes or what,more like they should name it a big muffin or a big cake. It feels like finishing one big birthday cake by yourself.trust me after you eat this for a few bites, you'll get so sick of dessert.Expensive overall:
5
Perfect lazy Sunday as we had breakfast at 5pm. The all day breakfast ends at 6pm and dinner starts at 6.30pm.Portions are rather big and it was good to share. The truffle fries and Sweet Potato truffle fries are delicious . Decor is really quirky and stylish. Great place to go with date or friends.
5
Very cute and bustling brunch and lunch venue (the do dinner too). Wide menu of usual fair (pancakes, eggs many ways, pulled pork, healthy veggie options) but done exquisitely. Restaurant is bright and Morden in a long first floor space. This place was packed when I went with an amazing smell of truffles, fresh fruit and just a hint of coffee. Awesome
3
Not a wide variety for dessert, but the waffles very light and fluffy The chocolate cake wasn't the best I've ever tried... Pretty classic and nothing impressive.The service wasn't the best neither. My cappuccino arrived after we finished the dessert and were about to leave.Still an ok place to hangout as the place closes late
