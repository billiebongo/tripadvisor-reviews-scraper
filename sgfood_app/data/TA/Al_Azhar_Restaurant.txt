Been here a number of times and thought the food was decent. Parking can be a nightmare as the place is always crowded.

Review by DrSim001. Good food. Best thing is that it is open 24-hours. No Air-Conditioning. Hygience is basic. Ate Mee Goreng. Usually I buy back home as place is crowded during dinner. Regards DrSim001.

This is an awesome place for local food. Cheap, tasty and freshly prepared food. I've eaten here on many occasions and recommend it highly. The whole fish dishes, the noodle dishes, and the wide array of drinks are some of the things worth trying.
3
The food is very good here. But, the environment is not really clean. The service is good. The price is affordable and worth.

Review by Dr Sim. Some dishes are better than others. Not consistent. Service is fast but basic. No air-conditioning. Indian Muslim food is quite good. Naan is good. Curry is generally good. Roti John is good. Tourists can visit. 24 hours. Regards Dr Sim

Wife and I visited this restaurant in the morning. I ordered an onion Prata and she ordered a naan. Drinks were Pakistan Chay and Horlicks. In the afternoon my wife and I both experienced a day long bout of diarrhea. The food here is decent but not worth the discomfort from diarrhea

One of the best I would say. This place serves all kinds of food Indian,Malay, Kind of mixed western, etc. Real spicy and awesome food. While it's spicy the food is not very hot (chilly) so no one will have problem. Especially non veg eaters would love this place. There are veg options also. Reasonably priced. For 5 to eat full to the stomachs dinner shouldn't cost more than SGD 90. Service also very fast and very good. Don't miss

This place is great. Service is quick and the food is amazing, so so tasty. It's not touristy which indicates to you how good it is with the amount of locals there. I had the butter chicken and tissue paratha. It was amazing. Go and try it
4
The place is always crowded, the reason is of-course the great food and at anytime you are hungry. Menu has lot of varieties to choose from Indian, Malay, Western etc and same lots of variety for drinks and desert. We have been here multiple times mostly late night and they have never disappointed us.

This is not my first bad experience but the latest was my worst! Went there at 10am for breakfast. Waited super long before a server noticed us, tried ordering roti prata but was told by the server there is no more roti prata. we looked around and everyone was eating roti prata, even the next table was ordering roti prata but was told the wait was 20 mins. I was ok waiting but our server did not give us that option and insisted no more roti prata! we had no choice but to leave. On another note, the restaurant is very very very dirty
4
Good food, usual midnight supper place. Good service, crowded at night though.
Not cheap, especially the meat/fish.
Imho only the roti stuff is really good. The rest is like, youve paid the price.
5
Wide selection of food and reasonably priced. Been many times and not had a bad experience yet. Highly recommended.
5
love the maggie goreng here, and they serve decent pratas and other indian food as well. service here is pretty decent, hence it has grown exponentially in the last 10 years, overtaking Al Ameen, which had rude servers and had often over-charged diners.
4
This is a big, cheap and cheerful Indian, Malay and Fusion diner, that was busy and buzzing on the lunchtime that we visited. There is tremendous choice on the menu. Our lamb biriani, vegetable curry and naan were all fresh and delicious.
3
Came here for lunch today whilst visiting Woodlands. The food was actually pretty good. Took a while to arrive but all was good in the end. The mango lassi was disappointing, but I liked the aloo gobi curry and the butter chicken.
4
The roti-john is one of the best that I have ever tasted.
Naan and butter chicken is another 'must-try'. You won't regret it.
My favorite drink from this place is the homemade lime juice.
3
Due to the commencement of Downtown Line train service to this part of the island, many commuters will find easy to come to this renowned restaurant to have their meal.Had my "Murtabak Kambing" (Flat-grilled Pancake Stuffed with Mutton fillings) with a cup of "Teh Halia" (Ginger Tea with Milk) on a lazy day.Other than those mentioned, there are plenty of options to choose from. Can be crowded at times
4
On the way to Bukit Timah from the metro we noticed this place was popular with local families, so we went there after our walk in the reserve. It was really nice, good and abundant food, large choice (although several things on the menu were not available), and fast service. They do not accept international credit cards, though
5
Al-Azhar is my favorite place to eat when I'm in Singapore. It can get crowded, but the food quality is always great. The butter chicken is my favorite. I am very happy the Downtown Line now has a station nearby! I have never had bad service, although occasionally some dishes are not available.So, when you're in the area, take the MRT down to Beauty World and give it a try. I highly recommend it
4
Has jet lag, was hungry for local delights but it was 2:30. Googled and found this place. Vast selection of Indian, Thai, Malay etc. was mind blowing the amount of choice at such an hour. Got a mutton murtabak, wife got a veggie murtabak. Very tasty and the juice as well. Will definitely return to try out the other stuff which also looked yummy
4
Good quantity..
Outstanding quality..
Spicy enough, But won't burn you..
Cost is around $8..
Must try if you are looking for Indian food..
4
Almost every year we visit Singapore for a couple of months and every year we have to visit Al-Azhar a couple of times.Why? The food is great, the price is right and they are always open. So we come for the Roti Prata for breakfast and de Bryani or other Indian dishes for diner.They have never failed us in the past 10 or so years so i would definitely recommend them. For tourist, just go for it you will not feel sorry about it
3
I got to say this first. Never order fish and chips. Its just some fish burger fillet. The place is a little hot and very crowded but not too bad if you dont know what you want. Theres a huge variety of food you can choose from. Indian/chinese/malay/western etc. Naan was not too bad butter chicken too sweet.
4
Al-Azhar opened an Italian and Mediterranean Restaurant just along side the old Al-Azhar indian resto in Bukit Timah. Oh my the lamb biryani is so delicious and tender. They also have steaks and wraps. I already ate here 2x and am surely gonna go back for more
4
We had been here a couple of times and always enjoyed it. We are all vegetarian and the food is really yummy.With the parathas, naans, Kulcha and Biryani. The vegetarian curries are also good - Paneer butter masala, Dal makhani, Egg Masala with the variety of drinks too choose. Its a real feast
4
Visited Tampines branch.Forever crowded despite 24 hours restaurant .Friendly staff mostly but not the one in Blue.A lot of varieties both local and western food.Cleanliness 7/10.Food arrives depends on the time .Set meal not bad despite price increased and fish getting smaller.The only thing good is free warm water but you need to pay for GST!!!Wish that they include the GST like most of the restaurants.Food wise taste ok....Price acceptable
4
This place is buzzing with people each time i come by. Orderd the thai styled fried kway teow as a takeaway. Waiters were friendly, asked me to sit down while they placed my order. The chili padi was cooked with the kway teow. If you like it spicy that was fine but it was truely spicy! Menu selection was extensiv
4
This is a large hawker restaurant, and judging by the big crowd, was a big hit. The service was very quick, which was a plus. The menu is very extensive, with everything from tandoor items and soups to naan and curry. The naan and curry we ordered was very tasty, along with the other local drinks that we ordered, which complemented the food perfectly. The best in the west for sure
5
This is probably the best Indian-Muslim restaurant I have been to. I usually go here after clubbing since its 24hrs and order the usual of naan and buttered chicken. This is the best place to go after a night of drinking or for families during the day. Just like a typical hawker style setting but the food is mesmerizing
4
I visited the Woodlands Grove outlet for the first time. I was awed by the big restaurant offering every conceivable ethnic Malay and Indian dish you can think off! It is always crowded and the "communal" sitting layout makes it a no-frills setting for a meal. Although the restaurant is not airconditioned, it is open and airy. The sitting concept makes one to quickly finish the meal and exit!! I tried the roti prata and the fish curry accompanied by the teh tarik complement. All three items passed the test, with the prata freshly made and crisp, the curry with enough spice and chilli oil to enliven the palate, and the teh tarik aromatic and rich in taste! It has been a very long time since I tasted good prata, curry and tea. Service was quick and it was a value for money meal. I will certainly return you to this spice fix pit stop whenever I crave for spicy food! I only wish the place was airconditioned to make it a more pleasant dining experience!
4
This is a large restaurant and judging by the crowds a popular choice. Service was quick. The menu is extensive, tandoor items, soups, varieties of rice dishes, noodles. The nans were great. The curry portions were small but they were heavy because of the butter /cream added. If you choose a heavy curry like the butter chicken, choose a plain nan or roomali roti to go with it. Our curries were on the sweeter side. Check the descriptions of the items if you like your food spicy. Or perhaps they could give you cut chillies on the sid
4
We frequent this place as its walking distance from Beauty World MRT and open 24 hours. They serve good variety of breakfast items like prata, dosai, Mee rebus, Nasi Lemak etc with lots of drinks choices too. My fave would be Teh Tarik with egg prata which will come crisply hot!It's a good place for lunch, dinner or supper too, must try the butter chicken with garlic naan, chickpea curry as a side dish. This would be just nice for couple, and you can add satay or tandoori mutton or seafood if you need more substance. Can get crowded during meal times and they do pick up services i.e. Call in advance and drive by to pay and pick up the food, all from the convenience of your car.
4
Butter chicken masala was fantastic, as well as the mutton piazza and paneer. Serving is a little on the small side, but no complains at these prices. Naan could have been better. Lots of different cuisine under one roof! Chinese, Muslim and North Indian... The only place where you can order a Chinese steam fish accompanied by Indian naan if you'd like to
4
Order was taken quickly, place was crowded during lunch (and dinner). Never go wrong with the mutton soup n Mee or Bihoon goreng. Too many choices for drinks, varieties of pratas and nans. Ample staff to cater to crowd. 24hr dining. If your are in the Neighbourhood or looking for a midnight snack, good place to try
5
I went a few times to the newly opened Al azhar at Woodlands Grove and I was impressed by the food selection and quality and especially the friendly staff! I went there 2 days ago and this time with my family. My kid accidentally knocked over a cup of iced milo. A staff named Faiz came and quickly cleaned up the whole table without a fuss and also got us a replacement ice milo for us! He has certainly expressed professionalism in his role. I will definitely visit when I'm back from Australia again in December. Keep up the good work
5
Al Azhar serves great food at very reasonable prices. There's a wide choice of Indian both north and south, Chindian, Chinese, Malay, and Western food. I have tried the Malay and Indian food while my family has tried the steak. All we can say that they are all delicious and well worth the money spent. The naan is soft and there are so many varieties to choose from, plain, butter, garlic and some others that I can't recall. The tandoori chicken is good and tasty. My son enjoys the seafood tomyam soup and orders it each time we are there.The environment is the usual coffee shop Indian restaurant ambience, casual and very busy. The waiters are friendly and helpful and service is usually quite fast.
4
Situated near to Beauty world MRT station. They have a huge menu with different styles of meals. I tried Indian foods, those were really tasty and portions were big. I received my ordered meals very quickly and their service were also in a good manner. Prices are reasonable for what you get
4
Note: they only sell prata/drinks until 12 noonThis place has been my home away from home away from home for 4 years now. Ever since I've been coming to Singapore (to visit my now Fiance's family), we've gone here.Now, after so long visiting Singapore, I can safely say they don't have the best prata - not that crispy/flakey compared to other places. But their curries and naans and drinks are excellent!Service is generally swift. They're not the friendliest bunch, but if you're kind, they're kind back.Honestly, I haven't tried a lot of their food as there is so much to choose from, but I'd strongly recommend any of their curries as they've all been great! Love this place~

Busy, cheap and cheerful, open all hours. Have never tried anything but the North Indian food from the massive menu. This we have found to be decent quality and taste, especially the Butter Chicken, Prawn Curry, Aloo Ghobi, Biryanis & Naans. Also the drinks are big and massive selection. The price of dishes and drinks are very reasonable for what you get, which is why the place is always full and remains popular with students. Still you never have to wait too long for a table as it is a big restaurant compared to others on that shop parade. Al Azhar remains our go-to Indian option for dine in and take away after 3 years staying close by
1
Bring your own water. Unless you REALLY like sugar. The prata is so-so (read disappointing), and the plaster prata is more ex than places I've been to. Overall a major kill joy, I should have just stayed at McDonald's opp instead of making the effort on a friend's advice
4
Can't miss it: all the other restaurants around are mostly empty. Even when crowded the service is fast enough.
5
This place serves tasty briyani and prices lower then most other places. They also serve alot of other cuisines and desserts. A great place for causal dining! It's also a popular place for takeaways. My favorite place esp for malay food.
4
great atmosphere good food. catch an insight into how Singapore meshes all cultures together so well. would definitely visit again

I've been transferred to a new site recently, the site office is not yet ready so we are currently stationed at our companies head office here in upper Bukit Timah. Me and my colleague came here for lunch. Most of us crave Malay/indian food so we decided to eat at al-azhar. The place is big (it occupied two units) and well ventilated. You won't have difficulty looking for a place to sit even on rush hour. You can order at the counter, wherein you'll have your food right-away or look at their menu and be serve. I want indian food so i ordered from their menu. I have prata, buttered chicken and pineapple juice (i'm suppose to order teh tahrik but its already hot outside so i opted for a cold drink). The food is good but it took them a long time before serving it. I would have given them a 4star but the slow service is a minus point
4
This is a very popular restaurant for good reason. There is a high menu which is shown on the walls of the restaurant with pictures. No alcohol is served instead a fantastic range of imaginative soft drinks. I had the best butter chicken I've ever had and also a delicious yellow Dahl with chapatt
2
The selection is good and the prices are affordable and what more could you want at such prices? We had to wait for half an hour for our order only to find out that the waiter didn't enter it into the system, although he kept asking us to wait for another 5 min every time. When the food came, it was cold. The management was unsympathetic and just kept asking to identify the waiter. They refused to give us any discount and would probably dock the waiter's pay. Wouldn't be going back. Think the proximity to the MRT station spoiled their attitude.

Met some friends here for breakfast last weekend and was surprised by the range of food on offer, from roti john to pratas, from noodles to rice, and from meat to the huge variety of beverages.The fish curry for the prata was really tasty and a little spicy. The pratas, however, were a little hit-and-miss. The friend who recommended meeting here had said the pratas were the best he had eaten but, in the end, he was the one who sent his back and requested a fresh one made. The egg pratas were fine as they were made immediately after we ordered, but the plain ones were obviously made earlier and reheated. They were doughy and flat.The chicken murtabak and tosai were good, again because they was freshly made. We also liked the teh halia and teh tarik
4
For the first time traveller to Singapore you must visit this place..best time to visit is in the evenings when it's bustling with people from all over the island and tourists. The naans, chapathis,paratas,thosais...briyanis...and more are a good way to experience the many Indian and Malay cuisines....For the uninitiated, the milo dinosaur and milo Godzilla are awesome 
5
So delighted when we first tried here! Food is amazing, the place is always buzzing! Great if you want to take away( seeing as its just down the road from us) not a restaurant the feel is more hawker but tastes better than most indian food we have tried anywhere else in SG- and at that price you can't argue! The menu is extensive but we end up ordering the same thing every week. Chicken tikka masala, jalfrezi or vindiloo, garlic nann, raita and rice. Worth a try!! Don't miss out on this one! Apparantly it's open 24 hours too! :-

Food : Hmm... yummy... SlurpPlace : OkLocated : OkPrice : OkWas recomended to this place by my elder daughter. Food was very good. I'm so in love with my food, MY FOOD! To be frank, everything is an a-ok but ... the sitting place is slightly cramp and I do notice that parking is very limited. For a 24-hours Halal restaurant and this IS the place to be. I guess you can arrange for reservation to avoid waiting for the makaning people gobble down their food. Do take note that the sitting place have two types - No smoking and smoking area. My younger daughter like this place so she could press the 'calling-bell' since the waiter was all so busy. Food was served within minutes!! AND that was fast!!!! And you won't end-up wondering & saying,'where's my food?' Oooh... I miss my Nescafe Cino. I definitely wanna eat at this place again as there's many other food I haven't tried
5
A great variety of food. Efficient service crew. Good, delicious n hot food. Good place to satisfy a midnight crave. Try the Briyani, pratas and mutton soup. My favorite.
5
This is a little hidden gem in Upper Bukker Timmer... You will never want to try anywhere else. Everything on the menu is good, just pick anything and the chances are you will like it. Cheap and quick service.
5
I ate several times at Al Azhar. Anytime of the day, you'll be served roti prata, nasi goreng and tons of other Malay and Indian dishes. There is a wide array of choices to please everyone, same for drinks!
Great place and yummy food!
5
This is a favourite hangout, any time of the day. Food is both local and some international dishes such as steaks. I usually eat more Indian style here, and really enjoy the place.
4
They have almost everything in their menu. The crew are friendly too. My favourite are Al Azhar roti john, nasi briani, naan, satay. Parking is alittle bit far away due to some construction but the food will keep you mumm. Variety of drinks alcohol excluded.
5
Food is great - a mixture of Indian and Malay. Huge choice. It's an old style, basic coffee shop with lots of tables, which is just as well as it is very popular.You look at the menu and then press a buzzer in the table to get (usually) prompt service. No alcohol.Open 24 hours, I believe. We will definitely be going back
5
We come here quite often when in Singapore, great food, great service, excellent smoothies & drinks (especially ice blended Durian ;) and an in-place for the locals make this a great food experience. When youre close to this area and want to eat great halal food, drop by here and order the menu up and down!

Al-Azhar restaurant is situated at Bt Timah. It served verity of food. From western, Thai, Indian and many more. The restaurant is open 24 hours and have ample sit. Price are moderate. So if happen to pass by Bt Timah and feel hungry, do stop for your selection
4
I love this place. It is open for 24hrs, with a wide range of food on their menu, ranging from Indian, Malay, Thai, Western, Chinese-cuisine. It is really a great hang-out place especially if your are looking for cheap and good food in the middle of the night. I never tried much of their food choices as my husband and I would often stick to their fried noodles (Mee Bandung and Mee Gorgeng Thai), Prata (Naan, Murtabak) and Roti-John. All are yummy with generous serving of ingredients. Anyway, please keep in mind that their drinks like milo and horlicks are super sweet. So please ask for less sugar if you dislike super sweet drinks. I am happy that they serve horlick cause not many coffee shops in singapore do :) This place will always be one of my favourite choice for supper :
4
Casual 24 hour dining. Reasonable price, quick & most importantly good service. Wide variety of food & drinks. Western grills, Thai, Malay, Chinese, North & South Asian cuisine all Malaysian style. Not forgetting the dessert. My favourite - Toffee milkshake and a Nasi Goreng USA (white pepper fried rice, sweet and mildly spiced strips of beef topped with a sunny side up) Parking nearby & 24hrs. Avoid Friday & Saturday nights as it'll be crowded with students from nearby schools
