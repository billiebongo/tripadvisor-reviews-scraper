Ideal location and staff were very friendly! Aussie couple looking for good coffee, we found this on our walk and it was amazing. One of the best in Singapore for breakfast

The Cafè is nice and you can see them preparing the food.
The food quality was average but it was ok overall.
Convenient location in Chinatown not difficult to find and good pricing.

I’ve been here a couple of times and love it ! Ambiance is great, friendly staff, tasty food ! I recommend the smashed avocado on toast & that salted caramel cookie. Great experience everytime I go there. Thank you!

I can absolutely recommend this place! Its quite hidden. I walked by two times till ive seen their punch logo.
Coffee and food are healthy, taste awesome and are at reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and very helpful.

I ordered a soy mocha here and oh was it yummy!

They close at 6pm every day and I wished they would stay open for longer. Food here is average but ambience makes up for it!

No fuss Cafe!!! Real fresh and delicious food, beautiful presentation, and best service possible! We had poached eggs with avocado and cappuccino - impeccable!!! The place itself is modern minimalism style with a beautiful vertical back garden sitting space and open kitchen. Many thanks to the chef and crew!!

Great breakfast and very popular among locals. Wonderful smoked salmon egg benedicts top with caviar and added a side of avocado, and must have! My Americano was nice. Ran by young folks, and service was very attentive. No rush and a ix of singles, couples and families

This is Melbourne standard. I had already eaten so just had Chai (Prana Chai) and the yummiest cookie. My husband had the poached eggs with avocado on toast and grilled lemon and a coffee to end. He doesn't like to walk but said it was worth it. Lovely interior and great staff. Would.like to try the seafood pasta which they oyndonon weekdays for lunch. It looked amazing!

Another cafe in Singapore with really good coffee. Came back here for a 2nd visit recently for a coffee after lunch. Almost a perfect cappuccino, served at the right temperature, the right strength and with a nice little design in the froth. Very popular on a weekday lunchtime: I'll have to return some time to try the food here.

On the surface, Punch looked like the type of cafe I love going to - Creative hipster style cafe with good quality food, nice deco and funky loungey music. However, it has quickly become apparent after several visits that the staff and owners have bought into their own hype too quickly. First of all, the portion sizes are tiny. You order a $15 sandwich and literally I could eat 2 and still have room. This could be solved if they had a list of healthy desserts to supplement their menu- however there are only 2 Super heavy and fattening dessert choices, a tiramisu or Super heavy chocolate macaroon sandwich. So you have to choose between starving or calorie overdose. The menu is poorly designed and expensive, which is a shame because they actually have some talented cooks and the food is generally delicious. I always end up going elsewhere after to top up my stomach.Finally, the service is not always customer centric. First, the waiters insist on asking a million times if you want a coffee, must be incentivised on up selling on coffee. Thanks but I don’t need a hard sell when I’m trying to have a peaceful lunch. Second, sometimes when they serve dishes, they don’t bring cutlery or serve you a glass of water. It would seem this would be basic to provide sit down customers with this, especially when you charge 15$ per sandwich. Finally, if you eat alone, they will often try to stick you on the crappiest corner of a table instead of giving you a table that sits more than 1 customer. I appreciate their desire to maximise customers but all customer should be made to feel like they are welcome, not like they are shoved out of sight. Or you risk your customers not coming back.Overall I would say Punch could be rated as one of the better cafes in Singapore. The problem is they are not there yet, they need to improve, and most of all not rest on their laurels like they have made it when they have not yet.

This is a modern but hipster sort of coffee place that serves good coffee.
You can see your food being made from the open kitchen.
Worth a stop for breakfast if youre staying nearby.

Coffee is great at this place.
We liked the food as its not heavy and ingredients are fresh.
Go early, especially during the weekend, as the wait can be between 30-45 mins.

The Peanut Butter cookie was to die for!
Very impressed with the food and the decor.
Enjoyed the burger, waffle.
Coffee was excellent as expected..

Had a fab brunch here. Service was wonderful. All the staff were attentive and helpful. Loved the poached eggs, avocado with sourdough toast. Very generous with the avocados! And those Earl Grey pancakes were absolutely delightful. I still think of them

Had brunch at Punch on a lazy Sunday morning. If was my first visit to Punch and was surprised at how popular this place is. The place was packed but we were lucky to get a table by the window. Perhaps good things does happen when we’re together. The menu options seem pretty standard for a cafe: a variety of eggs on toast, pancakes, muesli etc. Ordered the smoked salmon with ikura on toast, eggs and mushroom on toast as well as a muesli to share. While the muesli serving was a little small, we liked the combination of fresh mangoes and shaved coconut with Bircher muesli. The salmon on brioche was pretty good too but I found the sourdough bread which came with the eggs and mushroom pretty dry. What I didn’t enjoy about the cafe was the high noise decibels. Many people were speaking at the top of lungs and I could hardly engage in a proper conversation. And I was at one end of the cafe. There was the option of outdoor seating but it was raining that morning. Overall, we had a nice brunch at Punch. The coffee was strong which is how I like it.

I happened to be around the area and walked by this small cafe along North Canal. The Grilled Cheese Sandwich caught my attention and that was what I ordered but pretty soon, my stomach growled for more as I saw every other table ordered their Tiger Prawn and Scallop Spagetti. The open kitchen concept is beautifully designed and allows all the delicious aroma to circulate around the dining room (which is another factor as to why I decided to declare #cheatday and ordered the Spagetti). I loved the food so much that I brought my Mother with me a few days later for breakfast and she totally agreed on the chic ambiance and tasty food. We ordered the different poached eggs dishes and every bite was just so sinful! Great stuff! You will not regret! I will definitely be back again to try more items on the menu

Couple of friends took me for brunch there and we got by the back door...Well...I didn't expect it! The place is small but the ambience is great and most importantly COFFEE and FOOD are awesome!!! Poached eggs with sourdough bread, sinnful pancakes with caramelized pear and many more accompanied by really good quality coffee! I would visit again for sur

Punch is a low-key modern hipster cafe serving European-style food for breakfast and lunch at 32 North Canal Rd, close to Clarke & Boat Quays. My husband, myself and our two teenage boys stayed 8 nights at the Park Regis, only a 5 min walk from Punch and its sister cafe Ronin. I had looked on TripAdvisor for cafes near our hotel that served European-style breakfasts, e.g. eggs, toast, museli, cappuccinos, etc. Punch and Ronin fit the bill perfectly and we ate 4 breakfasts at Punch, 3 at Ronin, never grew tired of the delicious food and missed them greatly when we moved to a hotel in Chinatown! When looking for Punch, there is no signage out the front, just check the building numbers and look for the glass door with a clenched fist (punch!) decal on it. Whilst the menu is small, the food is excellent in quality, quantity and presentation. We particularly enjoyed the BLT sandwich, Bircher Muesli, Earl Grey Pancakes, poached eggs and Banana porridge. And their cappuccinos are the best - lots of roasted flavour but not bitter. Our boys loved the iced chocolate drinks, they looked really good, perfect when you need to cool down! The staff were very friendly, helpful and efficient- I was sorry to say goodbye to them after our last breakfast! And whilst not a cheap breakfast, we loved eating here, it was worth every cent. You can pay by cash or card

this place is minimalistic cool. it reminded of great cafes in Melbourne. Went there for brunch had the grilled cheese sandwich the tomato soup that comes with was so comforting. The apple juice with ginger &mint has got a good kick to it. food is well presented in a simple chic way
5
You need to know where this place is located to get here because there is no sign or anything special in the front. Once you locate this hidden gem, the food and coffee on offer make it worth your while. The unassuming decor complements the simplicity of the menu. Simple flavours and great menu customisation all add up to a great brunch
5
Special entrance to the cafe as there aren't any name or display except for a big glass door and you can see lots of occupied tables.
Service was great while food and coffee are good.
5
Small but sophisticated bistro/café with minimalistic decor and Japanese ambience. Short menu but with something for everyone from aglio olio to tsukune burger, various sandwiches and wicked salted caramel brownies.

Amazing place to eat breakfast - had a delicious meal and hot chocolate - perfect place for instagram enthusiasts

We stumbled on this nice little gem of a Caffè when we were walking back to the city from China Town. The staff were very friendly and the coffee was very nice. My partner thought the salted caramel cookie was quite nice as well.
5
It's not easy to spot, but well worth it. We enjoyed an uber delicious Avocado toast with a superb Bircher Müsli! Coffee roast was on point and the Breakfast Mule was just terrific - happy to highly recommend the little oasis to anyone. If you are into subtle yet stylish interior design you will like the place even mor

We came here for coffee after previously going to Ronin which is a couple of streets away and enjoying the coffee there. Punch is operated by the same person. The food menu is a little different to Ronin and the coffee is just as good. We watched the barista make a number of coffees and he really knew what he was doing. They use quality beans and don't overheat the milk or burn the coffee. Highly recommend this place for coffee

Let's start with the Service : Polite and Prompt, able to provide recommendations and flexibility in food preparation. Which is a plus ++ Ambience : Nice and Relax, open kitchen. So you can see how your food is prepared. Nice outdoor sitting area when the weather is good. Food/Coffee: A simple menu is a close bet for good food. And so is the case here. Poached eggs = perfect. Crispy beacon / sautéed mushrooms = comfort. Buttery pancakes, mangoes, oats porridge = there's something for everyone. Coffee = is good, right amount of acidity and aroma. Price = $$$. Reasonable.

Rude and sarcastic barista/manager. The service staff are generally nice people but the service is slow. However, the barista/manager is sarcastic and speaks in a passive aggressive manner, leaving a bad aftertaste that the food doesn't. Had bad encounters with the Barista/manager more than once. Will never come back to this cafe again. There are other better cafes in Singapore and in the area

Popped in here for coffee today. It's a stylish and modern looking place with no obvious sign outside to advise the name. Service is friendly and efficient. The coffee is really good. Although I didn't try the breakfast from what I could see the available meals looked pretty good. Worth another visit for sure

If sister establishment Ronin is night, then surely Punch is day. There are two parts, an indoors done up in stylish neutrals and an outdoor courtyard with giant ferns growing out of the wall. Menu is limited but more options than Ronin which is essentially breakfast, coffee and sandwiches. I visited Punch twice within the same week and was more than satisfied with both food & service. The young team here are all smiles & approachability. I've ordered so far, the fruit salad, Reuben sandwich & Earl Grey pancakes & was satisfied with all 3. Coffee was good & on both my visits, I was able to read without distraction as atmosphere was more subdued than Ronin. This may just be my go-to cafe if I'm in the area.
