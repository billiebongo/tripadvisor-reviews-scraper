A quiet place away from the noisy downtown. The fried har chong kai with waffles and eggs is worth trying. Order the truffle mac and cheese if you really like truffle.

Went for lunch on a Friday with friends. Pizza and pasta were tasty. However, the portions for the pasta dishes were a little insufficient.More pasta could have been given. Service was prompt and good. Desserts were tasty too.

Great ambience, background music not too loud and perfect with the cafe theme.
Food is delicious!!!!

This place is a hidden gem! The white decorations will make you feel like home. The staffs also very nice. I just ordered hot chocolate and they came with mini marshmallow. They beverage itself was ok, not too milky nor bitter. Just in the right amount. Will comeback to try other dishes

I personally consider Hyde & Co as one of these new trendy brunch, coffee places frequented by young professionals or those who are permanently working on something on their macs while having their high power, sleek headphones on at all times.They execute pretty well on their creative menu and it does look like they have made a genuine effort to be a bit different. I had the cinnamon apple cookie crumble and ice cream, which I thought was very nicely done. My friend said her chocolate cake was decent too.I enjoyed the experience, it wasn't noisy in there so you can chat properly. At 41, I did feel like a tad too old for this place

Great concept, very simple, friendly staff. They recommendations great food especially the chili crab pasta and finish off with the to die for desserts the chocolate cake. It was very moist, not too sweet and well balance taste of salty and sweetness. Overall, I would like to go there and hang out next time.The best thing is HALAL, to all muslims out there try them out!!!

[APPETIZERS]Pulled Beef Mantou ($8.90 for 3, $13.90 for 5)Nice local twist on the conventional sliders. The beef was juicy (my biggest fear when eating pulled meat is that they are extremely dry), BBQ sauce had a good balance of tangy & sweet, & the slaw added texture to this appetiser. However, one way in which execution could have been slightly better is to have the Mantou less oily. I guess some people won't mind, but I personally don't enjoy seeing oil glistening on the surface of my food.[PIZZAS]Hyde & Co.'s Gourmet Pizzas have crusts that are on the thin side, crispy but not too much like a cracker. If you're indecisive/curious like I am, you can opt for half-&-half pizzas. I'm torn between the 2 we tried:The Bomb ($13.90/$26.90)Don't be fooled like we were-- the heat from the Sambal Chinchalok really packs a punch! The spread is in between the crust & the Prawn Omelette layer-- not visible until you chow down & feel the heat. It's not overwhelming, but you definitely can't miss it. & who knew that Chye Poh 菜脯 (picked radish) goes so well on an omelette pizza?! Thumbs up for this fusion dish that is unique & tasty.The Geisha ($14.90/$27.90)A fusion combination that most would not be surprised at. Erring on the safer side, this Norwegian Smoked Salmon & Mentaiko Mayo combination was pretty dang harmonious. One of my pet peeves with Smoked Salmon is that it is usually crazy salty, but this wasn't like that at all. The Burnt Broccoli (sounds bad to be burnt but it's more like charred lah haha) adds some texture to the pizza but isn't difficult to bite through, so that is also lovely.** Prices are listed in "(half-pizza/full-pizza)" format.[PASTA]Hyde & Co.'s Designer Pasta game is also pretty strong. Pastas done al dente with great flavours.Hyde's Chilli Crab Pasta ($22.90)I've had this before; I liked it then, still like it now.I prefer my seafood in sizeable chunks, but the Blue Swimmer Crab shreds were in good amounts so I ain't complaining. The chilli crab sauce comes in the form of a localized Homemade Spicy Arrabiatta; it had a good kick to it, & I like that it doesn't numb your tongue 'til you can't taste anything else. A great example of how fusion dishes should be like. Would order this again.Firecracker ($22.90)This is for those who want to play the spicy creamy game. Think of a slightly creamy Laksa sauce over al dente Linguine with Toasted Heibi Hiam 蝦米香 (Spicy Dried Shrimps Sambal), topped with a Honey-glazed Tiger Prawn. I might be biased because I am a seafood-lover, but this is a winner in my books- both as a pasta & as a local fusion dish.Hime-Sama ($23.90)The name of this dish means "princess" in Japanese (姫様). The Mentaiko Cream was on the heavy side, I am not sure if I can finish a portion on my own, but I'd be happy to share it with a friend. Bonus points for it not being salty AF which is sadly common for Mentaiko dishes. Norwegian Crayfish chunks were very much welcomed.. With the Mushroom Confit, it was quite the party in my mouth. Woot![DESSERT]Unicorn Dreams ($15.90)Ah, the good ol' unicorn that people are getting jaded with because (other) people keep instagramming them. Honestly, an amalgamation of pastel or neon colours doesn't do it for me. But it's good to know that in the Paddlepop Fondue, the colours aren't from artificial dyes but from butterfly-pea flowers & puréed strawberries. I did not find this outstanding, but worth mentioning here are the slightly-salty Buttered Popcorn, the Summer Berries Ice Cream, & that perfectly Brûléed Banana Hyde's Kaya Toast ($15.90)This was my preferred dessert out of the two I tried. It was not as sweet as I thought it would be, despite the Gula Melaka shavings sprinkled on top of the Homemade Kaya Ganache. The Coconut & Anzac Cookie Ice Cream is also quite a unique flavour. Cash only Air-conditioned seats only Halal-certified (CAA Jun 2017) No GST or service charge✉ Invited tasting (thanks Burpple!

Visited with friends, everybody loved the food. Me and my friend ordered the Speedy Gonzales, but were disappointed to learn there was no beef available at all that day. We opted to substitute it with chicken, and it was delicious! Service was friendly and timely.Would recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious lunch

Went here with a good friend of mine and we were shocked to see the limited amount of food that was offered. Plus, it was quite pricey. However, once we got our food, it was really worth the price. We ordered Truffle Mac and Cheese along with Chili Crab Spaghetti. They actually were quite generous with the crab in the chili crab spaghetti!Would recommend it to those who can spend abit more money

By now, everyone has had just about enough of hipster cafes. How about hipster-isn cafes that actually serve good food? On first impression, Hyde & Co may seem like a run-out-of-the-mill kind of new-wave hipster establishments. But like everything, hipster cafes need to grow up. Hyde & Co feels like a grown-up hipster joint.My workplace is close by, and I love coming over for their lunch menu. They do change the lunch menu entrees every now and then, which makes regular trips less monotonous and predictable. The har cheong kai burrito is highly recommended.Out of lunch, they do the eggs benedict breakfast etc. I also see people ordering their waffles that look amazing. Personally, I don't have a sweet tooth and usually dine there alone. Will definitely be adventurous when I am there next time with company, and try their desserts

We had dessert banana pancake, floral teas (served in very pretty tea set) and truffles fries. As it is my friend's birthday, staff were very helpful to deliver the birthday pancake with birthday song. Friendly and helpful service team.

Another Cool hippie cafe. Love the salted egg pasta and the apple drink. Menu not so extensive but there is quality.

Located in arab street with halal cert for meat. Not a fantastic meal but average taste. Price is ex compared to other cafes. Basic pleasant setting. Not much variety on choices. Good service and pleasant time spent with family. But there are other choices along the road..

It is quite packed on weekends and they do not take reservations, but if you go there early you'll be ok. We went on a Sunday at noon. The dishes offered are quite fancy, honestly it felt like too many items thrown in for each dish. It would be better if it was simpler. The truffle eggs and salmon came with a lot of mushrooms, which was unexpected and not mentioned on the menu. The French toast was ok but again, nothing out of the ordinary. They were out of juice on the day we went. Each dish for our table came out at different times, so they need to work on their kitchen's organization.Overall it's ok for a different type of brunch, but again, if they offer less fancy dishes but which still have an original touch, and manage to get the all the dishes out on time, it will be much better

This cafe is halal. We ordered cod fish and chips, beef man tou, mac & cheese & ondeh dessert. Cafe is small, probably 20-30 seats.1) Cod fish and chips- oily & no taste...expensive2) Beef man tou-was good3) Mac & cheese-was good but very filling4) Ondeh dessert-interestingCold brew tea was nice.Would I come again? No, service was below average, food pricey. Don't understand why there was queue

Haha... With a title like that what else can you say. Try the 'Brekkie' DIY. Its fabulous! The Chilli Crab Pasta was just perfect and the Walnut Pancake - Mindblasting. Ambience is cosy. I'd say its a nice place to spend with your loved ones and friends. Two thumbs and a foot up for Hyde & Co. The service is good but can be much better. They have the potential to do awesomely well. Keep up the good work!

We have finally tried Hyde & Co. after several failed attempts going there. This dainty cafe is a hidden gem in kampong glam. The ambience of the entire cafe has a very picturesque feel. They offer an array of fusion cuisine which makes it more interesting. We tried several dishes that they have, but unfortunately, taste wise.. its just so so. Its far from what we have expected since we've been hearing a lot of good feedbacks about this cafe. Prices are reflective of a typical upscale cafe. You could spend about $30 ++ per pax provided that you have 1 main dish and a unique and refreshing hyde &co drink.

Have been wanting to visit for awhile now. Recently found myself in the area more often and since I had the time today I thought why not.With seating for about 30 pax this quaint little cafe can get quite busy. Thankful that I went after the lunch crowd has ceased. But still people were streaming in throughout my visit.The ambience has a chill vibe with jazz music piping over the speakers. The decor is naturalistic with whites and taupe as their main colours. What I like about the menu is the fun and apt naming of the dishes and drinks.I had the Speedy Gonzales (main) and Into the Woods (artisanal tea cold brew). Loved the taste and concoction. So no complains there.Thanks Hyde & Co for the feel good lunch that will be fueling the rest of my afternoon.

Friends and I wanted to try new hip cafe's and chanced upon this one near Arab St. We ordered the set meal, food didnt take too long to come. Staff friendliness was average,nothing special. I had the roast chicken, but felt I was eating a hyped up fancied chicken chop from a kopitiam western stall. I didn't taste any spices used in the kitchen neither did the mash patato impress me. After the disappointing meal, we ordered the ondeh French toast. Ridiculously sweet, but all in all a very new experience in terms of taste and presentation. I've stop believing that little cafe's can produce good food so I'm likely to lower my hopes in the future. The deserts however are still pretty decent.

I'd read quite a bit about the hype surrounding this hip cafe and decided to bring my family there for brunch on 17 April. We had called earlier to make a reservation but their staff informed us that they do not take reservations over the weekend, which is normal for a busy cafe. So we decided to do a walk-in.Upon arrival, I noticed a queue and went ahead to let the staff in the cafe know that we needed a table for 4 pax. His reply was simply, "We have no tables right now, you just have to wait outside". Because there were already people waiting outside, I asked him if there was a waitlist that i could fill out and leave my number so that they can contact me once a table is available. I was surprised that there wasn't a waitlist system given the number of people in line. When I asked him to find out how they would know which group of people waiting outside came first, he replied, "You just have to wait outside" and did not offer to help in any way.I was very displeased by this staff's attitude towards a customer who did not take any initiative to address my concerns. The tone in his he addressed me was also rather condescending, and made me feel like he was too busy to help me and the others who were waiting outside. I've been to restaurants that are that busy, or even busier than Hyde & Co, who have a proper system in place to make their customers feel that their presence and patronage is important to them. I cannot say the same about this cafe, and hope that they either put some kind of waitlist system in place, or at least train their staff to be courteous and teach them ways to solve problems when faced with such situations
