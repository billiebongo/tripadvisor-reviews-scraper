First time at MOF. Surprised that place was not crowded. Sitter quickly but service a bit slow. Some ingredients on normal set meals no longer available. Serving of food also slower but service was attentive. Food was up to standard. Prices reasonable.

We were walking around CentrePoint mall looking for somewhere to eat dinner and saw this restaurant. The title on the door says it serves both Japanese food and western food but then we were told they inky have Japanese food. We were dissaooointed at first. But then when we saw the menu and ordered it was all excellent. This is now my favourite Japanese restaurant. We ordered many different foods as they had a 1 for 1 meal deal and everything we ordered was excellent. Also very good childrenâ€™s meal. The drinks were excellent too. Loved my teriyaki salmon belly with rice and salad...... hilghly recommend this restaurant.......I would love to go again. Excellent service. High chair available,e for my kids. Nice comfortable seating
