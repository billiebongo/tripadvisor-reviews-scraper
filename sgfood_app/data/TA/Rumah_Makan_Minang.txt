We came here with a group of friends and only paid S$60! So very reasonable and god busy atmosphere. The food was really good, especially the egg tofu dish, potato cakes and the beef rendang was amazing!

A family restaurant serve minangkabau dishes over 50 types of variety to chose from. Dishes like the sotong Masak Hitam is a must try blank ink calamari. One of the famous must try dishes is their beef rendang I would say it’s authentic
4
The food in this restaurant is great - beef rendang is to die for. If you are visiting Kampong Glam then this is the place for Minankabau (Padang) food from West Sumatra.
4
Friendly service, food not too spicy for tourists. Good curry taste and close to the mosque and arab street and haji lane too.
3
service, efficiency and the manners of their staff can be upgraded. For a restaurant with such good food, it is a shame that the service package is an embarrassment. A tad expensive too.
4
Nice location and food choice for a leisurely Sunday breakfast.
The local servings of Lontong, Mee Rebus , Mee Siam and Nasi Padang are superb.
It's always a nice feeling to be at Arab Street/Kampong Glam. Not too crowded and and nice shophouses to visit.

One of the best Minang dishes in the town. Giving authentic Minang taste for the people. the Rendang is so delicious.

Go earlier like 11am because this place gets crowded with long queues to order. But if you do have to queue, the wait is worth it, trust me I never queue for food.The restaurant sits right across from the Malay Heritage Centre. It is two storeys with sitting on the ground level (roadside) and the second floor, up a flight of stairs situated on the side of the restaurant.Most of what the restaurant has to offer is displayed at the serving area where orders are taken. You get to see what you want and order on the spot then pay at the end of the line. Cash only, no NETS no credit cards. Drinks are also ordered at the cashier. However please note that desserts are placed right at the beginning of the queue so decide on your desserts and pick them up and carry them along as you order your lunch. Try the chicken curry, it is very unlike the typical curries because this one tastes like it's been cooked in chicken stock (soup); the sauce is not too thick and spicy (as in full of curry powder), so it's like a curry broth, simply wonderful. Also must try is the beef rendang, tender, flavourful but a little spicy. Excellent. My favourite, which I've not seen anywhere else is the Beancurd fried with Salted Fish and Petai Beans (non spicy). Another dish I dream off is the Beef Lung, crispy, tasty and optionally spicy when eaten with sambal. Other dishes worth mentioning are Tauhu Telor (non spicy), Ikan Bakar, BBQ Chicken in Green Curry (non spicy), Jackfruit Curry, Tapioca (Cassava) Leaves.As for desserts, you must try the Lopeh and Chendol, they are excellent.Prices are reasonable.Seats on the second storey are comfortable although the staircase incline is pretty steep. The toilet is also on the second storey, usually very clean

This is the place to go for authentic delicious Malay food. Affordable. Choice. Satisfaction. This place is my weekend treat. I have been here for many years with both mom & dad. Dad passed on 4 years ago. So it's a nostalgic return every time. But Rumah Makan Minang never fails to serve satisfying food. Alhamdulillah

Situated in the inner corner in between Kandahar st. Good selection of dishes and fast service. All the dishes are authentic and taste different. Ikan/Fish bakar - 5 starGreen chili chicken - 5 starsRendang-4starsFried lungs - 4 stars Overall very satisfied and good place to visit at Arab St.

We visited this restaurant as we passed by he area. It serves variety of Minang and Malay food, beef rendang, dendeng balado, ikan balado, tahuntelor and many other. The taste was good and the price was fair. Very good value.
4
Not a Cuisine I'm familiar with but we asked for the server's recommendations and had that! It was very filling and tasty and super good value. Would recommend!
5
The best Beef rendang, it was so rich and delightful. i love their Balado, especially with the eggplant. the Tahu telor is great too but the portion is quite big for me ;p
5
We came here for beef rendang but ended up adding more and more to our shared plate (deep-fried fish with tofu, kangkong belacan, curry over rice). The line to the counter was getting long, but things moved swiftly – definitely well worth the wait for lunch.Each dish was so flavorful! One tip: I ordered soda – which I rarely ever do but thought it was a good choice on such a hot day. Nope – it left a “dead,” metallic taste in my mouth that killed the flavors of the food, so the acidity of soda and these spices don’t go well together. Once I switched to iced coffee or even water, the delicious and complex flavors resumed. I highly recommend this place
5
I love this place. Good food and good value. This time me and my wife went for several small plates to try different dishes. The must try is the beef rendang. I have been a couple of times to this restaurant and it has always been good. It is a place I must visit each time I am in Singapore
5
The food here is 10/10! One should definitely try their belado dishes (eg. dendeng belado, ikan belado) and asam pedas, its a must-have! Total for 5 people is $65 so its about $12+ per person with loads of food served. Prices may vary depending on the type of dishes you choose but definitely give it a go!

I came here in search of a highly rated beef rending and wasn't disappointed at all. The was a queue to be served - no bad thing - but it moved quickly and we were sat down outside eating their delicious food in no time. Rendang with rice and a can of pepsi $6 Singapore, best value ever
5
Visited this restaurant last week.Many types of Malay food to choose from. The Tahu Telur [fried bean curd + eggs] is tasty. Servers and staff are polite and helpful. The restaurant is clean with 2 floors of dining area. I arrived at about 10 am on a Sunday and the place was not too crowded
4
The beef rendang is my go-to dish whenever I'm in Singapore. The fish dishes are excellent too. A great eatery in a fabulous location, with a wide range of dishes, although don't leave it too late in the day, otherwise your choices will be limited. Service has always been friendly and accommodating. Well worth a trip to Kampung Glam

This is a street eatery - you can get takeaway wrapped in paper, or eat at the tables there. The food looked fresh and delicious, so we settled for a beef rendang and a spicy chicken with coconut curry sauce. With a small bowl of rice, the price was just over $11. Serves were very small- a hungry adult might choose 2 dishes each - but for a quick lunch we had sufficient between us. Tables were crowded so we were taken upstairs into a large air conditioned room. The food was delicious! Whenever we return, we will definitely eat there again
5
Cheap and great food. Beef rendang to die for as is the fish dishes and other food. A decent lunch for under $10. Can either eat outside "on the street" or upstairs in the air conditioned room.
4
Good authentic Minang/Malay food but very pricey. Avoid lunchtime when there is long queue but not too late or the dishes will be finished.
5
My all time favourite nasi Padang place for my cravings. Never fails to fix my occasional craving for sambal goreng, ayam masak merah and sambal beladoh. If there is one place To try to nasi Padang, Minang is a must try!!! Satisfaction guaranteed!
4
A lovely meal for four ladies ...we had delicious rendang, lodeh, bergedil, asam fish, sambal goreng and botok botok, top up with sambal belachan.
Reasonably priced and service was quick.
3
We were a group of 8 people and we sat upstairs. Ordered about 12 dishes to share. We had chicken, beef, sotong and veggies. Rice was not hot when served. Some of the dishes were salty. Rendang was good.
4
Wide selection of authentic food recommended to us by locals. Have a bit from each to find out more about all the wonderful tastes and spices! Desserts were not my cup of tea, but that is probably about different preferences :-)

We came here for a CSR event with about 70 people. Firstly, the toilet was narrow, wet and dirty. There was no tissue provided and it was very difficult for seniors to climb the steep stairs or use the toilet. 1 of the seniors had asked a staff for sambal chilli but the staff glared at her without acknowledging and walked away. When I called again to ask him nicely, he stopped and glared at me and then walked off, the sambal chilli never came.When the food came, it was delicious! However, after eating half a begedil, my colleague noticed something in her food. We found 2 pieces of hair in the food!!!!!! and it was from only one begedill! Attached are the photos.I will personally never come back here again, was So SO SOOOO disappointed in both the service and the food. visited on April 28th, Thursday around 12pm

We have been coming to this corner shop for over 15 years now and the food has been consistently good, even though the decor has changed.On a recent visit this week, we ordered the sambal goreng (French beans and tempe or soya bean cakes fried in a chilli paste), sambal sotong, curry chicken, beef rendang, lady fingers and bergedel or potato cutlets. All were delicious as we remembered. The Rendang especially was rich and redolent with spices, and the meat was soft and fork-tender.At the end of the counter near the cashier, there is a small area festuring curry puffs and various kueh kueh - do try the huge green ball covered with coconut flakes. Once you bite into the centre, you will be hit by a delightful and sweet taste of gooey gula melaka. Do also try their multi-layered cake infused with rose syrup.Round off your meal with homemde lime juice, bandung (rose and milk drink) or a cup of teh halia (ginger tea) which will also help settle,the stomach.For air-conditioned comfort, just head up the stairs to the left of the cashier.There is also a shop a couple of doos down which sells cake rolls filled with flavors such as kaya, durian and mango. Rolls start from $8 and are a good treat for the family for tea

I had a craving for nasi padang and my friend brought me here, after I told him about it. Its located at a corner shophouse, next to Sultan Mosque and faces the old Istana at Kampung Glam. They serve Indonesian style Nasi Padang. I left the ordering to my friend. Here are the highlights of my meal:- Rendang: This was the highlight of the meal. The beef was reddish in color, unlike the usual dark brown color of the rending I’ve had before. It tasted really great with plain rice.- Sambal Goreng: I learnt that different stalls and chefs have got different recipes for this dish and different ingredients are used to make the dish. This one had bean curd, long beans and tempeh. It was spicy!- Ayam Lemak: Chicken pieces cooked in coconut gravy. I kept scooping the orangey gravy over my rice, as it’s really tasty. Its good!- Bergedil: Mash potato patty rolled into balls, coated with flour and deep fried. Its not bad. - Brinjal with sambal: Chunks of brinjal deep fried and laden with sambal chilli. Yum!We had the above with plain rice. We spent $22

If you're looking for a no frills, affordable and tasty Indonesian dinner, look no further than Rumah Minang. Had a few dishes of the rendang, lemak gravy, salted fish and bagedil. Food was delicious and a fraction of what I would pay at upscale Indonesian restaurants in singapore. The restaurant has a great view of the sultan mosque and is clean. Parking can be trouble especially after office hours so check out the car park on Baghdad St for more options.

Indonesian 'fast' served food with authentic padang taste. Suggest to sit in the restaurant's upper airconditioned floor during lunch time. Prepare cash as they do not take credit card for payment.
5
Tasty, delicious nasi padang food.
Be prepared to pay. Lunch time, queue up to 10 minutes.
Friendly staff, not a too big place
3
Service and food was good. Apparently the table to close with another table. They need to reorganised back. Price reasonable.
5
We had a simple breakfast of mee rebus, mee soto, kueh ketas and teh. Noodles were ok but the kueh ketas (a chewy, sweet, fried snack coated with sugar) was divine with my cup of sweet tea (teh). Nothing makes me happier than finding a local spot that feels authentic. And to cap it off, I have the spectacular view of the Sultan mosque in front of me. Bliss.
5
Walk through the serving counter & tell the folk what you want, take a bit of everything ! If you like your food spicy this is the place to eat. Two of us had a huge plate of food with lime juice for $20 Singapore in total. Take your plate upstairs where there is aircon if you don't wish to sit at the footpath tabl

If you are in Singapore, and love local Malay food, you MUST eat here. Although dishes serve here originated from Minang Indonesia, they have been accepted as equivalent to local Malay dishes. This little eatery is at the corner of rows of shop houses opposite the Grand Sultan Mosque. The mosque is a conserved heritage building - many tourist and local elementary students will visit to learn about Singapore history. Which dishes would I recommend? ALL !!!!!!!!Generally the dishes are not very hot and spicy. But you can always ask for hot and spicy codiments (sambal chili padi). If you see that there are no seats on the road level, this eatery has a level one - which is air-con and very comfortable. Don't worry - prices are very reasonable

I like their food. It's suitable with my family taste and it's cheap also compare with other fast food or restaurant. If you like spicy food, there are many option. You can eat in the first and second floor. It open since morning around 8 o'clock (I think).

Loved this whole area â€“felt more real than the endless air conditioned malls. After strolling Arab Street and admiring all the different cloths, cafes, tea and coffee houses, we whittled our lunch choice down to one of two, and glad we chose the Indonesian(?) Minang. Really friendly staff would have helped us choose if we wanted but I really fancied fish curry and some bean sprouts. Expect bones, small ones could be chewed but I guess locals would eat the lot! Only one small fish and initially I was disappointed with the portions but I was full well into the evening. Paid about $8 for this and another veggie dish and two refreshing iced lime drinks. Great friendly atmosphere and a local shop owner on his lunch break talked to us at length. VERY busy after morning prayers

Oh where do I begin? Do I start raving about the fantastic service or about the ridiculously delicious food? Or maybe the VARIETY of dishes? Ive been a major fan of this establishment since I took my first bite at the former outlet in Far East Plaza ( now closed).My girlfriends and I went to the main outlet in Kandahar St and we ordered a feast. One of the best ways to experience Padang cuisine is to go in a group of 3 or more so that you can order more(order Hidang-style) and get to try a larger variety especially if you're a foodie. We had the beef rendang, ayam goreng belado hijau, lemak turi, tahu telor, ikan bumbu bakar, sambal petai ikan bilis, paru goreng and botok botok. Seems a lot but once you hv tht first mouthful of steaming hot rice, everything just clicks and fall into place. Here, discard ur modern cutlery and just eat with ur hands. Its a complete sensory experience, you touch your food, you can hear sighs of pleasure from your eating companions, the aroma is mouthwatering and your eyes glaze over when you tk that first bite of rich spuved rendang. Sighs. The botok2(steamed fish with spices) was exquisite but be mindful of the tiny bones. The ayam belado hijau was a tad oily but hey! no complains. The tahu telor is a must have, crispy egg tofu drizzled with a sweet tangy sauce and peanuts. Yummy! The paru (fried cow lung) was tasty not gamey at all. The total bill for 3 came up to $70. Seems pricey but considering the quality, the quantity and overall experience, it was money well spent! Will be back for sure

First time experience for me ate minang cuisine. Its suite with my tastebud which is not very hot at all. I really like sambal kering tempe ad ikan masin with chillies but not hot at all. I do not know the real name. A lot of kuih-muih to try. You can choose what you want to eat. From karipap to kuih lopes, goreng pisang, seri muka, kuih lapis and etc.
