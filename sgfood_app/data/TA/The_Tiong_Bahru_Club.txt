The food completely outweighed the "basic" atmosphere, small chairs, imperfect service, etc. If you are looking for white tablecloths & upmarket ambience, don't go here. But if you want great food in a very...er, casual setting -- we enjoyed it immensely.

Chai does not taste like this
When asked the guy - he says 'obviously cause its from machine'
But great marketing and decor...

Great for a meetup with friends or a casual night out with my lovely. Great location, cold beer, and delicioys food. I love the platter - salmon, chicken, prawn, and kafta.

I made a dinner reservation for 14th February and was not informed of the Western and Asian kitchen closure by phone or at the counter when we arrived and were only told of this after we were seated. The remaining menu was so limited that the items recommended by past guests were not available. We were disappointed and decided to come back another time to try these. When we informed the counter staff of this, he did not even look up when he replied "okay" to his cashiering screen. Needless to say, we changed our minds- we won't be back

Came for a late lunch and it was fab ! Got a selection as we couldn’t decide what to have. Watched a man make the samosa we ate which were spicy and good. Tandoori chicken great and pilau rice too. Nice mango lassi and chai tea. All in all a lovely lunch and sitting outside was great for people watching!
1
Let's talk about the food first, their menu with with not much of selection to choose from. Order the tandoori chicken with the butter chicken curry and some naans bread, taste was average but they overcharge.Now let's talk about the Bar and staff, when we wanted to order our drinks is the staff too busy or the manager is reluctant to take our order, cause there barely much customer and for them to notice us is so hard. when we start to order some beer from the tap but they say only lager is left, my friend order some scotch but they say no stock, order some vodka they too out of stocks. In the end my friend decided to order some Gin & Tonic which they have. After the the drinks we ask for the bill, I'm shock to see that the Gin they charge under Hendricks which i saw they only have gordons gin which the added in some cucumber and trying to cheat us. what kind of management which teach their staff to cheat we the customer. After i complain about the bill, the manager don't seem too happy and talk to the staff in hindi which i do not understand what the hell they are talking. Well done tiong bahru club, this show that the management do allow the way u all scam our money. That will be the first and the last time ever

Arrived at 7ish for dinner on a Tuesday, where there was a 20% off tapas promotion. The place was far from full and no one bothered about us depite sitting there for a good 5 mins. So when the menu was finally brought to - they left out the Tapas menu so I had to get it on my own. We had the Okra Fries & Truck Stop Fried Chicken along with 2 Gin Tonics. Food was mediocre. Only one ice water was served when asked. Noone in sight to ask for bill. so my companion settled it while on the way to the restroom. To my dismay, we were not given 20% on the Tapas. When i approached the cashier, he replied i forgot and stared at me blankly ?!?! He then finally punch the calculator and pass me $4 from the cash register. Sensing that he is so unfamiliar with the protocol, i asked for the calculator and started punching the numbers. He then panicked and said SORRY MDM, i give u $2 more when i demanded for the manager. Btw manager was off (!!?) that day and i decided to just let it go since he had apologised. It was much later (after i had left the place) and noticed that I had been overcharged for the Gin Tonic as well - which clearly stated it was $10 on the menu. Well. There are alot of eateries around in Tiong Bahru so unless u have lotsa money to be cheated and want to deal with bad customer service and mediocre food at high prices - Please just save yourself the trouble. Oh, and my receipt is attached - im not exaggerating

The youngest one picked the dinner spot and it was The Tiong Bahru Club. It’s a cross between a coffee shop (has aircon) and a hipster cafe (requisite number of oldie ‘rustic’ stuff). Plenty of tourists and expats - must have been the Indian-ish/local food which appeals. We had the fried laksa (yummeh), club sandwich (so so, the tandoor chicken was a tat spicy), Nasi lemak (not bad). The older one had a Very Berries milkshakey thing which she didn’t take more than 2 sips of so proceed with caution. Menu looked quite standard overall and there was no real standout must-try dish. Even the server didn’t look that convinced with his suggestions. But the tourist-expat crow kept coming in. Maybe this is a club for ‘insiders’ He
1
Me and my girlfriend we had a lunch in this club and we was totally disappointed about quality of the food cleanliness and the service we received.At first the only person on duty was not friendly at all from the moment we approached him, the club was serving water from the machine but we didn't want as after asked, the service man told us that he is not sure the water has been filtered, so we choose water from the bottle but the club was without bottle of water ( out of stock was the excuse this is crazy for a restaurant to be without bottle of water in stock at 12:30 pm ) Menu availability and choices was decent So we decided to have one of suggested set menu with curry rice chicken and yogurt sauce, taste was nothing special and when we asked for extra yogurt sauce the service man refuse to give us more and he told us that if we want more sauce we have to buy an extra portion.Well after his answer I felt shame for him and for his lack of management skills , I understood why this place was empty and I understood the reason of the bad quality of the food and lack of water in stock.For sure I will not come back here even for a drink
1
It’s a cute looking bar, a little empty - let that remind us of the adage, never visit an empty restaurant. Same for bars!Drinks are always expensive in Singapore, but usually the service is better and the mark up isn’t quite as dishonest as this place. We ordered some papadams and raita. 2 papadams out of a box, and a bucket of yoghurt. Bloody terrible and expensive. I would not recommend this place. It’s more expensive than dinner for 2 glasses of wine and boxed crap.
3
Thumbs up for decor and nice music. Great place to chill for a drink. Specialized in Indian cuisine although other local fare are offered. Mediocre food though.
4
We enjoyed our dinner here trying some of the local food and picking up some of the atmosphere in this busy neighbourhood of Singapore. Good service. Delicious food. Cold beer. What else could you want?
2
We ordered Palak Lamb.On the menu it saidPalak Paneer $16 something, below itPalak Lamb +$4 and some change. You would think the menu suggested that you can order Palak Paneer or Palak Paneer you can add lamb to it. But it turned out they were two separate food items. Also we ordered one of the salads on the menu. The description of the salad: chopped onion, tomato, cucumber, green chili mixed with lime and spices. What came out was shredded carrot and cabbage, mix with a little onion and tomato, and no cucumber. When we tried to tell them about both foods that came out are not like the menu description, (the guy who work behind the bar) came to tell us that the salad we ordered is what they have served on the table. When we said but there's not even cucumber in it, and on the menu no mention of carrot and cabbage. He seemed to be annoyed and said "Well, the menu said mix vegetable!" And pointed to me on the menu. When I said that's not what the menu said, he said annoyingly, "do you want me to bring the cucumber then?"Instead of apologizing for their wrong/misleading menu description, he was blaming us not understanding the menu!They need to learn more about customer service.
4
A very cool place right in the heart of Tiong Bahru. They have great local dishes like Nasi Lemak and interesting and refreshing fruit drinks. The staff here is very friendly but could use some additional training. It's a nice place for lunch or a drink in the evening. Please note that the brunch menu listed on Chope is only available on Sundays.
4
The menu is diverse, from North Indian cuisine to local favourites with beer and wine. We had the nasi lemak, seafood fried noodles and kids' fish and chips. All items were very good but the seafood noodles had lots of sliced fish cakes in it. I wish they used real fish. The servers are inexperienced judging by how they were milling around and also not providing us with the right cutlery etc. We would return to try other items in the future
3
I came here for a drink and was surprised to see it has a menu of simple local food. The place seemed quite popular with patrons coming in for dinner. I had its beer on tap and it was quite good. A nice place to chat and chill and people watch
3
This was probably a North Indian F&B outlet. I was there to try out their food. Started off with the Lager at SGD14 for a standard beer mug. Then came the platter for 2-3 person max as stated in the menu. The platter consisted of 2 cut fish pieces, 2 grilled prawns, 2 half length of kebab meat and 2 cut chicken breast. The fish was if they were piece together would be about 10cm by 6cm of about 2cm thick. The chicken cut done in the tandoori way was about the same as the fish cut with thickness about 4cm.The second order for the beer took about 15minutes to arrive or may longer. Then the fish curry was served. The curry gravy was on the salty side, kills the aroma of the spices used. This was taken together with the garlic Naan which as oily. The garlic wasn't crispy but tough as cattle hide. The Naan had to be crispy and oil free to take up the curry gravy when it was deep into it but not this instanceAlso tried the salted Lasi, way too salty. The delicate balance between the sourness and saltiness was not there. Totally way off the scale compared with those that I had in Jaipur.Mid-range eating cost would be polite but should be high end and not fine dinning
5
Stopped here for a beer and ended up spending the evening. The beer is German and the Indian food is Northern and full of flavor. Wonderful. Some reviews think the price is a bit high, but when you taste it, it's wow, The spices are perfectly blended. I had a saag paneer with cheese naan. Some Aussies I ended up hanging out with had meat, which also was mouth watering. It's not expensive. It is a wonderful value for your money. Enjoy. I certainly did.

we were desperately looking for some good Indian food in the Tiong Bahru area and came across this club. creatively decorated, nice furniture, interior....ordered veg. Masala Rice and the taste was just like made in India..thumbs up...nice place to relax...saw a few local having beers and trying Indian dishes...rates are slightly higher plus taxes but in your budget.
4
The atmosphere is set in an old coffee shop, with old relics that can start a conversation of the good old days before the mobile phones! The restaurant was well ventilated and not too noisy - wasn't too busy on a Thursday evening. We were two families of 4 adults and 5 teenagers.The adults had Indian food and it was superb, the best mutton curry I have ever had in Singapore! Unfortunately the whole experience was let down by the poor service of food for the children, where the chef, clearly visible through the glass window, was not able to cope with 5 orders - 2x fish and chips, 1x Caesar salad and 1x Burger. There were two kitchens - one for Indian food, which was extremely efficient when watching all the dishes served through the hatch. As for the other kitchen (where our children's orders were made) the chef looked rather 'cannot be bothered' and cooking one dish at a time. It took 40 minutes from when the first meals were served before the Burger finally arrived. The lady behind the counter was very apologetic and courteous, but was left with a small dissatisfaction at a place that we regularly visit.Our lesson learnt - just order Indian food and all will be perfect!
5
Nice ambience. I like how they have brought all the old ancient things that were used in the past and decorate the place to a piece of art in Tiong Bahru
5
The TB Club is a real low-key Indian treasure. Sit down on an outdoor table and relax, while you enjoy delicious and well-priced Indian specialties. Special mention to Curries and the finger-licking good naans
4
Handy neighbourhood place with good indian food. I'm sure you can get more authentic food elsewhere but if you live nearby and want very tasty food in a casual street side setting, it's great. Always fairly busy so that's a good sign.
4
Brought 2 of colleagues to this place. We enjoyed the food and ambience. A nice place to watch life go by. Good and relax place for catching up with friends to enjoy the food and a drink.
3
Located at a nice part of Tiong Bahru, The Tiong Bahru Club was a disappointment. Food was normal yet expensive. Wasn't crowded at all when I went on a Friday evening. However the selection of chai was interesting.
5
I have to tell everyone how good this was, absolutely brilliant, service faultless, soundings interesting, had interesting pictures on the wall and the food, well the food was just lovely. Try your best to go here and sample the spring rolls, the best we have had, so very big.Top place, well recommended
3
We had a great gathering with friends at Tiong Bahru Club!! No frill, casual and relax place to chill with friends. Food taste good, but limited choice of draft beer. They made a mistake in calculating the bill, but after clarifying they are more than happy to correct it
3
This place has the potential to have a really cool vibe, if it wasn't for the fact that at night it's lit like you're dining in a surgical operating theatre. A little mood lighting would make a big difference to the overall ambiance!The Indian food is delicious, but if you're after a nice wine with which to pair this then you'll struggle with the wines on offer here - I'm no wine snob, but they were so rank we ended up nipping down the street to pick up a few bottles elsewhere so we had something to drink.Thankfully the staff were attentive and understanding and did their very best to make the evening fun - even as we kept adding more guests over the course of the evening.The Tandoor chicken and salmon are particularly worth trying
4
Three of us visited Tiong Bahru Club during Chinese New Year weekend for a causal brunch. With reservations, we were given a table inside. We decided to order lunch rather than brunch. No particular reason, other than their excellent Indian food. The shared food was outstanding, in particular the traditional boneless chicken tikka. The service was fine, except that the wait for a coffee was long and upon arrival it was not very hot. Since the food is great and the ambience is fantastic, it's all worth it. We would definitely return. Afterwards, take you time for a very pleasant neighborhood walk.
5
Took my parent to this restaurant while they were visiting me in Singapore .My dad has the fish curry , I had the butter chicken . We are a family of curry lovers and are alway searching for 'the best curry !' These curries were definitely among our top 3 and best in Singapore . Thank you for a heavenly experience !
5
Good local Indian food with great ambience paired with their beers are impeccable. My first to this outlet. But will drop by again due to the peaceful night ambience they got there.
4
It was a quiet and serene evening, staff was very friendly and food served was delectable. Will try other dishes upon next visit.
3
Great place to sit outside in late afternoon sun and watch Tiong Bahru go by with a cold beer. Food is similar to that of the hawker centre opposite (which is good) but at 5 times the price!
4
Great Food, Good Service and Fun times. The food and service in this oddly located restaurant exemplify Singapore. This is a great place to take guests that offers outdoor eating but coolers to keep the restaurant from being uncomfortable.
4
Serves a variety of cuisine, good for tourist to come. Brought my friends from usa to try the food here, they loved it
1
We had the "Club Devil's Curry". I am sorry to say but this was the worst curry ever - clearly just preheated with a few pieces of chicken and the lousiest sauce you can imagine. Food courts and hawkers offer much better meals at fraction of the price
3
The food is expensive and not even good. The raita was sweet and tasted a little off. When we told the waiter and insisted he try it, he was rather smug and said it was perfect. Please. I'm Indian. The samosas, described in the menu as filled with vegetables, were actually filled with potato only in one of them (the other samosa had two peas). On top of that, they were pre-made and re-fried. The ambience is lovely. Other than that, there are far superior places to eat
4
Had food from both the lunch and dinner menu - both tasty but the curries from the Indian dinner menu were amazing. We had the paneer makhani, baigan ka bartha (aubergine curry) and the Indian railway lamb curry along with garlic Naan and masala pulao - all delicious. Service was not an issue. Would recommend.
2
For a cafe that was only one-quarter full at the time of my visit, I'm struggling to find an excuse for the poor service. Perhaps they are too busy working on their 'Old Singapore' image to actually serve anyone? Or perhaps I am invisible?I popped in here to ask if they did breakfast. The manageress waved me towards a menu hidden behind a bar. I found it, sat down, was mildly shocked by the exhorbitant prices, and waited patiently for someone to come and take my order. After about ten minutes, the manageress noticed my forlorn and perplexed gaze, called a waitress, and sent her in my direction. First, the waitress decided to stop and clear a table before coming over - and serving the couple next to me, who had only just sat down.Nobody likes to be made to feel invisible. I went elsewhere
4
This Restaurant was just a short walk [100 metres] from our Hotel [the Nostalgia] so as we needed a late meal and this place was still serving we took a punt. Cleand and tidy open fronted restaurant on the corner opposite the Food Hall. Mixture of locals and quite a few ex-pats, offers indian or chinese style food. If you go for the Samosa's then be prepared for a HOT experience, we needed the big beers to cool down. Value for money, good selection, drinks prices avearge for Singapore with a big beer at 12 S$.Kitchen closes at 10 it seems, so dont go too late
2
Quirky restaurant and bar in the midst of a bohemian neighborhood. Interesting menu with more than a passing homage to the British Raj, interesting beers, but very pricey.
4
Local cuisine at a premium. The devil's curry was really spicy! The other dishes was nicely done and a treat for the palate
3
In a lovely area of Tiong Bahru close to the markets you will find this old colonial style restaurant and bar serving Indian food. I had a few appetisers which were ok but ordered a draft beer and the machine broke. Other draft beers were not available and you just got the feeling they were operating on the edge of existence!! Hope I'm wrong
4
Right across from the Tiong Bahru Food Market. I was immediately attracted to the decor of this old-school Singaporean club. I was salivating at the menu as well. The samosas I had were not all I'd hoped for, and the beer selection was abysmal, but the mango lassi was delish and the atmosphere was quite enough to make it an enjoyable evening. The Chaiholics selection of Chai teas was inspiring
4
We went here because it was handy for the hotel we where staying in, from the outside it looks nothing special but the food is wonderful I recommend the railway curry, the lamb just melted in the mouth the curry sauce is not over powering the accompanying rice was wonderful. Not the cheapest or fanciest restaurant but nice staff and something different from big chain restaurants
1
Had brunch with the family. The waiter was eager to service but rather dishonest. First, when we queried whether the kids meal comes with a drink as indicated on the menu, he replied "No" without hesitation. It's only after we pointed out that on the menu that he agreed to "check" and did not apologize for his error at all. Next, when my wife queried whether her drink served was a chai latte as it tasted like coffee, he replied that it was chai latte! Again, lying without skipping a beat. The food was also of poor quality, with the worst poached eggs that I have seen.Strongly recommend all to rethink before coming, unless they can fix all these issues
5
Been several times after stumbling upon this place on Tripadvisor. Definitely one of the best Indians I've been too in a long time. The butter chicken and king prawn tikkas were very good. A must try for curry lovers, albeit at a slightly greater price, but worth it ..
5
When looking at the name, you would expect to wander into a colonial club. But this is a very nice local eatery, typically located on the corner of the street.I read the earlier reviews and just do not make the same mistake: this is not hawker food. But you can have a very traditional local dishes and these come with a premium as you get so much more. For example the Nasi Lemak is not the 7 dollar plate with just rice and some condiments, egg and some curry. This is the Club 88 Nasi Lemak which comes at 16 dollars. But you have a full plate!! And you get treated in a very nice ambiance. Service is excellent. The chef being Indian there is a big choice of Indian samplings... Just go for it!
3
The food here is tasty and well prepared, though portions are large â€“ best to take the bento option for a smaller appetite, if it's available. The chai latte is authentic and a definite must-try. Skip the porkitos, though. The downside is that everything is rather overpriced for what is really just a glorified coffeeshop. I might return just for the chai and nothing else
5
We ate here two time during our stay in Tiong Bahru. On the first occasion we had dinner and late night drinks, and the second we had brunch. The food and service were above average, and the owner even took time to speak with us during our meal. The food is a nice mix of classic Indian and Singapore style Malaysian. We also enjoyed the open air feel of this restaurant, the outer tables are basically right on the street. We'll definitely go back on our next trip to Singapore
4
Excellent place for a grilled tandoori and some wine. It's in the quaint Tiong Bahru Estate and in the evenings, it's a great place to hang out with friends or to drop in for a bite to eat. The tandoori grilled children was simply delicious.
5
The tandoori meat platter was great, and the staff were extremely friendly. Lovely place to spend an evening.
2
Portion was small, taste just normal...
Terrible coffee....
Definitely overpriced.
Will not go there again I think.
5
Great location and ambiance, attentive service, delicious food and affordable alcohol! Exactally what we wanted.
5
Wandered into this little spot and was introduced to some great pints and interesting tapas. Absolutely fabulous service by Selena.
3
~ Love those vintage chairs, tables and decorative feature that brought back childhood memory.~ Weak flavour Mutton curry that needs more spices and Garlic Naan lack of flavour.~ Nice Sambal for Nasi Lemak, but the fried chicken were dry and disappointing.~ Dont mind to relaxing there over a cup of coffee and some bites
2
Liked the old world charm and ambience when we saw this place on our last visit to Tiong Bahru. Decided to try it out. Had to stand by the checkout till to place our order for 10 mins before the old gentleman at the counter decided to take my order. Wasn't sure about what was available so he referred me to another lady. They were out of samosas, croissants ans scones. Couldn't see anything else we wanted to try so walked out disappointed...may visit next during breakfast to try the parathas...maybe..
4
We've been visiting about once a month whenever we crave for Indian food. The lamb biryani, chicken curry, tandoori platter are some dishes we frequently order. Food ain't cheap, for sure. But it's a great place to chill, have a beer and watch the world go by. Am surprised by the many bad service reviews. We've always received good service, especially by an Indian lady whom we think is the boss
4
Having walked past this place a few times on previous visits Tiong Bahru we thought it was time we should try it out and so glad we did.The staff were attentive and very helpful particularly when helping us choose what to eat and were able to cater for my food allergies. We had food offf the Indian menu and the quality and quantity of the food was excellent and more than sufficient. The place itself has a relaxed chilled out atmosphere and a great place to sit and watch the world go by.We will definitely be returning .
4
Went to Tiong Bahru to sense the quaint ambience of laid back Singapore and was fascinated by the locality, it's quiet and cleanliness far from the hurry burry of Orchard Road or 'upmarket' Dempsey Hill. Looking for a place to grab a quick lunch, we stumbled across this simple cafe and came out quite impressed by the Indian fare on offer. The stuffed Kulchas & Naans were authentic as were the Paneer Pasanda & Dal. High point though was the Okhra Fries which were delicious! Together with Lemon Grass Chai & Strawberry Lassi, it was a wholesome meal served with attentive care and a smile. We came out impressed
5
Love this place. Relaxed. Great food. Service very good. Their food is really fresh. The samosa's and tikka are very good. Not the cheapest but not OTT. Value for money.
3
It is a very nice location, located in the perfect place in the center of Tiong Bahru, just in front of the market. Food is good (Indian), very nice design and furnishing, service is average. Everything is very "nice" actually, but nothing great nor special. That is why 3/5 here ... nothing great out of this place beside the location really. It is the right place to have a drink and relax in Tiong Bahru and I love the atmosphere. They serve good Indian food and beverages (+ weekend brunch). Only beers and wine, not any other alcohol or cocktails
3
The food here is okay but nothing special. This place is around the corner from the hotel Nostalgia, where I was staying so I decided to give it a try. I sat outside for dinner and I have to say that the ambiance of the restaurant is very pleasant but the outside chairs were very uncomfortable. I think that I would give this place a miss and head across the street to the Tiong Baru food center, which has much better and much cheaper fare
5
We live in the neighborhood and regularly stop by for a beer. A great atmosphere with friendly service. Good beer selection (although sometimes beer on tap runs out -- but I understand supply issue is with the vendor). We usually go home for dinner, but we do eat here on occasion and tandoori dishes are tasty. Good place to hang out just with my husband, or friends. Definitely recommend
4
Located in Chinatowns fancy area with expensive shops and cafes. The Cafe is great located to observe street life, locals and tourist. The interior is chosen wisely and creates a Cuba- like athmothphere. A great place to have s beak during sight seeing. The food we had was average, coconut chicken soup was nice but didn't had any coconut taste. The chest bread ("naan") was delicious cheesy. They just ad 7% of menu prices to the bill which feels a little cheap compared to other fares on Singapur. To find the toilets, you have to get through the kitchen and can have s sneak at point of origin of you dish
4
Stumbled across this place after grocery shopping nearby and decided to stop for a light tapas dinner. Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food! We had chicken satay (tender chicken skewers served on a mini charcoal grill with nice white embers), grilled stuff cuttlefish (absolutely tasty), fried chicken (beautifully fried with moist breasts pieces coated with some tamarind ginger seasoning) and cheese naan (super light and fluffy). For the very high standards we have, this place more than exceeded all expectations! Portions were large, so we struggled to finish the items between us 2. I noted several past reviews on poor service but did not experience anything like that. If anything, they were trying quite hard. Definitely coming back
2
We were staying at Nostalgia Hotel and passed this place a few times and it seemed quite popular so we thought we'd try it out even though it was quite expensive. We had a very long wait for our food, but they seemed very busy so we tried to let them off. My partner's food came first and she started digging in as I was still sat waiting and waiting. Eventually my food came by which time my partner had almost finished hers and after five minutes of eating mine I realised our Garlic Naan and our cheese naan hadn't arrived. I called the lady, who looked to be the owner, over, told her what we had ordered naan-wise and she went and shouted at a serving boy who arrived a few minutes later with a cheese naan. My partner had finished her curry by this point so it was hardly worth her having her naan, and after another 10 minutes there was still no sign of her garlic naan arriving so we complained again to the lady and told her not to bother with it as it was too late now so could she take it off the bill. Our bill arrived and we had been charged for 2 cheese naans. So we complained again, this time to a young female waitress who immediately took the 2nd cheese naan off our bill (we had thought my cheese naan was quite big but it was all in one pot and in lots of slices so we wonder if the boy had given us 2 cheese naans - but they never told us it was 2 and sometimes naans are huge). We paid our bill and the young girl gave us back our change. We were that fed up with our service that it didn't give us too much of a surprise to find that our change was also wrong - unfortunately for the restaurant it was in our favour. We are very honest people and always in that situation we would tell the waitress and make it right, however we were that fed up and annoyed with a nice, but expensive, meal that was ruined by terrible service that we decided on this occasion it was their loss. If you are in the area you would get more satisfaction from visiting the food centre across the road - its much less european, and you get to sit among the locals and eat a good meal for a fraction of the price
5
My wife and I just had a great lunch here. Very friendly and efficient service and 2 very tasty meals (the lamb kebab and railway lamb curry with basmati rice and garlic naan). Great spot right opposite the best wet market in Singapore so lots going on. Definitely recommend this place.
1
Your service is an absolute disgrace! If I had a choice, I'd have given your place a "Very Poor" rating. This happened on last Sunday and I seriously RECOMMEND you guys to BUCK UP or risk more bad reviews on every single social media platform on the internet. But I guess you just don't care because none of the previous bad reviews were properly managed and you have never learnt your lesson. 1. You made us wait for a solid 5 minutes for our chairs at an empty table. 2. You made us wait more than 15 minutes for just 2 PINTS OF BEERS and have the nerve to forget our orders. Yet, you can asked us again for our orders! 3. Not even a word of sorry when I decided to cancel our orders. WELL DONE! You have officially made it to my list of WORST customer service I've encountered in my entire life
4
We're staying in the Nostalgia Hotel and we happened on this restaurant just around the corner. One of the best fish curries I've ever had! Love the feel of the place and the vintage decor. Having left boat quay yesterday unimpressed with an Italian offering, which was overpriced, outrageous, my sense with this meal is that it is worth the dollars. Finished with a gourmet ice cream sandwich and an Indian Railway Chai, Brew of the week, which was great. Strongly recommend a visit. Staff are very friendly which again isn't always a given in Singapore
4
Good food but a bit pricey. Nice place to chill with family & friends. Though there were times that service was not good. Had to wait for food for more than 30 minutes.
4
The staff, the food, the setting- everything about this place was amazing!
The 4 is us decided to have tapas dishes and beers for dinner, it came to about $100 which was great for everything we had. Would certainly recommend.
3
I had the Eggs Benedict while my friend had the Full Monty. Both were below average. But if you are looking at a place to chill without the crowd this may be it.
5
We found the atmosphere delightful - friendly service and charming music set in a funky space. The food was delicious as well. Highly recommend the grilled squid!
4
One of the best burger I have ever had, the beef was incredible, at the same time cruncy and soft. The bread, made with a tipical indian spice, is the top. You have to try it!
Also indian food is good, a wide selection.
2
My wife and I visited this place last Saturday evening. The location is quite nice and the ambiance good enough. We orderded some drinks, all fine. Then we the ordered the food: lamb curry and grilled fish. The lamb tasted chewy, not tender at all, the curry was quite bland. Very disappointing, especially if you reckon that you pay SGD 26 for this dish. After waiting for quite some time my wife got her grilled fish, which was undercooked. So, she asked the staff to grill it a bit longer. After about 20 minutes (in the meantime I had finished my meal) they came back with the fish, now it was clearly overcooked?! So, this place is good for having some drinks, but please do not order any food. There are lot of excellent foodoptions around

Stopped here for a meal as we were staying at a nearby hotel. I ordered the Lamb Curry, which appeared in less than 5 mins and was only just hot enough. Maybe it was just that we had been to Little India and had a chicken tikka masala the day before - which we waited 20 mins for, but was made with amazing fresh spices and hot flavours and cost half the price

Sadly we were too full to try their extensive, interesting and colonial/Indian menu but they did have a fun section on teas, chai and coffee. Like most places in Singapore, beer is pricey but the staff were welcoming and it was great for gathering and catching up al fresco style

I ate here a few nights ago on my own sitting at the bar. Really enjoyed the food and the owner Jerry is a friendly guy who comes by and chats with all of his guests. Nice setting, feels like a Bombay cafe from the 50s and good food.

Nostalgic and yet unpretentious, this little corner bar is reminiscent of those classic days of beer and curry. We stumbled upon this place and only wanted a few beers but ended up eating too much!The menu has both local Asian and Indian food and a nice small range of beers and an even smaller choices of wines. For those wanting wines, it's best to go to a wine bar. If not, TBC will satisfy, particularly the awesome curry and tandoori.Although an open air bar, there are air-conditioners on the inside, making it rather comfortable. The atmosphere is decidedly back to the 60's and beyond and Bobby is the easy going manager there.There is also a chiller filled with natural ice cream and interesting flavours too. What a find! Itching to go back again

The hosts were friendly - the food excellent - felt like one of the locals - ate there on several occasions.

Wish we saw the review before walking in. Went with a few friends and were drawn in by the wonderful ambiance. But the food was okay, the tea was outright bad and the beer was good. Go for drinks to enjoy the ambiance.

Slow service, really bad food and high prices. Don't waste your time and money on this place, singapore has so many great places!

Ceiling fans, old marble-topped tables - it all has a nice retro feel. But the food is extremely average and the service on the night we were there was curiously disconnected from the customers.

Staying at Wangz Hotel and this delicious place is a short walk away. Great staff, German draft beers and AMAZING curry dishes. Indian and Asian cuisine available. There is also a cool tea place inside. Ceiling Fans for outdoor seating are a plus. Eat here you'll be happy

Around the corner from the Hotel Nostalgia, this is a must stop local spot for two particular items - the awesome chili fries, and the truck stop chicken. Highly recommend an order of garlic naan with the truckstop chicken to make a great meal. Great service and very friendly owner!

I've been here a couple of times, and looking at the number of reviews it's got I feel like more people need to know about this place. It has never failed to impress, doing everything so well from Indian to Thai to Malay food. The satays i had here were some of the best I've had in SEA. The setting is great, people are friendly, and there are as many delicious food choices as there are beverage options. I couldn't recommend it enough.Must-try: lentil soup (very spicy), satay, beef rendang, chai

Found the Tiong Bahru area by chance on my way back to the Furama Riverfront Hotel. This place beckoned with cold beer and the absolutely best Dahl Bhat ever. A large serving and quite spicy, just as I like it. Don't be put off as it comes in something that looks like a small fire bucket. Very friendly place and just across the road from the hawker area.

We had the nasi lemak, which, at $16.80, is what you would pay in a hotel coffeehouse. The presentation was beautiful, but the taste only average. The chicken pieces were tiny, the otah too bouncy in texture and the Ikan bilis and nuts lacked "kick". Other items on the menu did not look cheap. This place is nice to look at, and probably good for a few drinks, but skip the food

The restaurant is on a corner, open on two sides and I thought had a really pleasant retro feel. The menu has a selection of Indian, Malay and local dishes. I had a solo lunch: a good Singapore laksa with a beer - what a pity there isn't a local beer on tap. My meal with service came to just under S$30
