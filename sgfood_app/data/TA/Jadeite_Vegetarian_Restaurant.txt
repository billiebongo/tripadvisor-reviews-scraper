Came here to try vegetarian Singaporean food and was please to see the options. The portions were just right and tasty. The location is in the mall on the 3rd floor!

For $9.90, you get a starters, main course and a drink. Local vegetarian fare. The penang kway meow was so yummy. Other main courses are equally appetising. If you are vegetarian, you will love this place.

This relatively small restaurant is tucked away on the 2nd floor of a commercial building and doesn't see much passing traffic. Orders are placed and paid for at the counter; cash only. The meals are brought out in under 10 minutes sometimes less and served hot. Good value for budget meals.

We were looking for another vegetarian place on TripAdvisor but couldn't find, but stumbled across this place on the 3rd floor of a small mall. It looks completely Chinese but when we sat down were given menus in English. Food was delicious and great price compared to what we had been experiencing. Would go agai

My colleague recommended this eatery. Simple decor, right and clean - located on the 3rd floor of Bugis Cube. I had the set lunch $9.90 - choice of main dish (pork chop rice), side dish (vegetarian goose) and drink (luo han guo). No MSG! Food is delicious
