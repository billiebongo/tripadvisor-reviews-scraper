This is the place to go for fuss-free beer and wings.
People are nice, mature crowd that is not pretentious but is there to just hang out and have a beer or two.

This place is extremely crowded, probably because of its cheap drinks and tasty bites. daily alcohol specials are advertised, though the regular prices aint too bad as well. fried rice here is surprisingly good, besides the regular wings. a pool table there as well for friendly players and hustlers

Having a beer in Singapore can be an expensive proposition, especially down-town. Cuscaden Patio addresses that by having good beer at a reasonable price and supplementing it with a good selection of pub style food, also for a reasonable price. Whenever we go, we always get the chicken wings and in my honest opinion, the wings are the best anywhere in Singapore
