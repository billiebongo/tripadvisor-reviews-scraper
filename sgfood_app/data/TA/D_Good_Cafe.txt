Very average. Food looks nice, but tastes not great. The interior supposed to be well designed however it was not comfortable for us. Coffee is just ok
5
The cafe is close to the MRT ,making it a plus! The cafe ambience is really nice. The coffee is good but slightly over priced.The staff were friendly too.

I ordered coffee and cake which were okay and nothing to brag about. But I really like the interior. The customer service was great too.

Disappointed with customer service. Visited Taka branch.I ordered afternoon tea set and asked for a type of tea which was $12. The server said no when the menu clearly stated that you can choose tea that is up to $12. And during payment, cashier said this time we won't charge for extra jam but next time we will. However, I did ask before if the jam is refillable. if not let me know I can pay

Visited this place after church after having a craving for some sweet stuff. Was not disappointed as the interior was charming and cozy. The coffee was great and ordered the famous pancakes and found it to be pretty good with the lemon, cream cheese and maple syrup. Had the pizza too but it's only so-so. The eggs benedict was good. Interestingly the eggs were pretty consistent. And the salad that came with the eggs were refreshing with the balsamic dressing
4
I ordered a Egg Upon Egg on toast and an Iced Chocolate for breakfast. Both were good. The ambience was inviting at 10am on a weekday morning till some students came in making a lot of noise while studying. The counter staff was very friendly and chirpy. The only thing that was lacking was the poor ventilation at the counter area where orders were taken. My hair smelt like a mixture of food smells after just a while
5
Such a cute place and away from the busy crowds. Lots of food options for any mood. I tried the pork cheek and it was so savory and delicious. Also great for tea and coffee. We ended the meal with white chocolate raspberry ice cream- superb

Two things D'Good Cafe does best are coffee and pancakes. There is a wide selection of coffees on the menu and their coffee is of top quality. If you're a coffee fan, just skip all the famous chains and come here. Now about those pancakes. There are a few toppings to chose from, but I prefer a classic one which is served with maple syrup, lemon and some sort of sweet cream cheese. You might need to wait for a while, but it is definitely worth it. They are served warm and crispy. Other than coffee and pancakes, they also have a good selection of tea and smoothies. You can come here for lunch (I tried their pasta, it was very good). There are desserts other than pancakes, but I really think you shouldn't skip those pancakes.The service is extremely warm and friendly and it makes you want to come back again. The location is also very good. It is located in Takashimaya on the Orchard Road. Pancakes are waiting!

Located at Takashimaya, B1... service attitude by the Manager was very unprofessional. Meant to be my Actual Day Birthday celebration but it was all ruined. Good food presentation but with such service attitude, there is no way to consume the food and drinks at ease or comfort level. Waiting time is long and they 'select' customers to sit at their special 'swing' tables tagged with 'reserved' even though there is no reservation made for those two tables. The entire lunch was the worst ever dining experience I have ever encountered. Overall, no customer service , unprofessional manager whom facial expression doesn't welcome diners and words simply insult diners to the max. It's not worth to patronize with such a price tags to the menu.

I visited the orchard outlet today and was pleasantly surprised with the generous serving of minced crab meat. The linguine was also nicely done in aglio olio style and mildly spicy. I also ordered the berry smoothie and enjoyed it too, not too rich or diluted. I also had special order to exclude chives in the pasta and smoothie to be in takeaway cup and was delighted when both were fulfilled. While many people feel this is expected, I donâ€™t take it for granted as many staff will overlook / forget the special order. Kudos to the staff at orchard outlet

Visited for brunch, Eggs Benedict slightly underdone, but side salad excellent, limited range of cold drinks, wide variety of hot drinks, generally fine and I would return
4
Love the coffee from d'good, perfectly selected beans, sourced and roasted to perfection
Delicious Nutty smooth texture with a complete non-acidic taste...
Staff are always so nice and welcoming! Love getting my coffee from this cafe!

Haha we had to queue for a seat here - first time we had to do this for a cuppa and some cakes. Good selection of food here but limited choices for drinks. But overall not too bad.

Located at Takashimaya Basement 1 and nearest train station will be (Orchard - Red Line).D white cold brew coffee is nice. Coffee strength 3/5 and lightly sweeten. As for food, I find it pretty much very normal. All the portions of the food are really quite small and it doesn't really value for money. Even the sides are way too pricey. For 4 little tiny wings, it cost us 8 bucks. Lucky for us that we have got he 25% discount due to national day celebration. Service of the staffs are great and they are really friendly. They do take the initiative to tell you what's for promo.Overall, for 2 main course, 1 side and 2 drinks. The bill came up to be almost 70bucks.

After a disappointing and unsatisfying lunch in Cathay building, my daughter and I began searching for dessert. Another errand brought us to Takashimaya where we happened upon this inconspicuous cafe which was new to us. What caught my eye were the London Tube logos in their decor.A simple inquiry as to which of their delicious-looking cakes contained nuts ended up with our being ushered to a table by a very energetic and bubbly waitress, Jinia. When it became clear that we were only there for dessert and coffee, she regaled us with a lively description of the cafe's offerings, finally convincing us to try their Tiramisu. It came across clearly that Jinia was as genuinely excited about the cafe's fare as she was to ensure we would be satisfied.Tiramisu came as a feast to the eyes! A generous portion of cold rich Tiramisu sitting seductively on a delicious-looking Dutch pancake with chocolate sauce and strategically-placed strawberries - all enticingly served on a little skillet. Don't get me wrong - I used 'little' to describe the skillet, but it was enough to satisfy the two of us after lunch.With a cold latte, which satisfied my daughter (and she's not easy to please when it comes to coffee) and a refreshing hibiscus herbal drink for me, the total bill would have come to just under $30 had my eagle-eyed daughter not spotted the sign giving seniors a 10% discount. (So nice to have our elders appreciated.) All-in the bill was just under $25.With another outlet at Holland Village, you can bet, D'Good Cafe will be on my daughter's "must-visit" list. As for me, well, I'm getting a little old and I live way up in the north. But should I find myself having to get into the city, it'll be a place to find some rest, refreshment and excellent service.Thanks Jinia

Tried the coffee and cakes at the D'Good Cafe at Ngee Ann City for at least 3 times, the quality of the coffee and cakes are well maintained. Service is prompt and attentive. The cakes are big slices and good for sharing. Do try the Maple Sea Salt Cheesecake, Chocolate Hazelnut and Triplet Cheesecake! The coffee are all well decorated with coffee art upon serving and with a small piece of Biscotti. They serve other food items like burgers, fish and chips, pastas and steak. Vegetarian choices are limited to a pasta dish and pancakes. Do not miss if you are at Ngee Ann City shopping, they are situated at B1

Been to both the Takasimaya cafe and the Holland Village cafe. This review is for the Holland Village cafe.. Like this better as the area itself is a bit more relaxed and gives that quiet afternoon feel you get when in Europe..The cafe is on the second and third floor ( the third being the open attic ). Nice relaxed ambience and looks like the owner has spent some time decorating it to give a Europen Garden cafe feel....Food wise had the Fresh Sea prawns aglio olio and Parma Ham/Melon savoury crepe.Both were really good . Recommended.A good place to go if u want a feel of the european charm.....On the downside not much on dessert selection. Just cakes .. Would have loved it if they had Bread and Butter pudding and a few other puddings.As they say the proof is always in the pudding...My rating Good based on what they serve and ambience.

This review applies to the second d'Good Cafe in Takashimaya Shopping Centre, Ngee Ann City, not the first one in Holland Village. My GF and I had brunch with friends, and we ordered an English Breakfast, a D'Lobster Roll, a Portobello Eggs Benedict, and a LING Cod Fish and Chips. Our drinks included Iced Mocha, Cafe Latte, Maple Sea Salt Latte and some juices. We were all impressed by the presentation and the taste of the food. The cafe was decorated with many English elements such as the London tube and the English Garden. Service was good and prompt

Dessert and Coffee I ordered an Iced Cappuccino and Apple Crumble Pancake . The Iced Cappuccino was good , with enough bitterness to it . It was not too creamy too . The Apple Crumble was really good . It was served in piping hot in a hot plate . The fragrant of the Pancake wafted to my nose when it was served . The Pancake remained warm till the end . It was not too sweet for a dessert . I had better Apple Crumble dessert at Jewel Cafe @ Rangoon Road but the Apple Crumble Pancake at d'Good Cafe has it strength . The Pancake here smelled better and and it was served hot. The streusel (Crumble) here lost out to Jewel Cafe . Food I did not order any food this time but I had tried their fried mid joint wings at their Takashimaya branch . The fried mid joint wings were only average to me . I saw on their menu that they serve Pasta and Breakfast . Ambience d'Cafe @ Holland V has a much better ambience than their branch at Takashimaya. There are two white swings at level two, the same level as the ordering counter . There is another air-con area at level three. The alfresco area at level 3 looks cozy . I feel that d'Good Cafe is a very good place to hang out with friends . I went on Vesak Day but the cafe was not crowded . StaffThe staff was friendly and responsive . They have a smile on their faces . Upon hearing my requests not to add sugar , another staff beside the cashier took the effort to verify with me patiently what I did not want . Kudos to him . Thumb up ! Birthday Celebration Through a friend, a birthday person gets to enjoy a free large milkshakes if he/she dines at d'Good Cafe at his/her actual birthday. I saw the large milkshakes in my friend's photo and find the the concept cute and fun .

Decided to give D'Good Cafe another chance and was disappointed again. There is seriously nothing good here except unless it's your birthday and you would like to "drown" yourself with that gigantic drink.Student do get discount so I guess if I am a student and it's my birthday I will probably drop by. But for the rest of ur 364 days you are better off some where else. Sometime being good just do not make the cut

I have been here for brunch and lunch. I have tried their Prawn Aglio Olio, the prawns were so fresh, love it! The Eggs Benedict were good too.
One great thing is that they don't have service charge and GST.
4
Nice New York cheesecake, just a lil bit dry, otherwise it'll b perfect. Nice coffee, we had a latte and an ice cappuccino, one last thing: if the staffs could smile more often, not too serious then i'd rate it 5stars :).
3
The atmosphere is nice with lots of toy cats and dogs as decoration. It's a relaxing place for friends meet-up. It's crowded during weekends brunch time and quite noisy. Ordered Fresh Prawn aglio olio with Flat White. Flavor wise it ok but no highlights.
3
Accessible via train .. Its located at Holland village.. The pancakes were really amazing. Cozy place with self service.. Worth trying
3
The cafe is nicely decorated. Ordered the shabu shabu soup pasta and a pizza. Came in during 6-8pm and am entitled to order coffee/dessert/soup each for $3. So decided to spend $6 for soup and dessert. Bad choice.Mushroom soup was diluted (you will probably get better soup from a can) and triple chocolate is just a small scope of ice cream that is hardly worth $3.Students get 10% off when you show your student card. No discount for me. Be prepare to wait for your food (20mins) when the cafe is crowded.

The pancakes served at D'Good Cafe are not the typical breakfast pancake stacks. They're individually served in fry pans and have both sweet and savory toppings. The chorizo and squid pancake was good and can be coupled with a fruit juice or followed by a yummy dessert or one of the many coffees or flavors of tea. Seating is on the second and third floor at tables or on swings. Love the decor. Everything is self-serve, so you find a seat, decide what you want and go to order at the counter on the second floor. Fun atmosphere. Just don't expect to be waited on :

Though I've been in Singapore for a while, I never make it out to Holland Village and I was pleasantly surprised with all of the wonderful brunch options. I went to D'Good on a Sunday morning around 1030 and stayed until about 1300. D'Good Cafe seemed to be on the cheaper side for brunch options compared to the other offerings in the neighborhood. I was very excited to try the squid and chorizo Dutch pancake but I was disappointed with the somewhat soggy texture of the pancake - I am not sure what I was expecting but it was anticlimatic. Seemed like they put a runny diced tomato with the tiniest bits of chorizo and squid rings on top and called it a day. There are many options for coffee - it all seemed very cool as you can get your coffee hand brewed in multiple ways, e.g. chemex, syphon, paper filter. However, I was too intimidated to try any of it as there were people in line behind me...If you're a coffee noob, you may want to learn/trial when it is less busy. I had the white coffee cold brew and the cold chocolate drink - both were scrumptious and rich in flavor. I would come back for a coffee catch up with a friend and might even try a food item on the menu despite my lackluster experience with the Dutch pancake. The place is very instagram friendly with murals and quotes painted on the walls, as well as a small artificial turf area indoors with two swing sets. There is also a rooftop patio area. The cafe is on both the 2nd and 3rd floors - there are multiple steps and stairways. It did get a bit loud from around noon but you may find the outdoor patio area more calming. The Christian church music streaming from the speakers may bother some people but well, it was a Sunday

Previously came here maybe twice before but didn't think much about their menu and the varieties. This time, I was impressed!! The pancake was wonderful. And quite a variety too! Both savoury and sweet.Definitely an improvement in menu. They still have the sweet potato waffles but didn't too much about it from the last time. Will come again to try other things.Actually so excited with the pancake to check what other new stuff there is!! ;
3
Nice enough place in Holland Village but be warned it's on 3 levels so there's lots of stairs. The menu seems a bit limited but the Cold Brew coffee comes in a bottle and is refreshing on a hot day and the Dutch pancakes were good. I do think they should ditch the call buzzer system though and bring food to your table - you expect a bit of service
4
Only discovered recently but have been a few times. Remember it is a seld service cafe. If u keep that in mind then u will have great meal. Easy...order..pay...collect. Staff is friendly and decor is cute. Various seating options ...swings...couches..Chairs...and roof terrace. Great place for easy meetuo with friends.I love the earl grey lavender tea latte! Order the delish poached eggs on huge mushrooms - tasty and filling with normal price for singapore. Expect to pay approx $13 for a meal and $5 for a drink!
4
Great coffee and good food. Dutch skillet pancakes have a 30min wait, but they are really good.
There is space upstairs for studying and the wifi is fast and reliable. The air con is set really cold though, so take a jacket!
4
We enjoy popping over to D'Good cafe. The coffee is really good and we enjoy it.
I would however like a few more healthier options on the menu like fruit salad and green salad.
But other than that for coffee it's a great treat 👌
4
The cafe is cozy and they even have a outside rooftop area but it will be a little warm in the afternoon so i recommend indoor, will definitely choose outside in the evening. Staff is very friendly and explained to us how to order. We tried their seafood lobster bisque pasta, tom yum pasta and mocha frappe. Food & drinks are nice, will definitely visit again. Maybe soon..

In Summary:Skip this place.*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:Was there with my partner for brunch and we were initially impressed by the raving reviews found online. The first impression was good, with a nicely decorated doorway and stairs leading to the café. However, this was where the good part of the review ends.1. Service – 2 out of 5Non-existent. Unless you count the vibrating thing that tells you that food is ready as part of your service experience. It is simply a self-service café that refers its price to cafes that provides much better service. This is made worse by the fact that you will have to carry your trays filled with drinks and food up the staircase if you are seated on level three. Quick-tip: you can choose to ignore the vibrating thing and after about half-an-hour, the service crew may actually bring the food up for you at no additional cost hurray. That’s what the group of guys beside us did.2. Ambiance – 3.5 out of 5Well the place does look good and feels great to be in. However, it is not practical if the customers have to carry their food up the stairs themselves. If you are seated on the level where the kitchen is, you will not have to carry the food up the stairs BUT you will stink thanks to the funky ventilation.3. Cleanliness – 3 out of 5Crumbs were left everywhere, from the tables to chairs. It did not help that the tables were white4. Taste – 1 out of 5Well, if you like food from Singapore Airlines, you will definitely love the food here. Portions were small and the freshness of the ingredients is questionable. Food is cold, probably due to the staff being too busy taking orders at the counter and activating your vibrating thing a while after. Not to mention that it takes a whole forty minutes to prepare two simple plates of breakfast without much of a crowd. A complete lack of effort can be seen from the poor presentation of food. 5. Value for Money – 1 out of 5Will you pay $15 for a plate of sandwich that you can purchase at a convenience store for much less
2
 Ow, wrong choice...SGD 15 for one coffee and a piece of a medium sized cheesecake in a self service place...Messy queue when you enter and staff is not helping much.After ordering you can carry your own McDonald's like tray to the seating area which is a bit too noisy. Some decoration could help to mute.The coffee is flat, or too weak and misses crema.The cheesecake looks nice, but the flavor is bland.Time to step up guys
2
This place has some really nice decore and a very relaxing roof top patio. Unfortunately, the staff needs to be better trained. I ordered waffles for my son and Eggs Benedict for me. Like most humans, I like to eat meals together with my family. The eggs came a full 30 minutes before the waffles. When I asked, they explained that the waffle iron needed time to warm up. When I suggested that they turn it on first thing in the morning as a general practice, they explain that mine was the first order for waffles that day! Nice business logic!Also, their menu listed maple syrup for the pancakes and waffles. I asked whether it was REAL maple syrup or artificial. The staff seemed confused by this question and showed me a bottle of maple-flavored corn syrup. There is a huge difference between the two! The real stuff comes from, you guessed it, maple trees and heavenly. The artificial stuff taste like crap and is one of the most unhealthy things you can put in your body. Overall, quite disappointing
3
Came here for brunch, ordered the fruits pancake with minimum waiting time of half an hour?! Is not even a warm lava chocolate cake. Also had the frrench toast with berries which was interesting. I liked the earl lavender latte. My friend enjoyed the salted oolong tea. But she said the 2nd cup she had did not taste consistent as the sugar syrup was not melted as thoroughly as the 1st cup and she could taste bits of sugar syrup. Hits and misses
4
I enjoy the coffee here, it is from excellent quality coffee beans! The ideal spot for true coffee lovers.There are two levels where you can sit and enjoy your coffee. Inside and outside area.The staff are friendly and I also love the concept behind the cafe!
2
Had a latte and mocha here, the mocha was way too sweet so I guess they weren't using dark chocolate. The mocha also had a very sour after taste, I compared it to the latte which had a veryyyy slightly sour after taste, so I'm not sure if it was the chocolate? Definitely not my type of coffee though, seeing how everyone else raved about it.Also tried the english breakfast, which was mediocre at best, with its toast being the best item on the plate. My portobello eggs ben was great, but the portion was over priced, just two eggs, two mushrooms and some salad for $14.50 (if I'm not wrong).Ambience was good, with swing seats and attic seats as well
4
If ever you are in Holland Village, this is almost a mandatory stop It's a cozy little place with good coffee, delicious food & pastries and very pleasant staff. It occupies a multi-level place so make sure you check out the different areas for the best seat.It's a nice place to hang out, relax, have a pleasant conversation with friends or just enjoy the quiet scenery of Holland Road. The prices are also very reasonable.We really loved the interior and the interesting items that adorn the cafe. Just glad we were brought here (even if it was far from where we stay).Tips: The outside sign is a bit small so if you can't find it, ask around. The best seats would be the swings that face the window
4
It's one of those places where every corner has something to offer. All the floors are different as well as all the rooms. Food is great and staff nice. Perfect place for a romantic date. The roof top garden is cool in the morning.
4
A wonderful place to chill...
the food & coffee are good...
Great location...right next to Holland MRT
This place gets pretty crowded at times...&
increasingly difficult to find table...
I'd reccommend the management to implement a wait/seating system...during peak hours.
5
Lovely coffees just love them (with bear arts, so cute).
Lots of soft toys and small table and chairs for the lil ones. Great lil place for the whole family to hang. Tiny stairs so walk slowly.
4
I always come back here when I have a craving for their Oysters and Shimeji Aglio Olio. It's really good.
4
this is quite a chill place for an afternoon coffee. especially love the swing seats by the windows, lovely place for a girls tea session. the food could be better though.
3
A nice place to hang out with friends. Food is pretty okay and the staff were friendly in terms of assisting me with my orders. Free wifi as well!
4
Nice layout spread out over 2-3 floors with roof garden. Coffee is great, they limit Internet which is great to avoid laptop junkies
3
Was there during Christmas gift exchange with my friends. A great cafe for gathering, chit chat with friends. They served all day breakfast set, pasta and pizzas. Food was tasty, price was alright. Will be come again.

Dined here last week with my family around lunch time. This multistorey café has three sections. The ordering area which feels cramped with display of coffee grinding machine and other display items. The main dining room with two swings facing the main road is much preferred dining area as the terrace/Al fresco dining area is a level above. On that particular day, the lift was down and it was a hassle for the patrons to make multiple trips up and down the narrow flight of stairs.We ordered, cream of mushroom for starters, chicken pesto pasta and mushroom pizza for mains. The cream of mushroom was excellent. The pesto chicken pasta was average as the baked chicken was over cooked and dry. The pizza was good. Generous amount of cheese and mushrooms but the pizza crust was a let down. It was neither crispy nor soft. It was chewy! Since it was lunch time, they were pretty packed and the staff took time to clear the plates so I ended up clearing the plates as I went to collect my food. Food was tasty and reasonably priced. A decent café at Holland Village
4
Visited this nice and cosy cafe last Sunday. Again it was my girl who wanted to go so we went.It was crowded during lunch time but the crowd moving fast.Environment was nice and good place for fellowship. There were 2 swings facing the windows where you were able to view outside.Pasta were nice but the portion was not so big for big eater.Location was good just near by Holland Village MRT station
4
We were here as a group of long-time friends to rest our feet and enjoy a quiet afternoon of coffee. The barista was charming to create an endearing latte art to wish my friend a happy birthday! How nice!
3
I would probably go back again for the decor and the laid back setup, not so much for the food. They provide set lunch on weekdays at 20$ which includes a soup, mains and a drink. I didn't try the dessert but they looked good.
4
The dining venue tonight was set at D'Good Cafe, a lovely cafe with three stories, pretty decor and a manually-operated elevator. The 2nd story was where bar counter was, as well as the water and food collection points.We took the stairs up to Level 3, and I was surprised by the lovely little trinkets brightening up normal stairwell corners. It was really pretty overall - creating a little bit of fairyland cum vintage look to it all - flowers , postal boxes, etc. I glimpsed a long white swing on Level 2's seating area as well.While waiting for *Sharona and *Nadine to arrive, we decided to start with cakes. I had the Strawberry Cheesecake (SGD$9.00) that came with a gelish / jellyish layer encrusting real fruits within. The cake was fluffy in its cheesy richness, and melted in the mouth. The red jellyish layer was not too sweet, and the strawberries added a lovely flavor to the cake.*Chantal chose the Triplet Cheese Cake (SGD$9.50) - chocolate , cheese and rich dark chocolate (Oreo?) base topped with a chocolate macaroon atop. Texture was good - soft and sticky without being gooey, the cake managed to retain fluffiness despite its solid form. The flavors were lovely blend of chocolate and cheese, and the macaroon was not too sweet.For mains, *Nadine had the Shimeiji Oysters Pasta - touch choice deciding between the Oysters Poached Egg Pasta and this, but this won eventually. The pasta was done well - springy and boungy, and the pearl oysters were fresh and chewy. The tiny mushrooms and salmon roe added to the texture and flavor of the pasta. It was a delicious treat, especially when *Nadine and I loved oysters.I had the Baked Lemongrass Chicken (SGD$17.50) that was accompanied by mashed potato (with real potato chunks), mushrooms and zucchini. The chicken was rather tender, and the mashed potato was good. In fact, I'd say that the chicken was flavorful - just that the hints of lemongrass was weak, almost undetectable.For full review and more photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/dinner-at-dgood-cafe-holland-village.htm

We were staying in Holland Village for three weeks and this place became our local coffee shop. We like hot coffee and a lot of coffee shops like to serve warm coffee as does D'good cafe. After a few conversations with the baristas we finally got the coffee the way we like it. It seems baristas seem to think we drink it too hot but as far as we are concerned there is nothing worse than receiving a luke warm coffee that you then have to drink in a few minutes otherwise it is cold. Even if it is the baristas training or way of thinking I cannot understand why they will not happily do what the customer asks, so many say it will burn the milk if it is too hot and yes I agree but I am not asking for it to be 'extra hot', I just want my coffee to be hot, say 65-68° . I really wish baristas would be more accommodating to customers wishes, especially after reading their website, where it says they want their customers to be happy and if you are not happy with coffee, let us know and we will make it the way you want it. Anyway we finally got it the way we like it and we were there every day for three weeks, it is the best coffee, made to perfection with coffee\milk ratio,poured beautifully, the right strength. We were so happy to find this place so close to our accommodation in Holland Village. The staff were very good and we had the bacon, rocket toasted panini a few times and enjoyed. Thank you for great coffe

The cafe occupies 3 levels so there's plenty of seating available. The entrance (with stairs) is visible from street view. However the entrance (for the lift) is hidden behind the clinic. Read the instructions on how to operate the lift with care. Food is passable, drinks were alright. The marbled salted cheesecake is worth a try though - kinda like a mix between cheesecake and sneakers (if you like the combi). Other than the usual cafe staple of sandwiches, they also serve pastas and mains for dinner. Upon paying, you collect your drinks and you are handed a cafe-buzzer. When the food is ready, the buzzer alerts and you can go collect your food. Self-service all the way. Price of food is typical cafe pricing with an average of $15 for pasta dishes and $9 on average for a slab of cake. The design is whimsical and romantic. Wonderful if you are going for a date or if you just wanna chill out and catch up with friends. I was seated at the alfresco corner - no air con but the slight breeze was sufficient to be comfortable despite Singapore's humid weather
2
The decoration is quite good but the rest...Start from that it is very cold inside. After we paid Sgd40 for 2 eggs and coffee our order was forgotten. After 30 minutes we went to the counter where was confirmed that they missed the order.. So we had 20 minutes more to wait. Eggs were cold/ and really not good with sweet toast (???). Conclusion: never ever coming back!

D'Good Cafe is actually located in an inconspicuous spot.I say "inconspicuous" because I've walked past it a few times and have seen the white sign board hanging from the ceiling of the public walkway, but i've never thought of visiting the place any sooner until one night when my friend and i was looking for an alternative cuppa place than Starbucks. To date, I've been to D'Good for four times over the last two months.-VARIETY & CAPPA-D'Good Cafe boasts a wide range of coffee beans which patrons can choose from.Every hot drink also comes with a pretty picture done by latte art.My favourite drink from D'Good would be the hot Green Tea Latte.Looking at just the menu and or what's written on the chalk boards on the cafe walls are not enough. For instance, warm Green Tea latte wasn't written anywhere in the menu but it is available, therefore ask so that you may receive. So far, i've tried Green Tea latte and Mocha Frap. The green tea latte is rich, thick and has a good balance between the taste of green tea and milk. The dark green green tea foam is a little bitter, as how it should taste, but the drink that lies underneath it is sweet and creamy. The Mocha frap was creamy, blended finely with ice and had a relatively strong coffee taste.I have not tried the warm/hot variations of their coffee, so i am unable to comment. My friend however, had a cup of hot mocha and she enjoyed very much. A good indicator from all of us (the different friends whom i brought along) is that the cuppa and frap that D'Good serves, is very decent and "better than starbucks".Juices and drinks like Sunrise are freshly pressed in house, which is wonderful of course.-MAIN COURSES-D'Good cafe serves a wide variety of main courses: from the usual brunch (bacon, egg benedict menu $12), they also have pasta in different bases ($14-$16), pizza ($20), sandwiches and an interesting dish of Chicken Tikka with Japanese rice (S13-$14).I ordered the chicken alfredo linguine. As an avid fan of pasta, i'd say that the alfredo was mediocre. I did not like the chicken breast as they were very dry, tasteless and not well marinated. The pasta was tender and it went well with the alfredo. I thought my main was a little dry even though i did not add any cheese powder. If i added some powder too, maybe it would have tasted better and richer. While i did not try the pizza, i saw some people having it and at $12, it looked quite value for money. -AMBIENCE & SETTINGS-D'Good cafe is really like Alice in the wonderland.Level 2 of the cafe looks quite like the usual from the door, but walk into it and you'd immediately notice a swing and faux grass patches where you know you can sit comfortably to enjoy the outside view as you sip on a nice drink.Level 3 of the cafe is another paradise all together: there's an indoor and outdoor area.The outdoor area (turn left from lift) gives you a nice alfresco dining feel. It's the perfect place to lounge and have an after dinner cuppa. The soft dim lightings also adds to the romantic ambience. I like the background christmas music that was played, it was absolutely serenading.The air-conditioned space in level 3 has a hint of a child's playroom cum home living room style. Three gigantic stuffed bears are placed in the space and they are free for anyone to take pictures/ have coffee with. There's also a children's area (little tables and chairs) and two rocking horses that toddles can play on.OTHER MENTIONS1. There's an elevator within the cafe that can fit up to 4 people in it. It'd take you from the lobby (level 1) all the way to Level 2 and or Level 3. It's a wonderful experience to be taking the lift as you might for a split second feel like you're in a sci-fi movie, on the way to an important science laboratory. Own musement aside, the installation of life in the cafe is thougtful in my opinion as it is perfect for heavily expecting mothers-to-be, the elderly or the physically challenged.2. The Cafe does not accept any reservations unless you're looking to book the place for an event. If such is a case, then you will have to write in to the management.3. Few people know this but if you visit the cafe on your actual birthday, you can actually ask for a birthday frappe when you order your frappe. A birthday frappe is coffee served in a gigantic cup aka an ikea vase.Please press the "helpful vote" button if you think this review gave you some good insight. your affirming vote would be rewarding, for my time and effort spent in writing this. cheers

Oh I love this place simply for the fact that it has a swing?Now where can you find swings nowadays? Some parks don't even have it!What's better then sipping a cuppa and swinging away?The faux grass carpet was a bit prickly so don't take off your shoes

I was so excited initially to visit this cafe because of the reviews and the pretty latte art photos that I saw in your facebook page. I would say that the ambience of this place is really commendable, with the pretty fairy lights at the roof top and the swings facing out, it makes one feels like one is at home. However, yesterday was the worst evening of my life so far when I was at D'good cafe (totally opposite of good), because I was caught in between a hungry stomach and an almost empty menu. Besides, my group of friends and I planned to hold a surprise birthday celebration for the birthday girl. We all reached at around 7.45pm, took awhile to decide on our orders. But in the end, we were force to leave because we found out that 80% or almost 90% of the menu ran out of order at 8pm? I thought the cafe closes at 9pm! & I thought you all "want to offer customers everything good". I was utterly disappointed. Even the service was atrocious - No smile, no recommendations even food went out of order, no service recovery, no extra mile. I believe most people have heard of this saying, "A hungry man is an angry man". That was how we all felt at that moment. If I'd know earlier that there will be a shortage of food, and we would be served in such lousy service, I wouldn't have recommended this place to my friends and specially make a trip down to this "good" cafe at all. In the end we had to walk out of the cafe with an empty stomach :

I went with a couple of friends for a Sunday afternoon coffee in Holland Village and stumbled upon this inconspicuous café. The ambience is perfect to just sit and have a nice lazy afternoon coffee. The place was full and we were seated on level 2, although level 3 seemed much cosier. The coffees were excellent and the service was pretty good. Looking forward to going back
