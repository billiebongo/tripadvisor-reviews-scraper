Went tot the restaurant for a meal to celebrate my wife's promotion. Order some dim sum, congee and noodle for our small family. Quality did not disappoint us and we have a very full lunch with good service provided by the staff.

Review by Dr Sim. Food is good. Prices are a bit expensive for the food served. Service is acceptable but slow. Tourists can try. Regard Dr Sim

We are utterly disappointed with the queuing system. We understand on the need of Long queue as it was a PH . However , while we are waiting to get a Q number issue by the waitress, there was a customer who seem to know thwaitress and asked for a earlier Q number despite a Long Q behind her. We approached the Waitress and the customer and the customer was then issued with a number later than the rest. However, after waiting for 30mins, this customer who has the later Q number was asked to go in and her number was changed to an earlier number. This seem unfair to the rest of the customers who have been waiting for so Long. Upon questioning, the waitress was shocked and offer to give us a seat immediately. We have rejected the offer as it was the principle of Queuing and what about the rest of the customer who are still waiting. We hope that the management can look into this matter to avoid it from happening again.

I loved the dimsum here. You always join as member on the spot to enjoy the privilege. At present, there is 40% discount if you come from 3.00 to 6.00 pm on weekdays only. How ever the discount dors not apply to roasted meat and noodles. I would recommend the baked char siow pau, the rest are equally as good

This restaurant serves dim sum and great chinese food. My kids like their bubble tea. It is served chilled in a tub of ice so as not to dilute the tea! They are part of a chain and I ate at another of their restaurant, Paradise Dynasty. The quality of the food is just as great. Service is awesome too

We finally managed recently to visit this restaurant for the first time since Compass One mall re-opened. It would have been sooner had it not been for the fact that the queues here are usually quite considerable on weekends, The queues were still there but we were seated with fifteen minutes. As we were there for lunch, we opted for dim sum-themed dishes supplemented with a roast pork combo and xiaolongbao (steamed dumplings). The food took a while to arrive, perhaps contributed by what appeared to be a non-stop procession of orders from the kitchen to delivery riders. Anyway, we had a pleasant lunch there, one that hopefully won't too long to the next

The 50% promotion is just a gimmick which you must be a member to benefit this promotion. With these 50% off, there is a big crowd. We ordered 10 dishes for 3 person consumption. Most of the dishes are having fried portion. There are some food which is either you like it or not such as steamed rice roll with sweet & peanut sauce. With the 50% promotion, the food is average.

Had trio-combi congree which allows you to pick any 3 main ingredient for the congree and the cute piglet salted egg bun. Both are great.Setting is a little tight but sufficient space for moving along the aisle. Warm and cosy feel. Suitable for family and friends. Child seat available

A must try restaurant. Simple made perfect but for all things good you need to be willing to pay the price. 50sGD per person to truly say you've tried the specialties of the house.

Decided to have a dinner there with my family. Ordered quite a lot and service was not too bad except for times where all the staff are engaged. Some food also took longer time to come but overall ok.

Just the 2 of us at the restaurant to celebrate my birthday. Love the food there especially the signature chat siew pork belly and the char siew bao. Service was a bit unattentive despite restaurant not full.

My family went to this restaurant to celebrate my brother in law's birthday. We liked their tim sum and porridge. Fast and good service, the food is delicious too.

For a mall restaurant quite impressive. Mid-priced and authentic foods. Duck was excellent and the pork was good. Ask for extra green chilies with the noodles

Ordered a beef with scallions dish. More like a plate of stir-fried scallions. Asked the waiter to explain where the beef was. Reply: The dish is like this. Used chopsticks to find 7 thin slices of beef under the scallions. Asked the manager where the rest of the beef was, surely 7 thin small slices and a plate scallions costing $16.95++ would be a little more substantial. Reply: The dish is like this. Sweet and sour pork had 8 pieces with bits of pineapple and peppers. Tofu dish was ok. Veggie (kai lan) was like half a pack from ntuc. Never again. Went to Subway afterwards to top up. Better value there. Imitation 'fine dining' Cantonese cuisine. Cantonese portions are supposed to be generous, not so fine that there are no or limited main ingredients in the dishes. Nowhere near Hong Kong or Canton standards. Other restaurants like Crystal Jade etc is better and more value for money. To be fair, the flavour of the dishes were actually quite good

Had friends telling me about how difficult to get seats at Canton Paradise and how yummy are their food. So, decided to try out after hearing so many good things about this restaurant. As usual, the queue was long but fast though. They issued queeu numbers based on the number of diners you have which I find that it is a good system. While waiting, they provided patrons an ordering sheet just like the way Din Tai Fung did so to cut down waiting time. The selections for dim sum aren't that much which I find it a pity. Anyway, my friends and I managed to order quite a few dishes and they were served quite fast. The dishes aren't really that impressive, finding them quite ok. The only dishes that will make me crave for more are the salted egg fried crispy fish skin and deep fried eggplant with floss. The fish skins are very rich and flavorful that makes me reaching it non-stop. Quite addictive and anyone who love fish skins should give it a try. As for the eggplant, I'm not a eggplant eater but I enjoyed this dish as it does not taste like eggplant at all. Overall, I won't really queue for this restaurant unless friends or family insisted to have it. Cause, given the price we paid, we can get better, nice and cheaper dim sums elsewhere like dim sum buffet @ some hotels or restaurants

I have been to this restaurant a few times but time and again am shaken by the incredibly bad service and the rudeness of the wait staff. You can be talking but the wait staff walks off. No one will come to you if you raise your hand. The waiting for a table despite reservation is horrendous. It's disorganized. It's crazy at the wait area. I think management should step in and do something positive. It's consistently a horrific experience and it's bad enough for me to forego coming here when there are so many dim sum restaurants everywhere. Disappointing and upset. I can't even talk about the food as a result.

Went to Biopolis (scientific research centres) & my buddy professor took us out for lunch. Where do I start..peking duck so amazing that I couldn't help taking videos. 6 people & we ordered like for 10. But the food was extraordinary. Definitely the best Chinese Ever!

Came here for Dim Sum with my in-laws. Food and service is good. Staffs is very friendly. However a very bad impression when was lead to our table. The sofa were badly stain and so are some of the chairs. It look like is moulded. This is an ugly sight with a big chain and well reputation restaurant. A bit disappointed with this branch.

This restaurant is located in the public housing heartland of Singapore. Easy access by public transport (train and buses). Reasonable priced food and dim sum, but still some way to go before the taste and quality could be on par with the best on offer in Singapore. The roasted meat and duck were also a little disappointing

While the menu is standard Hong Kong dim sum fare, it reminds me so much of my childhood days when dim sum was very greasy. Taro puffs looked very good but were rather greasy to eat. Spring rolls were dripping in oil. The paper lining the plate was soaked in oil.Cheong fun with scallops was a real let down. The portion was so tiny to begin with. I didn't taste or see any scallops at all! In fact, there didn't seem to be any filling inside. The texture of the cheong fun was very good, though.The only thing we enjoyed was the spinach with three types of eggs. Even then, I've tasted far better versions in other restaurants.The branch I visited was at The Star Vista. The place was packed with lunchtime crowds, but I won't be going back

I had heard many positive reviews about this restaurant from colleagues. Since Crystal Jade had closed some months ago, I was eagerly anticipating the dim sum for lunch. It was sadly disappointing. The classic siew Mai was fatty and wet, the radish cake tasteless and the pork spare ribs very disappointing. Not as good as CJ nor Imperial Treasure to be honest and surprisingly poor given what I had heard from others. We also got scolded for making a mess with the chili sauce that had no spoon!

When you leave a restaurant asking yourself why you had dined there yet again despite never having enjoyed any of your meals there, it is time to bid adieu to it permanently! Canton Paradise at CompassPoint has the dubious honour of being such a restaurant. Food served is mediocre: portions are small; price is expensive (a bowl of plain congee is $2.50++!?) ; ambience - non existent and service is poor. If one can't think of even a positive point about the restaurant, surely it must be black-listed.Our bill for lunch for two people came up to be S$54.97 (would have been higher if I'd not refused the wet napkins and small dish of peanuts). "The Garoupa fillet with Ginger" was not only too oily but was more like a plate of onions and spring onions with negligible number of fish slices. Although the "Kai Lan with Superior sauce" consisted of fresh crunchy vegetables, it was too expensive at S$10.80 for just a few shoots of kailan cooked in a very ordinary way. "The Fried Rice with Egg' was also too oily and bland, not palatable to say the least.When a restaurant includes a service charge to its bill, one would expect to, at least, get some complimentary warm water. Canton Paradise, unlike other restaurants, charges 30cents plus 10% service charge plus 7% GST per glass. When the waiter finally brought it to me mid-way through my meal, I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw that the glass was only three quarters filled. What was even more distasteful was the fact that the glass was filled with stain! Of course I asked the waiter to return to my table and take it away. Although this restaurant seems to be crowded most of the time (probably due to its relatively more extensive menu), I would certainly not recommend it

Went there for dim sum during lunch last weekend. A bit disappointed as I find the standard has dropped. The siew mai and the deep fried bean curd roll were only passable. The char siew baked buns were served cold and the portion of the scallop cheong fun was pathetic

This is a review of the Canton Paradise at the Star Vista Mall. All the outlets for the Canton Paradise chain are located in or next to transport hubs. This particular one is right next to the Commonwealth MRT Station.There's only one thing here that's really worth trying, The crispy roast pork bun, menu item A1. It's a play on the Hong Kong classic, Po Lo Char Siew Pau. It really is good and worth your time and effort. The hoary exterior of this creature is a rapidly crumbling crust that melts away to reveal the light and almost barely imperceptible skin of gossamer dough, just enough of a physical presence to structurally contain the sweet, savoury offering of fatty char siew, flavoured just this side of heavenly and a hair shy of naughty, the sauce redolent of pork fat. It's good and it shows because they always run quick and early.The roast meats are nothing short of mediocre. Very uninteresting. In my very humble opinion, I had a much better roast duck and roast pork at the Grand Park City Hall Chinese restaurant, Park Palace. The Pork Belly Char Siew looked so promising and I've included a photo to prove it. The meat was resistant and the fat had not been rendered, which left it rubbery. The sauce was nice enough, but not enough to hide the fact that this nice hunk of pork had been ruined. Shame.My default place for a respectable utility Cantonese meal remains Crystal Jade. For a good quality meal no place beats Hua Ting.Canton Paradise is just a-ok. It really is

Had a very disappointing brunch at Canton Paradise Star Vista. The "famous" large wonton noodle soup was a real letdown... Soup was tasteless, those shrimp wantons were not fresh... The shrimp dumplings had skin that fell apart the minute you lifted it up and likewise, shrimp that had been sliced and diced and wrapped together...It was more unfortunate for my takeaways... The soup takeaway containers got dented, 2 of them opened under the improper packing and my family had to have wanton soup without the soup.The rest of the dim sums came off the bag soaked in soup stock... Service and food standards was never this bad... What happened? I won't be back unless they take on more responsibility to ensure quality food and service..

I went in this restaurant for 4 or 5 times for lunch. I like very much to eat their dim sum. We can't say its succulent but it's honest. I eat some pork belly and I love it too. The service is efficient. They have few restaurant in Singapore. I like to go at canton paradise buena vista. Love this mall. The parking is free for lunch except week end

we visited canton Paradise for our traditional Sunday Dim Sum treat. teh Dim Sum part of the experience was great though the whole meal is pricey and the non dim sum dishes not impressive. We ended up the lunch at 111 SGD which for 3 adulss and 2 kids under 6 ( who always share our dishes ) is not too light. As others also noticed, charging for the towels or the pickles is not a positive point. however, charging 4.20 SGD for mini egg tart is just wrong.....I liked the ordering system which leaves you time to choose and the freedom to chase that all that you ordered has arrived ( you note it yourself on a separate sheet and the waiter/ress collects your order). Like most mall restaurants , it was way too cold and the design albeit very "chinese" will not be remembered. Toilets are outside the restaurant in the mall so make sure the kids pee before lunch...Now, people are queuing outside so they probably know the dim sum are tasty ( Bakes BBQ pork pastries and siew mai had my vote ). We wont probably come back for the food but may give it another go if we are in the mall and hungry for good dim sums..

We chanced upon this great restaurant when we were looking for a good eating place to celebrate our son's 21st birthday. Fortunately we made a reservation as it was quite well patronised.We decided to order the following dim sum dishes:- Crispy BBQ Honey Pork Bun, Steamed Custard Bun, Steamed Shanghai Pork Dumpling, Mini Egg tart, Baked BBQ Pork Pastry and Wok fried Cheong fun with XO Chilli Sauce.The Crispy BBQ Honey Pork Bun came just as the name suggested. Nice crispy bun with honey pork filling. This was one of our favorite dishes or maybe because it was the first dish that came and we were all hungry.. The Steamed Shanghai pork Dumpling and Wok fried Cheong fun with XO Chilli Sauce came a very close second. The other dim sum dishes were not too far off.We did not get to try any of the alacarte dishes, but we would definitely go back again another day to do so. In fact, this is one of the best dim sum places that we have tried so far
