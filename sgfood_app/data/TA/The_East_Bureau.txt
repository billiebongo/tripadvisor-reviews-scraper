This is a hidden gem! We ordered the set lunch here and it was $10 for a 3 course meal which was very flavour filled and I would recommend this.

I really loved the place for its atmosphere, with the outdoor rooftop. But the food was average.
We had one rice and noodle dish, and both were too spicy, destroying the other flavors in the dish.
The staff was very friendly.

Food fusion was OK. We tried about 10 dishes in total but about 3 of them were ordinary. The rest were interesting and most of them were spicy.

Spacious layout. Comfortable space. Decent selection on menu with affordable price. Not too pricey. Food are delicious too! The view is great. Can chose between indoor or outdoor seating.

Well worth a visit. We loved this restaurant and ate here twice. A short walk if your staying at the Marina Mandarin Hotel.

This one was tricky: we needed a mix of local food, non-seafood, reasonable spice level, veg options - and out of the ordinary. The East Bureau offers all that, in a hipster/ Asian environment. Easy to book, prompt service, and fusion food that our diners found quite tasty. Just that... we were told they're closing this outlet (Suntec) end of April. They say they have two more restaurants - but it's a loss for those around the area

We had the pleasure of stumbling across this beautiful little spot for dinner this evening. The decor and atmosphere was inviting, I loved all the little details. Our waiter was so lovely and made some recommendations for us which were all right on the money! A great way to experience a wide range of dishes, especially ones you may not normally order. Thank you for a beautiful dinner guys

My partner and I came here twice during our 4 day stay in Singapore. Always seems to be happy hour which is great, it isn't too expensive and has a great outdoor area where you can see the laser show at Marina Bay. The staff are friendly and attentive and the food is magnificent (except for the whole deep fried shrimp, that wasn't for us) but the gyoza and edamame were amazing. Thanks for the memories! This is definitely our go to when in Singapore moving forward

Third time here and highly recommended: selection of fusion dishes from the region; modern pseudo-antique decoration; view on the Durian and the CDB skyscrapers. Any occasion, you can't go wrong.

Situated at the rooftop garden of the new wing at Marina Square, it offers a good view of the Esplanade, the office towers of the CBD and MBS. Food is east-west fusion, quite delightful especially when paired with drinks. They offer an Okinawan Orion beer on tap and the happy hour prices make it taste even better. Skip the Asahi and go for the Orion as it is better value and taste as good if not better.Its a stone throw away from One Raffles Link where 2 banks have their main premises, though not many of the employees seem to have discovered this hidden spot. Great spot to unwind after work, or to catch up on the latest office gossip. It has both indoor and outdoor seatings, though the outdoor ones seem more popular. Especially great after a rain shower when the air is fresh and cool. Not so great during the haze though, which fortunately remained under control this year

Very reasonably priced porridge buffet for Sunday lunch in a picturesque roof garden in Marina Square. Three varieties of porridge and we tried the century egg one and the sweet potato one. Free flow of dishes that can be ordered. We loved the taupok, minced pork with black beans, sweet and sour pork, pork in salted egg, omelette with tang chye and belly pork. Service was somewhat hesitant but it was overall a good experience and we will be back.

Came here for after work drinks this week. The view is impressive and the food reasonable. I was a little disappointed on this visit by the lacklustre service: several times we had to go inside to get our drinks organised due to an apparent lack of interest from the staff. But otherwise all was good

The East Bureau doesnt really sound like a dining place.It doesnt even sound like a bar.But dont be fooled because it is a really charming restaurant with an al fresco hard to beat, plus a good selection of beverages!The crew is a friendly bunch, prices kept affordable so do check it out.Recommended : Pan Asian dishes + cold beer

This place has very different and interesting theme, and some uniques pieces of furnitureA very good view of Singapore with available terrace seating Happy hour M-TLunch specials are very good mostly... I recommend the poached sea bass Service is friendly but not very attentive

The view from this restaurant is spectacular - either from outside on the terrace or inside the cool air-conditioned interior. The food is ok - nothing special to be honest, and not that hot either, but it was tasty. Probably best to come here for a snack and drink, or small bite rather than a large meal but to eat outside with such a view is a welcome alternative to the malls

There aren't many dining place on the island left that provide a great view of the city skyline without having to pay through your nose, or having to call in to make a reservation and pretend that you are someone.I'd say, The East Bureau is a fantastic place to dine or chill out after a day of shopping or just to have a business chit chat to the city breeze (hot or cooling) and a glimpse of the glorious outline of MBS and Esplanade against the blue sky.Food, palatable and passable. Rice was too hard. Dumplings are even harder. Honestly, we have yet to taste anything good out of fusion cuisine, so we really didn't have very high hope when we entered. We were just famished and we refused to settle for fast food.We were certainly impressed with the service. Not everyone gave the smile, but the staff and manager (seemingly) were definitely very attentive and we'd like to applause to that.Return to have a quick bite and drink, certainly. Dinner? Mmmm.......maybe not
