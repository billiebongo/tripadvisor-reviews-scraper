Didn't warm to this place as much. Service was rather cold, and couldn't find the sugar, or any stirrers. Not a place I would return to in a hurry.
3
If not for the 1-for-1 coupon with the entertainer, I would never have walked into this dark place. The food is average at best, the place in need of a fresh coat of paint and the glass display needs a good wipe.
3
Came back here again today for brunch and opted for the eggs royale and a smoothie. All quite tasty and served efficiently. Friendly service. Servings are just a little on the small side, but otherwise all good.
3
Went to have a coffee and get some work done on my laptop. The service is ok, if you like to go to the bar to get a drink, which is on the ground floor. There is no waiter service. Furthermore, the internet is unstable.

I am a coffee snob. And after having tried multiple coffee places in singapore (and I live here), drury lane wins the race hands down. Their chicken sandwich and their cauliflower pasta is also very nice.

Average brunch cafe...The food was good and delicious however the atmosphere was warm especially after 1pm.

I came here just over a year ago with a friend visiting Singapore for a few hours for a cup of coffee. I was intrigued by the decor of the cafe and it's bright red doors and decided to give it a go. I ordered one of their signatures: Creamy Salted Egg Yolk Hollandaise Sauce on Poached Eggs, SautÃ©ed Prawns & Steamed White Buns. I thought it was an interesting and modern take on the usual Eggs Benedict, especially since I love salted egg yolk.I thought I'd try it again and returned to the cafe in October 2017, but it was unfortunately a let down. The mantao this time was an off-mix of very dry, yet drenched in water. I'm not sure what happened in the kitchen but it may have been an old batch of mantao that was re-steamed for service. The prawns were fresh but there was only two small ones on each mantao - mind you this dish was priced a SGD17.00 per plate. Perhaps I expected more punch to it. The sauce was delightful and fluffy but I will have to rate it 3/5 for the rest of the ingredients did not meet my (hungry) expectations.The service was overall slow even though there were not many other patrons dining. A warm welcome was lacking as well as any form of fond farewell. Every interaction I received seemed transactional as though I was just there to sit, eat and go. I hope it gets better overtime
3
We stopped by for a coffee but were greeted by a grumpy staff member who not only showed us how unhappy she is we entered but also if I asked if there's a place for two she said: it's self service. Not sure what this meant but definitely wasn't pleasant. Overall, coffee was good and muffins as well but the staff was not very nice
2
Went this morning and ordered the salted eggs Ben, berries pancake and breakfast waffles. It's is honestly not worth the money that we paid. The salted eggs ben was watery and lacked the salted egg yolk taste. The mushrooms didn't go well with the waffles. Pancakes were ordinary. The whole family felt disappointed
3
Tried their salted egg yolks egg benedict with grill prawn and cold brew coffee. I have to say that their grill prawns were really fresh. But the salted egg yolk was a tad disappointing. It didn't actually taste like salted egg yolk when there's a mixture of seafood taste.However, their cold brew was fairly up to standard for me: and my bf's soy latte was pretty good too!
4
Came here for breakfast because it seemed reasonably priced and it was. Food was nice and food value. It seems like a local hot spot but a definite must to check out it. We will be back there tomorrow for a very reasonably priced meal.
4
Came here today to try the brunch offerings. Surprisingly popular on a Sunday morning, but service was still efficient and friendly with reasonable prices. My smoked salmon and egg mix was very good. Only criticism is that they don't seem to offer pork products here.
5
We love this place! Go there regularly for breakfast and are extremely happy to have found it! Everyone working there is very friendly and fast. The place itself, especially upstairs is nice and cute.Like the Rosti and the Eggs Benedict as well as the Croissants and the chocolate tarts a lot!! Need to try other things but we always end up ordering the same because it is so delicious :-
5
We visit this cafe on a regular basis. It's set over a couple of floors in a lovely Tanjong Pagar shophouse and the dÃ©cor is nice and simple. Coffee is excellent and we like that they often have different types on offer. Brunches are standard Singapore prices, but the steak sandwich for $8 is a steal! So juicy and tasty and one of the main reasons we keep coming back!Staff are friendly and seem genuinely passionate about coffee (measuring amounts out exactly and lovely latte art). If you like your coffee shops to have a bit of character instead of a pristine Starbucks type shop, definitely check this one out
3
Visited this cafe with friends a couple of days ago. I ordered the salmon and mushroom pasta which although as decent and had a good price ($15), the portion was small and it wasn't anything amazing. However I did get the kaya muffin which interesting enough is 'pay as you wish', it tasted great and I'd definitely recommend it. Overall the cafe itself is nice and cosy but I would advise coming here for desserts or tea instead of a main meal
4
Headed here to do some work on my laptop after my shift in the CBD. This place has wifi and sockets for your charger which makes it a perfect spot to get work done on the big tables. The music is chill and the atmosphere is very laid-back for a super casual environment.I ate a kaya muffin while I was here. They provide you with free water with your snack! Recommend
5
I just love the laid-back chill vibe that this cafe has compared to other great study or hipster cafes with great Wi-Fi like Panopolis or The Loft Cafe just to name a few. Tucked away among a sea of small shophouses in Tanjong Pagar Road, it seems like a perfect hideaway spot for one of Singapore's best kept secrets.The food is above-average, love their salted egg benedict's though, that one is amazing. I always go there to get some work done on or catch-up on my fav TV shows on my lappy or just unwind, sit back with a hot or cold beverage.Overall, Drury Lane has slowly become my number one go-to place cafe in SG. Love it. Especially their wi-fi connectivity, oh my God. <3 
5
A friend recommended the rosti with herbed eggs and avocado and it was the *best*. Coffee was also really good. The menu had a great selection of breakfast/brunch items and the upstairs section in particular had a very chill vibe. Good for catching up with a friend, or in my case, a leisurely solo breakfast. Great spot on a road full of appealing cafes
4
They make perfect coffee here. Staff all very nice and the place is not fancy but great to hang out for a bit and answer couple of emails if you are travelling but still need to check on your work email for an hour or two cause they have good wifi.

I have spent several years working in and out and around of the Tanjong Pagar/Duxton area before the hipster coffee culture started seeping in. Not too long ago, one would have to just deal with the fact that artisanal coffee would never be part of the Tanjong Pagar scene.Currently, the area is fairly competitive, and there's a healthy choice of options, but Drury Lane is probably one of the default coffee joints for me.The good is the coffee. I'm not certain who their roasters are but the internet suggest that they get their beans from Toby's Estate. Some other sources suggest that they experiment with English roaster Square Mile. But that's besides the point! The coffee is great! Some people suggest that the coffee comes in fairly small servings, but this isn't Starbucks where your coffee is over-sized, diluted and saccharinated. This is good coffee, with the craft taken into account.The other good are their cinnamon pastries. I admit my bias because I love everything with cinnamon. Their cinnamon swirls with salted caramel spell comfort food for me. The warmth of the melted sugary paste, and the soft bun dusted in cinnamon, can make me forget about any pre-existing diet I might have.The bad? Foodwise they were adequate to good. Admittedly, I rarely come by here for an actual meal considering that there are cheap eats all over Tanjong Pagar Road/Maxwell. The eggs benedict on toast was slightly on the small size and I've had better eggs benedict elsewhere. However, they were still well-made and if I can't make it home, there's some value there. In terms of western brunches, there are more restaurants in the area that are better at that.It's worth mentioning that the muffins are pay-as-you-wish. The muffins will be a real treat for the sweet-tooth because a lot of effort has gone into the muffins (peanut butter, kaya, nutella, matcha) and they're not simple muffins. It's not a system of dropping spare coins in a tin. You have to ask the servers to pull them out of the display case and then you pay what you feel like direct to the cashier. Overall, I continue to come back here for my cup of joe and the occasional sweet fix, but I'd think twice about actually dining here
4
I really like the coffee in this place. The cappuccinos are fairly small in size, but care and attention is given to the coffee art and the temperature is hot, not luke warm like so many other places. I'll be back for more.
5
Came here for brunch which was wonderful - they had food which is different from the normal eggs benedict. We had baked eggs with various items. At 9am, we could even have linguine pasta. chai latte was good The only issue is that the chairs are a bit uncomfortable as they are hard stools - only one sofa - so not as suitable as a lounging sort of place
3
The coffee here is perfect and while it comes in rather tiny cups, each sip of the coffee is truly good and very impressive. I had the White coffee (their equivalent to a Flat White/Latte), and it ranks very highly as one of the best cuppas in Singapore. Unfortunately, everything else is rather average, and needs a little tolerance from any visitors who are heading in for the coffee. The ambience is actually quite nice - more like a retro shop house, which has not undergone much renovation but it still is quite good. But, we were seated upstairs and it was quite stuffy, and even though it was early in the morning, it really needed some air conditioning, which was physically there but not turned on. The fan was a very small stand fan, which was way under powered for such a large space.Food was average, not exactly cheap, but ok. The service however needs work - the staff are exuding some really grouchy aura. Responses are curt, and not particularly friendly.Lots of potential as a great coffee house, but in the mean time, head there strictly for your cuppa and ignore everything else
4
We went to this place today for coffees. X2 Flat White were very good in terms of taste, aroma, acidity, body and aftertaste. The temperature was right. It was a joyful cups. Citron brioche slides was good.. It would be better if have a jam to put on though. All gentlemen staffs were friendly and quite attentive. This place set price as Nett. It was No Service Charge or GST add.. It's made the price quite cheap for Singapore standard.
3
Walked in and was warmly greeted & invited to seating upstairs. The setting was pleasant though it appeared that cost was a factor in doing up the place.But I was here for brunch not the interior decor. The food was nice though it could be improved upon. The rosti was somewhat burnt and the plating for my other order was uninspired. What made it a good brunch was the filtered coffee; the reason why I may return
2
We've been here twice now, and both times we were impressed by the food and coffee (they're both really good!) but felt let down by the service.Placing your order at the counter the staff are distant and uninterested, and that pretty much sums up the entire service experience. We placed an initial order for some food and coffee, and asked for some ice water also. There were 3 of us, and we received 2 coffees in about 5 minutes, and the third 15 minutes later when the food arrived! In addition, the ice water wasn't brought until after the food and only after prompting. We then ordered some more coffees and some pastries from their display. There was no coffee being made at the time, so we figured it wouldn't take long seeing as the staff didn't seem busy. Somehow they didn't get around to making the coffees for 20 minutes, and then brought us the wrong pastries...I have no idea what their process flow is, but it doesn't work and I think the staff would rather be anywhere but there. It's a real shame to be let down by that, and I'm not sure I've ever felt such frustration in a restaurant, as the food and coffee are excellent
4
Loved this little place tucked away in Tanjong Pagar. We ordered the savoury French toast and salted egg yolk eggs benedict, both of which were really good. The eggs were poached to perfection! Also loved the mixed berries smoothie which was very refreshing on a hot afternoon
3
Ordered the salted egg yolk sauce egg benedict with prawns - felt that it was overpriced at $17 and am unsure why they want to leave the tail of the prawns intact (quite succulent). The sandwich that my partner ordered was however reasonably priced at $5. Took the coffee tasting set at $7 with a small cup of espresso, a regular sized coffee of your choice and a small cup of water. Espresso in my opinion is not thick enough. Ambience wise I find is not at all impressive and the tables and chairs are pretty dirty considering that we are the 1st customers
3
At 9 on a Sunday morning, this is the only place opened. It smelt alcohol; I wondered if it was a pub the previous night. Tiolet is dirty (only one); the floors could be scrubbed better. Still they have decent coffee and sandwiches. When you are hungry and no other places available, any food is God-sent. The coffee had a fantastic aroma. Servers were friendly.
2
Came here for a coffee and banana bread, both of which were good and decently priced. But i was so grossed out by the cleanliness of the place that i was completely put off by my entire experience. The cafe was very warm which made the experience very uncomfortable- huge ventilation and air conditioning issues, especially coming from the open kitchen. I sat upstairs and i felt everything around me was just plain dirty. The aircon, tables and floors looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months. Unacceptable for an outlet serving food and beverage. The people managing this place need to take more care of this cafe. Such a shame.
4
Lots of good breakfast options, good coffee. Serves western style food. Service is efficient. Only pepper and salt are missing on the tables.
3
- a typical local shophouse cafe: young staff, wood furniture, average service
- seating available upstairs
- coffre is decent, food quality and presentation can be better.
3
The food is average and not what I expected it to be. However, the coffee is not bad as it does not have the strong after taste which will linger in your mouth for so long.
2
Went for brunch with some friends on a Sunday morning and was quite disappointed with the food and service. We placed our order at 1120 and my food came at 1215. The staff seemed confused at times and even lost when they were serving customers. Food was very ordinary and not a very child friendly place either with the seating situation unfortunately.
2
Very cool place with mostly students. 2nd floor air-conditioned, first is not. Food was good, but nothing to write home about except the Salmon dish (Brioche, poached egg, salmon, etc) that was good.Greek Yogurt dish (breakfast, $8) was very small and very disappointing. Yogurt is not Greek. Service is very basic by definition.I would go again for the coffee and the place, but unlikely to go especially for breakfast.For that price (not very high, don't get me wrong) you can get a lot more in Singapore.
2
We were at Drury Lane for a work lunch. The place looks cozy and comfy, the menu looks quite interesting too. The food though was a letdown. We ordered various things including the Kale Salad (super tiny portion with barely a tablespoon of quinoa), 1/2 grilled sandwich (Mushrooms, Avocado, Cheddar - very ordinary), Cauliflower Pesto Pasta (barely any salt or flavour), Rosti (passable), and a couple of tarts for dessert. The drinks were the best part of the meal - freshly squeezed juices and coffee
4
The staff were friendly and smiley. The place looked a little old but still bearable if you are not too picky.Food wise, I tried the Linguine with Cauliflower Pesto and Avocado. It tasted refreshing and not too salty. The portion seemed a little small though. Went back on a separate occasion and ordered the Grilled prawns Tom Yum Pasta. It was really tasty. Would recommend this dish
4
Food here is reasonably priced and pretty good value. The atmosphere is casual and young, without being pretentious. Staff were cheerful and polite. I had the eggs Benedict which was delicious. Eggs were done just right. My friend had the yoghurt with muesli, which looked good too. I then tried the kaya muffin (for the muffins, you pay what you think the value should be) which was also quite decent. Hope to come back soon
1
First of all, the place is dirty. The cushions are old and dirty. There's a self service water counter where you can get your own water. I saw stain on the cups so I didn't serve myself with it. I read many good reviews about their Eggs ben with prawn and salted egg hollandaise sauce but it was nothing as good as those reviews bragged about. Disappointed.
4
Went to the Drury Lane CafÃ© with a friend for brunch.The Egg Benedict were really tasty, the mocha smooth, delicious yet a bit small for my style. ;-)The juices come freshly squeezed in trendy jars.Great atmosphere, not too crowded on this Sunday and picturesque housing
5
Grab a Coffee here and hid in its second level dining area, find a corner and get going with your reading, meet ups or just relaxing while you recharge your body.
The coffee is excellent, food is relatively good and best of all, no GST!
5
I'm coming here every week for my sanity time out of the office :) Very quiet and good coffee. The music in the background is perfect. Highly recommended!
4
We came here for a coffee after eating lunch at a nearby restaurant today. A cappuccino, a macchiato and a small chocolate tart for $12, so the prices weren't too bad. Also went to the effort to do a tree design in my cappuccino which made it a little more aesthetically pleasing. Tasted pretty good too
3
The cafe locates in the middle of Tanjong Pagar road which is quite easy to find. The coffee and the grilled cheese sandwich were okay but the seats are limited and i would say not so comfortable so I stay there only for an hour to rest up and move on
3
The café was pretty easy to find. Just take exit A from Tanjong Pagar Station, then walk towards Tras Street and you will find Tanjong Pagar Road, where you will then walk past a whole row of shophouses to unit #94.The café looks rather small when you first enter on the first floor, but becomes much cozier and spacious if you go up to the second floor. The staff members are not that friendly and seem to only notice your presence when you are at the counter ordering food.The food prices are actually rather cheap, compared to other cafés in Singapore. We ordered a Smoked Salmon and Mushrooms Sandwich and an Eggs Benedict. Although we were there rather early, it was rather disappointing to hear that they did not have bacon for the Eggs Benedict and they suggested replacing it with smoked salmon.The Smoked Salmon and Mushrooms Sandwich and the Eggs Benedict were not bad, although there could be more flavours and it would have been nice if the portions were bigger. However, for this value, the food was really quite worth it. I would say that this place is definitely worth a visit, and then you can decide for yourself if you want to make a second trip here again

Nestled along the very busy Tanjong Pagar road, this cozy café is definitely a buck the trend type, among the never ending Korean BBQ restaurants. They serve all-day breakfast along with a selection of delicious coffees and teas. The all-day breakfast selection includes baked eggs, eggs benedict, the usual breakfast platters that include eggs of your choice along with mushrooms, home-made baked beans, sausages and toasts. We ordered, 94 go green platter, potatoes and leek baked eggs, cappuccino, hot chocolate, banana bread with espresso butter and chocolate tart. The breakfast platter came with sautéed mushrooms, baked beans, sliced avocado, toasted bread and my choice of egg. The mushroom was excellent and the home-made baked beans was impressive too. The scrambled egg was rich and creamy. The baked eggs was really sumptuous. The potatoes were crunchy, the eggs and tomatoes were well cooked. The cappuccino and hot chocolate were excellent too. The banana cake and chocolate tart were spectacular! Overall the food was fantastic! Definitely one of the top brunch place in Singapore. Hands down! Keep up the good work.
4
The negative first: the staff aren't very friendly and more concerned about getting orders than service.Positives: reasonably priced. Cheaper than a lot of other cafes for the same food. We had the eggs benedict n the baked egg with bacon. Both are nice.Atmosphere reminds me of Camden Market in London
2
Nice, quaint little place... i meant the decor. The upstairs has more cozy setting, the tables were well-spaced. Some of the chairs were made of stacked wine crates and a little cushion...The generator died twice when I was there, so we had a unique experience of eating in the dark with no ventilation. Waited for 45min for our orders which had 8 orders in front of us, only to receive a burnt waffle. I was not very impressed with my Steak and Cheese sandwich.The only saving grace was the coffee and the banana bread with espresso butter. YUMS! We had 1 there and I ordered 2 to go. :)My personal opinion : I didn't like the food at all and would not visit there again.By the way, I think the seating is better downstairs than upstairs cos it's brighter and you wouldn't see young couples cuddling on the couch in desperate need of a room

drury lane is where the muffin man lives, according to the nursery rhyme. and it did seem like this cafe wanted to make its muffins the highlight, since they are served on a pay-as-you-wish basis. but also perhaps because of this concept, it suggests for patrons to not expect too much, which unfortunately i did and was sorely disappointed. the muffins (i tried the nutella, matcha and banana walnut) were all too tough and doughy with insufficient flavour. not sure if i would want to return and take risks with its other pastries.also ordered the potato leek baked eggs which was good but probably only because it's nearly impossible to go wrong with combining chunks of potato and pieces of leek with cheese, eggs and tomato baked beans. thankfully the baked beans wasn't the average out-of-a-can kind
3
Came here for breakfast, good coffee, eggs benedict with turkey bacon was good. Wife had the veggie eggs but was charged an extra dollar to poach them, srlsy? We sat at the front window table, the table was filthy and the window itself disgustingly dirty. Overall good food, dirty venue
