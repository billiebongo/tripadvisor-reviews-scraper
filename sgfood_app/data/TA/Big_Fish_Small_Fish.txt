The served really awesome food. I love the chips with the yellow sauce. It's simply awesome and good to go with a beer!

Loved the fish and chips. The chips are criss-cut potato chips that come with a fried and battered filet of whichever fish you choose.

Came here for lunch and it was quite quiet. Many sauces were available and the chips were unique and nice. Abit like potato chips but fresher! Fish was decent but portion was relatively small, so not so value for money.

Passby a few times and today finally we are here to try out their fish chips. What's so nice here? Easy to locate and the place is bright. The food, nah... too oily. We ordered Salmon Rice ($12.90), Tilapia Fish & Chips ($8.90). When my food arrive, I can't see my tilapia as it was covered up by those chips. The chips were not crispy and seems to have "lao hong". Overall, food is very oily

Nothing out of the ordinary here, apart from their presentation. The fish tasted very underwhelming, the batter was crispy and all but the fish itself tasted barely cooked. Their salted egg sauce is worth the free flow of condiments, but service attitude is terrible. When we inquired at the counter about our order, which was taking rather long, they nonchalantly redirected us to the kitchen staff after we stood there unattended to for a few good minutes. When we checked with the kitchen staff, brushed us off saying we had to check with the counter staff with annoyance in their voices. Average food, but their service attitude deters me from wanting to make a second trip here

I like the concept of the whole place, outdoor and the fact you can buy from other stalls. For the chips, it is different from normal french fries. Love the variety of sauces they provide. Can choose vinegar, tartar sauce, salted egg, chilli, etc. Fish is not great in my opinion. It is okie only. Snapper not bad. Dory sold out the two times i was there. Cod fish wasn't good. Overall nice experience

Yummy!!! Ordered the most basic Dory fish which cost about $7.40. It comes with a lot of chips! However, I find the size of dory quite small. The good thing is they have free flow of sauces: Tomato, Chilli, Cheese, Tartar, Mayo and Salted Egg! :)

The fish and the crisps were simply delicious. I have tried the seabass and red snapper. And having had three times within two weeks shows how good it is. There are a variety of special sauces to go with the crisps and fish but I like the xo sauce best. Definitely my kind of comfort food. Crisps certainly one of the items that got me hooked and keep coming back for more

We visited on a Saturday evening at around 7. Quite crowded but we managed to get a seat without much hassle. Portion of a meal (including fish and chips) is not big so I guess it's "just nice" for a small eater. We tried the XO Shrimps too and it was "ok". Not impressive.

Went there last weekend with wife and children. This is the only restaurant that's had the most crowd. Ordered dory fish and it's comes with potato chips. I must say it's quite delicious. Coupled with a outdoor environment, facing the rivers, it's a good experience. Damage is about $45 for a family of 5. If u visit, make sure u do it at late afternoons, else it'll gonna be very hot
