Spacious high end bar with slow piano music with subtle lighting and ambiance, it's a place where you can take things slow. Housed in Mandarin Oriental Hotel, it's an expensive place to drink, so be aware! if you just want to have a drink and don't care much for surroundings this is not the place for you.The menu is extensive with good mix of all high grade spirits and some good cocktails that we expect in such places - it will not hold any surprises for you - but, if you want to shave a quite time by yourself or a bit of intimate date, this place is for you.Mind you business meetings and short after dinner drinks will also be good here, but large groups might be better off somewhere else

The Axis bar located int the middle of the hotel on the 4th floor.the place is very relaxing with live music , mainly Piano,but the singer was terrific,singing soul and relaxing songs very respected sound.The drinks are great,and the service was excellent. It is perfect for relaxing after dinner with the one you love

As a guest of the Mandarin we visited on our last day.The bar is on the fourth floor of the hotel. Views are out over the marina.The cocktails are superb and our waitresses for both afternoon and evening Blair and Michelle who were fantastic.Firstly the cocktails were amazing. Not the cheapest but the quality and taste weâ€™re outstanding.What stood out for me was the prompt service, the knowledge and overall professionalism from both as well as the rest of the staff.We were served snacks whilst at the bar with views to die for.The service as mentioned was first class and this made the experience all the more worth whilst.Both ladies are a credit to the establishment
5
Overall good experience, nice ambience and service. Booking was made prompt using this app rather than the hassle to call in
5
Excellent quality of food compared to some other places. Selection of high tea is also changing from time to time.
5
Have visited this bar many times and it has always been a good experience. The staff are excellent (as MO staff usually are). There is a very good selection of drinks on the menu and if you require something different the staff will try their best to accommodate you.It is a peaceful place to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area. I can also recommend the afternoon tea which is a delight
5
The lounge, like the hotel, exudes an air of romantic elegance. You get a beautiful view of the Marina Bay area through the floor-to-ceiling windows from the lounge. There is a live performance by a pianist, guitarist, and vocalist from 9.30pm onwards, which adds a lovely touch to the visit. We had the vanilla bourbon ice tea and Strawberry Sunrise mocktail, and both tasted delicious. Service provided was exemplary. The service staff was very friendly and attentive to the guests in the bar, making the visit an even more enjoyable one. I highly recommend this place for your after-dinner drinks at the end of the day
5
The view from axis bar lounge is so good! and I love the wide selection of teas. They serve up a good mix of sweet and savoury snacks.

Celebrated my birthday in advance with a group of friends. Many birthday celebrations though, will be good if more coordinated. But overall an awesome experience
5
Great ambience, great service and great staff make this place a 'must visit' section of the Hotel. Thoroughly enjoyable area where you can eat, drink and talk to your heart's content in comfortable, quiet and serene surroundings
5
Went there one evening for a night cap... the next night they knew exactly what I wanted - that is service!

We were there for the high tea session. Food, service and ambience was great. The high tea selection was massive - Both my friend and I found it very hard to finish the food as it was just too much. For big eaters however, I think you will enjoy it! I'm not sure why Axis Bar and Lounge chose to hire foreigners, mostly seem to be koreans, as they are unfamiliar with some of the local fusion desserts that was on the menu. And because of the extensive menu as well, it was hard for them to memorise the entire selection. For a few parts, they were either unsure which pastry was what, or what was the full name of the dessert. My friend called to tell them that it was a birthday celebration and they handled it very quickly and even had a surprise birthday cake! The lapse in service is easily forgivable as the general service was really good and the food was great as well
5
It's a great place to go to if you want to have an aperitif before having dinner to enjoy the view of the skyline. The service here is also quite commendable
5
My friend and I had a great tea time in Axis. If you are looking for the best high tea in Singapore, Axis is MUST-TRY place. The Foie Grass Tart with Fig was my favorite savoury and my friend really liked their fig scones. Not only food, but also staffs in Axis are VERY friendly and nice especially two Korean ladies(Claire and I don't rememeber the other name) who served our table. Definitely will come back
5
Sit back and relax with an 18 piece afternoon tea.....professional and friendly staff, piano musician with a view
5
Great place for a drink or two with friends. We will be coming back!G&T were tasty, and so was the dessert wine. Friendly, attentive staff and great view
5
My wife and I had an excellent afternoon tea experience this afternoon. Very comfortable setting, wonderful selection of teas, great food and great service. Very impressed with their ability to provide gluten free option for someone with celiac disease

We had a very unpleasant experience of racial discrimination in MO Singapore. We visited Axis Bar for afternoon tea on 13 August. Early on, we were greeted with a choice of seats. We also appreciated the little bday cake surprise. However, food and drinks went downhill compared to the last visit, yet those shortfalls were nothing as compared to staff terrible attitudes. First and the minor ones, the waitresses first attended to us gave us wrong info for choices of drink. As we doubted she said she would get us back to us after further checking, but she never did. In short, there were a lot of careless handling of plates and tea pot. And all the attendants kept on skipping the food shown on the menu but jumped to serve us the last one - the 3-tier desserts, even though we had already reminded the staff twice. And the most unbearable incidence happened since then. The staff called Julia and Ameya started by turning their utmost greetings and attentions toward the Caucasian guests who all arrived later. Actually they were coming individually only for drinks and snacks, but were offered with a full plate of nibbles & pastries from our tea set for free. Each Caucasian guest received double portions of nibbles. Heard that one of the guest said that was too much for him. The free food were not only given to one Caucasian's table, but all of their tables on our left and right sides. That's why we could hear them very clear. Whereas the only Asian couple behind us were not offered the same food, not even a single complimentary item. It was quite obvious. Certainly, it is the hotel's option and their staffs to treat their dining guests differently, but this is an act of unfair prejudice to other guests. After all, the food we paid for was actually free to other guests generously at the same time. To our surprise, the staff were clearly trained to serve Caucasians with a different level of services and constantly checked on their needs right next to us, whereas we were such unimportant in their eyes that they never come to check on our needs even it's just one step away. Julia refilled hot water to other "afternoon tea" guests, but she didn't attend to us in her round. After 20+mins of waiting, I requested Ameya to assist with refilling the hot water to teapots, but his answered was absolutely unbelievable and unprofessional. Ameya refused to do so, he told us that we should not be services beyond 5pm, as the tea time was over. I insisted as all we needed was simply some water to refill the teapots to balance out the delayed-serving desserts. Then, after 30secs Julia came to refill and poured the hot water all over our table and onto the floor. Although she knew some hot water was pouring onto the floor and almost on my feet, she still didn't stop it. She seemed to be in a big hurry to finish us off. She even knocked down our paper menu onto the floor. She had NO sorry, NO word, NO eye contact and NO facial expression. Horrible! She was ridiculously impatient with us, as if we should leave the Bar immediately!Finally, we concluded this kind of treatment was completely unfair. As we paid our bill and left, we found out that many other Caucasian guests on the other side of the bar were still enjoying their late afternoon tea tier and served beyond the so-called "tea servicing hours". Caucasian privilege

The Axis Bar and Lounge at the Mandarin Oriental at Marina Square offers a contemporary and casual atmosphere for cocktails or drinks at the end of a busy day or before evening dinner.The menu of unique cocktails combine flavors and spice of Asian mixology, to provide refreshing, new taste combinations to the ingredients of traditional cocktails.The ambiance is open and colorful with large glass windows which provide natural light to light your spirits and adjust your attitude. The service is attentive and helpful, and not pretentious, which is the perfect combination at the end of a busy work day
3
The view is good, but the location is really really really difficult to find, it's easy to be confused with Marina mandarine hotel, I have spent 0.5 hour to find the place because i went to the wrong hotel.
5
Went there late in the evening after a sightseeing day. The staff was really friendly and polite. They knew that we had honeymoon and offered us cake and drinks for free. We spent a lovely evening in this luxury bar. Thank you MO
5
The menu which states the durian dessert does not taste like real durian fruits, rather it taste like durian cake and syrup or powder
3
Food pricey yet small and petite at pricing of $80 for 2 pax. Guess just want ppl to feel less guilty. It would be better comes in 3 to 4 tiers display food rack than clearing coz quite irritating. Checked on high tea menu before i booked the table but it was not as the correct menu when i was served. A bit disappointed
5
Can recommend the Mandarin Sling cocktail and the Strawberry Sunrise mocktail. Food is very good , staff excellent
4
We booked high tea for 3.30pm to while away the afternoon until we were ready for our ride to the airport. It was a pleasant way to enjoy the rest of the time in the hotel
3
Visited axis bar for high tea on Sunday. We are on the second sewing, starting at 3pm.There are guest who were early, and you will be asked to wait (no issue with that, however, this should be made clear to customers when reservations are made).The high tea bar is not open till 3.08pm and the service staff did not proactively approach the already waiting customers to take their names and lead them to the table. Instead, customs have to walk forward again, asking for table. When seated, the food - totally delicious! With great tea selection! We stayed for a Long time, till after 5pm and the service staff passed us the bill - without asking us if we need the bill or if we are ready to pay. For a 6 star hotel, this is really disappointing. Again, the resturant needs to learn to manage customer expectations. Having said that, the overall experience is still very enjoyable with very very delicious food Looking forward to an improved service as I will be visiting it again for the food!With regardsAudrey

My wife and I booked in for High Tea at Axis Bar and Lounge and really enjoyed the offering. We have taken high tea at many hotels over the years and while this was not the best we have had, from a value for money point of view it was right up there. There were lots of tasty morsels, all well explain by our server and overall they were really good. While this is not the most highly rated 'High Tea' in Singapore we very much enjoyed it and would certainly recommend it to others
4
The high tea set is worthy and service is satisfactory. The desserts and snacks (especially cakes) are savory but scone is so so. Overall speaking, it is recommended
4
I'm not the "hotel bar" kind of person, but since I was with colleagues and we didn't want to walk around anymore after long days (business trip) we decided to just head down here.Cocktails were decent, service was excellent from the wait staff, and the beer was cold. Nothing much to ask for - except maybe not have the drinks cost triple. Then again, it's inside a hotel, so that's that
5
The high tea experience was great. Nice atmosphere with love piano performance. Love the ambience and service. Food was great! Love the whole experience
5
Axis bar is a great place to enjoy Cocktails, snacks and lighter meals… the Club sandwich is amazing!
4
A good meeting place and somewhere you can unwind Good views of the financial district in the evening and good service with a background of live musicGood place to just sit and reflect on the da
5
Speakeasy bar with Smooth live Jazz and most of all.. Good Drinks! :) It was an awesome experience for me and my wife
5
I am a regular at Axis Bar and Lounge for their weekend Afternoon Tea. It is such a beautiful and classy place yet, the price for 2 pax won't burn a hole in your pocket. $80++ for 2 pax. If you have a UOB or other bank cards or The Dining Society card (issued by the Mandarin Oriental Singapore), you will enjoy a 15% discount. The Afternoon Tea menu changes monthly so you'll never be bored.One of the best places for Afternoon Tea on a lazy Saturday or Sunday afternoon!P.S. Ask for a table overlooking Marina Bay
5
 We had a wonderful high tea at the Axis Bar, presented beautifully and very tasty. The desserts were little works of art. My husband loved the varieties of teas to choose from. The staff were attentive, and gave us time between courses to have a rest, which we appreciated. We had a nice table by the window so had a good view as well. A lovely relaxing Sunday afternoon had. Would definately recommend
5
Just after dinner (eating too much) I hang out a bit before taking a cab back to my hotel. Enjoyed here a nice place, hanging out, looking at Singapore's Skyline at night.Nice bar music, cosy atmosphere, and let time passing by...I love such places in the evening
5
This bar is by far the best i have ever been in. The incredible staff are very welcoming and always remember your name and your drink. The atmosphere is excellent and the bar has wonderful views of Marina Bay due to the lovely floor to ceiling windows. Ameya, Eileen and Claire are exceptional staff who made our visits so very special.
4
Generally good, however the food spread consist of too much sweet pastries. Sofa seating is too close to one another, no privacy.
5
Kudos to Junel the Manager of Axis Bar! Very accomodating and friendly always giving service with a smile! The Management of Mandarin Oriental should give credits to this top guy as he is an asset to the company! Good job! will be back again! Nice tea and cocktails
4
We made the last minute booking for afternoon tea. Upon arrival, we felt a bit unwelcoming by the staff (Amaya?) who assigned the seat but then later we well served by Junel and esp Michelle who was attentive during the meal. MBS harbour view as always, food was tasty and plenty with two choices of drinks for each person. Recommended
5
Lovely food, different from the usual afternoon tea. Lovely experience, must try for every hotel guest
2
I booked the high tea on boxing day at the last minute because its the only place with available seats and I finally understood why. It was for celebration for a friend who was getting married so we were all quite excited but this high tea was really a downer. First of all, the plating was ugly if you compare it with other hotels serving high tea. The scones were hard and cold, even coffee bean scones were much much nicer. The puff pastries came cold and we waited a long time for them cos they said the kitchen was baking them so we expected them to be hot but it wasn't. We didn't bother asking them to replace anything cos we waited for so long we were already rushing for time for our next activity. The desserts were just sweet and sweeter. All in all, there wasn't an item worth mentioning, the best thing would probably be the tea. If you intend to spend $60 on high tea, just go somewhere else, trust me. We left feeling unsatisfied, unhappy and still hungry
4
I was staying at the Mandarin Oriental recently, and this of course is their in the house bar.The bar has a good selection of drinks, and has a nice relaxed setting. There are comfortable chairs and also sofas. There is a view towards the Esplanade but one can see little of the Marina Bay because of the buildings nearby.Good for a relaxing drink or a nightcap. Coffee and tea also available at the bar. I was in a wheelchair whilst at the hotel having just come out of hospital, and the staff were so helpful in that respect.The bar also does a high tea selection although I personally have not indulged
4
We booked this for high tea. Excellent service from Junel and his team. Everything was beautifully presented and good TWG tea selection. The best courses were the 1st 2 with savories, scones and puffs. The latter 2 were mainly sweet desserts and the last course we found a little too sweet except for the day chocolate and red-currant cream which was not too sweet & tasted great. Only item we did not like was the mini fruit cake which was rather dry
4
went there on Sunday and tried afternoon tea for lunch. the volume of afternoon tea is not so big but good for standard Asian people, I think.Moreover the best point is not so crowded and bigger personal space as well as windows table with sofa. Recommend for those matured who do not like packed afternoon tea
4
The usual suspects- scones, sandwiches are all there and delicious, and as halloween was approaching at the time, it has added this theme in some of its pastries. Still manage to taste good and not as scary as it looks(for example, the "Tombs" were actually chocolate cakes). Nice try though I would prefer "normal ones". I prefer the savory ones than the sweet ones though. They actually taste more refreshing.Nice tea from, what else, TWG as well. The service met my expectation although it could be really crowded at times
4
Enjoyed this afternoon high tea with a halloween twist. Really creative! Great selection of tea. Love the course by course serving of the savouries followed by the tiered desserts
4
Visited Axis last weekend to try out afternoon tea. Generally the service was very good as was the food quality. Not what I would describe as a traditional English afternoon tea but nice and well prepared. We had a window seat which was nice although the view is not amazing. Our only criticism was the piano. Although an accomplished player and a nice selection of tunes it was a little too loud to be comfortable and made it difficult to have a conversation. Total cost for 2 was just under $100 so also not the cheapest tea but nice nevertheless.
5
This bar is outstanding. The staff are friendly and helpful, making you feel that you are the most important people there. Thanks to Rebecca and the boys during the day. Excellent variety of drinks, yummy food snack selection and outstanding views. A highlight for us.
5
Lovely deserts and great drinks . I enjoyed the view and they helped me celebrate my birthday. I had a lovely view and enjoyed the ambience without having to go far
3
Went here the other evening with a small group because Morton's bar was full. Axis is a casual lounge with a nice view of Marina Bay so especially good around sunset.
Staff here was very attentive and friendly.
5
We always go to Axis Before our show at Esplanade. I enjoy sitting there watching Singapore skyline in sunset. It's magical. Service is great, it's Mandarin Oriental standard after all, very friendly and attentive staff, they are very friendly with children too.
5
I visited Axis twice during my stay at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in August 2016. Both times I was greeted by name and received superb service there from all the staff. They do an excellent range of local and international cocktails. They also do an excellent range of bar snacks and non alcoholic drinks. I can heartily recommend the Molecular Peach Bellini, the flight of 3 local cocktails, the non alcoholic lychee and mint cocktail, the Wagyu sliders, the crab cakes and the assorted satay. All delicious and served by attentive staff in a lovely environment, which had just the right lighting for night time (not too dark, not too bright). I didn't go to Axis during the day, but I suspect that it may be rather dark during the day because most of the rest of the communal areas of the hotel are quite dark during the day unless they are outside or have extensive lighting (like Melt)
5
In this day and age, it is extremely difficult to find a truly CIVILISED place to have a drink in a city, as almost every bar finds it necessary to bombard you with loud music, TV-screens and such.The Axis Bar at the Mandarin Oriental, Singapore, is a stunning exception.To begin with, its decor of understated luxury and comfortable lounge-chairs creates an immediately inviting ambience. Then, there are the soft strains of a jazz trio, assisted by a singer, performing well-known "standards" rather than generic, beat-heavy muzak.And the Manhattans we ordered were PERFECT. Well-chilled and correctly made, with the right proportion of ingredients, garnished with a Maraschino cherry.Speaking of which, the "cherry on the cake" was the superb service. Attentive, courteous, efficient.And with a lovely view of the Singapore skyline.What more could one ask? That there were MORE places like this in the world
5
The 'Mandarin Oriental' brand name itself is like a guarantee of the food quality, and indeed the afternoon tea experience here was pretty nice! The food was decent, the environment was comfy and elegant with live music! Will definitely come back for more
4
I went to this place for afternoon tea at 3 pmThe place look dark and gloomy.Items were served one by one. First - berry cream, then hot items A, hot items B, then scones, mini puff, and then 3 tier stand of sweet cake and pastries. Come with a pot of tea,.It is good place to have light meal and drink , then skipped dinner.
5
Fabulous place to enjoy an after dinner drink with great views over the bay. Also if you are not too hungry it is perfect for a light bite as the bar snacks are delicious. The staff are very attentive and are happy to give you advice on the best places to visit in a Singapore
5
This bar is in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. The lounges are spacious, and set wide apart, so you're not jammed in with other guests. The manager, Bob, is a great example of all the staff in the hotel, keeping his guests well-informed of tourist spots, and serving wonderful drinks and food
4
The Mandarin Oriental has an excellent selection of restaurants and where better to sit afterwards and enjoy a drink or a nice cup of coffee but the Axis Bar. Great views at night. Good ambiance and friendly service. What more could you want before or after your meal!! Good wifi connections.
3
If you are planning to have a reasonably priced high tea with a view and good surrounding, Axis Bar & Lounge in Mandarin Oriental is not too bad.The seating are nicely spaced out with a view over looking the Marina Bay. The servers are very polite and pleasant. Best of all, it is served not on a buffet line.You get a great choice of TCC choice tea to choose from. If you're someone who has a sweet tooth, the dessert will suit you fine. However, for me I find the spread lacks variety and does not offer an exciting experience of other flavor that could have been part of the spread.All in all still a great place to chill from the hot afternoon sun and to catch up with a friend or loved one over a cuppa
5
Excellent service, great atmosphere. Wide selection of drinks. World travelers abound for interesting conversation. Snacks and food menus also available.
5
The quality of food is good so is the service. I recommend a weekend high tea here which overlooks the city landscape although it's located at lvl 4 or 5. The ambience is quiet and the seating is not too close to each other
4
This is a nice place and relaxing. They do have music going. Suitable for business Because the chairs are broad and suitably far apart but it can get a little dark.
4
Loved everything -- 18 different things in 5 courses. Tough to choose from the TWG tea menu. Check the menu posted on the Web site. I think they change it every month.
4
Another restaurant in the Mandarin Oriental on Raffles Avenue. Freshly made omelette is great. Evening drinks are served looking out over the bay.
4
We went there for snacks after our meeting/seminar. They offer a wide range of drinks alcohols, juices, softdrinks and water. Their prawn cake is delicious as well as the shanghai made of prawn.
4
I've been here a few times for afternoon tea and it's definitely not the traditional British high tea. The food is more fusion and comes with 5 courses. It uses Asian flavors to has a theme each month so menu changes. I was not a fan of the Halloween theme but the first time I went in September, really enjoyed the menu (can't remember the theme). This time, it was the Easter theme revolving around egg (either made to look like an egg or with egg as an ingredient). It was ok. The atmosphere is quiet and good for getting together with your girlfriends, family or with your significant other. Good view if you get a table by the window of MBS, Esplanade and CBD. The service was excellent every time so I really enjoy it
4
Platter after platter of canapes, finger sandwiches, pastries and chocolates -- brilliant (and architecturally assembled) and graciously served. Everything was tasty -- the tuna's a standout -- and the service is outstanding. A great way to transition from afternoon to evening -- especially if you're planning on a late dinner
5
The bar is fantastic. Happy hour with lovely lychee cosmopolitans. 3 or 4 of these and you need to call it a night! Continuos free servings of mini steak sandwiches adds to this being the best place in the Mandarin oriental to head to after a busy days work. One place that I will definitely go back to even if I am not staying at this hotel.
3
We went to this place after dinner. Actually our original planned was to go to THE BAR at Morton's. But arrived at 10 p.m. and morton's was already closed. So, this place just opposite. The decorations look nice. We decided to try. My bloody mary was quite weak in flavor and level of alcohol. The mandarins with hendrick was good. The Adam apple taste like a chemical flavor apple. At the beginning after sat down. The waiter came by take order. He had no idea what we talking about and asked us is it on the menu. And of course the answer was Yes. He ran back to check and told us it was OK to order. Plus mess up as repeat the orders same drinks that he ran out to check. C'mon if you can't remember please use notebook and pen. I'm not impressed.
5
Very polite & professional services with a smile. Pay attention to details & a place with great view
5
Axis bar is my all-time favourite bar. Bar offers great view of Singapore city area.
Services are top-notch.
Peaceful and romentic place ...Whenever good friends are coming from oversees, this is the place I would take them to..
5
This unique venue in the centre of Bangkok ofers an unrivalled city views.The staff are really professional especially Toffy and Koong. And all the drink and food are perfect taste.It is a must go place in Bangkok.
5
Kahlia(hope that's spelt correctly) and his staff deliver drinks and service not to be missed,cannot recommend highly enough!
5
The lounge is located on level 4 of the Mandarin Oriental. Views across the river are nice and the atmosphere refined. Much better than some of the other bars I visited. Service was good and prices were reasonable (less than Raffles). Nice place for a quiet drink
5
Have been to Singapore recently. Again, I had a chance to have a drink at Axis Bar and Lounge at the Mandarin Oriental. They had a promotion of different Pinot Noir wine from different parts of the world. The French and the Central Otago, NZ, ones were exceptional.The F&B manager of the Axis Bar, Ms Keren, explained the differences of the wines very comprehensivly. Again, she and her staff created a warm and very welcoming atmosphere of top hospitality. They didn't do just business but their business was and is to create loyal customers.Thank you! Will definitely be back next time in Singapor
5
I had afternoon tea here during my stay at the hotel. As always for Mandarin Oriental, the tea was beautifully presented and a great range of teas to choose from. I often have afternoon tea at the Mandarin in Tokyo, so it was nice to try a different place for a change
5
On a recent holiday to Songapore with my sister and cousin we indulged ourselves with an exquisite afternoon in the Axis Bar at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. I am a coeliac so i make sure when booking to let them know and check that my Gluten Free requirements are understood.On arrival we were seated on a low sofa with stunning views of the water and city .The service was great we were given Tea menus to choose from the dozen or so different blends of Tea or coffee if you prefer.We started with a glass of Champagne.the food when it arrived was both beautiful to look at and exquisite to taste.Small mouthfuls that had the Wow factor..As for my GlutenFree version you could not falt it.In fact people at a neighbouring table wanted to know way they had not received the same food as our table and were miffed at missing out on some of the GlutenFree offering.All together a great way to spend an afternoon away from the bustle of busy Singapore.I would recommend it to everyone
5
One of the nicer afternoon tea we had so far. We came at the 12pm seating and there was hardly anyone. Which meant undivided attention from the staff. We were given great seats facing THE view. Although low raise, but very impressive, overlook the most important buildings in singapore. Quite a good selection of tea, i had the earl grey chocolate tea which tasted exactly like chocolate but yet is a tea. There was frequent top up. We loved the starter which was the refreshing osmanthus flower jelly. It was defintely my husband's favourite. Although i am normally a fan of the traditional high tea, i must say the asian fusion style is creative. They have the usual scones and cakes and desserts but i really liked the variety with egg custard, pie, char siew sau etc. is like dimsum and high tea together. There was balance of savoury and sweets.The scones are also very yummy, esp the choco ones. I also enjoyed the banana cake and the praline puff. Price was also quite decent at $80 per couple before tax. Service was prompt and professional. They even offered to take photos for us. What was missing though was some lounge music. I suspect they would have it at the later seating. Overall we really enjoyed our time and the food and would definitely come back again.
5
My family went there for high tea, and the menu for that month was the SG50 inspired menu. I believe for the month of April it's Cantonese inspired. The food was great, the portion for each item was small but there was a sufficient variety of items to satiate us. Of course there were some misses - the Cantonese egg custard shooter was overly dry and the beef brisket pie was too heavy; but there were plenty of hits too - the octopus was divine, as was the osmanthus jelly, vanilla caramel puff, and mango chocolate. The cocoflake scone was also wonderful, served slightly warm and in small portions, it was enough to fill up our bellies but not too much to make us too full to enjoy the next course of desserts. All in all I thought the food was delicate and expertly made and I really enjoyed my experience there. The ambience was good, though I thought it was slightly dark where I was seated. The window side tables were definitely much brighter, not to mention that you would also get stunning views of the Singapore skyline. This would be a wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion, and I highly recommend that you request for a window seat if you ever choose to visit
5
The lower floor means views are just ok but really made up by excellent service, a High Tea, which seems to be very very popular, and comfortable sink-into and chat seating.
5
Delicious cocktails while enjoying a stunning view. We had a night cap there several times where we were greeted like old friends by the staff who chatted with us about our day.
4
We chose to have a night cup at the MO's Axis Bar and don't regret it: Very good drinks, professional waiters, live music, decent patrons, stylish setting. Will be back!
4
The service at this mezzanine bar of the Mandarin Oriental was spotless and exquisite and the barman was very good in preparing cocktails, especially the Millionaire Mojito!
I strongly recommend for a late night drink!
5
Great views, good food and drink lists.
Extraordinary attentive and friendly management (Ms. Keren) and fellow staff (Ms. Kim)
5
We were looking to end our Singapore Holiday last Friday on a high note and the High Tea at the Axis Bar and Lounge on the Fourth floor Mandarin Oriental certainly ticked all the boxes. The Food, Music and Service were all 6 star!The young female Jazz Pianist was sensational and added so much to the occasion.Check out this link for pictures and words that truly sum it up. http://madamechewy.com/2014/02/28/afternoon-tea-mandarin-orientals-axis-bar-and-lounge/Thank you Mandarin and thank you to your amazing staff and Chefs
4
Afternoon tea very good.if your staying on the club floors you can have after tea in Axis Bar,very English but nice with a good choice.The view is good it overlooks the marina Al you get a view of Sands Hotel, business downtown,which is all light up at night,and you get to see Sands laser 
4
Wonderful high tea on the 4th floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel with views overlooking Marina Bay. The food is served in four courses and each were different and delicious. There are some really unusual teas and there is a champagne option available too. Highly recommended for high tea in classy surroundings with a good view. Make sure you're very hungry as there is a lot to eat

Im not a fan of sweet but high is is pretty exiting and must-do thing among female friends. ;) Me and my friends decided to do high tea b4 X-mas. This was my first thigh tea in Singapore, so I did my research pretty thoroughly. Im looking for a place that satisfies 3 conditions, 1. To have a nice window view 2. To provide good quality/great presentation desert 3.To be accessible. I read ppl's reviews & photos on line and ended up deciding to have high tea here. And I was more than happy with my choice!! The lounge was not too big, not too small, just right to enjoy cozy and lay back afternoon time over tea. It is on level 4 though, it provides nice view as it faces to ocean and most of tables place along the window. What impressed me the most was the organization of the menu. The 5 course high tea menu serves tea with 18 different petite treats! And they are nicely ordered as you can add up the different layers of flavors on your tongue. (Many high tea places usually throw all their treats in one serve and they are very sweet. Unless u Really enjoy sweets you won't be able to finish half of them).No point to talk abt their looks here, u can see how adorable and presentable they are from the photos on the front page. The menu changes monthly, this must be welcoming news for high tea lovers! (They had Christmas special this Month) I will def come back to enjoy my high tea here. And I bet you would enjoy ur time here as I did. All my girl friends were very happy and said they would come every week if they can. Lol

came here after dinner for a few drinks with my daughter,her partner and some friends. This just topped off our already perfect evening.

Relaxing bar with a pleasant singer who sometimes interrupts his song to greet you. Courteous service and a nice offering of bar snacks. Not cheap but it is a hotel bar so to be expected.
5
Great range of drinks and beautiful atmosphere with Piano player and singer. Staff more than helpful and nothing a problem for them to organise for you.

Great service and a view overlooking the Marina Bay. especially good whilst the sun is setting. The Cocktails are fantastic and selection of Wines excellent

Can be used for short business meetings in the day time and a very relaxing place in evening for a drink

Visited the Axis Bar while staying at the Mandrian Oriental. It is expensive but the staff were great and gave us some nice complimentary nibbles and chocolates.

we just wanted to have a seat at the axis bar before dinner at cherry garden but the staff kalai refused to let us enter the bar. if i didnt insist that i will be having dinner at cherry garden he will not give me a place to sit in. this is a five star hotel and i could have a drink while waiting if he just allowed us to sit first. but he said first that this is a bar and you cannot sit if you will not order drinks and foods.. c'mon, this is a lounge. i wanted to check in but because of this terrible staff i will never ever stay in this hotel and go to this bar anymore!!! ps. he let us sit at melts which is a restaurant too. does that mean i can sit at melts without ordering anything but i cant sit at the bar lounge without ordering? so illogical!.. tonight wednesday around 8:20 pm bar is almost empt

Hubby and I went here for High Tea on a rainy day in Singapore. We had our hotel book a table for us which is recommended to avoid disappointment. The hotel itself is not very hard to find but we were a bit lost entering the lobby but managed to find our way to where the bar is situated. We were shown to a small table with views over Marina Bay. We were given a menu with all of the different dishes and also a selection of teas from TWG. I really liked the menu idea as you normally don't get to read about what you eat or drink during some of these sessions. My husband opted for a classic take with the Earl Grey tea and I went for the Kilimanjaro Snow which is infused with Lemon and Tangerine. The tea itself was absolutely lovely, rich in taste but not bitter with a light hint of the infusion. I also opted for one of their more rare teas, the White Night Jasmine tea which is Yin Zhen white tea tips blended with night blooming jasmine and it is one of the most extravagant teas in China. It did come with a surcharge of $15 per pot but I have to say it was really worth it. They changed my tea cup to a clear cup and a clear tea pot and the waiter came and explained the tea to us both which was very appreciated. This was probably one of the best teas I have ever tasted in my life. Absolutely fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone. I had two pots and would have done more if I weren't so full. The food of the High Tea was really lovely. It came out one course at a time so you had time to sit back, enjoy your food and tea in a timely manner. My favourite on the food side must have been the Cherry Blossom Champagne Jelly, the poached lobster, citrus peel and Tahitian vanilla scone, the Easter egg chocolate basket and the macaroon with pear liqueur filling. The menu itself looks extensive, as the dishes comes out it looks a bit little for a big eater but I promise you, when you are done, you are full to the brim. We enjoyed several high teas while in Singapore, some very famous and luxurious ones, and I have to say that this one is the best by far. You can choose your own tea, the food looks amazing and everything tastes delicious. The cost when we were there was $80 / couple

For more reviews, visit my site at ms-skinnyfatHappy Easter Month of April 2014! Back at my favorite tea spot for Easter Tea and it's no other than Axis Bar & Lounge at Mandarin Oriental Singapore. I've always been impressed with Axis Bar's all rounded 3 tiered classic afternoon tea and was delighted to know they introduced something new for Easter. More excuses to head back. :)This time we were seated in a small private section that gave us a partial view of the Marina.There's a selection of Mariage FrÃ¨res and TWG teas. I had the White Night Jasmine which had a soothing jasmine perfume. Very light and fragrant tea. Coffee is also available but what's Tea without tea yea?We started with the Cherry Blossoms Champagne Jelly which was rather bland and missing everything champagne. But once the food started coming, we forgot about that misstep.The Egg salad sandwich with watercress had a nice creamy texture. I loved the Lump crab meat and avocado sandwich which was 1/3 part sweet crab meat. Bresaola and gem lettuce mini wrap with cheddar and the cucumber and cream cheese sandwich were fillers but they didn't do that bad on their own either.More savory stuff! Poached lobster with coriander mango salsa. The Carbonara Eggs en Cocotte deserves a highlight. Loved the garlic carbonara sauce at the bottom of the egg. Mix everything together and slurp it down. Satisfaction guaranteed! The Duck rilette and foie gras mousse terrine was also delightful. The scones made my day and i devoured my share quickly. That wonderful crunchy buttery goodness was just irresistible. There were 2 flavors, a Strawberry yogurt scone and a Citrus peel and Tahitian vanilla scone. I preferred the strawberry yogurt which was lightly sweetened and was good on its own. BUT i can't resist smearing it with the lovely clotted cream! And there's also the slightly tart lemon curd and the fresh raspberry jam. For puffs, we had the Easter ham and green pea pie and the Chicken and potato turnover. These are ok items though I preferred those on the regular menu.ON TO THE SWEETS!The fancy macaron with pear liquor fillings has a popping surprise in it. You gotta try it to find out. I went gaga over the presentation of the edible Easter egg basket with gianduja chocolates. The big one had an amazing caramel filling! The mini gateau had a light berry tartness that blended well with the bitter dark chocolate. I also enjoyed the buttery sable.Can't think of a better way to celebrate Easter! The Easter Tea will run for the month of April 2014 and it costs $42 per person ($80 for two)

I have to say this was a major disappointment. at $80 for two it doesn't come cheap. The setting was nice enough and the staff look professional.Two staff did not know what was on the plate and had to refer to the menu and even then matched the wrong things. . The initial jelly starter was nice, the second course of few little morsels on spoons and a tart was nothing special or decorated with any flair. The third course of sandwiches were so tiny and basic filling like one with plain old hummus. and the size of half of your thumb. Another was a plain wrap with a smudge of filling. The fried course was odd with scones which were as dry as Singapore and these were served on the same plate as the deep fried puff. Last the sweet , very sweet choc things and a plain old banana muffin with a bit of decoration. My advice is go in search of some cheaper options that are more adventurous and generous than this one. The piano player was lovely

Fantastic views over the Marina and great service. Fantastic live piano and singing on some nights as well.

One night worthy to visit, I love the place and enjoy the music with drinks. Axis Bar and Lounge have very kind of service. Just bit late to take attention.

We came here for a drink before dinner at Morton's. The service and live music were both excellent and the view of Singapore from up here made it well worth the visit.

Afternoon tea was superb much better than fortnum and masons! Service excellent, quality and presentation super. Such a great choice of tea. Would highly recommend.

A nice place to chill out for a lazy afternoon. Excellent view if given a window seat, however, it could be warm if sunlight is strong.Staff very attentive & friendly. They explain to guests on each of the course being served. Never enjoy much of the spread, as its basically "chocolate" pastries, not much on the savory pastries. Also the pastries served are non-replenishable

Good atomsphere, quality of food is there to be looking forward . View is all right depend on where r u sitting. The set is able to fill up ur appetitile no doubt for ladies ! Make sure u make an appointment at least a day b4 to book a window seat

For full post, visit: http://dairycream.blogspot.jp/2013/09/axis-bar-and-lounge-luxury-september.htmlTo find anywhere serving a good afternoon tea even on weekdays in Singapore is in itself noteworthy. But to sit down in such a relaxed setting — with a glass of 1688 Grand Rose Champagne in hand overlooking the magnificent view of Marina Bay in a comfy banquette— is cause for outright celebration. So is Mandarin Oriental’s Luxury September Bubbly Afternoon Tea. I started the 5-course (not 3) mid-day feast with a tall glass of Grand Rose champagne jelly. Followed up with the spread of savoury canapes and desserts to accompany the sweet delicate bubbles. The three-tiered set includes four kinds of special desserts that use champagne: champagne macaroons, a dainty champagne chocolate lollipop, chilled champagne and damas plum sabayon disguised as a fruit tart and a champagne cassis gateau snugged cosily in a purple chocolate wall.Take a moment of break from sweets with the bottom-tier selection of savoury canapes that are at full blast with flavours and definitely not your average egg and ham sandwiches. Take for example the duck rillettes & foie gras canapé or the truffle-scented egg & chive petite sandwich. Both canapes take turn to perfume your palates with its strong aroma and balanced well with the red fruity notes of the Grand Rosé champagne. Of course, there is no particular sequence between the 3-tier and one can jolly well hop back to the sweets which includes non-champagne selection like the Passion-Banana éclair. The Dulce De Leche Tart- a buttery shortcrust pastry with caramelized brown milk jam was so excellent that I would love to pack home a box of it.You can’t get more British with the scones in two flavours: Lemon-thyme and Strawberry yoghurt, served in true style with authentic clotted cream, strawberry preserves and a grainy lemon curd. But just in case you might think that this is the end, there are two more courses to go..... For those who are concern about alcohol, the Grand Rose is non-alcoholic. A very good healthy excuse to drink your time away, in this genteel and unhurried oasis.For full post, click http://dairycream.blogspot.jp/2013/09/axis-bar-and-lounge-luxury-september.htm

My wife and I had afternoon tea here as part of our anniversary weekend. We enjoyed the afternoon tea spread, and had a nice time. We were seated along the windows, which overlooked part of the harbour. I would say it is too low to really have a view, but nice nonetheless.As my wife was expecting and could not drink alcohol, they accommodated this, although the substitutes was less than inspiring. Maybe it would have been different if they had been informed earlier. They actually removed my share of the alcoholic treats, but gave me a portion on request.Other than that, it was a fine afternoon, with great treats to enjoy the afternoon with.Tip: Better value when you use certain credit cards (e.g. UOB), so do check when you pay for the bill

We went for an afternoon tea mid week. Whilst a nice ambiance, Lovely room and views towards the CBD but the lack of clientele meant it lacked atmosphere a little.The afternoon tea itself was great, truffled fois salted caramel chocolate lollies, the pies that arrived after the cakes and scones was a little oddly timed.The really accommodated our little one though bringing extra cakes and things for her.Very good though and would recommend

I keep forgetting writing a comment about this wonderful place and Bar oasis in Singapore. It offers the perfect place to hold business and informal conversations, private gatherings, enjoy a great (if not the greatest) in Singapore, excellent drinks and snack selection but foremost the BEST service in town. Do not miss this place when in Singapore
