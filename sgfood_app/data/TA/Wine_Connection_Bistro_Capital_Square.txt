5

We loved the other wine connection on the unity street. Well, the thing is, unfortunately this restaurant is not even close to the other. We ate the same menu in both Wine Connection, because we really liked it at the first time. The gambas was really good, as always, but the tuna salad had simply no taste and the pasta was totally overcooked. Plus they should have more chairs, we had a table without chairs. We got one chair later, but we were 4 there. Although I think this restaurant has a better location, for me they couldn‚Äôt bring the same quality. Probably we were unlucky today...

Had a Christmas party for a group of 42. Food was generally good with mostly hits but some misses. Service was commendable despite being short-staffed in front service and the kitchen! Alex, the manager, was quick to attend to my last minute request for another table to be setup as they were super packed for lunch that day. He and his staff was there to make sure everyone had a good time. Fantastic selection of wines as well. All in all great job to Alex and his team of staff
5
Our favourite Friday evening bar, whether just as a couple or with a bunch of friends. great choice of wines at great prices and great service from the management and staff.If you live/work in the CBD and haven‚Äôt tried here, you really should.
5
Fantastic service and food from warm service staff. Special compliment to Chin for the exceptional service.

Karam is the best service personnel I have ever made. Great taste in wine and food. Absolutely a fun experience with such a staff!

we have great moments at this place. very friendly staff, good food, perfect wine.
The starters are as good as in Italy or Spain. You will think you‚Äôre in Europe. Please check out the Pizza - is original napoli style.

5
The best place value for money in town.We build up great relationships with the manager and his team at capital square. We are regulars since over 1 years now.We just love it because it is very difficult to find such a place in Singapore

Went to this place thinking they would have some amazing wine - Cheap food big plates I had vegetarian pasta - it was nice My friend has the chicken parmigiana which was as dry as jerky - and was not very nice at all My husband ordered 4 bottles of wine - in which they did not have any of them - he did enjoy his steak But for a place called the wine connection they need to improve Thier stock supplies and have more on offer
5
Ashley and Merida is the best !! I their service made me feel very welcoming . Would come back again with friends . Keep it up the good work !
5
Love this place and have been here nearly every week. The service is great, the staff are friendly and best of all, fantastic value for food and wine! What else can one ask for? :)
5
One of my favourite outlets of wineco. It‚Äôs much smaller than the robertson walk one, but has some amazing staff who understand and upkeep their service levels, making it outstanding. A shoutout to it‚Äôs manager Alex-thanks for the awesome hospitality!
5
Good affordable Wines, good ambience, good food, excellent service and very friendly staff...

5
Awesome wine, food and staff are awesome!! Here pretty much 3 days a week - best place for wine food and service! Great value for money too!! Highly recommended :)
1
Came here for an after dinner drink with our kids and 2 friends.At 9pm they started to clean up and closing the doors so the toilet could not be used unless you pushed the door open again.Were told that they close at 10 (it says on the website 11pm!!) and were so utterly unfriendly. By 9.15 we left as they clearly wanted to close by 9.30.Will never come back here again!Sad that the minimum rating is 1 star.... they really do not deserve even that one
4
We stood in studio M hotel an this wine bar is close by. You can eat or just go there for a drink or two. The prices for the bottle of wine is good and not so expensive as in other restaurant. Here you can enjoying your glass of wine.
5
Wow - I am blown away...these guys have what great looks like nailed! I had dinner there tonight, by myself, and watched the way they orchestrated a perfect symphony that kept their clients singing!! The food's awesome too...but the service is what really sets them apart from anywhere else I have eaten.
5
Good food, better drinks, best service
Must try Gambas and Pizza. Wines are very reasonable price and staff are super friendly.

Best value, quality and service in Singapore - come and find out for yourselves !
I'm a regular and the staff are personal and friendly, the wines are excellent value and the menu is wonderfully varied for European taste.

First time here and im blown away by the hospitality of the manager, Alex. GREAT PLACE TO HANG AND CHILL AFTER A HECTIC DAY AT WORK!! ü§ôüèªü§ôüèªü§ôüèª
5
Manager and staff here made us fee warm and welcome. Attended to our needs and made us comfortable. Great place for a chill with friends over an evening with wine and fingerlicious food.
5
Frequent visitor and loved the serviceExcellent wine collection and recommendations by staff who are well trained in knowledge of the products Just need to change the food menuWe come here 3 times a week but the food is total let down wines and service staff are amazing
5
A location just around the corner of my office , give you the best atmosphere like a nice family home . Leading by Alex that always welcome you with a big smile and with great service ..... although the place is always booked and packed the service never drop .  Shiva the captain of the service running around and make sure that nothing is missing and we are all happy . Jessi one of the most hard working lady I ever met , lunch time , dinner time always running around and make sure everyone are happy and got what they ordered on time . Christina the assistant manager keeping her charming character to maintain the team motivated and give them the right feedback how to improve themselves. Chin , a very interesting and entertaining person that you can find in a wine place , look for her when you arrive and you will fell the vibe .Not talking about reasonable wine price and great food that always served the same taste. Always come back and never disappointed so far . I hope Alex will not go on leave so often as we miss his great service
5
I am having fun hereüëçüèº with Ashley and Chin! Service is fast here! I will be back every week üòä and I love their food and wines! I would come every week with my friends or relative üòä

Great ambience, excellent wine at very reasonable prices and fantastic service. No better place in Singapore!

Good and attentive service! Good location! Love the pizza, cheese boards and broad wine selections! No smoking is a disadvantage!

Had a lovely evening at Wine Connection Capital Sqaure this evening. Credit goes to our server Chin, who gave us Fantastic recommendation for our champagne and our wines. We were so impressed with Chin that we decided to have her recommend 2 bottles to bring home. Well done Chin! We will certainly be back!
5
Always the place to go for decent wine with reasonable price. Special mention for the enthusiastic black dragon waitress who kept on recommending us with great wines
5
Celebrating a friends "baby's head wetting" recently this is definitely the choice of bars at Capital Square. Alex is a great host, we're always looked after, albeit under shade, beautiful food and great selection of wine. A great place to catch up with friends any night of the week, but is sooo much fun on Friday after work drinks
5
Always a great evening, fantastic atmosphere, food and of course good quality cheap wine, you must ask for Alex! TOP bloke
5
Staff is very friendly and helpful! Wine is really good and reasonable too!Good ambience too! My favourite outlet for wine connection:)
5
Perfect afterwork drinking place... but i guess you'd enjoy as much if you are visiting here. Good pricing for wine and food and excellent service. The staff is always there looking after you ensuring the super good experience. Keep it up guys!
5
Fantastic wines, cheese and a plenty of nice foods...especially Jessie provided us with wonderful time and beautiful night~~. Thanks a lot!!!

We visit wine connection locations in Singapore as typically it is a good night out without typical Singapore pricing. Robertson Walk is always a hit although the tapas place there is terrible. We decided to try Capital Square on Saturday April 29th after dinner to grab dessert and some wine as we had never tried before. Got the wine, as usually great value. At 9pm we were told last call for food which is strange. We ordered Lemon (although they call it Lime) meringue and chocolate lava cake. Lets put it this way the Lemon Meringue was full of fake flavour and the chocolate lava cake was extinct as it was just a dry chocolate sponge, kind of thought it may be when it arrives in 2 minutes. Any way we know the cheese platters etc are good so just don't get dessert here.The worst part of the night though was even though it is advertised until 11pm on a Saturday they started bringing our bill at 9.30pm, we hadn't asked for it, and said the cashier is closing..... The number of people they turned away was amazing, whoever is running this is crazy to allow this to happen. OK, this isn't the liveliest of places on a Saturday as it is a weekly business place but if you are open until 11 then stay open. We sat there until about 10 and they had basically put chairs on tables all around us and asked people to leave inside as they were setting up for the next day. I really hate it when you know they are trying to get you to go so they can leave early. Id you close at 11 then clear up after people are gone, we were told they were closing at 10.30 that night for some unknown reason.I can't fault the concept as wine is cheap and cheese etc is great, staff is ok but the attitudes towards customers is not great at all. I am not saying don't go, just don't have dessert as this was terrible and don't go for a few drinks later in the evenin

I always enjoy this place, the food, ambience and the service staff are incurable. I will recommend my friends to this place, a must. Chris is fantastic!
5
Amazing place, great wines and lovely Pizza...Alex is the best manager here..reach out to him and you will be satisfied!! Cheers to Su to take care of us as well!!
5
Love the ambience and crowd and you can get this on any day of the week. Great place to wine down after work with their great collection of wine and brilliant food! But nothing Beats the hospitality of their staff.. They get to know you on a personal note and it always feels very welcoming coming here! Must try if you are in the area! When you get here, ask for Vijay, Ashley, Jessie for awesome service! Not to forget my man Alex, always makes sure I have a good time here
5
I keep coming back. Love the Prosecco, the service, the ambience, the food. A great bar anytime of the day or the week
4
One of many venues in the very busy Capital Square. Indoor and outdoor canopied seating, Nice wine selection with a mostly Italian menu. Very busy, high energy, young loud vibe. Service was very good even though it was packed. We had a nice Riesling with a cheese burger and a seafood pasta. Recommend,. Hope this helps
5
Wine connection is one of the most relaxed, and value for money wine bars in Singapore. It is one of my regular haunts also because of the amazing service my friends and I always get here. I must say that Alex, the assistant manager is very well versed in the huge range of wines they carry and is always spot on with his recommendations. Besides this, he is just very welcoming and ensures he takes wonderful care of his guests. I always enjoy having a chat with him while I hang out with our friends, and he always remembers us and what we order. Make sure you ask for Alex to look after you when you visit this branch of wine connection.

Tucked at a very convenient spot in the Central Business District, this bistro boasts a few great things - service, ambience, a great variety of wines and alcohol, as well as an alfresco section that gives it a modern European feel to it. Nothing beats sitting outdoors with a glass of prosecco carefully handpicked to soothe away the week's work troubles. Their assistant manager Alex has been impeccable in service. It is not easy dealing with a full house on Friday nights, yet he manages to show each table enough attention, including the non regular patrons. For us regulars, he engages in casual chats, never too imposing, but excellent in getting our orders in quickly. A recent addition, Yan, was also great with her attention to detail and a positive smile each time she came by the table. Food options are casual, tasty and just what you need for a chilled out Friday evening with friends, or any other evening for that matter. Their select meat and cheese pizzas are delicious. Wines and liquor are aplenty, and both managers know their selections and recommend well. One feedback I'd have is to have the junior staff be more trained in wine and spirit recommendations. Or at least have them be trained in preset basics to cater to a few different tastes. They'd be able to serve better then. The ambience is great, however on certain nights like a Friday, the lack of music in the background is obvious. Surrounded by bars that belt out tunes to add to that Friday vibe, this venue is lacking and could do with some beats to pump up the vibe and get their patrons in the mood. Hey, it might even compel some to stay longer and order more! Otherwise this Wine Connection venue is great for hangouts with friends, even family, or a casual drinks date with your partner. Just maybe call in advance for a table if you're not willing to risk it by walking in... It does get popular here
5
Great restaurant popular with the office crowds due to it's perfect position in the business district.Sue and Alex run a fine operation here- the food is good and reaonably priced, the service friendly and the wine prices must be amonst the cheapest in Sngapore.Highly recommended

This restaurant is at the edge of the CBD, so its a popular place to hang out after work. Overall space is simple in design, but the ambience is vibrant, and fills up quickly in the evenings with youthful groups of diners. Food repertoire is informal but generally good - small-plate sculpted tapas are the house specialties, but the trademark meat or cheese platters are also popular. However, the biggest draw is the fairly extensive wine list at very reasonably prices (starting at $30 per bottle). A daunting selection of imported craft beers & ales are also available, so boozers will be spoiled for choice.Staff service may understandably get a bit slow when the restaurant is packed, but the 2 friendly managers - Sue & Alex will ensure you will be well taken care of
5
The service is the best I've ever seen at a restaurant / bar. He makes sure you're well looked after - I won't mention him by name, but we all know who it is. Make sure you drink on the left side of the restaurant as you look at it. It's got the best value for money in any place in Far East Square, and the service is out of this WORLD. I used to drink at the Robertson quay wine connection, but as soon as this guy moved I had to change my local.... And by local I mean local! You can go no further than the wine connection at Far East square because the service Organised by the assistant manager - deserves a Michelin star
5
Has amazing service andI love a glass of French cider. Has my full endorsement. At the centre of the action a great location.
5
Awesome wine... and good shots... super friendly staff, used to be at roberston q outlet.... the Far East square... way up....service is outstanding... wine the reason I keep coming weekly
5
Fantastic location and the service staff is great. Especially Alex! Great place to hang out with work colleagues and friends.
Recommend!
5
Visit this place pretty often and it gets better each time. Vast spread of wines and excellent food choices topped with gold class service from folks like Alex, Su, Jesse to name a few. highly recommend!
5
Good job taking care of your customers! We feel safe here! Thank you! I will definitely want to come back! üòåüòä
5
I love Alex
Best service ever. Great food, nice selection of wine
We had 6 bottles of wine and we will keep coming for more and more
Just keep serving us
5
Impressive array of wine and ciders. Affordable plus the food is superb. But big hats off to the service staff here. Attentive and always concerned about the quality of service provided to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience. Thanks Alex and crew.
5
Superb Assistance manager! Superb wine and cider! Good music. Nice causal welcoming atmosphere. You will love it.!!
4
Always good value for food and wine. Glad to see they have opened in CBD. Good value on the specials and the drinks are reasonably priced for Singapore. No complaints at all as service was good too. Main problem is it will be too popular
5
Good food Great service n awesome bill. We are always here every now and then , so happy that the wine connection has one more branch near my office.. and this turnout to be awesome place as I found out some old servers from Robertson Q so very happy to be here every single dayCheers
5
New outfit in the area, great food and good wine. No other good wine shops in the area. Service always good (look for Alex!)
5
Ok so Alex and Sue run a superb venue for bargain gains, in a prime location ... any tourists and expats well worth checking out, the regular staff may take their time and seem slow but still worth a visit
5
If you are looking for a great place to eat and drink for a reasonable price, go to this place and feel free to ask for alex Who really brings the place a great service.
5
No place Beats Wine Connection at China Square . Good wine and food selections , perfect ambient , excellent service of the Asst Manager - Alex impress me MOST ÔºÅ
5
Good food, good wine and friendly staffs. I tried a couple of the house red and they are good. The food is also delicious.
5
I've always liked Wine Connection but having one seconds walk from my office is almost too convenient. It's not easy to be a successful bar/restaurant business at Far East Square, there are about 15 bars within a 100m radius and even more restaurants but the new Wine Connection outlet is off with a bang, drawing in crowds from far and wide, busy for lunch and almost every night. Food is great, wine selection fantastic, prices are extremely good and service especially from Alex is excellent.
5
We arrived with a pretty huge party of around 20 pax. The staff was very accommodating to our huge party and more importantly, they were very attentive to our needs. Topping up our water glasses, bringing new wine glasses to the table when we had more people streaming in to join us and they did this all without having us to signal for them. I've been to many wine connection outlets and this one has had the best service I've experienced with the chain! Keep up the great work guys!
5
We go to this place very often. Location is central and ambience is nice. Hospitable and friendly staff, value for money and excellent wines.
5
The waitress Alice was very accommodating and explained to us the menu and the philosophy of the organisation and the adjacent wine shop. The wine list is long with plenty of varieties from many different countries. Whilst we did not eat, the food on the plates looked delicious. The CR (toilette) was very clean !The prices of the wines are very reasonable
5
Last night in Singapore and popped here for some Fromage et Vin. Wine by Singapore standards v reasonable price and decent options too.Nice to sit outside and people watch. Decent platter and nice bread to accompany. Gather it's a chain here and v popular and rightly so. Service v good with plenty of check backs and top ups
5
Great beer too! Surprise! Beside the wide selection of wine, they also serve some really good craft beer. Perfect place to wind down after a long day at work
5
We love this place. Undoubtedly the best service and food in Singapore. Alice is our Favourite. We come every week and every time they always bend over backwards to help us. The food is always fresh and unbelievable prices. Definitely visit!
5
Nice environment, good food couple with great variety of wines available. If you are at a lost what kind of wine to order the friendly staff are on hand to do a recommendation for you. Compliments to the friendly and attentive staff.
5
On a sunny Saturday.....we check out at capital square and pop into wine connection.....it was an awesome afternoon with good food and excellent selection of wine at the BEST price ...simply love the ambience & the service ' we came across a very super friendly staff call jessi and Monica who gave us a wonderful service and entertained us. Frankly speaking I felt like home , never had such friendly service so far.. I would like to congratulate wine connection for giving us one more reason to go and dine at your new place...
5
Came for a Friday chillax session with 4 other lady friends. Ordered a chocolate lava cake but it wasn't "flowing ". Alerted the manager Su and she was apologetic. Came back quickly with another perfect chocolate lava cake with ice cream. William and the servers were very attentive and prompt in serving our table throughout the evening.Keep up the good job
5
I had my wife's b.day to celebrate for which i choose wine connection. The place was bit crowded being saturday night, but the service was very good. Monika helped us getting the table in a short span of time and she was excellent in suggesting some soft wines for my wife. She promptly suggested customised comte and coconut caramel considering her taste and we both loved to the core. we appreciate monika for her pleasant personality and customer serving attitudes. Kudos to wine connection..
4
They have a fantastic menu! Reasonably priced wine.. perfect place to unwind and relax after a busy day at work.. friendly and helpful staff!
5
Good varieties on the menu and good selection of fine available. They also have special event on occasion to specially taste champagne with food at reasonable price. Look for friendly staff Alice and she is able to advice what food can pair with what type of wine for your meals.
5
Today was my first visit at Wine Connection!!! Had a great time there with my friends. The staffs were very friendly and they made sure that we have an awesome Drinks & Dinner. Ms.Monica have us a very good hospitality!!! Keep on smiling Thank you Wine Connection for this delicious dinner!!!Wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year in advance
