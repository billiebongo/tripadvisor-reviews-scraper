Had the best experience, totally hipster but worth every cent. Cocktails are off the chart, the galouti kebab, nalli ghosht and jalebis were the outstanding dishes.

Met for a casual catch up with friends, the waiters were friendly and attentive. Very friendly environment for family and friends!

Went to Flying monkey with parents and kids ,its a cosy restaurant on Bussorah Street . The menu is basic with simple Indian fusion dishes . The only sore point was that the restaurant is trying to sell extremely small portions ( at the price of a regular portion) just by calling them tapas. Its an Indian restaurant , vegetarian food was not a problem Food was Ok and the place was lively as most places are in Arab street area

This was one of the first places that we saw when we entered little India. We looked at the menu then walked passed. We looked at a number of other menus and realized that we wanted Indian food so we came back. And we were right to do so. The flying monkey has great food at a reasonable price

Stumbled across Flying Monkey on a night out and was so glad we did. Despite a busy restaurant on a Saturday night we were welcomed in to the bar whilst a table was made available. Here we could snack on the many indian Tapas options whilst enjoying some superb Indian themed cocktails. The vibe in this place is great, and we really enjoyed watching the fiery cocktails be made Food wise we sampled various tapas style dishes including Chilli poppers, tandoori chicken and lentil cakes which were all excellent. Will certainly be back to try more of the menu and work my was through the cocktails list. If you like Indian food and well made indian-themed cocktails in a relaxed bar environment, this place is highly recommended

I visited the Flying Monkey on a couple of occasions and was very pleased with the food there.The restaurant is easy to find and there is parking a bit further up in the area. Keep in mind that the area gets crowded very quickly and therefore you may have to wait a bit to find a parking spot.On both visits I sat inside to escape the heat as I was there for lunch.I tried the masala fries which were excellent. The Baingan bharta was really very good. It may be a bit spicy for kids though. We tried the sheekh kabab and the chicken tikka which were both very good. My daughter particularly liked the sheekh kabab a lot.On the second visit I tried the palak paneer and the laccha paratha both of which were very good.I must point out that the service is very knowledgeable and friendly.In Singapore's competitive environment, I hope that a good restaurant like this maintains it's standards and stays around long

We’d heard about this place by word of mouth and decided to give it a shot, and am so Glad we did!! The place is located in the middle of Arab street. The atmosphere & vibe is great with live music playing on a Friday eve. We ordered the beer, and for food Malai tikka and butter chicken, jalebi for dessert. Everything was so flavourful and yum. The tikkas were literally melting. I loved the fresh crisp jalebis (try not to miss them!!) The food presentation is cool. The service was warm and very courteous. What a splendid evening we had! Highly highly recommend

Great place to visit and good on all accounts, try and visit on a weekend as they allow outdoor seating on the road with good Reggae music being played by artists. Cocktails are good but only observation is too much ice. So ask them to reduce ice. Good beer on tap also available

Visited the restaurant with some friends on a weeknight. While some of the food items were good, the biggest disappointment was their yellow dal. It was completely bland, lacking salt and a lot more. We mentioned it to the staff to make them aware of it, got a very non comittal ‘oh ok’ and that was it!! Really?The drinks were very watered down too.It’s a shame because their bhindi, kebab, jalebi etc were really tasty.Customer service plays a big role in the overall experience and this is where the restaurant lacked big time
4
The food is truly excellent - most of the starters we had were very very good, meat and veg. In mains the nargisi kofta is outstanding. Guchi pulav is very tasty as well. The butter chicken was a bit sweet for my taste. The Jalebis are ofcourse outstanding.. The cocktails are just ok.. too much ice and very little drink itself, although by SG standards they have good quantity of alcohol.A little bit of maintenance (e.g. chips at base of wall with logo) will help on ambience
5
A great place to hang out with friends for lunch. Food was great and so was ambiance. We enjoyed the outing tremendously.
5
Great Food - distinct tastes and aromas for every individual dishes
Fantastic and innovative cocktails and drinks
5
Most delicious indian food I have ever eaten in Singapore. Although abit on the pricier side, the butter chicken naan, fried okra and creative bespoke alcohol really makes me want to return.
5
Staff was amazing at guiding our unruly group on which dishes to try. So happy we listened to their recommendations. Specialty barreled aged cocktails were great too.

Chanced upon this Restaurant with no expectations... it's a small cosy place but got very noisy on a Friday night... Ppl there were having a great time with a drink... We ordered Aam Panna, Baingan Dips (Naan pcs with Baingan Bartha), Guava Salad, Chilli Poppers, Dal Fry, Baingan Salan, Lasooni Sag (All dishes come with Rice or Indian Breads) and Jalebi and Kulfi for deserts.... Each one was better than the other. Yummy food and quick service... The unit Manager Suresh was very kind and served us very well. The place is small and even food options are limited but the quality of food is very good. We will definitely visit again. It's definitely a good place for hangout with friends....

The place was a bit disappointing: despite some nice paintings on the wall, it look very grey and cold overall - the round grey tables and the bright lights do not make the place cosy at all (not to mention the aircon, too strong).However, the food was really good and good value for money. The staff was very nice too

Arab quarters is filled with Mediterranean cuisine from all countries in that region and hence this place which serves Indian cuisine and Indian quirky cocktails is a welcome change.The ambience is lovely and comfortable, staff is friendly.We tried Gulaboo and the signature Flying Monkey cocktail and found them interesting. The starters were great and well cooked. Good place to try out!!

Located on the bustling Bussorah Street, this restaurant is a must try for their unique twists on cocktails and some great food. We grabbed a seat outside on the street as the weather was nice. Their quirky menu reminded me of our illustrated story books from when we were growing up in India - nostalgia! :) They have interesting cocktails and we started off with "Mind It!" (a Monkey 47 Gin infused with jasmine) and it was fantastic with the delicate notes of jasmine coming through. It was served in a small stainless pail with jasmine flowers piled over ice - so pretty. We ordered Lamb Barra and Mustard Gobhi to go with it. The gobhi was outstanding and a must-must-must try! We sampled other cocktails like Yo Yo Mani and the West Indian (I thought the cardamom did not go too well with the rum). Kudos to them for the innovative way of serving the cocktails. For the main course, we ordered Lasooni Saag and Gucchi Pulao - both were delicious. We wrapped up the meal with Jalebi which came with rabri on the side and the jalebis were crispy with just the right amount of sweetness - hand down the best we had in SG.The service was good and the staff was attentive. The ambience was nice as live music is played on the street every night and you get to enjoy your drinks and food with some good music. I highly recommend this place for their cocktails and some absolutely lip-smacking Indian food. A hidden gem

This restaurant is situated in the bylane located close to Beach Road. The ambience outside the restaurant is really good and lively as there was live music playing around. It was a wonderful atmosphere. The food even though it is Indian but did not have a typical taste which is usually seen in the Singapore restaurants. The starter we had Chilly Poppers is a Rajasthan delicacy which is really tasty. Also we had Mustard Gobhi which was also very delicious. For the drinkers there is also the very popular rum Old Monk which has the old world feel to it that was good too. I had it for the first time and enjoyed it. The food was excellent loved it paneer kofta, lasooni saag, aloo and dal fry. A person called Suresh assisted us in our food selection and recommended us the dishes. He is from Kerala and looks like Leslie Lewis from India. Thanks to him. The food here is also not very expensive. Would love to come again to this place and try their other chain of restaurants as well. Overall a gr8 unforgettable experience and absolutely recommended for vegetarians as well Coudnt have been a better place to celebrate my success.

Took my husband for a birthday meal at Flying Money. We love Indian food and had really high hopes that we were discovering a gem. Guess what? We were right! We especially loved the cocktail menu, which is inspired by Indian cuisine. I had a wonderfully cardamom scented concoction with rum and coconut water. Perfectly prepared; not too subtle, not too overpowering. The staff were attentive and friendly. We were recommended the lamb (marinated overnight in gravy) and the special, an enormous thali platter with five veggie curries and raita for dipping. Although we were stuffed, we finished every delicious morsel. I would say it's reasonably priced for the quality. We really enjoyed the music and ambiance too. I already know we'll be visiting Flying Monkey again and again
5
Had a fantastic meal with lots of delicious dishes (none were bad). Sat outside in an ambient setting. Would definitely return for great Indian food.
5
Great Indian Tapas - unique idea and went down well with some yummy cocktails! Barman was especially helpful making bespoke drinks when asked.
4
A group of us went and shared many small dishes. Everything was delicious from naan to ladies fingers to kebabs. The cocktail list is also unique and clever. I'll be back!
4
I went with a group of friends and really loved it. Basically Indian style tapas and the manager was great with his suggestions. They also have an interesting cocktail menu too. Must try the lamb shank!
5
While we did not eat dinner, I highly recommend going here for drinks. Head bartender "The Beard" makes some incredible concoctions. He also has many good stories and is fun to talk to. It's an easy spot to find, located on a busy street. Order drinks from the menu, or request something made special for your taste. A fun spot

I guess another visit is needed to try them, as i visited twice, once for a take away in the evening, it was deserted and seems not much of interest were shown by servers, then visited again during lunch with colleague and it was a different atmosphere with every guest paid attention with lots of staff, food was good, even recommendation shared by servers, so as of now i am rating it average, but this may change based on my next experience.... also they do not have lunch buffet, Additionally, i found it on a bit expensive side, however, the food was pretty tasty but smaller portion... Good part they have a bar, outdoor sittin
5
We went to the area, hoping to eat middle eastern food and chanced upon this place and decided to try it. This decision we will never regret. The food was excellent chicken tikka was very tender and flavorful, galauti kabab so yummy. Bhindi kurkure was so crisp, I have never seen such crispy bhindi. The service was prompt and the staff courteous. Overall a very good experience. Highly recommend this place.
4
The food is actually quite good, I can't really say if it is authentic Indian but it definitely matches and competes with many other places in Singapore...and wins. They made bespoke cocktails and quite amusing to look at as well to taste. I suggest you try when visiting Arab Quarter around dinner
4
In the midst of all the Lebanese food is this place. Interesting decor, especially the murals. Themed cocktails were unexpected, unmistakably Indian, uniquely presented and really nice. The food was similarly clearly Indian derived but all with clever and delicious twists, generally presented very appetisingly and tapas style. Good use of texture and contrast in the food. Keep it up
5
Have visited twice and the food has been excellent both times. The best butter chicken in singapore - and I have been to virtually every North Indian restaurant in town. The lamb chops are also delicious- though expensive. We tried a multitude of starters including Malai kebab (which melts in your mouth), the fried okra which is delicately spiced, the guava chat, papaya kebabs, etc. The deserts are also amazing- the jalebi is crisp and hot, served with rabri, the kulfi and gulab jamuns were also delicious. One the few five star restaurants in singapore for me.
5
Quiet expensive(but no more so than the rest of Singapore) but well worth it. Cocktails look great and taste delicious and the food was equally good. Good banter from the barman too. Well worth a visit if you are in the area.
5
Great food great ambience. Could do with slightly bigger portions :D
But that shouldn't take anything away from the great experience I had
4
Very innovative concept and good ambience.
Got good advice on when to choose which cocktail.
Monkey on fire is an excellent cocktail. Great entertainment value.
The restaurant is a bit bit pricey though
5
During our short visit, we had 2 dinners there. Ended up trying 9 different things from the menu, and they were all perfectly seasoned. My wife were very impressed with the vegetarian dishes, and I enjoyed the slow cooked lamb in particular.
5
Some of the best Indian we have ever tasted. The tapas are melt in the mouth, the lamb shank, butter chicken, garlic naan and saag were off the chart. The Indian pretzel dessert was the perfect ending. We're already planning our next trip.

This restaurant was recommended to me recently so I thought I would give it a spin although I have to say that when I heard that it is in the Arab Street area I was very skeptical as I've generally been disappointed by restaurants in this area.Well...how wrong I was! This turned out to be some of the best North Indian food I've ever had in Singapore. This certainly wasn't the hand of a South Indian or a Bangladeshi cook. The food could not have been more authentic and judging by how tender the meats were, this was a dab hand at work.I was intrigued to see Galouti kebab on the menu. This is an extremely arduous dish to make but the result, if done right, is like heaven on a plate. I was even more surprised when the kebab came to us what it looked and tasted just like Yantra's famous Galouti kebabs. Later I discovered that the chef used to work at Yantra - and that's when everything fell into place.The other dish that was superb was the Malai kebab. You will find this dish in pretty much every Tandoori restaurant - but I don't think I've ever had it this tender. The Lamb Barra kebab was very good too although I felt it could have done with a little more seasoning and bite. Even so, if I'm not mistaken, it's about half the price of Yantra's version. To me the Nargisi Kofta was the most enjoyable dish. The mutton was incredibly tender and there was oodles of gravy to scoop up with the excellent garlic nans. The only qualm that I had with this dish was that it was rather expensive at twice the cost of the Malai chicken. Perhaps at $24 they should be serving two koftas? I'll definitely be back again but there are some improvements they can make. First, the service level was rather low energy and the waitress who took our order made a couple of mistakes. On a day when the restaurant wasn't crowded, that's really not good. The second thing is that I don't think the round tables work, especially when you try to put them together for a group of say four people. Anyway, check this place out - superb food at a time when so many Indian restaurants in Singapore have become terribly overpriced

Really cool concept with delicious Indian tapas, great tasting cocktails and nice ambience.The Calamari 65 and Chilli Poppers are good spicy starters. The Meen Kulambu is amazingly delicious and the jalebi is an ideal way to finish your meal.There is a good selection of drinks, especially cocktails.A must visit in Singapore for good Indian food
4
New place, Delicious Indian food - the kebabs and spices are perfectly done. Malai tikka just melts in the mouth, and the kurkuri bhindi is exactly that - crispy and yummy. The fish (meen kalimbu) with malabari paratha was very good - butter chicken was delicious too, although a little sweet. Quail mussallam is a must try. In desserts we tried jalebi, loved it. Starter portions are a bit small. The main dish is adequate for one person though. Price wise - around SGD 40-45 will leave you full up to the brim (without drinks). Would visit again for sure!
5
Very very tasty food!!! Very very small portions though. They had live music the evening we went. Quick service. Would definitely recommend. Well worth visiting but not cheap!!! As I said, the portions are small. So be ready to part with quite a bit of money of you want to fill up your tummy
