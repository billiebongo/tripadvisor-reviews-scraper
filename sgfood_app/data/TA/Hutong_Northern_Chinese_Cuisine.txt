Had a delicious meal at Hutong, Clarke Quay. Probably one of the nicest Chinese meals I have had. It was a little pricey though!
4
Expensive as rest of the area is
Good food for all palates
- they charge for wet tissue napkins ,which is not good

Our first evening in Singapore and we wandered out of our hotel and along to bustling Clarke Quay. It was daunting to make a choice of restaurant from the dozens in that area but the menu here appealed to us and the welcome was friendly. We particularly wanted to sit near the riverside and a table was found within a short while, whilst we waited at a nearby table.An extensive menu – mainly Asian / Chinese dishes provided plenty of choice and I took advantage of Happy Hour “2 beers for the price of 1” Tiger beer, ofcourse) whilst my wife enjoyed a tasty “mocktail”.We chose a main dish each and shared a portion of fried rice. The bill came to Sin$90.51 including tip

Sat in the Spanish restaurant next to it to start with as no barrier segregates the ,two just different colour seats.Before the meal two plates with spoons and sealed packets with wet wipe towels in to clean your hands. These towels are a cost option on the bill at the end. Which was a first for me.The food arrived quickly and was tasty and hot.One starter two mains and two beers two hand wipes 77.56 Singapore dollar
4
I often eat here as it is good food at a reasonable price and service is good, The range of dishes is adequate although somewhat limited. The price of the drinks is reasonable but should offer glasses of water instead of having to pay for bottled especially when ordering a full meal
4
We looked at the menu and placed our order based on the lovely photos on the menu. What we were served was nothing like the photos, but I don't care it was so tasty. This restaurant was lovely with a perfect location by the river. My only problem is it was very pricey as we paid $101 for crispy chicken, beef wraps, sliced mango and two beers
5
With 6 adults and 7 kids in toe we decided on Hutong for our Poppy's 70th birthday celebration. At last minute notice the amazing Emily found us a table by the waterside. She made it an incredible experience with her efficiency and welcoming smile. Without any hesitation she knew exactly what meal and drink choice everyone had made and each was served their delightful selection. Emily was excellent, the food enjoyable, the location, except for the permanent boat restaurant right in found, was wonderful
5
Clarke Quay's river waterfront is a great place for dining and offers a lot of restaurant choices, but it would be hard to go past Hutong. We over-ordered but each dish was so delicious we couldn't help but finish all of them. The crispy noodles were exactly that, and when they were brought to the table for us to pour over the sauce, they were a perfect sensation in the mouth.Unfortunately for lunch it was too hot and humid to sit outside, and sadly we didn't have time to return for dinner when the night lights would be very pretty.The restaurant is expensive, especially the wines, but in this place you get what you pay for, including professional, affable staff
2
Visited the restaurant with my family on the eve of Wesak day. While a young polite Chinese gentleman was taking the order, we ordered a Blended Lychee for my son with less ice. A Filipina waitress out of no where appeared and said that "cannot make less ice" without even recommending an alternative option.Thereafter we continued to order and while my wife was ordering Yellow noodles from the Chinese gentleman, this Filipina appeared again saying you can eat that because it has egg. I was completely amazed at her behaviour and poor body language. She didn't even say "excuse me" nor apologise for her intrusion. I immediately asked her what was she doing while we were ordering from the Chinese Gentleman and she simply answered "oh I am training him". To begin with I believe she needs more training than him. He was very courteous all the way.We must admit that the food was good but the Filipina waitress completely ruined our mood. When we requested to see the Manager, we were told that the Manager wasn't around. What kind of an establishment is this in a tourist spot? Where is your customer service?After our dinner we paid the bill of 170 Dollars and left. A Kind Taiwanese Management Trainee was sweet enough to apologise and waived the service charge which we didn't even ask for
4
We chose to sit outside adjacent to the river which was a nice setting watching the Bumboat tours going up and down the river. Seating is available inside if you want air conditioned comfort. The food was very tasty and the service was good. We shared the 3 appetizer platter and followed with Hutong BBQ Pork, Roast Crispy Chicken half, egg white fried rice for main course as well as large sparkling mineral water and two Tiger beers. The total cost was of SGD117 which was a bit expensive
4
Been here 4 years ago and it's still the same good service and food quality, Wonderful view over the river especially at sun down.
4
Great food, great reception, but higher price than average.With a nice view on quark quay. Do not hesitate :)
3
We had dinner with the family last thursday. The Food was Good.The staff could be more courteous.Quite Pricey.
5
Coffee spare ribs! Strange idea but absolutely delicious.
Chicken and mushrooms hotspot. Simple but perfect accompinament. Fried rice with egg. Light dish to tie it altogether.
4
Just recovering from the flight from the UK and the inevitable time difference we wanted something close to our hotel serving Chinese food and this restaurant fitted our requirements very well. Service was friendly and efficient but not pushy and the food was delicious. There was a special offer on drinks which was a bonus. A great start to our holiday
4
As many of others have stated the place is a bit pricy for what it is. The location though is difficult to beat. I suffered none of the service issues that others reported and indeed concur that they went out of their way to source me wifi and talk about the happy hour offers. The stand out though was the food the prawn dumplings were great but they were beaten by the beef hotspot, of you like spicy Chinese food, I order you to get this dish. It is amazing!!
5
This restaurant is located right on the waterfront at Clarke Quay, with the option of inside or outside dining. We chose the former as the Singapore River Festival was in full swing, making it very noisy outside.Service was very attentive, without being annoying and meals arrived promptly in spite of a very busy kitchen. Meals were fresh, flavoursome and attractively presented.Prices could be classed as a little high but that goes with this location. Server did make a point of letting us know about the closing of the Happy Hour drinks pricing
3
This is one of the many riverside restaurants catering to the tourist trade. The menu is interesting although not extensive, the portion sizes are not the largest but the quality of the food is good. The beer was served in a chilled glass which was very welcome, albeit not cheap. There are better value restaurants nearby where the staff seem more interested in their jobs rather than spending time trying to get more customers in
4
This isn't about the food (it was fine) or the beer (it was a cold draft Tiger on the usual sultry Singapore afternoon, so it was wonderful), but about one woman going a step beyond in offering service. I had walked pretty much the length of the river, needed a beer and a quick, light meal. Hutong looked as inviting as any. I also wanted to check my email, so i first asked if they had wi-fi. She said yes. Sat down, ordered the beer, a plate of Beijing pork dumplings and an asparagus salad thing. Tried to log in to the wi-fi - it required a Facebook logon. I don't do FB - there is enough trouble in the world. So, ask the waitress what could be done. She said something about maybe having to provide personal details and went into conference with a colleague. Clearly the system wasn't working. After a short while she came back with her phone and logged me in to her hot spot. Thank you. Wonder how many restaurants around the world where that would happen. (The dumplings were good. The asparagus didn't quite work with the mayo. With two beers, S$50. Service, priceless.
5
Went there tonight with our 7 month old son. The waitress was extremely friendly and very accommodating towards our son. Delicious entrÃ©e and amazing mains. We were warned about the dishes being spicy but didn't find that to be the case - actually would have been nice to have a bit more heat. Price was a little more than we had planned but felt it was worth it
3
Ate here on a Sunday night. Not overly busy. Sevice was a bit disjointed with entrees arriving late or not at all. Food OK but not a cut above. Reasonable eats and fairly priced.
3
Stopped here for dinner on our way back to our hotel from Gardens by the Bay. It was getting on 9 pm & most of the restaurants along Clarke Quay were full - Hutong was the only place at the time that didn't have a people waiting for a table - given we were stuffed & desperately wanting to get off our feet we elected to give it a go. Even though it was about 30% full it took ages to clear & set a table for us, then it took even longer to get someone to take our order & then entree, mains & beer all turned up together after about 5 mins?The food was pretty average - but the bill was much higher than average. Tip: next time your taxi driver tells you the best & least expensive Chinese food is in Chinatown - listen to him & get out of the cab there
4
It was a flying visit to Clarke Quay and not much was on offer. It is much more lively at night. We chose the set menu and received a flavoursome and generous theee courses at a very reasonable price. Pleasant service too.
5
Me my wife and young daughter ate here tonight, we found it great! Good service, good food (big portions) and great staff.The staff made our visit by being very accommodating with our toddler, provided plastic plates bowls and cutlery and a high chair. We would defiantly recommend.
3
We decided to go there after waiting for more than 60 minutes in Hai Di Lao and regretted the decision. The menu was costly, just the two of us had one bowl of white rice with two appetiser, one green vegetables, bbq pork and tea for portion of two, it cost $90+Quality of the food was just alright, nothing remarkable. Service attendant weren't friendly at all and seems to be in annoyance when we couldn't decide on menu and didn't provide any recommendation or assistance.I do not recommend this restaurant in any case and will never return
4
Went to Hutong with my girlfriend and had a nice place located at the river under a red lampion. The waiter was standard friendly, the food was good. I can especially recommend the dumblings, which we had as starter and after the main dish we ordered one more set of dumplings - so to say as dessert. As per the waiter, the dumblings are freshly prepared every morning.We shared a jug of tiger beer for 25 SGD ++, which I think is fair for Singapore prices
3
After a trip along the Singapore River I decided upon a meal at Hutong for the evening, seated alongside the river. The dishes ordered were all tasty though I did find one of the two sauces that accompanied my mains not to my liking, it's flavour I thought not the best match to the food. The Singapore sling I had with my meal was certainly nice, not having had before it was quite enjoyable. For entrée, mains and the sling total was just shy of $60 for just myself, which I guess was okay given I was on the river.
5
Stopped here on my last day in Singapore after a river cruise. I arrived at the very end of the lunch period, but was still provided with excellent service & excellent food. I felt that the fixed price lunch (what do they call it there -- the lunch set) was a decently priced offering: appetizer, soup, entrée and cold beverage for about SD$ 15. It satisfied me and I would go back again
4
Your favourite Chinese dishes with a twist. Good value for money and the staff are really friendly! Location is great in the heart of the exciting Clarke Quay
4
enjoyed a lovely dinner sharing 4 appetizers between 2. lovely clean restaurant and outside seating area. on the waters edge with a great view of the river and all the nightlife going on in the area
5
We were looking for small, simple and lots of flavour... Hunting was perfect. Calamari, prawns in wasabi mayonnaise and asparagus were really perfect for us. Recommend this restaurant in Clarke Quay Singapore
4
As we had not booked and it was the start of Chinese New Year we were lucky to hey a table. We chose chicken, beef and rice and 2 beers. Food was delicious but bill was 120 ad
5
We had an amazing meal here! Crispy chicken and calamari starter which were both incredible. Then we shared a beef soup broth thing, again amazing and the best thing ever was the crispy chicken roll things, kinda like duck and pancakes, but chicken! A-MA-ZING!! Right on the riverside at Clarke quay, worth the money
3
Hutong has a wonderful setting on Clarke Quay by the Singapore river. There is a very nice outdoor seating area where you can watch the world go by. Service was OK. The northern Chinese cuisine on offer is good, but not spectacular, and is expensive compared to other places in Singapore
4
Visited a weeknight for a business dinner, we were four. Emelyn the supervisor was very helpful and understanding in our need for a quiet table to talk. She also helped us out choosing the right dishes, asking us individually which taste we preferred or disliked - great service and great food.I found the prices very nice also :-) - but drinks (beer) quite expensive as always in Singapore ........Will definitely come back and can only give highest recommendation.- please note though, that normally they will charge for the "wet tissues", so remember to comment before asking the bill, then not
4
The dishes we selected were no different from what we would eat in Australia and similarly priced, but they were fresh, well cooked and very tasty. The staff were efficient and looked after us very well. There was a happy vibe to the restaurant and its location at Clarke Quay is a plus. If you feel like a good Chinese give it a try and make sure you arrive in time for Happy Hour (6-8pm) it will soften the bill
4
Ate here on our first night in Singapore.Enjoyed the food which came promptly despite the apparent huge size of the restaurant.Friendly service.A little on the expensive side
5
Great Chinese - great location on Clarke Quay and really good food. Well priced food and very friendly waitresses. Drinks and taxes really add to the bill but overall a good experience
4
Variety of dishes all with pleasant regional flavours.Service was very good with pleasant wait staff.One dish, which way too spicey was quickly replaced with understanding
3
The staff wasn't welcoming and pleasant, even though the restuarant was busy, an hospitality feature was missing, a smile was covered and service was hurrying. The food was awsome but quantity preferred should be abit more as compared to the price
4
I enjoyed my Peach Passion smoothie along with dumplings and Kung Boa Chicken. Nicely prepared food and attentive service. I ate early by most dinner standards in Singapore(6:00), so the crowd was small.
4
The food was tasty and well presented. Didn't all come at the same time but was worth the wait. Served by Yen yen who was cheerful and very helpful. Will go back.
4
on an evening out with a colleague we gave this place a try. we only tried a few dishes, Noodles, Fish, Crab, those that we had were really good. Sure we could have paid less elsewhere, but never the less good food.
4
I always visit this restaurant whenever i am in singapore. A good quiet restaurant in Clarke Quay - try to get a place outside :) The service is good and rapid. Wide variety of food - my favorite is the chicken mushroom hotpot and fried rice - simply great
4
Nice to find a place at Clarke Quay that's not under pressure to be hip and preppy, one that's comfortable to serve traditional Chinese Singapore flavors, and where the chef and servers accommodated the dietary restrictions of our party yet churned out delicious food. Place is clean and elegant without trying too hard. Kudos
4
We sat inside as there was limited outside seating and on a hot night inside was the best choice, sure you don't have a view of the river and the bum boats, whoopee do. To be honest I chose Hutong as the lure of a jug of margaritas for $25 was great value for anywhere at Clark Quay. Two yummy dishes and the jug cost close to $100 including the ++, good value
3
It was our first evening in Singapore, we ambled our way around Clark Quay taking it in looking for somewhere to eat and I chose Hutong.No one was eating inside and not all the seats were taken outside so we chose to sit at the end looking out on the quay to add more comfort to our meal.I found the waitress to be impatient. She returned and hovered not long after providing our menus, rather than ask if we were ready or looking to see if our menus were closed. My Thai girlfriend's reading of English is limted, so more time was needed and I felt obliged to order some water just to get rid of the waitress., When the drinks were delivered she hovered and again I informed her that we were still not ready and call when we were. In the end we were served by a different waitress when I politely hailed for service. The other waitress was nicer and even asked how the food was, which I will tell you as well.I chose the fruit sweet and sour pork balls and spare pork ribs. The food was tasty, the ribs were tender and it was no struggle to get the meat off the bone. The fruit and sweet and sour pork was an interesting dish which my girlfriend certainly enjoyed.The main dishes were $22 and $24 each, with rice at $2 each. $7.50 for a large bottle of mineral water.Though the main surprise was receiving the refreshment towels and a very small mint after we informed the waitress that we had finished. I thought complientary as a thank you to our having our custom. The bill came afterwards showing that we had been charged each $0.30 on the towels, which of course is then subject to service charge and tax. Cheeky is you ask me. Felt necessary to take them having paid for them
4
We were terribly hungry after hanging out at some place and we're looking for some decent Chinese food!We were apparently the last customer but the staff said the kitchen was closing and if we don't mind, place our order asap. So we quickly place our drinks and food order .The food came fairly quick, I suppose the chef wanted to go home soon.So I must say the food was very delicious. It was way better than what I thought it'll be. If spicy food isn't a drawback for you, order the hot and spicy boiling fish fillet soup. It was by far the best spiciest soup I've eaten.The food was u expectedly good.Service was average. Wet tissue and napkins were free, unlike some place that charge, and it only came to my table after asking for it.I suggest everyone tries out this place
4
We ate outside right on the river.The service was OK and the food was good. I enjoyed my chili crab and I was pleased that half way through the meal the waitress brought over more napkins as the two tiny paper napkins I had at the start were never going to be enough
4
We enjoyed our meal here. The service was good, the food was beautifully prepared, and the wine by the glass very nice, both the red and white.But it is not cheap. On the other hand, we ate in a neat and clean air conditioned place by the river!Overall enjoyable
4
Tried a number of the restaurants in Clarke Quay - Hutong was my favourite.Great food - friendly staff.
4
I had the steamed groupa and it was perfect. I guess it is an easy dish to get right, but they did get it right. S$40 was one of the most expensive dishes on their menu. They had a good-value four course set lunch with two choices for $S35, but I felt like something tasty but light, since I had to fly that evening.I was the only one there, but I dined very late for lunch, aiming to skip dinner. Perhaps they were busier earlier
3
Situated at Clark Quay the location is very good.The Staff and initial service was very slap happy, and if we hadn't ordered beers and entrees we would have left and gone elsewhere.However the entrees arrived promptly and were hot and tasty, so we ordered the mains and were not disappointed.I wish that we would have seen one of the earlier reviews re napkins, and the price as when we paid the bill we didnt check, although it seemed exspensive.We also had to ask for napkins as rgere were none on the table.Overall the location and decor is very good.Staff need some work.Tip if you go check the bill carefully
2
Four of us ate here tonight and the food was tasty. That was the only good point. A waiter tried twice to deliver food that was intended for another table. Our main courses were delivered before our starters, which we had to send back and wait for the starters. The service was very slow. Now the scam! There were no servietes on the table so we asked for some. Two plates were brought over with paper napkins and wet wipe type napkins on them. We obviously used both types of napkins and concluded our meals. When we got our bill we found that we had been charged for the wet wipe napkins!!! We asked for the manager, no one understood what we were saying then......what a surprise! Eventually one of the waitresses said she was the boss. We then complained and all she did was shrug her shoulders. It was not a lot of money but it is the first time in my life I have been charged for a napkin! Eat elsewhere, there is plenty of choice
1
We ate here last night during our first visit to Clarke's quay. I didnt expect too much from a restaurant in such a prime location however the food really was absolutely terrible, the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten and at a high price! The service was also poor, our plates had still not been cleared after paying the bill. Very disappointing for our last night in Singapore.
4
We ate here last night, the food was lovely. We had a table on the water, we ordered the calamari, dumplings, garlic pork wrap dish, wasabi prawns and roast chicken.Best: pork wraps, calamari and dumplings!Wasabi prawns - too battered but flavour ok.Chicken - a little dry.They also had no sparkling wine which was disappointing!Overall a lovely experience for dinner
1
Stupidly expensive! Low and slow service.We didn’t get all the food that we ordered, but after we tasted what we finally got, we decided to just save the money... We were 4 adults and 3 children, ordered a lot of different courses to shareWaited over 1,5 hours for the food, the restaurant was NOT full....(how awful must that be to visit when full?) The bill was full of errors... if you, despite this warning, choose to go here, be aware – check the bill.Nice view to the river, but you can get it for free from the bridge at Clark Quay...It is possible to get a gourmet dinner at a nice, decent restaurant for the price we paid here.The advice is: Find another restaurant
4
As neither myself nor my husband was very hungry, the staff were very helpful in steering us through the menu, suggesting what might be too filling, too spicy etc. We ended up having steamed wontons and spicy beef noodles. All in all a very pleasant everin
4
We enjoyed beautiful food and a competitively priced bottle of wine overlooking the river watching the bum boats tour up and down adorned with Christmas lights and candy canes. The service was very good , and i can thoroughly recommend the Crispy Soft Shelled Crab dish , so nice we returned for a second helping.
4
Started my multi-day b-day celebration here. It was very pleasant by the river. The food was good. The happy hour beers were a bit on the warm side. Service was prompt and helpful (especially in providing extra spices for one of us who likes things hot)
2
Had a noodle soup (small), BBQ pork (not BBQ, fried instead) and a tiger beer, for total 50 SGD.
The location at the river is nice.
5
We had beef fried rice, 2 fried noodle with seafood, shrimp wonton soup and 2 calamari for dinner.
The taste was very good and the waiters were all very nice.
1
Worst chilli crab ever it was dried up spat out chilli crab on dried dead stuff. The towelettes you are given you have to pay for they are not complimentary. "Here TRY some pickled vegetables" - NO don't take them they are not complimentary and this is never mentioned to you at the time. The prawn noodles had 3 small prawns with greasy noodles. The service was terrible and the total of the bill was disgusting for what we were given to eat. We waited over 20 minutes for our change. It was so dark you could not see what was on the bill which added to our frustration. Totally, totally over priced. Go to East Coast seafood centre for the best seafood. Do not waste your time with this place the only way to describe it is move on and don't stop
3
My boyfriend and I ate dinner here and had fantastic food. But one of my most hated things happened! When we sat down the wait staff were friendly and prompt. Then they bought our drinks over and a little dish of bean sprouts & vegetables. I didn't give it a second thought. We went on to eat fantastic entree a fried chilli chicken and mains beef & Fried beef noodles. Then had a very rude shock when receiving the bill! $140 Australian dollars - we didn't have any alcohol. And its not like we had a whole lobster! 1 entree & 2 mains And were charged approx $8 for the bean sprouts! I couldn't believe it! The service charges were un reasonable. We did leave with the feeling we had a filling and very delicious meal.. but the price
1
Worst chilly crab I have ever tasted and service to match. Asked for a non smoking table, and ours must have been the only non smoking table. Surrounded by smoke and lousy chilly crab. Worst $130 I have ever spent in a restaurant. Keep away from this place. Go to Jumbo or No Signboard restaurant for good chilly crab.
1
Shoved down the back of the restaurant and forgotten. Meals took an hour to come out and I honestly would have walked out had we not had had two hungry kids in tow. Food was average and massively overpriced. Wasn't just us either I saw other patrons getting frustrated. Obviously just trading on location.
1
We visited this restaurant during a stop over stay in Singapore. After the order of beverage was placed the waitress told us, that the cuisine will close in a few minutes, we can order, but she would'nt know if everything will be available for cooking. The dish were served without napkins and without spices. During we were eating the waitress told us that we had to pay, because they will be closing asap. Once before we were finished with eating the waitress began to clean up the table. After the dinner we wanted to pay with credit card and the waitress had taken the credit card but didn't come back with the payment device. However, 2 minutes later I went into the restaurant and asked to get my my credit card back. To cap it all, this chinese food everything but authentic!I will NEVER join this restaurant again! No recommendation from my point of view
1
So after a 30 min wait for our appetizers, my husband asked if we should leave. Not wanting to hunt for another restaurant I said "no-lets stay". Big Mistake. Sweet and Sour Pork should have pork in it. Not fried dough balls drenched in sweet sauce. Then mixed veggies showing Asparagus-nope-no asparagus!. Lamb Skewers? How about dried shoe leather. Yum! Then -to top this all off-"BBQ Spare Ribs?". Nope-dry, thin pieces of a McRib with cold dry stale pancakes. McDonalds would have been better. Please save your money, time and aggravation. Oh-they explained it off as a miscommunication-Nope-Just plain bad food. All for $100. Priceless
4
We were walking along the river looking for somewhere for lunch and trying to decide which cuisine we felt like when we found Hutong. The blackboard out the front offered a set lunch meal for $15 per person. Soup, choice of entree and choice of main course and a Lime Juice or Soft Drink. We decided to try this probably not expecting too much for the set meal as the choices were limited. As it was quite hot that day and we had done a lot of walking we asked for a glass of water first up. Our waitress seemed a little shocked at our request and honestly I was surprised that water is not offered when you first arrive in a restaurant especially with the climate of Singapore. Anyhow our glasses of water arrived and she had also put in ice even though we had not thought to ask for this too!! She also brought us our glass of Lime Juice each that was part of the set lunch.We ordered our entrees each. I ordered spring rolls and my husband ordered wontons. We were served our corn soup which I must say was very tasty. Then the entree arrived. I was only expecting one spring roll with the set lunch but was surprised to see that I had two spring rolls and my husband had two wontons. Both of a reasonable size and very delicious. Next our main course....My husband ordered the crispy noodle with seafood and I ordered fried beef noodle with seafood sauce. Honestly we could not fault either meal....the serving size was good, there was plenty of seafood/meat and vegetables in the meal and it was full of flavour. I really could not find anything wrong with the meal and we both felt as if we had eaten plenty and it was good value. you can check out the menu and this lunch offer on their facebook page which I went looking for after we had eaten there. Apart from the first hiccup about a drink of water the service was ok and the waitress quite pleasant
1
We tried this restaurant based on how nice the dining area outside looked with chinese lanterns by the river. The menu sounded good but the food quality was poor for the price and it felt like a tourist trap. They put towlettes on the table for us to wipe our hands after eating - after using them we found that we had been charged on the bill for them! They did remove this when requested but it was very cheeky to even put it on there. In addition they brought out the mains at the same time as we were having just finishing our starter so it felt like we were being rushed out of there to get the next set of tourists in
