I bought YuSheng from this restaurant every year and I never ever thought that this famous restaurant will ever cheat their customer by selling Abalone Yusheng(The size of the abalone as you can see from the picture) size smaller that 10cent. OMG...they even have the face to tell me that they has order the wrong abalone only after they prepared and I'd paid... this restaurant still have face to put up all the Celebrities picture visited their restaurant... if you think of having any outing at this restaurant, I would suggest you think twice

Sad to give a bad review of an old institution,.....Had a craving for Popiah and decided to have my fill with a small pot (can make 6 roll) to share with friend.The fillings are bland (not too salty nor too sweet). The skin wrap is kinda tough. The condiments....peanut is not roasted, omelette is so thin it don’t add to the taste.The only highlight is the super super spicy hot Chillie. Which effectively kills (or camouflage) the tasteless fillings.Very unsatisfactory Popiah. Had to go Toa Payoh to fix my Popiah craving the next day

Being hot and humid is standard in Singapore. I love the local food but drenching in sweat doesn’t feel too pleasant to enjoy the food (no matter how good it is).In search of a good Popiah place, this is a great one for Popiah lovers recommended by a local friend.You make the popiah yourself. I love the fact that you can put the stuffs you like in your own Popiah. In addition, if you like the crunch peanuts, you can load it up into your making too. Isn’t that awesome?Be careful of the chili sauce as it’s very potent even for locals!I also tried the Or-Ni (yam dessert). It’s not too oily, and not loaded with lard. Texture was smooth with ginkgo nuts in it. But coconut sauce is a little diluted and lacks fragrance. They probably used the can version as opposed to fresh-squeezed version. I was told that most people don’t do it the “hard way” these days, but Singapore being a food heaven, I’m sure if they make it the traditional way, they could create a better reputation for themselves. Environment is clean and aircon is powerful enough. Seating is limited and they don’t take reservation. So make sure you go early to grab a place.Definitely a restaurant I would recommend and return for good Popiah

First time visit with friends for dinner. The popiah is the signature dish and their pork leg fried beehoon is also one of the "must eat" dish. It's decently good, with very home-cook local style. We also tried 扣肉包，salted egg prawn - which are highly recommended. Service is good, staffs are friendly. Good to make reservation if you want to come on the weekend.

It a nice place to meet up with friends to caught up while wrapping the Popiah, we ordered the 12pcs- $37.80 Signature Diy Popiah, average out 1pc about $3.15. It come with the fillings- turnips and carrots in claypot, the condiments- sweet sauce, garlic soil, chilli, lettuce, bean sprouts, shredded omelette and chopped peanuts all in very small portion. The shop shut down the air-con after 9pm on weekday, give a very bad impression to customer as they are chasing the customer away..

Went back so many times and quality of food is always exciting.Service is always not existing, but also not necessary unless the concept will become more ambitious.Ambiance is very basic. Besides seeing the owner with all the celebrities on the displayed photos, never managed to see the owner myself. Hope it works out soon...Nevertheless a great option to have a great meal and definitely will come back..

Been here two nights in a row. Love making my own popiah & introducing some new colleagues to this Singaporean traditional dish.Also ate the ngoh hiang which is very moist & filling. Tonight also tried the fried chicken with prawn paste which went down a treat with the colleagues. If you're in the area do stop by for a tasty meal

Went to the Silat Ave branch. Had high expectations after watching the show on TV but was most disappointed. The popiah was over-rated. The popiah-veg was extremely bland. Tasteless. Not much ingredients. Just veg, shreds of omelette, wilted bean sprouts and lettuce leaves. No shrimp. No crabmeat. Nothing. Over-priced at $20 for 6 popiahs. Frankly, you can get higher quality, more ingredients and lower price at a good VB food court. Extremely disappointed with the TV show promoting this as what was seen on TV was not what was provided

Was recommended to try out after my sis read about it on a food blog. Located along Jalan Bersa road nearby the Jalan Bersa food center. This restaurant is plastered with celebrities photos on their glass windows. Service was indeed slow when they dish out the food one by one. Their so called famous popiah does not taste very local bit overall just average. Fried rice was mediocre and so was the chicken wings. I got to agree with other trip advisors reviews that it just average. However, for those foodies who do not like a "heavy" taste. This is your place.

This was my third time having popiah and other food here. Can see that the popiah vegetables took effort to prepare and the additional order of prawns looked and tasted fresher than my previous visits but it did not taste as nice as my other visits. Considering the price we have to pay, there was a tinge of regret coming. We paid I think about $9 for a plate of fried toufu. It was just sprinkled with some pork floss and to dip with soy sauce with some chopped garlic in the sauce. We thought it would have came with some special dip.Hopefully this feeling of the food not tasting as good is one off.

This is one of the remaining Popiah Restaurant in Singapore whereby you do on your own. Nice and reasonable price

The host and his team usually prepare way ahead for you. You are immediately given your wi-fi access pass code, your room is already set. The welcome can be compared to your family welcoming you back home.

Came here for home cooked food and poh piah and was not disappointed. Poh piah was good and so was the fish maw soup. The prawn paste fried chicken was also nice. Did not enjoy the hokkien noodles as it was bland.

This lunchtime, we went to your Jalan Berseh outlet with my aunt and her english couple friend. This is their first time into asia and was very pleased with your signature dish - Popiah. They have never eaten or seen a DIY dish before you eat. "Ah Boy" was happy to demonstrate on how to make a Popiah. and They could not be any happier. They have great fun in making their own popiah. Certainly a dish to remember. Hot Ginger Tea is just a little too sweet for my taste buds. Else, would have been perfect to wash down that hot chili

My colleagues and I had lunch here on a week day. We took the set menu for 4 which costs slightly over $100. It had fish maw soup, fried vegetables, ngoh hiang, cereal prawn, fried bee hoon, 8 servings of popiah and dessert. They were all tasty, especially the cereal prawn. It was not full when we were there but we suspect that it would be so during dinner time and on weekends. The service was adequate. All in all an enjoyable lunch

Ordered 6 dishes, 1 dessert and some drinks.Pork Trotters Bee Hoon:2/5 - A typical dish in SG home, canned pork trotters with bee Hoon. It tasted saltish and really seemed like using canned pork trotters.Baby Kailan: 4/5 - typical standard from a normal cook food stallClay pot beancurd:4/5 - typical standard from a normal cook food stallCereal coated dice chick:2/5 - chicken does not taste marinated. Chicken dice and cereal seemed to cook separately. Cereal tasted sweet, with no aroma.Stew Pork with Bun:2/5 - personal preference, I don't like. The stew pork too soft with too much sauce. Hokkien Popiah:3/5 - folks who does not take po piah often can try this. The po piah spread has the natural sweetness from vegetables and the aroma from shrimps. Chili tasted great. For those who has a great appreciation for spiciness, do try and spread more on the po piah skin.Yam paste with gingko:1/5 - Dessert served only luke warm. Taste of yam is not strong. Coconut milk tasted like it was served from tetra pack.Red date tea:3/5Ginger tea:5/

Went last night and took a friend from Sydney to try the poh piah. The person who folded the popiah skin did NOT wear gloves, he was also the cashier. I also saw him scratching his forehead. Shocking food hygiene. Food was tasteless, service was appalling. And mind you this is not hawker food price. My advice is STAY AWAY
1
Ordered food for 6... Paid 150.. Portion of popiah was 3 dollars each and taste not to expectation .. Worst than a hawker stall .. 18 dollars to roll ourselves with jacking ingredients.. Rest of dishes so .. So... Nothing perfect than normal zi char.. Only photographs of various media corp artistes.. To capture attention

Passed by this restaurant and saw some celebrities on the windows. Guess it should not be bad. We ordered the famous popiah and other dishes. The portion is small with its slightly high price. We just didn't feel eating enough. Service and atmosphere are ok. It is worth trying the food. It isn't too value for money. I would not go there for the 2nd time

Visited the restaurant on mother's day..What a let-down to our mum..The ambience is poor as the place is very small and crampy n aircon is not cold enough to cater for crowds around 10 big n small tables! Worst of all, the toilet is out of order!!! Its looks like we had visited a restaurant in neighbouring country..After tasted the grandfather's generation popiah years back, thought the taste will still be the same..its really to our disappointment as the bang kwang with mini dried shrimp filling taste a bit sour with too much gravy in it.. Could be due to hot weather..maybe??The fish head & yam soup is just normal..very little fish meat...We ordered mee suah but it turned out to be bee hoon instead! The waitress said will check n get back but never

Used to be much better.

This Hokkien restaurant has been around for more than 30 years and one of the famous dish that appears on every single table is the Popiah. What could be more fun that making our own popiah from the piping hot claypot that is served within five minutes after the table is laid with all the other ingredients. .....julienned bang kwang topped with mini dried prawns were juicy and fragrant.....the skin. The stewed pork is yet another rich and delicious braised dish that comes with the standard white buns ($16). The bonus slices of yam escaped the humdrum of a typical stew pork bun that is stuffed only with lettuce leaf. The Fish Head and Yam soup ($16 for small) did not look inviting but received praises from the tables for its wholesome flavours. The slurry broth is furnished with subtle sweetness from the napa cabbage and yam. And the ....... they had not brush encounter with bubbling oil. But the star of the night is none other than the Pig Trotters Bee Hoon ($14 for small). One can relish......bolster the flavours of this dish. Everyone was obsessed with this dish despite being stuffed to the brim with the earlier dishes.This is a reliable restaurant that you can count on for some wonderful heritage dishes. Just remember to place a reservation in advance especially during weekends if you do not wish to join in the queue. Visit user's blog under profile for full review and pic

Went with family of 8 for lunch. We ordered popiah for 12 servings, noodles, chicken, sea cucumber and vegetables. Service was quick...Food was salty. Price was a little on a high side for the portion served. The cereal chicken is worth trying. The popiah is worth trying IF you have not wrap your own before.

First time I visited this place, it was the meal of my life... the last two times it has been progressively worse... I hate to say that it has deteriorated to average (and expensive for average). Maybe they're just trying to coast by on their name? Can't do it, guys! You've gotta work at it to stay on top.Better popiah at Smith St or Maxwell Rd hawker centers.... (and much cheaper!

Good Chance Popiah is simply riding on her past popularity, no young celebrities visit this place as you can see from those pictures they tried on show off online... and only a handful of old time celebrities 'visited' it, probably once and that's it as the present location is an old housing estate. I stayed exactly a minute away and never returned after my first visit.Now for the hard truths...1. Today, at most foodcourts in shopping centres, you can get a popiah of similar quality at half the price and with lots of other food to choose from at foodcourt.2. Everything here is overpriced. If you're looking for other items in the menu, do note that just across the street is a coffeeshop with an average "zi cha" store that can produce the same quality menu at half the price... and 5mins away is chinatown, it's a food paradise there.3. If you stay around this area, do note that the popiah skin is not as tangy as the one sold in the old Bukit Ho Swee Hawker Centre.... it's also not as tasty those from chinatown..... so....The rental at their current location is dirt cheap.... I know because I've stayed in this estate for 30 years. Yet their prices are ridiculous. So.... beware..... But if they lower their prices, this can be a good alternative for restaurant away from crowded areas...

My family practically grew up patronising this restaurant since I was a kid which has been managed and span across 3 generations of the family to date. As the title suggest, the restaurant serves authentic hokkien cuisine and has kept the original dishes it began with even though new dishes are added onto the menu from time to time. The location of the eatery might have changed over the years, but the taste and standards of the food has maintained the same.Some of its well-know authentic hokkien dishes are popiah, hokkien noodles and prawn roll with sweet sauce dipping. As the name of the restaurant suggest, It is famous for its popiah whereby diners make and roll them with the a combination of ingredients provided. A healthy dish with lots of greens. On top of that, it is one of the very few restaurants that still offers that on their menu. Other delights include prawn paste chicken, deep fried tofu, homemade otah otah, fish with yam soup as well as crayfish dishes, However, I do feel that some of the seafood dishes such as the crayfish are overpriced, and maybe worth a miss.The restaurant is situated under a flat in a mature residential area of Singapore and is popular among older Singaporeans. Atmosphere wise, it is decorated with traditional chinese decorations with photos of local and overseas celebrities patronising the eatery as well as newspaper clippings of the restaurant's coverage in print and visual media. Recommended to young locals as well as foreigners that would like to try a spread of authentic Singaporean Hokkien Cuisine

Went with my mom and sister without reservation two fridays ago. It was just around 6.30pm and the restaurant was full. The staff was polite and ask if we could wait for 15 min. We stayed outside but after 10 min we were seated. It was a first nice impression. Ordered and the food came at a resonable timing. Loved the DIY concept of the popiah! Place may be a little small but overall, we were more than satisfied with the service and food!Excellent and keep up the good work, Good Chance

The service is so terrible when i visit with my family. Firstly most important is the service is not standard as i find the tall guy at the shop serving & taking orders, attidude is very bad and show a bad face as if we consumers own him something whereby we here is to enjoy the food. Secondly the hygiene is not well take care, as i eat i can see a short strand of hair on the bottom of the plate when going to finish the food. Overall this two points is enough for me not to go there anymore. There is far more better food out there and more hygiene in singapore

I do not feel that is a bad service, after reading the review I went down to try the Food, after trying I really feel that it is the best Popiah , U must really go and try it.Ya i agree that the place mostly full house and the staff is busy but they still repreat their order. Maybe they have IMPROVE in this few month. I recommend you to go down and try so u will know how the food and service is like

Dated 4 Jul 2008Today is my 2nd visit to this restaurant together with my hubby and mum. Actually, I am pregnant and have great craving for popiah since a week ago. However, to my disappointment, their service standard was terrible. I reached there at 7.05pm and the restaurant was quite packed. I had asked to take order for at least 3 times before one of the service staff, a bespec young man, approached me. He took order but did not repeat the order.Next, he came with wrong order. I had placed order for 1 no. of medium pot of popiah veg but he came with 1 small pot of popiah veg. When I confronted him, he said that he would send me another small pot of popiah veg. I agreed and reminded him to deliver me the remaining items, fried rice and drinks. About 40 min later, our drinks came and followed by the fried rice. However, there was no sign of another small pot of popiah veg. Again, we reminded him and 2 of the other service staff but seemed to me, there was not much action taken. I was abit puzzled. About another 8 min later, the bespec young man, my order taker, came to me and informed me that we had to wait long for our popiah veg. I asked him how long roughly do we need to wait but he never answer to my question. Instead, he forced me to take something else which was not my preference at all (oily food: I won’t take coz I might puke or feel uncomfortable). Needless to say, I was furious as I never came across “hard selling” in this aspect. He couldn’t even explain clearly to me that why I have to wait so long for my remaining dish as in the 1st place, he gave me the wrong order. He was pushy about other dishes and in the end, I cancelled my remaining order. We left with frustration. I told myself never to patronise in this restaurant again. We paid for food (not cheap, 1 popiah for S$2++) and yet we have to suffer all this nonsense. Just to share……..
