Everything is okay about this restaurant, but they don’t have enough staff. Big place but they only have 3 ppl. Waited one hour for food. Very disappointing.
3
Very nice location esp for dining at night. However, service was lacking due to lack if staff, this could have been better. Food was ok but curry was quite good.
4
Went here for dinner. Their specialty is the fish head curry however we opted to have the butter chicken and the chilly crab. The food had a lot of flavor & was delicious. They offer you a bowl of papadams along with your meal.
5
Strongly recommended if you like to eat curry. And really an authentic curry and I believe the chef from India. The place was suitable to bring friend from oversea to come here and try
5
We had dinner on our last night in Singapore.
Great way to finish our trip.
The flavours were wonderful.
Really a very good curry and reasonably priced.
Only thing is this restaurant is on Dempsey Hill not Little India.

We went there to celebrate after the Singapore marathon.All of us were looking for a good meal, and we were not disappointed.Loved the food and the service. Started with the chicken wing cocktail kebabs, followed by Muthu's Chicken Chukka with Romali Roti, and Palak Paneer. All the dishes were delicious
3
Booking time and table not honoured by them. Made us sit in the open air heat and humidity. Tasty food but 'all served cold'. Upon complaint they picked up the dishes and 're-warmed' them. Such food gets soggy and disintegrates. Re-warmed meat can be upsetting to stomach. The experience was average. Very average
5
One of the best restaurants for Indian Food in Singapore. A very nice environment too. Delicious Food. All the five stars are for the taste. A lot of varieties especially for non-vegetarians. Fish Head Curry and Spicy Mutton Chukka are a must try ones. Soooo Yummy they were. I strongly recommend people to try this place.The only negative thing is that they don't have much varieties in Desserts. They had jus four or five types of Indian desserts
3
A nice environment, high roofs, a little warm in the afternoon! Ordered their papadams, fish, chicken tikka...yum! Butter chicken, prawn masala, lamb vandaloo was tasty. Their paneer, cauliflower and lady fingers were nice. A little disappointed with their signature dish, curry fish head. The curry sauce was nice but the fish was mushy! It wasn't freshly made but I think left too long at the stove before the curry was poured over! The plain, garlic nan and Nasi briyani was good. Price was mid to high
5
We had a lunch here during our action packed Singapore holiday.Their main branch is at Race Course but we went here since it was closer to our hotel on Orchard road.Very nice old world ambiance although the place is new. There is outdoor seating but we chose to sit inside given Singapore's humidity.We ordered a Mutter Paneer and Chicken Chettinad both of which were great. They serve complimentary pappadams and veg sides for all meals which is great. We got cabbage and aubergines sides. The Chicken Chettinad was perfectly spiced and the staff was kind enough to provide us an extra serving of rice free when they noted the rice portion was too small for our Indian preferences.This place is not cheap but cannot be called expensive either. It is good value for money
5
The food was an amazing the mutton was cooked perfectly would love to come back here again with my family !!
5
Awesome lunch...good fish head curry tried for the first time..amazing flavour...nice cosy not in a hurry/crowded place. Would recommend for Good food
3
Say no more. That's why I went, I like their fish head curry. For me a must as part of MY visit to Singapore and very nice too.
Not fine dining but perfectly decent food.
4
I had a nice dinner with a large team. Food was great ! Diverse colleagues coming from India enjoyed the food. We particularly enjoyed the fish head curry that was exceptional !
3
Some like it hot, some are born to be mild, but everyone loves a decent curry.I wouldn’t say that their menu is any better than any other top end Indian restaurant. And the likelihood is that there are fancier, more haute cuisine Indian restaurants in town. If you like the traditional dishes you can find them all here.The biryani rice – fragrant basmati rice cooked with cashew nuts – was tasty and the squid sambal – prepared in a based of chilli and tomatoes, delicious. Just thinking of the wildly luxurious butter chicken – bbq chicken pieces in rich gravy topped with a dash of cream and home churned butter gets me salivating. The serious good dish is the simple but glorious calamari rings. You end up with a well-spiced, rich-tasting plateful of breaded calamari rings fried and served with a dash of paprika. Do not miss it.I am addicted to the butter chicken, even though I suspect it is clogging my arteries as we speak. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
3
This Muthus's Curry is trying to reinvent itself from a rustic banana leaf eatery to an upmarket and fine-dinning style restaurant. They had toned down the spices and I believe it appeals well to many non-Indians especially western customers. It did not quite work for me as Indian food excel with its wonderful spices and pungentness. Service was acceptable. Is more a tourist or Indian food for beginners type restaurant. Expensive.
2
Many of my relatives recommended Muthu’s Curry for a good Indian meal. The decoration was welcoming sadly that the only part of this meal that was not terrible. The man who handed me the menu was unwilling to change the chairs which were wet and claimed all the chairs “were wet,” outraged I pointed out a charge under the shade that was dry. When I was placing the order I was willing to forget the sadly incompetent man that served me. I went ahead and ordered a chicken tikka. The chicken tikka that later sat on my table had strong Chilli powder all over it ruining the overall flavour and even the paratha as way too Chilli based. My throat hurt after that meal. I was very disappointed in Muthu’s
3
I remember going to a Fish Head Curry Restaurant along Serangoon Road many years ago. It was fantastic and it became my Standard. Imagine the perfect combination of the noon heat and piping hot fish head curry and dishes. It was super.This Restaurant is the upscaled version. In this Damsey Hill setting it loses the fire. Off course it has a wine list but it loses out to the fine dining Indian restaurants segment
4
Was at Suntec and you know how crowded the place can be. So we thought since we had a craving for Indian cuisine, why not try Muthu curry. Didn't regret any of it. Loved the palek paneer and the free flow papadum. Will recommend for families and couples to visit!

Dempsey Hill is lovely, particularly at night with its trees hung with lights and assortment of low buildings converted into a wide range of eateries. Judging by the type of car parked outside, it’s also a popular place with the up-and-coming. There’s plenty of parking which is apparently free at night, which is a good thing as it’s not that easy to get to by public transport.Muthu’s is located in a high ceilinged building which was blissfully air-conditioned though most people seemed to be eating outside. Inside is very clean and modern but also a bit soulless. We were shown to a table against the wall but swapped it for one near the window as it was obvious no-one else would be coming.Muthu’s fish head curry came highly recommended so it’s what we had as the fish tikka had run out. We also opted for a flower crab, two jugs of beer and the palak paneer and nans. Service was a little chaotic and the owner was a tad sullen. The food was heavily spiced (apart from the paneer) especially the crab. The two small dishes of complimentary vegetables were a nice touch, but they tasted very much like the fish head curry. Although the small fish head curry was in fact very generous, the portion of paneer was small. The nans were fresh as were the popodoms though they quickly became soggy.At around 22.45 the place was empty and it was obvious they wanted to close. The air conditioning was switched off and the bill was presented without asking for it. The latter came to $136 which isn’t expensive by Swiss standards, but seems rather steep for Singapore and the food we received.I wouldn’t really recommend this place, not with the choice that is out there
4
If you are in for delicious Indian stuff, both vegetarian and non vegetarian, this is the place..Especially their Fishhead curry and chicken Masala are really nice. I also tried the nice chicken cababs.
3
We ordered shrimps, fish curry, goat meat, okra and chicken. Only the okra was excellent. The rest seem to be all the same curry base.
Place was busy and clean. Service was good
1
We use to be great fans of this and another Muthu's branch at Suntec. It is reheated not cooked freshly and the whole meal, apart from the naans tasted tired. Essentially is is Teka Centre quality at four or five times the price.
4
A bit chaotic but nice staff, food is good but a bit pricey- as usual around Dempsey. You walking around Dempsey and craving a fish head curry (and you are not in a hurry) this is a great spot.
4
Great ambience, we as a couple always enjoy being here:)
Good for a dinner date specially for couples,
Reasonable price
Staff are quite friendly
4
Visited Muthu's curry at the Dempsey hill outlet for lunch with around 20 of my colleagues. This was part of our regular team building. Ample choice of food and drinks, as we expected. Good selection of local favourites such as curry fish head and biryanis. There were also a decent variety of North Indian and tandoori dishes. We ordered chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, mutton curry and an assortment of naans. White rice was little sticky, which is not a norm for North Indian cuisine
1
We went there for the Head fish curry which was average at best, curry had nothing special and the fish head didnt taste fresh, the Malabar fish had much better taste but was extremely small in size. I had better Indian food in many places in New York, wouldnt recommend
1
Food did was OK ish, more spicy than tasty, it is pre-cooked and re-heated. We had 2 bottles of water, 2 curry dishes, 2 rice (you are not allowed to share) a rita and a nan bread which came in at just over the S$50 including the 10% service charge. Waiter had to be asked for the change. Will not be going back
4
Tried here for Sunday lunch after years of going to Sammys and I think this is better although the atmosphere at Sammys is hard to beat. Clean and air conditioned, nicer fish head curry (but still not as good as Banana Leaf Apolo) and not as rushed. We loved 'Muthu's Chicken Chukka' nice and spicy dry onion and chilli chicken.Easy parking. Attentive service. Decent and reasonable wine selection. This could be a regular
3
Purists complain that Muthu's fish head curry is no longer the best in Singapore as it once was - we think it's still pretty good - tangy, piquant, with a nice red colour. Other dishes are so-so, served in tiny portions. This branch is clean and 'chi chi', hence favoured by well-off expats and 'new Indians'; others prefer the original branch in Little India. Melancholic diners wishing to relive a 70's atmosphere go to Samy's - also in the Dempsey neighbourhood - the food is no better but better value, there is no air con, and the clientele is much more diverse
3
Nice spacious outlet located on Dempsey's road. It gets really crowded on weekends and special occasions. Majority visited by foreigners (non-Indians). The quality of food here is good and they try to maintain it throughout. Attentive staff. Quiet ambience. Definitely worth a try!
3
Average food with good ambience for seating . Services are ok and not very impressive
Locations is good and on main road just few mtr walk from mrt
5
Great location and place to have a good curry meal. The restaurant is clean and very reasonable price for the quality of the food. We rate Muthu's as one of our favorite Indian curry restaurant.
3
A good place to try Rice and Curry if you are in the Dempsey Hill area.The Mutton Poriyal and Fish Head Curry is superb
4
We prefer this branch over the little India branch. Clean, fast and efficient. Service is good and the food is always reliable. Wish they brought back the crab meat starter which is no longer on menu.
4
Good Spicy Indian Food.
After all these days of South Asian cuisine this is best. The price are quite more but worth it.
4
Waiters were very attentive and the manager gave good recommendations on the mwnu when asked. We will back soon.
3
Walked around Dempsey trying to decide and we stopped here. Been trying different foods every night for a week and decided it was time for some Indian Food. Dempsey is a great location. You will need to grab a cab to get here, public transportation won't do it.MC's sits towards the back and it's a little more quiet and laid back. To sit inside you need reservations but outside is open. We ordered several items and ate family style. Beware of the Chicken 65, we all found ether small bones or portion of knuckle. Eggplant was great. Service was just average.So the food was okay, but there's probably better around at a more reasonable price down in town.
3
We first visited Muthus Restaurant when it was first established and loved the authentic taste and setting. This visit was disappointing. The food was bland with no real Indian flavour. Tasted like canned food that was reheated. Fish head curry was probably the most disappointing. Not the authentic flavour or taste we remember. Caters for mild tastes. Not well spiced at all. Breyani was an absolute joke. Rice was undercooked with 2 pieces of meat in it. No flavour at all. Had to question what we were actually eating!!!Mutton vindaloo was sour, obviously old or an overuse of vinegar as a preservative. Butter chicken was too sweet and again NOT authentic Indian food. If you want authentic Indian food in Singapore, try the food outlets in Teeka Markets
5
Excellent Indian cuisine and great service. Medium priced. I never thought I would go for thier specialty of "fish head soup", but it was excellent. If you like spicy (hot) Indian food, you need to specify too heat it up. The mutton was great but 2 "peppers" on the menu is only medium spicy in my book
4
This is one of our favourite Indian restaurants. It is tucked away in a quiet corner of the former military base in Dempsey Road. Our favourite dishes here include the briyani rice, chicken chukka, stir-fried mysore mutton, fish tikka, and papadum.
2
Reasonable curry taste, fish head not that fantastic , cause its steam and add on curry sauce. Not value for money, but worth trying for first timer. Careful its quite spicy.
5
One of the best restaurants during my trip to Singapore. Service was excellent especially from our hostess Sara. Well done!
4
Naan and chicken gravy is good. Biriyani just ok, not too good. Bit expensive alcohol items. They will close hotel around 10 pm. I went in weekdays. Finally average restaurant.
4
Choice Menu including popular Fish Head Curry is a sought after Indian restaurant at Singapore. Tasty food and good service makes it a right choice for many..
5
This place was cool! The interior was inviting with traditional South Indian elements! Equally awesome was their fare! From masala chicken (tender) to fish head curry (those pineapple slices!!!), this place didn't disappoint a bit. We finished the lunch with a pair of chilled rasagullas and man, it was again delicious! Totally worth a visit, well, many visits indeed!!
3
Loved the paneers -- had the cheese paneer and palek paneer (spinach with cottage cheese). Not a native but loved it nevertheless. The Naan was good too, but all came in really tiny servings. Other than the fact that food portions were tiny, everything else was pretty good.
1
Went for lunch with family at their Dempsey branch. To our disappointment, the service was one of the worst we ever encounter. The manager was walking around but when we asked for additional serve of plain rice, he was completely forgotten about it and we have to wait for more than 10minutes just for plain rice!!! We then asked another waiter and yes this time we got it, but the waiter just put the bowl of rice with annoyed attitude, though we never make any noise or complain! Fishhead curry was very diluted (we had it better at the race course branch). Overall experience was bad..will never return
4
I was a bit apprehensive about trying this place. We had been regulars at their Little India outlet but have stopped going there for a while as (a) its quality had dropped, and (b) there are better alternatives nearby. The Dempsey outlet looks a lot more fancy (and hence, less authentic, perhaps?). However, the food turned out to be quite decent, albeit the chicken masala remains a distant second to the superior one at Banana Leaf Apollo. Other dishes were quite good, although the ras malai dessert was quite a disappointment
3
The locals will tell you that Dempsey is touristy but I could not resist a trip to have some nice Indian food and Muthu's Curry came recommended. Rice, condiments are served. Think I over ordered but loved the hot and fresh fish head curry. So, on my next round- I would stick to the fish head and reduce ordering so much. I enjoyed the food more than the heat
2
This place is nicely located and large.
Food is just soso, if you want great Indian food go i.e. to the rooftop of Mustafa.
Food is much nicer.
Service is average a bit slow.
so overall no reason to come
3
Order a few dishes and Curry fish head. Waited about 15-20 minutes for it to arrive probably due to the holiday weekend, I guessed. Food is quite good due to the various spices added. Services is above average and price is on the high side
3
food was ok, location slightly inaccessible if you dont have a car, service could be better though but food came promptly and fast which was great.
1
We ordered Fish Head Curry here and what a waste of money it was! Very mediocre food at a super high prices. Avoid.
5
Went here twice during my stay, had chicken, lamb, prawn, fish curries, rice, naan, satay, poppadoms, salt lasi, mango kulfi. Great service and fresh food.
5
My wife and I have been regulars at Muthus for about 3 years and introduced friends and relatives to the restaurant on visits to Singapore. The food and service is consistently of good quality at reasonable prices. We will be leaving Singapore soon and will miss the friendly, helpful staff and the delicious dishes we have enjoyed here very much. Thanks Muthus
4
Me and my Friends recently had a visit to Muthu's Curry at Dempsey Hill road Singapore.A very nice Hospitality and good food. i appreciate Mr. Reji the manager of the hotel for his politeness and the way he served my friends and me was so good .Mr . Reji thanks for serving us.. hope to come again with family..
2
I took my leadership team for our dinner. Was shocked and shamed in front of the team. Food is ok - not bad but attitude is pathetic. The senior most person or the manager REJI is the worst. Rotisserie were semi cooked. We complained. He did not find anything wrong and had to push for getting them changed. No clearance of wet tissues, empty glasses or even plates till 15 minutes after we finished. When I asked, was asked by Reji, what is wrong and was justifying. More than poor service of average food the lack of ownership by the senior most made the experience miserable
4
Visited this place twice, recently with my family. The dishes here are generally tasty and delicious if you are into spicy and gravy-heavy food. The papadum is my favourite appetizer!Try the naan and briyani, eat them with tandoori chicken or curry fish head. Include flower crab or the fish if you are into seafood.The service was prompt and ambience is good for any occasions. The price is a little high though.This restaurant sits deep inside demsey hill, so either you drive or get a cab there
5
No better place to enjoy a great Fish Head & Curry meal. It is absolutely great. They also serve many other dishes like a variety of chicken and mutton preparations, Their Chilly crab is avoidable and not worth the cost. Good veg dishes too. Portions are lavish and really worth
4
We frequent Muthus Curry at Dempsey Hill often for Indian food. Their chicken biryani is quiet good and so is their vegetarian dishes. The black daal and the paalak daal both are fabulous. Only wish their portions were a wee bit larger.
3
We were taken here by friends as we did not want an expensive night out. The service was good but the food was average. My meat curry was very dry and my friend's chicken was not what he expected, so we were not over-impressed.
3
Food wise not too bad service reasonable, a little pricy, with most dishes, nothing very special about the dishes, which is available at others but at a Budget price.
4
Good Food, finally tried the Fish head curry, it was good.
Our service was ok, food came lil bit slow, but understandable for 16pax.
Can enjoy with family, friends and colleagues.
5
i am regular at muthus curry.quick service,food awesome!staff are all friendly and attentive.kitchen is very clean that we can see from the mirror.value of food.i will come back.
2
Ordered spring rolls and samosa for entree they were a disgrace, no better and probably were, cheap frozen finger food. The naan bread.......was it? Naan was also processed frozen vacuum packed BUT not fresh. Been living in Singapore for two weeks and finding that restaurants.....some........not all....take people for fools. I'm sure I can find better. Will keep searching
4
How I love to eat indian food while in Singapore. I used to eat in shakuntala's or banana leaf. But then, I tried this and now I have new favorite indian restaurant in Singapore! The taste is light but the spice is still there. Can't describe it just to imagine it, its makes me drolling. I could say that if you like a indian food this place is worth to try
3
we were really looking forward to eating here. A good friend who traveled to Singapore raved about this restaurant. The food IS not all that much better than what's in New York, or any medium size city in the US. The rata is good, but the naan's are just so so
5
This is an amazing place to have best fish head curry. It was yummy and mild spicy, best with rice or plain naan. The atmosphere is great not too fine dining setup. Try the Sri Lankan crab, another great dish. Overall worth for money. Must try at least once
2
Muthu's curry has been around for some time and their signature curry fish head is one of the best in Singapore. They serve reasonably good Indian food, tried the chicken kebabs, Tikka, Tandoori, squid, curry mutton, Naan breads, briyani etc. However the service staff at Dempsey outlet are not attentive and stretched. It is very difficult to get their attention even on a regular weekday evening. Even when alerted, they do not seem to provide a good service standard. Food and drinks take a long time to arrive. I would recommend the Race Course Road outlet for better and more attentive service. I have been to Dempsey outlet twice and the service is indeed not up to expectations on both counts
4
This is a nice South Indian restaurant . There are so many in singapore to choose from . The sambar is tasty so clients keep coming back .
4
muthu's curry is an institution. go early to avoid the crowd. we love the briyani rice and chicken curry, mutton and fried fish. try the liver if you are more adventurous.
3
Had a pleasent dinner. The price is decent for a location like this. The food is good , I cant say much as i dont eat indian food often. I was not disppointed with the taste. The tea is expensive in my view.
4
I have dined here twice in recent years with business colleagues. Sitting outside on a warm evening is a great experience. The food portions are modest but the flavors wonderful. Especially the aloo Gobi.
Love it.
5
love the taste. I stayed 3 days in Singa and every dinner and a lunch was taken there. what an amazing place. superb service and the dishes are awsm. you have to try their special and the potato curry. I need it more
3
We had an overcooked pomfret with sambal. Bleh! The prawns somewhat redeemed the experience. Nice choice of meat curries but the vegetable selection was lacking. Nice mango lassi.
5
Had the fish head curry. Portions are HUGE! we ordered a small and the curry with rice was plenty for 2 people. The curry tasted fantastic. It is amazing how much meat there was on just the head.
4
Environment and food is fantastic here. You must try at least once at Singapore. Service quality is very prompt and stuffs are also well behaved. Ms. Sara served us well with her sweet smile and Mr. Narayan helped my wife when she try to arrrange a surprisre candle light dinner for me at abrode. As we first at Singapore. So, thanks to MC for all.... ☺☺
5
I thorough enjoyed the meals I had on the two days I visited the restaurant.Great food and excellent service. I personally thank Raji who took the trouble to debone the fabulous Fish Head Curry; as this was the first time I was trying out this dish.Loved the dessert; pistachio kulfi.My thanks to all the servers and cooks.
4
Had a very good dinner at this places. We stated with chicken wing from the Tandoor (highly recommendable) and a mixed platter of Indian starters (Samosa, spring rolls, potato wedges and squit). Main was Chicken Tikka massala, Fish platter (very spicy but great) and the Chefs special (Chicken). Ambiance not Indian like and a bit steriel but the food definitely makes up for it. No plates but a banana leave as it should be
2
Disappointing For vegetarians; be it the plain biryani or the mutter masala i ordered, was not good.
5
Very good service and nice taste.Biryani is very good. Parking availability is limited. Staff is nice and kind. Very good hotel.
4
Really great traditional Indian food. they serve really, really good Indian food with the spice and the chutneys. The service is amazing and of course the food is fabulous. The staff is friendly and quick. A great place is your looking for traditional Indian food and spicy food. Tip: If you want extra spice then order some chillies (their green chillies are amazing and super spicy.
5
I like the prawns side dish and the mutton briyani. the briyani is so gd to eat. delicious food. AT that time I was alone and was shopping around tekka area. I was talking with my friend on the hp when I spotted the restaurant. it was not that crowded. I ike the politeness of the staff. There were waiters and waitress. They were busy talking with the customers. The ambience was wonderful. I also feel that anybody can dine in teh restaurant. It welcomes all. I spotted a family and some busy business professionals dining at the outlet
5
I am a frequent visitor at the dempsey hill branch and have always had a great dining experience. The staff is extremely cordial and polite. The service is very prompt and good and the food is unlike other indian restaurant food - less oily and spicy. Do try the mango kulfi - its a must have!
4
We have started a Curry Club in Singapore this was our second restaurant. The food was exceptional some really good taste and something to suit everyone at the table. A diverse menu and extremely well priced and good portions. The service was exceptional even to the point of assisting to get cabs even though it was closing time. We will definitely be back and they are good at serving large groups. Thank yo
5
I had dined at many restraurants but never thought of writing a review. My last visit to this restaurant forced me to write a review about our dinner. This was my first visit to muthus curry & I am truly happy that I did. The variety, taste,choice of items on the menu and the price are all favourable for the customer and the quality level was just amazing.It was a closing time when I reached for a late night dinner and was welcomed by their staff (Mr.Visu and his Team)as a family member. They served me a fish curry of my choice. What a curry it was. Texture ,colour, and taste everything was perfect. Each member of staff seems to be very happy with their work and I enjoyed talking to them..my advise , try fish head curry here 
5
This was a special treat for my DAD for the special "FATHERS DAY".Everything is marvellous service, ambiance, and the excellent food.every single order is taking care By the young staff, every single Pinch of food is AMAZING,Really this Restaurant made our day a memorable one.I really like the dishes they served they were really really nice,I cannot say enough about the dining experience we had, Service is at its best.The manners of the staff are the best I've seen anywhere.Thanks for the great experienc
1
We are regular of the Muthu Curry joint, especially the one at Dempsey. Today we had a very Disappointing experience. Was there with close family to celebrate Father's Day & A Birthday. At the end we intended to cut a Cake but the staff SWITCHED OFF THE LIGHTS & AIR - CON. This is display or rude, unpleasant and unhospitable behavior harbored by the staff of a reputable Food Joint.Also, they had poured soap water which was thankful noticed by us. We carefully walked our old relatives out avoiding any possible accidents.Display of totally irresponsible attitude by the staff.They need to work on grooming their staff towards being considerate, welcoming and accomodating towards patrons as a whole or they will loose all credibility. Seriously a good Food joint with rather very very unhospitable, irresponsible and rude staff which just leaves the dinners disappointed with BAD EXPERIENCE no matter HOW TASTY the food!
2
I visited this restaurant with my friends from oversea. We arrived around 8pm, dinner peak-time. We waited drink 30 mins and asked staffs to serve a few times. However they didn't bring our drink even though they said OK. After 30 mins (totally 1 hour), they brought our dishes. I think they took too long time to serve Indian food. The lamps were switched off when we haven't finished our dinner. We had a dinner at a darker place. I felt really sorry for my friends, because they had uncomfortable time at the restaurant.The fish head curry was nice taste. Compared with Banana leaf apolo, it was a bit more spicy and sour. appetizer plate was OK. Deep fried dumplings was not juicy due to slowly serving. If it was hot, taste would be more delicious
5
Don't understand the reviews about bad service. We found it very prompt and friendly. Had a great meal!! Very interesting building and just perfect. We were looking for a different Indian restaurant, but we so happy we stumbled upon Muthu's Curry.
4
Simple and clean with helpful staff. Great Crab curry and Biryani. Loved the Fish tikka. Nicely flavoured and washed with good South Indian coffee.
3
Just another good Indian restaurant. Came here with friends for catch up & enjoy Indian food. Affordable price 👍👍👍👍
5
This has been by far the best curry we have eaten in Singapore...
Absolutely fabulous... totally delicious and tasty food and great service... the veggie curry was probably one of the best veggie curries we've ever had...
LOVED IT :-)
5
Great location, great value for fresh food, must try the yoghurt raita. Generously served with a heart not with mathematics like most singapore restaurants... A must try...
5
We feel in love with the fish head curry at our 1st visit on its old location was at little india the side dishes was good and so with the main dish of fish head curry with the big white puff chips. The price was understandable average as you need to think your paying for fresh food in a 1st world country
4
Went to there with Japanese friends. Our target was traditional fish head curry. We ate it,crab meat,Biriyani rice and vegetable menu(forget the name). Fish head curry was very big even middle size. We were satified with it. Crab meat was too spicy for us but another foods were excelent with drinking Tiger beer. Suprisingly total price was dicent. Do not need to be careful so much for the price and it is possible to be full with satisfaction. It is recomendable to visit early time like 6PM-7PM for dinner in weekend
5
Excellent Food and they given a very nice service , we thought of having lunch in an Indian restaurantthis week so we finally found muthu curry it was our first visit the service is fast and good and also especially we liked their mouth watering fish head curry and like the india dessert as well i think the person name is vinay he is so friendly and very fast guy and given good and prompt service so defntly next week i will come with my family thanks to muthus tea
2
Decided to try out Muthu's Curry. We had initially intended to go Samy's Curry but unfortunately closed. Food served nothing to shout. Average normal Indian Restaurant. I bet those in Serangoon Road smaller shops are better. Service sucks. Ask for rice to be replenished but till finished my meal, that never come. Definitely not coming bac
4
10 years back i have visited muthus curry along with my family at race course road.last sunday i had a chance to have dinner at dempsey road muthus curry.we sat in the garden. Ambience was excellent.The garden was very clean and maintained neatly.Mr.Visu and Mr.sanoj served us with pleasant smile.they have recommended many new items.Dinner absolutely fantastic that i have never encountered.Truly worth many more times to go
3
It's a nice place. Curry fish head is not that bad. But we had to keep asking for side dishes which were cold. Service was so so.
4
Nice location, good choice of tasty dishes and cold beer. Whilst the service isnt the best Muthu's is a good place to enjoy an authentic Indian meal.
2
Food quality is below average and the expansion in the number of outlets ha degraded quality of food.
Between the two of us we Had three dishes with one being average, one abominable and the third passably edible.

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Food was tepid, rice was cold, curry was tasteless, chef could not add spice apparently. Very disappointing. Only good thing is nice setting outside and decor in but it's s restaurants hence food is primary and food was terrible. Never again: go to Mustard or Aromas of India for similar priced but amazing quality indian fare.
3
We came here for a Sunday lunch and to be honest the food was excellent. Unfortunately however it seems they are not making enough profit as the waiter who served us pushed us into ordering more dishes than we actually wanted, with the excuse that all the dishes we had chosen were 'dry' ones and we therefore needed to add some 'wet' curries that we didn't particularly want. The end result was that there was quite a lot of wasted food left on the table and we were charged far too much for what could otherwise have been a very pleasant meal. We left feeling distinctly ripped off and will certainly not be returning
2
Set in a fantastic setting, this restaurant could be a star. The evening was ruined by poor service, not by isolated persons but all. The staff were uninterested and unhappy to be there and not all attentive to the customer. Food was average but well presented
4
If you get to this place early,and if the weather permits, I would strongly advice sitting outside the restaurant and just enjoying the open fresh air, nice surroundings and excellent food! Personal tip - try their Fish Head Curry, Calamari Rings & Pepper Masala Dry Chicken - it's good stuff!And they do serve beer, which goes along well with spicy food
4
Beautifully located along the lobby around fountain of wealth, gives a fabulous ambience for quite singaporean-indian food. To my utter surprise, the Tandoori chicken ordered was fabulous. The taste was awesome. Though at 8 PM, the chicken biryani was already over so we had to suffice with Mutton biryani. Taste was OK, i found the mutton wasn't cooked properly. Glass of white wine can have some more wine in the glass. Not value for the money in terms of wine glass. Overall a good experience apart from some obvious flaws. With unlimited servings of papadum you can still enjoy your drinks with minimum food order. Worth a visit
3
The food at Muthus curry is quite tasty. However the drawback is that they are over priced especially for budget travellers. Both the veg and non veg fare tastes good and they are famous for the fish head curry which costs around 30$. A good advantage is that the servings of papad is unlimited. Be prepared to shell anything between 50-80$ for a good filling mea

I just had pineapple Lamb chops here, the texture and the flavour were out of this world. I could have eaten 6 or more. Excellent spicing made them the best I have ever eaten. Good garlic naans and sheekkebabs on the side made the whole experience worthwhile
5
Fish Head is Delicacy here, one would love to have it ! again and again. the hotel has fantastic ambience, service is superb, the quantity is more for one.... tummy full !
4
I went to the Muthu's in Suntec city and thought it was great. Here on a business trip and at there twice in one week. Great food, enjoyed the guys working there and would go back right now if I could.
3
Northern Indian cuisine, reasonably well prepared, but the most enjoyable dish was the naan bread. The rice was nicely fluffy and separated, but the rest of the dishes were forgettable (not bad, just not memorable). Service was prompt.
5
Could not have picked a better place for fine Indian food, the open chef station is great to watch while they prepare your dishes too. Excellent food, nice atmosphere too and friendly waiters.
4
Eat Sea food at Muthu's curry than Chicken and all other stuff. If you are RCI platinum Plus member please don't ask for discount as promised by Dining Plus you will get frustating treatment which is annoying.
3
The place is rather kind of fast food. Service is quite nice taking into consideration fast food - for restaurant is not acceptable. The food is really average and prepare in advance so impression is not good. Although I have to admitt that it is not really bad. Place is just not good not bad so You have to decide by Your own
5
The service is prompt and orderly. Other than been a picky foodie. Personable service from Narayan. He demonstrated it through a happy smile and is very polite, asking how the food is and he asked if I need additional serving of vegetables. and he is swift while multitasking - I got my food packed as i am unable to finish the few dishes that I ordered. Look out for him while you are there.The ambience is cosy. Great place to dine in. Thumbs up

'Just dined at Muthu's Curry after a long day of travel and then several hours of shopping at Suntec City Mall. Just two words: authentic, delicious. This spot is located in restaurant section of the mall and features a simple venue for hungry shoppers and in this case, curry lovers.I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala with fresh naan breads and after consuming the nice-sized portion, found myself scraping the curry bowl for a few last savory memories. Clearly, Muthu's knows how to make a deep, subtle and flavorful curry.I glanced at their business card upon my departure and noted that there are three locations in Singapore so I suspect they are doing well by serving quality food, backed with good service. Give the shopping at Suntec your best, then plan to have an authentic Indian Curry at Muthu's. (going back tomorrow night

This is a review of the restaurant's outlet at Suntec City Mall. Though Muthu's Curry is well-known for its fish head curry, I'd ordered their Malabar Fish Curry ($12) instead for my family as I've a preference for fish meat with bones removed. The dish turned out to be excellent, full of flavour without being overwhelmingly spicy with generous pieces of fish meat that melts in the mouth. The Fish Tikka ($11) which we ordered was grilled to perfection, and so was the Tandoori Chicken ($13). The Paalak Paneer ($9) was a surprise to us. The waiter had recommended it after I consulted him about a nice green vegetable dish. So imagine our surprise when we were served a small bowl of green gluey looking liquid. My husband gamely took a sip and said it was like drinking thick spinach soup. Overall it did not taste too bad but still was not quite palatable to me as I like to eat my vegetable, not drink it!The Biryani Rice ($4 per portion) is fragrant and moist. We also ordered the assorted Naan Basket ($14) which consist of three different types of naan - plain, herb and cheese. The different variety of naans can also be ordered individually. Meals are served with complimentary side dishes like curried eggplant and potatoes. The orange juice is quite expensive though at $6 per glass. All prices are subject to 10%service charge and 7%GST.The outlet at Suntec City is big and usually not crowded so it is often easy to get a table even during weekends. Service though can be slow. While waiting for the food to be served, customers with children can keep their young ones entertained by having a look at the naan and tandoori cooking counters as the kitchen is open to view with a glass panel
4
Enjoyed a delicious lunch here, curries, naan bread and a yummy mango lassi. It was very busy however service was fast and thus it is not a place I would go for a dining experience. Saying that for a lunch whilst one is exploring Singapore it is perfect
4
Muthu's curry passes itself off as an indian restaurant and to an extent this is true but it comes with strong Singaporean influences.
The fish head curry is recommend here.
5
Professional staff but very friendly for foreigners too.
Needless to say taste is great!!
When u are in Singapore must gooo!!!!
かれこれ4年前、シンガポールに住んでたころ興味本位でリトルインディアに行ってみたらこのムツカリーに出会った。もともとインドカレーが好きな私にとっても申し分無い味で、海外の食事が苦手な方でも、店の雰囲気含め満足できるだろう。。。
日本のメディアでもよく取り上げられているみたいで、フィッシュヘッドカリーは絶品である。
またスタッフが気さくな方でこっちにきて初めての行きつけの店となり、シンガポールでの思い出の店でもある。。。
皆さんもチキンライスやマックのチリソースに飽きたらぜひ行ってみて下さい!!
PS味があんまりないポテチみたいなやつは食べ放題ですw

I went to Muthu`s Curry in Little India (not in Dempsey, but it`s the same chain). I had Butter Chicken, and it`s the best butter chicken I ever had. I highly recommend this restaurant, and I`m definitly going to try the one in Dempsey Hill.
5
I'm very happy to have eaten in this restaurant, food was very tasty and service efficient. A bit disappointed for the fact that you have to pay for extra napkins but in general I had a very good experience. Also quite cheap
5
Fish Head Curry with a nice thick curry gravy and free flow of papadum ;)The curry gravy has a nice thick consistency with enough ladies fingers, other restaurants we patronised couldn't compare. They have a live naan and tandoori cooking station. The plain and briyani basmati rice are cooked well and fluffy. We finished off dinner with a good masala tea.Service is also efficient, friendly and quick. The service staff have a good attitude. Parking is also easy, just in front of the restaurant but it is hard to find a space during peak hours.We will be back for more...definitely
5
Muthu's Curry will never disappoint you, they have dishes for all age groups and for all types of taste buds, we have been going there almost every week since last 6-7 months and have never got disappointed.Must try Dishes: Lamb Chops, Malabar Fish Curry, Afghani Chicken Kebabs, Fish Head Curry, Egg Bhurji, Chicken Masala and Rumali roti. The Rumali Roti is the best ever Rumali roti one can taste. My Daughter is in love with the Butter Chicken at Muthu's, she never orders anything other than Butter Chicken, with Butter Naan and rice.Ras Malai is made fresh daily and this is also a must try dish, go there in big groups so that you get to savour all the dishes that I've mentioned. Staff is very friendly and hospitable
4
This is a nice curry house with some really authentic dishes and some waiters with incredible memory. We gave quite a long list of dishes and all were remembered and delivered quickly. The prawn dish, featured in one a Madhur Jaffrey's books is as good as she describes. Worth a visi
5
We loved the food . The flavors were amazing . If you can handle a descent spice level - this is a place you got to eat . This recommendation comes from a indian family . We ate there 3 times in a week . !!!
4
I found this restaurant quite authentic. We had nice samosas, flower crab (good) and curried mutton (good), but the best was the Tandoori Fish Head, a superb chunk of sea bass cocked to perfection with a tasty spicy sauce. Good mango lassi. Service was quick - while the waiter told us that the wait for the fish was 30 minutes, it arrived after about 15 minutes - but quite indifferent, a little more enthusiasm would help. They have just one Indian beer (Kingfisher). Slightly on the expensive side for local standards. On the whole, quite recommendable
4
very prompt, affordable, services. Also at Suntec Mall (food court).a good fill esp is shoppin at this mall & post dinner, directly to ur room for a good sleep. If not very busy, a request for a crisp chilli garlic naan (spicy!!!) is best served here
4
Went with a group for an office lunch, and though the restaurant was quiet (I understand it's lively in the evenings), the Indian food was the best i have had in three years in Singapore. I will go again.
4
Very good meal and good prices. Rate the fish head curry as better then Sammy's at Dempsey hill. Plenty of room and good service.
4
Went there only for curry fish head. And that was excellent. Very spicy, very tasty, very plenty. Highly recommended.
4
Nice service.. food portion a bit small for the price.. restaurant also very beautiful. The roti naan is nice, tandoori chicken is nice too..
5
Great indian food, great service, great ambience and very friendly staff taking care of the guests. I will definitely repeat the experience when back to Singapore! Dario (Italy)
5
I've been going regularly to 2 branches of Muthus for the best part of 4 years and they deserve some credit on TA. They have been consistently good for years and kept the prices sensible- Good authentic curry menu all around the $10-12 mark, includes classics and some home-styles ones. Good range of dhal, break and rice as well. All served on banana leaf plates- Wine selection isn't great, but the beer is sensibly priced. They have an unusual starters menu (includes spring rolls etc) and above average desserts.- The service is kind and friendly - with a price tag to match. Much better than the impersonal-borderline-rude service of most of their competitors around Race Course Rd. - Dempsey Hill outlet seems a little more special - the menu and service is consistent. Would suit a birthday if you are looking for a more relaxed experience, sit outside. Thanks again Team Muthu'
4
We enjoy fiery food and Muthu's Curry marks the menu to denote heat.The flavors are an authentic match to foods we ate in India. The curry sauce of the prawn dish is superb. We had palek paneer, chicken masala, black dal, the very large prawns the size of langoustines, and lots of garlic naan and pappadums. We brought our own wine and there is a corkage fee of S$30.00. The food prices are modest for the Dempsey Hill area.The wait staff is excellent and they were attentive without being intrusive.We will definitely be going back because of the authentic taste.
4
I ordered the prawn masala. It's expensive - $7 per prawn. But the prawns are the size of langoustines. The masala was rich and delicious. Worth it! Good service. All meals are served with veggies on the side (cabbage and aubergines). All the food was good with the exception of the veg samoosas which I found a bit bland. But the standard is good and unlike many Indian restaurants, the curries don't all taste as though they are made from the same base, they are all different. The garden area is quite smoky, and the inside is very cold, so we chose a non-smoking table outside under the awning
4
Received good service and the food lived up to my expectation. Not a food connoiseur but loved the food taste. Tried the fish head curry which it is popular for and liked it very much. You tend to sweat a bit though, but fish curries are meant to be hot. Must eat
5
i went to muthus on last wednesday it was a very nice evening which i have spent on dempsey hills muthus with my indian collegues , the food and the service was really great and we sat on outside, the weather and the seating was nice, we ordered a sea food sizzler it was really great and the lamb rack is delicious but we only disappointed with the MUTTON VINDALU (the mutton was not good the pieces are too hard and less meat pieces) and the service was good and speedy service by Vinay the only thing is we went over there very late @9pm i dnt knw its goin to close at 10pmThanks to Muthus Team By making my day Memorabl
4
Muthu Curry's Crab curry is one of the best i have tasted so far. It's made of special spices and have a unique taste. plus it's value for your money,
4
Coming back from india i wanted to taste the indian food option in singapore. So i visited this place. Food is good specially south indian dishes. Price ok. Service is slow. Can repeate any time
4
For starters, we had the potato wedges and crispy okra. The actual taste did not match the description in the menu. We expected more flavors. For the main course, we had Mysore Mutton, Malabar fish curry, chicken vindaloo and yogurt. The Mysore Mutton was the best dish of the three. The Malabar fish curry was too creamy for my taste. The yogurt was strained well that the texture was like 'labneh' (consistency of soft cheese). We also had plain briyani which tasted quite good with the side dishes we ordered. However, I must say I was very dissapointed with the service. The service was not only slow, but the waiter had forgotten to serve us our full order. As we were seated outside, it was quite difficult to get the waiter's attention as they preferred to stay indoors. We had our meal on a Saturday afternoon (low occupancy). I can imagine the quality of service when the place is full! My BIL who frequents this place also stated that their service has consistently been poor. Something the management should improve on
4
I have been lucky to visit this restaurant on a few occasions when in Spore and it always exceeds my expectations. The gravy of the curries are unique to south Asian culture and in particular Indian cuisine. It is very different to those you would get back in the UK. The fish head curry, a national dish of Singapore, is always excellent. Piping hot and you can select the size of the head too. Don't be put off by this as the head contains allot of meat and my wife Singaporean wife absolutely loves the fish eye's. On my most recent visit, we also tried the Fried Okra and the Chicken Chettinad which again was very good. I do have to mention though as with most places in Spore the price on Alcohol is high so a few beers with your meal will easily set you back at least Â£10. I would also suggest the staff adopt a more hospitable approach and maybe somebody greeting at the door and asking how the meal is would be great, apart from this I would definitely visit again on my next trip
4
I'll be honest.. I'm not a big fan of all the dishes at Muthu's.. But this particular complete-meal-in-a-little-pot is a BIG WINNER! It's also probably not the healthiest of options, but boy does it go all the way down happy! Layer upon layer of flavours and super hearty meal for S$12
4
Went there with colleagues and it was worth the visit, although i only ate curry with rice and a little bit of fish from the fish head but it was good and the smell stays on your hand and last for a day or two, depending on how often you wash your hand. :) Thought that it is quite reasonably priced and place can get crowded in the evening, you might have to make a reservation
2
I'm a big fan of Muthus and frequent the Racecourse Road outlet frequently. I will not however be returning to the Suntec City branch anytime soon. The service was so appalling it basically destroyed our meal.Countless times we asked where our drinks and food were only to be met with blank expressions and shrugs of shoulders.I won't be going back, was the worst service I have had in years and I truly don't wish to exaggerate
4
We went inside reluctantly but the service was great as we went in for lunch as we were inside the restaurant the stewards took care of my parents immediately inquiring about there health the type of food they liked etc .The food was tasty they have a see through kitchen the stewards are good the atmosphere pleasant and the food was good no regrets and to top it they served my father the masala chaas ..which was without Ice and perfect where else at this lunch hour Singapore .
3
Started off with a waiter who did not seem to understand us. Fortunately he was replaced without any request from us. Food was OK, not served steaming hot as I expected. Taste was averageNot expensive, very affordable. Review would have been better if the food was warmer
4
Had been to this place for a business dinner with a group of about 12 people, well arranged, wide variety for those enjoy non-vegetarian Indian cuisine, has choice for veg menu as well. Nice ambience. Service could be better when they have more customers walking in, specially for those with large groups and reservation done
4
Excellent restaurant to get-together with family and friends or to eat by oneself. Curried and fried chicken, mutton and fish are very good. Tends to be crowded during weekend evenings but one may reserve a table.
2
ordered medium fish head curry on a weekday night, gravy wasn't heated up at all(room temperature), taste was sub par, spices were way too strong and not balanced, quite "one note" taste(of strong spice), very little complexity. for the price there are many other options which offer better taste(eg. try Indian Curry House at Bt Timah).ordered mango lassi but could get strong taste of pineapple juice instead. Mango lassi tasted more like plain fruit juice than a yoghurt based drink.Gulab Jamun dessert was just average, lacked "oomph".Pistacchio Khulfi was interesting, but would probably never order again due to the price.Service was quite good, with the exception that I had to ask for my bill more about 4 times before it was finally delivered to me(waited more than 10mins for it)
4
If you are looking for a quality curry in Singapore Muthu's is a great choice. Had a very enjoyable lunch here and the dish that actually stood out the most was the Chicken tikka. I am actually more of a mutton fan and would say the chicken was a better choice. Overall the curry was tasty and the fish curry was also well prepared.The seating indoors is a very small area, but very nice atmosphere. I would give it a try and also give the chicken byrani rice a go, very nice
5
Excellent service by Mr, Narayan. Good food goes along with good wine.. I was hungry for Indian food for many years after being in Vietnam for 2years. Mr. Narayan really took good care of me and the service is outstanding!!! Weldone Mr. Narayan keep up the good job
5
I've thought of going to this restaurant many times but could never make it until last week. It was one of the best experience I've had in a long time. Initially I was circumspect on trying the fish head curry which is their signature dish but damn it was so yummy. The vegetables served with the rice r super fresh and super tasty. I also tried the cuttle fish rings and chicken chukka and those dishes were also nice. I feel it's a bit overpriced but yeah I'd definitely go again
4
Excellent place for Indian specially South Indian curries. The house special Muthus Choosa, a spicy chicken dumplings in a house spicy is not to be missed. The fish is excellent. The ambience is good and so is the service which is very friendly. Clearly a favourite with the locals. The pricing is also reasonable. A not to miss for those who savour cheetinad style food.
4
Muthu's has either moved from the racecourse or opened a new branch at Dempsey. We ate at Dempsey.Very good quality food and good quantities: we couldn't eat it all. Food probably hotter, in the spiced sense, than most Indian restaurants in UK, so if you don't want it too hot, best to go for the one chilli symbol than the two chilli symbol. Very reasonable prices - $S40 per person including beers
4
i think the title says its all. A good selection of dishes and all enjoyable. This place has been added to the list of restaurants we will revisit when we are next in Singapore (actually i liked it so much, i want to go their again the next night but my wife said no!
5
The service was wonderful, I wish I could remember our servers name - however, he was very attentive, helpful and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble and his recommendations were fantastic! The food was excellent, the ambiance great and prices very very reasonable i thought. I will be recommending this restaurant and look forward to coming back again
2
This was recommended as a good Indian Restaurant. Don't bother, it is cafeteria style, sort of. All food is prepared ahead of time and sitting in trays under the glass, like a cafeteria. You order off a menu and it is delivered, but sub par food.
4
Wow......get me that Tiger and a wet towel....yummy....The spices and the fish head curry......and the rice and papadums...........and then long snooze in a cool room on a Sunday afternoon.
4
Very nice quality and tasty food available, very close to Farrer Park MRT, ambiance is also good but around that place there are more and better options are available for example Khansama, Jungle Tandoori, Kailash Parbhat etc
5
Had lunch here with friends who live locally and wanted us to try the famous fish head curry - it lived up to our expectations! Excellent staff and service and really good South Indian food. Can also recommend the lime juice and the mango lassi.
4
This place was recommended by friends, its was either this or The Banana Leaf Apolo. Both restaurant will not disappoint in the food section. The 2 restaurant offer dining service experience and interior design. As beauty lies in the eye's of the beholder for the old SG atmosphere, I would award The Banana Leaf Apolo. I was informed of the huge demand for Fish Head Curry daily, it sadden me to think of, I don't know if Red snapper will be move to the endangered species list and perhaps fish scientist and farmers should be funded to work harder. Relax cause Fish Head Curry with any other fish just isn't the same
4
Whilst visiting Singapore we visited Muthus Curry, racecourse restaurant, wi friends who guided us as to where was good to eat in Little India. The food was fantastic! We thoroughly enjoyed the starters and main courses. The popadoms were a little stale by the time we came to eat them but I think that is more of a reflection of the environment in Singapore than the quality in the restaurant!Eating off banana leaves was novel, we were just so pleased they provided cutlery as eating with our hands would have been a cultural step too far for us!Mutton curry was a first for us and was delightful. So was the Butter chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala which was surprisingly spicy, but very enjoyable. We can't comment on the price for our friends insisted on paying as we were their guests! Overall, great food and decent restaurant. The 5th star was lost because we did think the staff could have been a little friendlier, we are clearly tourists but just not given a welcome or treatment we thought we may have
4
I went to the Race Course branch with my friends yesterday. It was Sunday full fledged lunch. We ordered our favorite fish head curry , masala chicken, mutton chops and some naans to go with. The fish was fresh,tasty and spicy as always.My friends just loved the mutton chops which were soft and tender. The service was prompt and friendly. We paid around 100 plus. But it was value for money as we left satisfied
3
I went with friends to the branch at Dempsey Road. We ordered the recommended reviewed Fish head curry, with others: chicken tikka massala, Mango lassi, and rice.The fish head curry was average. The same taste can be found in many places in Singapore. The chicken tikka masala is quite nice, on the spicy side. The Lassi mango is sour, go for frozen one would taste better. Rice comes with free flow veggie. The cabbage is nice.The ambience is very nice. But the price is on high side. I would recommend the same menu at Dawaat Tandorri at Upper Thomson but less pricey and better cooked
1
I love indian food- that's why i m here...honestly food is good in general, however i couldnt imagine i stood in front of their staff for 25mins at the front door, and no one attend to us until i made a complain to get a seat...posh place, bad service. No way for me.
3
The ambience is porsh. but service is bad n they dont understand what does indian food means. They dont even serve the 3 main vege's which should come in the banana leaf. Everything is chargable. Plus if you were to ask water they just take their own sweet time to serve them. I think the staff there serve the foreigners more delightfully than the locals. I definitely wouldnt want to go there anymore,. Twice my experience sucks.
4
One of the original indian restaurants in the area has become too much upmarket. It has lost it's original charm. The food is good but I would prefer banana leaf apolo a few houses away. But this is more modern and may be a suitable place to bring business clients who may prefer to have a plate instead of a banana leaf.
4
Love this place. Food is awesome, staff respond and the ambience is cool. Parking can be a real pain but it is worth it. Must try the chicken tikka
4
I very rarely eat Indian food outside of home (coming from Hong Kong!), but this was a pleasant treat. The place was kinda fancy for an Indian joint (served wine!), but the spice level was great. And yes, better than Samy's!
4
We just went to dinner at Muthu's and had the butter chicken, black dahl and sag paneer. Everything was so fragrant and delicious. The butter chicken was the highlight, really very yummy. The atmosphere inside is a bit lacking and if its a mild night, outside is a great spot. Teh service was really very good and very polite. the restaurant was quiet so the waiters were quite attentive. They also helped select dishes, which ended up great. really enjoyed this place for a casual beer and a good tasty dinner
1
My husband and I were on the lookout for a relaxed evening dinner after a nice movie and after walking on race course road picked muthu's. One of the reasons we chose this place was that it was quite full and we saw quite a few indians as well. This i thought would be an assurance that we would get authentic indian food. The service to start off with was very rushed and not very polite. We did arrive at the restaurant at quarter to ten and were told to order quickly for the last order. After being told that several items were not available we finally asked them to recommend what was available. The food came along and we ordered a spicy prawn dish and chicken tikka. The chicken tikka looked like it had just been thrown on the plate. It was spicy but the chicken was not fresh. It felt like they had just reheated some pieces of meat. The prawn masala again was spicy but the prawns were overcooked and hard. We were ready to forgive all the rushed service and the not so authentic food but the icing on the cake was that they billed us for extra items we did not have!! I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone. I was surprised to see that so many Indians frequent this place. Just because the food is "spicy" does not make it indian
5
We first went to Muthu's in Singapore's Little India 20 years ago when the FIsh Head curry outshone the very basic surroundings including having curries splodged on to a banana leaf on a bar table without any ceremony.Now it is all marble and glass and the banana leaf comes on a special rectangular plate, but still great old-fashioned curries with authentic South Indian flavours including two versions of the famous fish head curry. Prices for food and drinks are very reasonable. A mecca for curry lovers visiting Singapore
4
We happened upon this restaurant by chance (Dempsey Hill branch) & what a find!The food is delicious & reasonably priced too. The 4 of us ate & drank for half of what we have spent at other Singapore restaurants. The wine was good & the beer cheap.The location was lovely as we ate outside in the garden, with candles & fairy lights.We will definitely be back
4
Yes it's a bit of a cliche maybe and yes it's a chain now but Muthus never disappoints. The food and service are always of a good quality, the beers are cold and so many people every hour of every day just can't be wrong can they? Muthus does exactly what you would expect, just make sure you are hungry when you go
3
the food sometimes tastes and looks pre-cooked long back : can it be made to look fresher and taste tangier ? sometimes I feel the food 25 years ago in the old layout was tasting better or is my tongue misleading me ? nevertheless, the fish head curry still is one of the best globally 
1
Now I try and keep my reviews as balanced and helpful as possible, this one is no exception only I cannot balance the review, you everything was bad.We opted for a table outside as the inside was very noisy.. Enough Saigon that one. The tale outside was adjacent to the waiter station but it appeared we were almost invisible- we just couldn't get any service... Eventually I order. We went for one appetizer to share, the house special mutton and vegetables, and yes you guessed it it all arrived at once( so now the not enough room on the table ) and the food starts to get cold. Which is more than I can say for the beer I ordered, which eventually arrived and was warm.The waiters then forgot to bring a glass of wine to the pony were I walked into the restaurant bar and picked it up myself.The food wasn't great, the it was served on a banana leaf, fine, but had side portions of various pickles - which looked like they'd been there for a week.All in all the service was terrible, the atmosphere was terrible, the food was cold and terrible and the drinks were warm and ( say it with me) ...Wouldn't go back
4
I think this place is a bit of landmark as far as Singapore is concerned. I've been coming here on and off for 15 years. Racecourse road. Had a skinful with a couple of my reprobate mates yesterday and ended up up here for some Indian - as you do.Tandoori Fishhead, black squid, crab, some lamb chops, kebabs, and the usual breads and veggies. I always like the food - whether I have a bit of pace on or not, and the atmosphere is good. You should give this a go if you are in town as a tourist.Its more expensive than it should be, that's my only gripe
5
Good food god prices feels autentic. Come here every time in Singapore. Combine it with mustafas, its à must.
5
Situated in Little India, you will have a great experience. I don't do spicy, so I had to stop eating and start drinking Mango lassies instead. But the food was great and good service too.
3
This Indian restajurant is not the best we have had in Singapore. We went to the one on Dempsey Hill. The food was ok, but did lack in flavor would not go there again.
5
Everything is delicious! I love going here , i used to go once a week or so.. It never lets me down. Everything is delicious!

Went and ordered Fish head curry, mutton sukha, black daal, pepper mushroom... the fish head curry was just out of this world!.... mutton sukha and pepper mushroom was great!... black daal (or daal makhni) was average....and the surprise was the 'vegetables' they give as accompaniments.... brinjal masala (blockbuster) and cabbage (average) ...Highly recommended for the spice loving, indian food 'searchers' .... Muthu's curry's rocks

My wife and I went here towards the end of the evening. We were told that the kitchen would be closing shortly, but they were still keen for our custom. While eating our poppadum’s’, we were asked to settle the bill, which was a bit odd. During our first course, they kept on bringing over our main dishes. We had to tell them three times to at least have the courtesy to wait till we had finished our first courses. It really did feel like a fast food place! To top of all off, they started to close the place down around us. I fully appreciate that they have homes to go to after work, but if they were pushed for time, they should have simply said that there wasn’t sufficient time to serve us fully. From start to finish, we could have only been in there for 30 minutes, despite having a bill of S$110.As for the food, in fairness, it was okay, although my wife found a piece of chicken in one of her vegetarian dishes, which could have been due to the rush in the kitchen as part of closing down for the night, but nonetheless, unacceptable

Little India is one of my most favourite places in Singapore. I love the energy, the smells and the food. I like Muthu's as the food is always nice and the service always friendly. What I like is there are many Indian visitors eating there which says something to me about the food
4
Headed to muthu's curry for lunch. My dads a big fan of this Place!Had their tandoori fish head. It was completely flavoursome. A must try!!Had their crab for main course. It was juicy and succulent! One of the best crabs i had.their service was fine as the place wasnt totally crowded in the afternoon.Overall, A good experience

We were in Little India craving banana leaf. Unfortunately we stepped into Muthus instead of going down the road to Apollo like we wanted to. They refused to serve us banana leaf in the "old style" where servers come by with pots of food and if you want some they ladle a single portion on your leaf. We had to Ryder dishes. The chicken Marsala was ok but chicken tikka disappointing. Naans were poor. For just those two dishes, basket of naan and drinks we paid $20 per person. Not worth it for a mediocre meal. Service was slow, we had to ask for everything twice

Hi,A few point to note about this restaurant:1) Nice taste of food and curry.2) Good service and well mannered staffs.3) Vegetarian dishes and drinks too expensive.4) Lamb potion too small, no value for money.5) Good ambience and interior decoration.6) Have free wifi.Overall a good dinning restaurant.Thank
1
curry fish head not fresh and scale properly, big/small squid taste terrible (do not know how to describe), mutton(goat) not tender at all, flower crabs worst not fresh at all... very expensive dine in
5
Loved the food - very busy restaurant - served on a banana leaf- fragrant and spicy - tandoor chefs very entertaining!
4
Excellent food & service.... Pretty authentic Indian food which I'm used to back home . The highlight most certainly was their Masala chai flan which was to die for.
4
It was awesome lunch at Muthus curry; non veg HALAL,awesome curry.fresh fish cutlet,non oily.
AMAZING DUM CHICKEN briyani.Dessert; mini gulab jamun with Kulfi ice cream...best in the world.NICE environment with attentive waiter-
4
My brother had recommended the place, so I went there on a business trip with two colleagues. I ordered masala prawns, and I became instantly addicted. Granted, the (huge and juicy) prawns themselves didn't taste through very much but the spicy sauce was incredibly delicious. We ordered some of the seasoned naan breads as well, which were fine, but noting spectacular. The food was so good I had to return by myself a few days later before I left the country - the second time I took Chicken 65 which was very good too.The restaurant was pretty busy in the evening and empty during the day, probably because I arrived after typical lunch hours. The place seemed to be really popular among locals too, even though it wasn't particularly cheap. Really good value for money in my opinion, though. Will have to come back the next time I'm in Singapore
4
After a busy day and an evening meeting with colleagues I popped in here on a recommendation. Overall it is pretty good, the food is well flavoured and appropriately spicy/hot with a decent menu with plenty of options; the set-up is ok, with an authentic feeling palm leaf to eat off, and a not unpleasant decor; though the only thing that seemed to let this down was the service. Whilst it was horribly bad... things did arrive efficiently, and no problems etc... it was just a bit 'cold' not quite 'unfriendly', but until the very last moment when I was about to leave not one of the staff smiled or showed any friendliness. Maybe this is just being picky, but it does detract from the ambience, more so because I was dining alone after work so picked up more on these things.I would recommend you go and try this place, it was one of the better curry places in this area - nothing amazing, but good enough for most needs
4
I came here with my family in the begining of January 2013. And this is my first visit to here, recommended by my friend. The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice, and the service is fast and good.The fish head curry, canay bread, and the shrimp is good.The service is fast and firendly.Maybe I want visit this restaurant again in my next visit to Singapore
4
It had been a while since I went to Muthu's. It had certainly gone upmarket with air conditioning. Though banana leaf was still used as a 'plate', the banana leaf was placed on a tray with spoon and fork. We ordered the peppered squid, buitter chicken and curry mutton. They were not at all good. The standout was the Fish Head curry. That was the only dish you need to order. The only complaint was that there was not a lot of vegetables (lady fingers, etc) in the fish head curry. The rice served was soggy. Tip: Ask for basmatic rice. They also do not serve paratha, only naan. Recommended for Fish Head Curry

We visited Muthu's Curry on 24 December 2012 and we were there for lunch. We were told we can not order anything from the Tandoor as Tandoor was not working, but I saw the Chef preparing Tandoori Chicken right in front of me. So I could not order any Kebabs as Tandoor was out of action. But they were able to supply me with Tandoori Roti go figure! My guess is either they had a catering order and they could't be bothered servicing the customers in the restaurant.I ordered chicken Chettinad and my wife ordered Palak Paneeer and we found our food served cold. Then we had to ask the waiter if we can order dessert. The restaurant was empty and the staff was too busy setting up tables rather than serve the customers inside the restaurant. A lady table across from us told the waiter off! as they took so long for their food.We had two mains, 4 Tandoori Roti's and two desserts,two OJ and we paid $S65. which I personally think it was too much for cold curries and bad service. I would not recommend this restaurant at all there are much better once around Racecourse Road in Little India. I've had some taxi drivers recommend this to me and we thought to go and try it but never again
3
OK for the taste of food but not very tasty to me. The staff was also not friendly though I saw them joking with some customers who are foreigners. The price is also quite expensive and for that price, I would rather go for some other Indian restaurants located in Little India
4
A nice complete menu, consistently good quality, decent service ... clean and safe .... slightly on the expensive side ...
4
While Muthu's serves a variety of dishes this is what they are known for. Easy walk from the Farrer Park MRT Station in Little India.
4
One of my favorite places for Indian food. While there are many other more affordable places in Little India, Muthu's is always a crowd pleaser. It's one of my usual picks for Indian food and my friends have always agreed that it's a great choice.
3
The fish head curry was just ok. After a lot of hype I was disappointed that Muthu's was just ok. Also the fact that it was a wasted chance at eating somewhere better in Singapore that hurt...
4
Friendly staff and almost no waiting a) to be seated and b) till the food arrives. Portions are right sized, not too big, not too small.
2
Visited the Suntec branch with friend for lunch. We got there early hence it was rather empty. Ordered two curry dishes with white rice. Pappadum was available while we wait for our meal. It's tasty but gets soft really fast. Took about 15 mins before dishes arrived (we had to get refill of the pappadum after frantically trying to get their attention). Rice arrived steaming hot but was disappointing because it was soggy and nothing like basmati rice that you'd expected from a good curry house. We had the chicken Marsala which was piping hot and pretty good but the lamb curry stirfry with cashew nuts was horrible! It was served luke warm and tasted fatty. It was dry and the meat was tough and tasted like days old curry. Overall, not a good experienced and will probably not visit if I can help it.
4
This is my fav spot to sample the famous Singapore Fish Head Curry! They serve free rice; popaddams & veg curry with all dishes. Also go for the Dry pepper mutton with draft tiger beer to wash it all down. However, mind the spice levels.... if you are unaccustomed to Indian spice levels, you will definitely break a swea
4
Go and enjoy your food served on a banana leaf as plate and use your hands if you like, as many people do in this restaurant. Food is good quality for the price you pay, and it is actually quite nice. The place is packed with locals enjoying their food much. The draft beer jugs are very refreshing. Food comes either immediately or takes quite a while. I suggest you order something that is already prepared first (there is an area where you can see what it is available right away) and then ordered other dishes immediately soyo can have your food cooing as you eat.The place is very close to little India main street and there is a big public parking right in front of the restaurant, at 50 cents per 30 minutes on weekends
5
It was a night to remember after a long day at work. Went to Muthu's at Race Course with my friends for dinner earlier. Ordered my favorite fish head curry, masala chicken, mutton chops etc...topped them with a naan basket...It was simply awesome dipping the naan bread into the hot and spicy gravy....the service was fast and friendly...after a sumptuous meal we continued with the wide array of desserts....Phew we finally left the place with our bellies glutton....Cheersss to Muthu's.......
2
I visited Muthu' restaurant on Race Course Rd for an evening meal. We ordered two curry dishes, vegetable kebabs, rice and nan bread. The food arrived very quickly - which was fine except that at best it was Luke warm. The mutton curry was clearly made by pouring some curry sauce on the meat - which was tough and chewy. The chicken curry was liquids and other than hot with chilli devoid of any interesting tastes. The vegetable kebabs were cold. Possibly have been standing for a while. They were also covered with a salty cumin powder that made them almost inedible.Compared to other Indian restaurants in Little India, this place is best avoided
4
Good place especially if you like spicy food and value for money as well... fish head curry will definitely surpirse you..... quite a big portion.. some of the dishes are very spicy like Chiken sooka but worth try..
4
Very good food and doesn't hold back on the heat. Service was just so so but the variety and price made up for that. A most enjoyable night.
3
Food is not freshly prepared but served from a kind of buffet. Didn't taste very well. Food served on re-sued banana leaves that feel greasy. Service was slow and uninterested. There are many better and cheaper Indian restaurants in town.
5
Its one of the few best indian curry fish head resturant. However, the price are on the high side.

Strolling through Little India there was little other choice than to go for a curry. Muthu comes highly recommended in some travel guides so we ended up doing a Muthu.The restaurant stands out for its appearance, i.e. within the setting of Little India it has an up rated feel to it in terms of class, with a cook and a naan oven in the middle. So in we went.The specialty is the fish head curry which we ordered. Added to that was a chicken chukka and a mutton mysore. The fish head curry was indeed very good. Good flavor, enough fish meat, a little quirky in appearance, so you are good on that one.The chicken chukka was ok, good flavor, not too dry.But then we get t the mutton mysore which was really below quality. Some very dark, hard, barely chew-able bits of meat with no moisture in them at all.And this is my beef with Muthu's ... although not provable.But walking through the restaurant there is this large display counter with pre-prepared dishes. I would assume they do lots of take aways also. At least the mutton mysore tasted like it came out of that counter. So not fresh prepared at all, standing in the reheater for a while and then served from there. Would not be acceptable for a curry house that needs to uphold it's name. Out of this world freshly baked naan coming from the oven and a helping of the very good rice helped a bit in restoring value but not an overall very good, I am afraid. Average due to the dried out mutton.A total of 85 S$ which is fair value
5
When writing a review for a restaurant and in particular a curry house it all come down to personal taste and what you are used to in your home country. On a recent business trip it's easy to go for the big glitzy, expensive restaurants. But we wanted a FISH HEAD Curry and I think we may have got the best. Fish Head curry doesn't sound good but it was, so go ahead a try!I love this quote from an earlier reviewer "It may be too large, too loud and the neon tube lighting annoying, the service not particularly friendly and the overall cleanliness slightly dubious, but the curry dishes we had were more than satisfying, both in quality and quantity and the prices lower than average" - I'd add but Muthu's was the only restaurant with 200 yds that was full on a weekday, all the others must be very jealou
5
If you don't mind an interestingly down-to-earth ambience, this is a joint you will enjoy. Condiments and food you order from selection at back of the restaurant is served at the table - great cabbage and vegetable side dishes, we had curried mutton and a fish pakora-like dish. Good flavours, spicy but not outrageous and splendid poppadoms. Cheap when the bill came - if I wasn't watching what I am eating, would have had seconds at the price :-)Don't pay for expensive downtown restaurants. Take a taxi to Little India and have a treat.As I said even if the seats are plastic and the tables formica, the food is 5 star......
4
It may be too large, too loud and the neon tube lighting annoying, the service not particularly friendly and the overall cleanliness slightly dubious, but the curry dishes we had were more than satisfying, both in quality and quantity and the prices lower than average. All in all, thumbs up
1
With all the fine restaurants to choose from, this should be well down the list. Despite their history and name, the fish head curry my wife and I had was very average. But the bread was terrible. The waiter encouraged us to have 4 or 5 pieces, but I am glad we only ordered one paratha and one roti. Both were dry and tasteless - like the server's attitude
4
This is a restaurant in little india well known for its 'Fish head curry'. The curry itself is a hot and spicy preparation that is usually eaten with bread or rice and would be considered a little too hot for those unaccustomed to traditional indian spices. The restaurant is well maintained and clean and the prices are indeed a little on the higher side. Many would consider a visit to Singapore to be incomplete without a try of the famed 'Fish head curry' and Muthu's curry is definitely the place to try this
5
Brilliant place to relax and have some drinks accompanied by great food together with family and friends. Super friendly staff. Price reasonable. Nice ambience with simple but elegant interior decoration. Definitely going again!
5
You can go wrong with Muthu's.
It;s not the cheapest around but offer qualisty food and ambiance.
4
I always visit muthu when i am back on vacation. It still has the pleasant environment. The briyani is nice and the fish head is really nice. Nice place for non veg eaters.
4
Excellent Sea food, real spicy indian stuff, only problem, you dont get cabs after leaving
5
Brought a visitor here for dinner. It was wonderful. Food and service. We also managed to have a bottle of wine which was kept chilled for us and poured for us regularly. The staff was wonderful.
4
great food, good quality and ambience. We enjoyed chicken tikka and naan.
1
We heard great stuff about this icon of food. Our experience was sitting next to a toilet with terrible rubbery chicken and the content of a Russian Salt Mine in the food. NEVER NEVER NEVER again.
3
It wasn't all that different from Samys ... but somehow eating at Muthus has always felt like a more refined experienced , but lacking that sense of "abundence". It's like comparing food served on a precisely cut 1/4 sheet of banana leaf, instead of a full half-sheet served elsewhere. The fish-head curries are more fiery though, and in that sense better than samys
5
I usually meet old friends at Muthu's for curry when I come to town. It's become a tradition. I always go to the original, Racecourse Rd. location. For the squeamish, don't let the notion of curry fish head turn you off. A big grouper head has lots of meat on the sides and along the top. There are other wonderful curries and tandoori dishes to choose from as well.I really enjoy my meals there
4
Had a very enjoyable meal at the Suntec City Mall location. Saturday evening and the restaurant was busy, nevertheless the service was good, the food was very good, spice level enjoyable and all dishes were well prepared and nicely presented. Our only regret is that we did not find this eatery before our last evening in town, would definitely eat there again
3
We had ok curry but GREAT tandoori parata here while on transit in Singapore.
3
Nothing special for vegetarians who accompany non-veg eating guests
4
Food and service very good, the smells of the food are tempting to everyone.
4
We enjoyed the Indian food @ Suntec!
We ordered:
1) Cheese & Garlic Naan
2) Masala Chicken.
3) Mutton Curry
4) Biryani rice
Total: $47++
Highly recommended for curry & Indian food lovers:)
3
Spent $18 for: 1 can coke light; 1 plain paratha; 1 main veg of mutter paneer. Ad this should be the cheapest of meals. So the 10-15$ range on tripadvisor is way way below. You can get veg food cheaper in little india. Seating at Muthu's was very food court like and in close proximity where you can reach over next table for the salt :). Somewhat elegant interiors. Food was okay. Limited on choices as menu does not provide for example the vast veg options one enjoys globally. They probably tried the fine dining idea by limiting menu. I wanted the navratam but spicier I was told they cannot do that. First time in my life I was told an indian dish could not be served spicy :(. Later as leaving I also learned that dishes are prebooked and available at the centre of restaurant so therefore you cannot get them differently. So, only some items are freshly made to order. Then they not aiming for fine dining !!!Service was good. I was approached 3 times if I wanted more naan. Not sure why becos my food was finished anyway. Still pleasant neat service. You must wipe you banana leave eating plate. Like plates are normally washed and wiped clean in fine dining restaurants. Here I had to dust my banana leave as it sits during the day collecting dirt and dust. Wet wipes are very nice. I'm glad I ate at Muthu's. Gives me a chance to continue my search for great affordable veg indian food in little india singapore

Brought a few business partners to dine at Muthu's Curry (Dempsey) and was very disappointed with the whole experience.The decor looks more like a canteen and the seating arrangement is very narrow for my Caucasian friends. The service was very poor and manned by many "trainee" (name tag) and they at every blur in serving and taking orders. The signature curry fish head dish was really a disappointment as it was served cold. The taste doesn't gives you a "oomph" and tasted very bland. Actually, the coffee shop near my place served better curry fish head. Most of the serving are very small, the mutton curry at $10 have only a few pieces of mutton and the squid at $7 have only a few rings. It is also served cold and takes a long time to come after we place a second serving due to insufficient to pass around. We ordered the briyani rice for 4 pax and it only comes in a small pot.I wouldn't recommend any of my friends to dine there. The overall experience was very disappointed
4
We love the Curry Fishhead here which is the house speciality. It seem to be very popular with the local crowds than the Indian tourist. Perhaps the taste is localized, but still it is good fiery South Indian Curry.Must try is Curry Fishhead and Crunchy Lady Finger.Yum !!
5
Muthu's is one of the smartest Indian restaurants on Racecourse Road (the boundary of Little India) - I found it in Time Out Singapore online. The family needed a pick me up after a flight from Europe and Muthu's delivered. Great curries, friendly and attentive staff. Very clean and safe for all. Not expensive
5
I visited the Dempsey Hill location. A nice area, away from the hubbub of Orchard and the CBD. A relaxing meal with nice flavor. I gave up my resistance to Fish Head Curry and am glad I did
3
Muthus has expanded and while this used to be my go-to place for fish head curry, I have now switched allegiance to Samy's. Over time, the quality has deteriorated somewhat. While it's still acceptable, it's not as great as it used to be
3
the prata was ok. Curry was better than most other places. worth a shot.
5
During my stay in Singapore for almost for 5 days it was the best hotel where i had indian food... It is located near Marina Bay sands... And in the shopping mall ther eis a laser how fountain which is good to see...
3
Pairing Indian Curry with Wine, anybody? If you have craving for curry with wine, then Muthu's curry is the place to be. Bear in mind that the same menu down the road (minus the wine) cost only a small fraction of the total bill in Muthu's curry.
4
Muthus curry has long established a name in Singapore. But its more known in the touristy circles than anywhere else. Food is reasonable. Restaurant is very very big and spacious. But i find the price a little more expensive than for comparable food in little india for the same level of quality
5
The food is very good and ther is also a wide range to choose from, the lassi is one of the best i have tasted so far, and the tandoori chicken in spicy, smokey and very tender and juicy. there are also a range of non spicy food for young kids. Mmmm, tasty
3
We went to this place as part of a conference group. They catered for our group of about 20 persons, which was commendable. The setting is like a canteen but you do get table service. The staff are friendly but it would be hard to pick it out of a crowd, and given it is in Little India, there are plenty of other similar options
1
1) Food are pre-cooked and do not come tasting hot and fresh, including the signature fish head curry.2) Taste is just average, you can find many many restaurants around that are far better3) More expensive than the average4) Questionable cleanliness, we found something not nice in our curry5) Service is pleasant but extremely slowI'm surprised at some excellent reviews here. Are we talking about the same restaurant?It's totally overrated and I felt embarrassed to have brought my overseas guests there
4
Went to the Little India location and was expecting something a bit more authentic decor wise, but it was comfortable.We went for the food on a locals recommendation and we enjoyed all aspects of our meal. From the typical Indian food we see in US to Fishhead curry and other less US seen options we truly enjoyed our food
3
We were regulars at many Muthu's outlets. It's not the greatest of places for vegetarians, but has decent choice. The food has turned from good to just average. On our last visit, we were certain that we were fed with some brinjal that had lots of chicken curry powder or something like that. I insisted with the chef that the food wasn't vegetarian and although we complained, the chef refused to accept and didn't bother withdrawing that from the table. Rice quality has gone down as well.
4
We visited Muthu's based on a reccomendation from a freind who lived in Singapore. It didnt dissapoint.The novelty of Muthu's is that you eat off of a Banana leaf. No plates.They are famous for their Fish Head Curry which we ordered - super tasty and just about the right amount of spicy kick. We had it with rice and vegetables (all you can eat) and naan (which was just ok) Desserts are excellent and there are some nice traditional Indian options.It's a short walk from the "Little India" train station.Defimitely reccomend
4
Great basic menu, fish head curry excellent.
Lamb Chops were superb. It took 15 minutes to get a beer but the food arrived quickly.
In Singapore this represents real value and quality.
4
This is a very chic restaurant in the heart of Singapore.Has very good quality food with a wide variety of South Indian Veg and Non-Veg dishes.The papadums are excellent and so is the Uttapam.Not much there to dislike. Did not try out too much variety as I was a guest for the Lunch.However, better to book in advance as the place is pretty crowded during the lunch hours
2
It took "FOREVER" to get anything to our table. They were busy but there is no excuse for service like this. We actually could see our drinks at the service station waiting and had to go up twice to finally get them delivered.A painful dining experience that I will not do again.There have to be much better options
4
Aside from some confusion with our waiter about whether or not rice comes with the meal (it doesn't, you have to order separately) we had a table filled with samosas, spring rolls, wedges, poppadoms, garlic naan and I had butter chicken (which was delicious and I could easily have had a second helping!!!). Hubby ordered navratan korma, the menu doesn't say anything about it being on the bone, so he was pretty disappointed. Price was also reasonable
4
had been ages since I dined along race course road & fancied a curry. Muthu's restaurant looked spruced up & has an open kitchen so you view your meal in the works . I went for the Chicken Tikka Masala to go with some Naan breads. The Naan was freshly made & fluffy , the poppadums were crisp, chicken was great, sides of cabbage & eggplant were good. This is a place I'll introduce to my overseas' friends for Indian cuisine
3
I've been in Sg for over 3 years now but hadn't been to any fish head curry restaurant, so when my mom made a request to try one, I selected Muthu's as I'd heard a lot about it. We went to the Race Course Road restaurant for lunch. The restaurant has outdoor as well as air-conditioned seating. The decor is plain and simple; bright during lunch. Like with every other Indian restaurant, we were served poppadoms but had to request for mint sauce as that wasn't served. We skipped the starters and ordered the main course, we ordered the a fish head curry (the smallest size was sufficient for 2-3 people), mutton biryani and Mysore mutton. The fish curry was tasty, but I found it slightly more sour than I would've preferred. The mutton was tasty and well cooked. The biryani was a big disappointment, the mutton piece was very big and hence tough, the taste wasn't nice either. For desserts we ate the Carrot Halwa which was average too. I found the pricing in line with most other restaurants along that road. The service was nice too. One of the stewards offered a voucher valid for 3 months (on similar lines with groupon etc) wherein I could purchase a $50 value meal voucher for $40, hardly 25% discount (they anyways 10% discount for Citibank cards. So I passed as I don't see myself going there anytime again in the next 3 months

Muthu’s Curry House – SingaporeThree ethnic groups predominate in the polyglot brew of nationalities and races that is Singapore – Chinese, Malay and Indian.Seems it might be a good location to sample some decent Indian food. And over the years we have had some great meals, mostly favouring the smaller places, food halls, and hawker stalls. Great prata, various roti types, Chicken briyani, korma curries and similar relatively common and well known dishes. Places such as the Tekka Centre where food is both good and very well priced.But if you wish to venture into some better Indian food in Singapore then Little India is obviously the location to head for.......and Muthu’s Curry House, serving Indian food for three generations is an excellent choice. It has been upgraded and has excellent air-con if a bit fainthearted. Do not be put off by the word “curry” – there is much more to Indian food than just a throat tingling hot curry.Definitely no beef around, but plenty of mutton and chicken is just as tasty.Muthu’s is on Racecourse road, not that far from Farrer Place MRT [ less than 100m] and easily reached by public transport, with regular services up Selegie road, one street away. Get off at the Broadway hotel.This is the original [and best?] location although other sites operate – Temasek Place [Suntec City] at Marina Bay. As a third generation restaurant [opened in 1969] they must be doing something right!And based on a recent meal, they do seem to have it well sorted.The night we were there was mid week, and the place was full. We went with local Singaporean friends in their car, and parking was a bit of an issue, but solvable. Nothing too unusual about that though.As a group of four, we could mix food around a lot and that is a much better idea than just two people. The Kashmiri Naan was exceptional as was the Romali Roti. The Kashmiri Naan has chopped cherries on the top – very different and a great taste. Most other dishes were equally good. Our main dish was the inevitable fish head curry, along with butter chicken, a small serve of chicken tikka and briyani rice – basmati rice with attitude – that itself was great. There were quite a range of smaller side dishes – across vegetables, fish/meat and rice/breads.Most dishes priced in the $6 - $12 bracket, with a few [often multi serve sizes] priced higher.Great food and is worth trying. Would we go again – DEFINITELY!They, like much of the wired place that is Singapore is online at:www.muthuscurry.com and wifi is available and orders taken on a PDA
2
Over Priced, the food is super spicy and oily. Being an Indian, I thought the food was nowhere near authentic. Infact, they can call it their own innovative cuisine as nothing tasted actually Indian. There are far better Indian restaurants In Singapore.Nothing much to say about the ambience or the location as well. Try it out still, if you just want to write a bad review :
1
Order of rice was supposed to be served with vegetables and papa dams but the restaurant only plain rice and still wanted to charge the full price. when I mentioned this to the manager, she didn't seem surprised. It seems to me that the restaurant is trying to con their diners. Food was also average

Muthu's Curry, Singapore vows the gastronomic world of ravenous sightseer for a tang of Indian flavour. The food off course is a riot of flavour. The ambiance of the hotel is not appealing – just another eatery joint. The service moderate – the waiters evolved in their own chit chat.If you are a wine drinker and think you can saunter in with your bottle of wine (since they do not have any decent wine) – you are in for a boorish jolt –The corkage is Singapore $ 10 per head and that was a real RIP OFF. The allure of consuming a BYO BEST WINE proved a nightmare. It rattled us with the wine corkage per head totalling to $ 60.00 for six of us. The waiter's are too keen to up sell though they know it's too much of food for all of us. After your dinner you have to wait hours to find a Taxi from this place as well! We will not bother to go there in a hurry
5
We had fantastic food and very good service. We would return!
( Very affordable. )
4
Had fish head curry and fish head tandori. (preferred the curry version but both were good). Easy to overorder. stick with the fish heads and rice and a vegetable and it will still be too much food.

Banana leaf goodies, i like

Pricey

Enjoyed the South Indian fare

We came here for the fish-head curry, which was impressive, but I really enjoyed the vegetable dishes we ordered along with it, although the hottest of them was apparently too much for some. I agree with other reviewers, though, that service was spotty. They brought one too few drinks for our rather large party without noticing, then when the lady left out asked for the lime soda she'd ordered they wanted to argue that she hadn't ordered anything before sighing and going to get one

I went here with my family when they were visiting from overseas. I had been there once before, the experience where ok – but wanted to give it a second chance. Got there and it took five minutes before anyone noticed us, even though the restaurant was not crowded. We ordered starters and mains (tried to order some Raijta, but the waiter didn’t know what this was...?), but got two of the mains before the starters. Let the waiters know, but they did not apologize, just wanted to take my mum’s dish away. The starters were ok, but the main dishes where all a disappointment (except the Butter Chicken). The crab dish was only empty shells, no crab meat. The Tikka Masala weren’t really a Tikka Masala. The Mango Lassi was too fluid and didn’t really taste any good. The nan breads were ok though, but didn’t help much as everything else was so bad. Living near Little India I have tried out different Indian restaurants, and I would not recommend anyone to go here. The food was not good enough and the service was really bad. For a lovely Butter Chicken – go to Kashmir just down the road, for excellent Vegetarian Indian food; go to Namaste in Seragoon Road. Both places also have great Mango Lassi and good service

The restaurant was recommended by the hotel and we also saw the reviews on the Internet. When we arrived we were eagerly greeted at the door, however they paid no attention to the fact that we said we had reserved a table. The waiter stood and looked around the room for a table, then proceeded to seat us in front of the tandoori oven, so after a minute of the heat hitting us we moved ourselves to a different table. The menu is limited. Chicken, mutton, fish, prawns and vegetables, no condiments but a selection of various breadsWe ordered a mixed platter for entree, which consisted of mini spring rolls, curry puffs, chicken wings and wedges- very disappointing. We then order three main dishes, however the rice was served 15minutes after the meat dishes and hence we were full and finished, at no time during our meals were we asked if we required more drinks or anything else for that matter, in fact it was difficult to get the attention of any staff. That was until we stood to leave and then someone came to the front counter.The mutton vindaloo was very good unfortunately it was the only thing, we won't be going back as there are far better places to tr

I went to this restaurant on 13th July 2009. There was a promotion like 10% discount for 'Citibank Visa' card holder. I asked before order if I could enjoy the 10% discount and showed him my card. The waiter said "yes".When the bill came, he said "NO" because my visa card is not issued in Singapore.Ha ha! That is fishy
