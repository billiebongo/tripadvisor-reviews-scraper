The Dignity kitchen is one of the most innovative restaurants I have ever been. It has such a nice ambiance. Food was also tasty. Especially loved the way, we were served. Such a warm presence. Please do visit.

When researching places to visit, especially where to eat while in Singapore, I wanted to seek out an alternative venue and visit a hawker centre, one of many located on the island. Yet I wanted to find somewhere that was unique and unusual and I found a gem of a place that not only feeds your hunger - it also feeds your soul.Located on the first floor of a parade of shops, in the Serangoon area of Singapore and adjacent to a wet market selling fresh produce and fish, Dignity Kitchen is a social enterprise hawker centre / food court that not only provides delicious food but provides training and employment opportunities to disabled and disadvantaged people in the local area. Set up in 2006 by Koh Seng Choon, a former steel works manager and management consultant who worked in the UK for 12 years, Dignity Kitchen recruits people with a wide range of social issues including those with hearing impairments, sight impairments, mental health conditions, survivors of domestic abuse and trains them according to Singapore’s Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) standards in food and beverage management and service.The food offerings range from home-made baked goods including various flavoured muffins, mooncakes, breads, Chinese buns and cakes to hawker stalls serving traditional Chinese noodle dishes, stir fries and Indian street food.Participants are paired up with each other in a buddying style system where, through working together in their specific hawker food offering, each learns about the other’s condition and about what it may be like for the other. Following the course, graduates are placed with employers in the hospitality and catering industry.But the support doesn’t stop there. As well as the training, they also provide a range of other services and programmes including:- corporate team building events such as their Hawker for a Day initiative where employees can learn how to cook and sell from one of the outlets - city tours and lunch visits for elderly residents- young children’s / young person’s pastry and baking skills eventsThey even provide a unique business opportunity for parents with children who have learning difficulties through Dignity Mama, collecting and selling second-hand books on dedicated stalls in hospitals.The achievements and approach that Koh Seng Choon has created have not only been recognised in Singapore, they have been recognised internationally, and Dignity Kitchen attracts visitors from different countries, whether that is a group of university students from India or delegates and officials from Chinese or Japanese governments so that they can replicate something similar. Their concept and training programmes have also been recognised by a committee set up to look at how the hawker trade in Singapore can be supported to ensure the traditional trade encourages younger people into the industry, raising standards in hawker training and the social benefits of bringing socially excluded and isolated groups together to eat and socialise. When we visited, a group of Indian students were hearing about how Dignity Kitchen provide training for blind cashiers; apparently, the visually impaired trainee is able to tell the difference of the coins and notes by the differing sizes, shapes and weights.So if you are looking for an alternative place to whet your appetite for Singaporean cuisine and hospitality, seek out Dignity Kitchen and get a taste of what is possible if, as according to the vision displayed at the entrance, you help in some small way “to build and return the dignity to the disadvantaged and disabled through vocation with passion.

In an honest review, the nasi Briyani wasn't worth the money. It was far from average standards. The curry tasted too watery. The rice were not fragrant. The serving was small. The chicken were mushy. However, all these do not matter because you eat here for a good cause. The person who prepared this had benefitted from this place having found employment there where he would have been casted away outside. There was a group of elderly music ministry members who played the piano. The place really gave the people a dignity. The ambiance was really great too. But food quality wise it needs to improve.

I strongly recommend and encourage families with children and friends to go to this place to have a good meal and also support this social enterprise. There are board games which you can play and also karaoke set up which no hawker centre can provide. The food court has a ISO certified hygiene standard though it is prepared by disabled and under privileged folks. Try the Roger Rojak, it is prepared by Uncle Tiong. It is good. There are white and black sauce rojak. We tried the white Rojak and it is good. The muffins are great ! Price is reasonable at $1.80 only. Highly recommended. Though it is not air-con, it is windy. I personally like Jason's fishball and curry noodles. The curry is not spicy and I have. A good serving of potatoes and chicken meat. Jason is a autism adult but he earn his salary with Dignity. Talk to Jason about Man U Soccer and his face lit up! Great good food, reasonable price. You help the Singaporean underprivileged and disabled with a good cause. Btw, the food is HALA certified and so is the place so that our Muslim Neighbours can enjoy the food too.

The ultimate hawker dining experience - Singapore’s first hawker training school for disabled and disadvantaged folks. The ingredients that go into making this really unique, require first hand experience. Importantly, it helps train those who society find hard to accept & those who work with them, then sustain what they learn, helps their confidence to feel included and then integrates them back into society. We had the privilege of being a small part of Dignity kitchen back in 2010 & 2011. Seeing how this unique project has moved ahead with much sweat & hard work from Prof Koh Seng Choon & his team is unbelievable. We dropped by for a family breakfast which was a rather satisfying experience.The dishes served up are as in a normal food court but the quality & level of hygiene is par excellence. It has the highest ISO 22000 certification for food safety management systems. It's one of a kind. A moment of greatness. You have to experience it to believe it

That's what Dignity Kitchen is about! Special people learning and running this multi-cuisine hawker food court !! Great variety, high on hygiene, relaxed casual ambience and good food preparations. Most importantly - eating here is my small drop in the mighty ocean, in making their lives better. I had the chance to get to know more by visiting 2-3 times across many years. Was so heartening to know stories of joy all the way, from the team.... for self sufficiency in doing tasks, respect for making a contribution, acceptance in integration with the society and a sense of purpose in their everyday living. Applause to the undeterred spirit of those behind the scene !! who have had the compassion to brave many hurdles in the journey to make the idea possible. For no personal gain or motive and infact at the cost of other more lucrative opportunities turned down. Only to make a better and caring society for all. Lets join them too and do our smallest bit . My whole-hearted request - please support Dignity Kitchen !

A meal at Dignity Kitchen makes you feel good in many ways. The food is typical of Singapore hawker food, but the way that it is prepared and served...that's where the difference lies. Most, if not all, of the vendors are either under-privileged or are parents of someone who is. So, even as you enjoy the delicious food at very affordable prices, you feel good that your patronage is helping someone who is seeking independence and a livelihood despite being physically or medically challenged.I understand that DK is like a training place for these less-privileged individuals to learn how to operate and run their own food service. Graduates of the program move on to run their own stalls in other food courts...making way for new trainees to take up the space in DK that they vacate.Kudos to the people who run Dignity Kitchen for coming up with this concept - a private effort at helping people who have been dealt a less than ideal set of cards! Eat good...feel good
