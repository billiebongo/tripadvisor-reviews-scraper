Food is good but service can be improved as waitress did not seem to quite understand the operations/English

Quite similar quality of rice to Hiroshima Ootoya. Fish not as fresh though. A simple fuss free family restaurant with decent variety. Prompt service but not exactly the most friendly.

For a long time I've been looking high and low for good udon in Singapore and I think I've found it! The udon was chewy and the broth was clear and light, all at a very reasonable price! Would definitely return.

I had the warm soba and Chirashizushi is really good. The serving size is of good size. I was told that they have free flow of rice and miso soup. Though the set is a little on high price.Wish the set lunch is a little more attractive. That day those offered did not appeal to me

You can have your meal in peace, away from prying eyes since this restaurant encloses its tables with a wooden wall of sorts. The shopping mall crowds can't see in, and it helps to block out the noise so you don't have to raise your voice much.The food is tasty and portions are generous, although the price might be a little steep (considering this is in a neighbourhood mall).

We ordered 4 set meals, 3 of which is their grilled fish set menus that come with chawanmushi and a Katsu don set meal.The fish was a bit plain tasting though, chawanmushi was a bit salty. Salmon sashmi was okay but not great. Overall we spent SGD$136 for a meal for four

My friend and I came here on a Friday evening without reservation but managed to get a table easily. Service was polite, if a little bit on the slow side. The staff appeared confused and disorganised. Waiting time for food to show up was reasonable though.We went with two set meals; I ordered the beef, which was cooked just to my liking, if a little on the salty side. The chawanmushi, pickles, miso and rice wrap up the meal, but I felt that there was too much rice and not enough of everything else. I fully agree with the reviewer Jeryl N that for what you pay, it's not a lot of food, especially the meat (and I'm a petite female speaking)

One of the best japanese grill in Singapore, especially the beef. However, the quantity of meat needs to be reconsidered, compared to the pricey tag, it might not be satisfying enough to have a few small slices of meat for $25.Service speed needs to be improved, staffs seems to be busy chit chatting than looking to customer's needs

Came here for lunch with colleagues. They have a relatively inexpensive lunch set at about $15/ person. The mains include a choice of fried chicken dish, stir-fried pork, oyako don (egg and chicken rice bowl) and hamburger. The sets include miso soup, cawanmushi, a refillable green tea, refillable rice and a small serving of pickles.Everything was delicious. My fried chicken dish was like a milder version of sweet and sour chicken. I really enjoyed the seaweed rice, which you can get without additional charge. I also think Ootoya serves the best green tea around.The food took about 20-25 minutes, which can be quite long if you popped in for a work lunch. They also forgot our cawanmushi (all 5 of ours) until we asked.That aside, Ootoya has lovely food, and for the price, very spacious dining space

Done in comfortable and earthly hues of brown and white, embracing rich Japanese interior designs, this clean-cut restaurant was a soothing, relaxing atmosphere for lovers of Japanese food lovers - gatherings for friends, family meals etc, all suitable.While awaiting main courses, we were served tiny dishes of starters - Kimchi (a traditional Korean fermented vegetables made with a variety of seasonings, tasting spicy and sour at the same time) and black beans with seaweed. Both were sumptuous starters, appetite whetting for sure.Next came my hot, sizzling pot of Mixed Grain Chicken Porridge cooked with Soy Milk - yes, it is nutritious and sumptuous at the same time. The thick, gooey porridge filled with a mixture of grains - filled the mouth with stickness deliciousness. The chicken was tender and brocooli soft; I finished every single grain of this dish.For more detailed information and photos, do pop by:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/lunch-at-ootoya-japanese-restaurant.htm
