We all selected from the range of salads, they also have their own bread. Plenty of easy eating food e.g. burgers (which are good)

Been to 3 outlets of Cedele brand and found them really committed to food quality in all outlets. Cakes are nonetheless to mention about the finest delivered. Gourmet food on the other hand exceeded my expectation on their quality, presentation, taste and flavors and what's more importantly, it gave me a comfort feel of what they served to guests with ingenuity on their menu creation and commitment to service. You can easily gets what you wanted for in their outlets; for my past 3 visits, all GREAT !

I've always liked the cedele chain- food is light and tasty and prices are reasonable. The toufu and mushroom pasta I had today was good, except maybe the pasta was a little undercooked. I also ordered fried chicken wings which were delicious but not so healthy. The thing I find annoying about cedele though is their service. They are usually under staffed and you are often ignored. And service can run the gamut from polite to uninterested and rude. You sometimes feel as if you've just walked into a service lottery

I ordered the white mushroom bacon pasta without rocket leaves, mushroom soup and blissful berries tea as a set. The portion sizes were good for one person but the price was high. The pasta was good, sauce was not very flavorful. The alfafa didn't really go well with the pasta, in my opinion. The mushroom soup had a mashed potato texture, yummy, but not really mushroom-y. Totally forgot about the tea until all of us had finished up and were ready to leave, alerted the waiter and he immediately made and brought over my tea. No apologies though. If I remember correctly, they also forgot my drink the previous time we ate at this branch

Much needed cup of hot cappuccino to pick me up, after a long drive to Johor Bahru and back. It's the wrong time of the day of one, but who cares. We had a 3 hour meeting with the 3 of us with another order of mint tea and sparkling water.This is not my first time at cedele. It's always my choice for good wholesome food

Cedele must rate as one of my Favourite cafes in Singapore.Food is consistently good and service staff helpful and friendly. Price is ok for the quality of food and service.I am a regular for breakfast and it has a good range menu catering for the health conscious as well as vegans.Visit the outlet at Great World City if you are shopping there. Worth the experience

Pros:- staff were helpful with vegetarian options - other 2 staff werre superb!Cons- slow to serve water- staff rather condescending when wanted to try the ice cream option as hadnt before. only looked mollified when order 2 doubles.- even with 30% bday discounts still not cheap. TCC is better value for the 50% discoun

We decided on this outlet at Great Wall Mall for a Sunday brunch for its relaxed atmosphere as we have a toddler in our company. We were shown to a table but had to grab a high chair ourselves.The Menus were on the table and we had to wait a long time for our orders to be taken. That done, we had to wait. Log time - like 30 minutes - before our orders reached our table. I don't know how long the food had been cooked but it was almost cold, so was the coffee and tea. However it was tasty and fresh and could had been tastier if it was warm. My poached eggs were cooked perfectly but the sour dough bread on which the eggs sat were soggy and tough. I did enjoy the accompanied mushroom. The drinks too were luke warm. The good thing about this joint is that you can take as much time as you want and they do not seem to mind young kids running Round

I've been back again and again because I've learnt to deal with / accept the service level. Go with zero expectations of being served promptly and with a smile. Visit only if you have plenty of time and patience. DO NOT wait at the please-wait-to-be-seated sign. Walk deeper in to the restaurant in order for wait staff to even notice you. Placing your orders would take at least 15 minutes. Getting your bill at the table, another 15 minutes. P/S: it's faster paying at the cashier. Now, why do I go back repeatedly? I like the healthy options at Cedele and food-wise, the kitchen has not failed me. Their pastas are wonderfully done, daily soups are fulfilling, mains and salads are tasty. It's a perfect place for vegans and gluten-free diets

Cedele has been a favorite of ours for their breads and cakes which we often take away when we are in GWC. We decided to have a sit down meal recently with our two kids, both of whom ordered children's menus. The food was so-so (except the breads and cakes which were quite good, as expected). However, the indifferent service really put us off. The waitress kept bringing the kids' menu items, such as hot chocolates, and would leave after dumping them on one end of the table - rather than placing them in front of the kids. And she kept doing this over and over, each time she brought something to the table. Really odd behavior from the service staff.

Wife likes cedele for its quality. I had the sea bass n shrimp salad, tasty n well seasoned. Curry was not available on this particular day.. Shame. Ice cream pretty darn good
1
The staff here act like they do you a favour by bringing you water or serving you food. No water was given after asking for it twice, bread had run out at the common table and staff avoided eye contact.
5
It stays open late. So it's perfect after a movie. Service is great. Food is always good here.
Breads are also very good.
The Go To Place for a quick and healthy bite.

The typical Cedele. Nice soups and sandwiches. Other items are only average. Great for lunch and tea.

A return visit this time with my husband to meet friends . A very easy place to relax and hold a conversation and an excellent menu. Staff aim to please so the time spent here was happy and fulfilling. The organic teas are refreshing. Try the lemon grass tea it's really soothing

The Cedele chain of cafes used to be one of my favourite hangouts. Although the service had not always been good, it was bearable as the food and cakes are good. However in the recent two years, service at the outlets are getting worst and inspite of taking time and effort to contact the management at Depot Road on several occasions detailing how bad the service was and also suggesting to them that it could be due to the fact that the outlets has manpower issues (when I speak to some staff member about the bad service, at times I can retorts that they had to rush through with the process as they are very short staffed) nothing had improved. To make matters worst, one of their outlets had customers suffer food poisoning which was reported in the newspapers. I had stopped patronising Cedele since last year because of the bad service and am glad as it looks like it is now also affecting their food quality. (Food poisoning?

 Food today is a total experience. It it's about kindness from the team, taste from kitchen, ambience from the set up. (Some of the cheapest fast food understood it and started to change too...)We arrived 3 Adults, 3 pre teen kids, 1 toddler. 1 stroller... Staff Elisha seated us at a small table and offered to transfer us to a larger one OR wait for next table to leave, WHICHEVER SOONER.We appreciated the kindness especially with 4 kids and many stuff...A minute later, CAROL the manager overrighted that kindness , told us we need to pick only one choice and wait. Or wait OUTSIDE the cafe.....The rest was not pleasant . CAROL gave me the whole thesis why she needs to do this...As a business author and business speaker, I simply said " why don't you support your staff's decision and a result of good leadership to empower, you train up great staff , and most importantly, your guests leave with a grateful heart to you?!" It was an unpleasant meal. We are not robots, please don't treat us like one

I'm a fan of Cedeles - I go to the one in Tanglin Mall or in Paragon usually. They have good bread, cakes, other baked dainties, salads and soups. And the coffee is decent too. This was my first time at the one in Great World. It's a nice space - with windows so that even though one is in a mall one doesn't feel en-coffined. And it's fairly large as cafes go. So I would certainly go back to this Cedele. I ordered something that wasn't so good though - sea bass that was fairly tasteless except for its fishiness. And the eggplant and rosti that came with it were nothing to write home about either. I was also disappointed to not get a bone-dry cappuccino, something that most cafes are able to produce. But I'll certainly give this Cedele another chance since my fellow-diner enjoyed a delicious and creamy mushroom soup with no added flour or cream. Good place to meet a friend for coffee and a bite if you are shopping in Great World City

I love the sandwiches here as they are always very generously filled and fresh! Also their coffee is quite good. It gets very busy at lunchtimes were sometimes you have to wait a long time to be seen to by the waiters but that aside it is generally a very good casual dining experience
5
They offer wholesome food in their menu. You can have your own selection of rustic breads that goes with the soup (one of my favourites). Overall, little pricey for the taste, but if you know that ingredients are sourced mindfully and only used healthier options, you can say that it's worth it. I keep coming back in this place. Recommended for all the conscious eaters out there.
3
The kids plates are excellent, but the rest are OK. I would suggest the black cookie. also, there is amazing bread that you can go yours to, with oil and balsamic vinegar.
4
When I think of fresh salads, I think of Cedele. Prices are reasonable, food is served on time no matter how busy they are. Their menu has many selections of light bites, mains, soups and desserts, not forgetting excellent cakes. Highly recommended.

Wanted to have after dinner cake and coffee here and what a mistake. Restaurant was only about half full. We waited 20 mins and yet no one attended to us. I went to the front/cashier to get some attention only to be ignored and finally the waiter said "we are short handed today, you have to wait" in a curt manner. I was very tempted to leave but was having a good conversation with my friendFinally a waiter arrived and we ordered. The cheesecake was tiny for $6Ambience was also poor as there was a family table with screaming children. Tables were also too close to each otherI'll try to avoid this place in future. Like foreve

As I was on the lookout for a nice salmon dinner I was happy to find d this restaurant. After viewing the menu for a while I decided to dine there. Their lemon salmon with potato patty and salad sounded delicious. However when I tried to get eyecontact with some staff to be seated I found it a bit difficult. Finally a waitress came and escorted me to a few tables. Politely I asked "Can I sit anywhere?" as she didn't point at any specific table. "Huh?" and a confused face is what I got for a reply. "Anywhere?" I repeated and pointed at the tables. "Yes yes yes" she said then with a faint smile, handed me the menu and almost ran away. I looked into the menu again, seeing if they had anything else I would fancy but I decided to go for the salmon. I closed my menu and tried to get eyecontact again with the waitress that had seated me as I thought she would be my waitress. However she ignored my eyes and looked away multiple times. She was standing in a frozen position with her eyes pending from me to one of her male colleagues. I found this behaviour strange until he came to me to take my order (after some awkward eyecontact between me and the waitress). Happy to finally being served I ordered my salmon and I asked about the drinks. From what I could see in the menu they only served coffee which I didn't want so I asked if they had any soft drinks or iced tea. He scrambled down my order and repeated it (for those interested I ended up with a lemon ice tea). It was difficult to keep eyecontact with him aswell as he kept seeing another table. It all felt a bit rude. I got my tea with a small pot of suger and I was waiting for my salmon I noticed that the light kept on flickering going from bright to suddenly dark which was unpleasant. The door to the street outside kept on opening and closing which made noise of course so the atmosphere was anything but calm and relaxing. I got my salmon quick and nicely cooked with a mountain of salad. It had mustard dressing (which wasn't on the menu) which I do not like so I ate as much of the salad that the mustard hadn't touched. The salmon was indeed delicious and so was the potato patty until I reached the final quarter when I could taste fresh coriander. I am one of those people who experience the soapy flavour instead of the tasty one. A bit embarrassed I tried my best to empty the patty of the coriander (it wasn't stated on the menu) so I could finish my meal. I went to pay as they don't come to the tables but the guest have to come to the cashier to pay. Even then I had problems with getting the attention of the staff. "Can I pay, please?" I said very politely, "Certainly madam" said the same male that had served me he repeated my order again and I accepted it. The total bill ended up on 34.25 dollars. Seeing this as an opportunity tu lose some coins I gave him notes and quickly said "I have 25" while I dug them up from my wallet. When I looked up again he wasn't looking at me at all but at one of his colleagues. I tried to hand over the 25 cents but he didn't look at me "Sorry, excuse me, here is the 25" he took them while he was counting my change and then I saw that he barely had anything to work with. He apologized, handed me a five note and one dollar in small change (including the 25 I had dug up). Ok fine I understand his situation, said thank you and left. He also tried to sell me a pre order Christmas turkey (which was HUGE) a deal which I declined. To summarise: food was good but in the end I didn't get full. Service was bad (no one came to check on me during my meal and I sure took my time), lack of eyecontact and communication skills from staff (the male seemed to be doing almost all the serving as the waitress which had escorted me to my table mostly stood glued to the bar). The price was too high for what I got and I won't go back unless their service skills has some major improvements.

Wow really great restaurant, they offered buffet when we go there. There was free cappucino or espresso because it was their anniversary , so lucky of us, and the wait staff were polite and respectful. The coffee was freeflowing, we took advantage of it while waiting for the shuttle bus to chinatown. Thanks Cedele, really enjoyed the coffee! The buffet was good but not many choices, well the price was also cheap

My mom and I visited Cedele for late lunch, there wasn't much customers in the cafe. We sat down and started to order our food. But as we sat we felt hot, so we requested to change to another table. (I was pregnant then, felt hot everywhere)We called the waitress a few times but nobody entertained so we change the table on our own. The service is poor and slow. Waitresses were not attentive and tried to ignore us most of the time.Luckily, the food was great. The free flow bread is delicious. The sandwich and the pasta too. At least value for the money we pay for. Just need to improve the service

It is a Cedele afterall so dont expect much!First, we were waiting by the "Please wait to be seated sign" for awhile. We gave up trying to get anyone's attention so we marched in, grab the menus and seated ourselves.Then, as we were flipping thru, there was this irritating buzzing sound. Ok, we thought it was the coffee machine or blender and will go away in a short while. After we ordered, the sound was still there! Thru out lunch, we had a hard time hearing each other's conversation.Only when I paid the bill did i ask what that sound was.. seems like the chillers need servicing!And maybe the staff need a quick morale boost too!If you want healthy stuff, i suggest the salad bar around the corner on the same level

Came for brunch - unfortunately there are no great brunch venues in GWC but they do have an all day breakfast. Not cheap for what we got and the food was OK. The waitress didn't seem to know the menu (didn't really know what soy milk was). Our food actually came quite quickly although we arrived before noon. I can imagine service could be quite erratic when very busy

I was usual costumer at cedele in great world city since i live at near this place. I love this place for the food which use healthy ingredients and the food is good also. But one thing that make me so upset and need a lot of improvement in their management. Their service is so poor compare the food which is good. The people here is not friendly at all and they dont even smile and one of the waiter that service me put the glass and serve in rude way. Overall my review was so bad for this restaurant because it is not happen one time only

My girl friend has always wanted to dine with me at this restaurant but we never got the chance to till now. Since I am here on a working trip and it is near my office building, this is a great chance!!There's quite a variety of food available and I realised that the restaurant promotes healthy eating.We ordered 2 mains to share (recommended by my friend) and I am very happy with the quality of food. The beef burger is super delicious (the beef patty is juicy and luscious) and the pasta is surprisingly very tasty YUMZ!! After our meal, we wanted to have desserts but after contemplating, we've decided not to eat any more becoz we were so stuffed!! The service is nothing fantastic nor is it bad; we were attended quickly & served within minutes after our orders were placed & the meals tasted yummy! What else can we say? Overall, a great experience and I will definitely come again

Always enjoyed going here - soups were good with own selection of breads to accompany. Reasonable prices for good quality food. Friendly setting.
5
This restaurant has a wonderful selection of gluten free food on its menu. It is also not too expensive. Lovely fresh vegetables too, either made into salads or accompanying a meal. Fresh fruit juices have a good selection.
Very helpful staff and good service.

The quality of the food here is first class. Healthy options are available. The bread and baked goods are excellent and the coffee is great

Cedele is my favorite place for lunch. Great and healthy food. I love the salads and the sandwiches. Pasta is the only dish below expectations.

This place has obviously pissed off a lot of people with horrendous service. Didn't realise this, have been here buying bread and cakes a couple of time, plus having tea as wellCame here today for a late lunch at 3pm and proceeded to order an iced mint tea and mushroom risotto. No service catastrophe yet. The ice tea has mint leave shavings on it, but they were pretty tasteless, and thus the tea has no mint taste at all. The risotto was a touch undercooked but edible. The rest of the meal and come payment, the service was uneventful, so i guess we survive

I was there last week with my wife and 3 kids and the server a young girl outright snubbed my wife and said that they were i quote, "busy" and "can you wait outside?!!" She observed the entire restaurant and noticed several empty tables... i was so annoyed and left the place. This will certainly be my last time at Cedele.
2
This could be a great breakfast place for a Sunday morning before the weekly groceries shop. Could be, but isn't. After waiting for 5 minutes to be attended to at the door, service was painfully slow. My pancakes were cold and my wife's not properly cooked in the middle. Oh well...

We were met by a waiter who obviously should have had a different job. A sign is telling us "Please wait to be seated", and so we did. We signaled "table for two" and the waiter made a fascist style and totally meaningless hand movement down to the floor, maintaining a stone face. The restaurant was far away from full, with lots of free tables, so no need to be stressed up or act like that. We finally got attention from a more normal waiter that gave us regular service but nothing more. We ordered a chicken walnut salad, a pumpkin soup, an omelet and green tea. First came the salad, then the omelet, and then after a long while, when we were finished with what we already got, arrived the soup and the tea. The service is absolutely ridiculously low level, however the food is holding a good standard and the free flow of bread is a good concept.
3
Kids portions are too small for anyone can walk. The red wine is chilled. The food however, while in small portions, isn't too bad. I just left feeling generally unsatisfied. Location is great - by the mall entrance. Good for an afternoon snack but I wouldn't recommend for dinner.
4
My favorite is the shrimp and avocado salad. It is very tasty! Pumpkin soup and mushroom soup score very high too. Even my 8 years old son, who doesn't normally eat pumpkin, loves the pumpkin soup. The bread bar is great too, especially when the pumpkin bread and/or walnut bread are available. Better still, the bread bar is free if you order a soup. What makes us come so often (at least once a week) is the foods are fresh, not many options but all are fresh, tasty and healthy. The only drawback is the service is not consistent. Ah, almost forgot - ice cream is a must try. Super yum
