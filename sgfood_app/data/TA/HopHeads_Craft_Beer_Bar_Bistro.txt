Good place for drinking but not for food. We have party there and quite disappointed for the food served. It somehow looks like from food catering. Environment is good for partying.

Their food and drinks are affordable, and I like that they have a variety of entertainment for us to choose from. It's a good place to chill with a group of friends!

Absolutely love the selection of beers they bring in and change every season! So many options to choose from. Service is great too - you can try before purchasing a glass and the people know their beers well. Love that thereâ€™s half and full pint options! They should have more finger food available

Venue is great for gatherings, food and drinks are reasonably priced and service crew are very approachable too! Overall a place with great ambience to just chill and not forgetting the wide selection of entertainment like beer pong, darts, pool, table tennis and card games etc. Would definitely be back to visit again

Worst food ever tasted in a Cafe establishment in Singapore. Was starving hence ordered Salted Egg pasta, chilli crab pasta, popcorn chicken & truffle fries. EVERY.SINGLE.DISH are tasteless and substandard. I have never tasted a pasta so mediocre before. The truffles fries did not have a hint of truffle taste and was oily and non-crispy. We gave another chance to order the popcorn chicken, but it was extremely disappointing as well. Where can you find a cafe with all food tasting awful?? Went there with 2 other girlfriends, hoping to have some good night but it turned awry. When I reached the place, there was no welcoming but the staffs stared at me as if I was a weirdo. No dedicated service as I had to go to them to get their attention multiple times. Regret visiting :

Had a really good time at hopheads with my friends playing beer pong, darts and card/board games that were available at the bar. Surprisingly, the food at the bar is really good. Esp the waffle burger and the salted egg yolk pasta. Great ambience and very good service from the staffs. they were all very good looking and friendly and helpful. Immediately tended to me and my friends when we accidentally topple the beer pong table and glasses were broken. overall a very nice place to chill and have a great time with friends

It was my first time here and I quite like the place. It is spacious, food are not bad in terms of taste, portion and value for money, and the fact that we can play games here - it's quite a plus point for me. It will be nice if we can have a few more places with HopHeads' concept - chill, reasonable priced food and a bit of play (not Xbox those kind). I would say that their food quality is good! The only comment I have probably is the ice coffee and ice cream drink which my friend ordered, the coffee taste was pretty diluted. It tasted like coffee added with lots of water. Not sure what went wrong but this won't deter us from not going back.

Worst food I've had in Singapore. Crab pasta was a joke because there was literally no crab, just a deep fried shell, overcooked spaghetti, and white sauce out of a jar for $17. The crab burger was no better, a deep fried crab shell on a $1 white bun with supermarket fries for nearly $20. Worse, we waited 45 minutes to get it. Avoid.

I was recommended by my friends to HopHeads when I was in Singapore for a short visit. I am impressed by the variety of craft beers and good food the place offers. I tried like 4 types of craft beers and can't wait to go back for more when I next return! We also had such great fun with the beer pong game. It's a good place to chill out with friends or family, or just by myself. A heavenly underground pub indeed! Thumbs up

When I first found this location online I wasn't expecting much. When I stepped in, I understood what they meant by "the only heaven underground"! This is a great place to hang out with your best mates. They have great games - table tennis, darts, an amazing array of boardgames. All these to choose from. Great value for mains and tapas, friendly staff, and definitely the chic decor is worth a mention. Love the ambience! They got themselves another regular customer. Highly recommended
