All the food looked good. Plenty of locals eating here so we joined in. We both enjoyed the Laksa. Service was good too!

~a very quick meal for the locals is a good bowl of Fishball Noodles (it's fish rolled into a savory ball), this one is absolutely average, nothing bad or outstanding good!
~Order & prepay at the cashier first.

Found this outlet in the basement of Singapura Plaza near the SMRT exit near the North East line entrance/exit.Ordered the fish ball noodle soup set with a cool lemon(?) drink for dinner....$8 all up.From ordering to being ready to eat was three or four minutes...fast food prepared by an efficient team...just right for a quick dinner - plenty of customers coming and going

I went to the outlet at sembawang sun plaza.i requested the laksa noodles to be cut which they did.thumbs up for service.noodles was overly cooked so too soft..cockles small and tasteless.the most important gravy lacks the omph flavour.maybe not spicy enough..but i must commend the big bouncy fishball and tasty fishcake..add a dollar get a cooling lime juice which was thirst quenching

The one I tried is at United square. Pork meat is soft but hard to be bitten to break apart I wonder why! Noodle, fish balls and taste are normal, it just that it's an aircon environment, more comfortable compare with kopitiam or food court.Coffee is good, fish cake is nice as what we can eat anywhere else

This was the third time we had eaten here in a month and we found the food to be consistently good. It's located at the basement level of Eastpoint Mall, opposite the Yamazaki bread store.I had the signature fishball noodles, which came with a prawn ball, three fishballs and a small fish wonton, while my wife had the regular fishball noodles, with a side order of fishcake. The fishballs were freshly made, springy and delicious. I found the fishcake slices to be a little bland though.The noodles were cooked nicely and were also chewy, and went very well with their chilli paste

For those who like a good bowl of local laksa and lives in the eastern side of Singapore should try out this local eatery which now has a satellite stall at Paris Ris Whitesands Shopping Mall.It has a rich flavour yet simple enough to satisfy any laksa craving. This stall also sells other local noodle eats such as minced meat noodles and fishball noodles.Worth trying
