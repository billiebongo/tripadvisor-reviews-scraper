Went to Safra and find this restaurant. Order the dim sum. Very attentive serviced and must try the salted egg crispy fish skin. Very nicely done and not too oily. Will be back for dinner to try out others.

We tried the set menu for 8@ $368++The smoke duck in wasabi mayo dressing was nice, the wasabi wasn't too strong playing the role of the bridesmaid.The soup was served inside a mini pumpkin, very unique and creative dish but the soup was too watery.The grouper was a big let down, too much bones and hardly could find any meat.The kampong chicken was a healthier alternative to a fried chicken.I loved the baby abalone with mushroom & tofu. The abalone and mushroom were soft and tender but the broccoli was a bit hard. The tofu was coated with a thin layer of seaweed.The prawn roll had high weightage of prawn meat.The fried rice was quite fragrance.The herbal jelly was on the bitter side but I was fine with it

We didn't think much of this place prior to the lunch appointment. Booked it cos' it was convenient since we were in Safra Punggol for another activity in the morning. And then. BOOM. The service was excellent, which is not common in Chinese Restaurants chains like this. Very tentative staff and they actually look like they are happy doing what they do. Then the food. It was great food. Good quality. Authentic. And delivered timely. The atmosphere was surprisingly pleasant as well. No crazy throwing of porcelain wares around and the usual cray cray loudness of Chinese restaurants. Can't ask for more really. JUST GO

We had dinner cum birthday celebration at the Pin Si Superior Restaurant which is located within SAFRA Punggol. Its good that we chose that restaurant as we had bowling and karoke prior to dinner and we did not have to drive out in search for a sumptous meal.Service provided by Manager Sky and his team was excellent! They were not only attentive but also very courteous and helpful. We had an enjoyable dinner and our tummy were filled to the brim! The food was tasty, especially the Peking duck, roasted pork knuckles and sambal prawn in ice cream cones. The serving was more than sufficient for all of us. When it was time to have our birthday cake, the staff did not hesitate to help us with the photo taking as well as get the cake cut up. We had a great time bonding at the place

A regular at Pin Si Safra Yishun, had patronized the new place at Safra Punggol & impressed with the nice touch in decor & food quality. Reasonable price for a decent lunch for a family of 3. Friendly staff who changed the dishes & top up drinks promptly. A new favorite place for our family gathering

The tables are well spaced apart and the ceiling is high. There is also a wide glass window panel where we can look out to the greens while enjoying our meals. The chairs are also well cushioned hence it is very pleasant to dine there. Most of their tim sum taste good and are moderately priced. One interesting item on the menu is their mushroom bun. It is shaped into a button mushroom and is lovely to look and tasty to eat. The trio combination plate tastes great except it is a bit pricey at $58++. We enjoyed 20% discount using SAFRA card and ended up spending approx S$22/person. Overall, we have a enjoyable lunch there
