I canâ€™t help but bought enough to feed 5 for 2 meals. Salted fish, bagadel, sambal goreng, tahu telur, egg plant, beef Redang, bbq chicken and beef tripes. All had a very satisfied lunch with enough left over for dinner.

If you are looking for a heavenly taste right here in the heartlands, this is it. The food is so good, words cannot describe, But expect very long queue from food lovers.

This corner stall usually has a long queue. And understandable, as they offer a very large range of dishes, and each dish is quite special. We tried many dishes, and most memorable were their Sayur Lodeh and the sotong hitam. We will systematically try the other dishes at another visit.

Is it just a hype? Both Malays and Chinese are queuing means it has a broad appeal. Some unique dishes includes squid in black ink sauce, tripes in coconut gravy, BBQ chicken, .... in the interest of time, I packed. Wrapped with banana leave, it'll offer another fragrant from eating it fresh there

This is one of our go to Nasi Padang stall when we are back home in SG.Despite the long snake like que, forming every time we get here making our average waiting time close to 30mins each time (Yes, it is on a weekend)The food - Really tasty but jus a tad bit salty for me ( I'm low salt tolerance but can't get enough of it)The gravy are rich & aromatic and the sambal that accompanies them... out of this worldThe price - They are some of the affordable ones around the Geylang Serai areaThe crowd - The long lines along the stall front says it allThe verdict - If this is your first visit to Singapore, your first try of Padang / Asia/ Malay cuisine, you first hawker center visit .. matter of fact ... if this is something you craved for.. we say go for it. Experience the sweat beads forming on your head and your lips getting numb ( if you have too much chilli that is ) and don't forget to wash it down with a ice cold tall plastic cup of MataKucing aka Longan drink from the stall opposite. You shall not be disappointed

We spent around 2 hours at the Geylang Serai market, of which 35 minutes was spent queuing at this eatery, so popular was it.The Malay food was delicious and I loved every bit of my rice selections, including squid, tempeh, eggplant with sambal and bergedel, or potato cake. The beef rendang was fragrant, soft and sweet. Even my wife, who is not a huge fan of spicy food, enjoyed the items here.They used to have a branch near Circular Road in the Boat/Clark Quay areas, but this is by far the better store. The cost of my meal? Just $7.80. I would have had to pay over $10 in the Haji Lane eateries

The Geylang Serai market (pasar) has a really local feel to it and is home to several interesting foods that are not seen often outside this Malay area.This nasi padang stall in the food court is very popular for eat-there or take-away. The food is quite spicy (and it is heavy) and tasty. There is a big variety of meats (rendang, chicken, lamb and innards) and also veges (beans, etc) served up with rice. It is more Indonesian-style than Malay-style food
