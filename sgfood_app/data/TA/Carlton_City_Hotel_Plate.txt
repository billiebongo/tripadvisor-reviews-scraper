It was a quiet Christmas Day dinner, livened up by an upbeat carolling performance. The waiters were taking perfect care of us.

The staffs are attentive. Good variety is not a alot, but most of the food are what I would like to eat. Waffle is gone at 13.30 pm before I can try. Food taste is pretty good overall.

In a month, I tried both the weekday buffet lunch (Citibank 1-for-1 promotion valid till end March); and the Friday evening Seafood and Grill buffet dinner ($49.00 nett, after 38% discount).I believe that probably due to the location of the hotel, which do not have large shopping centre nearby, patrons are mainly hotel guests or office people from around the area. I enjoyed a nice, quiet lunch with friends. Even with only a few tables occupied, the restaurant did not cut back on the buffet spread but avoid wastage by serving small portions of each selection.For dinner spread, we are spoiled for choices with highlight like lobsters on ice, pepper crabs and chilli crabs, slow-roasted beef, BBQ pork ribs, slow-baked salmon, fresh salmon, grilled prawns and many more. Dessert highlight is the durian pengat (for durian lovers).However, the fresh oysters are disappointing. They are very, very lean.It's good value for money and suitable for casual or business meetings

Came here twice not wanting to waste the Citibank 1-get-1 Lunch promo, and I enjoyed my visits.Good options of seafood, sushi, salad, main courses and fondue with good taste & quality. The dessert are okay though I should say the cakes are rather plain despite their bright colors. And I couldn't make a decent ice kachang somehow!Overall it's good enjoyable visit, the service is good, and with the Citibank deal, it is good value for money

My 2nd visit. Variety may not be much but at a price of $22++ per pax, I would say it was still value for money based on the food offered. Taste wise, it is good though there are hits and misses. Surprisingly quiet on a Sunday afternoon. Recommended for those who don't like crowded or noisy places. Will definitely return agai

This has one of the better buffet lines I've been to. Not in terms of quantity - the selection is not huge like some hotels. but the quality, which is excellent. there are stations for seafood - fresh yummy prawns n shellfish, cooked dishes - the chicken rice is super good. there are 2 types of soup available. the fruits were nicely cut and plated. the desserts of cakes, and chocolate fondue ended the meal well. the only thing i was disappointed in was the that the waffles were not as good as it appeared. the service is excellent - we had our plates cleared without having to ask the wait staff. the restaurant is nicely decorated, well spaced out between tables, it was not as noisy though it was half filled at lunch time. it faces the pool on the third level. overall a nice place to have a meal

Convenient location. Though it doesn’t serve a lot of food varieties but the quality is good. Attentive waiters / waitresses and Restaruant Manager. It’s a great place to catch up with friends or acquaintances over coffee and meal in this nice ambience. Will recommend Plate and also come back more.

Main course and dessert selection abit to small.
Could improve on more items like some noodles station
4
It's my second time to Plate. Seafood is fresh. It's worth the money we paid for. But they are down with staff. So service kinda slow.
5
For the value, the buffet spread was of good variety and standard. The waiters were polite and efficient in clearing our plates and refilling our glasses. This is my 3rd time dining at the plate and I will definitely visit again!

We had our birthday celebration at Carlton City hotel. The food was good, fresh and a lot of varieties. We ate from 12 to 230pm and the waitress served us with full passion. will go back again.
4
Food is great. Service personnel tried their best but I think they need at least one more body. Otherwise a good outing for the family on a weekday night.
3
We reached later than our appointment time (booked at 12noon) around 1pm, there were not much food left. You must try the cakes and laksa.
4
Food was good. Spread was acceptable. A tad weak on dessert. Seafood is the draw if you are into crabs, cold and cooked.
3
Tried the Thursday meat dinner. Arrived with high expectations but left somewhat let down. Appetiser selection quite small and definitely did not live up to the advertising!
3
Went for dinner. The recommended beef is good, the other dishes average. Main dish serving and topping up is fast. Seafood soup quite salty but onion soup ok. Salad and desert spread is ok, except didn't expect the unusual ice cream brand. Customer service and plate clearing average. Definitely areas for improvement would be desired

My friend and I are meat lovers and when we saw your “Meat on Thursdays” promotion. So I decided to find out more on your website as shown below. It is stated “meat unabashedly” and “meat-heavy appetisers” so we decided to give it a try as it would be all about meat. Sadly we went last night and it wasn’t to our expectation. I love my fillet mignon which was good and where on your spread shown me “meat unabashedly” and “meat-heavy appetisers”. The meat that I found on your spread were salmon (don’t even consider this as meat), Parman ham and duck roll. I am so disappointed as it didn't met their description of your Meat on Thursdays

Good value @ $35 nett. Lamb is slightly overcooked. Enjoyed the rest of the dishes, esp the cooked salmon, mee rebus, steamed chicken etc. Service is good as usual. Enjoyed my lunch.
3
Food was average, limited variety. Service was mediocre. Parking cost was atrocious. The cost of parking was $10 for my lunch.
4
The service is good as the waitresses are very attentive and never fail to remove our plates when we head for further rounds for the buffet.
Though the lobsters do get taken pretty fast, the chefs will replenish them upon request.
4
Reasonable spread with sushi, sashimi, Chinese, salad, Soup, fruits..Dessert are mainly cakes thus I did not try. service was good. I like that the Restaurant wasn't overly crowded.

Was there for a three-course meal with my wife, and it was a fantastic evening. Food was great, well done by the chef, good serviced staff and nice scenario for a quiet talk. Overall, ID be back again.

As guests in this fabulous hotel ,we were offered a special dinner deal for $35; this also included a free drink and as the menu was made up with dishes from the a la carte menu, we booked for our first night here. This would also be our last. Although the food was quite tasty and well presented, the quantities for each dish were very dissapointing. My partners's salmon en croute came with a pea puree but without any carbohydrate or vegetable; the chocolate cake for sweet was tiny, and without cream or ice cream offered; consequently we walked away hungry. I complained to the gentleman who may have been a manager and he explained that it was our fault for ordering the special dinner option as the quantities for this are less than for the full menu. I apologised when I realised it was my fault and hoped he understood why I was mistaken in assuming that a special dinner for hotel guests would be adequate to assuage our hunger. I begged his forgiveness for my mistake and went to the Hotel restaurant next door for a proper meal, and did this for the rest of our stay

We were here on a Sunday for it's Recovery Brunch Buffet (which is only available of Sunday from 11.30am to 3.00pm). The Plate is located on the 3rd storey and next to the Swimming Pool.It was 11.45am when we arrived and the brunch buffet had already started but there was only a male dinner there then. There was no one manning the reception until seconds later (which I will explain more later), a lady staff saw us and informed the Indian male manager who ushered us to a table. He was polite and efficient. Upon settling down, we were told to help ourselves with the food.First of all, I must say, the restaurant was huge and spacious, very bright and soothing. It gave me a great and cosy feeling and we really indulged in the lovely ambience. Western songs were played in the background and really created a relaxing spirit. On this aspect, we would give it a 4.5 star rating.As for the spread of the buffet, frankly speaking it was quite limited (comparing to other brunch or high tea buffet we have had on similar price), about 6-8. Variety/spread wise, probably 2.5-3 star but quality wise, 3-3.5 star.On the day of our visit, the following were offered (but I may have missed out 1-2) - Roast Beef (very good and nice), Roast Chicken (average), Grilled Salmon (very nice and fresh generally though some parts were extremely salty, probably the marination was not done thoroughly), Sambal Stingray (sambal was good), Stir-Fried Vegetables (average), Sausages (the normal ones one could find during the buffet breakfast), Prawns (fresh), Boiled Egg (didn't try), Satay (Chicken and Mutton, generally ok), Potato Soup (average) and white rice.On the side, was a sushi counter (with a few variety) and greens as salad bar (but surprisingly they don't have tomatoes, corns, carrots or cucumbers but only lettuce) and some sauces.On the other side, was some cut fruits (Watermelon, Papaya, Rock Melon) and 3 types of pastry cakes (mainly cheese cakes), one type of bun with some butter, an ice machine for making the local "ice kachang" with some toppings, 2 coffee machines, 1 self-drink cold water dispenser and some variety of tea bags. All in all!While some of the food were quite nice and yummy, the spread could be improved to have a few more dishes. Usually for buffet, especially here locally, there will be 2 types of soup (to cater to both local and western diners need), fried rice or noodles (or spaghetti) or porridge. In addition, the variety of sushi (include some cold or udon noodles and tempura) and bread/pastries can be more and may comprise of local nonya kuehs. Also, change some cakes to other flavours, as not everyone enjoy eating cheese cakes, perhaps with chocolate, vanilla or strawberry flavours to cater to wider diners' needs.Ice cream was not available too which was also a miss as we saw some children showing their disappointment when told there was no such item available.Service wise. Throughout our entire dinning, there were about 5-6 tables (totaling about 20 diners) occupied, seeming quite bare from such a big restaurant. There was only one server, who was the male Manager. He took on 3 jobs, receiving customers, clearing the used plates/tables and utensils and being the cashier himself. So clearing of the used plates were slow as it was a one-man show. But he was polite and from time to time would apologize for the slow clearing of used plates. It was only until 2pm, when another male staff stepped in from nowhere to assist him.Well, it was interesting that the restaurant could be operated by one person, though we did see some chefs coming out from the kitchen to check and replenish the food but on the restaurant service aspect, its an OMO (one-man-operation)! Value for money? It was S$22++ per pax and considering the spread, it just meet the passing mark. As mentioned, with this price, we could easily find some restaurants in hotels that offer a much wider range of food and dishes and in fact, some of them are just within walking distances from here.Overall, we enjoyed our dinning experience because of the lovely ambience but food and service wise, they can be improved further. I hope they will! With that, they deserve a 3-3.5 star rating but because not able to award a 0.5 star and they are still not ready for a solid 4-star (for dinning aspect), I would rate it 3-star

Decided to check out the place as there is currently a 1-for-1 Citibank promo for dinner buffet. There is a good selection of seafood (fresh oysters, lobsters, scallops, crabs, etc.) as well as meat and desserts. Inlcuded in the buffet are beverages e.g. tea, etc. as well. It has been a long time since we have had a decent buffet and at a reasonable price, and this is definitely one of them. The oysters were our favourite - fresh and meaty. However, there seemed to be a limited supply as we noticed that it was not replenished after a certain time. The place has a nice ambience, and the staff who attended to us were polite. We spend about S$80 for 2 persons which we felt was reasonable. Would definitely tell our friends about this place

I went there last month with my wife and kid, to take advantage of this one for one offer. It was a seafood buffet, so I thought the spread should be good.In a way, it is. There's lots of seafood to choose from - crayfish, mussels, oysters, salmon, prawns and the list goes on. There are cooked and raw seafood items. I enjoyed the stingray especially. It tastes good.But the variety stops there. There's limited vegetables, dessert options. Some food dishes seems to be topped up less frequently than others. You get the sense that the chefs are busy with some dishes only. The prata is hard, obviously from frozen pieces.Would I want to come back? I think I would rather go for buffets in other hotels probably
