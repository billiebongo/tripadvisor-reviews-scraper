Quiet soft jazzy music, excellent brunch set with eggs and toast and cappucino. Very european, better than restaurant chains, in an excellent location. You can discover the Lavender / Little Indian district and pause there for a coffee. Ideal to spend one hour reading.

Food was really great! Tuna pestoPasta and tina pizza were our fave. Thai milk tea was also good. We visited the cafe twice in our row. Yes, it was that good! Friendly and accomodating owner. Will surely bring our friends along in our next visit

One of the less flashy cafes in lavender/tyrwhitt area but you will be abdolutely surprised by the food . The cafe is run by the owner a one man show and everything is prepared by him , chef / cashier / waiter is all him . The waiting time is about 10-15 minutes for the food , which is pretty reasonable ....we had the tuna pizza with crepe Mille as dessert with chendol smoothie and iced latte . Everything tastes so good the crepe was moist and gone in 30 seconds haha . Our next table had pesto which looks and smells good so we ordered too , and man was it just superb ! I might drop by later to give it a try . In a nutshell : very simple small cafe but big on service and taste !!

We stayed at the hotel up the road from this cafe and walked past it everyday to get to the 7/11 next door. We decided to eat here after having some bad experiences with hawker food and wanted something more 'western'. The first time we ate here we ordered the Hawaiian Pizza, herb and chilli pasta with chicken and also two soursop drinks. The food was great given what the chef has to work with. We were so impressed we dined here again before we left and ordered a jumbo sandwich and tiramisu which was good. Hot chocolate was very tasty

Great little cafe with a large brunch/lunch food selection. Jackey, the owner, is very friendly and attentive. We had just a small sandwich which was very delicious and the flavored water is a nice little touch. Love the individual interior and calmness of the place.Will go there again...

This little cafe is owned by young fellow Jackey Wong. His aim is, to give just the best for his customers. The food is delicious and high quality for little money. It costs hardly more than the food in the nearby foodcourt, but is properly served and tastes much better. The coffee is excellent and there are different flavoury blends of it. The pizzas are crispy and the pancake-cake is the speciality of Jackey. He himself is very friendly, provides good service in a pleasant and clean enviroment. Good place for a date, a business lunch or a quiet break. No wifi
