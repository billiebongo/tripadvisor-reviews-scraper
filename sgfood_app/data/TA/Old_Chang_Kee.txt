I was surprised at how delicious (and cheap) their Nasi Lemak was. I had it with the dry curry and it was amazing. Will definitely come again.

This shop serves cooked food for takeaway. It's iconic item is the Old Chang Kee Curry puff. In particular the Sardines curry puff that is slightly spicy but very delicious. It's worth a try for $1.50 each . Over the years the price has risen. I remember a time when it was sold for a dollar each

Needed a quick snack and walked past this stall. They are known for their curry puffs. They have a range of offerings, all deep fried.Spotted this chicken wing, which looked good. The chicken was decent sized, larger than the ones that you get at your usual eateries. A wing costs $1.70. One is definitely not enough, so best to get at least 2

Usually had Old Chang Kee's puffs while in Singapore.Had the Chicken and Mushroom for this particular franchise located at Holland Village area.The puff is luke warm by the time I bought and eat it. Otherwise taste is alright. I prefer the Curry-O puffs more.Staffs service is alright. Initially a staff who is ready to serve me when I'm not ready has walked away by the time I wanted to order. I was serviced by another staff later

As we waited for someone we were supposed to wait we decided to have some coffee and maybe a snack. Came across Old Chang Kee in the basement which leads to the Holland Village MRT. The person behind the counter was quite sweet.It is a quick snack place and the items available are mostly deep fried ones. The Sotong Head OnStik sounded interesting so went ahead with that. It was quite crispy and crunchy but not much in terms of the Sotong. More of the outer batter.The Green Bean Feelin was good and had a very interesting new taste for us. We enjoyed that though it can get very dry.For drink we ordered one Iced Black Coffee which turned out to be just about fine. Can't crib much as we paid less than SGD5 but have heard that it is a big chain so am quite surprised at their quality. I love the coffee available at the Hawker Centres and it is just SGD1.Maybe another of their outlets would have better quality but this one was quite disappointing

Came here after lunch (to the outlet in Market Street) for a cup of tea. Not very busy at around 12.45 so we were able to get a table without difficulty. Also a selection of very unhealthy looking deep fried food which we didn't try. The tea was ok but nothing special.

Not just in Holland Avenue but all over the island is a company called Old Chang Kee. They've been around for years but more recently have grown into quite a successful venture. The greatest single creation is the curry puff. They sell a lot of other snacks but if you are visiting you have to try the curry puffs. For an Englishman it appears at first to be something like a small pasty. However, this is nothing your average Cornishman would recognise. Bite through the pastry and you are hit by a lovely blend of curried potato and egg with some meat thrown in for good measure. I am absolutely hooked. A couple of curry puffs will keep you going for hours and they are such a handy snack size too!Old Chang Kee are not the only company to have hit on this little delicacy - Polar, for example, do a 'dry' version - but this is a very consistent formula for snacking success
