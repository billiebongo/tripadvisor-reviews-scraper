One of the best French Toast (cheapest) in town, given the price is so affordable! The cream cheese red velvet is quite dry, but the portion is very big.

Simple meal but it’s so good. The BLT is refreshingly good, crispy bacon in layered with fresh tomatoes tans lettuce. Highly recommended and most affordable

Drinks and bakeries are good. Love the variety of sandwiches offered - simple and good price. The cranberry scones are always a delight to chew on!

We lived in Singapore between 2009 and 2013 and our children attended preschool around the corner from Freshly Baked. We had 2 days in Singapore in January 2018 and decided to visit Freshly Baked on our tour reminding the children (now 9 and 10) of where they had some formative years. The coffee is just as good as I remember it and the food is still fantastic. The service is superb and stopping in made me homesick for Singapore. It is a really welcoming place and I was tempted to buy some cinnamon bread to bring back to Australia
4
The first time I visited was when I was brought here by a friend for lunch. I have since visited this eatery a few more times.I had tried the BLT and several sandwiches, as well as the brunch set. In general, the choice of bread is nice but I did find the bacon a bit dry/hard. Nonetheless I enjoyed my meals whenever I ate here. Prices are not cheap, but at least the bread is indeed freshly baked and delicious

Locally owned by a popular young Singaporean baker, this European style space of mostly French treats needs her attention in front of the house vs the kitchen alone. Unlike the service excellence of Singapore's pride, her staff are bored and indifferent to customers. The croissants are good, but not that tasty for the place to rest on its bread alone. Give this one a pass and keep walking--Singapore offers lots of bakeries and better coffee

This cafe was recommended and it did not disappoint! Rosemary was vdry friendly and chatty and obviously loved her job. Small cafe near the Somerset mrt. Great value and the best eggs benedict I have had in a long time. The make their own bread as well. Highly recommend this ge

I came across this place some 7yrs ago when I was working in spore. Fellow expat was literally gushing about her weekly fix of the BLT avocado on walnut raisin (a special - do ask) and I have never looked back since. Over many visits I've only eaten 2 things here (if you can't already guess the first...and their simple chocolate cake) so my review might be bias but I just want to say the mark of a good place is to do a few simple things but do it really well. The BLT has been my go-to comfort sarnie, to sooth the hangovers. The bread is always fresh, thick cut with sturdy brown crusts to hold the soft insides, crispy bacon and fresh greens. It's not in massive overflowing proportions but just the right amount of carbs and grease for a tender tummy. I've brought some male patrons who devoured it in 6 bites, max. The chocolate cake is much like the establishment itself - unassuming but with substance. Just by the look of the texture, you can tell it's moist and full of Belgian cocoa flavour - which was still good at day 3 (I tried to savour it over many days). The cake reminds me very much of my childhood, when my grandmother would buy these simple cakes from the market for us kids.I've since left the country but I make sure to get my sarnie fix every trip and it tastes the same every time. In a place like spore where F&B establishments change so quickly, I'm happy to see Le Bijoux is still around and the standards haven't changed. No trends or cupcakes with unicorn frosting, no wifi and fancy chairs, just consistent comfort food done well. I hope it stays this way

Located near Somerset Mrt, 5min walk away. Ordered an Eggs Benedict with Ham and a Salami Breakfast set.Both are served with freshly baked English Muffin and Wholemeal bread served with perfectly cooked Poached Eggs (for the Eggs Benedict) and fluffy Scrambled Eggs for the Salami set.The Salami goes so well with the eggs and the muffin covered with Elemental Cheese. The freshly baked bread was so soft and tasty You could even eat it on its own.Would definitely return for the breakfast/brunch sets.
4
It is a small establishment/ cafe with friendly staff. The various types of breads they have are healthy and yummy. Most important thing of all, they are freshly baked and the sandwiches you order whether to take away or to be eaten there are all so so freshly made as compared to certain places where their sandwiches were maybe made in the morning and by lunch time they do not taste so fresh and good anymore.Moreover, there is neither service charge Nor govt tax on TOP of your bill.Believe me, give it a try and you will love i
4
If you feel like some great scrambled eggs or a healthy sandwich with avocado (on some delicious multi-grain bread), this is your place!
3
it was very close to our hotel in killiney road ( orchard grand court )
, it has good taste bread ans cakes , worths testing , but i'm not sure about working hours , sometimes we were late and it was closed.
5
a good community bakery with a decent selection of breads, cakes and pastries. the brunch sets are nice and the servers are always helpful and polite. and oh, their ciabatta is the bomb!
5
This was one of two choices for breakfast that we were offered through Lloyd's Inn, where we stayed. The sandwich breads are fresh and tasty, eggs cooked to perfection and variety of loaf cakes enticing (pandan, banana chocolate chip, mocha...)
4
very correct breakfeast, seats are not the most comfortable but great little cafe with good value of money near orchard
5
The atmosphere is basic, but the service is great. When the waitress noticed I had some tablets on the table she gave me a glass of water before I could ask. We had the breakfast of scrambles eggs and bacon with delicious coffee and a small sweet bread after. The bread is delicious and I wished I could afford the calories in some of the cakes. We returned for lunch and was pleased we did so
5
We practically had breakfast here every day in Singapore as they had a deal with our hotel and it did not dissapoint. The bread, cakes and biscuits are all freshly baked on site and they were cooling them on racks at the back of the restuarant area. The smell was heaven and everything was so tempting.We had both sandwiches, brunch, toast and croissants accross the days and none of it dissapointed. The bread really is very good due to it being so fresh.The lady who tends to be front of house is also extremely hard working, taking orders and running around yet always friendly. It is located just 5 minutes off Orchard road so would be a good place to stop for a shopping break away from the main drag
5
Freshly Bakes is a small cafÃ© which sells freshly baked bread of various concoctions daily, Whole meal, rye, olive and you name it for breads they have it. Focaccia, etc etc. Superb gourmet sandwiches which is healthy and good to fill one for a meal. Comes with some salad too. The cakes, the pandan, Belgian chocolate, fruit cake are superb. Not forgetting the butter cake. Staff are friendly. A lady by the name of Rose is always in front manning the counter. She is young, efficient and has the capability of multi tasking. She is pleasant and speaks well
5
These guys rock. By that, I mean the baking is fantastic. While it doesn't look 'all that' from the outside, appearances are deceptive. As someone who has lived here for over 3 years, this is my absolute go-to place for great bread, sandwiches (and even the occasional cake/cookie!). Absolutely try the house bacon sandwich, and without doubt also try the cheesy bread (especially good when toasted, if you haven't already wolfed it down).I can't recommend this place enough :
5
I found this place while walking to the Botanical Gardens. They had a big menu out front and I saw BLT. I hadnt had bacon in weeks so I figured I'd give it a shot. It was a good sized sandwich on soft brrad which I think they bake themselves. It also had avocado on it which I had never seen before but was actually really good. The most important part was that they didnt skimp on the bacon and it was very filling. Overall this was a great little place with a delicious and inexpensive lunch. Just what I needed foe energy before walking around the gardens
3
Had breakfast/brunch here which was nice, but nothing outstanding. The brunches were a bit small considering the price.
5
Despite I was stayed five nights, I have breakfast twice there where the freshly baked bread and the coffee is also nice.
5
Went to this place for sandwiches and it is one of few places I have gotten real bacon in Singapore. The sandwiches were delicious.
5
Here to have breakfast, oh sooooo nice! The coffee was delicious. The fragrant freshly baked bread was -i believe- what made me want to go back there again for the next breakfast. I had sandwich and pandan cake. Lovely!

Authentic bakeries are not easy to find in Singapore, but, Freshly Baked by Le Bijoux at 57 Killiney Road is an exceptional and authentic bakery!If you are in the vicinity of Somerset MRT or Sing Tel at Somerset, definitely walk to this charming bakery for a coffee and preview of these exceptional breakfast and flavored breads, as well as, authentic croissants and pastries. Service with a smile, which is infrequent in Singapore, is always here to greet you!Treat yourself to a coffee break and smell the delightful aromas which fill this charming bakery and cafe
5
Staying at Lloyds Inn, we were pointed in this direction for coffee and breakfast. Its basic seating ( not great if you have a bad back ) but the food is tasty and fresh. It smells amazing in there. Cakes are nice but pricey by UK standards. The bread is to die for and for a little shop as pretty tasty coffee too. Worth a visit especially if your staying next to it like us
5
As someone who has lived in Singapore for several years, I can easily say this is one of the best bakeries here. The bread is always fresh, the pricing reasonable, and there is service with a smile. I can also highly recommend the bacon sandwich! Very recommended
5
My boyfriend had a pulled pork sandwich and I had a French Toast. Just WOW! It's the best French toast I've ever had. The pulled pork sandwich was also really good. Definently worth a visit since its not far from orchard gateway or somerset station. Go there!!
5
As soon as you enter this place at the corner of Killiney - you are smacked with the aroma of fresh baking! With a wide variety of sweet and savoury bakes, and brilliant sandwiches, brunch, lunch and dinner options this place is one of the most popular eateries on the street. Get off Orchard and head to Killiney for food fiesta!! I ordered the marble cake which was soft and just perfect. I also ordered the Cinnamon French Toast. It is made with the bakery's cinnamon bread. It is so light that it melts in your mouth. A must have!!! To top it the proprietress is super sweet herself - and explains how each dish is made when asked... Go here if you have a sweet tooth or want a good English breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and more!!

I was a little sad that their other shop, The Dough Shoppe at Kampong Bahru, has closed, and therefore decided to come here to give it a try. The same lady who manned the counter at TDS now mans the counter here. I had a beef brisket sandwich, which was good, but the food here is a little more expensive here than it is at TDS. I find the servings here smaller, and there's no side of salad/ chips. Still, at $9.90, it's not too bad. Their cakes and brownies don't look too bad, may come back to try them another time
5
chocolate cake, mocha cake are moist moist moist and the chocolate taste/coffee taste are rich! do try cheese loft bread!
4
The other location with discount for breakfast if you stay at Lloyd's Inn. Crowded, with locals at breakfast. Eggs and toast - the toast was a thick whole-grain and wonderful.
5
Weekend treat is their baguette and coffee. On the bustling corner of Killiney and Exeter Road. A few sidewalk tables and indoor seating, or just take a few baguette and croissants with you. Great spot
5
Freshly baked is a small cafe in Killiney Road. Excellent sandwiches , brownies, and breads.
Quiet place to take a break.
3
I got the deli corned beef w/ fried egg sandwich (I did ask for an extra egg). The sandwich was quite good but the cafe itself left much to be desired in desired. It felt a little dingy although it seems to have received a grade A rating for cleanliness and hygiene. Staff were definitely not friendly but overall a good place to grab a quick bite for lunch
5
Enjoyed delicious western breakfasts/brunches with an amazing choice of breads, all freshly baked, you even see them cooling on the racks straight out of the oven. Yummy fillings for sandwiches & cakes to "die" for. Excellent coffee & fun sitting on the pavement watching the world go by
5
I know, I know, I'm in Singapore and I should really have kaya toast or something, but after 3 days of Asian breakfasts, I felt like something more like back home. Freshly Baked was an excellent choice, delivered a great bacon & eggs breakfast. Nice to have option available in Singapore, without having to pay $30-40 at one of the big hotels
4
I had breakfast here twice as my hotel provided vouchers for it. It has great food and a nice atmosphere. They serve good coffee and have amazing sandwiches. As it isn't far from Orchard Road, it is worthwhile to have a break from your shopping adventures and check it out
4
Was in the area and decided to pop by to grab a sandwich for breakfast. I ordered a BLT to go. The bacon was still crispy despite being in the plastic box for an hour. The bread was not soggy and the avocado was soft and creamy. Would love to visit again to try the other sandwiches.
4
This was a surprise find and very close to the Holiday Inn. The owner (i think) served us well on the first day, that we went back again on the second day for breakfast. The food served was nice and portions just right for the whole family. Even bought back some of the freshly baked breads for friends and famil
5
Lived just down the street and this place was great! LOVED the cakes, and Cinnamon Bread!!!! The sandwiches are good as well. Nice place for brunch!
4
Our takeaway sweet fix. We buy from here slices of cakes to have back in our hotel room. Around $3 a slice. Come boxed, so easy to keep in the fridge. Helpful patient staff.
3
Decided to use hotel voucher at FB. Bacon and scrambled eggs, toast and coffee. What more can you say? Better off eating that sort of meal in a western restaurant rather than Singapore where you can be sampling local dishes.
4
The best chocolate sponge cake... was moist.. not too sweet n the price was reasonable. ..U got to try to believe the taste is real yummylicious
4
We got vouchers by the lloyds inn for the kopitiam , for a little extra we had a good capuchino and croissant at freshly baked. We were lucky and could sit outside and observe the street life.
4
We also had vouchers from Lloyd's Inn for three types of brunch and coffee/tea at $7. A great option and simple for carnivores, vegetarians and sweet tooths alike. I will be going back for their delicious looking cheese rolls.
5
Our Hotel (Lloyds Inn) give vouchers for breakfast here. It was lovely fresh food and well worth the cost.
2
Stopped by for a cappuccino. Would have tried the food but the coffee was so dire we skipped. Problem - coffee was the super heated meaning the milk formed a surface rather than a foam. How - probably the same jug of milk repeatedly overheated rather than heated fresh. All at 4sgd per cup and delivered with a scowl and a grubt rather than a smile.
4
We stayed close by to Le Bijoux and popped in almost everyday to enjoy the variety of cakes. Priced very reasonably at around $3 (some less), we often had a coffee as well. Wholesome fresh baked breads are also fantastic and it is convenient to eat in or take away. Overall we loved this little bakery and could only be improved by a real barista made coffee
3
This is definitely a favourite of expats living/working in the area. An unassuming cafe, with lovely cheerful staff manning the front cashier area, welcoming each customer. They sell sandwiches for dining-in or takeaway, and various pastries and cakes. All bread and pastries are baked fresh everyday. Among their sandwiches, I really enjoy their pulled-pork roll, while their BLT doesn't take a step wrong. For pastries, I've only had their croissants & pain chocolate (both very nice). Among all these things, their chocolate cake is the star (in my opinion). It's nicely moist, very chocolatey, super more-ish, and generally leaves you feeling good and sinful... which is what a good chocolate cake should do! ;)Recommended for their chocolate cake
5
Always fresh sandwiches and tasty. The best place for your breakfast and branches. Also has Outdoor seats. Recommend.
5
I ordered Classic set B while my husband took set C, it was to our liking. Iced coffee was not fantastic though, it tasted diluted.
5
Nothing bad to say AT ALL!!!!! I bought some cookies back home & they are still fresh!!!!! Service is excellent!!!
4
I was almost fooled by the unassuming exterior of this cafe/ bakery when i found myself on Kiliney road at lunch time while running an errand. 'Freshly baked' have so much to offer- more than just your typical brunch menu, but also quality cakes and gourmet bread that are very affordable. My favorites include the soft cheese bread and Belgium chocolate pound cake. I like to pair my bread with the milk tea from Kiliney cafe from just a few doors down, they go so well together. Highly recommended place, try it and thank me later! :
5
My family n I had brunch at this corner cafe/bakery this morning! What a wonderful treat we had! The cafe had a very friendly and casual atmosphere. The staff was efficient and Rosy was so welcoming! The breads were freshly baked and in sufficient variety to make me want to try them all! I settled for the walnut bread and it was simply delicious when spread with the rich & thick. homemade jam! Yum!We tried a variety of sandwiches and loved them all! The pulled pork sandwich was the right amount of tasty and tender meat. The tuna sandwich was delicious and not too heavy. The smoked salmon was fresh and my son finished it in minutes. For dessert, we shared the cinnamon French toast and our meal couldn't have ended on a sweeter note! The toast was soft with a hint of crisp and the right amt of cinnamon sugar!The bakery has a range of cakes too. I took the banana cake home. It was nice with loads of bananas and not too sweet which is great!Great food at reasonable prices in a casual friendly setting
3
Quite nice cappuccino, even though it comes out of a push-button machine. We consider ourselves lucky if we find a barista-style coffee in Asia! The breads, pastries and cakes baked on the premises are delicious, and we really enjoyed the 'gourmet sandwiches' with door-stop sized slices of lovely wholemeal seed bread
5
This little gem is good value for money - the sandwiches are reasonable well filled and they also do breakfast sets until around 11am. The cakes look divine and the biscuits are very yummy! When I was there for lunch there were several freshly baked cakes cooling on a table down the back, so clearly all fresh baked on the premises :
3
I had the salmon sandwish,which was average. The bread was nice though,and the coffee. The service was ok. I did receive my order on time, but the waiter was bringing our food one by one. Its a good restaurant if you want to switch for a while to western food. I think it was a little bit expensive for what you get
4
This tiny bakery always do a great veggie sandwich with fresh baked brown bread.Its all packaged and ready to take back to the office and only costs about $7.50.They also have a variety of cakes and pastries to choose from. You can sit down and eat but its a bit hot in the singaporean weather, even though the cafe is air conditioned
5
On the last day of our vacation we went to Freshly Baked to have brunch. Knowing that our son had just gotten scalded in our hotel, the staff went the extra mile to help him by giving him some ointment and cold water to compress his finger. The owner even gave my son a really good chocolate chip cookie to stop him from crying. Really, really nice and friendly! The brunch set was also very good and fulfilling. Will definitely go back there the next time we go to Singapore. Thank you very much
