Don't get the hype about this restaurant. I wouldn't say that this is an amazing restaurant with outstanding food. Food was ok, nothing spectacular. Maybe we ate at the wrong Putien....who knows. Service was just ok.
5
We had an extraordinary meal at this restaurant - we loved all the different dishes which were put on our table. The service was friendly but very efficient.
I do, however, find it a bit strange that the restaurant has got one Michelin star.
5
Tried a few Putiens in Singapore but this one is well and truly a class above. Not sure if the food options are the same but this one doesn’t feel mass produced and the flavours are wholesome yet delicate too
4
We came here to celebrate our daugthers’ birthday dinner. We ordered the set menu which had the steamed yellow fish, fried chicken, steamed prawns in bamboo, Luo Mee (in starch stock), duck with yam roll. Great service and there is corkage for wine ($18/bottle)
1
As the place was packed, somehow it feels like the food was mass produced. The dishes lacked the quality we expected of a Michelin 1-star restaurant that we previously experienced. Nothing outstanding, presentation was lacking and the food was lukewarm or cold. There were even missing key ingredients in some of the dishes. Example, for conpoy with mushroom and broccoli, the conpoy was not there. The service was also very poor. Our teapot did not get replenished with hot water for a long time and we have to replace our own individual used plates with clean ones. On the whole, not worth the money spent and the experience for an important family dinner there

I visited Putien’s Ion branch with my family over the Lunar New Year and the experience left much to be desired. While the wait staff were pleasant, patient, and tried their best to be helpful, they simply were unable to cope with the crowd that evening. In fact, we had to wait 30 minutes for our table, despite the fact that we’d already made a reservation - and that the table we were assigned to was already empty. After we were seated, we had to wait a good 20 minutes before the first dish (yusheng, for goodness’ sake!) was served. The thick soup, too, came without the accompanying vinegar and pepper; we had to ask (and wait some time) for them. The food itself was lacking in quality and cooked as if without much thought. Abalone was rubbery, vermicelli bland, chicken dry. Presentation was lacklustre too. That, however, was hardly all. The table was smelly and crockery dirty - we were even given a stack of bowls with sticky residue in it! Along with the rowdy atmosphere and terribly greasy floor, we might as well have been eating at a ‘zichar’ place - but with a S$300++ price tag. All in all one of the worst experiences I’ve had at a leading local Chinese restaurant chain.

Occupying the space of 3 shop houses, this Putien restaurant does not have a large and open dining area. The space is divided into zones for 4-top tables, large round tables and two more private dining areas. Parking is available at the nearby City Square Mall. Valet parking is also available.We ordered a Chinese New Year dinner package that included yusheng. The yusheng was large and the taste was very refreshing. Another great tasting dish was the deep-fried sea bass in tangy sauce. The specialty Putien Lor Mee was equally good.Two dishes missed the mark. The white mushrooms and asparagus dish was bland tasting and it was not served hot. The red bean soup dessert tasted diluted
4
Simple dishes but well executed. Bamboo shoots usually are one of the blandest things you can eat. But PUTIEN manages to make it a delicious dish thanks to its own recipe. Also, the squirrel fish in sweet and sour sauce is a classical dish they do very nicely.Quality overall is good and prices reasonable
5
Putien is always packed whichever outlet you patronize. It's because their food is consistent which is good for diners. We had a few dishes that day and live their fried Mee Sua. Full of flavour. The big intestine is nice, no offal smell, shredded pork with the sesame bun was delicious. Fully recommend this restaurant.
4
The food was good and different from many Chinese restaurants. We enjoyed the duck meat coated with fried crispy yam. Tofu dish, clam dish and fried yam dish were good too. Their signature fried bee hoon was irresistible though we were rather full towards the end of the dinner. Nice ambiance to dine in and good service as the pot of tea was frequently topped up. Courteous staff.Short walk from City Square Mall. We parked at the mall and it was good to take a short walk (few minutes) back to the mall for shopping after a full dinner
5
I like the white Lor Mee ,the fried bun with stewed pork and much more. The food are delicious and the chili in the restaurant also are the best.
4
There for dinner with family, service tip TOP, food comes very quick and good. Love the ambien, the service and good food, very different from all other outlet.
5
Putien has grown and spread to not only different locations in Singapore but also various other neighbouring countries. The Kitchener Road outlet is the place of origin. We have patronised it since its early days and we gladly return when we wish to have great Fujian Chinese cuisine. I have tried other outlets, but must say the Kitchener stands out - not just in terms of the quality of the dishes served but the truly great service that shines there. I hesitate to recommend dishes as everything is well done. Ask the server to recommend depending on your preferences
5
Having been eating in Putien for upteem years. And this one of the best restaurant which has kept their food standard consistently. After they received the Michelin star award, price has gone up slightly but it is still affordable.My all times favourite :-Starter - Drunken CocklesMain - Putien Lor MeeMeat - Swee Sour Pork with LyceeVeg - Stir Fried Yam, Spinach in Supreme StockBeverage - Barley and Winter Melon, Sweet Corn JuiceKeep it up Putien ! Thumbs up

Four of us went there for a birthday lunch. We ordered their signature dishes such as their seafood rice noodles, fish soup, garlic and baked clams (their clam festival). They now have a number of options for fruit/vegetable juices. We tried thier vegetable with soursoup and sour plum. All the dishes were very delicious. Service was courteous and prompt. They also provide valet parking.
4
The food came in a wide variety and was delicious, especially their "100 Second" Yellow Croaker Fish, Deep Fried Duck with Yam and the popular Heng Wa Bee Hoon. Although the price of the food was a little on the high side, the generous portion of the food made it value for money. The service staff were attentive and friendly and made a point to communicate with us. We had a satisfying lunch there and would definitely recommend this place to family and friend
4
Putien has a few branches in Singapore besides its main outlet on Kitchener Road. Offering gastronomically good Fujian food, its Parkway Patade outlet at the 2nd floor also boasts a family oriented environment with clean simple comfort and amiable service staff. Our extended family recently celebrated a Pioneer's birthday at the outlet special area and we all had a really joyous and enjoyable meal with extras like balloons and birthday fanfare thrown in by the service staff. Worth considering if you are having a celebratory gathering of friends and family

I cannot say I absolutely love this restaurant or it's a satisfying meal. It's definitely above average. I like the chili sauce which tastes something like the chili for chicken rice. Perhaps it's the mother's day dinner, the menu that was offered to me was the set meals. I was told I could order anything from the set menu as ala carte but I have no idea what to order. I suppose some recommendation somewhere would help me greatly. The lor mee does not have the wok hey like in zichar stall but it tastes pretty good. My kids love it. I don't enjoy the yellow cracker because it is filled with bones. Parents, beware when you order for your kids. The eel is very average for me as well. All in all, it cost sgd 178 for a family for two adults and two children. I would probably give this restaurant another shot to determine its value
5
Excellent place to dine in. Great services too. A bit pricey but the food is really good. If you want something different in Chinese Cuisine, then this is the place to go for. Try the bee hoon or vermicelli as it is packed with seafood and pork meat taste. Nice place and will re-visit
5
I have been to this restaurant a couple of times. I like the friendly attitude of the serving staff who help you around with the menu, The menu has all sorts of Chinese dishes which are not commonly found in the common Chinese eateries around town. One such thing that I was encouraged to try here was the deep fried Pig's Trotter. I ordered it nervously but it tasted amazing and I would surely have it again. I also love their golden sesame buns with shredded pork. Last time around I was encouraged to try their Lor Mee and I was not disappointed. The fresh seafood broth with mushrooms and a bit of sambal was a very satisfying meal. I must say their serving staff takes good care of the patrons. Despite being a Michelin restaurant now, the prices are not too high and it is a total value for money
5
there are peanuts mixed with seaweed. there a bun we can make ourself and it is quite fun to make one . it sell some noodles there to.
3
Tried the outlet at Parkway. Ordered the normal fried fish, fried Bee hoon. You need to dip the fried fish with garlic soya sauce and their special chilli sauce. The stir fried vegetable was too oily. Red fermented wine chicken is good.
5
I can see why this restaurant has a Mitchelin star. Great tasting food, and such good value. We had 5 dishes including the sweet and sour pork which was perfect, Men tofu which was delicious, yummy jellyfish salad. I was expecting a large bill but no; excellent value for the location and quality.
4
Went on a business dinner. Food was very good! Sweet & sour lychee pork was the best! Crispy chicken was moist and tasty! Wine list was below poor it had 7 choice 4 red and two whites. Only two Chardonnays in white with a huge price difference where it should not be since the wine are quite similar in year and type and of course the restaurant was out of the cheapest white wine at 7pm on a Wednesday and brought the most expensive white which not even chilled!! So we had beer and enjoy the food
4
Visited the outlet at Kitchener road for dinner. Food quality and taste was good, ordered their popular bee hoon, veggies with century egg, sweet sour fish and fried garlic chicken. Unfortunately, it took more 25 mins before the veggie dish was served, followed by the rest of dishes after another 20 mins wait. Kitchen service was painfully slow on a Monday night , however the outlet was almost fully seated . Service staff were courteous and attentive, food was good , made up for the long wait tonight 
5
At ION Orchard, for some work, and a spur of the moment decision to have a meal at Putien. And curiosity about a Michelin star restaurant. We were early enough to walk in, around 11:30 /12:00, on a weekend. Service was efficient. One of the orders, the Mee Sua, came rather late, we were almost through the meal. Customers need to be informed if a dish is going to take time, specially if it is one persons main meal. Luckily, the helpings of the other dishes, the Bee Hoon, prawn in vinegar starter and an excellent sweet and sour pork were generous enough. The teas were good, but I thought pricey. All the other bits, the peanuts, other munchies, wet towel, drinking water are all charged for. Again, the customer needs to be informed of these charges, however minimal they may seem. It's a courtesy. I would return, the food was good
4
First time for me. Heard so much about this from all my relatives and friends especially after this rest got its "star". Food and service is excellent. Very attentive and friendly staff all round. We tried most of their signature dishes and also hairy crab since it was in season. We will visit it again but it has to be once in a while otherwise it's too much of good food...must rotate palate and continue the fun of trying new unknowns to discover...:). Included some pics of starters. My favourite was the scalded blood cockles (see- hum) with fresh minced garlic in soya sauce. Yummy
4
Traveled to Singapore for over 25 years, but never ventured into this part of town (little India) and just could not bear to be swamped, so against the recommendations of the hotel porter ventured into this upmarket Chinese Resturant. A menu where signature dishes were on offer, a bit difficult if you are not an expert.Anyway. Some good well presented and tasty food was the outcome, will I go back? Undecided
4
Putien is an expanding venture in Singapore, and apart from the original restaurant on Kitchener Road, now has branches at Jurong Point, Raffles City, VivoCity, ION Orchard, Marina Square, Parkway Parade and Tampines Mall.We had dinner at the Parkway Parade branch, in the East Coast Park.Putien specializes in Heng Hwa food, which is in Fujian Province.We had fish soup in a mild ginger flavored broth, crispy fried taro, roast duck, glass noodles with small clam shells, fried prawn wanton sand stir fried green vegetables
5
This has to be one of the best Chinese restaurant in Singapore (and I say this even before it received its 1 Michelin Star!). I've been to this restaurant twice now upon invitation from a relative who does not live in Singapore but frequents this place whenever he and his family comes for a visit. I had a Premium Tie Guan Yin tea. Wow!! The tea was so fragrant and the taste was exquisite!! It has to be one of the best chinese tea I've ever had. Most recommended dish: the Putien clam, spinach with salted egg & century egg, homemade beancurd, deep fried pig's trotters, stir fried yam (my kids loved!!), heng hwa bee hoon.. The food served was very authentic & delicious!! Never knew Heng Hwa dishes were so tasty. Loved the ambience of Putien at Kitchener road. Nice for family and business dining. It's a lot more packed now after they got their Michelin 1 star. The service was great! Staff always served with a smile and always so helpful no matter how busy they were. Keep it up!
3
The waitress was friendly and introduced some new dishes straight from Putien. The dishes were average but the price was not. The food was pretty salty but overall, i will consider this a decent restaurant to visit if i have some budget.
5
I had my birthday dinner with my family in Putien Ion Sg restaurant. Excellent service from the staff. Food is very tasty.
4
Nice environment, service staffs was good except for one lady. They do many regulars there. She is more forecast on the regulars, as a new customer being neglected.
Food is good but is too saltish for some of their foods.

Putien @Kitchener Road received its 1 Michelin Star recently and we decided to try it out. We have been to different branches of Putien in Singapore. But the restaurant at Kitchener Road stood out.We called to make last minute reservations and they were very polite, told us the next available seating, and we did not have to wait long. Upon arrival, their valet staff were very quick to help take over our wheels due to parking inconvenience, and it was FOC.The lady serving us, Ah Lian, was full of smiles, and introduced us to their signature dishes, and history of the restaurant and food. The food was of good quality and tasted excellent. It was healthy HengHwa food.Upon hearing that we were here to celebrate birthdays, they prepared a surprise at the end of the meal. They sang birthday songs, gave a platter of fruits with candle, and presented small souvenir gifts. They even took our picture, and printed them for our keep. It was a nice touch from a Chinese restaurant.It was a very memorable occasion. Ah Lian went the extra mile to make her guests happy. She was very endearing, and we did not expect our simple meal to be so special. Indeed a nice, reasonably priced Michelin star restaurant. Keep up the great job

Putien ION currently advertise their Dim Sum afternoon promotion from 2.30 to 4.30pm. Obviously they don't want to serve you. Arriving there yesterday afternoon at 4.02pm, we were told by a very unfriendly receptionist that they were closed. We pointed at the poster right in front of that man, showing 2.30 - 4.30pm, to which he answered "last order is at 4pm". This is not mentioned anywhere. Then we highlighted it was 4.02, to which he answered again "the kitchen is closed, last order is at 4pm". That was one of the most terrible customer I experienced in a restaurant in Singapore. We had to go somewhere else and no need to say that I won't step foot again in Putie
5
Mostly seafood dishes. Apparently "Heng Hwa" style. Reasonable prices, cool and comfortable surroundings but not too posh. Friendly and helpful staff and while their English is not necessarily very good it's a whole lot better than my, or practically all UK's, Chinese. Probably not in the most fashionable part of town but highly recommended
5
We chose Putien in Raffles City as it was close to our hotel and we were running on fairly empty tanks having arrived the night before. We made our choice on the basis of the standard menu but were delighted on arrival to discover that New Year menus were still being offered. We were treated to a whole series of delights, the best being Deep Fried Pigs Trotters, all being brought forth from what seemed to be a very small kitchen.It was also a delight to be surrounded by lots of groups of Singaporeans really enjoying themselves.Despite the fact that the place was bursting at the seams service was friendly and efficient throughout.Not cheap, if you factor I beer and a bottle of wine, but one of those experiences that we will happily think back upon for a long time. The whole expe

Today went to Ion's Putien the waiter extremely rude I ordered set dinners for two, one medium lawmee & two pig trotters & when I ordered one pot of Chinese Tea he refused two give me a spare cup and give me the looks that I had no money to buy another pot of tea. Hey you know who you are not to mention how very rude you are to me your good customer when I started ordering till I left your restaurant, I frequent Ion's high end shops & restaurants never have this kind of encounter before, even I order one pot of tea you have to serve me with a smile because you are in service line and your boss must teach you that.Remember because of you I'll never visit Putien anymore. Your boss should get rid of you if not in no time all your customers will be gone haha
5
It's about time someone decided to take Crystal jade and Imperial Treasure in this category and Putien does it with finesse. A chinese cuisine found in the Fujian province, with a perfect amount of spice if you choose to have it. They do sell their own homemade chili to take home with you. Their food is consistently good and the price range is within the mid-range which makes this place one of the most ideal places for good quality chinese food
5
My Friend comes from Malaysia and her family is running the restaurant business which I am having headache where should I bring her for special food, she stay near to Farrer Park which I think of Putien the restaurant I love the most for Chinese food , I order signature Mee hon, bean curd with Chinese cabbage soup, yam, fried oyster which is the dish you can't miss out . All the food are great and delicious , Chili sauce is great and my Friend is really enjoy eating the food ordered. The staff is friendly and provide the good service to us, there are 3 nice fish tanks inside the restaurant which make the environment great :) . I really love the food from Putien which is not so salty if compare with other Chinese restaurant , I am going to try all the dishes they have :)
4
Excellent restaurant. Unique chinese cuisine hardly available elsewhere. Especially love the homemade chilli sauce.
3
My chinese colleagues took me out to this place. Food was ok but not overly warm. Service average but tge atmosphere not really inspiring. Good for a quick bite.
4
Have been going to Putien in Vivo city Singapore and Putien in kitchener road Singapore. Even tried the KL branch in one utama. The same dish has the same quality flavor in all 3 branches. So quality control is good and reasonably priced.I like to order cockles marinated in their special garlic sauce. Seaweed and shrimps, prawn in bamboo soup, yellow fish and fried mee hoon. The chili sauce is execellent. For drinks it would be the two green vegetable drinks. Very refreshing on a hot day
4
Visited their new branch at Ion Orchard on a Saturday for lunch. The restaurant, which is quite big as there are 'hidden' parts behind the main dining room, was full (for good reasons), but the high-tech Q-ing system allows you to wander around the mall while waiting. Fujian food is homey, peasant food, and Putien offers unusual, interesting dishes (seaweed soup with crabmeat and tofu, deep fried bamboo clams, braised intestines, pig trotters in jelly, etc). The drunken cockles are served in a garlic, ginger and chili sauce to die for. The Chinese mustard porridge is fragrant and yummy. This being an upscale location, the outlet is gentrified for the occasion: chic dÃ©cor, wine and single malt, Evian water...But it's still very good value, and the service staff is friendly and polite, even if not very pro-active
1
Visited their newly opened branch at Ion Orchard. It is the least occupied restaurant at level 4 and we soon knew the reason. Food portions are extremely small as are the seafood...I haven't seen smaller prawns and bamboo clams at any other reputable chain Chinese restaurant. Taste is horrid. Their Tik Guan Yin tea is extremely bland as well...mentioned this to the staff and was told it was meant to be that way...Honestly, this is the Chinese restaurant with the worst taste in the whole of Orchard Road..
4
Always thought this was an old fashioned place but pleasantly surprised. Some of the dishes was definitely unique, fried yams were tasty, appetizers were interesting too. Traditional cabbage soup went do well and the highlight for me was eating deep fried pig trotters with my gloved hand, definitely sinful but tasty. steamed fish was decent and the best part of it was a very reasonable price
4
Loved the incredibly interesting menu - you won't get much of the "run of the mill" stuff here. We had the cockles and bamboo clams which was prepared in special sauce (delicious), vermicelli was not outstanding but very good - all in all a great experience and we'll definitely visit again with friends
3
My elderly parents like to eat at this restaurant cause the dishes are like home cooked food. The sliced fish soup is yummy cooked in wine. They also have sweet and sour pork cooked with lychee. The Hinghua bee hoon cooked with clams is delicious. There is also hairy crab and you can have a choice of Chinese tea. You can also choose to order set meal for four, etc. I will recommend this place for family and friends
1
Have been living close to this space for about 4 years and have gone periodically for light CHINESE cooking. However the service has become very neglectful and rude. Waited 10 min before anyone even acknowledged we were in the restaurant and I had to ask someone to get me tea. I have been to many Chinese restaurants of all regionality and they always offer tea within the first 5 min of being sat
3
Bee Hoon - Pretty good.Lor Mee - No. Don't bother.Cockles in Drunken Cockles - Tiny (size of cockles, not portion). Even Lau Pa Sat's cockles are bigger. I like the garlic but not the chilli that went with the marination. Why must u spoil it with the stupid chilli? Ah Yuan Herbal Chicken - No. Don't order. It's a waste of money and stomach space. You're better off with Crystal Jade/Din Tai Feng's drunken chicken. Though the portion was much bigger than CJ or DTF, the quality was just crap. Seriously, Putien, you there? Homemade bean curd - Good, but not blow-my-mind kinda level. My mom can cook this too. Spinach with Salted Egg & Century Egg in Supreme Stock - While I never like this dish at most restaurants, PuTien had done a great job for it. This dish was really smooth and gave a very generous portion of salted egg gravy. So THUMBS UP!Deep Fried Duck with Yam - This dish is the reason I went to Putien; and was sorely disappointed by it. Though i must say the yam portion was very thick, which kinda comforted me. The duck was too dry. Why were there bones in it?? Come on!Squirrel Fish - OK. Just like any other restaurant's.Desserts - Ordinary, but it's not too sweet. So i'm happy in a way
5
We went for a lunch on a weekday, but the restaurant was pretty much filled up. Foods were excellent. I have ordered century eggs, clams, fried fish and some noodles. All of them were perfect. Staffs were kind and attentive.
3
Food's okay, maybe slightly above average. Seems a little understaffed though so service is rather slow.
Ordered: century egg - it's the sweet and sour kind. Lor mee - pretty alright. Cockles - again a bit sweet.
Oyster omelette - crispy - quite alright.
4
My favourite Chinese Restaurant, especially Fried Heng Hwa Bee Hoon and Mackerel Fish, Sweet and Sour Fish. Also like their take away offer at $5.50 for a packet of Bee Hoon, Mee etc. My family and friend from overseas never regret of the food they tasted. It simply delicious.
4
Just lunch there a few days ago. The food was good. Recommended is there spinanch with salted and century egg with supreme stock - trust me this is good. Also recommended is their fried Heng Hwa Bee Hoon, Deep Fried Yam and their special Yam/Coconut Ice Cream (dessert). I like their service as in when they serve you the Hairy Crab, they also assist you in removing the legs, pushing up the crab meat so that you can simply suck it up. You would certainly have to pay a price for all these service
3
With friends, decided to try out the one at Parkway Parade. Crowded as it was a Sunday during lunch time. We tried the 'set' menu at $138 for 4 persons.I only found the 'Soon Hock' fish and the bamboo shoots (lightly fried) nice.The pork was sweet and sour but I found it lacking.They have their own version of 'sambal balachan' in a special container, but, nothing special in taste. The service was very good and prompt.Over it was ok
4
Visited Putien at Tampines Mall for lunch on a weekday. It was already past 1pm, thus not much crowd. Service was efficient.We ordered the usual dishes that we liked.- Sweet & sour pork with lychees : meat was tender- Stir-fried yam : crispy on outside, fluffy inside- Shredded pork with golden sesame bun : the sesame bun was crispy and soft, the pork was delicious with the sweet onions- Homemade bean curd : smooth and silky- Spinach with salted egg & century egg in supreme stock : the stock was flavourfulRecommend for family if you want good and simple food
5
We visited the restaurant at Vivo City for lunch on a weekday. It was busy but not crowded. The waitress found us a window side booth dining table that looked across to Sentosa Island. We ordered a few of their specialty dishes. Menu had well-taken photos of dishes which described the dishes better than their menu descriptions.The fried Heng Hwa bee hoon was tastefully done. Spinach with salted egg and century egg went well with steamed rice. Stir-fried yam was nicely sweet on the outside. The fried buns went well with the accompanying stir-fried shredded pork and onion. Their specialty Squirrel fish with sweet and sour sauce was deep-fried until crispy on the outside and not overly dry inside. The fish was very good and filleted without the bones.Lunch was leisurely with mostly shoppers and a few tables of office workers. Dishes were served at an unhurried pace. Restaurant's ambience is comfortable with a mix of seating options comprising booth seating, table of 10s in partitioned sections, and an open dining area
5
Visited Putien at Vivocity. It was almost full. Luckily we got a table for the 4 of us. Two adults and two kids. Place was VERY clean. Service was efficient. Menu in both Chinese and English, with pictures too which I find very helpful. They have various Chinese tea leaves, that was excellent. Try their "home made" sweet corn drink. It was yummy. SGD6 for a glass. We ordered 3 dishes and 3 rice. Spent around SGD86. A bit expensive but it was money well spent. We enjoyed tge food, the ambience (not recommended if one is looking for a romantic meal for two). Would definitely go back for more
4
We went to the outlet at Vivocity to celebrate my mother's birthday....As no reservation was made and it was a Saturday, we initially ended up at a booth table which was abit cramped for 6 adults and 2 children.... The staff asked us to look at the menu and decided on our orders first... They will change us to a round table when it was available....We waited for less than 10 minutes before we were shifted.... not too bad I would say...After ordering our food, we waited a while.... but the food was served almost one after another.... such that our table could not accomodate all the dishes.... as it was quite small... Now we know we definitely need to make reservation so that we can get a nice big round table with partition...All the dishes we ordered were splendid and we enjoyed them.... especially the deep fried squirrel fish.... Highly recommended
4
The food is much above average and is worth the price. However if you go to the restaurant on a weekend or evening weekday, you might have to queue up and wait for a vacent seat. Service can be rather slow when the restaurent is full thoug
3
I love the food here, but it has gotten very much pricer over the last years, so I have stopped eating here. For the same price I can get better food elsewhere...
5
Have wanted to try this chain for ages and never managed to quite catch the right time (they sometimes have scheduled sittings) - my oh my - was certainly worth the wait - beautiful seaweed dishes and veg, delectable pork ribs (melt in the mouth no trace of fat)... taro/yam with duck .... clam noodles .... so much I want to go back and try! This will definitely become a family favourite! From the website "The PUTIEN brand name has its roots traced to Putian, a beautiful coastal town located in the Fujian province of China. Surrounded by spectacular ocean views and majestic mountains, Putian is blessed with lush pastures and bountiful catches from the sea.
4
Went to branch at NEX serangoon. Was with family of 4 adults and 2 children. Spent around $110. Fried bee hoon and lor mee (wet noodles) are must tries. Not expensive. Ordered toufu and vegetables for kids. Both dishes were well cooked. Had pig intestines for starters - delicious but pricy at around $12 for a few pieces. Spent almost $20 for 5 buns with shredded pork - nice but too expensive. Would only return if there are discounts
5
Chinese friends from the same place in China, Putien, took us to this place fro dinner. All the food was very tasty, and they agreed to accomodate my vegan diet. We had fresh fruit and barley juices, bitter guard, snow peas with garlic, fried yams, tofu, 2 types of noodles and one sticky rice with vagetables dish and the carnivors had chicken with garlic and duck . The only thing that I didn't like was the terrible acoustics which didn't allow us to hear each other, but if you are interested just in the food - this place is heavan
4
One of the most outstanding dishes is the roast pettitoes!! Very crunchy and crispy outside yet soft and chewy inside. If I were to rate for the food, I'd give a whole five star. Service was poor but quick, as expected in a chinese restaurant. I recommend the pork dishes
4
was at Tampines Mall for their value set lunch.value set lunch at $12.90++, but only at RWS & Tampines Mall, normal weekdays, 11.30 to 3pm. you get to choose 3 cold dishes, one main dish and 1 desert.cold dishes & yam paste were very good, I like especially the drunken cockles. very generous portion, really value for money, and they gave me one whole pot of chrysanthemum tea just for $1.20. staff were friendly and service was fast
1
Had dinner in the branch at Vivo City. Tasteless dÃ©cor and terrible ambience. Do not take a so-called private room - There was nothing private about it except for the partial frosted glass between the tables on 2 sides. To use this table, they insist that the bill must be more than $500 and they added 3 bowls of Buddha jumps over the wall soup at an exorbitant $70 each! The soup was think and tasted strange. Daylight robbery!The service was appalling. Dishes thrown on our table rudely. Our plates were not changed at all even after many courses. When we asked for clean plates, this was very ungraciously done. The food was mediocre except for a few dishes which were quite decent - Putien century egg, eggplant with floss, squirrel fish, duck with yam
4
My colleagues & I treated ourselves to Heng Hwa food at Putien Restaurant at Kitchener Road in February this year. Great food! We had the yummy stir-fried yam, mouth-watering stir-fried meat with bun, delicious claypot chicken in fermented red wine, fried homemade beancurd, "so-so" Putien lor mee and fried heng hwa beehoon. Service were great and we had a good time! However, we got stares from our other colleagues cos we were very late for the bonding session at the Arts hub at Goodman that afternoon
3
We visited the Putien restaurant within Resorts World, Sentosa, Singapore. Staff were very efficient arranging a table for 2 and the food arrived quickly and was generally of a high standard, though a little expensive for Singapore. A small starter dish was placed on our table and we were invited to try it. Even though we didn't order it, we were charged for it and I found it quite unpleasant to eat. Not sure what it was, but it was black and may have been mushroom. There were also 2 handwipes in sealed packets on the table which we used and we were charged for them as well! Not a lot of money, but I left the restaurant feeling cheated and the experience had been ruined. I will never return to any of the Putien restaurants on principle

I live in Hong Kong and typically we find Hong Kong to be the benchmark for all Chinese food. Occasionally you will find a place that is up to that challenge and Putien is one of them. The restaurant is clearly trying new concepts and had a special winter dishes menu - in the tropical heat of Singapore!! But it works. These were all lovely dishes and we tried many to test the restaurant out. What usually defines a quality restaurant is also the tea. The Tit Kum Yum (Iron Buddha) tea was first class and served in a traditional cup that allowed the tea to soak in the ever present hot water. Service was friendly and we just enjoyed the whole experience. For those into Tofu and Abalone this is a great place to find

Generous serving n delicious, fresh ingredient food.
Tried their seasonal hairy crabs at a very reasonable price but quality not being compromised.

is still the better of the chain. More authenticity. Food is same-o same-o. Honestly nothing to brag about...but beats some big names handsdown. Contradicting? no. You've gotta taste the food to know what I mean. :)

This is nice restaurant and they have so many outlet in singapore, I like it. been few of their outlet in different location, all dishes are nice.

This was the second time we have eaten here and the food was still good and reasonably priced. We had the century egg starter, which interestingly enough was fried and yet tasted good. The sweet and sour pork was rather so-so, and the mee sua noodles were a little bland. But the ribs and the fried fish were excellent

Very interesting cooking and quite different than the usual Chinese we get in Malaysia and Singapore otherwise. Their signature chilli sauce is pretty amazing on most of their dishes. My favourites were the fried century eggs, the fried bun with stewed pork, and the stewed sweet potato noodles. Service is pretty abrupt and curt as is usually the case in a lot of Asian restaurants but that's the norm so don't let that put you off

I've been to several of their outlets in Singapore, and have not been disappointed. The food is always consistently great, considering that I like to order the same dishes. The Kitchener Rd branch somehow makes the best renditions of the dishes, though. The food is, according to its website, is native to "Putian, a beautiful coastal town located in the Fujian province of China". It's unlike the typical Chinese food in Singapore, which is more Hokkian, Hakka, or Teochew-influenced.My favorites are the sweet and sour pork with lychees, the drunken cockles, braised pig intestines, spinach with salted egg and century egg in supreme stock, homemade beancurd, Putien mee sua, ca fen.I like to bring visitors and friends here, and so far all of them have been impressed by the food.Their Kitchener Rd branch is always very busy, so make a reservation

This review is for the Putien in Nex mall.Must order items...Drunken cockles (ask for less garlic, if not they will pile it on) - a cold refreshing way to serve cocklesSea cucumber in claypot - generous cuts of tender sea cucumber braised in a rich flavorful sauceSweet & sour squirrel fish - done to perfection, fresh and crispy with a tangy sauceDeep fried yam with duck - crispy on the outside with mushy yam encasing a succulent piece of duck breastHomemade tofu - silky soft and yummyItems not to bother with...Hing Hwa fried vermicelli - very ordinaryPumpkin with baby shrimp (from autumn menu) - although pumpkin was very soft, sauce was blandLunch for 6 with tea including all the extras was about $160 was more than worth it considering restaurant had a posh feel despite being in the mall. Wait staff were very helpful and friendly. Food was of a high quality, skilfully cooked and artistically presented ( I'm referring to the fish). P.S. their killer chilli in little pots on every table is to die fo

i have tried the food in Putien, One Utama KL before and we decided to bring our parents to Putien in Jurong Point singapore since we are there and they will prefer chinese meal.We order a soft tofu white cabbage soup, a squirrel fish, herbal shrimp, their famous ice bitter gourd and their mihun.They gave a set of cutlery for my little nephew and he is so happy as he has his own set to used.They presentation of the food is very nice and i like the squirrel fish the most.The waitress is very considerate to place the food far away from my little nephew and will help to serve the soup into small bowls before serving to us and will help to clean up the dish after we finish it immediately.The price is affordable and food is nice....Just a small comment, if the soft tofu is braised longer, it will taste even better....the one i tried in KL is much better but overall the food quality is almost the same in KL...

Actually thought that this must be a new trendy restaurant only to find out it is a chain of about 9 outlets in Singapore, mainly in Malls - this one is not - this in Kitchener Road 5 mins from Farrer Park and City Mall. dishers are more Dim Sum size, quite small at around S$9/10 per portion. BUT very tasty and very well presented. Had "drunken Cockles" amazingly lightly cooked - very fresh , fine noodles and tiny shrimp plus a seaweed concoction - slightly sweet!Suggest that if you are adventurous and want something different give this a go. might have wine only by the bottle, possibly white or possibly red !

We made a reservation at the Jurong Point branch 1 hour before heading down for dinner. And the table was ready once we reached and big enough to cater 8 adults and a baby. We ordered 8pax menu for dinner. Overall the food was good and come with good presentation for each serving. Service is good but a bit expensive for the total bill

i tried their home made bean curd which was the best ever. highly recommended chinese restaurant
5
The food are very good, authentic and reasonably price. Do try their steam sea bass, it's good.

You wont be disappointed at this good chinese restaurant. They have multiple locations in the city.
Make sure you try the green tea.

restaurant specialty bee hoon is not a hit with me. don't get why so many rave abt it, liked its fried fish though. highly overpriced =X
5
The food were really good. We love that their portions are on the smaller side, but well-priced. This means we could order more variety. Every single dish was very well presented and tasted delicious. Must try the pork trotters, deep fried fish, yam cake, and double boiled soup. Actually, everything was good!! Service was very prompt and we got dish after dish without having to wait too long, or having them all on the table. Will definitely be back

The Putien chain looks from outside like many of the Chinese restaurant chains you see sprouting all over Singapore. No glam renovation, no consistent branding and vrey little if any marketing,,,,just relying on its location and convenience to attract passing by lunch crowds, or so we always thought as we must have walked past Putien in a few of the shopping malls without much thought of actually going in to try, just like the many passerbys.One fine day, we decided to hop in for a quick lunch esp as it was not crowded unlike the usual crowds queuing up at Crystal Jade and what a satisfying lunch.The must-tries include :1) the house speciality Lor mee, the gravy was nice and savoury and not as thick as the local singapore lor mee but more reminscent of the authentic lor mee you get in Fujian province in China. Delicious esp as it followed the seafood based lor mee by having clams etc. We slurped every strand of the white noodle and gravy.2) the home-made tofu was probably one of the best we have eaten but at S$10, it was a steal. The inside was fine and the outside was lightly fried, so yummy...3) But the best dish of all was the fried mackerel fillets. Simply lightly salted and fried, this is by no means an expensive fish and its flesh is usually firm and robust, ideal for light-frying, Cantonese style. We were glad the restaurant didnt try to be too creative with this dish and just let the true robust taste of the mackerel shine on its own merit. 4) the fried beehoon looks tantalising on the menu but was disappointing in taste compared to the lor mee. Too plain.5) the spinach with 3 eggs was very nice-done, savoury and yummy and still retaining that crunchy taste of spinach, not too soggy.We loved and missed this mackerel fish so much, we went back a few days later just to eat the fillet.The deserts are forgetable. Service is average but for a food chain, it was good to eat such good fare at such affordable fare with no crowds

(Starter) Chicken and chinese sausage roll: interesting dish.Spinach with salted egg and century egg in supreme stock: I liked this as the two types of eggs complemented the vegetables well.Homemade beancurd: The tofu was smooth but that's about it. It's something my maid can cook. Homemade, indeed.Deep fried duck with yam: This was unique as I had never tried duck together with yam. To add on to it, the yam was very very soft so you could chew both meat and yam together. However, the accompanying sauce was totally tasteless.Seafood fried rice: Totally not worth the price and stomach space. It should have been called just "fried rice". The prawns were in such tiny bits that you really don't taste them. Where was the other seafood?

In the past, we used to frequent the restaurant in Kitchener Road. Now with up to 9 locations, such as NEX serangoon, we decided recently to visit Marina Sq branch due to ample parking. 8 of us went there for dinner on Public Holiday, fortunately, we made a reservation. Table given to us was a bit too small for all of the food we ordered. One side plate had chilli stain and needed some time to get attention of staff to replace it. We ordered our favourite lor mee (noodle soup cooked with seafood) with mian sian (very fine noodle). it was tasty and full of flavours. The fired bee hoon remains as good as ever, this was accompanied with side dishes from their winter selection : pork jelly, chicken with chinese sausages and mutton with white radish in a pot (winter dishes). The fried horse mackerel portion was just nicely sliced and fried to perfection. Total bill was less than SGD 150, although meal was light, I would consider it value for money.Concern I have is standard of service is falling and may be difficult to maintain food standard with so many branches now when compared to its early days in Kitchener Road. Still, one of the best places for genuine Heng Hwa food in a restaurant setting. Do order your selection with right portions in mind, ask for assistance when ordering if not sure

Few months back, we had dinner at Marina Sq with some overseas friends. I left my credit card at the cashier's counter and instructed to charge the meal to my card. After dinner, when I asked for the bill, I was told that my guest had paid for the bill and I felt so angry & embarassed. How could the staff be so careless?Two nights back, we had dinner at Kitchener Rd branch the meat of the Soon Hock was powdery and yet the staff & cook claimed that it is very fresh when all of us said it was bad. To make matters worse I was double billed for tea. For such behaviour and service, do you think I would ever go back

It was packed that Friday night that I went. I had initially made a reservation at 8pm, and I thought if I was there early (I was there at 7.30pm), I could sit at the table and wait comfortably for my friends to arrive. Unfortunately, early birds do not always get it good as I was forced to sit outside in the sweltering heat. I was only let in at 8.10pm. Fortunately, the food helped to alleviate my otherwise foul mood. The "mee sua" was excellent and so were the kou rou" and "tofu". Plus, this delightful waitress (she asked us to call her Ah Lian, but we decided to call her Lian jie out of respect for her age) definitely made my day. I would most definitely go back again for the food and for her delectable service
