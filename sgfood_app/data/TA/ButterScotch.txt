Food was great, service was so so from cashier, waitress was better than cashier staff.
I love their dessert selection

Initially I didn't expect to find this location of any interest and even did I expect to find such a restaurant. The ambiance was cosy, food was delicious, desert was special. Very good experience.
5
This is my second time. So far I feel satisfic with the service and the food. I would recommend my family and friends to go this place

This happens to be my second time here but im afraid the savour dishes were abit dry and overcooked. However, the dessert s i had is till on point!

Good selection of food, amazing taste, great value as there are set meals for dinner which includes drinks.

Nice restaurant set-up for a small space. Food is nice. Price is compatible with other restaurants that offer similar food. Located at Bukit Merah Central, Singapore. If you're there, try it.

I had a terrible experience here. Will never come back, staff was rude and the food, exceptionally upsetting.
3
Food was pretty ok and service was acceptable. But the price of the food is on the high side and honestly not very worth it.
3
Came with high expectations after reading rave reviews and following their social media. The presentation of the food were nice and looked really delicious. However, I was left very disappointed with the service of the restaurant. It could have been due to miscommunication but it would be nice without those unexpected deviations. While my visit wasn't up to expected, would like to give it another try if I'm ever in the vicinity again

Had been craving for waffles, pancakes and ice creams for days. Finally drop by to ButterScotch, a muslim owned cafe. Friendly staff, great service, fast and yummylicious! Tried Anna Pavlova & Chocolate Ecstacy.The verdict? Anna Pavlova which is made up of 2 tiers of meringue, a mini pancake with creams and topped with vanilla ice cream and surrounded by strawberries is super fulfilling! The meringue is the best ever! It melts nicely in the mouth, just the perfect consistency. Great for those who is not looking for overly sweet dessert.Chocolate Ecstacy will get you high with its all chocolatey taste. The chocolatey hot waffles topped with vanilla is sure to satisfy your sweet tooth!For those who had mains, it's wise to share those desserts or else you'll not be able to finish it up.We ordered drinks of Orange juice with peppermint leaves, super refreshing and mango mix cranberry juice with peppermint leave is my absolute favourite! Will drop by again for the mains soon! Keep it up

The staff were nice and the food is totally worth it. Tried the tomyum pasta and ondeh ondeh waffles and it was SOOOOO nice, will totally visit the cafe again.
4
Tried their chili crab cake burger snd chocolate ecstasy waffle.. taste good..worth a try. Would go back again to try other dishes in their menu. However, the restaurant itself is not very big. Try to avoid peak period.
4
We enjoyed cakes - came here just for dessert but noticed quite a few delicious mains on the menu. Will make a trip to try some dishes out! Service was great too!
3
It was a good brunch place. The food wasn't that splendid.. The poached eggs weren't done well at all but I enjoyed how crispy the toast was & I think my friend enjoyed her chicken. Service was good though.
4
Great service! We really enjoyed our lunch at Butterscotch. The Ondeh Ondeh waffles were awesome! Must try!
5
The food was served in large portions at a standard cafe price. The staff were friendly and easy-going.

Love the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict so so much, my favourite. The bread was crispy and the eggs benedict were delicious. Also ordered the cheese wedges, bbq wings and ondeh2 waffles with Ice-cream. Very generous with their cheese and it tastes so good. Bbq wings is also a must try, very unique taste. Ondeh2 waffles can be eaten by 2 or 3 people, it's really filling. Can really taste the ondeh2 taste which is good. Price wise I feel that it's quite expensive but for that kind of taste and portion, i dont mind.

1) Beef Bolognse SGD 15 - I think this is not bad. There is a chilli aftertaste to it. The portion is okie. 2) Root beer float SGD 6.50 - I did not know would come in a plastic cup. I thought it would come in a glass cup . The cup needs to be chilled in a fridge before the float is made. That's the best way I know to do a root beer float. Ah well..

The chicken chop was amazing, with generous servings of potato wedges and coleslaw. It is one of two items you can get 1-for-1 with the Entertainer app promo. Chicken was grilled just nice with firmness and slightly charred skin. Best part is the ondeh ondeh waffle dessert. Ice cream is local favourite chendol, and the waffle mix isn't your typical ingredient. It will delight you when you put it inside your mouth
4
The food was really really good undoubtedly. Service was good as well but our food arrived quite late after ordering. Maybe because the cafe was full and we were among the last to place our orders. Did not get to try their desserts but will definitely visit again to try them. Overall it was a pleasant visit to butterscotch cafe. Kudos

Overpriced for average food. Ambience and service is not bad.
Funny to see so many dislike their services, it's actually fine but their food quality and quantity is really average for the price they charge, premium for halal prehaps.
5
Our second time. Love this place - food and service were really good. Will be back again - soon! Stay cool guys!

Dark and cramped cafe. Poor attitude from one staff. Wanted to try but total deterrent. Walked out, i would not come back again.
5
Great service, awesome food and extremely friendly staff. this plac is a must try especially for brunch. The Egg Benedict with waffle and turkey bacon is heavenly!
4
Thumbs up! It's a hidden gem along Bukit Merah and the ambiance is very nice. Cafe is small but still okay. Staff are very warm and attentive. Surprisingly their coffee and cakes are nice too! :)
5
The food is awesomely delicious. Its a bit pricey but nonetheless good food is equals to good price.

Love the food and cakes.
The ice cream flavours were cool but not that fantastic. They were alright and could be better.
5
Service was fast and efficient. Food was amazing. The cakes and dessert are out of this world. Spoilt for choice.

We got to know about this place via Instagram. So, we decided to check this place out. The shop is located at the extreme corner. For first timer like us, we had some trouble finding it as we are not familiar with this area. Anyway, we were lucky as we managed to escape the lunch crowd which was after 2PM. The portion of the food was just nice and we fell in love with the eggs benedict & the french toast! It was really, really good. I believe the owner must have traveled to a lot of places as their food tastes authentic and the price is reasonable too. We will definitely come back, should we crave for eggs ben & french toast

I have patronised this cafe 3 times. Thus far, food was good on all three occasions. However, this was the first time I was ever chased out of a restaurant because our "reservation time was over" after 2 hours. I mean, sure we took our time chatting and eating our food. The fact that we took our time showed how agreeable the place was for a meet up. So we were quite dumbfounded when we were told to leave. That after having our mains, desserts and we even bought more takeaways to bring home. Really a poor way to treat your customers. Otherwise, all staff were polite throughout. Perhaps I should not have faulted the staff, it could be the management

Overall, the food, ambiance and the service were good. It is worth the price. It is satisfactory! :)
5
It will be nice if u guys add Lamb chop and some steaks into the menu.. Overall 5 star for u guys.. Classüëçüèæ

Always delivered the best food. Very satisfying. Alhamdulillah. Keep up the excellent quality and service.

Excellent place! Thumbs up. Love the environment. Will have a come back with family soon! Recommended!

Butterscotch needs to improve on their burgers. Very dry beef patty. Crumbles on your plate. Not worth the price
2
Bad service. i truly feel that the pricing was too steep and it is just overrated. Coffee was not bad tho.
4
Conducive atmosphere... A good way to end a tiring day after Amazing Race. The ice cream was simply superb. Thank you!
5
Same great atmosphere and food everytime. Although the quality seemed to have declined a little, nevertheless, enjoyable ambience and extremely filling Plates of food!

I have went to many cafe in Singapore before but this place is by far my favourite. But this is still my opinion, others might not share the same opinion as me. The food is so far the best with the price justified. Even the desserts will make you drool and I don't usually have desserts. I give my thumbs up to this place

My hubby & I were sick and had gone to visit doctor in Bukit Merah. The doctor told us to take medicines soon with some food. As both of us were feeling nauseated, we thought we could have toast & tea to take medicines. As Butterscotch was just behind the doctor's clinic we went there and requested for toast. They told us they serve only French toast. We tried telling them that we are willing to pay the price for French toast but give us plain toast as we were not in position to eat anything heavier. How difficult was just toasting bread instead of making French toast? But they simply refused. We left and had toast at the hawker centre. Needless to say, we won't return.

My 1st time there. Food portion is good. Overall quite satisfied. Friendly staff and very cosy environment :)
5
Small yet comfy and cozy environment with awesome food. The waffles were soft and delicious. Definitely worth the $!
5
Arrived early despite booking reservation at 8pm. Was served in a quick & efficient manner. Did not have to wait long for the food to arrive. Food was delicious and came with big portion which we did not finished. Love the desserts!
4
The chef recommendation dish - chicken chop with eggs with mushrooms sauce is awesome! üëçüèª Keep up the good job!
3
Clearly the quality (and quantity for one dish I tried) of the food is not deserving of the price tag.
5
i love every part of this dining! Although it was raining and we were lost, the moment we stepped into the cafe till we stepped out, we loved and enjoyed every second of it. Love it so much and I'm definitely coming back again!
4
The food is really good and worth the share. I am sad that the Onen onen waffle wasn't available however, the butterscotch souffl√© still made my day. Thank you.
5
Man food was really nice. Atmosphere was great. Service was good. Would visit again. Overall give it a solid 10
5
The tom yam or laksa pasta is a must try! Not only does it look good, it tastes good too! It's a nice place to chill and have a cuppa.
5
Nice food and ambience. Cosy setting. Sat at table 1, abit cramped though because of the water dispenser beside it. Service wise it would be better if our orders were taken at the table instead of having to go to the counter to order and make payment. Staff was pleasant and nice. Overall nice dining experience!
