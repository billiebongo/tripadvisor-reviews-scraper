Service here is so so. Not as friendly.
Food wise, we got the platter to share and sausages were great but the other items were quite average and didnâ€™t justify the price.
Beers here are good though.

Great place to have real German food. If you want to eat something else than Asian this place is a treasure

Went for a very German meal and was happy to see the consistently great service and food. Pork knuckle is as good as in Germany and so is the beer. Strongly recommend and I will return.

The Brotzeit menu has become disappointing! Where are the real German dishes, like Schweinsbraten (Braised Pork), Goulash or the various Schnitzel's? Ok, there are pork knuckle and sausages but this you can get somewhere else and cheaper. Why is there so much chicken on the menu now? To eat roasted chicken, I would no go necessarily to a German restaurant.However, beer and wine selection is great. For food, I would recommend the Brotzeit platter and the Nuremberger sausages. Service is prompt but not overly friendly. If you want to go to Brotzeit with a large group better make a reservation, especially on the weekends

aircon upper floor not open till dinner time. non air-con ground floor was rather sunny and warm (minimal aircon from the mall coming out) service was slow but generally polite. took some time bef someone showed me to a table, i had to ask for menu when nobody attended to me. my tenderloin took ages ages to come (300g $48++) i thought they forgot my order. it was tender and i love steaks. portion was filling for 1. the starter of 2 tiny slivers of bread and cheese dip $9++ could do with more bread
2
We booked a table for 6 pax at 6.00pm. We were not allowed to go to upstair (with air-con) at 5.45pm. When we went up at sharp 6pm, we saw a table with guests that was obviously been eating and drinking for some time. The whole floor (upstair) was empty except with only that table. The Chinese waitress was rude as when we request to add a pax. We ordered beer, pork knuckle, sausage, pork wrap, fried mushroom and pizza. Pork Knuckle was yummy but the service was bad

If you dont want to ruin your day, dont dine at somerset branch. Service was very lousy. Missed our order. Call for assistance twice but no action done. Beer was serve not chilled but the staff never inform us before serving. Only when we call the manager to explain why not chilled then she start to apologise and tell all her alibis. Not worth it at all.

It's European Bar & Restaurant . For me , no more better bar to sit there in that area . It's good with friends or colleagues for some leisure time . I prefer to drink dunkel beer if u like a little bit strong taste of beer ...

Brought my nephew there for his birthday dinner. We ordered the pork platter for 3-4 pax, which came with pork knuckle, various sauages and pok ribs. It was awesome. I never like sausages but after eating theirs, it changed my mind. We have also ordered the white asparagus salad. The salad tastes fine but nothing very special about the white asparagus. The service is good too.I would like to try the mash potatoes on my next visit
5
A little hard to find from within 313 orchard shopping centre road -like a back door on level 1 but downstairs much nicer in an open courtyard or outside dining area. Service is prompt and efficient , Food particularly pork knuckle just superb, steak good quality and perfectly cooked, sauces both dishes very good. If I was to whinge -normally with pork knuckle is a type of bread stuffing -not with this dish -beer not cheap $SIN 13.50 half litre but cold and delicious -proper German beer. Overall $SIN 130 dollars two people -not cheap but worth it for the pork knuckle alone
3
Somwhat disappointed with this outlet, which is situated amongst other bars and food outlets in Somerset 313. The settings are utilitarian and yet they charge a lot of money for a small (0.6l) beer.
4
Beer was cold, I ordered the Pork knuckle. It came with saurkraut and potato salad. Nice presentation, food was tasty, service was good. I highly recommend a visit if looking for some German eats in SG. It's in the 313 mall off orchard road.
2
Ordered a spinach pizza, baguette, shank and a desert. Food quality was mediocre and service took an age. Good selection of beer, though. Many better choices at this price point
4
We ate dinner here, as food was so nice.German beer was perfect. Absolutely worth going again and again.

Been away from Munich for too long and missing Bavarian beers. Chanced upon Brotzeit in Orchard Road at lunchtime on Sunday. Enjoyed the specials on Franziskaner and Lowenbrau at $10 instead of $15 for 500ml. Matched them to a satisfying breakfast of cheese sausages, bacon, sunny side eggs, grilled onions and tomato. Service was friendly and helpful. Excellent pit stop for German brew and bite on the Orchard trail

It was a hot Saturday afternoon and me and my husband went to Brotzeit for lunch. It was walking disatnce and we decided to foot it. We ordered some Germen Reisling which was superb. I ordered some Carrot soup which was yummy and also a lovely salad. My husband also loved his salad. The serves were generous, service very good though a bit slow. All in all it was a great Saturday afternoo
4
The restaurant is at 313 mall near to Somerset MRT. It is at the level 1 and near to the famous garette popcorn stall and marche move n pick restaurant.Brotzeit has outdoor and indoor dining area. Outdoor dining area is along the busy walkways of 313 mall and indoor area is one level above the outdoor area. All food stuff including desserts are freshly made and we can feel the warmth and freshness.Variety of drinks including alcohol and German beers are selling in this restaurant.Price is almost same with the other restaurants in that area. Considering the food quantity and quality, price is medium range.A must try restaurant who loves German beer and sausage

Went there for dinner on Christmas Eve and it was great! Felt somewhat like home. Original German beer. Dishes were great. Portions look a bit small at first but don't be afraid, they suffice! Also they look just as great in reality as on the menu. Prices are quite high but okay, main dishes starting from 20-30S$ plus tax and service charge. Our waiter was not the friendliest but professional. Unfortunately, the aircon was so loud we couldn't hear the christmas music in the background but that is basically the only thing I can criticize.Will definitely go there again when feeling homesick

I am from Switzerland but i am quite often in town as my wife is a Singaporean. After some weeks of local food i always feel like having some special food and especially German wheat beer.This time i was very disappointed as the changed the wheat bear brand from Paulaner to Franziskaner. To eat i had the sausage platter. The sausages were ok but the 'sauerkraut' was more like cole slaw which i don't like at all. Service was okay. I won't go anymore because of the beer brand change which means i will frequent the Paulaner Microbrewery at Suntec City from now on
2
I spend every night here 3 years ago when i was staying in Mandarin Orchard. This trip, i make a trip back to this as i have enjoyed myself very much before. Regretfully, i was very disappointed. The pork knuckle was tasteless and worst, the beer was warm
4
We had the lunch menu, which was good and reasonably priced. You can sit outside. The usual German fare of sausages, but also chicken filet, fish etc
3
Loved the pork knuckle and sausages platter, and also the weissbier. But the restaurant was filled with people on a Friday night, had a very long waiting time, service was rather slow... But still, really loved the food!
3
Great spot to chill! Well represented German cuisine! Great chain restaurant and we'll worth going to with co-workers and friends.
4
What a relaxing place to dine and drink with old friends and work buddies. The prices are surprising but the serving sizes more than makes up for it. Probably expected from a German restaurant. Here are what I can recommend based on sequence:- start with light beer (lowenbrau tastes really good)- sequence into pork ribs - follow up with mashed potatoes, light buttery taste - finish off with smoked salmon pizzaWorth coming back.
1
It was one of the places open at 10PM and I'd lived in Austria for over a decade so I ended heading there for dinner. It was a horrible mistake. A plate of ribs + chocolate milkshake came to $50 and before I could even drink my milkshake, they had to take it away and replace it with another because apparently the cream had been sour. The ribs weren't anything special either and it was massively overpriced. Major, major disappointment. I suggest you avoid it at all costs.Service was great but that's the only good thing I have to say about it
4
Brotzeit is a fairly typical German restaurant/beer hall, with a wide variety of German beers and some excellent German food. The pork foot was great, and the sausages were like those you might find in Munich. Service was excellent, and we recommend Brotzeit to those needed a German infusion among the dozens, maybe hundreds, or alternative cuisines.
3
Went in after seeing Currywurst advertised, the bratwurst turned into a bockwurst and the curry sauce was ketchup with curry powder sprinkled on top, they couldn't even be bothered to mix it in. My wife tried to order a jaegerschnitzel as advertised, they had no idea what it was. The Lowenbrau beer was excellent and cold, we where seated upstairs and the airconditioning was positively arctic so we couldn't hang around too long

Brotzeit has another restaurant at Raffles City and it is fantastic. Expecting the same from the 313 Orchard Brotzeit we were very disappointed. It is like they are 2 completely different chains, not the same restaurant at all. And 313 Orchard was very expensive, $160 Aus for a 3 basic meals and a couple of beers. The beer is served in wet glasses with about 1/8 inch of water in the bottom of the glass. The staff wash the glass, don't dry it, then pour the beer in. When we explained beer should never to poured into glasses with water, the staff said the owner insisted on this as it is how they insured cleanliness. As expected the beer tasted atrocious. Also it was warm, not chilly as we Aussies like it. The sausages were thin, not well cooked and not the same as those served at the Raffles Brotzeit. We left most of our meals, the food was so bad we didn't want to eat it, and didn't finish the watery, hot beer. So $160 was a lot to pay for one of the worse meals we 3 have had in a very long time. Advice - forget Brotzeit 313 Orchard but do yourself a BIG favour and go to Brotzeit Raffles City. The beer is cold and the food is amazing
4
This place serves authentic German knuckles and sausages, and they have a good variety of German beer. We went there on a Monday night, and it was still busy. I heard that the place gets packed on weekends. The location is also perfect for a meal and drinks before or after you shop in Orchard Road
5
Just popped in to get out of the heat, and was attracted by the promise of a cool air conditioned room, which was great.The service was good, and a SUPERB menu of great snack style food and good range of drinks.We were served quickly and politely.Food range was great, a 9/10. The menu was also clear and the full colour quality pictures of just about everything really made it easy to ensure that we were ordering what what wanted.Pricing was OK, not cheap, but reasonable. I would give this an 8/10.. Cheap is always nice, but we were happy to pay for the quality / service / range / quantity.The volume of food was also good/ I would also give that 8/10Overall a very good experience and I would certainly recommend and return without hesitation
3
The food was quite good, as was the beer. Everything I would expect from this kind of place in Germany was available. Service was a little slow and lacklustre though, even by Singapore's standards.
5
Had a super meal in Brotzeit in both Orchard Road and then Bangsar Kuala Lumpur. Orchard Road meal was our last night in Singapore. Had the spicy lamb sausages. The sauerkraut is super by the way!
5
Seriously, so many sausages. If you're going with a group, get one if the large platters. Very tasty.
5
Great beers served in 500ml and 1liter! Priced ok. Near the city just across Sentosa where you have loads of activities as well.
5
While in Singapore we went to Brotzeit at 313@somerset and again at Westgate both were fantastic although the platter we got for 2 at Westgate and the Singapore sling I got was fantastic. The pork and the sausages were awesome.
4
Good selections of beers ; fairly traditional German food ; really efficient & friendly staff.
If you really want to eat German food in Singapore this is the place to go

We had dinner here last week because my parents had a craving for beer and sausages. It was not our first time at the restaurant, but it was the first time there after my dad's accident which left him dependent on wheelchair. We were hesitant to choose this venue at first due to the fact that we require more space for the wheelchair. However, to our pleasant surprise, the staff at Brotzeit were so helpful in reserving 2 tables (to be combined into 1) right near the entrance at the best location for my dad to access. We only had 5 people, but we had to take up 2 tables. It all worked out well thanks to the staff who reserved the table for us (sorry I forgot your name!). All of the staff we encountered that night were very prompt in service and friendly. We had a great dinner! Will definitely go back again!PS. They were having promotion for 4 types of beer at $10+ for 0.5l (yay!). Our orders: Pork knuckle (must try! Who wouldn't love crispy skin and tender meat?!), A platter of sausages (I can't remember the exact name, but it was a platter for 2. If you have more than 4 people, this will allow you to try different kinds of sausages. I liked the lamb and the spicy(pork/chicken) sausage), and Mozzarella salad.
4
The food was great, had the pork knuckle which was crispy outside and tender inside. The beer selection was promoted as premium but it was average at best. Paulaner isn't that great. Be prepared to pay excessive prices for your beer especially the specialties. There are better places to go if you want special German beers.
4
The Brotzeit is an authentic German restaurant. The food is very close to that you would find in Germany. I recommend you try the snitzel or the pork knuckle. There is a good selection of German beers. I always come to this restaurant during my frequent visits to Singapore. The prices are very reasonable
5
Been here for a company dinner and experienced friendly and good service. The food was very good and tasty ... quite close to the original taste. Beers are yummy, too. All in all a great spot if you bring a little extra budget as it is costly tho.
4
Great taste and very typical German dishes. A bit pricy but worth if you crave for it!
Currently under reconstruction until end of JAN16.
4
really can't complain, we had lovely beers, great food, good service and location was spot on, consistency across the range, recommended
3
Went there with my girlfriend. It is a great place to hang out for drinks but nothing to rave about the food. But service I have to say is friendly and warm. I would definitely go back as I have always been!
4
we had great beer with attentive service , great food and prok knuckle of course. Authentic German food sausages
4
Contemporary and cool setting, enjoyed their pork knuckle, colas and beers. A bit noisy because open space but always fun coming here. Staff are always friendly.

o Signature dish: pork knuckles is a MUST try! - Pork knuckles is a very big portion. Can be shared between a couple. 36SGD with knuckles, some salad and potato salad. o Nice pub environment. o Well decorated for Christmas atmosphere. i. I got Duck meat. Two well done duck thighs with cranberry gravy that compliments the softness of the well done meat. 30SGD a plate. o Beer!- German lagers! Real beer!For 0.3L, average 10+SGD; 0.5L, average 15+SGD. x Long queue if you do not have reservations. x Can not stay too long after you have checked out. Make sure to leave after you pay.

Ordered a pint and the beer was warm, not quite room temp bit close. Server took back and put in the fridge for 5 minutes. Glass came back cold, beer still warm. Bartender said it was served at 5-6 degrees. More like 15-20. Server basically said I was lying.
5
German beer and a German band filled out night in this restaurant. Service staff are friendly and accommodating. 4 of us were looking for some good beer and this made our night after long hours roaming around Singapore. We will definitely come back once we set foot in Singapore again. Great experience
5
The restaurant is serving authentic beer with varieties of selections. The mixed sausages is a must try with various type to suite the preference, some was spicy, mild and with cheeses. The seafood salad came with Salmon and fresh tuna not to mention that the green vegetable was fresh. Too bad we were not a big eater; but we can go back again for other dish in the menu. In spite of outdoor; but there enough breeze to cool you while drinking some alcohol
3
Been there with family, 6 ppl. Had a German beer and few typical dishes. It was all good but very fat, too fat. Rosti should not be "swimming" in oil...Service was OK but nothing further. Not offering advice or being very kind.Seats outside (no back) were not the most convenient I ever tried... ;-)Bottom line - great place if you are around and have craving for a Frankfurter and Beer.
5
Been a while when I had some good bread, with German beer and smoked ham. The girls been very friendly and provided a good service. Well done I will be back
4
Very pleasant lunch on Orchard Road with colleagues. Came here on my colleagues
recommendation and it was as he suggested very authentic. Great meal and definitely good quality.
Escape from the hustle and bustle of Orchard road and immerse yourself in a Bavarian feast.
5
Not being German, I can't really speak for the authenticity of the fare offered, but what we were served was pretty damned tasty.Our family of 3 adults and 3 children shared a lunch of seafood salad (meeresfrÃ¼chtsalat), oven roasted pork knuckle (schweinshaxn), grilled pork sausages (nÃ¼renberger), goulash (gulaschsuppe), spinach fladen (fladen spinat), and finished off with a dessert medley platter (nachspeisen teller) and several iced coffees (eiskaffees) which were essentially generous affogatos topped with whipped cream.We definitely left happy, and with bellies well-fueled for a full day out in Singapore
5
Regular at brotzeit with friends or family for great beer but the outing today was a pleasant shocker. We went for a quick meal with the family and given that I have a vip card with my birthday stored in it - I was offered a dessert platter which was absolutely awesome. Lovely of a good place to go that extra mile - I am certainly a loyalist now. Absolutely worth going again and again.
2
Had a dunkel lager in the afternoon and it was quite sour.Told the staff to check but he insisted he had been serving this all morning and no complaints. Disappointed by the lack of attention given on this matter.I'm a beer drinker and I know when something is wrong
5
Dined in Brotzeit at 313@Somerset last Friday and the food was totally superb!We ordered the platter [pork knuckle, pork ribs and assorted german sausages] and it's just perfect. Love the pork knuckle and the sausages so much.Satisfying my longing of Germany. As for the appetizer, we ordered the Brotzeit Brot, and it was totally awesome as well.Not to mention on the beer!It's just perfect, and love it so much
4
From many sorts of beer, including Radler, to typical German food â€“ you find it here. Their food has the unique taste from Germany and is mostly typical of that country too. Sitting here during a leisurely evening, it is fun watching the hundreds and hundreds of people walking by in deep conversations or laughing and teasing each other. It is worthwhile coming here for both the food and the watching of people â€“ eh of course for the beer too
3
Not that the food here, or any of its sister outlets, is bad, but everything about this place speaks "manufactured" and out to get the yuppie/tourist dollar. Service is patchy: staff may be hospitality school polite but you have to wait 20 mins for your food? How long does it take to grill a few sausages and cut some bread at 4.30pm in the afternoon? And like any other yuppie place, prices never really commensurate with the quality of the food.

I have never complained about a Restaurant or in a restaurant before but I had the most unbelievably worst experience ever at 313@summerset Singapore. I come to Brotzeit at least twice a week and the vivo city location is absolutely amazing. I also recommended it to many friends and promised my friend that this place is great. I usually order the Cabernet cheese and the dumpling salad. I requested the Cabernet cheese and since it was lunch they charged per piece saying that the kitchen does not make this cheese during lunch (although I have ordered many times before). I ended up getting only 4 pieces no cranberry sauce and paying the same as I would for the meal. I had to request several times for the sauce and by that time the food was cold. Soon after the couple next to us gets a salad with 5 pieces of Cabernet cheese on it. Clearly they make it during lunch. There is no manager at this location and no one seems to have the authority to make decisions and everyone was extremely rude. Also they practically threw the food in our plate. I attached the dumpling salad so you can see how it was served to me. I then proceeded to ask for water and no one would approach our table. They cleared my plate before I was half way done and would not listen when I asked to keep eating.This is so unbelievable for a restaurant that is a chain restaurant that should uphold it's name. This kind of service is completely ridiculous. I really hope that you will understand this concern and fix your operation. Thank you

Nice food with nice beer. There is this 0.48% alcohol which gives one the beer taste without the alcohol. Great invention. Nice service at this outlet too except all glass come out with a tiny layer of water. Remember to pour it away before your bottle beer is pour in or ....
