Quite authentic Korean cuisine with BBQ pork and beef, grill Mackerel fish, Jia Jang noodle, seafood pancake and steam egg.. do book before you come as the restaurant is small and will be packed with people. Expected a Long wait as the service is not too attentive . In general, a good value for Korean food, I enjoy it.

We were brought here by a Korean friend so it had to be pretty good. In fact, the place was probably 90% filled up by Koreans. The usual Korean appetisers were very good but it was the small cut beef BBQ that we would remember most. It really was the best among the many Korean restaurants we visited. Service was ok.

Me and a friend had made a reservation for dinner at 7:30 and on arrival were immediately seated at a lovely table for bbq and extra side table (lots of food to come!). The restaurant was moderately busy with just over half the tables filled, with many of the other tables having been reserved as well.The wait staff was quick to bring us the menus (though my friend who had been before was pretty much ready to order the good stuff!). We got the BBQ set of beef cubes, pork belly and pork collar as this was the main attraction of the night for us. The set came with a side order of which we chose kimchi soup (other small pots of soup or stew available too). Free and refillable banchan as a good and proper korean restaurant should have, and just because she raved about it, the seafood pancake (which when we saw the neighbours, realised Wow it's quite a big on the table haha). Oh and of course of Hite beer (first time trying but a new fave!!! Light and refreshing for our bbq food).The banchang came quickly as did the drinks (sadly no barley tea served).The meats came next and were immediately placed on the stove to cook. Onions, potato and mushrooms placed on there as well (to later sit the cooked meat).We chowed on the banchang, heating up the kimchi on the stove as well (little trick taught to my friend by a chef in korea). The exhaust pipe worked a dream and barely smelt the cooking fumes from the bbq-ing meat mmmmm...The beef cooked first and we immediately bundled the cubes of perfectly medium-cooked pieces into fresh cabbage with the sauce provided, some kimchi (garlic and green chili also provided - later to experiment with). The beef was amazingly tender and tasty - on point!!The kimchi tofu stew arrived before the pork was truly ready so had some lovely warm soup and tofu in between.When the pork was ready, the waitress came to help us cut it up and place the cooked meat on the side of the stove (mostly on the onions, mushroom and potato - only ate the mushrooms though). Some meat was left stranded nearer the centre of the hot stove and unfortunately ended up burning (so we didn't eat all the lovely pork!). Having said that, the pork belly was delectable and the pork collar even sweeter and more tender!! Very hard to decide whether the beef or the pork collar was better to be honest...Lastly came the seafood pancake (just as we were getting rather full on all the meat and kimchi soup!!!) But no worries, the staff were fine to let us sit and digest for a bit and very slowly savour the pancake. The first bite was so fresh crispy with plenty of prawn and squid (and green onion) packed in. Sad to say our stomachs did leave behind a couple pieces of the omelette (dug out all the seafood though). I feel the cabbage in the kimchi soup was another big winner - plenty of flavour! And the soup stayed warm for well over 2 hours! Amazing.Delicious experience here, halfway through the meal the restaurant did get a bit busy though so getting some banchan refills took a while but that was pretty much the ONLY negative thing that night - the posiive aspects Surely outshone everything else. Want to be back to eat more (possibly the same bbq meats!) But other stews too =D*sorry no photos - too eager to eat after the food was ready
