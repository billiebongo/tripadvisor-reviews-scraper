Good food with excellent service. Just that waiting time slightly longer. Overall dining experience is still ok.

Vibes and ambience is chic and fantastic. Staffs went extra miles for their services and you basically feel very relaxed basking in this kind of environment for a pleasant dinner.

Great atmosphere, fantastic friendly service and tremendous food. Strongly recommend this restaurant.

Octopus was the star of the night. Most other items were good but nothing extremely fantastic. Overall a very pleasant experience especially for big groups.

The food portion is abit too small for the price but the taste is there! Very good flavours, love the mussels and clams pot. Excellent and attentive service makes a great dining experience!

beautiful location but food is below average for the cost ... Live music is very loud for lunch time and service very amateur

Nice place to hang out with friends or have intimate dinner. The ambiance is relaxing. The food is also good and the selection of wine is quite a lot. Love the banoffee desert the most!
3
Had the fish and chips starter. The shoestring fries didn’t really work. I would have preferred regular fries. The calamari was just alright though I’ve had better.

Great location, very good for outdoor seating. Family friendly, they have several play zones for kids.Seafood wasnâ€™t bad, but did not impress. Lobster is served without the shell cracker or a bib (!). For share dishes are RIDICULOUSLY overpriced for the teeny portions you get. Funny enough, the best dish we had was the steak, the only meat option in the restaurant

If you love the out of Singapore experience without travelling, this is a good place to check out. Overall the food did not disappoint. My friends liked their coffee and food choices. For me, it was more misses than hits as mine was vegetarian choices. Overall, we had a lovely time

very attentive service by Khalid. the seafood is awesome, and the ambiance is nice and relaxing for a casual romantic night out.

Ambience was fantastic. Casual and cosy; perfect for gathering of friends. Food was good but portion could perhaps be more generous.

We had dinner here for the first time and were duly impressed.
Seafood pasta was yummy, tho we did feedback the lobster wasn’t so fresh.
Grilled octopus was superb. Service was impeccable.

Prices are abit high for the quality of food. Food is of average taste only. Variety is also quite limited.

Lunch to celebrate wifes birthday. Very good quality food. Great service, and nice ambience. The views over Keppel bay are fabulous.
We ordered, roast chicken to share, fish and chips. The water was filtered and $1 for unlimited refils including sparkling.

Food was excellent. Service was great. Very knowledgeable staff, great recommendations. Love the squid salad, and the seafood platter. Cooked to perfection. Desserts are pretty awesome too. A bit pricey but what's not that is by the ocean?

Our experience was made very enjoyable especially by Matthew and Fay!
Matthew could recognized that I am a return guest and he always offer his warm smile and service to me and my family which made the dining very enjoyable. Thank u!

Four of us with different dishes. Everyone of them tasty. Sat inside but open plan so we could enjoy the view of the boats . Service attentive. We are older so we had 2 starters each rather than main meal. The menu sizes can be adapted from group share , main meal to small starter plates . Happy hour added the cherry on top of a delightful meal. Very high standard of cooking.

We visited here during some of the worst weather Singapore had seen in 5 years but the welcome was warm. The restaurant over looks the harbour with a delightful al fresco area , weather permitting of course. The service was very attentive and nothing was left standing around on our table. The food was exceptional , we treated ourselves to a selection of snacks/starters followed by one of the chefs signature dishes. The tuna tartare melted in your mouth and as for the bone marrow starter absolutely delightful. The quality and presentation of the food really showed some experience, and you can watch the guys at work as the kitchen is open for all the guests to see the food being prepared.What a lovely retardant and I will definite recommend to all my friends who will be visiting Singapore

Enjoyed a great evening with the Girlfriend on New Yearâ€™s Eve at the Restaurant.The al fresco atmosphere was great with a nice view of the Bay and the food was delicious.What stood out for me was the service with different waiters being very friendly and hospitable throughout and ensuring that our food was served promptly and water always refilled.Will definitely revisit again

Very fresh seafood. We had the fisherman's feast and special of the day lobster risotto which were both delicious. Excellent service from Khalid and Fay. Only minor gripe was that the wine list was pricey. But choice of Gabriel glasses as stemware is excellent.
5
We came here despite the heavy rain. They had lights strung around so it was pretty and pleasant. Very nice to bring out of town tourist. Service was excellent- she aimed to please. Seafood was good. Would come again

We were there for birthday dinner. Good service, good quality seafood, great dessert at relax and breezy ambient. What more to ask for :)
5
Service staff especially Ms Fay was very good. She helped to photographs for us. When she learned that my husband & I were celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary, she surprised with us with sparkler & dessert. Present to us a photo of us with signatures from all the staff in Bayswater Kitchen. Quality of food was good.Ambience was good

Bayswater Kitchen is the reincarnation of Prive Grill. What is absolutely delightful is that the entire service crew from the old Prive Grill is still there, and is as professional as ever! The service, as can be expected, is top notch - with veterans Cindy, Faye, Bob, Li Jiao, Liana, holding the fort. And the entire dining experience is made extra special because of the fantastic team.The concept now, as compared to Prive Grill, is a lot more casual. It's seafood dining by the marina, and the menu features primarily seafood. It's a fairly small menu, but the ingredients are fresh, and the food diligently prepared by the chef and his team. The chef is extremely friendly - a young man from London, and one can tell that he takes food very seriously. The deco is slightly cheesy, but the overall ambience can be said to be acceptable for the concept. We will go back again, for sure

The food was great, well seasoned and nicely presented. The cauliflower side dish is a must order there. Service provided by the FOH team was just great, especially by Lyiana. After hearing that it was my birthday the day before we dined here, she went all the way to serve us a complimentary dessert with Happy Birthday writing on it and a card with a polaroid photo of my family. Note that she only knew of it when we were finishing our meal and then prepared all these in a short span of time, as someone who works in the F&B industry, the service here is just really good, I look forward to visiting here again

A good getaway from the chaos of Vivo City and Harbour Front, Bayswater Kitchen serves up delectable seafood amidst a backdrop of yachts and the marina. The backdrop is beautifully complemented by delectable fresh seafood. The seafood platter is definitely worth it and the seaweed fries ala McDonald's has more flavour than the Golden Arches.Service is pretty good and the wait staff are accommodating and helpful. Definitely worth a trip for some peace and good food

We have eaten here three times now! The food is always great and the ingredients are fresh. We were here for an engagement party last week and the restaurant were very helpful in putting together a menu for 15 people....Was a great celebration in the private room and very affordable. This restaurant has been added to our regular list of places to eat. The food is fantastic paired with a relaxing ambiance overlooking the marina. Great job guys

The Fishermen's Feast was an extremely flavourful pasta dish and perfect for a breezy night. It was a good size for us, but might be too small a portion for big eaters. On top of several glasses of very good Prosecco (at happy hour prices!), we also got a chargrilled octopus starter and two desserts to round off the night. The only downside was that both desserts were banana-based, which was a bit much after a while; we wish the server had advised us against making that selection. In general, the attentive and enthusiastic service made an already good night even better. We will definitely return to try other dishes on the menu!

Within minutes of drive from the CBD area, one can be transported to a lovely island within the island to enjoy fresh seafood cuisine. The menu is updated daily, serving the freshest produce from the sea and creations of the talented chef. It's extremely kids friendly. The openness of the place, with great view, fresh air and most importantly, good honest food. We all yearn for a hearty good meal with our loved ones and this new place is certainly a good addition to our sunny island

Great seafood restaurant with wonderful service and lovely atmosphere. Really enjoyed the seafood platter.

Visited this place for the first time for my wife's birthday dinner. The staff were very attentive and friendly. The food, although is in small portions, tasted good.
3
Ordered the fisherman platters, the ingredients are fresh. It is a pity that the cooking is too salty.

Stunning view and ambience of the marina. We had the 3 course set lunch. The fresh oysters were fresh. The beef agnolotti was tasty and satisfying. But the cod roe was fishy and the fish main course was unimpressive.
5
We were informed subsequent to the Chope reservations of the outdoors sitting as the indoors area was booked for a private function. It was a good gesture as some may not like al fresco dining in the humid weather. Unfortunately it was high tables/chairs for outdoors and this was unsuitable for the elderly folks in the group. The staff were quick to offer a solution. They basically shifted a normal table out for us.We tried both the seafood platters. The food was excellent! Staff were attentive and quick to explain on some quirks like the need to pay for iced water. Overall we had an enjoyable time and we’ll visit the place again.

Second visit and the food let it down. Really good service here. Very friendly serving staff. Unfortunately we had the $76 fishermen’s feast and the lobster was raw. We sent it back and they reheated it. The mussels were tiny and poor quality. Didn’t eat it. Ordered the bannoffe desert because still hungry. This was ice cream and banana. Manager said it was ‘deconstructed’. The white wine we got from New Zealand was poor quality. Manager said she will have to speak to the supplier. She took the main off the bill, which was good because we didn’t eat it. But not a good experience to be honest. Hope they can improve. Not good value for money.

This is the best location in Singapore to escape the busy city life! We went with a group of friends on a Saturday evening to enjoy the breezy waterfront location - great views as it overlooks the marina. The menu is seafood oriented but has a great variety so sufficient options for everyone. We tried the octopus and Japanese mackerel to share as starters, which were very fresh and tasteful. Thereafter we ordered the fisherman's feast and it was absolutely delicious! We even got to bring home the lobster shell with a recipe to make our own lobster broth, which we enjoyed the day after. Will definitely be back

I always feel like I'm on holiday the moment I step in Bayswater Kitchen. Friendly staff and great seafood menu. I've been here for lunch and dinner and completely loved it. I'd recommend the Fisherman's feast, Pimms lemonade and for meat lovers - they're steak is delicious

I enjoyed dinner here a lot! The atmosphere was wonderful and the staff are very kind and friendly. I ordered a seafood platters for two pax. Most of food are very delicious, above the average, except oyster. Only two oysters are served in the platter but the size of oysters are too small. Maybe next time I hope better oysters will be served

They didn’t have enough oysters for us we are given 1 dozen to share. I wasn’t expecting that from a seafood restaurant. Was disappointed to have picked this restaurant to celebrate a birthday event. Food was ok not fantastic, portion too small for the high price.
