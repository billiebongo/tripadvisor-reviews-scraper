This restaurant is on the 2nd floor of the Rochester mall.
I enjoyed my meal and the ingredients was fresh with good service
I was not convinced on the fusion part besides that it was a delicious meal

Don't worry about the fusion allusion, I think this place delivers good basics, such as sashimi and tempura, The sake list is brief, well priced and I found that it offered a pleasant way of getting to know the various grades of this drink.

Great Japanese food, I especially love their Salmon Don as their salmon is very fresh. Many times I will pre-order over phone and pick up my healthy and high quality dinner. Can highly recommend this place.

My wife and I had lunch there once last Spring. We were attracted by the concept of fusion sushi. Although the food was OK, we could not find out any aspect of fusion in itâ€¦A little overprice.
