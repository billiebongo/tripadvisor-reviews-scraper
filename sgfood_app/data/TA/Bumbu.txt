Great food. We had the Beef Rendang - soft and tender, sambas Kang kong, most of the fish dishes! All delicious and looked after by a lovely team.
3
Food is quite good but portion is small and price is quite high. it is a famous Indonesian restaurant and quite crowded when we were there. The interior environment is good which make me feel quite comfortable.
3
Went there for dinner with friends. Ambience good and cosy. Food average. Price reasonable. Very convenient walking distance from Bugis mrt. Nearby vicinity very alive in the night. Many tourist hanging around other food areas.
5
Visited a couple of times. Food consistently good. Tahu Telor, beef rendang, steam fish in lime sauce, sambas Kang Kong, stuffed chicken wing, durian with glutinous rice, chendol - all turned out well. Do make reservations for the 2nd floor.
5
The food was tasty and the service was pleasant and efficient. The tables are not close to each other so you can have some privacy, which is unusual in Singapore. We had the lemongrass fish and the beef rendang, and some vegetables, and it was a great meal. One thing to improve would be to offer freshly squeezed drinks, e.g. lime juice etc, then it would be perfect
4
Love the deco of the place. Designed to match any peranakan museum with high chandeliers mirrors and paintings. The food is above average. My favourites include tahu teloh (fried bean curd and egg) and beef rendang. Can miss the desserts though as there are plenty of cafe nearby.
4
This restaurant offers some unique dishes inspired by Indonesian and Thai foods. The restaurant is small, but has two stories, with peranakan-style interior design. The ambience is nice and the service is quick. The food is good and the prices are typical for the restaurants in the area. It misses five star in my book due to inappropriate serving of some dishes. For example, "buah keluak chicken" is served with not much chicken in it. Essentially though, we could just enjoy the sauce, but not the chicken with the sauce
4
Have patronised Bumbu for many years, since the days they had buffet. The fold quality has never wavered. You will get good quality food at affordable prices for about $20 per pax. The decor is old school and you become transported to an old part of Singapore. Truly authentic.

Away from the busy part of Kampong Glam, lies the townhouse setting of Bumbu. Our first sight was a rather uninspiring (visually) menu. However once inside the setting was excellent. Took Tahu Telor, pandan chicken and a few other dishes. A 4 out of 5 on taste and presentation but a 5 out of 5 for service, setting and atmosphere. If looks busy if you look in, there is also an even better looking 2nd floor
5
It's often hard to go past the classic Asian dishes. Since arriving in Singapore, I have been looking forward to a plate of Beef Redang.At Bumbu I enjoyed a brilliant version of the dish: beef shin cooked for six hours to a special recipe resulting in melt in the mouth meat cooked in a sauce of complex tastes. Perhaps a touch more chilli for our aspestos tastes, but hey it was outstanding. I'm generally not a fan of tofu, but the Taha Telor dish was excellent and well worth ordering. For drinks, my wife enjoyed lime juice while I quaffed the fresh young milk of a coconut.The venue is fascinating with many beautiful traditional prints, tiles, signs, screens and crockery. Service was swift and the owner was both friendly and informative.A real find
4
Very nice old house with tables in two floors. Beautiful indonesian and thai dishes, and some interesting drink selections (no alcohol).
3
Ordered the Olive Fried Rice and Fried Mee Sua. Mee Sua was too oily and and Fried Rice was too salty for our taste. Prawns was treated with bicarbonate and seaweed has a strong sea taste. Not a good sign for a restaurant.
5
Bumbu is the place for a wonderful family dinner! The food was delicious and ambience was adequate. Friendly waiters and waitresses made the dining experience much more satisfying. Pls visit Bumbu for all your family dining needs!
4
One of the pioneer restaurants in the area.
Good atmosphere. Good food. Great value. Great mix of dissent Asian flavors and favorites.
2
The restaurant in quite nice but the food is basic, far from the level we were expecting . We left the restaurant with only one idea in mind, find a place to drink a coffee and change the taste in our mouths!
4
Awesome restaurant and food. My PA was leaving, so organised a team lunch here for her farewell. I pre-ordered the food in advance and we were 20 paxs. Food was amazing, price was reasonable and close by in Telok Ayer Street. Totally recommend this place!
4
We were taken here by our guide on a Round the Island Tour of Singapore organised by Tour East. There were 11 in our group.The staff were friendly and the service efficient.. We were given a very good selection of tasty dishes including peppered beef, chicken wings cashew nuts, a fish tikka, and a number of vegetable dishes.The food was hot...Very hot in one of the capsicum spiced vegetables. The meal was not rushed,but, nevertheless, was completed in one hour. A very good choice by our guide
5
I discovered this place 15 years ago right after it opened and I got to meet the owners and hear about the ideas and concept of the place and it has only gotten better over the years. I always try to have at least lunch here each trip and while I rarely come for dinner it is even better than lunch. It is in an old historic shop house and is cool but also romantic in the best way. Food is the drawing point the place itself is beautiful inside. Singapore has every kind of ethnic restaurant but this place offers something unique and different and that is what sets it apart, Highest marks for the owners and what they have built over the years this place is awesom
4
Besides the restaurant at Kandahar Street, Bumbu has another outlet at 125 Telok Ayer Street. Serving Indonesian Thai fusion food, this Telok Ayer outlet, a conserved shophouse has a seating capacity for 50 persons. We had a tok panjang (long table) for 12 persons. The coffee flavoured chicken was good. So was the tahu Telok, spicy sambal kangkong and tomyam soup. The bumbu salad (weird contortion of century eggs and prawns) and stir fry cuttlefish in black sauce were disappointing. Ambience was pretty noisy but staff were friendly and prices reasonable. Worth a try
4
The restaurant is located in an old shop house. Most of the seats are at the second storey. The place has lots of historical furnishings and the neighbourhood it is located in makes the whole meal experience unique and different. The dishes are excellent, the beef especially soft. Deserts however is a contrast and I would give them a miss if I return here
5
Just had a wonderful dining experience in the gorgeous Arab quarter. This restaurant has a great feel, welcoming staff and food that truly has us wanting to go back and try more.
4
Serving a mix of local, Nonya, Indonesian and Thai cuisine in a house museum-like setting filled with Peranakan furniture and antiques, this restaurant in the historic Kampong Glam district is a lovely place to host foreign guests.
5
This eatery is well decorated with antiques of yesteryear, including old posters for population control.
Its is difficult to locate delicate nonya cooking and this one is highly recommended. Each dish is well-thought out and the ingredients are prepared from scratch. Bon appetite
4
Despite small and located few minutes walk away from MRT (best to use Taxi, Grab Car or Uber), this is place is very unique and interesting. It has great peranakan decorative and collectibles that the owner collected.The menu is a bit limited. They offered Indonesian-Thai cuisines but I think they could have added local Chinese and Malay cuisines as well that goes along well with the theme. Slightly pricey for Kg. Glam/Arab street standard. Regardless, the foods are delicious and still worthy. I think the beef rendang (my favourite cuisine) needs more improvement though.I love that they played classic Malay songs such as Gerimis Mengundang and some Saloma's songs. Really nostalgic
3
This eatery has antique Peranakan-style furniture. It's menu consists of Indonesian Thai food.we had butter oat soft shell crab, fried fish with in house Chilli, coffee flavoured chicken, salted egg yolk prawn, stir fried seasonal vegetables, thou telor, fish maw soup, crispy Kang Kong salad, Ngho Hiang, Tom yum soup, green curry chicken, fried Mee Sua, Thai tea and ice blended avocado. I noticed that they also have set menu for 2-10 people
4
In Kampong Glam, it's easy to get overwhelmed with all of the food choices. Bumbu restaurant was a gem for sure. I ordered green curry chicken and my wife ordered chili basil chicken. Both were very delicious and arrived quickly! Prices were fair for Singapore and when considering the quality of the food, it was very worth it. Enjoy
5
This restaurant, serving Thai, Indonesian and Peranakan dishes; is located in a pre-war shophouse. It sits in front of an open space with swings and is not difficult to locate. Walking into the restaurant, you are at once taken in by the beautifully well-preserved and ornate furnishings. Its interiors take on a home setting, except that numerous tables and chairs allow patrons to dine comfortably. Tables and chairs are also available upstairs and one can admire the furniture and fixtures as you dine.The menu serves up typically dishes such as pomelo salad, sambal kangkong, prawn cake, etc. The chicken laced with coffee flavours takes a while to get used to when first served with its aroma filling the air. Once the scent settles down, the dish is surprisingly tasty. Steam rice is also replenished generously.The choice of piped-in music was a little strange at first as songs sung by The Bee Gees was heard but later on, it was switched to something more in line with the restaurant's cuisine and so it blended in quite nicely for an overall satisfying dining experience
5
This Peranakan themed restaurant wins customers' hearts through the display of ancient decoration. It's like eating at a Peranakan museum. I have been here a couple of times but think it's about time that I gave the review they truly deserve. Amongst my favourites, cashew nut chicken (must have!), assam prawn, fried baby squid and for dessert, durian sticky rice!
5
Always busy, but the owner was very kind and offer us to be called for the time a table was set free. The food was various and very good, they serve traditional recipes but with gorgeous results. Even the desserts were great and not ordinary. Price more than fair. Recommende
5
After a long day my husband and I walked to Bambu around 8:45 pm and the place was busy. The decor is Peranakan and very beautifully decorated. We decided to order things we do not normally see back in San Francisco. We ordered the olive fried rice, coffee chicken, mango salad and tauhu telor (a tofu deep fried egg dish). The flavors in each dish were absolutely amazing. We noticed at that late time most of the customers were locals. We would return and recommend. This was easily two meals for two people so we walked off with lunch for the next day too
3
Yes it was interesting.
Clean and well presented restaurant.
We ordered dishes we have not had before and did not really enjoy it.
It was reasonably priced worth another visit.
5
This restaurant is owned by a collector of Peranakan antiques. One sits amongst these beautiful artifacts while one eats Ayam Buah Keluak, crispy kangkong salad, ngoh hiang, coffee chicken, whole fish, cereal soft shell crab, etc etc
4
This is a lovely place and the food was very good. The restaurant is furnished in Peranakan style and is a good follow up after a visit to the Peranakan Museum. Their ice chendol was delicious and much higher quality than what I got in other places.We had the pandan chicken, beef rendang, long beans and olive fried rice. All was very tasty
5
The venue was unbelievable, surrounded by water and escorted to your table. Staff where amazing, friendly and well trained. Food to die for, I had the crispy soft shell crab and then the braised lamb curry with dates, deserts where also great. My wife had the duck for a main and it was as good as my dish - actually we swapped half way through each dish. One of the next meals we have had in Bali
5
We had a great meal of our favourite Indonesian dishes. Beef rendang and gado gado. The service was efficient and meals very tasty. The food was not overly expensive and all in all we could not fault this dinning experience.Also the restaurant was full of locals and families and their kids - so always a good sign
4
This Indonesian-Thai restaurant is beautifully decorated with Peranakan artifacts, colourful wall tiles, and Peranakan photographs, giving the small restaurant a feeling of walking back into the 60s. (Peranakan - these are descendants of Chinese immigrants who came to the Malay archipelago prior to British Malaya and also during British Malaya, and then married locally and created a blend of Chinese-Malay culture.) If you are a tourist and want to experience a blast from the past, this restaurant is a must-see.The food too is authentic and exquisite. My wife and I popped in for lunch and we ordered the fish maw soup, pomelo salad, fried assam prawns, sambal kangkong, and steamed rice. The fish maw (air bladder) soup had a rich, smooth texture, and not salty and had a good helping of crab meat too. The pomelo salad had freshly cut chilli that blended well with the sweetness of the pomelo. If you are ordering a number of dishes, I suggest you share a bowl of soup, and the salad. The prawns used in the fried assam (tamarind) prawn dish were fresh and tasty - a must try. The sambal kangkong (Chinese cabbage cooked in prawn paste) was a slight disappointment because it did not have enough cut chilli to give it the hotness that is normally expected in such a dish. But nevertheless, a tasty dish.The service is excellent and food is served really fast. If you are in Kampung Glam and you are looking for a place to visit, do stop by the Bambu Restaurant
3
You felt like you was dining in some ones front room furnished with antique ornate surroundings with a lovely wall clock. I enjoyed the sweet & sour chicken and the olive fried rice. The prawn cakes were tasty too. The wife had the mango salad which she found too hot for her taste buds. She found the tofu dish a bit too greasy for her liking.If you like private dining then this is the place for you
4
I was visiting Kampung Glam and shopping for some Arabic perfume oil. By 11-ish I got a bit hungry and went looking for food. Plenty of choices around but I wanted a nice and different place. Then I was on Kandahar street and there I saw BUMBU. The interior decor is definitely very exotic and screams "Nonya"! Though the manager proclaims it's Indonesian Thai. After looking at their extensive menu, which was priced in the middle. I decided on "Ayam Buah Keluak", actually a Nonya Baba dish but they have it, and was very delicious. A bit big for one person but I managed to finish it with enough rice. An icy cold Air Bandung completed this meal perfectly. All the time, I got good service, was all by myself since it was before 12, eating in such a lovely place all by myself was a treat
4
You will feel like you are in a family home as soon as you walk into Bumbu. Beautiful and ornate antique Peranakan furniture, tiles, tiffin carriers etc adorned the restaurant. It was like a privilege being in Bumbu.The food was good and affordable, like home cooking. I enjoyed the chicken bush keluak and bean sprouts with salted fish. The portions were small....but just right.Service was attentive and friendly. Definitely worth a visit again
5
My friend took me to this restaurant for dinner and wow! this is an amazing place, the decor is old and antique with Peranakan pieces from history and its a hidden gem along the row of several restaurants and bars. At first we were apprehensive if we will get vegetarian food, but we were assured of a lot of choices to select from. We ordered several dishes and the Green Curry with Tofu and Olive Fried rice were the best of the lot.. Thoroughly enjoyed the food and the ambience. A must if you are visiting Singapore
5
Excellent address for a quick tasty indonesian meal. Their speciality (forgot the name) is absolutely delicious. Very friendly service. Good for family and for a quick dinner between loved ones !
4
It is a humble location but a hidden gem
Excellent food, service and courtesy
Chili and pepper crabs are superb
Century eggs
Fermented prawn rice
All delicious
Just to sit down and enjoy
4
The place is rather small so make reservations or arrive early to avoid disappointment. The food is tasty and is definitely worth a visit.
5
Went for lunch with a group from work. We had a variety of plates. All were wonderful. I'm vegetarian and it was no problem. A highlight for me was the surreal bathroom upstairs. Check it out and you'll see what I mean 😉
5
The food tasted great to us (having no experience of Malay food). The decor is very interesting and the staff friendly. Great that it has air conditioning. More space upstairs.
3
The food is sumptuous, comes in small portion, and prices can be better. Services are not a wow but considered a pass. Location is ideal for office crowd but seating is limited.
5
We went here about an hour to closing time with a 2 year old, but their serves and friendliness was as high as it could be any time of the day. They were very accommodating and friendly and the kiddo loved the retro deco. The food was pretty good and worth the price. A Tom-Yum (for 2) beef rendang, rice, a stir-fried veggie, steamed rice and lime juice for two cost us about 46SGD. Located in a more Malayan/Indonesian area of the city it is a nice part of town. They were even kind enough to call us a taxi after our meal. All in all an A
4
Casual setting in a quaint shophouse. Warm attentive service. More importantly, savoury dishes, among which Rendang and Thai Chicken with Holy Basil stands out. The CHendol drink provides a calming counterpoint to the spice. And good value for money.Reservations are recommended as the place gets full, and there aren't too many air-conditioned restaurants in the Kampong Glam area
4
Was there 2 weeks ago. Love the ambiance & deco of the place - very homely. The owner is friendly and made good recommendations. Good food not too peranakan, a good fusion with Thai. I highly recommend this restaurant to tourists - enjoy good food and some Peranakan culture & deco. Of course for the local as well. ENJOY
3
When you walk inside this place the decor really strikes you.It is eclectic and charming.Friendly service and ok food but very heavy on the chilli.Sadly they do not serve alcohol when a cold beer would really help!the mango salad was the best dish and the chicken chilli with basil was the most disappointing as it was overwhelmed by one kind of bottled sauce
4
Delicious food and interesting menu, a fusion of Indonesian and Peranakan foo. Recommended to come with big group because food portion is pretty big. Tahu Telor (fried tofu with egg) is one of recommended items.
5
I visited here with 4 friends and we had a fantastic time. Really good atmosphere, attentive service.The menu is extensive and has some really creative dishes. We ordered a huge selection and we all really enjoyed our food. The green curry had a delicious flavour and tasted better than any I'd had before.The toilet is also hilarious and has a goldfish bowl in there! You must visit it.Overall, a fantastic restaurant doing great business. Will return for sure
5
I always like to eat peranakan food and this authentic restaurant made it even better.The restaurant is well decorated with deco, plates and bowls of peranakan culture. Even the tiles are of peranakan designs.The food is awesome and it is very suitable for group gathering and bonding
4
I think it's hard to go wrong with spicy food, and in comparison with some other places, I would rather rate it 'good', being above average. Anyway I brought some overseas visitors who are somewhat chili-challenged and need a halal menu. Our choices were tauhu telor, pandan chicken, mango salad fried fish, chicken hei cho (prawn rolls) and a vege dish. The guests liked the food and expressed surprise at the absence of a burning sensation, but I think it was more the judicious choices of my missus!Topped off with avocado shake, it was a nice meal and walking around the area in the cool evening showed how much this area has become more touristy, albeit in a nice way. The restaurant has some interesting historical artifacts within and provides a nice historical touch
4
This still remains one of the best paranakan restaurants (though they call it Indonesian-Thai food, they do have some peranakan dishes too) in town, and one that I take visitors to, as an intro. The food and decor remain as good as ever. Tried the black pepper beef this time, as well as the olive fried rice. Both were very spicy, though the right amount of spicy. The tahu telor was good, if not memorable. The buah keluah chicken remains one of the highlights
5
Lovely small restaurant in the Arab quarter of Singapore, a very lively area. The meal for 6 was varied, spicy and very well presented. Highlights were the sambal brinjal, steamed fish in spicy lime sauce, green mango with soft shell crab and the rending, although everything was excellent. A good atmosphere upstairs
5
I a not a specialist in halal food but I must say that the food is amazing. We tried great variety of(around 15)dishes and just 2-3 were too spicy for me (I don't eat very spicy). There was something for everybody - vegan, fish, seafood and meat. I did not like the soup as well but Asian soups are quite different anyway, with less spices and they are tasteless to me
4
Bumbu presents a wide variety of dishes, some malay, some thai, and all with a slightly Singaporean angle to them. Flavours are good, but the spice needs to be turned up somewhat. Beef Rendang was succulent and tasty, with strong coconut and tamarind flavours, but the sauce was a touch thin and lacked a real Rendang chilli kick.Thai-style kangkong were similarly tasty, but also lacked that spciy piquancy that marks a real Thai dish. Mango salad also had plenty of flavour but lacked spice. Three dishes with the same shortcoming tells me an awful lot about this place. Good, but not great. The ambience is very relaxed and the decor is also very pleasant. Peranakan screens separate tables, giving an almost private room feel to your "booth", which adds to the romantic feel of the venue.Bumbu have been around for a long time, so it could just be my tastebuds, but if you are looking for spice, then there are better options close-by in Kandahar Street
4
The food was fabulous, service was great, the decor is beautiful and we pretty much liked everything, except for the lack of atmosphere :-(Very quiet restaurant and very reserved (maybe the lack of alcohol as it's a muslim Indonesian place!), but definitely a recommend for the food... :-
1
Please do not try the rendang. If you know how a real rendang taste like then do not even try the rendang here. This is a warning.If you do not know how a rendang taste like and somehow you have tasted bumbu's rendang that is not how a rendang should taste. And most of their other dishes are tasteless. On a good note the service is ok
3
...Was way too high. We had a soup and two main courses. Proper indonesian food but delivered to the table within 5 minutes. Fresh? The dishes were nice though.
5
great spot around the corner from Arab Street. Found it by mistake but went back repeated times.
Food was single, local , cheap and fast.
Was made to feel welcome..
will go back
3
The decor is all Asian antiques and the food is a mix of Thai and Indonesian. This is a pleasant restaurant to be introduced to Asian cuisine.
5
Been here last week.Always love their Fried Fish in the house chilli.The sauce is marvelous.Remember to ask for extra for this marvellous sauce.This dish taste great with just a plain rice.Their other dishes that satisfy us are the fish maw soup,pandan chicken and specially made garlic kai lan.Besides,we too enjoy their peranakan furniture.A bit loud some might say,but we love to see when tourist seems mesmerised by such showcasing of perakan furniture and the old antiques that I could personally relate to when I were younger.Will always like to come back here again for more halal Thai- Indonesia mixed cuisine
5
It's located in a row of restaurants. When you walk in you'll find old Chines/Singaporean furniture and decorations.Another good sign was that we were the only non-locals in the place.We ordered coffee chicken, green curry and banana leaf chicken. All very good. I had my doubts with the coffee chicken but it just had right amount coffee flavor
1
My family and I have been to Bumbu a few times in the past. The food was good and that was the reason why I wanted to frequent Bumbu again. Unfortunately, after making reservation one month in advance, they called me a couple of days before the event, informing me that they only have a small table and asked how old my kids are. They were trying to squeeze us into a small setting. Anyway, after the Bumbu person said he'll check, I called them back in 10mins to inquire if there's any problem with the table, etc. And guess what. A Chinese man, probably the one who always situated himself at the counter, picked up my call and started shouting at me. He was so rude. Never had I encounter such rude attitude from a restaurant manager/owner before. I actually told him that he was very rude and it is not acceptable to behave like that to anyone, let alone your customer.Needless to say, I cancelled my reservation for another better restaurant. Despite the good food, I will not patronise this restaurant again. There are so many halal restaurants in Singapore. I do not want to part with my money (regardless how small) to restaurants like this who are just so plain arrogant
4
We ended up in this restaurant because the one we wanted to go to had a long queue and it was already late in the evening. The restaurant is a converted shophouse with 2 dining areas: a few large tables downstairs, and some more tables upstairs in a room with high ceilings. We had the last available table in the upstairs room.The whole restaurant is decorated with Peranakan antiques and has an eclectic charm. I find the upstairs area prettier than downstairs, but both rooms provide very pleasant seating.Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and service was quick.We had the cashew chicken, seasonal stir fried vegetables and a red curry with a couple of juices. All our food was extremely nice. All in (the bill is ++), we paid just over SGD 40 for a delicious meal. I will definitely go back to try some of the other dishes

On friday 25 July I went to lunch for the first time with 4 other friends to Bumbu Restaurant located at 44 Kandahar Street. Having first read the reviews on Tripadvisor for this restaurant , some being full of praise, I came away disappointed.This establishment does not specialize in a particular cuisine but is a hodgepodge of Thai, Indonesian and *Peranakan dishes. * ( Peranakan cuisine is a unique blending of Chinese ingredients with different distinct spices and cooking techniques used by the Malay/ Indonesian community, brought about by the inter-marriage of the early migrant Chinese with the locals of South East Asia)We ordered a selection of 8 dishes from the menu, a mixture of Thai, Indonesian and Malay. The toughest challenge for any Restaurant is to uphold consistency and quality of food for their patrons. Having to juggle 3 different cuisines is a mega task that inevitably will result in some " Hits and Misses" as this was the case.Out of all the dishes I found only 3 that I really enjoyed. The Chicken in Pandan leaf was excellent. The Assam Prawns and the Sayur Kangkung were very good. I found the Tahu Telor overly sweet for my liking and the silken tofu much too soft. I prefer the normal Chinese Tofu . The best Tahu Telor that I have ever eaten was at Sanur Indonesian Restaurant at Centre Point a long time ago, before the change of owners The steamed fish was more sweet than sour. Somehow the combination of sweet and souringredients missed hitting the right note. The chicken dish with basil was just passable. As I don't eat Beef I can't say much about this item except that the meat looked a bit stringy and on the dry side. Decor.... In a nutshell " Over whelming " The 2 story Restaurant is smallish . On the ground floor there was only room for 2 large round tables. We were on the upper floor also with a limited number of tables . Every inch of wall space was covered with Peranakan screens and doors with elaborate carved motifs painted in gold and in any left over smaller spaces, nick nacks of little antique pieces of porcelain were displayed. Lined up on the ledge leading to the top of the stairs was a sizable collection of old tiffin carriers . All this opulence cramped together was almost too much for the eyes to behold but the one object that caught my attention was the ceiling lamp which looked " belle epoque" in style and quite out of sync with all the other items in the room. It looked lovely hanging down from an unadorned ceilingTaste in decor and food is of course subjective . I could not help thinking upon leaving the Restaurant, " Less would have been more 
5
Beautiful Peranakan decoration through out. Even their open space toilet on first floor is so awesome! Delicious food and very accommodating staff. Yummy pandan chicken, moist and tender. Tom Yum soup and Tauhu Telor were to die for. Overall food ordered were of very good standard
5
Best place to go to if you want to introduce a friend to Indonesian or peranakan food! Portions are pretty generous for the price as well. Also best to make a reservation if you're dining here at night or during the weekends. My favorite dish here is definitely the Tauhu Telor! Fried egg tofu that's incredibly crisp, drizzled with sweet black sauce. Do ask for sambal belacan chilli if you're dining in, it's quite spicy but very delicious. Other dishes to try: beef rendang and chicken buah keluak. They do well in gravies as well, very thick and bursting with flavor. ENJOY
5
I,m a hard marker but this gets top marks for excellence of food and value. Charming ambience and very pleasant and efficient service. You must try the soft shelled crabs.
Can,t wait for a return.
Also, it,s set in Avery picturesque neighbourhood.
4
I went several times to Bumbu in Kandahar St. My favorite dishes over there are the Tom Yam soup and the rendang. Food is good. Service is ok! The restaurant has nice Chinese peranakan decoration on both floors.
5
We eat here regularly and it's the only place where I've seen Crispy Kangkong salad, which is to die for!! Coffee chicken is good too and all the whole fish dishes. Then of course there is the Ayam Buah Keluak which is not to be missed. In addition to all this food the Peranakan antiques are beautiful, just like a museum. This is the Kampong Glam branch in Kandahar Street
4
I've been here for lunch with co-workers and lunch with my wife.The pineapple rice is awesome with a great presentation. Great to share.I've had the curry chicken and the coffee chicken. The Pandan chicken is a must.This place has some magic going on. Everytime I've been there, almost all of the tables have been reserved for lunch!The service is a bit lackluster. The food is great, and well priced too. If you have a large group, call ahead for a reservation. Open at 11am
4
I have dined in this outlet on many occasions over many years always as an invited guest of a local Peranakan family. We would always occupy the largest table on the ground level as we are a group of 9 to 12 diners and the matriarch has mobility restrictions.The owners are ALWAYS on site, always at the entrance, always pleasant and never over-bearing. Their omni-presence ensures smooth running in terms of service.Cooking, however, lacks consistency. What was mind-blowing on one visit may be lacking in seasoning on another occasion. I have developed an expectation of taste for certain dishes. I am disappointed when it fails to deliver. Since Peranakan eating involves a myriad of dishes, every visit has good dishes and the not-so. On the basis of cooking alone, I would give a rating of 3.5 but with the added touch of the bosses, I rate this 4 out of 5 overall
5
There is just nothing bad to say about this place! Even though I read that it was relatively quiet away from the crowd at Arab St, I made reservations just to be sure and sure enough, there was just one empty table left in the restaurant waiting for us when we arrived. I was awed by the decor, it made for such a nice dining ambience. As the portions did not look big on the menu, we ordered freely and were warned it was enough! Sure enough, the portions were generous and we could not finish. We loved all of it - deep fried kangkong, tomyam soup, assam prawns, steamed fish in spicy lime, bean sprouts. Prices are reasonable for the quality. I will definitely return and share this with the rest my family and friends. What a true gem
4
I think this place is a little under rated and I think everyone should give it a try. I think they place is located in a very 'low profile' area since that place is full of eateries. But your determination will be worth it. Upon arrival, the staff were friendly and we were seated. Then throughout the service, I had an enjoyable time. Partly also because of the friendly staff. The place is also well decorated and the atmosphere is just right.Next, the food is decent and the buffet is well worth it. You get a handful of selection and each brings out the trade of the theme where it's Indo-Thai style of food. The spice and everything is just right. Not everything is perfect in terms of the food. But I love most of the selection. Worth a try
4
Decided to go to this restaurant after reading some of the reviews on tripadvisor. The place did not disappoint. We were greeted warmly by the staff upon entering, and the interior of the restaurant was so beautifully decorated that it made us feel like we were in someone's home in Indonesia or Thailand. We ordered 5 dishes: the clear tom yam soup, the green curry, soft shell crab, stir fried kang kong and tom kah chicken ( or something like that). The food arrived pretty quickly, and although the portions are not that big, they were enough for the 5 of us. The tom yam soup had lots of ingredients in it, and so did the green curry. The soft shell crab was warm, crispy and yummy and was my personal favourite. The veggies were a little spicy, but the tom kah chicken was fabulous. White rice was served in generous portions, and many of the drinks were priced reasonably from $2 onwards. Overall we had a great experience dining at this restaurant and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the area

This was our second visit over a few months. Enjoyed the Tom Yam soup and cold tofu with preserved eggs, but main standout was the green curry. There are many nasi padang restaurants nearby that you are spoilt for choice, but you should definitely give this a try. There is another shop along the same corridor towards Sultan Mosque that sells mango or durian cake rolls that are also heavenly

Located at the quiet corner of the financial district near the Thian Hock Kheng Temple, Bumba offers many Indonesian food that is both tasty and affordable. Loved the atmospher and the great service rendred by the waitresses. The green curry is pretty good, and if you cant take spicy food can request for less spicy. The tomyam soup is one of the better ones served in Sg. It's filled with fresh seafood and has a kind of spicy sweet taste that is rich, not salty. Very unlike most tomyam soup in Sg. If you are not into spicy food, try the spring rolls (prob the best I have ever tried), gado gado (an Asian salad that consist of fried toufu served with raw beanspouts, long beans, crackers and a tasty sweet peanut sauce) and the tahu telor (fried egg white with super soft toufu and dark sauce)

I tried probably the best thai food I've ever eaten... I mean, better than in Thailand. Not all the dishes are the same quality, I liked specially chicken and beef...

When I walking around in Kampong Glam, actually I plan to try India or Middle east restaurant. Then, the plan only a plan.. We came to this place because being curious why this little restaurant had many visitors. I took Coffee chicken and nasi. Delicious and so tasty

Went to Bumbu this week after work. The little house feels nicely Thai, if a little pungent odour-wise. Furniture was a bit of an assortment but comfy enough.The menu looked like someone schoolchild had put it together as a project about 3 years ago - seriously amateur. But the food was wonderful.My buggest gripe: NO BEER ! I have some to associate Thai food with a nice cold Chang / Singha, but not at Bumbu

Was staying in he area and was looking for a restaurant to spend a quiet evening meal with friends. This looked like a restaurant that most people would walk by without a second look. but there were some reviews on the net which made it sound interesting, So after walking around the area we dived in, Got a table and looked around. Deco can be described as 'pseudo' antique but very well done. Mainly families eating there, good atmosphere and the menu was Indonesia..Food arrived 10 minutes later. Excellent authentic and tasty food Great service and when we left a $6 tip, the waiter almost gave it back to us as they are not used to tips. bill was $ 50 for starters and mains for 3 hungry chapsHala' and so no booze but the juices were great. Chicken with basil, squid, indonesian rice.- all the dishes were good .A bit diffficult to find but well worth the search

Finally got a table at Bumbu after a couple of attempts. The proprietors seem to lack confidence: the menu is a mish-mash of Thai, Indonesian and Peranakan dishes. What it really is, is a Peranakan restaurant, if the decor is anything to go by. And what a great Peranakan restaurant it is! We had an excellent Buah Keluak and Ngo Hiang - both are highly recommended. The service is quite good too, and the restaurant is reasonably-priced too. Wish it was in a different location, as the Arab St. area is too associated with Middle Eastern food

Small boutique Halal restaurant (so no alcohol available). Photos on the menu to see make deciding easy (although it all looks good), coffee chicken was exciting and the mango salad was great. 2 mains and an entree for $30. Thai / Malay menu, nothing but tastiness to speak of

Was lucky enough to be taken by our client to Bumbu for lunch today... Described as Indonesian was expecting the normal fare but was absulutely delighted witht the sort of Thai / Indo mix and the quality is super... especially for the prices. Dishes were about $10 Singapore each and we shared 4-5 between 4 of us. Tasty tom yum soup followed by some very fresh and flavoursome dishes but the green chicken curry was the stand out for me... very fresh and tangy flavours with much fresh lime through everything... It's pretty standard cheaps eats interior but the food is well beyond any of that

Bumbu at Kandahar street is an experience. Really good, home-cooking peranakan-malay-indon mix, very tasty. and made with evident care. The decor is nice old singapore and fits the neighbourhood. it's intimate and authentic, and the staff are laidback and friendlyBumbu at China Square is a food kitchen. bland, so-so food, cheap non-decor, desperate groups of office workers only there out of respect for their halal-eating colleagues. Don't bother. [message to Bumbu management: don't you think you're diluting your brand with the mediocrity at China Square?

A very unique place for Chinese Malay food. My favorite is coffee chicken and there is nothing down on the table. As a picky person on Chinese, I consider this place is very good. They do have some typical and atypical Chinese food. Try them all

We ended up in Bumbu Restaurant in Kampong Glam for lunch the other day. Bumbu has a fairly nondescript exterior and my colleagues and I could quite easily have ended up going 'next door', but we took a gamble and came out real winners. The menu is a little different offering Thai - Indonesian and Peranakan food. The menu card is complete with pictures which can be helpful to the newcomer / tourist. For us it was a business lunch. The surroundings gave the place an ambiance of 'days gone by' and the circular marble tables reinforced this. We received good advice from the staff and will undoubtedly reorder the Coffee Chicken on a subsequent visit. Which all led to a successful and satisfying lunch meeting. In a day and age when the memory of one lunch melds into another, and it is difficult to remember where you ate even yesterday, Bumbu is successful in being different, and what is more, for me, its unique selling point works. I'll be back!!
