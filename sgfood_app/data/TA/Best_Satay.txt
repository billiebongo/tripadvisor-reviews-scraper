We came here for after-party and had a great time. We were a big group of about 30 people, and the outdoor table was just enough for us. However we had to keep it quiet because there are houses around there

meat meat and more meat! Prawn, chicken and mutton skewers with a side of a few cucumbers. definitely the busiest, and the flavours did not disappoint!
5
I have been coming to this stall in Lau Pa Sat for years, and the standard of satay is always great and reasonably priced.
I highly recommend Best Satay for your visit to Lau Pa Sat, enjoy your satay with a jug of Tiger Beer!

Delicious, quick, honest - loved the mutton and need satay. The sauce was exactly what you’d expect and it came (obviously) Singapore style with cucumber and fresh onion.
4
Perfectly grilled mouth-watering satay and prawns, value for money. Return a week later to take away 40 prawns at $2 a piece for a party and everyone enjoyed it.
5
Have eaten here several times and have always found the quality of the food to be excellent, will come back again!
2
Possibly the worst satay I have ever had. Dry, poorly marinated and toughest meat. Even the chicken was tough. The prawn Satay smell strange and we couldnâ€™t eat them. At least the Tiger beer was a bit cold. We avoided these Satay for the rest of our stay.
5
If you like satay this is not to be missed. Stall 8 is the one we ate at and would definitely visit again. Although busy service is fast and efficient. Once you have ordered your food and paid they put it all together on a tray and then you find a table to sit and eat. There are drink waitresses that come to your table to serve you a nice cold Tiger beer. Wonderful open air dining at an affordable price

Store No.7 stand out in serving a very tender and chewy chicken satay. The peanut gravy is wonderfully prepared. The katumpat(rice), sliced cucumber and fresh onion rings are excellent when dip in the peanut gravy. Just that this is an open space eating place without the comfort of indoor air con might be a bit of discomfort for some.
5
This stall, number 7 & 8 has the best satay I've ever eaten in Singapore and Malaysia. The meat was so tender and fresh. The chicken uses breast meat, instead of the usual thigh meat, which is usually slimy.Absolutely loved the delicious and mouth watering chicken and mutton satay!As for the prawns, it was very delightful and pleasant as well, they used tiger prawns and it costs only $2 per stick! What a bargain! Especially with the heavenly taste and amount of meat you get per stick. On top of that, the shell is peeled on the stick! It has never been easier to eat prawn satays.And not to forget, the heavenly peanut sauce with compliments the satays very well. It has a slight spice to it, which really makes the satay sauce from this stall to stand out from the rest. If you want the best satay in Singapore or Malaysia, better get it from here! It's simply the best
5
Best Satay food joint is located in Lau Pa Sat. The setting on the street is quiet authentic with fires burning and various satays being cooked. We had prawn satays and they were pretty good. Nice place to go or dinner at night.
5
The name says it all! Some of the best satay we have ever had. Not the cheapest of street foods but definitely worth a visit. We had the chicken, beef and prawn and it was really good. Their peanut sauce was very good.
5
Awesome authentic Singaporean hawker Centre. Satay and fresh Naan bread was amazing. Cheap and good food
4
The Satay is the best in Lau Pa Sat, but the staff is impolite, the service should be improved.
There are chicken, beef and sheep Satay, I like the chicken the most since it is juicy, tourists can order shrimp here
4
On the side of the famous Lau Pa Sat. This hawker stand is deservedly call Best Satay.
Great really tasty.
4
Having read about this market we ventured to try it out. When we arrived the aroma from the cooking satays lifted the taste buds to a higher level. We enjoyed chicken and duck satays (20) which were cooked to perfection. The sauce was perfect and added a bit of zing to the meat.We enjoyed this meal with two beers and the total cost was a modest S$24 -- you can't beat that!Highly recommended

Back in Singapore as tourist, was looking forward for some great food. After googling found Best Satay Lau Pa Sat stall 7&8 with raving reviews. The buzzing street & flames looks great & felt Yes that is satay. but was disappointed with the taste when served with a sweet version of satay source, lack of authentic spice & heat, coupled with sweet satay sticks. The lack of contrasting flavours, was utterly disappointed, when spoken to the owner, she said is to cater for tourist taste. Honestly if visiting a country for their local bwest food & got a tourist version of 'local food', then there is no longer a need to travel across the ocean in hope to have the what used to be great satay
5
Absolutely delicious satay! We had a mix of chicken & prawn which we're both great and loved the satay sauce. Really worth a visit, surreal restaurant, your sat on plastic pop up chairs and tables in the middle of the city with huge sky scrapers around you! Very reasonably priced
5
Right outside our hotel, blocked off street and satay stalls as far as the eye can see. Sat down with these guys and was not disappointed. 60 satay sticks for $42 dollars paired with a Cold tiger.. awesome. Service isn't overly friendly but the food is great and arrives quickly. Great spot and we will return.
5
We had our satay in a little side street ( closed off to traffic from 7.00 pm ) beside Lau Pa Sat. It was very well priced and the service was slick. 10 sticks each of mutton,beef and chicken and 6 of prawns for S$26. Atmosphere was fun and the Tiger girls running around selling handles and jugs of cold beer. Don't sit beside the cooking area as you will come away smelling like a satay stick !!! Sit further in and they will deliver to you and don't worry about getting your change it will come right back to you.If you go ENJOY
5
I have written a review and uploaded photo's, but they didn't save so here they are again. Lau Pa Sat was excellent - see my other review.
4
I love their satay .. I tried others but I love this stall.... Is the best. my Favourite. The servers from this stall are also friendly and cheerful.
5
Located on the street between food court and Sofitel- packed. Lots of tourists, but also locals. Shrimps more expensive than beef/lamb/chicken. A little bit messy- you will not necessarily get beer before food. Anyhow, worth the experience.
5
'Satay Street' was right next to our hotel. The food is excellent but not inexpensive. The tables and chairs are somewhat old a bit grotty and cleaning them is not a priority. But the satays are simply superb. cheaper during the day than the evening. But the night experience has plenty of atmosphere as the smoke from the grills wafts over the crowd.
2
We ate at Best Satay 7 & 8 tonight. We got the chicken, prawn, and beef satay for $26. The food was great, but when I paid the waitress she didn't return with my change. I paid $51, so should have received $25 change. After asking for our change and nothing happening we spoke to the manager. She just started yelling at us! She questioned whether we had in fact paid at all. After being told off for a long time, our $25 was finally returned. Unfortunately, my opinion of this place was already damaged by then. I have no idea whether it was an honest mistake by our waitress, or if she stole the money.Please try one of the other stalls instead
5
A wonderful setting. Best to go in the evening when the road is closed and converts to an open air street food cafe. Ordered a combination of chicken and mutton Satays and they were delicious. Later saw the prawn ones which looked quite inviting. Supposed to be the best satays in town in a wonderful heritage location. Incidentally "lau pa sat" means old market - pa sat derived from pa sar in Malay or bazaar in Hindi / Urdu.
5
Located on Boon Tat Street. Very tasty satay!! Comes in chicken, beef, mutton or prawn. Our favourite was the chicken, we went back for seconds and even thirds. The owner Ainon was very friendly and welcoming and very lovely to chat to. Would recommend this satay place out of any in Singapore. Has won some very deserving awards. Will definitely be back next time we visit Singapore.
5
First visit to Lau Pa Sat, and can't believe I have been missing out on the most amazing Satay all this time!! When you arrive on Satay street, it's really busy. The stall holders all try and get you to buy from them - to be honest i was a bit taken a back by the experience initially as it's not something you regularly encounter in Singapore. That being said, it wasn't unpleasant and certainly wouldn't put me off going back. Some how we settled for a Best Satay and it was amazing. You sit down, tell the chap your order off the menu. We opted for a small (you can choose small, medium, large etc) which consisted of 15 chicken, 15 beef and 6 prawn which we swapped for chicken. They cook it, deliver it then you pay. We paid Sg$21 and it also came with 3 bowls of sauce. My only regret is that I had to share!
5
How simple can it be? Eating in the street (that closes to traffic at night), just outside the Lau Pa Sat (or Telok Ayer Market), this simple food that is so tasty due to the seasoning, to how is marinated and how is grilled. I had the mix of prawns, beef and chicken and was so satisfied, but didn't resist for an extra 10 of chicken. The drinks are ordered to another stand that is always passing by the tables. Singapore prices
4
At the Lau Pa Sat alfresco area, you will find mostly satay stalls by the numbers burning sticks & sticks of satay for the big crowd of diners there. Competition is stiff and it is good for the diners who could have a choice of ordering from the different stalls. The satay sold are made of chicken, mutton, beef, big prawns and some other meats that have been added to the original satay. It is always advised to order from the stalls or kiosks themselves than ordering from their runners who are everywhere in the dining area promoting their food. With so many diners eating satay, which starts after sunset, Lau Pa Sat has come to be known as a Satay Centre in Singapore
5
...A street dedicated to Satay! I love always already the smell of the charcoal when you are approaching and then you have to decide between all the stalls... Tipp: Try them all ;)
5
Perfect street food, what more do you want? Lau Pa Sat is a great place to bring visitors as well. Highly recommend.
3
These stalls are a tourist trap. Satay are only OK, beef quite good, chicken and prawn dry and overcooked. No rice cakes served and bland sauce. Guys, you could do better.
4
Felt pressured to sit down & order satay from the people walking around with menus. The satay is very nice & reasonable price.
4
Our taxi driver dropped us off on the corner of the food market, on his recommendation. We decided to walk around first to see what we liked, it was busy and every stall asks you to look at their menu, but didn't hassle us which was a nice change!finally we decided on going back outside to Best Satay as it had the nicest option for us. We enjoyed our meal and beers, nothing fancy, just satay meats.Lovely
5
I've been coming to Singapore regularly and always visit Best Satay 7&8 at Lau Pa Sat on my first night to get a reminder of what this city is about.Yes it's a bit of a tourist trap but the prices are okay the food is good and the beer is cold. And the buzz of the on street tables reminds you of what makes this city such a great food destination.Augment with extras from inside the adjacent hawker market if you can't face a pure meat and beer rush. The Japanese stall just inside is recommended as are the roti prata.You just have to do this at least one (every 3 months)
5
After multiple visits to Satay Street over the last 10 years there is no doubt in my mind that Best Satay No 7 & 8 lives up to its name. Consistently offering yummy Satay I always choose the combination with Beef, Chicken & Prawns. Matched with a jug of Beer (Tiger) it is an affordable and delicious way of enjoying some lovely food in a great setting. Not to be missed
3
It's all about the tourist here... obviously full of tourists the place is a $$$$ grab for the shop owners although there was a few decent meals throughout.High pressure selling, others trying to sell over the top of me whilst trying to make a deal and felt I was screwed over after agreeing to pay for Singapore Chilli Crab and ending up with plate of sauce with a large head shell (bigger than live one he showed me) a few claws and not much Crab meat anywhere...RIPPED!!!!!!!!BEST SATAY'S 7 & 8 did great job for us outside on street and do look the best overall, although satay's I wouldn't rate near a 10 out of 10 their service was great and allowed me to go look elsewhere first.A true experience which was great to see but couldn't say I'd rave on about it.Prices seemed okay, food about average.Close to city centre.Is open late
5
The best satay is outdoors at the side of the food court where they cook on open barbecues. Make sure you eat at 7&8 this is the real authentic secret recipie satay where you eat outdoors sharing a platter of succulent meats chicken, pork and langoustine marinated in the satay sauce with extra dip all washed down with a jug of tiger beer.Beware inside you will find touts asking you to sit and they will bring you food from 7&8 they will bring you food but it's not from 7&8 and you will pay more money, so make sure you are outdoors in front of 7&8 where you can see them cooking
2
There are a few stalls there and the one I tried, I think it was #4, was not good. I was approached by the stall workers.I would suggest trying a stick of satay from each stall to decide which is the better one before settling on one
5
The hawker food at the Lau Pa Sat is not to be missed at least once during any stay in Singapore! When you go, look for Best Satay 7&8. They have award winning satay and their sets are delicious!
2
This satay was recommended on TA but it doesn't last his reputation. It is very expensive and satay were not that good. But eating in the middle of the street is quite a fun experience. I think you can get better satay around.
4
went to eat satay in the lau pa sat street food arena...nice vibrant street food. we tried prawn and turkey satay...just a bit bland to our indian taste buds, else it was excellent in consistency and taste...
5
Great value, just the right amount of spice, and cooked beautifully.
Peanut sauce was spot on.
Service is efficient.
Truly with the visit.
20 Satay sticks SGD14.00
5
I'm a satay addict and can never resist it if I see it on the menu, but stall 7 & 8 still has the best satay for me. Service is also excellent and they're happy to customise if needed.
3
I travel to Singapore on a regular basic and never skip my favorite satay.I must say this trip, the satay were a great disappointment. Firstly, the prawns were cold and so were the chicken. The chicken were not well grilled. I guess they were overly busy and did not pay attention to the quality of the food served.Next time, I shall try the other stalls instead..
5
On recent visit to Singapore we visited here with a large group of friends (mainly locals)for dinner and loved it. To sit out in the open and try different types of satay as well as other food was a great experience and something different. It is very busy but you don't wait long for food or a cold drink. Would highly recommend this to anyone who just wants to experience a local way of eating and have a bit of fun
5
Beef and chicken satays. Beautifully marinated. Awesome peanut sauce.Wash it down with cold beer.What more do you need to know?Stalls 7 & 8 were the busiest when we were there. They were amazing. Maybe that's why?The street comes alive after dark with all the vendors, and loads of extra seating.An absolute must when in Singapore
5
I have reviewed this place before and it never disappoints. Do yourself a favour and go to stalls 7 & 8 at Lau Pa Sat and enjoy the satay they have to offer.The Aunty is always friendly and accommodating and recognises me every time I come there. I always come here at least once or more when I visit Singapore
5
You can't beat the satay at la pU sat satay stall 7 and 8. We have been coming here every trip to Singapore. This is where the locals eat. It's nice and tasty. The plates come in different sizes but have prawns, chicken and beef satay sticks and comes with the most amazing sauce. Very reasonable priced. Lots of fun watching everyone and seeing everyone enjoy there surroundings. You won't be disappointed
4
Recommended by concierge at our hotel. Stall 7 was great for chicken, mutton and prawn satays. Would recommend trying.
5
Go straight here, stalls 7/8 Best Satay. The prawn satay are a highlight, huge and well flavoured.
Great atmosphere and great food!
4
I liked the atmosphere of Boon Tat Street, where full of food stands opened after work.
Don't you expect sanitary condition or comfortable environment here but it's worth a shot to explore the local culture and delicious local food such as satay.
5
Vibrant setting, lively, but excellent service and value, with delicious meat and prawns. Beer was cold and very welcome. definitely recommend this satay stall for food and ambiance
5
This is the type of place that makes travelling worth while . Wonderful marinated Beef , Chicken and pork satay 26 pieces for 26 spd great atmosphere great food . wish we could get something like this closer to home .
4
A must try in town but this is really good Familly diner in our short trip in Singapore
The mutton ones are outstanding , some much taste and flavor
5
What a great spot to have dinner!!! The street closes at seven and within about 5 minutes is converted into an open air restaurant. Listen to the waiters suggestion about what size portion to order. They do know what they are talking about. Prawns are awesome, beer is cold!! A must when in Singapore
5
If you love satay cooked the way it's meant to be - over coals in the street - then this is the place for you. Every night at 7pm a small section of a busy road in the Financial District is closed off to traffic and the satay stalls appear! It is adjacent to a permanent food court/hall but the street dining is the main thing here. We found it very reasonable and you just find a vendor (our favourite is No. 7 & 8) and take a seat and order. Food comes pretty quick and is delicious! Be careful though. We were approached by another vendor selling Indian food and ordered 1 piece of Naan bread. When it came, he demanded SD$10.00. We chose not to accept or pay for this overpriced bread. There are waitresses who come around with jugs of beer which will serve 3 or 4 people with 1 drink each. They are quite pricey at SD$19.00. You can pick up drinks at a local 7Eleven shop and take yourself instead, especially if you don't like beer! The satay is fantastic. Just ask any taxi to drop you at either end of the closed off street and enjoy
4
We had a set of 20 each of chicken, lamb, beef and shrimp satay. The taste was great, particularly shrimp and chicken. The beef satay were slightly tio well done. I definitely recommend a visit to Lau Pa Sat when in Singapore and a stop at "Best Satay"
4
Located inthe heart of the financial centre, Lau Pa Sat is a recommended stop for street food lovers. Order Satay at stands 8-9, they are the best in town. A must taste is the Sting Ray. Do try also the Plum Juice ... Refreshing for the local temperature
5
Loved every mouthwatering bite of the satay goodness! Very well priced. Very well spiced! Cooked to perfection, I ate at this stall 3 times in 6 days. Can't wait to return!
5
These guys are making sure, that after a hard day of work, you have a nice evening meal. It is not nesecarry to try something else. Keep you're eyes open for Best Satay No. 8!!
2
I am a tourist and I think I got trapped. The satay was dried. Source was full of MSG. Prawn is tasteless. It's OILY.... Overall its no good. Hence, locals dont go there. I wont recommend it
5
What an experience great atmosphere incredible food. A very cheap meal for what you get, best satay definitely lives up to its name.
5
The guys weren't pushy like some of the other stores and the satay was delicious left full and wallet didn't get to much of a work out
5
We keep on coming back having lived in Singapore and now visiting regularly. friendly folks that provide fast satay that tastes awesome. Can ask for extra sauce, or cucumber accompliments. Buy some napkins from an uncle/auntie even if you don't think you need them... you will use them and they deserve the modest income to help them live
5
Best Satay really is the best at Lau Pa Sat (stalls 7&8). I have been coming here for years and its always consistent and the busiest. The Aunty is always friendly and you get looked after here. Wash it down with some cold beer and its just heaven!Best way to get here is to hop on the MRT and get off at Raffles Place and get out at exit "I" and from there it takes a few minutes by foot along Raffles Quay.Once you get to the lights at Cross St you will see the pavilion, pass it and the stalls are along the closed off road called Boon Tat Street. You'll see the smoke so you can't miss it!
5
This being the first time we've been in Singapore, the food & service was honestly so amazing at best satay. The lovely owner gave us the tastiest food & was so kind hearted & helpful as to recommending some great places to shop! Would certainly go back & suggest it to everyone I know
5
We have been eating here for many years and are always extremely satisfied. Everytime we bring new friends to eat here they are hooked. The satays are always fresh and tasty. The staff are always working extremely hard and are always smiling and happy to have a chat.
4
This street is closed to traffic at night and tables and chairs appear in front of the stalls offering various hawker food. It's am odd sight, street food in the middle of the Manhattan-like central business district. Each satay stick is pretty cheap, but also very small. The chicken and lamb were the best by far - succulent pieces of meat, smokey and sweet with a delicious crunchy peanut dipping sauce. we were staying in one of the high-rises that overlooked this street, so it was nice to grab some flavour on the way out, not so sure that this is a destination in its own right. I must say that once you ate enough sticks to start to feel full, it does become quite expensive, certainly more than you would pay at say maxwell street hawker stalls. But if you are in the area after 7pm, worth popping along to
