This is a pretty new eatery in Arcade. It's a pity it's located in Arcade which is known to make one smell at the end of a meal.Nonetheless, this is an excellent sandwich place. The sandwiches tasted good and the portion is generous. Can hardly finish it. For the portion, the price is really reasonable. Highly recommended
