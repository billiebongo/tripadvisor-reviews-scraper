Had family dinner on 15 February at Pool Grill, we were impressed by the excellent food and extraordinarily warm services, look forward to coming back soon.

This poolside diner is casual. It can get noisy, especially with kids around. Good is consistent and does not disappoint. Service is wonderful - efficiency with a smile. What can I say... its my regular joint!!
4
Average price for 2 including drinks is S$150The food portions are very small hence the 4 stars.Everything else is great: Ambience is perfect and so romantic being a pool side cafe. It overlooks the ION mall which makes the view even better.The steaks are juicy and very tastyThe staff is friendly and were nice enough to tell about the running offers I will definitely dine here agai
3
The restaurant was beside the pool and had a nice ambience. Quite and beautiful place to have a meal. The food quality was, however, disappointing. My grilled chicken was undercooked and the lobster linguine was not something I would have raved about. Rather pricey considering the quality of the food.
4
While waiting for my friend at the hotel lobby, i was approached by one of your staff, Rolando. I remembered he mentioned he is an ambassador. He was friendly & polite. He accompanied us to the restaurant. Good job! The food was great & ambiance was homey. All the staff were attentive

I brought my best friend to Pool Grill for her birthday dinner on 5 Jan 2018. We were delighted that we were seated at a table near the pool. It was a rewarding view of the lovely swimming pool and we both felt very strong holiday vibes. Great ambience for some quality bff time together!Our meal here was excellent. I had the braised pork belly served with roasted apple and baby asparagus. This was a great combination!The pork belly was soft, juicy and flavourful. My friend had the lobster linguine and it was very delicious as well, served with generous portions of lobster meat.In addition, the service is excellent! The staff continuously checked on us, always had a smile on their faces and helped us to take many photographs as well. It was my second time back here at Pool Grill and I am happy that the restaurant has continued to maintain high standards of food quality and customer service. Continue to keep up the good work, and I look forward to return visits here

Dined at Pool Grill with my mother, nieces and nephew on 28th December 2017. Dining experience was more than pleasant from the time we were brought to our table. Environment was peaceful and serene. The food served were savouring and delightful.Special compliments to Wendy, who gave impeccable service quality throughout. My nieces and nephews could not make up their minds on what to have and several orders were changed due to their fickleness. Despite this, Wendy was sincere and patient when taking our orders.When my niece accidentally spilled her orange juice and stained the table cloth, Wendy handled the situation professionally and swapped tables for us, before returning to her other responsibilities. She also served us with additional drinks which were spilled so that the children can enjoy their lunch.It was an amazing fusion of delicious food, excellent service and comfortable atmosphere. We will definitely dine in again
5
Good food plus Great service. Server, Kent gave us such a memorable dinner experience while we dine in for my birthday celebration
5
We had our Christmas Party at the Pool Grill and I must say with an event for 90 people and given the space with wet weather, the Team did very well. Thanks to the Kitchen and Service Team, which allows us to have a seamless evening and it all ended with a good note. Special mention to Kent, Manpreet, Misty and Chef Matthew and Chef William.... appreciate your kind assistance. Keep up the good servic

Lovely alfresco dining by the pool which is perfect for those windy/cool nights, if you’re a fan of aircon then maybe this isn’t the place for you. Service was very prompt and friendly, led by Preet. Our bread was also served nicely toasted, and refilled by the waiters later on. We ordered the foie gras and scallops for starters, as well as the cod fish and lobster linguine for mains. The food was delicious and well prepared, especially the cod fish. However, the lobster was a bit over cooked. Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience in a relaxed and comfortable environment. Would visit again someday!
5
Great food nice place and topnotch service. The food was just simply amazing! I would like to commend KENT for his attentive service. A very reccomended place surely will be back next time
5
Great burgers as always and fantastic service by Manpreet! Pool Grill is an old favorite and the food is great starting from the complimentary bread all the way through the courses!
5
Lovely pool view with cozy ambience with excellent servicing team having great connections with Preet, Selvem and especially Wendy. Good recommendation from Preet to split serve the three orders of wild mushroom soup for six of us, with shaved truffle in each of the six bowls of soup. The bread service with butter, balsamic vinegar olive oil is definitely a deliciously add-ups. The tea selections and coffee on the house complete our satisfied joyous meal.
4
Food was exceptionally good but the egg we ordered was extremely salty. Exceeded my expectations :) Will definitely go back to eat ! I love pool gril
5
Had a really delicious meal. Slightly on the pricey side but the food was great, and our server was absolutely top notch! Helpful, and really went the extra mile to provide good service. Thank you
5
Excellent service. Excellent location. Excellent food and drink. All of this located in the heart of Orchard Rd but without the hustle and bustle. It is Super peaceful on the 5th floor pool side area. Our waiter keshu was superb.
4
Took my friends to this restaurant and the feedback was that the food is good. However, I find that from the time of ordering till the food was served, it took quite a while. Even though the restaurant was not full house. So for those rushing for a quick lunch, this is not the place for you.
5
Food was fantastic, with very attentive and personal service from Ms Manpreet and team. The cod fish is highly recommended and for those who like red meat, the steak is juicy and cooked to perfection.
4
A relaxing place to have lunch on a cool day. (It's all alfresco) Misty, our server, provided us with great service. Very attentive and friendly. The food is great too although the price is a little on the high side for a poolside establishment. (the super tiny starter portion of grilled octopus was a joke though
3
We were impressed with both food & service during our first visit in 20 October, our mains Cod & Pork Belly tasted excellent and staff Kent is amazing. Our second visit on 4 November, however, was disappointing. Our appetizer Seafood Platter was a big let down, Crab & Lobster meat was extremely dry, 3 Oysters were socked in the ice water. Among the half dozen escagott, 1 of them was just an empty shell. A waiter came to ask us how we liked the appetizers, my husband told him the seafood tasted very dry, the waiter acknowledged it and simply walked away, we doubt he'd highlight it to the kitchen. Thereafter, same waiter still came to ask us about main course, well, for formality sake or for his own curiosity? We found it indeed weird and a bit hilarious.One more huge setback is the reservation system, when I called to make reservation at 1241hrs on 19 Oct, a female staff who sounded very unfriendly told me that Pool Grill was 'full due to a confirmed event on 20 Oct, when I personally went there on 20 Oct noon, a lady staff at counter warmly helped me with a reservation. Perhaps prioity at Pool Grill is reserved for hotel guests, but I don't agree reservation staff has the right to take her own liberty to chase away interested customers from going to the restaurant. Furthermore, Pool Grill was on 60% full at peak on 20 Oct night
5
Thanks a million to Ms Manpreet’s excellent service.We had a such a wonderful night!!!She is so kind & patient to us from the moment we walked in till dinner finished !Amazing service !First time here but absolutely feeling like home !Appreciate Ms Joanna’s great picture taken for us as well , wonderful memories left in our camera Best Regards Michelle
5
We thankful Manpreet Good service here. She is very helpful and patient. Food nice also.A big thank you to her
5
The restaurant is at the 10th level in the Marriott hotel, with a great pool view.The staff is super prepared and really kind.We had a Burger, one Cesar salad and a lobster bisque and everything was great!We definitely will come back for the great quality of the food and the amazing location.
3
Had the roast pork belly and lobster linguine. The roast pork belly was great - juicy and tender, but the lobster linguine was slightly disappointing. Pasta was a little tough and the lobster wasn't sweet. The drinks were good though; service staff recommended the strawberry with mint drink which was very refreshing
5
Friday night, I had a relaxing dinner with my friend. This place is located on the 3rd floor of Marriott Tang, the heart area of Singapore. The service was really appropriate and professional, the food was okay and served in large portions which u don’t often see in a restaurant of this level. Dinning besides the pool was not new to any of us but it was still pleasant experience
4
Good food, excellent service nice place to chill out. Overall good experience to dine-in. Will recommend to my friend
4
We ordered their signature dish seared lamb loin and pan fried cod. Both dishes were well executed. Bread was equally delicious. The cauliflower tempura in the cod dish could have more flavour, it was tasteless.
4
It's my 2nd visit to Pool grill and have good impression overall. Food portion was generous and delicious, quiet atmosphere which makes catching up with friends pleasant and relaxing. However as we were seated away from the main area, we had difficulty getting staffs attention whenever we need assistance
5
Even though the restaurant was relatively full on a weekday night, the whole restaurant retained its chill vibes. Prices were relatively ok, and the food was great. Service in the restaurant was impeccable, and I would like to thank Manpreet for the attentive service. I would definitely visit again
3
Part of the package deal at the Marriott was dinner at their Pool Grill, The venue is lovely overlooking the pool however the set menu was very ordinary. Ceasar salad was nice,beef sirloin I could have done much better myself as it was quite tasteless. We paid $105sg for I bottle of sparkling water and I bottle of New Zealand wine. I would suggest that at the minimum the water and a glass of wine or beer be included in the package.
5
We booked via Eatigo, and we came late we approach one of the staff and she adviced us to amend in the apps, but we cnt get thru, she jst assist to our prefered table which is 3rd table away from the pool. Her name is joana if im not wrong, a Filipino. She took our order as well and she is the one who notice we need the bill..We stayed their for 2 hours and we enjoyed.We will definitely come back. the Lamb was perfectly cooked as per our request. Keep it up
4
The ambience at The Pool Grill was just lovely, with views of the pool and Ion. Al fresco dining is fun when the weather is good. The food (cod and lobster) was well executed but the prices are on the high side. Best part of the experience was the service - just wonderful!
4
Love this little quiet corner of orchard road. The menu is not extensive but they serve some nice grill items. My favorite is the grilled king prawns - 6-7 huge grilled king prawns, served with your choice of sauces. Does. It come with sides though, you will need to order them if you want some fries or mashThe wagyu and fois gras burger is also very yummy- the slice of fois gras that comes with it is big and substantial. This dish comes with fries. I use the amex platinum card and one person dines free - great deal when u dine with one friend:-)Warning that drinks don't get any discounts though. Aside from a la carte, there's also a set menu daily (weekdays only I think), which offers a great deal for $35++. Have not tried it recently though. Stuck on king prawns:-
5
The food is all excellent, well presented and flavorful. Had the burger, lobster linguine and another pasta followed by the chocolate millefeuille. The burger was gorgeous.. really succulent patty coupled with foie gras that supplemented the flavor - never overpowered it. The food was all great but what really won us over were the small touches - the warm bread, the amazing butter alongside it, the attentiveness of the servers.
5
Celebrated my wife's birthday at the Pool Grill.The most amazing service in Singapore provided by Jonathan & Manpreet from the moment we stepped into the restaurant.The excellent food was made even more amazing by the top notch service & attention to detail, even when we were seated in a quiet corner of the restaurant.We will definitely be back
5
Manpreet was my server for lunch. She was very polite the entire time and made sure that my food is okay. I am coming back and will look for her again. Great service and awesome place
5
I had lunch at pool grill after having a quick dip in the Hotel pool. Manpreet was very kind to assist me. She made sure that everything I need was met. The food was delicious but the service made it extra special. I felt that I am a VIP guest which you don't get from most restaurants now. I am coming back and will surely meet her again together with her manager, Jonnah. To add, their bread tastes really good. Kudos to everyone.
5
Was there at around 6 pm. Had the delicious lamb chops with mashed potatoes, fresh bread and a beer. Excellent food and service from Miss Manpreet! Much thanks to her and her friendly team at the Pool Grill for making it a wonderful first visit for me! I will certainly come back again
5
We were there for dinner at 6.30. Even though we were late for our booking, the service team welcomed us with a smile, we were offered with some bread, Manpreet was very attentive, almost everytime we were approached for any requests even as small as a ice water refill, we were greeted with a smile. We felt really welcomed and comfortably enjoyed our dinner, food was great! The burger and lobster linguine was excellent! In fact it's one of our most enjoyed dining experience in the past 3 months!! Would highly recommend anyone to dine here just purely cause of the service, but theres also great vibe, good food and nice view during the evening.
5
We celebrated a friend's birthday and had a good time. The service was great; the staffs listened carefully on our instructions and delivered. The quality of the steak was great too
5
What was not to like, excellent food and service, couldn't ask for more...!! Plenty of choices on the menu an amazing bar and an amazing view of the pool and the surrounding buildings. Will definitely come back with some more friends of mine
4
I had dinner at the Pool Grill. The food was good (lobster linguine) and the service was friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing. Good place overal
5
My friend recommended this restaurant to me a couple weeks back. I didn't have any expectations at first, but when I ordered my food. It was great, their service and food was delicious and excellent. I was satisfied with my meal. I will surely be coming back to this place..
3
Steak quality is okay, we waited for a Long time and returned the asparagus as we found an hair inside. Later the same asparagus was returned to us with the comment that it was a fibre and not a hair. Not a bad place but should be much better for the price and ambition.
5
A nice place to celebrates friend Birthday, so Cosy & Relaxing. Thanks for the Amazing, Nice & Friendly Service of Mr. KENT, who Allowed us to feel very comfortable all thru out our dine. We will definitely comeback here. Enjoy the nice Ambience in the heart of city Orchard. PoolGrill is great place!!! Thanks
5
The food is as usual, excellent. The ribeye was wonderfully done. The mash potato was excellent. We also had the lamb chops which were also wonderfully executed. My family finished off with the Bomba Alaska. An excellent sweet ending.
5
Fantastic ambience and delicious food. Service was excellent. While we were there we were served by Manpreet and Jonathan, they were helpful and attentive to our requests.
4
A very nice romantic place for dinner. I love the ambience, love it that it is by the poolside. Staff are friendly especially Manpreet, she is friendly and smiley, making my husband and me feel welcoming. Food is good too..The Hokkaido scallop are fresh and yummy, the lobster linguine taste good too and my husband like the wagyu beef burger. Overall we had a great dining experience. Thanks
5
Visited Pool Grill on the 21st of August 2017, Upon reaching the Restaurant, Joannah (The Manager) Was attentive and received us and our reservation swiftly and smoothly. Excellent service were also provided with the rest of the team. Food was Scrumptious, especially the Lobster Linguine. It looks, tastes, and smells phenomenal. Kudos to the Kitchen Staff as well
5
Had a nice experience here especially with our server Man Preet. The oxtail Ravoli was great. Lamb Chop just so so
4
The Norwegian salmon and lobster linguine were delicious. The service staff (Manpreet) was attentive to our needs. It was an enjoyable and relaxing lunch experience there.
5
Manpreet was always ready for our needs throughout our classy dinner. Sirloin was very yummy and braised pork was very satisfying. We were enjoying the pool as we dined.
3
We were here for dinner on a Friday evening. Our server was Manpreet. Bread served to us was lukewarm.We had Lobster Bisque and Hokkaido Scallops with Caviar for starters.The Bisque was 4/5. Not bad.The Scallops was rubbery, dry and incredibly small. We were informed they were frozen, @Chef Please don't charge $32 for 3 Scallops if you are using frozen ones which will feel like you're eating a baked potato )do the caviar some justice)For mains we had the cod and salmon.The cod was good. It was a tad dry and a tad overcooked , but still good overall.The Salmon was hearty and made for a good meal.We had a side of fries. Which were a non event.Service however was attentive and polite.Overall Not somewhere I would come back to unless I happen to be around the area
5
Great food with excellent service by Manpreet to ensure that we are comfortable and that food was to our liking
5
I was there on a Wednesday afternoon and it had a quiet and relaxed atmosphere. We were greeted by a team of very friendly staff which greatly complemented the vibes that the restaurant had. I would recommend the lobster linguine as it was very tasty but not overpowering.We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday and we are thankful for the personalised slice of cake. Finally, we would like to commend the services rendered by Manpreet. She was sincere and forthcoming in acceding to our requests - definitely value-added to the overall experience
5
It was just awesome to have my birthday here with my friends, and I would like to specially thank Manpreet for the best service. The food here is also fantastic:)
5
I visited with my friends last week. At first,I like the atmosphere of this restarant inclouding Pool view . Also, The food was amazing! That was nice more than i expected . There was flavor of king crab soup, And I hightly recommended sea urchin pasta and strawberry yugurt panna cotta . The texture , taste , flavor .. everything was perfect . The staff, name is Kent was very professional and frendly . He knew how to serve the customer . I'll visit this restaurant again soon
5
I visited Pool Grill restaurant last week.The food and services was very impressive. Especially the chicken, it was really delicious and tender. The staff is really friendly too.It's nice place to chill and have a good food with friends.
5
Great food, especially the lobster bisque and cod fish main. Diverse selection of beverages, be it alcoholic or non-alcoholic. The staff like Ms. Manpreet were friendly and helpful in meeting our requests. All in all an experience I would recommend
5
My colleagues and I had dinner here last week and it was a fantastic experience. The food was delightful and the service was impeccable. There was a live station for salad by one of lady staff. she was very warm and friendly. I will definitely go back again next time
5
Let's talk about the meal first. First of all my GF and I ordered some salad and pasta for our dinner. The food were promptly served and it taste really good! Especially the texture of the urchin pasta was just nice, neither too hard nor soft. On the other hand my GF really likes the salad and shout out to Misty (waitress) being the one who served it freshly right in front of us.The atmosphere was really good too. Right in front of the beautiful pool.Whereas for the service, we didn't expect it to be that good. We were just there to enjoy the food but the service did amaze with their friendliness and promptness.Overall, recommended restaurant for either casual dining or special occasion. Especially those that are here for vacation, you definitely gotta try this place out
5
Thank you Kent for the awesome attention and super engaging service! Never experienced it in Spore - unprecendated!
4
Nice ambience, friendly staff and good food! The lobster linguine is delicious! It's a great dinning experience
4
We enjoyed a delicious, relaxed dinner at the pool grill. We started with a glass of prosecco and followed this with some very fresh & tasty oysters. The service was a little slow at first but picked up and the staff were lovely! We ordered a sirloin steak, grilled prawns and a couple of sides. Both mains were cooked perfectly. I particularly enjoyed that they brought chilled wine glasses with the bottle of PinotGrigio we ordered too. Manpreet served us throughout most of the evening & made the experience very enjoyable. She was friendly, patient and attentive. This was our second time at the pool grill and we will definitely go back. If I were to make one comment on improvement it would be that it's a little too quiet and could be better with a little background music to lift the mood a little more. Aside from that we had a wonderful evening!
4
Lovely view, Good Food. Love the grills. Will return, They can try introducing new items to the menu. Maybe some "specials" for the month...
5
Went here for dinner tonight - food and service were very good. Staff were so attentive and thoughtful. They were even kind enough and deliver our desert to our room as we were so full and needed some time to enjoy them. Strawberry panacotta - was a triumph....seconds please!!
5
Selvam, May and Joanna took great care of us and ensured that my wife had an enjoyable birthday dinner. We had the escargots for starters and it was out of this world. French onion soup and lobster bisque followed after that and we preferred the latter. We had the cod and lobster linguine as recommended by most of the reviews here and it was really good. Thank you and we will be back again 
3
Service rendered by Manager Joanna was awesome, ambience was good and relaxing with pool view. But food was average, taste was far from what i expected. The lobster was dry, lamb chop was ok but the sauce was super salty which spoiled the taste eventually. Aspragus that we ordered as side dish was also salty, same thing to the french fries. One thing that was good, happy hour for entire night where a glass of 500ml beer cost only $15 & the 330ml is $9.90!!
4
Cosy and relaxing atmosphere at pool grill. Food was good. Waiter was very attentive and helpful. Overall, a place to g
5
Was a rare occasion to bring family for lunch. Quality food. Everyone enjoyed. Wagyu foie gras burger was awesome. Lobster linguine was also great. Freshness of lobster. Attentive service by Manpreet topped off the experience
4
1st visited yday. Nice ambience. Food are nice. Staff are attentive and friendly especially Ms Manpreet. I received a surprised cake from them. We will definitely visit again
4
This would have been my 3rd visit to Pool Grill. The restaurant is on the 5th floor, next to the pool, hence, the venue is not air conditioned. Love the bread that they served while waiting for the food to be served. I love their Waygu beef burger, cod fish, lobster linguine. Food quality is good and tasty.
4
good ambience as beside the pool and facing the lighted up Ion mall.the lamb not really a good choice as lots of fats.bit stiff for the teeth as ordered well done
4
We celebrated my dad's birthday last week at the Pool Grill and our guests enjoyed the food and ambience very much. The service staff were attentive and efficient, not an easy task considering we took up almost all the space in the main dining area. The only misses that evening were the Lobster Bisque and Mushroom Soup which were both far too salty for our taste, and the Bombe Alaska, which failed to light up, resulting in a brandy-drenched dessert. Other than these, the other dishes were excellent, particularly the Oysters, Lamb Loin and Pan fried Cod. Thank you to the lovely staff at Pool Grill for making our celebrations that much more special
5
Visited this gem on a Wednesday evening to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The pool side ambience was cozy, the service was great, the food was tasty. Together, we shared the french onion soup, a seafood platter, a lobster linguine, a ribeye, and a chocolate mille-feuille. We were served by Manpreet, who contributed to the wonderful evening we had. Our food was served promptly, but by no means rushed. Throughout the courses, she was attentive to our every need. All in all a great place for couples, will definitely return here in future
5
We have lived in Singapore for 2 years and somehow missed this amazing little gem of a restaurant. We were lucky enough to be staying in the Marriott Tangs Plaza Hotel and just tried the restaurant once while here and playing at the pool with our daughters and relaxing. Since then we've gone just about every single night we have been staying at the hotel. The service is absolutely top notch and very attentive and paid great attention to detail. Honestly one of my favorite dining experiences in Singapore, and I feel fortunate we got to experience it as we're leaving the country. I only wish we found it earlier! The entire staff was absolutely the best and what you'd expect and more. Above and beyond expectations.Specifically, Misty and Manpreet went out of their way to ensure our daughters were enjoying themselves and we were all happy. We were all overwhelmed with their professionalism and attentiveness, and frankly it's always good to just meet great people. When coming back to Singapore, I will make sure I come back not just to have amazing food, but also to be greeted by such wonderful people. Thank you
5
The food was very very yummy and fresh! Pretty nice place by the pool and great great service by the staff members, especially Misty! Highly recommended!
5
The service was nice.The environment made me so comfortable. The food taste was awesome.The staff was kind.❤️Especially Misty and SelvamThey gave me and my friends a fantastic night.
5
The service was good and the food was fabulous. Great ambience to spend the evening with your loved ones. Swim and dine
4
Very nice food and attentive service. Will definitely return.One minor feedback on the cocktail - too little alcohol added
5
The food is great and the atmosphere is really chillWould definitely come back again! The staff were extremely helpful as wel
5
It was my last night in Singapore before my wife and I flew back to Vietnam and we wanted a nice quiet dinner and Pool Grill was definitely the place to be. Even tho we did not have a reservation the waitress may accommodated our request for a table near the pool. The food was delicious and perfect especially the cod fish and ribeye steak. The service was amazing and thank you to may for takin care of us! It was definitely a lovely night for me and my wife and we will come back here again
5
We recommend Pool Grill as a delightfully romantic restaurant to celebrate a special occasion. We made a reservation for 6:30 pm on a Friday night when the Grill opened for dinner, and sat at a lovely private table for two--I think it was table no. 11--with a view of the pool with cabanas and the lights of the Orchard Ion in the background. Mr. Selvam, who had taken our reservation earlier in the day, showed us to the table, explained the menu, and took our order. We were impressed that Moscato d'Asti was available by the glass. The cube of complimentary bread was excellent, and we were offered more if we wanted it. Our lobster bisque was very good. We shared a 180 grams tenderloin steak that was tender and juicy with peppercorn sauce, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. We had ice cream scoops for dessert. The whole meal was excellent, and the wait staff and Mr. Selvam, who showed great attention to our concerns, stopped by often to ask if we needed anything. The price was commensurate with the outstanding atmosphere, service, and food. We feel that all of these aspects of a romantic special attention restaurants are excellent at Pool Grill
5
I celebrated my Birthday there a few weeks ago and we all had a great time... the food is great especially the burger with foie gras ahhh and the lamb and more!... The staff are all friendly and warm plus the view of the pool and the city is a perfect background for dining...I'll definitely look forward to dining here again when we go back in Singapore...
5
After we finished our complimentary bread, the waitress offered to give us one more bread as our main courses has yet to come. The manager ensured that we had a pleasant dinner. The food taste great. It is a relaxing place to enjoy a delicious meal by the pool. (FYI, not air conditioned but it is pretty cooling
5
Been to this restaurant many times. It's time to comment on their food and service. Their Snr Guest Service Executive, Mr Selvam has good food knowledge and always ensured that diners were well taken care of. He would try to accommodate reasonable requests. Food served was rather palatable and quality good.The service charge computed should be based on the discounted amount and not otherwise. Hope the management will look into this matter.A.S
5
Alfresco Dining, with a breathe taking view of the pool, what more could you ask for. We opted for the $52 3 course set dinner with the 2 hours beer and wine special. Every dish was presented well and tasted sensational. The waiters were friendly and gave us excellent service with the beverages. Couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable dinner under $100.
5
I love Marriott burger that is why I love coming here. The best part about eating at pool grill is that you won't feel like you're in Singapore. It's like having a holiday at some tropical island in the pacific. The service is great
5
Kudos to all in Pool Grill restaurant. Delicious food, beautiful ambiance; last but not least the top notch service from the wonderful and friendly service staff
5
I had a lunch yesterday and I can tell this restaurant is one of the best I've ever had during my trips. Staff are very accommodating, very friendly and they show that they love their job. I will highly recommend this restaurant with amazing view of the pool to my friends. To the In- charge, thank you. you made my trip memorable.See u again
5
It was the second time my family and I dropped by Pool Grill to have dinner. The first time did not disappoint us, neither did this experience. We had a lovely poolside table with the gorgeous view of the pool during the night. Every food served tasted amazing and was done with such perfection you can tell the chefs would not have it other way other than to serve delicious food. The ambience was perfect and all around, the staff were brilliant. However, May's service stood out for us. She was the one who served us during our first visit and she served us again yesterday night, and she remembered us too! She recommended me to try the Wagyu Beef burger on my first visit, and she recommended me to try the Pan-Fried Cod Fish last night and on both accounts, I was never disappointed with her recommendation. Even though the restaurant got busier, she did not forget us but kept making sure everything was going well. From start to finish, her service was excellent. I look forward to being served by her again. I will definitely come back again for the delicious food and the excellent service this restaurant promises.
5
My typical day looks like this: getting into office at Orchard Road very early in the morning, knock out some critical issues at work, write or read something, and then, I will whenever possible, head to Pool Grill for my well-deserved private time. I love the staff here starting from Joannah, the lovely restaurant manager, to all the others who always eagerly treat me with cheerfulness and subservience. Despite having a small menu, the food here is always fresh, ranging from the simple asparagus or truffles fries to the delicate cod, oysters, prawns which always taste like they're just fished out from the ocean. The approach to their food is always genuine, not trying too hard to please, but yet the chef genuinely knows how to handle his seafood or the fowl to bring out their original taste and texture. Even the octopus entree is always tenderly marinated and delightful, and they will so kindly turn it into a main for me whenever I ask for it. Most lovely to me at Pool Grill is the fact that I can have a nice and quiet meal, often get to sit at my favourite table, and always given the space and privacy I need if I want to continue to work on my laptop over the meal. The fabulous team at Pool Grill certainly are well-trained to know both their food and their customers' unique preferences. Ultimately, food is just food, but it is the human experience and ambience which makes a place or brand memorable or delightful. Keep it up, Pool Grill @ Singapore Marriot Tangs Plaza! Cheers, Angi
5
This place means so much to us. We held our wedding here and right beside the Pool Grill was where we hold our solemnization. Food was good so every few months we would be back to dine here and have some romantic time together. There is a selection of food so we will never get sick of the food! They have added a new romantic dining area just right beside the pool and I will be back soon to dine in there! Sipping a glass of Moscato after your meal is super romantic
4
Third visit- mouthwatering! The grilled prawns and the lamb chops are my favourite. Lamb chops so tender ! Generous portions.The steamed broccoli with tomato salsa also really good
4
Very good food. Very good presentation. Nice bread. Very good service. Only things is the food took a while to come and the waiters/waitress didn't clear our table full of crumbs

We headed to Pool Grill, Singapore Marriott, for dinner last night. It was a simple dinner nothing fanciful but the freshness in the food we had was distinctive, a real test of the chefs' skills. Against a cozy ambience with a great pool view and skyline, the dining experience was made even more pleasant with the attentive and polite service crew led by the Restaurant Manager, Ms Joannah Singian
5
Love the oysters and buff wings. Great customer service. Nice ambience too. Nice place to chill away from the crowd of Orchard :
5
one of the nicest restaurant we've been and a romantic place to go to. foods are so delish and mouthwatering. service was great. special thanks to Ms. Misty and Ms. Lina as they are so accommodating and friendly.A highly recommended restaurant in Singapore.

After walking down Orchard Road and "exploring it", we weren't sure where to eat dinner on our first night in Singapore, so decided to just go to the Marriott's pool side restaurant. Our table had a pretty pool view and we had good service. We ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad, Norway Salmon, and Onion Soup. We all liked our food and agreed that the complimentary bread was especially delicious
5
My husband and I were lucky to get a reservation here on a Saturday evening. The food is absolutely amazing. The best Pork Belly I have had in years. My husband loved his salmon. The starters were tasty and light and the deserts were heavenly. I had the strawberry panna cotta and it was so creamy. My husband had the chocolate Mille-feuille with salted caramel and oh my god, delicious. Definitely worth a reservation if in the area
5
We had a very enjoyable dinner at the Pool Grill. Whole family enjoyed ourselves. Steaks were done to our liking, serving size was generous. Service staff always smiling and ready to answer all questions patiently!We will definitely be back! Thanks very much

My family of 8 recently celebrated my mum's birthday dinner at the Pool Grill. We were there on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy (although they did advise they were full house).It's located at the 5th floor of the Marriott Hotel along Singapore's Orchard Road, right by the hotel pool. We were seated in the area away from the main area - somewhat near the smoking corner and the changing rooms - but that didn't bother us much for most part of the evening.For mains, we ordered 5 steaks (a mix of sirloin and rib eyes), as well as 3 sets of their poached lobster tail and beef short rib. For dessert, the restaurant was kind enough to organise a simple slice of birthday cake for my mum and the staff chimed in with a birthday song.We also ordered 4 sides of fries, broccolini, potato fritters and asparagus which were very expensive for the size of the portions (compared to other steakhouses like Skirt at W). We thought that the food was good but in no way great. The portions were sizeable but the food was just average and the beef cuts weren't exactly premium.All in all, we should probably have gone with the set dinner which at $48 would have been a better deal than the a la carte items
5
Was there for dinner with my boy friend and love their service. Caesar salad was a hit, love the garlic parsley butter Escargot and the soft fragrant bread. The waitress did a good job recommending the Australian shiraz to pair with my Tenderloin. But was a little disappointed with the tenderloin lacking the char grilled flavour and the lobster tail wasn't that fresh. My boy friends rib eye medium rare was really bloody and they was kind to replace a new medium well rid eye which tasted fabulous! Overall a lovely pleasant dinning experience with a nice scenic view of Orchard
5
The food is great, the staff is beyond helpful. They went out of their way to accommodate our requests. Spent an afternoon relaxing and enjoying great drinks and food by the pool.
4
We decided to stop into the Marriott Singapore to purchase a bottle of water as it was, of course, extremely hot outside and we had finished the water we were carrying. The young door man took us to the Pool Grill. When we saw how lovely it was we decided to have lunch as well. It was a beautiful outdoor dining area with tablecloths and a lovely atmosphere. The food was delicious and served by lovely servers. We would recommend this pleasant surprise. We really enjoyed ourselves.
4
My Friend and I went to lunch and had a lovely meal with great service. The 3 course set was perfect
5
Hello,I made a reservation and requested for the cabanas which is outdoor for a birthday celebration. And lucky me the weather allowed us to be outside with some breeze. The whole team including our special own assistant, (Pawan) who serve us all the way till the end of the dinner are all very attentive and with a smiley face on their face with knowledge of all information including the hotel details when I ask about the hotel room information. And they are very kind enough to specially allow me to sit at cabanas without ordering the set menu. This flexibility make everything easier the choice of food me and my partner wanted to try. Well, this is my very first time doing a review online so I am not good at expressing myself but just wanted to say thank you Pool Grill and the reservation team for the great and warm assistance for this celebration. *For those that are opting for cabanas especially for guys, you may want to wear a short sleeve shirt but of course still in smart casual style. :) Hopefully the restaurant can consider air conditioned for the cabanas and build with a glass dorm which is still transparent so no matter what weather, everyone still able to enjoy this place and view. Because I realise if having alcohol drinks will become quite hot even with some breeze. Build a glass covered up air conditioned, those that mind their hair to fly around will not worry about their appearance of looking messy anymore! Thank you.
5
Great ambience and staffs on duty were very friendly and attentive to our needs. PAWAN was very friendly and attended to all our needs. The other staffs on duty were also full of smiles and even surprised us with a slice of cake. Great food and a wonderful experience.

We had booked our annual Christmas dinner at the Pool Grill with the BBQ Buffet option. Food set-up was efficiently done and displayed well. Location with view of surrounding Orchard-scape and pool backdrop was really picturesque. The BBQ food was interesting with variety and pretty tasty.Only let-down was due to proximity to the Guestrooms we were advised to keep to a minimum volume which was tough and kinda dampens the mood with all the merrying and celebratory mood going on. However the staff were very understanding and helpful; special mention to Catering Manager Mr. Mano and his Team were very accomodating and efficient in ensuring the smooth set-up and success of our Christmas Party! Kudos to them! Overall a really enjoyable experience hosting and having our first Christmas dinner celebration at the Marriott Hotel Pool Grill
3
Service was decent but I was greatly disappointed with the quality of the food. All our mains (lobster with beef and pork chop) were too tough to chew. I didn't even finish the beef. However, oysters were big and fresh.
4
Made an online booking with the website to celebrate anniversary there. Saw their special promotion for the set menu which quite worth it. Though they ignore the special request for a more quiet place but overall is ok.It is open space concept with only fan available (no air-conditioning). Environment is ok as you can see people swim or dip in the water around. But I wouldn't recommend for those who want to try out their dinner at the cabana as you will have people around looking at you on the other side. They have a vast variety of wines list selection from less than a hundred to few thousand dollars. Food taste is good. Service is above average. Worth the money in overall I would say.
4
We'd heard about this place from friends and decided to try yesterday. Thanks for a great lunch, food was tasty and a peaceful atmosphere by the pool.Staff got better as the meal went on, started off by not giving us the set lunch menu, I can only see this as an attempt to make people pay overpriced amounts that seem to be on the à la carte menu. Had the wrong salad brought to me but then everything else was good, great value for the $35 3-course set lunch, amazing flavoured bread.Would visit agai
5
Really attentive staff. Love the steaks and the fragrant bread provided before our mains. Great for dates
4
Enjoyed a nice lunch next to the pool in a quiet setting. The food is average, Marriott quality (i.e.not one of the specialty restaurants), but the quality of the food is good and the ambiance is very relaxing.
4
This place is a hidden gem. I love the Mediterranean setup with all white furniture and a view of the pool. It's beautiful in the evening. The staff are very attentive and accommodating. The French onion soup is on point, I love it! However the mushroom soup lacks texture and is too dilute. The lobster linguine didn't give me the oomph as well. The grill lobster was cooked just right. Sides were lack luster as well - asparagus, fries and salad. As it was my first visit I checked with the reservations lady if bermudas is allowed as dress code since it's an alfresco venue and I was told no. So my husband cooperatively wore his jeans. However we saw several male diners decked in bermudas and even flip flops! My husband wasn't very pleased of course as he would really have preferred to be more casually dressed. I didn't like this inconsistent standards either. Well I really liked the atmosphere and that I could use my Amex dining privileges here, so I'm giving it four stars. Otherwise it would have been a 3..
4
The pool grill has a nice ambience, especially on a clear sunny day. The food is nice but as with most things in Singapore, deeply overpriced. So i came here because i had a credit card discount which to me made the dishes "acceptable"
5
Nice place setting served with nice food Cosy place to dine for special occasions and a great view to enjoy .
5
Good food, good service, good ambience. Exceeded my expectations. Very meticulous and attention to detail by the personal waiter.
5
It was another lovely Singapore night, warm but with a pleasant breeze. We were celebrating my husband's birthday with family and the evening couldn't have been more enjoyable. The staff were warm and friendly to us and we were served a delicious meal in a timely manner. We ordered the escargo as an appetizer which was particularly nice. The French onion soup was delicious and the bread was also tasty. My husband had the Wagu beef burger. It is a bit too tall to eat in traditional sandwich style and the environment was too posh to do this anyway. My husband's son had the linguini with prawns. All the food was delicious. This restaurant is a nice alternative to the Marriott Cafe buffet and it is a lot easier to keep from overeating. The best part of this dining options is the tranquillity of the pool-side environment. One of our best dining experiences in Singapore. A bit pricey, but definitely worth it. A special shout out to the staff including Manor and Misty. My apologies to other staff members:you were all great. Thank you all for a special evening.
2
Came here for a relaxing lunch. Staff dithering from the get go, despite there being only one other customer.Ordered the Greek salad which claims to contain feta cheese. Ok, there were four pieces of it in the entire salad so I suppose they were telling the truth, but really? Four small pieces??The salad arrived without any dressing so had to hunt that down too.The lettuce was thankfully fresh and crispy, but S$17++ for a bowl of chopped lettuce and hopeless service is beyond a joke.Marriott have a great location here right by the pool but they seriously need to deliver a service that matches the prices.
5
I was beyond spoilt. Best day ever. Thank to the amazing Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza team for the incredible food and excellent service
4
Decided to have an atas lunch with daughter and this cafe is by the pool side. I must say Marriot Hotel has a really nice and swanky pool. Eating your lunch here and watch folks chillax by the pool generates a very peaceful feeling. I opted for the grilled cod and it was fresh and perfectly grilled. Layer of grilled crisp on the outside and soft buttery fish on the inside. Very good!Daughter ordered her usual pasta and they don't have a large selection so she decided to try their lobster linguine. It's not a tomato nor cream base pasta, more like aglio olio style. The lobster is quite big and it was fresh. However, I found the pasta a tad under-seasoned. It's not bad. We were greedy and ordered a mash potato to share. It's served in a tiny cast iron pot but the flavours are spot on and the creamy texture had us both hooked! Social politeness prevented us from licking the pot clean. HehNot a place to have regular lunch as it is atas but service is great and it's overall a very enjoyable experience.
5
Good service, thanks for helping us with coffee and fruit punch :-). Good fish and delicious dessert
5
The Pool Grill is located on the 5th floor of the Marriot Tang Plaza and has air-conditioned and outdoor seating. Modern fusion menu was offered with very good cocktails. I settled for an excellent rare steak with bone marrow, bÃ©arnaise sauce and asparagus with parmesan flakes. Very good indeed with attentive, well trained (but not obtrusive) service. It was nice to be able to totter only 15 yards to bed
5
Great food and best service at Pool Grill, Singapore Marriott Hotel. It is a comfortable restaurant with fans only (it's non-Aircon) which next to swimming pools. Thumbs up for their best service with cares from the waiters, waitresses and the manager. Beside Ala Carte Menu, they have monthly Lunch set(S$35++), Dinner set(S$48++) and also kids menu. A must try to their very tasty crusted lamb loin, definitely great value for money
5
My partner and i visited the Pool Grill on a Friday night after seeing that they have a promotion on the Entertainer App. When we arrived, it was a nice environment, cool and breezy. Service was prompt and i would like to highlight how friendly Alvin was. He was enthusiastic in making drink recommendations and i only got to know he is the mixologist later. I wish he had told me earlier and i would definitely have tried a concoction from him. Food wise, i had the cod fish and it was cooked to perfection! One of the best i have had before! My partner had the grilled lobster and it was fresh! We had the sides like Asparagus and Fries which was good too. The only disappointment i felt was the Ceasar Salad, it lakes a wow factor, especially if it is one of the "chef's recommendations". It tasted like any other cheap salad you can find anywhere else. The other suggestion is to have the tables slightly further apart. The guests beside us were speaking pretty loudly and it got a bit annoying after a while. I am not sure how this experience could be made better except perhaps space the seating out? Overall, it was a good experience and we would consider going back again cause of the great service and good food
5
Very attentive and always smiling. Very interpersonal skills!Thanks for your great service, Mano Karan!!
5
We gave visited this restaurant twice. Food excellent. Staff axceptional.our waiter Mano and others were so accomodating. Lots of fun happy snaps. We really felt welcome. Brilliant atmosphere. Try the cod - delicious. The lobster linguine gas to be tasted to believe
4
Mano has been help & serve our table w/ a very good manner & helpfull...& d'kids are happy w/ their meals too. D'athmosphere very nice since it's close by d'swimming pool...so hv a fresh air & wind on our table. Thank u all here...u're all very kind...   
5
Came here for set lunch, especially the beef cheek it has a melt in your mouth texture. Totally love it, cod tortellini taste awesome with a taste of the sea. Service is great and surrounding environment and ambience is such a perfect place for a date with my Wife on her birthday
4
Dined at this place with friends on a Friday night. Service and food excellent and cooked to order. Great ambiance in the heart of Orchard but without the noise. Will come again and Entertainer App really made it worthwhile
5
I would recommend for a relaxing lunch with high quality food. Food was outstanding- full of flavour and perfectly cooked. Service was EXCELLENT and I'm tough to please. They were even kind enough to accommodate us while my kids were dripping wet from a swim (other customers were all nicely dressed). They were very sweet and gentle with the kids which means a lot to me. A lovely lunch overall.
3
The restaurant offered free flow bread which is always a plus. I ordered the French onion soup, lobster pasta and wagyu steak. The amount of soup given was so little. The bread soaked up majority of the soup until there was really none left. Lobster pasta was ok, no complaints but nothing to shout about either.Wagyu beef was tough, totally not decent wagyu quality. (the quality of the beef before they started their renovations was much better
5
The pool and surrounds are very clean and inviting. We ordered from the pool menu as we were reading and lounging around the pool. it is a small, casual menu of burgers etc. but all you need as a snack
4
The oysters were fresh, quite near to the ones i had in New zealand. They were at a reasonable price of $27 for 6 pieces. The cod mains was smooth and silky. Sides of beer battered potatoes were unique, and i had it both times i visited! My friend had the grilled prawns and lamb, which were done very well. Draft beer was costly tho, at $15 for half a pint! I suppose i would skip that in future
5
Had the wagyu beef and foie gras burger this time round by the pool... The beef was perfectly done...medium rare.... The highlight was the foie gras... Well done Chef... Highly recommended... The oysters were rather big, succulent and fresh!! Special mention. Associate Lisa, she was very attentive and one who uses her initiative, to serve our soup in 2 portions when we mentioned that it was to be shared... Will come again!
5
The service and food was great at the restaurant. Waiter and waitresses were especially attentive throughout the night and very thoughtful to ensure that we had a comfortable evening. Special mention to Lisa who served our table, she was very considerate and met the requests from the table very promptly and always had a smile while doing so. She also arranged a surprise birthday cake for my brother as well. The ambience next to the pool and on the fifth floor made you feel like you are away from all the busyness of Orchard Road.The food was really good and three out of the four guests ordered the Wagyu Beef with Foie Gras burger which was done to perfection. The meal was made even better by the fact that we could use the Entertainer App to enjoy the 1 for 1 deal
5
Pool grill is a secret hideaway from the hustle and bustle in town. The service was very welcoming and food presentation was wonderful. The restaurant was located beside the pool which creates a relaxing mood. Wonderful afternoon spent
3
Everywhere else in the hotel had excellent service but for some reason, this restaurant is challenged. Very slow to even pour water when I arrived at the table. Had to ask for the wine list, confused my order twice, and super expensive for quality of service and food. The view is lovely (overlooking the pool) but I would not choose to eat there again
5
A bunch of us gathered here for a birthday brunch and the service from the team was top notch! Great food (the burger was nicely done!) and a nice selection of beers and wines!
4
Attentive service with good linen and wine list. Food good to excellent. Well trained staff in very central location for shopping but quiet and secluded.
5
The ambiance was perfect for a dinner date and the food was totally delicious. Although it was my first time there, my and my girlfriend indeed had a great time and we will definitely come back! Kudos to all the staff there
5
We met a friend for dinner at this restaurant. It's located on the 5th floor, Marriott Hotel Tang Plaza. The staff warmly greeted us and promptly showed us our table. This is an open air poolside restaurant. I was worried it might be too hot for outdoor dining. It was comfortable with a slight breeze. The wine list is quite extensive. We had Greek salad- fresh ingredients, generous amount of feta cheese and flavorful dressing. The steaks were excellent- cooked exactly how we wanted it, tender and juicy. It came with grilled bone marrow- a nice treat. For a few extra $$, we added foie gras. The grilled asparagus was seasoned just right, tender inside and firm/crunchy not stringy. They offer cheeses and decadent desserts to end the meal- all were delicious and artfully presented. Service was very good- friendly, attentive and not rushed. This is a great place to enjoy a relaxing dinner.
5
Great place for a quite dinner and wine over looking the pool, also a great location for a lunch meeting
5
Have a great dinner with friends, nice atmosphere with looking thru pool view.We enjoy the excellent and friendly service from Misty, Selvam and Kathryn. The food was decent.
5
First impression : such a relaxing outdoor pool side view with great blends of lightings from the pool and surrounding areas (ION especially). Wind was alright, not too still or too strong. Yes, it's an important factor for me. Hair flying around in an outdoor setting is a nono for me.. Service was prompt and efficient. Escargots were alright. Love the whole lobsters. Lamb was tender. Ended the night with cocktail and Bombe Alaska.
5
I'm sure this resturant is best place to eat and having good view. If someone gonna looking for romantic place, I recommend pool grill certainly. Their service also very nice
5
I had a wonderful time here with my friends, the service was fast and efficient. Misty, Selvam and Joannah was very efficient, patient and friendly. My friends and I really enjoy our experience here and we would gladly come back here more often
5
Marriott's pool grill is a relaxing spot to unwind after a long day. My boss and I together with our friend had a pleasant dinner here and we all trilled for how they prepared their Ceasar salad alongside our table plus that grilled tiger prawns was superb. Two thumbs up also for their cod fish. Thank you to Miss Joannah who attended us politely and the rest of the team for the very warm and wonderful service. Indeed we had a sumptuous dinner. Sure thing gonna drag all my friends here to savour the great food, lovely and relaxing ambiance and specially the amazing team. It was worth the experience
5
The ambience was really nice and perfect for the hot weather in Singapore. The food was really tasty and flavourful add up a nice wine list to it. On top of that, the service provided was indeed top notch. The staff especially Joanna was very warm and welcoming. They made me feel very comfortable and anticipated my needs the whole time. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and family, and will surely be back soon!!
5
Great venue for outdoor dining whether rain or shine. Good for bar type dining or fine dining. Little bit of nature in the heart of Orchard Rd with poolside flora. Very friendly staff.
5
Amazing ambience.
No crowd and good bread to keep you going!
Pool offers a good view of Orchard.
Portions are light as its fine dining style.
Staff are really friendly and patient, never fail to make sure you feel at ease.
5
had dinner with the family and we enjoyed the semi-outdoor setting next to the pool on the 5th floor.
the food was excellent and the service was fantatic.
5
Pool Grill restaurant might not have the best ambience nor view to impress your date, but they more than make out for it with their impeccable service and attentiveness.I'm usually not an advocate for reviews but would love to take this opportunity to commend the excellent work of the following staff - Kathryn and Misty, whom have put on a great attitude from the moment I step into the restaurant to the moment I left.They have took great lengths to ensure me and my partner were provided with the utmost attention, even from the smallest details to check on our preference with each dish served.All in all, the wonderful experience and service has much outweigh our expectation. Thank you Pool Grill and we look forward to dining at your restaurant in the near future!Yours sincerely,Andy To

Love the pool view and make me feel like i was in some high class thailand resort, service was prompt and attentive but food had hits and misses. We ordered the seafood platter, oysters were fresh but not meaty. i felt that the crab, lobster and prawns were not appetizing and did not taste freshly prepared. The lamb wellington was lukewarm, blend and was not juicy, not worth the price. However, the rib eye was generously proportioned and cooked to perfection but i would have preferred the sauce to be less salty. The sauteed mushrooms would have looked more appeitizing if served on some other plate instead of a black pan.The most interesting dessert was the alasaka bomb, i really liked the fire display, edible flowers and the alcohol with ice cream. Best dish of the night. Overall, nice place to hang out with the great view and nice initimate ambience, but choose your dishes wisely.
3
Came with my family member to try out this final restaurant at Marriott before deciding if we should renew the membership. To our disappointment, this restaurant is only good for its view across ION and the scenery, the food is kind of substandard. We ordered grilled pork, grilled cod and salad. The pork is not well marinated and it is quite bland. The cod is not very fresh so the cooking method of its use of ingredients doesn't matter anymore. However, the salad is really nice but not nice enough for me to renew the membership
3
Nice small restaurant with a beautiful pool vista. Once seated, were offered menu, but no drinks menu? They came to take our order, and I had to ask for a drinks menu. Had a drink and first course arrived. There were wine glasses on the table, but the drinks menu we saw didn't include wine! That was another "secret" menu, which they brought over. Apart from the unashamedly rip off prices for wine, which is the norm for Singapore, the wine list was comprehensive with bottles starting from $88. Staff were very friendly and the food superb.If you're a visitor to Singapore looking for a WOW venue, this is not the place, however it was very pleasant
3
We stay just adjacent to the Marriott hotel and therefore visit Pool Grill quite often. We have been there in the day and evening and since its alfresco, the weather is more comfortable in the evening, plus the ambient lighting in the pool is really quite nice. If you are in for atmosphere, this is a place where you wouldn't need to burn a hole whole enjoying a lovely evening. Pool Grill has a menu that offers a diverse range of choices. The quality of the offerings are surely above average but I wouldn't consider any of them impressive nor memorable. However the waiting time is really long and I would advise you to order whatever you want in the same round. Service is quite friendly, and efficient, but not excellent.I would rate the food 3.5 stars, and the atmosphere 4 stars. However the waiting time is definitely 2 stars so overall I think it Pool Grill deserves at most 3 stars
5
My friends and I (3 of us) had lunch and dinner at this place and we enjoyed the food and service. I like the pasta with lobster. The wine selection is also commendable
5
The dining experience in Poolgrill was amazing. The ambience was great and we had enjoyed a scrumptious dinner and excellent service. Special thanks to Misty and Selvam who is always attentive to all our needs
5
Really everything you need for great city views and a beautiful poolside; we had a Bar B Q business social here and it was perfect
5
Great quality of food, good ambiance! service is ok,, slow sometimes but overall experience is excellent!
5
Great quality food but limited with food choices. Service could be a bit slow if busy. Relaxing atmosphere though to be by the pool.
5
Stunning views of the city from the pool terrace, only sorry we didn't take our swimmers. Good fantastic and staff great.
5
Its a great n amzing restaurant. Good enviroment .. Good food.. Good services.. all of you must come..
5
An oasis amidst the crowded Orchard road. Simply stunning with fabulous food and service! Came here for lunch with colleagues and am blown away by the service
5
I was beyond spoilt. Best day ever. Thank you Dieter and the amazing Marriott team for the incredible food and excellent service
5
Look, it's a POOL GRILL, so don't be looking for foodie heaven. Look for grill fare, well prepared, served Al Fresco with good drinks.In this sense the Marriott Pool Grill hits all the right notes and moves beyond with flawless execution of seafood. Special mention goes to the grilled tuna (served nice and rare) with skordalia.This has become my go to place at the Marriott for inexpensive (hey, it's still Orchard Road in Singapore!) good food when I'm too tired to go out.Good service, friendly, not pretentious.A real gem
5
Yes, it did. How could an exterior/interior dining venue offer a fine dining experience that would be memorabile? A very large ceiling fan and other small fans make the seating areas comfotable. A menu that offered interesting choices and attentive, welcoming service exceeded my expectations for a very good dinner. Wines are not inexpensive. Welcome to Singapore
4
Stayed at the Marriott and needed to get lunch on first day after midnight arrival from USA. We were the only people eating lunch early and had a very nice lunch, next to the pool. You wouldn't think you were the middle of a big city on Orchard Road
5
This restaurant is fancy, delicious, good service, good view, clean, good location, not expensive,,, perfect! As I ordered one pasta, I could eat bread with olive oil and some spices or paste as well. You should go here. I'll go here again, DEFINITELY!
5
I would recommend everyone to visit the restaurant if youre staying at the hotel. Such nice settings. Service was great , food was awesome & great ambience
5
Therapeutic setting ambience. Spacious, cozy and modern. Food was on point. Customer service was splendidly performed by Tiara the friendly lady. Felt all welcomed. Pleasant and satisfying visit overall.
5
Loving the ambience of the setting. Spacious & cozy. Food was on point. Cust service was splendid ( served by the very friendly "Tiara" )
4
Nice ambience and cosy.Staff are friendly and they provide good service. Food is alright. Will return when I have the time.
5
The pool looks so attractive , clean and ambience feel refreshing.The scenery of people enjoying themselves is sort of inviting that we are almost tempted to pay use the pool facilities but since we don't have extra clothes with us we instead opted just dining as planned.Food was great and service is fast, staff have been very helpful with recommendation for food and drinks. A must visit bar
5
Restaurant recently renovated. Airy and bright (in fact 'white' theme with white sofa, comfy chairs and table cloths). Very relaxed given sunset view for dinner. Food ordered was delicious and very filling indeed. 3-course definitely enough to feed alongside complimentary warm bread. Choice of wine extensive but price slightly on high side. Service was excellent with each wait staff genuinely courteous and helpful. Kudos to whole team! Highly recommended dining place. ** Do ask for Main area dining during reservation (best if can secure pool side dining view)
4
Walked in one evening to have a dinner as I was in the area. It was around 5pm, I believe. The restaurant was empty when I arrived and we manage to snag a seat if we were able to commit to leaving by 6.30/7pm, so please do make a reservation.As for the food, I ate cod and my partner some sort of chicken. My partner claimed the chicken to be uninspired, but I had better luck with my fish. Also, do note that before the main dishes were served, a small basket of bread together with an assortment of spread was delivered. The price for my cod was around 30 bucks I believe, as for the chicken, I can't remember I am afraid.It's all open air, so don't expect air-con or a reprieve from the hot sun should you arrive before night truly descends (AKA evening). You do get a good view of the pool though (the reason why it's called pool grill) which can either be a terrific or uninspired depending on who's swimming
5
my friends and I recently dine in at our local hotel's eatery, the Pool Grill @ marriott hotel Singapore. the wait staff, Tiara did and excellent service by recommending us the dishes and cocktails. the pool grill signature cocktail (mojito) was wonderful. perfect balance of rum, lime and mint. a wonderful palate quencher. she also recommended the boneless beef short rib which was a delight. food and drinks aside server Tiara went the extra mile in explaining the dishes and was quick on her feet whenever we require assistant. I personally would like to applaud her attitude and her constant smile even when we had too much to ask due to my company being fickle on the menu. amazing service by her, amazing food and drinks. couldn't have asked for anything better. good job tiara and good job pool grill
4
Really nice setting. Very relaxing but a bit on the expensive side. I had a steak one night and seafood another. Must say the lobster cocktail that they make in the mason jar is very cool and tasty. You can't beat the backdrop of the city and the inviting pool at night. I would not make a special trip but if you are staying at the Marriott for sure at least stop by for a drink if not dinner.
5
Wow, been all over the place and right where I'm staying is the most awesome meal you can find anywhere! Chef Jeremy puts out the tastiest foods. Mushroom soup, Braised short ribs.... Man
Be back soon!
5
Good Food and quick service. The waiters are not rude, but always attentive to your needs. They would wait until we were out of the water to serve our drinks and came back when they were empty. You could not ask for anymore!
5
Had 4 nights at the Marriott recently and went down here for dinner one night. A lovely setting without having to freeze in over the top air conditioning. Very comfortable eating there alone. Attentive and welcoming staff. Had the snapper fillet with potato scallops and grilled asparagus and a G & T while waiting. Could not fault anything.

late review for a value for money restaurant! amazing caesar's salad made upon your likes from a superb server! the rest of servers i think they need a bit more training! no serving forks and spoons for sharing dishes, no tasting the 2nd bottle of wine ( i guess because it was the same brand name)!!! foie gras good, wagyu beef burger exceptional,king salmon could have been better grilled but this things happens even to the good ones!! overall a nice experience in a nice place! recommended for all occasions

We booked a table for four for dinner, the location is really nice, by the pool with Singapore lights around us.We came for steaks and we did find what we were looking for: my ribeye was cooked at perfection, juicy and tenderA bottle of Italian chianti, overall quite a pricey dinner (abt 130 Sin$ per person) but not much for Singapore Only issue is that service was very slow: more than 1.5 hrs for a relatively simple dinner (and the restaurant was less than half full

On the 22nd Feb my husband and I dined at the Pool Grill for our 40th wedding anniversary. We chose the restaurant as it was close to where we were staying and the menu offer was to our taste after a week of experiencing different cuisines. We were greeted warmly by the staff and were given a table near to the pool. The surroundings were pleasant and as the sun went down and the guests left the pool the ambiance changed to a more romantic setting. Our meals were presented in perfect time, we both enjoyed our selection. My husband mentioned it was an anniversary dinner, the staff responded by serving us a delicious complimentary chocolate cake with candle and 'happy anniversary' written in chocolate for dessert. The service was cheerful and friendly

My friend visited this restaurant frequent and brought me today for late lunch. I was served by Mr Selvam. He was very friendly and welcome with a warm/ sincere greeting. It was very personalised and I could feel his sincerity. He recommended us a few dishes on the menu since it was my first time. That was very thoughtful of him. I had the Chicken breast with corn puree. The meat was grilled very well and juicy. It blend so well with the corn puree. The best meal i ever tasted.I was served by both Joanna and Leonard. Both of them were very professional in serving the meal. I was truly impressed by their service. The restaurant was not crowded at the particular time but they make sure that we feel comfortable.One of the new staff name Carl was very observant. He refill our drinks every time. I commend him for being proactive. Though he was new to his job, he was able to break the ice and make small conversation with us. He will also accommodate to our needs and serve it very fast. Impressive. I enjoyed my conversation with him. His customer service was very excellent.I truly recommend anyone to have their meal at this restaurant. I will definitely come back again with my friends.Thank you Selvam, Leonard, Joannah and Carl for going out the extra mile to take care of your customers and making it a pleasant dining experience for me and my friend

We visited Marriott since it is located at the shopping district in Orchard. The pagoda style of the hotel is really inviting not knowing what could they offer. out of curiosity tried the pool grill restaurant at 5th floor.Upon entering the restaurant we we're greeted by a staff and let us sit and gave the menu. while checking on what they have, the friendly assitant manager Joannah approached us, took time in explaining what they have even with the simple truffle fries with a twist of mushroom something, really taste good. we ordered margherita pizza and buffalo wings which taste just perfect and to complete the meal with tiramisu and choc fondant.thank you for the great comfort provided and 2 thumbs up for the food! good job for the team in pool grill!!!keep it up..

With the exception of the caesar salad, our last week's dinner there were the worst in terms of food I have ever had in a 5* hotel restaurant! The oysters were tasteless and the beefsteak juicy-less.Our wine bottle were left unattended from time to time, though when they saw we served ourselves the waiters apologized with sincere and the overall service attitude was attentively and friendly
5
Excellent dining experience with my friends as the ambience and service were wonderful, we really appreciate Ms. Joannah when she made the ceasar salad while having a good conversation with my friends, we're really impressed with the service provided by the entire pool grill staff. surely we'll comeback with the bunch of wanderlust feet friends
5
really appreciate their services and thoughts. Was celebrating my hubby's bday and they prepare a small piece of bday cake. They looking for a chance and surprised him from his back with the cake. Food was nice, will recommend friends and relatives too

a perfect poolside dinnig place, food and service are excellent. of course you have to pay slightly higher price for all this. weekday will be good as there are less people.

Very pleasant evening. Thank you Tina, thank you all : service and kitchen can suffer no criticism. Only at 5th level but what a view !
5
Decided to go there since there was a 1-for-1 for their set menu through the Entertainer App. Since we chose the set menu the options were limited, but the food was good. Service was awesome, perhaps that might be because we came in early. But even when it got crowded later in the night it was still easy to get the servers' attention. Ambience was definitely the clincher. I think I will come back another time

We checked into the Marriott early this morning after a series of issues with our flight. After some sightseeing, my wife, our travel companions and I decided to stay in the hotel for dinner. We chose the Pool Grill based on its fairly glowing reviews on Trip Advisor, as well as on the recommendation of the concierge in the 27th floor Executive Lounge.We arrived at about 20:15, were seated promptly and given menus, but no one ever came to take a beverage order. After 15-20 minutes, a server stopped to see if we wanted to place a food order. By this time, our female travel companion decided to go back to her room, leaving the remaining three of us to order dinner.Our male travel companion ordered a bowl of gazpacho soup and a heirloom tomato salad, which he ate without comment but seemed to enjoy. My wife also ordered gazpacho, which she pronounced "OK but not great", and a root vegetable salad. I ordered a Caesar salad and the wagyu beef burger medium rare.The Caesar salad was competently prepared tableside and was quite good. Our server asked If there were any flavorings I did not like, and omitted and that I listed. Otherwiset, there were none. The burger was medium , with no pink showing. After the meal, our server followed my wife out of the restaurant. I had to explain to him that I would take care of it. Not sure why.In short the headline is very accurate. Clearly the serving staff needs training and basic polish. The menu was very disappointing, not sure why it is as highly rated as it is on Trip Advisor
5
Carl and Veno are the most wonderful hosts anyone could ask for. The food was fantastic and they made us feel at home while traveling abroad. I recommend this restaurant even for those not staying at the hotel. The atmosphere is equal in excellence to the food. Highly recommended

We had late lunch at Pool grill on Sunday. It was a quiet and cozy dining area next to the pool on level 5 at Marriott hotel. What I like the most abt this place is the atmosphere. I felt like I was invited to my friend's who has a nice pool. :) There were only a couple of other customers in the restaurant and a kid with her father who plays with the water in the pool. It was a perfect place for us, quiet and relaxing. However, the service was uncoordinated. We had to wait for a while to order our food or get a glass of water. Another customer was a bit upset as he had to come to the counter to tell what he needs.The menu is pretty much what you can see from other western restaurants. The quality of food was not too bad. The food wasnt impressive though, I will drop by to grab a cocktail when I come to Orchard and need a escape from the hectic crowd. ;) They make very nice Mojito.

Group lunch for year end. Easy to get bookings when rest of singapore has no bookings or time restrictions and some even want food orders the day before. So pool grill was a welcomed option. Table was facing the pool with great views and warm air. It's not common to eat with such lovely views. Most ordered the set menu lunch. I noticed the portions were smaller but seems aligned to the lower price too. Starters+mains+Dessert+free flow ice tea or warm drinks. For just $30++. However rest of menu is middle to high priced considering it's Orchard and you in a five star hotel and it has great views. Service was great with constant topping up of drinks. Overall food was good. The location and service makes the experience great. I would return for another relaxing afternoon. I'm sure at night it's lovely too.

First time dining here thus came without any expectation. Service was friendly and informal, from the host right to the wait staff. The restaurant was full when we arrive and while walking to our seats, we thought we are in Tokyo. All the diners are Japanese ladies having their leisurely lunch with their toddlers/ babies, ALL. We are odd one out, we felt. The food is awesome, kudos to the Chef. Choose the Braised Beef Rib as main course - the meat melt in the mouth with the right amount of seasoning, though it can be a little less salty, just a little less. Will definitely return, probably for dinner as the alfresco dining environment is not conducive when you are in a suit.........
5
Tucked away in a serene paradise located on the 5th floor of Marriott Hotel Singapore, namely the pool deck, the restaurant is indeed a gem that promises great value, excellent quality & superb view.Had the Set Dinner and its totally worth it at only $48++ per pax for a 3-course meal. Unbelievable value at a luxury hotel and such an upmarket restaurant with a awesome ambience!You can also choose to have the bar setting if you are just chilling for a couple of drinks
5
Great setting for a night out with your girl or guy. Friendly staff and good food choices. If you're staying at the Marriott, bring your swim suit.
4
pool grill restaurant has always been one of our fav dining place! love the relaxing feel, good food & good service !
3
When you pay +$250 for 2 people (just mains) you should expect more. Good location, Good steak, Warm beer and avg service. Over rated..
5
Came here with my husband for date night, the location is a semi outdoor environment which is beside the swimming pool. Great for chilling out. I had tenderloin medium rare which is one of best I've tasted in Singapore, and I have been to many steak places. It's a little small for guys to eat, but it's just nice for ladies who just want to have a main and some desserts later. My husband ordered the sirloin steak medium rare which is as good, more taste than tenderloin but not as tender.
5
Living in Singapore since many years, this is our "hidden gem" for a relaxedand sophisticated lunch. At the poolside, though sheltered from the occasional rain showers, and surprisingly quiet in the midst of the city.The 3-course set lunch with ample choices provides an exquisite sample of French cuisine.Free flow of soft drinks and coffee.Efficient service with a smile. TOP!!
5
It was our first visit to the Pool Grill on 25 Oct 2014.I had a wonderful dinner with my son, Elroy. We both have had a Lovely, relaxing evening by the atmosphere, extremely friendly staff; they have impressed us by the level of service that they had extended to us. I shall said not only us, to all their guests.Thank you to Ms Misty and Mr Chan, both of you had made our visits so special. Thank you again!The friendliness, efficiency and professional service that have make this place a delighted venue to visit We will definitely be visiting Pool Grill again.All the success to Pool Grill and Staff to keep up with your good works. Cheers!Lindy Lu

When caught in a sudden rainstorm recently on Orchard Road,I remembered this place from favourable reviews on TripAdvisor.I took the steak 3 course menu$36).The steak a la carte items seemed very expensive to an Australian,but I later found this seemed to be Singapore wide.The meal was very good,and the steak was smal but tasty.The starter was cod croquettes and the dessert was good..Draft Carlsburg,a pile of newspapers and an OK selection of wines by the glass helped pass the little time allowed by the excellent service
5
This has been the second time dining at Pool Grill at the Marriott Singapore and it has once again impressed me with the food and warm service.Introduced by a close friend as a venue for a celebration, I was impressed by the level of service extended to us. From the table service to the detailed explanation of the ingredients for their amazing Caesar Salad done table side, the service was excellent all round (and consistant for both visits).Kudo's to Pool Grill's Assistant Restaurant Manager, Joannah Singina and her team for making our visits special and out of this world, I look forward to dining here in the near future.Cheers

Had lunch in the pool grill with a friend. The atmosphere was very nice as the title says being situated on Orchard road it was quiet and peaceful to enjoy a spot of lunch. The food was nice there was a choice between Al a Carte and a set menu at $30 which was reasonable for three courses. The food was good (the chef Sean) even came out to speak to us at the table to find out how the meal was. The service is in the grill area was excellent, included in the set menu was free flow ice tea, which our server "Edna" I think ensured that we never went thirsty and didn't have to wait for a drink. The presentation of the food was excellent and tasted great.Thank you for a wonderful experience
5
Had dinner with my bf 1st time at The pool grill.It was pretty nice atmosphere, nice food and great service.All the staff were very nice and made us satisfied for our dinner.The food was reall good looking and the taste was wonderful so that the price is reasonable.Appeciate all of u guys from The Pool Grill.

Had dinner with my wife and we were seated facing the pool. Location was superb and romantic, food was great and service was really excellent.
4
I liked to try steak food and red wine. Overall quality was very good. Maybe should try desert also.
5
A great selection of grills including sea food , the food was excellent in a great romantic setting , very good service , wine is expensive in singapore .
5
Excellent food quality and great ambiance. The service was great, friendly and fast.
I would definitely return :)

Great ambience and a relaxing lunch by the poolside grill at the Marriott Hotel Singapore.
We had lamb shanks, pork ribs and their signature caesar's salad tossed by Joanne :-)
5
We dine in Marriott Cafe last July and we had a wonderful dinner with my wife and friends. First, the service was amazing.. Second they have a lot of selection on the buffet like seafood, pasta, steak, cheeses etc.. Chef and staff are very friendly and welcoming..I will definitely go back to that restaurant and recommend to my friends

We stayed at the Marriott and decided to have dinner at the pool grill. Reservations were made in advance,which was a good decision as the place filled up quickly after 6:30.We had Caesar's Salad with Chicken / Salmon, which was prepared at the table by Joanne.She is a very lovely person who prepared a very good dressing from scratch while being able to entertain us with a pleasant conversation at the same time.Dessert was Creme Brûlée and Bread Pudding with a Whisky Sauce, both very tasty.The setting is very nice at the pool, surprisingly quiet considering the location of the hotel
5
We visited on a weekday evening for dinner, as the seating is only alfresco, it wad a little warm. The 3 of us ordered Caesar salad with prawns (yummy!), scallops and lobster bisque as starters, followed by mains of yellow fin tuna, pork cutlets, and rib eye. The fish and pork were faultless, but the rib eye was a tad too mediocre. However our server Joannah was wonderful and attentive, and overall the experience was lovely!
4
I visited pool grill for lunch with my bf and another couple a few days ago and had a lovely experience. The staff was attentive and friendly and provided us with great service. I had the salmon and it was delicious. The reason im not rating it 5 stars is because i made it clear to the server that i was allergic to peanuts, and a few minutes later a different server came out with a dish of peanuts. They apologized and promptly took it away and everything was great after that. Will retur

There are plenty of restaurants in Singapore, this is one which I truly experience a wholesome dining experience.From the phone call till we left the restaurant, it was near flawless. i was met with enthusiasm on the phone, ushered to our table with rare genuine and gentle smiles.Menu was adequately explained by a young lady, orders were taken with certainty with few good questions (it means the server knows her job),Ambience at the pool side, with well-lit Ion behind the pool, good crowd in the restaurant, no loud conversations, surrounded by beautiful people (well mannered, and dressed, of course, look as well).Food was very well laid on the plates, grilled chicken that we had was nicely done, the barramundi fish was very neat asparagus and potatoes were in its respective metal pots to perverse its heat.The server apologized very gently when there was a slight delay in one of my request.My review:Food – 7/10 (barramundi and grilled chicken)Service – 9/10 (rare places with such excellent servers in Singapore, good F&B management)Ambience – 6/10 (nice crowd helps)Bill – normalCongratulations to the team of the restaurant

Good food and service. Definitely "a must try".
Thanks to Joanna

See you again

Had wonderful time with my mum for dinner. Nice and relax environments. Special thanks to Joanna and the service team. Keep it up to wonderful service and smile 😊

Husband and I had a great dinner at Pool Grill. The Food is fantastic and the table side Caesar salad made by Anthony was a nice touch. Amazing cuts of beef, that are very reasonably priced and must be the cheapest Wagyu in town.
5
We decided we needed an evening out in our home town of Singapore and my wife hit upon the idea of eating here.Wonderfully relaxing atmosphere, extremely friendly staff who could not do enough for us; and the food was cooked and presented really well.But again, the restaurant feels such a relaxing place to be - its outside and undercover with no aircon though with ceiling fans which were more than adequate; looking over the pool and the rooftops at night you can just unwind so easily.The friendly, efficient, unassuming and professional service make this place a delight to visit and we shall be back
4
Great food and Great Service though it might be a bit warm at times. I had the lamb rack while my wife had the beef burger with foie gras. Everything was cooked to perfection. The service was excellent especially Selvam the service associate. Though prices are not cheap compared to other restaurants and with no air-con, the food and service makes up for it. Will definitely come back again especially with the Palate promotion
4
Greeted by an incredibly polite and professional waitress. Food arrived within a reasonable time, and tasted brilliant. We had the scallops, cod fish, lamb cutlets, sautéed mushrooms and creamy spinach. All the dishes were as delicious as promised. Lamb was beautifully seasoned, and cod was cooked just so. My only complaint - and I'm stretching a little - is that the scallops were a little rubbery. Perhaps not the freshest batch?Had 50% off with the Palate card, great value
5
Stayed at the Marriott with my family in late June, and had lunch/dinner at the Pool Grill several times in addition to drinks/ice cream/snacks at various times. The staff was amazing the whole time; took care of our kids and served us with the most genuine smiles in Singapore! The menu is small but full of good dishes. TIP: remember to ask for the pool menu in addition to the regular one if you have trouble finding something tempting. I have stayed here a lot the last 3 years so I´m a bit spoilt, but this was certainly a high point. The only problem: now my family won´t pity me for being on the road any longer: they thought this was PERFECT
5
I normally dropped by Pool Grill for lunch because of its location. The restaurant though small but their selections of menu are impressive. I had duck breast most of the time but yesterday it was the first time I tried the lamb chop with red wine sauce. Besides the big portion (you really can't expect this in Singapore with the price you pay), the meat was perfectly cooked, the texture is soft and tender. Moreover, the staff was very attentive, they would keep checking if you need anything or how the foods is. I noticed that the restaurant is getting busier during the lunch time (compared with my last visit), so booking is advised if you want to check this place out. Hint: zipping lychee iced tea by the pool is also a must-do when you visit this restaurant
4
It has been a two year hiatus since I last dined here. The ambience is still good and it makes one feel relaxed. We had the Caesar salad and lobster bisque which were quite good. However my favorite would be the grilled wagyu sirloin which was perfectly executed to medium wellness. Together with a glass of Pinot noir it was nothing short of excellence. We also love the complimentary bread served and the accompanying condiments. Not forgetting the friendly service rendered, the experience is even better than 2 yrs ago.
5
Wife and I had dinner here. Had lobster bisque and tuna carpaccio entrees, and then lamb rack and barramundi mains. Everything was cooked to perfection and very tasty. Portion size was good/not stingy. Service very friendly and speed of service was fine. Drinks (watermelon and ginger beer) came in big glasses, watermelon had no ice so warmed up quick. Alcohol is hideously expensive here, I.e. 20SGD for a draft beer (one for one deal) or 60SGD for bottle of house wine. This is not a cheap restaurant but as we had spent $800 or more at Tangs shopping centre (which is directly next to the marriott) we had a $100 gift voucher, so all in all cost is 70SGD. Did not try dessert here, but they were about 15SGD on average. They did look tasty, but I would recommend going down to the front foyer and ordering a delicious cake from the bar, plenty to choose from and cheaper than the pool grill. Would recommend this place to friends. Nice ambience for sure. Candlelights at all tables for the romantics out there
5
value for $$ and most important the food and service was excellence We'll definitely back again!
Thank you for the good service:)
5
It was our first time to visit this restaurant during lunch time. i just want to drop you all a short note to express our dearest gratitude and sincere thanks to Selvam, Sunny, Pratik. Excellent food is never without an excellent service. I am very pleased to share with you that you have a veryy good staff who really takes care their guest and talk with us. Will definitely come back to this restaurant and bring along our friends. Well done guys. Will see yah all again. Keep it up the good work
5
I just have to say that the food and the service at the pool grill in the Marriott Singapore, was nothing short of spectacular. The ambience, was perfect. The staff were professional. They delivered service that in my opinion is lacking in many places.What an evening! I'm looking to returning agai
5
The Sunday brunch here is just delicious! All the brunchy type food you'd expect - including an all day lazy breakfast! The omelettes are the best I've ever had! Plus you can order a la carte if you so wish and there's free flow available if you want. Ambience is great and service is pretty good too. This was our second visit within a month and we might make it a regular affair it's such a great time
5
Stumble upon this restaurant a while back and managed to dine in there in March, service wise, friendly and fast, I was recommended to try their caesar salad, which was make at the table (not dress at the kitchen). Wagyu Burger- well made. I am vert tempted to be back again just for the caesar sala
4
If you are staying in the Marriott hotel for a reasonable length and don't always want to go out to dine, this restaurant is a good choice as there is enough choice not to make you feel tired of the cuisine and the pricing is very reasonable. There is a well priced chef 3 course menu with ample coice for each course and a good a la carte choice. Wine selection is relatively limited, but then you don't necessarily dine here for the wine. Sitting outside gets you out of the artificial air con environment and partial glimpses of some of the Singapore skyline is an added bonus. Service is always with a smile and lots of good attention from the staff. Marriott staff are known for their friendliness and are generally efficient to boot. I dined here on a number of occasions and would certainly go back again

You would think that if the first thing you do when you arrive at the table is order a bottle of Bollinger, then the staff may just look after you. In this case, it was pretty much the opposite. The pool setting is lovely and relaxing (if you get a table actually near the pool) and the menu is very promising. But when you're paying $20 for an entree and $60 - $70 for a main, you would expect the service to be first class. We were dining with a friend that was out in Singapore for a week from the UK and were appalled and embarrassed at the terrible service we received. Especially as our friend was paying for the meal as a wedding present. It must have taken 45 minutes for them to take our food order! And even though the restaurant is pretty small and there weren't that many customers, we had to try and get their attention for absolutely everything. It was pretty bad, but even worse when my husband - who had ordered off the set dinner menu while myself and our guest had ordered off the alacarte menu - was bought out his dessert when we were only just finishing our main! He asked for it to be sent back so he could have it once myself and my friend had ordered our own desserts. It was so bizarre they had bought it out so early let alone the shock at being asked to bring it out later, at the same time as everyone else's desserts! Not such an outrageous request surely?! We think this must have annoyed the waitress, as she was chatting to her workmate at the bar later when we tried to get her attention to bring us the wine menu (as we had run out) she clearly rolled her eyes at her workmate before dragging herself over to our table to serve us. Absolutely appalling! The bill came to $600 for the 3 of us. While the food was fine, the service was so incredibly terrible that we will not be back
4
Dinner here was fine the other night. Food was good, service OK. Nothing to rave about, but also nothing to complain about. We arrived without a reservation, so had to sit at the back, and didn't get the full "pool view" experience, but that was our fault. Wines were expensive
4
We had a wonderful relaxed lunch at the poolside restaurant. We started with the lobster bisque followed by grilled fish with salad and asparagus on the side. All the items were great, served hot and fresh. The service is friendly and efficient.Altogether a lovely place to relax on a Sunday afternoon

Let’s go swimming…The intrepid Travelling Gourmet goes on a food-ful visit to a pretty pool to taste…Story By Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling GourmetMARRIOTT Singapore’s delectable treats served by the Balinese style swimming pool on level 5, 92m above above Orchard Road. The ambience is simple, understated yet peaceful and romantic. Around the pool are the exclusive suites like the premium Tang Sor Kiar suite, the location for my RazorTV cooking show for Razor TV. Creative Chef de Cuisine, John Chye, specializes in good food with a 21st Century twist.Watermelon GoodieDistracted by frolicking bikini clad beauties, I was pleasantly surprised by a rectangle of red watermelon topped by Chorizo sausage. The aroma of basil and fennel enticed as Chef John explained humbly, “You get the sweetness of the water melon, crunch of pistachio plus the savoury kick of the Chorizo. It’s not on the menu.” Next was hand sliced wafer thin Salmon Carpaccio drizzled with extra virgin olive oil, frsh lemon juice, shaved fennel and sweetness from the tomato. Wine Spectator AwardWine Spectator has honoured the Pool Grill for having on of the most outstanding wine lists in the world so try Spanish La Rioja Alta Vina Arana Rioja Reserva 1998 or Argentinian Terrazas de Los Andes Reserva Malbec 2007 with Beef & Foie Gras, both done to perfection…just rare in the middle, caressed with Burgundy red wine sauce! Yum! Yum! The Barramundi fish is excellent too. A volcano of peppery aromatic Arugula covers it while the tomato coulis with white wine and basil flavours the fish so well. A glass of Krug Grande Cuvee Brut is super-duper with the Barramundi. I am also partial to the healthy Salmon spiked with fennel and Parmigiano, dressed with velvety garlic aioli sauce.Sweeties, darling!John’s Pavlova named after that famous prima ballerina has a suprising liquid gooey creamy center (I can’t tell you the secret recipe he shared :-)) and a variety of fruits like kiwi, raspberry and blueberry on top so you taste different flavours depending which side you start with. Ingenious. J’taime Bananas Foster Crepe a la New Orleans will thrill your eager tastebuds.Marriott’s consistently good brand explains why I like to stay in Marriotts around the world. Come to this peaceful oasis to relish good food and wines and savour the True 1944 Mai Tai mixed with Bacardi Oro, Mount Gay Rum, Curacao de Orange and Angostura Bitters...heavenly!

Small selection, easy access next to pool in hotel, and away from the chaos of the buffet. Wish they had more to select from, but food was great!

Fantastic value for lunch overlooking the Marriott pool. Good to try the specials and enjoy happy hour!
4
Lunch was good.
Good value at only 30 SGC for course menu.
Complimentary bread and coffee tea.
Nice atmosphere.
Would recommend for lunch.
Dessert was also good
4
Good food, easy to eat poolside, kids liked it too!
A little pricey for the type of food but beats having to pack up the kids and leave the pool for lunch!
4
Ambience-it's pretty chill to have dinner here except for the noise from a private party near the restauran as it gets later the crowd from party gets rowdy.Food-lobster bisque was good but not fantastic. As a steak lover, had been to Mortons, Wooloomooloo etc but here the ribeye was so good it's grill to the correct done-ness with hint of char ... Dessert-cant remember the name but attached the pic. This is heavenly and a must try.Overall-definately will return for steak n dessert!! It's worth every dollar!
4
We went for lunch, and drinks. The service there is very good, not as busy as crossroads, so they make you feel very welcome and relaxed.The food is very good, and the view with the Ion and Orchad RD is great at sunset.P.s. make use of the happy hour/free flo

Went to Pool Grill for BBQ Buffet $75 SG inclusive of free-flow wines and cocktail of the day. I myself dont drink alcohol so the staff offered some soft drinks. I liked lamb and beef the most but there are many more offered like chicken, sausages, seafood. Salad bar, cold cuts, but at first I didnt see dessert line. I loved pumpkin gratin. Service was friendly and helpful. Staff were standing by and helping with food delivery and drink service. Especially Sarina, Hans and Paresh, very helpful! The weather was a bit hot and humid but slow wind blow and the lights from ion made us staring at changing led lights. Wish I could swim! But its reserved for only hotel guests. Dessert was a big surprise. I like the bowl with strawberries, sweet whipped cream and merang. I finished 2 rounds for this! Such a happy ending.Will go back there soon! Wish I can still have the BBQ again. Not sure if its still there
5
We had a really lovely meal here on our first night. A small but intimate restaurant overlooking the pool and part of the Singapore skyline. Great food and service provided by Anthony and his team. I told him that I would mention him on Trip Advisor and here it is. He prepares your Cesar Salad at the side of your table and tells you what each ingredient is. The result was awesome. I am only sorry that more people were not there to enjoy the ambience and the food
4
Although there was a little bit miscommunication on our reservation, we don't want to complain after a wonderful dinner. Dining by the poolside with a very few table next to us, with the butler service to make your delicious Caesar Salad, it had win our heart.

The Pool Grill has something of a resort feeling in the middle of Orchard Road. It is not an astonishing place but quite ok for a burger or salad lunch while shopping. While soaking up the poolside atmosphere, you will quickly forget that you are in one of the most densely populated metropolitan areas of the world.On the downside, wines are seriously overpriced and youâ€™ll struggle to find much under SGD 100 including tax and service
