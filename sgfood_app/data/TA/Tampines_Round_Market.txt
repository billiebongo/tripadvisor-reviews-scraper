It's a typical and probably one of the best and oldest Neighbourhood market in Singapore. You can get everything with lots of local businesses these at reasonable prices. There is a foodcourt and Al Azhar also there.
Almost all kind of shops ATMs etc there.

There will be a flea market like once a month
Great food like Nasi Lemak, Nasi Sambal Goreng, Nasi Ambeng and many more at affordable prices and delicious too and not to forget scrumptious servings

One of the more convenient and better places for lunch in Tampines. Many good food choices around. Today I eat the Armenian Street char kway teow. Good. But today the cockles is a bit small. Will also recommend.

One of my favorite lunch places. Affordable and good local hawker dishes like lor mee, pork rib noodles, Sarawak noodles and many more.

Went here to buy some bike accessories. Great place to eat as there are many hawker stalls and many varieties. Great place to experience a local neighbourhood culture for tourists.

This is a typical Hawker Center. If you are staying at the east and would like to try a variety of food, do give this place a visit. They have porridge, noodles, rice, and drink stalls. They also have those fritters and finger foods stalls. My only gripe about this place is their hygiene and the many birds preying on the food. So do not leave your food unattended, it might get stolen

I had been staying around this area during my school days. Came back during one of the lunch time. Thought that most of the long queues of food stall will be nice but not so. I had the mee that's sells the braised chicken feet/ chicken wings/ ribs noodles. It's just average like of food stall. My friend had the famous lor mee. The taste of the soup doesn't have the lor mee flavors much. But there are lots of varieties. If you are looking for some authentic food, and varieties. This is the place for you.

It's a wet market in Tampines and they sell a lot of fresh produce. However, what constantly brings me here is the food. This place is a good place to get breakfast especially food like fried bee hoon, bah chor mee, wanton mee etc. They close for dinner except some stalls like the zichar and the fish head steamboat.

The Teo Kee Bak Chor Mee always has a long queue and get sold out early by noon, but I think it is over-rated! The texture of the dry noodle was ok but the whole disk lack any taste, have to pour the whole sauce plate of green chilli and vinegar to it to add some flavour. Also the livers and pork slices were overcooked and tough. The braised chicken feets also not soft enough for the bones to be chewed upon. Certainly there are many other better bak chor mee around especially in the eastern district in Singapore
