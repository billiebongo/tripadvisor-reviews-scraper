Great bar, friendly staff, good food. Happy hour before 9pm so great prices. Easy the best bar in Holland Village.
5
the weekday bands here are pretty chill, with some affordable happy hour beer promotions ($13 pints), a nice place to just zone out / unwind with friends or alone.
3
Food is the same as is the place but lacking atmosphere and does not seem as popular as before. Band upstairs a bit hit and miss
4
Nice venue to have drinks if you are around Holland Village area. Quite a big space, suitable for gig groups too. They have live music on the 1st floor.
5
this place has been open for a very long time, since 2 decades ago? always a good place to listen to good live bands, and enjoy a beer w friends.
4
Good food and drinks offered. Popular place so get in before 7 to get a seat (maybe earlier). Western style food and IPads to order
Service can be a little slow when really busy
3
The outlet is located at the fsmous Holland Village where are many restaurants, cafes, pubs, etc, for whoever is intetested in their products.The whole place is closed to vehicles so that it allows more tables to be placed outside to serve more customers. There is also a circle line mrt station at the road junction.The outlet is quite big with many tables on the ground floor and second floor. There is band on second floor as well for customer who like to drink and enjoy the music.The ambience is not bad
4
We came here on a Sunday night to watch the final round of the Open Golf. Good venue for a low key drink, sit back and watch some sport (3 tvs with different sport on). iPads on each table so you can order your own drinks - liked this a lot and they came very quick. No need to get up and wait at the bar

If u in singapore and visit holland village u must try this bar. There is a few option of bar here. I tried this one...they hv so many kinds of beer. U can just enjoy ur alcohol..soft drink or other else at downstair...watching futball game from the tv screen or u can go second floor coz they have life band. I was there with rock music live band...very nice experience. And dont worry...they price not too expensive...its almost same price with other place in Singapore...

This place feel like home where is located at holland village with super friendly staff (Mr. Maniam, Zain, Hafiz, Amit, Martin, Kenny, James, Cin Hau, Jesfry, Aaron, June, Maria, Hebrew), live music with amazing shirlyn&theunexpected band every Thursday&Saturday and Tabula band for every Tuesday. The food and drink also great with reasonable reason (my recommendation: original chicken wings)
4
This is a great place to visit, located at Holland Village. The food and drink were great, and there is a whole street of eateries for all tastes.
5
Try to get a seat outside if it is not raining, it is a bit noisy under the roof. The choice of beers is good and the food is consistent- chicken wings and grilled squid are the pick.
5
Great location for live rock n roll music. Reasonably priced drinks. Food is pub food. Come here for the live music in upstairs room that starts at 9:45.
4
I visited here a few times also, very popular bar with some good bands at the weekend. I wouldn't stay here all night and worth dropping in for a beer (or two)
5
By far the best bar in HV. The staff are amazing, remembering us every time we went in (which was a lot!!!). The food is great especially the pizza. If you like hot food, the hot wings are mega hot!

I just arrived from London. I was hungry. Ordered coke, fries, sausages around S$30. Was pestered 3 times in 5 minutes to leave a credit card for a tab. The food cane over, I had a mouthful, and again he came over. I got so fed up, I asked the waiter "do you want me to leave my table to go over to the bar to pay by card, or can you wait until I've finished my meal", he wouldn't budge. I left the hot food to go over to the bar to pay, it took 3 minutes. Coming back to the table I felt like I had been treated badly. It spoiled my experience of this place. I spoke to the manager Mr Manyam,nothing happened. No apology from the pestering waiter. Make up your mind
4
We arrived and chose to sit at a tall table at the front of the establishment. Shortly thereafter a waitress arrived and plugged our table into a IPAD. It was plain sailing after that, we could order our drinks on the IPAD, and they turned up very quickly! We had quite a lot then we settled up and off we went, it's a lot better than queuing at the bar!Big TV screens. Nice sports bar, no parking close here
4
Had a few drinks with friends. Typical bar food for the most part. We enjoyed the Wala Wala burger with fries. You're supposed to order using an iPad but looks like just about everything is confirmed by a waiter. Service is pretty good overall. I would return to this restaurant.
5
I love catching gigs like Jack & Rai & especially Shirlyn & The UnXpected here! Wala Wala has always been known for their stellar bands. The drink selections is quite wide and the food is pretty good. Service is friendly & high-tech -- they have iPads for ordering food & drinks!
4
Nothing much can be said about the same generic drinks or happy hour which can be found roughly everywhere at Holland V. However what is good is that the service staff there is quite friendly which makes ordering drinks and food quite easy. The second floor also has live bands performing Everyday and the quality of the bands are quite good. Wednesday night was a band called Lost Box which gave us some great quality indie songs.However the music volume could be decrease abit as even sitting at the back, the music was loud to the extend that my ears throb.
5
Love to come hear. Food and music was superb! staff are very friendly and restaurants very clean. Worth for value!
5
Have been here a few times now, whenever we visit Singapore. Always full of locals, has a great vibe and music every evening makes it a great place to hang out.
4
Holland Village is a must visit after office hrs where you hangout to drink and enjoy music. Wala serves decent food and drinks and the band is quite awesome too.
5
We have a fabulous night, thanks to staff who were quick, efficient and fun! But the band that plays on. Saturday night made the evening - they were brilliant! The pizzas were okay - nothing to rave about, the menu has loads of other options!
4
Live Music, EPL, Rugby and a great beer selection. Wala Wala is a great place to hang out with friends and have some cold beers. Service is fast and nowadays iPad based. A good selection of bar food makes this place a solid place to hang out with your mates. When the road is closed at night time it has a certain holiday feeling.
4
Slightly out of the main town, we went to Wala Wala in Holland Village on a Saturday night to watch the band Shirelle & The UnXpected. They were quite good and made for a good night. Bar staff were friendly and food was good. Not the cheapest night out but we live in Dubai so not unused to paying a lot for drinks. Very busy place full of locals with the odd expat. Everyone very friendly and was a really good night out.
4
We celebrated our girlfriend's birthday here with affordable drinks and the service crew were really helpful to get us a good comfortable spot! It was a fabulous night out for a good catch up. The upstairs had live band playing but unfortunately we did not manage to get seats there.. It was really crowded so I assume they had great music!
4
Been here many times and visited again on trip back to Singapore. Headlines as a Pizza place but large selection of food and drinksGood ambience with covered and outside seating.Free Wifi and shows all sportFood is good and you order with the IPad at your table. This is a great idea but 1 IPad per table is not enough as only one person can see the menuAs always in here staff are average and not particularly friendl
5
Great place to relax after a hard day's work. We visited Wala Wala on a Friday evening after work with few colleagues. As expected, the place was crowded but we were given a table within 10-15mins of wait. Ambiance is nice. Music is not too loud and staff is friendly
5
Love this place for live music and chilled out vibe. Even though it's popular and crowded the people are relaxed and everyone seems to always be in a good mood. The live music upstairs is fantastic. Great singers and the crowd loves it. Drinks are good enough and the food is ok too - chicken wings are pretty delicious. But I mainly come here for the bands. excellent on a Sunday night with friends.
3
The service was pretty good, the waiters are quick and efficient. The food & drinks are average. The atmosphere was pretty good with the live band but it got a bit too noisy after a while.
4
It has been around for a while but still one of my favourite hangout. It has great live musics and drinks are affordable and reasonable priced.
3
It's a bar and they serve good comfort food. Chicken wings, truffle fries, the usual. Upstairs they have a live band. Won't be able to chit chat as it gets so loud. Downstairs for chatting. Always crowded towards Friday and weekends.
5
Great live music, friendly staff, very good food - the ultimate chill-out experience. the bands really are top shelf.
3
Been here several times to watch my favourite football team play live on TV. Good selection of beers and I usually have small bar food snacks which are OK.
4
They have different genres of live music daily. Food is pretty good, more to bar food kinds. The happy hour is pretty good deal, saving a few bucks per beer. Quite a variety of beers too.
4
Friday evenings in Holland Village are always popular with locals and expats. It's a central location for good food and drinks. We decided on Wala Wala as it had a more inviting frontage. Wide open spaces outside and not too busy when we got there. We were seen to promptly by friendly wait staff, got a table quickly and were shown an iPad where we could order our drinks and food from. Very cool:). Drinks arrived soon after order was placed and food not long after. Food quality was good. Overall a very pleasant evening albeit on a hot and humid Singapore evening

When you are served within minutes of placing the order, in spite of a full house, you know that the place is run well. If you are in Holland Village and looking for a nice place to drink, I highly recommend Wala Wala. I've not tried much of their food and frankly the place is an out and out bistro/bar - if you are shooting for food - there are so many other options around. Wala Wala has an extensive drinks menu and their happy hour promotions that extend till 9PM is pretty good. Being a beer aficionado, I love their beer menu, especially the Belgian beers in offing. I really like the open-to-outside setting of the place, which brings the "outside in" as an architect would have put it! The place is normally bustling and full. I've found myself going back to Wala Wala whenever I am in Holland Village area - it's a place that should not disappoint you if you are out for couple of drinks! Cheers to that

This is my fav bar in Singapore for a simple reason - the live band. Shirley & the unXpected is the best I've heard so far in Singapore. Head there on a Thurs or Sat and they sing from Queen, Lep Zeppelin, Radiohead to Adele. The crowd can get crazy at times but it's all for the right reasons. If you like rock music, there's no reason not to like Wala. I'm sure the Wala signature wings go well with the music.
4
I walked into these places for drinks without knowing they have a great live band... the reason was there was no sign board saying live band on the 1st floor ;)...They should put up a sign...I know the place is crowded but people who are new will not have an idea!Anyways the Saturday band plays rock music.... the drummer is brilliant...the lead singer is also good and liked even the rest of the Band. Do go there grab a drink and enjoy the live music...I will be going back in Dec ... :
4
I love the jalapeno poppers and lychee martini here!
Has a decent selection for snacking and a very big drinks menu.
Its a large space with in-door and outdoor seating but can get quite busy on friday evenings. I quite enjoy the open air seating.
4
This is a busy bar in the middle of the Holland Road bar strip, they have good happy hour deals, it gets packed with a good mix of locals and expats.
5
The food is so delicious, for drink tiger beer is the best. Best visit at saturday night, they have live music at 2nd floor.
4
Ideal place for a few beers and people watching..Located in Holland village next to all the restaurants, so this can be a good place to hang around before or after a meal ..the good prices on alcohol make it even more compelling !
4
We went for happy hour prior to our meal . The service was friendly and good. They have a good range of beers. Nice little cafe on busy strip. Good place to people watch
4
Our group of 18-20 people was looking for a decent place for a quick drink for a team outing. We had visited other places in Holland village in the past. This time we decided to try Wala Wala. First thing which was quite good was the menu on an iPad app. Nice & easy to browse through different categories and choose your options. No need to ask waiter to take the notes. They have good collection of beers & spirits from different parts of the world. The service was decent. We tried few snacks. The Jalapeno's stuffed with cheese were quite good. We also tried the cheese platter. Overall our group had quite a good time over the drink. I would definitely visit the place in future. For the simplicity of choosing the items for order using the ipad app I will give very good for the service :
4
Visited this Bar/Restaurant with a couple of friends. Liked the Happy Hour for all alcoholic drinks until 9pm and the very good live music on the first floor (I was there on a Tuesday) the place was packed. Food, I had Wings, my friends some Pasta, was pretty bad. I would recommend eating in one of the other nice restaurants or the close by food court and go there for a beer and the music afterwards. Probably would give one of the other bars a try next time around Holland Village.
5
The staff are friendly, professional and easy going, food is always good and the beers are cripsy cold. If you want a great place to people watch and kick back Wala Wala is the best in the V. I am going back for sure.I love this place and highly recommend you check it out.Mark

We know this place since at least 15 years and it’s still a very good choice for one or more beers together with chicken wings or other finger food.As they’ve a large selection of different beers it’s always easy to find something for everyone. We’ve been there with our kids even when they were very young. The street in front of the café is closed from traffic at around 6 pm and the kids can safely run around while you enjoy your drink. All in all a very good place to chill out and rela

Walla Walla in Holland Village, is an ideal location for an informal after work gathering and sometimes a meal. We recently went after some months and were pleasantly surprised to see that they had change their beer on tap line up to include one of my all time favorites - Fuller's London Pride (and I'm not even English). The French Fries and Chicken wings are both excellent snack foods and their burgers are great. A good place to stop off for a beer on the way home from work
4
Nice atmosphere and great place to chill out with friends or loved ones! Friendly staffs and good service! To try their wings and fries are a must! pork nuggets taste good too but abit on the oily side.
4
Place Is NicE And Relaxing. HAd Wide Choice Of Food Options To Meet This Family Of Five. PriCing Is Average For Singapore Expat Places.
We Will Go Back
4
Enjoys the happy hour promo and delicious chicken wings. I prefers the 2nd floor where you get to enjoy singing from the band. And service was great;!
4
2nd floor you have live band playing everything from James Brown to AC/DC, so you cannot really ask for more in terms of good live music!? Place is jamming and the service is quite good. If you are looking for a good live music bar in Singapore this is probably a very good choice for you
5
I come to this place a lot as I live close by, and I have to say its my favorite in Holland Village. The alcohol selection is very good - and the snacks are pleasantly delightful (walapenos - fried jalapeno peppers with cheese). They show football matches as well at night, and have a live band playing on some nights in the upstairs section. It's always crowded but somehow there's always a couple tables free which is great. I would definitely recommend
4
We arrived 2 minute before they closed the kitchen, however the waiter still welcoming us very friendly and give us some good recommendation on food selection, even though we come late the salad & pizza still deliciously fresh and they even gave us extra bread for it.The rest of the meal and beer we ordered are enjoyable and we highly value this restaurant for they great service attitude since we drive around for more than 1 hours just to find a decent late dinner :
3
We went with friends who live in Singapore and some friends from Australia also joined us. Good selection of beer/ciders but wine selection average. The food was mainly deep fried, fatty junk food. I ordered a pepperoni pizza - mainly because this is a no no in Malaysia where I live. Unfortunately I was up until 2:30am throwing up and I am positive it was the pizza not agreeing with me. In Asia pizzas always have far too much cheese and it made my stomach turn. I'd go again for a drink but I wouldn't eat there

When in Singapore you're fed up hearing always the same live music (however outstandingly played), maybe you'll do as I did: go on Internet and look for "your" favorite music.I stumbled into Wala Wala this way, and it was a very lucky stumbling. :-)I especially like Thursdays and Saturdays with Shyrlyn, a tiny lady made of 100% energy, beautiful girl and a great voice, accompanied by a very worthy group (drums and Thursday guitar not to be missed)The barman know his job very well, there's a wide selection of beers and spirits, all personnel is really kind and patient when you communicate gesturing because of the music ... Prices are reasonable, also food is good....just Beware of stools!!!Ps: this is about the upstairs bar, I can't say anything about the restaurant downstairs, never trie

Went there for drinks with some friends after work and myself and another girl ordered the frozen mango margarita but when they came we were disappointed as we couldn't taste any alcohol. We mentioned this to our server who told us that he couldn't change it. We told him we didn't want it changed just some alcohol added. But he insisted that he watched the barman make it and there was alcohol in it. After much complaining on our part and even asking him to taste it he took it away and came back later saying that if we were unhappy with it there is nothing more he could do. Granted this time there was a faint taste of alcohol but the point is that the customer service in this place was not up to scratch. Also when we got the bill we had been overcharged for all the cocktails that we ordered and had to get the bill amended. So all in all a bad experience, service was disappointing and the overcharging unwarranted. Shan't be going back there again

Wala Wala has all the ingredients for success: a great location ...the corner position is simply unbeatable; great staff ....the very fact that they have a very high staff retention rate speaks for the management style; a wide selection of drinks; different concepts on different floor levels - on the groundfloor you have the indoor and the outdoor areas, and upstairs you have life music; good pub food - the Wala pizza is legendary !Since they opened up it has been a continuous success story ..the atmosphere is great, you have a mixture of locals and expats, as a woman you can go there alone and you are safe; it certainly is not a pick-up joint, it is a true pub/bar , a typical local neighbourhood joint, with people from all walks of life . its been my regular drinking hole for many many year
