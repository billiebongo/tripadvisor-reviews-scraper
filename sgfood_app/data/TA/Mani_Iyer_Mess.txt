Located at Interesting place - between Little India and Farrer Park MRTs.... quiet place. Handful of menu options and well made and cooked. Tasty but not too spicy. Slow service and canâ€™t handle large crowd. Worth trying but not extra ordinary South Indian food

I have lunch and dinner in this place few times now. The South Indian thali is value for money. The variety rice available is also great. My favourite is the Adai Aviyal which is served on Saturdays for dinner.

We were walking down the main Little India road, where we decided to take a walk in a small road. We found this oasis, on that small lane :) :) The food was mouth watering may be because we were without good food for 2 days.The Adai served was exactly the same we would get in Tamil Nadu :) :) We had their dosa, Idli. We also had their lunch the next day. I would say, the best served meal. So tasty the meal was, that we had a clean plate.I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to have authentic tamil nadu vegetarian food in Singapore.They are very cheap compared to other hotels

One of the best places in Singapore to have authentic Tamil Nadu meals and food. In our endeavor to find good Indian Vegetarian food, we reached this place as it is was recommended by a friend. This is the most authentic place I have found in Singapore which offers near Indian taste and good quality. It is simple, tasty fare which is on offer across counter. Breakfast and dinner include Idly, Dosa, Upma etc. In afternoon only meals are available apart from variety rice. Go for the meals, they are simply very delicious and tasty. Enjoy the place. A Must visit for Vegetarians staying in Singapore

Wow Just the fresh ground coirander and the Hing is enough to bring out the appetite in you. Mani iyer simple formula of Sambhar rasam more kootan avial and beans thoran is the just the right way for a sumptuous lunch and a 1 hour nap to make you fresh. Prices are very reasonable at about $12 for 2 people

Went with my Wife and Daughter for the South Indian lunch/meals. Had heard a lot about the place and how the food was very authentic Tam bram type of food. food was good but I would not call it exceptional or very different - we felt that Komalas (not Komala Vilas) had equally good perhaps better meals. meal portions at mani Iyer mess are huge. We also catered in idlis and lemon sevai when we had around 50People visiting us for Navratri - lemon sevai portion was enormous and good. Idli was okay

Firstly sorry for not writing about this place earlier , I had visited Singapore this year in May .. if you wish to feast on authentic tasty value for money south indian food dont think beyond , don go further , trust me i tasted food at anandha bhavan ,murugan idly, saravanas, komalavilas .. but nothing to beat Mani Iyers .. dont go by the ambience , the hospitality and care shown by these guys is awesome , u will have to wait endlessly at anada bhavan , saravanna and be ready for below grade food and service . This place will leave you with fond memories.

After hearing reviews that the food is good but the ambience is average, we still decided to grab a quick lunch. It was a weekday and less crowded and since we arrived at lunch time, only the meals and variety rice were available to choose from. The tables were clean and the place big, though not decorated to attract our aesthetic interest. The food was all hot and ready and served at once and large portion indeed! The taste of the Rasam, Sambhar and Tamarind Kuzhambu was too good and the butter milk was spiced well too. I am sure the South Indian tourists would feel at home here. The Variety Rice also had a good portion, and was served with Papadam and two vegetables. Value for Money! Go for it, if you are the spice lover and have a craving for Sambhar and Kuzhambu :

The expertise of this restaurant lies in South Indian food. The food is really cheap without trading-off taste. Unlike the popular restaurants in Little India, this one is inside a quiet locality, thereby not receiving the attention it deserves.Lighting is bit dull, and has a quiet ambiance; factors usually not associated with family restaurants.Give it a try, and you may think twice before going for other 'popular' Indian restaurants

I ordered a vegetarian meal for lunch. A classical south Indian mean with a desert and papadam for 7 SGD. The serving was huge- they even give your extra rice, sambhar or whatever you ask for. However the tastes were just like any other hotel and i was not really satisfied- may be i was over excited and expected more from the place. You would surely not be disappointed if you arent too picky

It is not value for money. Service takes long time. The taste is below average and the food is costly.

A better place for Vegetarian Tamil food. Not very expensive but worth for money. Poor service and more waiting time is a disadvantage. Horrible to wait when crowded.....

It is one of the best Vegetarian South Indian Thali had was at this place. It is a typical Tambrahm Hotel . The decor is unpretentious and the prices are extremely pocket friendly.It is tucked away off serangoon road and a little difficult to locate. But one of the best place for veg food

This restaurant is near "broadway hotel" It's located about 5 minutes walk from Ferrer Park St. " F" exit.I've ever eaten south India "meals" at 3 restaurant of this aria, I think this is best."Meals" is 7 dollars. It's cheap. More rice is free

Brilliant, economical, homely south indian pure veg food here..We loved their special lunch one of the days & regretted having not been able to visit them during our previous days...As their name suggest, its a mess, dont expect fancy ambiance, if you like pure south veg food (Not even garlic or onion) then this is the place for you, very close to ICIC Bank ATM at Saregoan R

This restaurant has authentic south Indian menu and the taste is awesome. It looks like a very normal open place kind of hawker but the place is worth the visit. The menu is limited hence less confusions. Chapathi is my favourite there. Very soft and spongy. Poori there does not have much oil and hence i like it too. Idly,Kal dosa etc are good too. No extra tax and hence less burden on the people. A must visit place to taste south Indian food

An unassuming restaurant in an unassuming place (Hindoo Road - off serangoon road) that serves the most authentic home cooked food! I was amazed by the quality and taste. A must for all south indian food fans. I would recommend a take away as the experience of sitting down and eating is not very nice. Also gear up for some bad service attitudes (who cares - if you are getting a wholesome meal for sgd 7!!

Good authentic brahmin vegetarian food. Not very expensive. Very affordable homely food outside our country. It very good. Thanks to tripvisor for showing me the options.

Its more of a mess than restaurent. The staff was not very helpful. Had two chapatis and Korma followed by coffee. Taste was good but they have very limited options.
5
Best south Indian food in brahmin style. Some of the menus you won't get else where in Singapore. South Indian meals are the best

Visited Mani Iyer Mess, just reopened, after a hiatus of 2-3 weeks, in its new location at 5 Hindoo Rd., just off Serangoon Road, 2 blocks from Mustafa's. The place is bigger and more airy, the meals are still good but I was disappointed that a restaurant specializing in Tambrahm food should add garlic to the vetha kozhambu, that's just not kosher, guys. The sambar, rasam and veggies were fine, and the price still very reasonable at $6. I would easily give it a 4 were it not for that goof-up with the garlic

This place is hidden away off Serangoon Road and is probably a little difficult to locate. I have visited this place for lunch a few times. Very tasty, homely and authentic South Indian food. While ambience is rather like most Indian places in Little India, the place is quite neat and clean and the food excellent at reasonable prices. I would go so far as to say that this is the closest you might get to traditional South Indian meal in Singapore. Shortage of expericenced staff sometimes gives an impression of slow service - especially when crowded and could be frustrating if you are in a hurry

is the first thing that comes to my mind when i think of Mani Iyer mess... The food is delicious and the quantity is just perfect...The "Parota" with kurma was exceptionally brilliant and so was the Puri masal.Just been once so cant comment on other stuff, but if you are around this place then dont hesitate a sec, just drop in and fill your tummy with great food. Dont worry it wont hurt your purse much... its very economical...Could roughly cost $10-12 (SGD) per person for a filling dinner. OOPPSSS missed to mention... They serve only Veg..

Had lunch at this small unpretentious restaurant today and enjoyed a satisfying wholesome South Indian vegetarian meal with 2 vegetables, kootu, sambar, vethai kozhambu, and rasam with appalam, buttermilk and a very tasty payasam to boot. The meal comes with a generous helping of rice, no chappathis, price very reasonable. Other tiffin dishes like idlis, dosas, pongal etc available only in the evenings (7-11 pm) and on weekend mornings upto 10 am. No air-con, but well ventilated, several ceiling fans, quite clean. The young lady at the counter was cheerful and provided all information. Parking available along Norris Road or at a URA car-park at the end of the road

On 14 April 2013 I had been to this restaurant. The food is excellent. It tastes great. We ordered for Onion Rava Dosa, Plain Dosa, Medhu Vada, 2 Idlis and coffee. The bill came to about SGD 13. I would strongly recommend this restaurant to any one looking for authentic homely and tasty south Indian vegetarian food
