We went for the Chinese special meal Which is an event as well as a meal. Great fun and good food with special acclaim to the Lobster and the Wagyu beef. Staff very attentive and keen to-explain each dish. Really great experience on comfortable surroundings
4
I like the restaurant that having dinner accompanied by the beautiful traditional music. The food is very good.
5
Flavours abound at this restaurant with their signature dishes like the pumpkin soup where the soup is served inside an actual baby pumpkin. Service is excellent and ambience refined
5
Food is exquisite and the portions were divided for us without hassle. Was surprised by how they carved the pumpkin and served soup within. Enjoyed!

We dined at Golden Peony @ Conrad Centennial Singapore for lunch. Food quality is good but the service needs improvement. Staff seems to be inexperienced, did not top up tea/drinks & did not clear empty plates even tho' they past by the table many times.
4
As we were staying at Conrad we tried Golden Peony as it is a highly recommended joint. But we being vegetarians were short of options. However ambiance was great, staff was courteous, service was good. Overall we had a good time in the restaurant rather than having good food
4
Dined while staying at the Conrad, the food was absolutely Devine, delicious and without question amazing. However the service was quite bad. We opted for a 6 course menu, but before we had even finished one course the next would be already ready waiting which I find absolutely appalling. We told the restaurant manager and they agreed to slow the service down. Overall loved the food, but would have to think about getting a multiple course menu here
4
They had a bew trainee perhaps? The main server have to keep asking her to do stuff like change plates or top up drinks, etc. They were standing close enough that we could hear and it is distracting and affected the overall ambience of the dining experience. We ordered some sugar cane and chestnut drink and the trainee did not even check before topping up the glass with regular tea. Also, we wanted hot water instead of tea and she again filled the cups with tea instead of water. Finally, when we were ready to settle the bill, the cashier or someone (not our server, haven't seen her all night) came to our table with a bill that's already paid and somone else's credit card
5
The pleasant experience starts from the moment you walk into the restaurant. The ambience is among the best in Singapore. The food is truely authentic Cantonese, which is hard to come by nowadays. The service is flawless. Only weak point is the dessert, presumably not their forte
5
Service runs like clockwork, never misses a beat, and indeed very warm and friendly at the same time. The food is well executed, divine in it's simplicity and exquisite in it's presentation. At the end it is all about taste and after many visits have to say this is in my mind top 2 chinese restaurant in Singapore. They can do multiple courses and time it perfectly for the occasion you have. If you need to go back to work they can serve you within an hour a multiple course feast. But I would take my sweet old time and indulge for a long lunch to truly appreciate this very fine restaurant. Consistent excellence over the years
5
we had 2 guests with 3 of us (5 altogether) for dinner. Every dish was superb, and the service was friendly and attentive all the way from beginning to end.
5
The food served here was fabulous. The staff were very helpful and courteous. Would definitely dine here again
5
The Cantonese cuisine was excellent. The London Roast Dick was my favourite dish - roasted to perfection - not too soft, not too hard.
5
One of my favourites, a classy and elegant Cantonese restaurant. Reasonably priced and delicious. Would come back again.

Used to dine frequently at this restaurant some years back but it's been a while since I last visited. Thankfully standards have been maintained. Tried the dinner set menu and enjoyed my meal. Just one area for improvement would be the timing between the serving of each course. Think the kitchen prepared each item too quickly which meant that the fish course was left sitting at the side table for too long resulting in the dish turning cold.
1
A restaurant with no services. No topping up of drink, no change of dirty plate and even the steam fish was not properly cooked. This was not the first time we patronized the place. When we were there 2,3 months ago we were asked to arrive early (the restaurant was still not ready to server customers) and vacated the table well before another guest arrived.( What type of the customer services was that??). This time no services was provided unless we requested for it. Besides the dishes we ordered was not served together and worst still the fish was not well cook. We ordered a steam fish, half roasted duck, a fried vegetables and a bowl of steam rice. They served us the fried veggies and rice but the fish and duck was not served till we almost finished our rice and veggies and we needed to ask for it. I noticed that they were only concentrating in serving the big table and didn't care about the little one. May be this is the way they earn their revenue
5
Compliments to Jean Chong and Eileen Goh for the 6 stars service. Compliments for the Chef and team. Mom said the London duck and braised pork belly are very good, not chewy and tough. The sea perch wrapped with lobster meat and clay port prawn glass noodles are excellent. The deep fried Maine lobster with almond flakes and curry leaves was a tad salty. Overall, excellent
2
This is a nice and pleasant restaurant with a good service team. Their car park was pleasant and not over crowded. Overall, the chef's cooking was creative ( meaning he tried hard!) but not memorable. We had Crispy lobster topped with almond flakes- the lobster was over fried but the flakes were tasty. The Roast pork layered with foie gras was creative. The Hongkong shrimp noodles were soggy and disappointing. Their Dessert platter comprising 3 items was beautifully presented. Of these, the Malaiko was dry, not spongy enough, and tasteless. The other two, red dates pastry and custard and bak kwa pastry, were good.
2
Visited with family members. All members did not like the quality & cooking style. Quality & Quantity were questionable. Ordered steamed live fish, sauce & condiments were very very little, barely enough to portion equally making the expensive dish very under rated. Tim Sum badly made with items half spilled & missing. Fried food items were soaking in oil... etc. despite ordering their signature dishes... endless questionable outcome, very different from other chinese restaurants we frequent. Regretted visiting.

This was our first time at Golden Peony, and we were here for my granny’s birthday. The restaurant is beautifully furnished, with a very pleasantly muted and warm color scheme. The high ceiling and substantial furniture make the space feel really grand, and elevates the ambience on a whole.The food was generally good, most of the dishes were done decently well. Nothing spectacular, but the “Bi Feng Tang” roasted chicken was deliciously moist and flavorful. The Peking duck was just average - the skin was not crisp enough and the fats needed to be rendered down more. The roast and cold cut platter we had ordered, included a very lackluster roasted pork that did not have much meat and the skin was not ideally crisp. The steamed fish however, was really fresh and tender. The other dishes - asparagus with scallops in XO sauce, stir fried vegetable, and seafood with beancurd in clay pot - were pretty much averagely tasty classic Chinese restaurant dishes. Nothing much to rave about the food other than the roasted chicken.The service was very good; the servers were friendly and attentive. However, the staff were not very clear on some of the privileges we were entitled to. Overall, Golden Peony is a solid classic Chinese restaurant. Nothing much to rave about, but nothing bad either. They’ve got a great deal if you’re in a group of two using The Platinum Card by American Express
4
Dinner was provided with a luxury escapes package and it was exactly as I expected. 5 delicious fine dining and courses and great service. Wine is pricey though, extensive selection available.
4
We came here and decided for the dry menu.
Everything was ok and good. The duck was superb as the desert.
But I don't know if I would come back.
The restaurant was very cold, and the service quite nice.
5
We had a meal in this restaurant as part of our hotel package. Ours was a five course degustation. This was a modern Chinese take on tradition and it was scrumptious.
5
Love the Braised Vermicelli with duo Scallops! I ate in this restaurant on Friday and Sunday. That's 2 days in a week! Must like the food!
3
The food is not bad but for the price I paid, I would expect the quality to be better.As for service, it took them close to 30 min to serve the first dish. Subsequently, the dishes were served fast but it took them forever to serve the last dish
5
We had a five-course dinner there and the experience was wonderful. The food was really good and the service excellent. We were the only ones in the restaurant when we walked in and the only other people to come in during the two hours we were there was a Chinese couple. So we practically had the place to ourselves and that was lovely as we really enjoy our meal without people buzzing around.
5
A fine dining Chinese restaurant tucked away in Conrad Centennial. The food is top class yet affordable. I am becoming such a fan of this place. The decor is classy. The service attentive. Nice ambience... was not crowded at all when we were there. Delicious food... will definitely be back

In pricy Singapore you can easily burn a $100 for very little reward because the gross profit in restaurant TOP %600. Ie cost of ingredients is less than 15% of price charged. This is the reason for restaurant mushrooming all over tiny SingaporeNow at Golden Peony, food is priced more competitively partly because it is located in the CBD area and partly competition. But food and services are first class . The Peking duck is served the usual way but with a piece of crunchy piece of Beancurd to enhance your pleasure biting into it. The Bi Fung Tong lobster and chicken are expertly done. Tim Sum is innovating. Pastry wrapped century egg with braised pork is their latest addition. And their soup of the day at $8 per servicing should wane you off any order of beverage. And for celebration open a bottle of Laurent Perrier champagne for $95, very good and excellent value. To TOP it off there are various promotions. A survival card commands 30% discount on table bill. Amex platinum discounts range from 20-50%. I took my Wife and 4 year old grand Daughter there for lunch and got 50% off on my Amex. That is call smart dining
4
We had a degustation meal at the Golden Peony which was very good. The food came our at a good rate, plenty of time between courses. Waitress was good, not many people in the restaurant when we ate but as we were leaving more came in
1
1. Restaurant called 4 times with regards to reservation timing and menu2. Have confirmed the reservation timing in the afternoon and yet still got the timing wrong.3. Reserved set menu and 2 out of the 4 dishes were not available and had to be changed to something else. When asked if we could do away with the set menu and switched to ala carte, service staff pretended not to hear4. Was told by service staff that the 2nd complimentary car park was given out of goodwill5. Roast duck tasted like microwaved foo
5
Returned to this wonderful restaurant and once again am delighted by the quality of the food and the warm friendly service of the staff. Will definitely return again!
5
Good food. Good ambience. Good service. Claypot seasfood Beancurd, coffee ribs and glass noodles were all good

~upon entering from the main lobby entrance with driveway (the other entrance directly opposite is a dropoff) take the carpark lift on the left up to level 3~we'd the earliest 11am "Chope" reservation and the wait staff were still having their daily briefing outside the restaurant at the greeter stand, they all stopped talking and a few turn their attention immediate to me and oe led me to the table :)~there are also a few tables outside the restaurant overlooking the hotel lobby you can dine at~walking in there's a large wall of well deserved food awards dating back about 20 years~I'd been interested in their weekend dim sum tasting menu and it was suggested by the waitress at the onset, my wife was worried that 10 dishes would be too much but we were assured that for sharing the portions for 2 will be just enough~there were a choice 4 dim sum (just 2 delectable pieces), 1 soup, 4 specialty mains & 1 dessertServed in order of appearance-Prawn Dumpling (Har Gow) came together with the Siew Mai in the bamboo steamer, but were dry and a bit tasteless+Beancurd Skin Roll Prawn with Seaweed had a good flavorsome vinegar dip +Wan Ton with Spicy Sauce wasn't a typical fried wanton, it came steamed swimming in a truly well spiced sauce that packed a great punch YUMz x2+Hot & Sour soup absolutely delicious YUMz+Wasabi Prawns just 4 pieces with strawberries & mango slices YUMz x2+Beef Cubes with Black Pepper WOW super tasty & tender fresh YUMz x3+Scallops with Coral Clams were 2 morsels of well seasoned scallops in a XO sauce on a bed of broccoli YUMz+Mian Xian this thin vermicelli (bee hoon) cooked just right, looks much but when divided into 2 bowls served just 2 portions of yummy noodles YUMz x3+fresh homemade soya beancurd came as I remember delicate scoops of melt in my mouth goodness YUMz x2B!G THUNBS UP

Brought overseas guests for a celebratory dinner. The soap was first to arrived and was way too salty for every guest. Even the dong po pork was so saltish a few guests left it untouched. The wasabi prawns was the best dish to save the dinner. The worst came when the fish slices in the noodles were so foul-smelling I had to spit it out! After bringing it up to the waitress, the Chef came to the table to explain that the fish is " not unfresh, it's just the taste of this type of fish"! I didn't know a fine dining restaurant can serve this type of foul- smelling and extremely fishy odor "type of fish". I don't even recall any coffee shop zhichar having this type of fish in their noodles even! Will not recommend nor return again
3
Had a set menu here, wasn't that impressed by the food. Portions small and food wasn't as good as I was expecting. The service by the young man who waited on us was fantastic though. He was extremely attentive. Be prepared to pay high prices for a bottle of wine. I think the cheapest was $85 a bottle and at the end of the day it wasn't worth the price
5
Nestled on the third floor of Conrad Hotel, the ambience is elegant, classy and quiet. Not opulent, not over-the-top, not ostentatious, just sophisticated. The dishes are intricate and flavourful. Service is attentive and subtle. We had six dishes (Prawn, scallop, vegetable, pork rib, duck, dessert) for about S$90 per head, and 8 of us drunk five and a half bottles of wine and they are very kind to waive our corkage fees, as we had informed them during booking. We have an exquisite experience, and would definitely return soon. Highly recommended if you enjoy entertaining in style
5
As expected, this restaurant maintains serve quality food. Their roast platter allows one to choose between 3 to 4 roast items. The roast pork and drunken chicken roll are good. I tried the grouper slices with greens. It did not disappoint me. For dessert, one may try the egg white tarts which are not too sweet. The serving staff is attentive and able to recommend dishes to suit one's preference
4
Service need to improve!Food is above average (3.8/5)Few dishes to recommend: 1) Double-boiled Fish Maw and Conpoy in Superior Fish Broth2) Lobster Meat wrapped with sliced Fish and Fish Roe,served with Baby Spinach3)Wok-fried Rice Noodle (Hor Fun) with Seafood4) Avocado with ice-cream (dessert)We tried their roast duck and roast pork just, it was just so so (2.5/5). Nothing to shout about
5
This is "serious" restaurant and has a menu according to that feel. Offers the difference between "fish" and "live fish". One is chilled and the other is caught that day or pulled out of a tank. There is of course a huge price difference...Food was fabulous and luckily I had a local to do the ordering for me.
5
Dined at this award winning restaurant in the Conrad Centennial Hotel complex and was impressed with the quality and unique dishes served. The food was of a high standard and delicious. Prices are on the high side along with the wine list but worth it for the experience and quality. The service was impeccable with nothing left to fault
3
Food quality is pretty decent but not fantastic. Restaurant deco can be improved. It was too quiet with the almost inaudible background music
5
Today I treated a Friend to a scrumptious meal. Everything from the standard of food, atmosphere and service was fantastic. And I got 50% discount for using the Amex Platinum Card. Highly recommend!
4
Waitresses were attentive & offered great service. Food was fresh & of good quality. Had the beef which was tender, wasabi prawns were crispy, dessert - cream of avocado & ice cream was refreshing & delicious!
2
We waited for almost 45mins for food to be served. We would expect overall better service and from such established restaurant.
4
A five course meal was included with our luxury escape package and the food was very enjoyable with helpful satff.
4
We ordered the a la carte. Our most favourite dishes are Suckling pig (skin it is crispy) and the sweet and sour prawn with Mango. It is a rather quite dinning environment. Overall is good.
2
Poor & over rated is the only words worth the comment, on this Chinese restaurant under the name of such a established hotel as the Conrad.
5
Excellent service with a wide variety of food for lunch & dinner. Dim sum menu is limited to the popular kinds one get in most restaurant.
5
We went back again to the restaurant for our 25th wedding anniversary and we ate a total of five times during our entire stay at the hotel. Is that good! The restaurant manager Eileen went above and beyond to make our wedding anniversary a memorable one! She gave us a nice table and offer us complimentary pink champagne and dessert for my daughter! She even made a customized menu for each of us for the course meal because I only eat seafood and chicken (I don't eat duck, beef, or pork) and my daughter likes beef and some seafood. But my husband eats anything! And she even printed our personalized menu and placed them on our table! She remembered that we like the Calamansi juice and offered to us regardless of whether we are having dim sum for lunch or set course for dinner! The food was awesome and they did not charge us for the table placement this time even when we host a lunch at their VIP room! During the lunch, the waitress would replenish the ox sauce and chilies for us! Frankly, I have never seen a restaurant who does that unless you ask for them! They also offers complimentary wet cotton towels before and after meal which is not seen in Singapore (maybe in Hong Kong they still offers them)! Don't forget to go try out Golden Peony next time you stay at the hotel because you will not regret it! My husband thinks that it's the best restaurant in Singapore and I think so too
4
Great place for business lunch as it has a calm and peaceful ambience. The service staffs are very professional and attentive most of the time. Most of them serve the food and tea from the right except one staff keep standing in the middle of us to service us both as it is easier for her. Her service can be a concern if it is a formal business lunch meeting. That why it is a 4 stars this time.Food wise it is pretty good and usual hotel Chinese restaurant standard.I will not hesitate to bring important guest and have my business clients again. Hopefully we will be not serve by that one particular waitress in any way, if it is an important meeting
1
Prawn dumpling was so hard. Signature eefu noodle with king prawn is overly salty. Worst char siew bun ever. So much so for a 5 star hotel dim sum.
5
We had the five Course Meal at this restaurant and couldn't fault any dish. All so delicious with beautiful presentation
5
This is not just a typical Chinese restaurant. The dishes we ate had a delicacy and flavour that was well above the average. Service good. Wine prices high which is normal for Singapore
5
Outstanding food and service, but pricey. An experience if you want to experience fine dining. Took my family here, we got dressed up and enjoyed the evening.
5
We had a lovely but small meal here and the meal although I do not eat seafood was great. They were accommodating and brought our grandson plain rice and it was a lovely relaxed last dinner for our family.
5
As part of our Luxury Escapes deal we booked into Golden Peony and we were not disappointed the food was elegant and tasty, a lovely meal.
5
We had dinner with friends which was part of our holiday package which was a 5 course meal. We were offered the option of adding another course, but decided against it, which we feel was the right decision as the food was delicious and substantial enough not to warrant another course. My favourite was an amazing fish dish and surprisingly the desert, I am not normally a fan of asian deserts. The atmosphere is a little stark, but we still had an enjoyable night with our friends
5
I am notoriously suspicious of hotel restaurants but I am pleased to say this is a particularly good one. It is more a package experience - excellent service, nice setting and pretty good food. The roast duck is to die for and the suckling pig is just evil. Dishes are on the small side but the food is rich so it works out okay. The only fails were the desserts - the avocado one in particular was the visual equivalent of a frog in a blender. To be fair, I find a lot of Asian desserts too sweet so don't be put off by my opinion. Price wise, it is on the upper side but again, for a hotel restaurant, I think it is actually good value. One tip - go a la carte - I think you have better options than what are on the set menus
3
We wouldn't have gone to this restaurant except we had a special offer for the Conrad Hotel that included dinner at this restaurant. The offer included a 5 course degustation which was fine without being great but every bottle of wine was over $90. The food was light so big eaters may want to add more food. Service was good albeit luke warm.
3
Whilst the food was excellent the service was non existent the wine was warm and it had no ambience. This restaurant is in a time warp and needs a major revamp. 20 years ago this place would have been the place to go but time has passed it by and it's got lost in the abyss.
5
A set Asian five course with an optional extra course (S$16-50) if you are really hungry. But the set amount was more than adequate. Drinks were not cheap, but the meal was part of a deal with the room.
5
WE had been taken here for lunch. Wow this hidden gem is food to crave for. Ok for wheelchair access as it has a lift. Toilets take your own paper just in case. Food yum,yum..Service was outstanding
2
The Chinese restaurants of Sydney and Hong Kong have nothing to be worried about here. Very ordinary Cantonese food in small serves at high prices. Do they bother , plenty of better food to be had in Singapore at far less money.
5
Food was awesome and service wonderful ! Especially the manager in charge the hotel who tried to accommodate us when the chope app did not capture our reservation.
5
Had a six course meal here. Every course was slightly different to the average chinese fare and was delicious. The wait staff were very attentive but not overbearing. The wine list was very good and reasonably priced for such a restaurant. Would recommend a meal here
5
We have just enjoyed a fabulous 5 course meal here. We loved it. Our wait person, Jennie Yang, was perfect in her attention to detail and she had the ability to be there when needed without being obvious. I hope her employer appreciates her half as much as we did - she is a treasure! We really enjoyed it
2
We stayed at the Conrad so naturally visited this restaurant especially after hearing the reviews. What a disappointment. Overpriced average food. Very very small portions. we had a 5 course set meal and was in and out within the hour and it wasn't us wolfing down the tiny plates it was how the service was delivered. We complained about it, and received a nice apology and a box of chocs which was a lovely touch, but it should not have had to happen. i think they rely on the Michelin star status and not what they deliver. We are returning to Conrad again in October this year but will be giving this restaurant a miss
4
This restaurant was listed in top 10 dim sum by Ladyironchef website so I was looking forward to eating here. Ambience is clearly high-class and restaurant only had a few occupied tables but service in terms of tea replenishment was slow. Only 10 items on dim sum menu - too restricted - but the 7 dishes we ordered contained very high quality ingredients and was well prepared. Highlights were the fried char siu bun - can't remember what they called it, har gao (shrimp dumpling) and spicy pork dumpling. Yang chao fried rice was also delicious. Would recommend they add a few more dim sum items - cheong fun, spare ribs - without compromising on qualit
5
We had a most fantastic 5 course diner at Golden Peony @Conrad Centennial SingaporeThis meal was included in our Luxury Escape Package, 4 couples celebrating 70th Birthdays and also a couple of wedding anniversaries.There was a set menu for the included diner, this was during the Lunar New Year celebrations, staff were wonderful, very attentive explaining each dish for us. One guest did not eat Duck, so an alternative dish was offered, one did not eat prawns so another alternative was there. We had a great surprise at the end of our meal as the assistant manager SharMayn had organised a joint Birthday Cake for the 3 having Birthdays, a lovely gesture and very much appreciated
4
We had our yearly CNY dinner here again tonight and the food standard is good as usual. The Loi-Hei always impresses us. They normally make an effort to decorate it. We had 7 course dinner (including the Loi-hei dish) and all of us were very full as the portion is quite big for each dish. Overall, a good experience.
4
We enjoyed a 5 course banquet at the restaurant, which was of exceptional quality, and I would recommend the restaurant.
5
Had two fantastic lunches here recently. The staff couldn't do more and were very happy to assist put together a menu that suited our requirements. Great dragon pearl tea!
5
I celebrated my 60th Birthday at this wonderful Chinese Restaurant. The food was simply delicious with a very good wine selection as well.
Thanks for a memorable evening.
4
This place is always consistently good lunch or dinner, it is worth a visit for a nice Chinese meal - been many times
5
Set 5 course meal as part of the package. Beautifully presented and very tasty. The meal was not rushed. Each course came out after an appropriate interval. The service was excellent but not intrusive.
4
Was hosted to lunch in a private room. As it was the 7th day of CNY, the restaurant was busy and all rooms were occupied. Food and Service was at its usual good mark, attentive and food was served well and in the correct portions. The Yu Sheng was beautifully arranged into a shape of a phoenix. Highlight was the "nian gao" at the end
4
Had Christmas dinner here and quite enjoyed it ....we had 5 course meal with an optional beef dish for $14 extra so we took it ...the piece of meat was very tasty but small ....the whole meal itself was very nice but the portions small ...
3
Golden Peony clearly used to be a top shelf chinese restaurant with many awards displayed near the entry. Trouble is all of the actual awards on display were won many years ago. We had the tasting menu. Food was well cooked and seasoned but really lacked any imagination and came very fast for this style of menu. We were finished our 5 plus courses and wine in an hour. No mystery courses or anything special to showcase the chefs talents. A la carte appears the way to go here. There are better places to eat this style of food
4
We asked our hotel concierge for a restaurant recommendation and she suggested this place as she used to work there. We arrived in a taxi and made our way upstairs. No other diners but it was exactly midday. Soon filled up. Service was very efficient and we never had an empty cup of jasmine tea. We choose off the dim sum menu and found each dish delicious. BBQ meats especially. We could see other diners sharing al a carte meals that looked good too. Decor of the restaurant is elegant traditional. I can see quite a few negative reviews but our experience was very good.
5
This five-star five-course dining experience was set a menu included in our hotel package. My friend and I did request no seafood though, and with their on point service, they happily accomodated. Every course was an experience in itself. Unique and authentic blend of taste and textures. Loved it from beginning to end. Was truly fantastic
5
The staff were friendly and the food good. Like the dessert most. Would recommend for family outings.
3
Few choices on the dim sum menu, good quality of food in general. Service polite but slow. There are surly better places in Singapore. We choose to stay here as we were hotel guests.
5
We spent an evening at the Golden Peony the food was delicious the service exceptional, a wonderful eating experience, loved the prawn dish
5
Had dinner at private room for over 30 pax. Everyone enjoyed the Chef's menu
It was well executed and prettily presented. Service was extremely attentive! Will definitely come back.
3
We had a meal at the Golden Peony as part of our package. I'm not a huge fan of Cantonese food, but it was well cooked and presented and the service was most attentive. The wine was massively expensive!
2
We ate here as it was included as part of a Luxury Escape package: a five course meal at the Golden Peony. It was one of the weirdest and most disappointing dining experiences we have had in recent years. There is zero atmosphere in the restaurant and awkwardness prevails. None of the staff greeted us or spoke to us throughout the ordeal. The restaurant was less than half full so not busy but staff didn't seem to interact with any of the other diners either. Dishes were plonked in front of us without any discussion. One of the dishes was brought out to a nearby serving table and then sat there for five or so minutes getting cold before being brought to our table. There was minimal food and one of the five courses was a fairly ordinary fried rice. We were glad when the meal was concluded
2
We had a free meal as part of a luxury escapes package - this was the low point of our stay at the Conrad. The staff are lovely and I'm sorry to give this such a poor rating but the dishes are very very average. Portions are tiny, I mean tiny! The restaurant wasn't busy and I can see why - style over substance. Save your money and head down the road to the Ritz Carlton's Colony - you'll love it. Or have a Big Mac before you eat here
2
We had a five course set menu dinner as a part of our Luxury Escapes package. The staff - while lovely - were just a bit too keen, and it almost felt as if they were watching our every move. The decor was dated, and the restaurant felt stuffy. Our duck pancakes were tasty, but everything else was very average. I felt as though a lot of the dishes could have been made straight from a jar of Kang Tong. My husband asked for a mojito, and was given a non-alcoholic version. Alcoholic were expensive.Save your money and go elsewhere.
5
Regretfully I didn't take my camera to dinner but wish I had.Beautiful sofisticated (oppsy) restaurant located on the 4th floor of the Conrad Centennial Hotel.Staff were truly fantastic, helpful & service was first class.As was the five course set menu we were offered."Appeared" to be smallish serving but we were indeed full & content at the end. Each course was beautifully presented & delicious. Staff were great on answering questions without making us feel stupid about what we were about to try. The table settings & surrounding were beautiful. It was indeed a very memorable meal & will visit again
4
We had a lovely experience of eating a set menu at this restaurant. There was a lovely ambiance to this restaurant and the temperature was lovely if you are not used to the heat in Singapore. We chose a 5 course set menu and whilst each course was extremely well presented and delicious to eat, we felt rushed through the meal as we had barely swallowed the last mouthful when the plate was taken from us and the next one placed down, so I did feel we were somewhat rushed. The peking duck was simply devine! My only downside is that drinks are very expensive in this restaurant. A glass of wine and a soft drink was nearly $40. Compared to Australian prices I deem that very expensive. We were given a survey to complete at the end which did seem a little odd, but we did have a chance there to note the alcohol prices as that was one of their questions: did we think it was too expensive? The service of the staff could not be faulted, I just wish they had slowed down the service a little
4
We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Golden Peony. The food was good and the service friendly. Wine prices as expected in Singapore.
4
I ate a preset 5 course menu that was part of my accomodation package.
The food was superb and the service attentive.
I had one 150ml glass of red - came to $23 including taxes and service
5
Love the atmosphere and service there. The food is well portioned, cooked and served. Very authentic!
5
A dining experience second to none, We had an evening meal included in our package, The food was exceptional and the service was to the same level
5
Food was real good, but we had it 5mins before closing hence was quite rush.
For the ambience, it was really quiet and soothing ;)
5
Food was excellent. Ingredients were fresh and tasty. All the staff were always friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back!
3
Our family tried this restaurant in August 2016. The food was good but it was on the expensive side. The Michelin-starred Chinese resto at nearby Suntec was much better.

I attended a wedding dinner with 32 tables.The food was served from Golden Peony. It is one of the best wedding dinner food, where often quality suffers as the number of tables increases. Such was not the case with Golden Peony.Every dish was good to great from the combination starter to the dessert. I must go back to the restaurant for a meal

Late dinner in September when there were only 4 tables occupied. Very attentive service and good recommendations of selections. The set menu comes with degustation size portions of seafood and meat where some dishes can be considered fusion while others are traditionally Cantonese. Ingredients pretty fresh. A very calming environment. There are many high end Chinese restaurants in the area, particularly in hotel dining, and the price charged is relatively competitive in the area. Bright lights
5
The dishes were new age Cantonese - traditional superb quality but with a modern twist. King prawn with blueberry sauce, lobster meat wrapped in sliced fish, pan fried kurobuta pork and best of all, cream of avocado with vanilla ice cream! Attentive service made this meal absolutely enjoyable.
4
Almost a legend in local Cantonese fine dining. Still lives up to its name. The service staff are somewhat harassed though and they seem short handed. Food-wise the restaurant delivered especially in the vegetarian choices as we had vegan guests.
5
We had a five course dinner here two weeks ago and the food was lovely. The servings were very small, but very tasty. The service was excellent.
5
We had a 5 course degestation menu and all of the food was fantastic. The wine is also very good with a reasonable selection from around the world.

One of the most outstanding Chinese restaurants in Singapore, the elegant GOLDEN PEONY RESTAURANT is located in the CONRAD CENTENNIAL SINGAPORE. Besides their delicate and special dim sums, my favourite dish must be their double boiled seafood soup in young coconut. This is a clear soup with pieces of succulent seafood and definitely a must order! Equally stunning is their PEKING DUCK which has super thin skin with tender meat - yummy!! To finish off I highly recommend the cold avocado purée with a large dollap of coconut ice cream or aloe vera with fruit salad in lime juice - very refreshing

We dined here as a couple, part of a package deal staying at the Conrad. The setting is spectacular, coming through the hotel lobby up a sweeping staircase with a grand chandelier to the restaurant.We had the five course dinner that others mention. I don't know the cost as it was included as mentioned above, but I presume it was expensive.Service as not bad, but somewhat indifferent. I was expecting a fine dining experience, and this was where the whole experience was just short of expectation. There was no attempt to explain anything about the food. The courses were small but delicious; delightful flavours and everything well cooked and beautifully presented. The courses came a bit close together for my liking, just a few minutes between courses, not sure why it was all a bit hurried. The table next door had a couple of women with a small baby, which was fine, but someone brought in some McDonalds for the child and this was plonked on their table - not what I expect to see in fine dining restaurant!The wine is very expensive- we had a $50 credit as part of our package also which lessened the blow; the Leeuwin Estate Art Series riesling complimented the food well for $128 Sing including taxes.Overall a memorable meal but could have been better with attention to a few of these details
4
Had a lovely 5-course meal with a wide variety of flavours. All the courses were very tasty and we could see the effort taken to prepare and present everything to make it all special. The cost of drinks was excessive and we had the cheapest bottle of south african red wine for eighty dollars, ouch. Nice and quiet with plenty of space between tables
5
Sublime dining. We sampled at five course set dinner menu which was exceptional. Although I am not a food photo snapper this was the first time I was tempted to become one. Wonderful plating and combination of flavours. The serving staff were well trained and knowledgable. A dinner to linger in the memory
5
I am writing a review after a couple of visits to this restaurant, love the pecking duck. Their set menu is good and usually the best. When you go al-a-cart then you can look at ordering their wasabi prawns, gill fish, awesome dim sum. Don't forget to end it with their avocado coconut ice cream which is by far the best dessert. Service is always with a smile. Great place for a business lunch or for special occasion.
5
We had a set 5 course menu. Tiny portions but some of the tastiest food I have had. Fresh, light and satisfying. Lovely ambience, friendly professional staff. Good lounge music. The set menus start at $68++ so it's not a value for money restaurant. The cheapest bottle of wine $100++. Good for a special dinner
5
As a longtime fan of Cantonese food, I had heard good things about Golden Peony with my wife, so we headed over to treat ourselves time together after a long working week. The Seafood Crispy Noodle in Chili Egg Gravy was fantastic, and my wife chose some Dim Sum among a large a la carte selection, and said they were excellent. We decided to go for an original dessert : Vanilla ice cream with Avocado juice. At first the taste took some getting used to (I’m usually more of a chocolate lover), but in the end the avocado was quite refreshing and balanced well with the sweetness of the ice cream. The service was professional and efficient, and I noticed they have a private room which looked very appropriate for dining with colleagues, especially since the location is so convenient. Definitely a place I will come back, including with guests looking for classic, yet chic Cantonese
5
The food was nice, small portions. But $18 for a glass of house red? Bit steep....
Good service, nice ambience.
5
The restaurant is excellent , the food was wonderful cooked to perfection, we had a five course meal and enjoyed everything.
The staff are very attentive which makes for a lovely meal to remember.
5
Best Dinner for us ever in Singapore. We really enjoyed every course and the service was the best possible
5
Enjoyed this restaurant; our group ate here two nights during our trip. Excellent Chinese food giving us variety and quality.
5
I've eaten my fair share of Chinese food but this was a whole new league. I partook of the five course set menu and was totally blown away by each dish that came out. Portions were 'small' (but more than adequate) and every course was a new revelation. An example is the first course (and signature dish) which was a take on the traditional favourite, Peking Duck. It arrived 'deconstructed' with a thin pancake layered with some parma ham, a slice of pineapple (who ever would have thought this would work? But the flavour was amazing), tender duck meat and some cucumber, with smears of plum sauce. Beautiful presentation, flawless table service, an overall wonderful dining experience
5
From the moment we arrived the attention from the staff was excellent. I had informed the Conrad that I required gluten free and was very pleasantly surprised to find that there was a specially printed menu for me for our 5 course dinner. The food was beautifully presented with wonderful flavours. Very tiny portions for each course was the ony disappointment, though not enough to spoil a wonderful evening
4
We had a wonderful meal at the restaurant. Between us, we ordered 4 dishes. Each was cooked with perfection. Based on health reason, we asked for certain dietary requirements, the restaurant was able to accommodate perfectly. Chinese cuisine can be lean and tasty without too much oil. We asked for a common Hong Kong dish. Unfortunately, the HK head chef was not around. They were willing to tell us in good faith that they were not comfortable to try out. We appreciate honesty.
5
Food was fresh, each plate was carefully crafted. My only minus point was the dessert, we had almond cream with bird nest and avocado cream with vanilla ice cream.Bird nest taste plastic or agar agar-ishAvocado cream only had slight avocado taste with loads of sugar.Staffs were attentive,filling up our tea every time.We like our visit Husband's complain was the portion of the stir fried beef we had was too small
3
Visited Golden Peony on Mother's Day and ordered the a la carte "buffet" that was priced per diner. The premium soups (part of the deal) was excellent. The main course (selection of 4 dishes) was very disappointing. Over portioned with sub quality offerings particularly the barbecue duo. The shrimp with blueberry sauce was blend and weird with a blue mayo dressing (resembled a cross between a blueberry smoothie & yogurt) which was neither refreshing nor interesting. The beef and Kong Bak was alright but not spectacular. This fortunately left little room in our tummy for the ordinary dim sum which had a suspicious "central kitchen" look about them. A far cry from the delicate morsels that Golden Peony used to serve up for their a la carte dim sum.The service was very good though and the restaurant was a pleasant room.We walk away feeling disappointed. Our previous dining experiences at Golden Peony was always good. Though prices were comparatively high we found that the value did commensurate with the price
4
went with a larger group of people, had a separate room, everything was prepared according to our liking.Food presentation was very good, taste good - some food items very good.Wine selection acceptable but waiters do not know much about wine.Waiters in general very friendly and well trained.In all a nice experience in an exclusive environment but quite expensive too
5
My boyfriend's birthday and we want to have good food and Golden Peony is offering 1FOR1 so we thought we try.
Glad we did.
5
This can be a special occasion restaurant for locals so a reservation in advance is a good idea. The hotel keeps a couple tables available for guests near the entryway just in case. Appetizers were delicious and my Peking duck was excellent.
3
We were a bit disappointed with this restaurant and thought the food was rather average but very expensive.
5
Worth the visit nice variety chilli mussels or deep fried prawns I would recommend it to anyone travelling
3
Service is good.
Food is average in terms of taste.
Food presentation is good.
A nothing great restaurant which you can try.
5
Seafood Crispy Noodle in Chili Egg Gravy is to die for! The combination of taste and textures work so well that it leaves you wanting more!
5
We had a set menu meal here, and both the quality of the food and its presentation were exceptional. They knew that we were in a bit of a rush, and were very accommodating in keeping everything moving swiftly. Judging by how busy it was, this restaurant must have a good local reputation.

Went to Golden Peony to check out the Restaurant Week Set lunch menu with my extended family. The menu was $40 per pax before taxes, snacks and drinks and comprises an appetiser (jelly fish, two slices of chicken, fried prawn), abalone and bamboo pith in fish stock, crispy egg noodle with seafood and avocado cream with vanilla ice cream.The appetiser wasn't too impressive. But the soup was quite good. Stock was slightly thick and tasty, with a whole baby abalone and two small pieces of bamboo pith. The crispy egg noodle in seafood broth was really good, the accompany slices of fried duck (?) wasn't great though. The broth had a slice of fish meat, a prawn and a stalk of kailan. Bite into the crunchy texture of the fried egg noodles after it has soaked up some of the broth for the taste. Dessert was not too bad, the avocado cream did taste a bit raw, and it was good that the sweetness of the vanilla ice cream helped overcome some of that raw taste. Service from the manager was good. We supplemented the set menu (not enough for the adults, just sufficient for the kids) with some dim sum and a whole roast peking duck. She helped to recommend signature dim sum dishes for us to try. The other wait staff was unable to recommend anything. What really bugged me was that the menu had only indicated that the herbal tea cost $5 per person and was free flow. A few of my family members orders Long Jing tea. They did not inform us that this tea was $6 per person (usually most restaurants would charge per pot rather than per person or serve it for free as part of the meal) and promptly served this to the entire table (apart from my husband and parents who declined it), despite most of us having already ordered the herbal tea (so we had two glasses of tea each). I drank some of the Long Jing tea in my glass, my kids didn't even drink the tea at all. My glass was not topped up. I only realised when the bill came that each person was charged $6 for this tea. They should at least have highlighted this on the set menu (only the herbal tea which cost $5 was indicated there). So I was charged $6 for drinking half a glass of tea which was never topped up and my kids were charged $6 each for tea that they never asked for and never drank.So despite the pretty good food, I only gave a 3-star rating as I was really disappointed with the service and felt somewhat cheated that they tried to profit from the drinks for serving a promotional set menu.My total bill was over $820 (including taxes and service charge) for a family of 6 adults and 6 kids because of the extra dishes such as the peking duck, dim sum and the unsatisfying overcharge for the drinks. Will be a while before I head back again, even though the food is not bad
4
We had a table booked for ten persons. The bill is in the thousand plus we later found out that the restaurant charged a $10 fee per person for the tableware. What? If they don't provide the tableware, then do they expect us to use our hands to eat? I mean no other countries in the world does that. You can only find it in Singapore who would also charge you for wet towels they purposely left on the table

It has been some time since I last visited Golden Peony. I came by the restaurant recently for a business lunch. The restaurant is located on the third floow of Conrad Centennial Hotel, which is located just opposite Suntec City – Convention Hall. The restaurant’s interior exudes class with high ceilings and a nicely appointed cream-colored interiors and wood panels. The table setting was classy with a nice serving plate and glass Chinese Tea cup.The executive chef of Golden Peony is a frequent guest chef on Mediacorp Channel 8 programmes which have a good following amongst TV audiences.Here are the highlights of my meal:- Appetiser: Pickled Vegetables with diced capsicum, black fungus and fried beancurd. Within this dish, I loved the fried beancurd bits, which is good. - Trio of Dimsum: Char Siew Pastry, Steamed Vegetable Dumpling and Steamed Scallop and Prawn Dumpling with braised sauce. Great presentation, as all is presented on a long plate. The char siew pastry is small and delicate. The scallop was fresh and below it is the prawn and meat dumpling. It’s drizzled in a starchy sauce which had a taste of superior stock. The vegetable dumpling was also good.- Steamed Soup in Whole Coconut. Soup had fish maw, dried scallop, fresh prawn, fresh scallop and mini abalone. This was the highlight of the meal. The soup is light and nourishing. I think ladies will love this soup. The seafood ingredients were also fresh and delicious.- Teriyaki Cod Fish, stir-fried celery, macadamia nuts, black fungus in crispy shell with a red wine sauce. The cod fish is well marinated and flavourful thanks to the teriyaki sauce. The stir fried vegetables on the side were also nice. I didn’t really like the red wine sauce which had a heady wine aroma when it was presented to the table, but I didn’t like the taste. - Fried Rice with crabmeat, carrots and cauliflower stem with char siew. This was nicely presented on a nice long oval plate. The fried rice had good ‘wok hei’ (breath of the fiery wok) and what’s unique was the diced cauliflower bits in the fried rice. The fried rice is good. The char siew was made in-house had some fatty layers. It was not bad. Just before serving dessert, we were served calamansi juice ina dainty glass flute. This help to cleanse the palate prior to having dessert.- Dessert: Avocado juice with Vanilla ice cream; Black Glutinous Rice with homemade Coconut and Deep fried sweet potato pastry. Great presentation, with the avocado juice and black glutinous rice presented in a nice cups. You can hold the cups and use the spoon to dig in or drink down the dessert. The avocado is nice and refreshing. Its light and smooth, and the texture is not thick unlike avocado smoothie. The vanilla ice cream is a nice touch and its nice!The restaurant used coconut ice cream to complement the black glutinous rice which is a nice touch. The deep fried sweet potato pastry was about the size of a ping pong ball. The skin was multi-layered and the inside was sweet and smooth. I could have eaten more if I could. The restaurant is perfect for business lunch, with good and attentive service provided by the staff, who change cutlery with every course and top up your Chinese tea without prompting. The food quality is good and I enjoyed my meal here.Recommended

the lobster mee sua is excellent. dim sum is tasty, yet not oily. however, directions to the restaurant are not prominent. went to the wrong lift lobby initially. service staff are polite.
5
Very good food in a restrained atmosphere. Mostly Chinese eating there, so I don't know where the Americans were. That's always a good sign.
5
The food is Hong Kong Chinese and was great, they altered the food slightly to accommodate gluten free, a great meal.
All the staff very friendly, efficient and helpful.
5
We had an excellent meal dictated by a set meal offering. Dining was in a private room with service being polite and professional.
4
Worth a visit especially if you are staying in the hotel or nearby in Suntec. Food is full of flavor and they even tune the portions and price for the single diner.
3
The places serves up an awesome ambiance along with a wonderful staff to compliment it. Although I must say this place is a big no no for people who do not enjoy authentic Chinese cuisine (PS: I did not enjoy it). They served soup with fish maw, fish dipped in soy sauce, lobster with a cup of noodles and everything was very well presented. Well all this said, the place served this 7 course meal for a whopping 120 bucks which is way too steep even for the service and food expected. Would not be visiting again because of the price but I recommend the place to those who have heavy wallets with a taste for Chinese foo
5
If you are staying at the Conrad Singapore you definitely need to reserve a table here for one evening and if you are visiting Singapore it is worth the time to visit the restaurant. The variety of food we had was excellent and the service was very attentive and helpful in working with us to choose the right dishes and spice
4
The cod fish I had is fresh, the fried carrot cake and char siew buns are up to standard. However, I think that the shark bone soup I had was a tad too salty. Overall, good service from the crew and good food, but price wise, it's probably not too nice to your wallet.
4
Had a business lunch at Golden Peony at Conrad International. Went for a set lunch - Fusion - which is a combination of Asian, Western and other types of food. It was a unique 8 course meal - from Washington Pranab, Abalone Soup, Cod Fish, Fried Rice and few others. Surrounded with fantastic setting plus professional service; Golden Peony is a perfect place whether it be a business lunch or romantic dinner. Depending on the order, the cost can be anywhere from reasonable to high - it's inside the hotel. Definitely be back to try other menu
3
We decided to eat here as we had been to the one in Hong Kong and the food had been very good. We were expecting the same level of food and service and I'm afraid we were disappointed with both. Food was average and 2 dishes were served cold, one of which noodles with prawn was swimming in oil. Not pleasant. The restaurant only had 4 occupied tables so capacity was at about 15%. We were put on a table right in the middle; everyone else was seated on the edge! We both asked for sparkling water and was given the more expensive individual bottle option. This seemed to be the policy although a large bottle between 2 would have been cheaper according to the drink list! We were also charged for the dips etc that they put on the table after we sat down. We didn't use them so were at a loss to understand the charge. I think that maybe a Monday night could mean that there was less staff front of house and in the kitchen which led to this disappointing visit
4
Great selection of food and very good service.
Ordered many duck dishes and very tasty.
Ate here with colleagues as we were all staying at the hotel.
5
We ate at the restaurant for convenience the price is fairly expensive for singapore but the food and service is top notch.
5
Have been invited to Golden Peony by a business contact. The best Beijing Duck i have ever had in Singapore. Also the waste selection of Dim Sum (for dinner) was impressive.
Service impecable. Highly recommend for high end Cantonese cuisine.
5
Having dim sum at Golden Peony is an exquisite experience touching on the food, service and ambience. Siew Mai topped with thinly sliced scallop and caviar, chive dumplings with skin chewy to the bite but yet not sticky or difficult to bite through, fried beancurd skin prawn paste that is done just nice and crispy but not oily...char siew pau that is not overpoweringly sweet or salty. The taste is delicate and the presentation vey well executed. Service is attentive and non intrusive. The ambience is cosy and classy, a very well maintained place after 10 years. Recommended if you want to be pampered; those who prefer dishes done more salty, sweeter or oilier will not like this
5
As a regular guest to the Conrad SIngapore, I have not eaten at Golden Peony for some time and decided to take some business associates there for lunch. I was surprised to find a large menu with great selections. This is an exceptional restaurant with very good food and high quality service. Its a must when you visit SIngapore next...
5
This is a restaurant for people who want real Hong Kong/ cantonese food. I had the good fortune to be invited there by a local Chinese friend and customer. The chef prepared a menu chosen by our host and it was the best Chinese food that I have ever tasted. Many small courses of excellent Chinese food. We invited the chef into our private dining area to congratulate and thank him. If the regular menu food is any where near as good you are in for a treat. We had some excellent French wine which complemented the food superbly

It was a disappointing dining experience for us in Golden Peony on 30 July 2014. Both my wife & me were very much looking forward to bring one of our closest friends here together with his family, for celebrating his birthday. As Conrad is a world class hotel & Golden Peony a multi awards winning restaurant, I felt this should be the right selection, as I am very particular when bringing my guests to eat with us. Not so much on the venue, but the quality of the food taste. At the start, It was great as I made my reservation with Jenny and her service was good! As we reached the restaurant, we were also greeted by her and brought us to the table which was arranged for us. Without prompting, she allocated 2 stands for us to put our stuff! Along the way from entrance, multi awards even dated last year were presented very nicely. The menu indicating our chosen package was very nicely decorated, even the tables, chairs, cutlery are of high quality. The art pieces also helped to make the ambience great. However, it was quite a surprise that we were the only customers, except for one private dining area. Once my guests arrived, we were served the complimentary birthday buns, a nice gesture from the restaurant. From here, everything went down hill. I ordered the Onyx Set Menu ($68++ per person)- The first dish, Deep-fried Bacon Rolled with Asparagus, topped with Mayonnaise and Dried Shaved Bonito Flakes Chilled Sea Jelly with Ginger Purée, felt plain. Even worse, 2nd dish, Double-boiled Chicken Soup with Morel Mushroom,Whole Conpoy filled in Chinese Marrow, felt diluted. 3rd dish was the worst, Sautéed and Golden-fried Fillet of Grouper, served with Seasonal Vegetables- The same fillet in school canteen would taste even better. After a couple more dishes, to be fair, there was one dish which I hope the rest of the dishes could have the same quality of taste- Braised Ee-Fu Noodles with Crab Meat, served with ‘Choy Sum’. It could have been a much better evening, as all of us expected great tasting food but the food was well below average among the local Chinese restaurants
5
We have had several fantastic lunches here. The food is excellent and the service is faultless. Work your way round the dim sum, or get advice from the staff. The bar is separate, use the one by the pool for a great view. I'd suggest that if you want a coffee after, try the pool bar or the new coffee bar outside the hotel. Both great for people watching
3
We liked the fact that it was in the hotel and convenient -we were exhausted from a very busy Saturday. Sadly, or perhaps appropriate for early January, Golden Peony was 10% full. The appetisers were a nice touch - sugared cashew nuts followed by vegetable and aubergine spring rolls.Because we don't share food they totally confused our order and my prawns and mango in sweet and sour sauce arrived with steamed rice about 30 minutes before my now-starving husband received his meal - chicken with cashew nuts and chilli. The hungriest of us all - my daughter - had to wait even longer. This was definitely a case of mis-communication we have no doubt. Considering the restaurant was almost empty made it worse - perhaps they were on skeleton staff for the holidays and couldn't speak English? Waiting for my glass of French merlot was the classic comedy of errors. The first bottle brought by the waitron was Sauvignon Blanc, next up was Cabernet and last of all was my glass of Merlot. Wait - it does get worse - for my hungry daughter. The incorrect meal was FINALLY brought to her (which she subsequently puked up). Not spare ribs like she had ordered..... How could an international hotel have staff on duty that are unable to serve in English? French would have helped a lot - my daughter is fluent, but communicating in Mandarin would have been impossible. Our daughter subsequently worked out that Asians "share" their food and its communal eating all the way, whereas our Eurocentric way confused them in its selfishnes

In Singapore fine dining establishments are so numerous that the citizens can complain that they cannot keep up with the new ones that keep opening.One dining place that has kept loyal diners happy is Golden Peony in the Conrad Hotel.This restaurant combines clash dining ambience (for the perfect quiet business meal) with fine cuisine done in personal portions.Noted will be the golden fried lobster on a bed of spicy bean crumbs and the super savoury salt baked quail with taro chips.They also conduct frequent wine themed dinners and it pays to be on their email list to catch these events. Great value for money events where you get to sample nice wines paired with their dishes at wallet friendly prices
3
We booked this for our anniversary dinner and sadly were very disappointed, the service is very good, but the food is lacking in flavour and portion size, I have never before seen Chinese food done like Nouvel Cuisine
4
The set lunch meals are fairly value for money's worth. Cantonese cuisine served with a western presentation on some dishes. Waiting staff courteous & attentive. Been here many times for business lunches & will keep coming back.
4
Golden poney restaruant serve high standard of chinese food, the price is high, but most of the dishes is nice. Their fried mee sua is nice, but small portion.
4
This is a distinctive restaurant and the best in the Conrad Hotel. Excellent food , large variety and outstanding service. The waitress recommandations fit perfect to our taste. I loved the food and the atmosphere.
4
One of my favourite Chinese restaurant and my usual choice to bring overseas friends for fine Cantonese food. At lunch service, dim sum is served but expect more refined and exquisite fares than the usual shrimp and meat dumplings available everywhere
4
We were attending a conference at Suntec and decided to walk across the road for a nice lunch at Golden peony. I really shouldn't be bringing 3 hongkong associates to a cantonese restaurant here as they may rather eat local food, but this was 1 of the quieter places for a discussion near suntecOrdered the lunch set which was of decent value at $48, plus an extra side of roast duck and pork. The latter was very good, and deemed authentic by my HK associates. The set started with a duo of dim sum, which was ok. The doubled boiled soup was delicious. The crispy noodles was average, and the dessert of hot sweet almond puree was not as ok - i prefer something cold and not so sweet for dessertBefore dessert, they even had a palate cleanser of lime juice, which was a nice touchOverall it was a commendable effort but didn't blow me awa
5
The beautiful Conrad Centennial Singapore is one of many excellent hotels in Singapore, for the business or leisure traveler, a hotel that offers in general a range of really first class products......having stepped off a 12 hour trip from London, I was keen to dine well but not venture to far away my new base, and was delighted to find out that the in-house Chinese restaurant, Golden Peony had been booked for dinner. The dining room is very elegant, cream style table cloths with comfortable chairs......by no means a big place, well compared to many others, the 100-seater room still has an intimate feel. Our dinner started rolling along, with the delightful Beijing / Peking Duck followed by a number of nice dishes, but of the those the Lobster was superb........with the dessert to top the dining off......now I know Cantonese dining and desserts are not really that iconic, but this was quite brilliant.......Chilled cream of Avocado with Ice cream, would not normally get me excited, but wow what amazing flavors..so delicate and joyful........Overall the meal was one of the better I have had in a very good Cantonese restaurant, which combines style, good service, flavors and a cozy design into a first class experience.....
5
We had dinner at the Golden Peony which is the Cantonese restaurant within the Conrad hotel. They have an a la carte menu as well as 4-5 pre-fixe menus. We chose one of the more interesting pre-fixe choices and were very glad with our decision. The food, though a bit pricy, was exquisitely prepared and the service was excellent. Our waiter was named Esther and attended to our every need during our meal. She explained each course as it was presented and never let our teacups go empty. During our dinner, Griselda from the front desk, found us in the restaurant and presented us with an anniversary gift of a bride and groom teddy bear. This is a simple gesture but this type of attention is what separates good from great service. We are very happy we celebrated our anniversary at the Golden Peony
3
The Golden Peony has great waiting staff but the food and experience is not amazing. Besides the nouveau cuisine minimalist servings (which is not necessarily a bad thing), it's just not good value. They could do without the overly loud Chinese music blaring through the PA system. Sorry but this restaurant is just not good value
3
Returned to the Golden Peony for the first time in a few years. Seems not too much has changed. Much of the food in the set menu we had seemed like a modern take on traditional food, sort of Chinese fusion. It's a decent restaurant, but there are many other restaurants in the area which are much better. Fusion doesn't cut the mustard, go for the real deal
5
Just loved the food - everything we ordered was delicious! We tried several different dishes and everything was wonderful!
5
The restaurant is located within the hotel building and is serving my favorite Chinese cuisine - Cantonese. It offers a lot of choices and the ambiance is great. The servers are all courteous and willing to please.
4
I love Dim Sums and this restaurant has a great Dim Sum menu at Lunch time. Service is really great and prices were fair. I would definitely go back.
5
A real treat, asian food like I have never experienced before. So elegant and complex. Yes it's expensive but the restaurant is beautiful and the standards are extremely high so you kind of expect that.
A special occasion or expenses account kind of place :)
3
We found the restaurant to lack character and the menu was limited. What was served was ok but I suggest that you can do a lot better elsewhere
5
The food is superb... Authentic Chinese with a hint of modern fusion!
4
We chose to eat here one night. The food is very good quality but is a little expensive.
5
We went for a business lunch but ended up with a meal for the record books. Our host was a native who knows the language and ordered with exquisite taste. I highly advise you do the same if you can. The service was fine: prompt, casual, friendly and professional but nothing exceptional. On the other hand, the food -- a selection of 5 Dim Sum dishes -- was simply outstanding! Be sure to call ahead for a reservation....this place is in high demand
2
Restaurants without windows inside hotels are always a tough sell at the best of times and Golden Peony comes up well short.The food is presented and served terribly and the staff are surly and entirely disinterested in anything you care to ask for. Would not go back though choice
5
A lot of the Chinese dishes in the UK are Hong Kong cantonese in origin, so the menu does not hold as many suprises as some of the small places in food halls around the town. However, the presentation and taste here are much different than I am used to and both were a real pleasure. My colleague and I enjoyed every second of it. Staff were smiling and happy which also helped. It's a hotel restaurant so not cheap, they never are. Certainly somewhere I will eat happily again
5
the best authentic cantonese hong kong food in singapore! SUPER delicious DIM SUM even at 10.30pm!!!
5
Try it, you won't be disappointed.
More old school Chinese
5
It was in the hotel we stayed in and it was really convenient. Nice food and service was excellent!

Tim Sum Heaven.

Tried durng business lunches only...to rich for my diet ;-)

OK lah!
5
I am not particularly fond of eating dim sum or chinese food in Singapore because Hong Kong standards are much higher. Golden Peony is one of the few Chinese restaurants that can rival the high standards of upscale HK restaurants. The food and presentation is exquisitely refined and makes dining a super pleasant experience. I don't get thirsty bouts and it says greatly about the quality of food. This is a great place for business entertainment or to splurge on a special occasion !

We were in the Conrad for NYE 2011/2012.....so thought that we would do the NYE dinner at the hotel resturant....relatively expensive at mediocre quality.....the Chinese an Four Seasons where we were a few years ago was definetly much better.....not to speak of countless SGP stand alone restaurants - which are great and plent

The caption sums up the experience. It is supposed to be one of the 'best' Cantonese cuisine restaurants in Singapore but it was far from it. They served me up a no meat, sea food meal and for my friends a meat dominated one and I have had better from a street vendor in Sham Shui Po in Hong Kong. Seriously, over rated, over priced rubbish. Do not waste your hard earned money here

Was there on Christmas day and was choosing between having the buffet at Oscar's or chinese dinner at Golden peony and chose the latter.Food was abov average but i do not like the hot and sour soup. I had tasted better somewhere. the menu is very extensive and asked Winnie for recommendation and she recommended the beef cheek which is very nice (I love fatty food). However, this dish is not for those who do not like fatty food.Had the smoked duck with mango and felt that the dish is pretty good as the duck did go down pretty well with the mango, a refreshing taste. The spinach tofu is average. I had the fried mee sua too but feels that its a way bit too dry for my liking.Had the mango pudding with pomelo and mango puree. Very nice indeed.The service staff, especially Winnie, were very attentive throughout the dinner. The price is on the high side though. We paid S$220 for the entire meal. Do take note that HSBC card entitles you to a 15% discount. But they did give me a S$20 voucher to spend at any outlets located with Conrad
