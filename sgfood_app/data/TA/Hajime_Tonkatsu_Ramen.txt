My partner and I had a very pleasant experience at Hajime. The customer service was good. I ordered a Premium Pork Loin Tonkatsu and a scoop of sesame ice cream. The pork loin is very reasonably priced, and the pork was crispy yet tender and juicy on the inside. The rice was done fluffy and not too moist. I was also given a bowl and the staff taught me how to grind my own sesame and mix some tonkatsu sauce. I also thoroughly enjoyed the sesame ice cream. It was fragrant and the taste was not too overpowering.The sesame ice cream pairs well with the tonkatsu. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience and I will return to try other dishes. Thumbs u

My wife and I visited this place for dinner on a Thur night during the Sep school holidays, around 6:30pm.Location and Parking================Embedded within the quiet landed property enclave in Serangoon Garden, the restaurant is located within the MyVillage suburban mall. The nearest MRT station is Serangoon MRT and you can reach Serangoon Garden via bus number 315 and 317 after a 10-15min ride.There is free but limited parking in MyVillage. Rates are not cheap:MON-SUN, incl Public Holidays: $2.00/hr at all times.URA streetside parking are available along the streets immediately surrounding MyVillage (60 cents per 30min. Per-minute charging if you use the URA/HDB parking app). Finally, there's free roadside parking in the streets further from the village centre, in front of the landed properties. Layout and ambience===================+ Air-conditioned+ Fairly spacious, high-ceiling+ Nice modern decor+ Clean toilets in MyVillageFood====The restaurant is run by Chef Tan-San, the first Singaporean chef who brought Tonkatsu to Singapore 25 years ago (according to a signboard at the restaurant's entrance). So we had high expectations.Dishes we had:- Pork Loin Tonkatsu set ($18.50) - came with a 5-inch wide piece of breadcrumb-fried pork loin, rice, miso soup, pickled cabbage appetizer, 2 slices of water melon. We didn't order the Premium version ($21.90) of the Pork Loin set as it was similar except that the meat was fatter and contains more marbling- Tonkatsu Ramen ($15.50) - came with a slightly smaller piece of meat, but well-cooked too. The ramen soup was flavourful and delicious.The Tonkatsu in both dishes actually didn't seemed very marinated, though reasonably soft in texture. But they did provide sesame seeds and Tonkatsu dipping sauce for customers to grind, mash and apply as much as we want onto the meat. The dipping sauce was great as rice gravy too!+ Free-flow rice and cabbage - we just need to bring our plates to the front counter to get more of the cold and fresh shredded cabbage. We ate 3 bowls of that alone!The full price menu is in the attached photos. They seem to have daily promotions, where specific items may go for almost half-price, e.g. the roasted edame beans was going to $2.50 versus the usual $4.50.Service=======Ordering is via paper chit sheets, submitted and paid at the counter before food is prepared.Service was crisp and prompt. Food was served within 15min.The place was mostly empty when we were there, possibly because it was a weekday during a school holiday period. But I must say it's also not very visible from the mall corridors as it was hidden within a corner. Overall, an authentic, delicious, and not-too-expensive Japanese meal

Tried for the first time with my family. My kids enjoyed the ramen. I like the Shabu Shabu ramen especially. Might go back again

Celebrated my teenage son's birthday here yesterday as he loves the tonkatsu here. The staff here were really friendly and when I made a joke that I let my son order the most expensive item on the menu, they took the initiative and surprised him with a nice scoop of sesame seed ice-cream on the house! The tonkatsu here is tender and juicy and fried just right! Won't go wrong with the premium loin here

This canteen-style eatery is located at the small My Village mall in Serangoon Gardens. Like some dim sum restaurants and Din Tai Fung), you check the order form boxes. But here, payment is taken in advance of delivery. The service was polite, helpful (informative) and efficient. Hajime was strongly recommended by my nephew (a real foodie) who assured us that the premium Tonkatsu (premium pork loin set S$19.90) was excellent â€“ and my son loves Katsu. This did not disappoint. We also ordered the salmon don ($16.90), cha shu ramen (really tasty! $11.90), agedashi tofu ($3.90) and Gyoza ($6.90). The matcha ice cream (with a drizzle of stewed red bean) was huge at a very reasonable $3.90 - this was twice the size of the portions served at Sushi Tei and every bit as good!Good place to go for a light lunch. I was surprised that, at 1:30pm, the place was relatively empty. But, this worked to our advantage.

This is a restaurant that serves comfort food at affordable price for the family. It's the traffic around serangoon gardens that is the bane. My son is 'addicted' to the cabbage salad and dressing while I like the pickles and tonkatsu sauce that goes well with the rice. We'll be back to try the ramen

Tonkatsu is one of my husband's favourite dishes so we were thrilled when Hajime opened up in our neighbourhood. We go there at least once a month for his fix. My husband would go for the tonkatsu and me the katsudon and we are never disappointed. The tonjiru miso soup that comes with the set is also delish!!

Arguably the best in Singapore, the Premium Pork Loin and Miso Katsu are to die for. The penko has a audible crunch, and stays crispy long after it has left the kitchen. I also really enjoyed the rice, which was fragrant and fluffy. The food screams of high quality, and at $19.90, the Premium Pok Loin is a steal. I have been back many times over, and Highly recommend this place to any one who is seeking quality Japanese food

My wife loves the Salmon Don here while I almost always choose the Katsu Don. We eat here when we crave comfort food.There's a special festive Tonkatsu set for the Christmas season that is delicious. It comes with free flow of rice and salad, though the served portions are enough to fill the tummy. I am hoping that the set becomes a regular item in the menu. The staff are attentive and warm. Soon Hui, the Director, is a lovely host who welcomes the diners. To avoid the queue (it is a small restaurant), come early for dinner (before 6pm on weekends)

I chanced upon this while looking for a nice relaxing lunch venue. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor of Myvillage. There is ample road side and on site parking off peak.The tonkatsu was heavenly and succulent. Reminded me of the Tonkatsu places in Japan. Ramen is not bad too. There is no GST and no service charge so what you see is what you pay. There's free flow rice and cabbage, like Japan, and you can ask for it at the counter. Same for hot green tea. It was also fun to grind your own sesame seed and mix your own tonkatsu dip. Pricing was reasonable and I look forward to coming back. No special weekday lunch set etc. The menu and pricing is same everyday.Closed from 3 to 6.
