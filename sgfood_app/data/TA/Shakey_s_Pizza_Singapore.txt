Popped in for lunch at Liang Court. The food was very nice and inexpensive. We tried pizzas, pasta and Shepards pie. All were lovely. If you are staying at Somerset Liang Court you get 10% off which was nice. Would recommend for lunch .

After taking a few bites of the vegetarian pizza I realized that the smell of stale, melted cheese was coming from my pizza! The cheese had melted leaving an oily residue...Promptly got up, paid from my meal and told the cashier I expected better. She made some vague comments about giving this feedback to the management...A global chain that puts pizza in its name should at least ensure that the key ingredients in the pizza meet basic standards of quality

As all Shakey's fans know, the deciding factor whether or not this franchise will meet its global standards is on its chicken and mojos (fried potatoes) meal. Glad to say it did! The only difference was they're serving the mojos on a separate dish. Staff was prompt and the service is okay. We do hope it won't change
