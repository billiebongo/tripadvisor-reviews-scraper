more than 40mins waiting in hunger (average waiting time is about half hour)
other customer who came later got her meal first because she called and made arrangements?? how about customers who queued?
unfair & unprofessional service leaving patient customers in hunger!

Interesting menu though a bit pricey. But would definitely say itâ€™s worth a visit! Friendly staff & good ambiance at this one as well.

We loved eating here as it's challenging finding GF options in Singapore. There were multiple options of which all were good. A favorite was the GF waffles but the pasta and quinoa salad were also very good.

Love the extensive menu of eastern and western dishes made with wholesome ingredients that are vegan-friendly and/or vegetarian. Absolutely love the Dumpling soup with spinach noodles, a definite must-try.

Offers a variety of Asian and western food. Have eaten here countless times and the food quality never disappoint me. Quiet ambience great for solo time or catch up with friends. Service rating is average because it is a semi self service concept: order and pay at counter, cutlery and a number will be given. Staff will bring the food to you based on your number as it is free seating

Had dinner here. My cold pressed Kale Apple Juice was a nice "starter" to clear my palate before my baked pasta main course. I love the option of being able to switch to a gluten-free, quinoa based pasta instead. Patience required here as service is slower, but the food is worth the wait. Lots of seating and not noisy. Will be back again on a more regular basis

Stopped by during lunch on Monday. The cafe has good variety on menu. The service is considered slow as the cafe was not nearly half occupied. My order took more than 20 mins to be served. Tasted great however.Good atmosphere for afternoon coffee/tea. Good cappuccino. Will come back again when I have spare time in hand

Ordered the mushroom aglio olio with added garlic (supposedly for extra flavour) but food was really bland. Also ordered a bai mu dan tea which cost $5.50. Came not in a pot but in a small cup without the tea leaves or tea bag, like it had been brewed elsewhere and dispensed into the cup. Way overpriced. This will be my first and last time here

This is my fourth time visiting Real Food Cafe. I have been impressed every time. I appreciate their selection of Gluten/Soy/Wheat free products. The food is always fresh and presented with superb quality. I have tried the omelettes, pancakes, pumpkin soup and others. I highly recommend the Original Banana Pancakes #Silly.

If you are looking for healthy food choices this is the place to go. It is vegan friendly and their rice milk ice cream is pretty good.

Weekday Dinner. Place was nowhere close to capacity.
To save time, we ordered the same dish. Unfortunately, was still made to wait more than 30 minutes.
Overpriced. Understaffed. Unimpressive.

Tried the Spicy organic mushroom Aglio Olio with additional garlic for improved flavor. It was terribly average. The pasta was dry and not spicy. Please also note the price is S$10.80 and not S$7.80 as indicated on the menu.

This is how you do vegetarian food - full of flavour, filling, satisfying, fresh and priced right! Stumbled on this place near the Novena MRT and it is fantastic! So many choices and so well-prepared! The Dumpling soup is light and filling.

Stopped by for a quick lunch.Quick to take the order, they gave me a basket with napkin and utensils and told me to take a seat. Food showed up shortly after, piping hot and quite tasty.I had the organic fried noodles with capsicum, cabbage and shiitake mushrooms. I'll eat here agai

As others have mentioned, the wait to order, pay and then get your food is quite long. I've tried a few dishes, most were fresh, tasty and satisfying. I was very excited to see GF waffles on the menu and after being assured they were GF, Orgran brand, I ordered them. There must have been some kind of cross contamination as I was quite ill for the next few days. Since then I've stuck with salads to be on the safe side. Yesterday I ordered the garlic and rosemary hash brown. I was so disappointed. It was potato hash, not a hash brown. I can mash and fry a potato myself. I wanted a proper hash brown that takes some time and a hot pan to make well. I will be back to try other dishes, but will be cautious

Being a vegetarian, this place is god sent. Although, it is not exactly wallet friendly, however, the food is very good. We tried the Dumpling Soup, Baked brown rice with cheese, apple juice (Highly recommended). One thing you can be rest assured, the fruit juices are freshly prepared. The ambiance and the overall decor is also very green and trendy. One weird thing we thought was, you have to place and pay for your first order before you proceed to the dining area. Not sure what is the rationale

We waited more than 45minutes for our food to arrive. other dishes arrived slowly. we ordered 3 sandwiches. if management continues with this service i am sure this restaurant will close eventually. please take note of this. other customers asked for refund and left. we were patient enough to wait. only one sandwich came other two sandwiches will be 1hr late

When I say clean, I mean that the ingredients are wholesome and I don't have any qualms when my kids eat there with me. No MSG, no cheap recycled vegetable oils and of course as much as they can, they use organic ingredients. My family and I dine there very frequently and the waitresses are friendly esp. Kirara :) who always makes us feel very welcomed when we arrive the Cafe. We especially love the Mushroom Soupm Pumpkin Soup, Classic Green and the Kombu Soup. If you love Chinese food, you should try their Dumping Noodles or their Mushroom Noodles. Overall, eating there always feels right. I hope the Cafe will continue to keep up their standards and continue to thrive!

Superb Vege Cafe, good and healthy choice can be found in real food!Steamed dumpling is tasty, Freid Quinoa is a must try, and mushroom noodle is good! Nice Lavender soy milk! So many good food to name...However, should avoid order the soup item (clear soup/mushroom soup), not so yummy.Even though the waiting time could be long and especially during peak hours, lunch/dinner time, but its worth to wait

Nice place, pretty food plating, impressive collection of organic and whole packaged foods. Taste just OK, a bit pricey and service is just too long

Am sitting waiting for my food for an eternity. Thinking of going into the kitchen to cook it myself.
Service here is unbelievably slow.

I was just there with my celiac sister. She wanted to order the Gluten-Free soup, but was shocked that the bread that comes with it was made of WHEAT flour! I told them that when one orders GF soup, one expects the bread to be GF too. Do you know what their answer to that was? "It is on the side, you don't have to eat it." Incredible! Can you even believe that?!   It is obvious that these people are merely jumping onto the GF bandwagon for profits - there is no COMMITMENT to the GF principle at all. As a celiac, would you trust that you are truly getting GF food? In fact, can you trust that you are even getting organic stuff, when they are so lacking in commitment

It took over an hour for any food to arrive after we ordered and my partners about 20 mins after mine arrived. Noodles were ok, a bit soft and broth was bland. There was so many different types of vegetables in the dumpling and it had all been chopped finely. Taste and texture were great! Won't be coming back again unfortunately. Don't think I can face an hours' wait for food..

Quick meal before going to the city. The menu is all organic the vermicelli I ordered was good and gentle. Smoothie was delicious (feeling good made of bananas, raw choc and soy milk). My wife's baked rice turned out to be pasta. Anyway, that was ok as well.Very few customers outside the lunch hours, the service was so and so.There are plenty of books to read if you get bored :

Real food cafe is located at Novena and nearby the station. It is very easy to find. I have tried many organic restaurant before. Real food is not the first one. I order Almond Milk and Sweet potato salad. Overall, food quality is good. However, it is below my expectation. I think it can be more delicious with their quality of the ingredient. Anyhow, they have a good variety of food to choose from. If you are looking for clean food and willing to pay the premium, please give real food cafe a try. My expectation on food might be higher than the average

I was recommended this place by a colleagues and I used to frequent this place often for lunch on weekdays. The food is fresh and the menu offers a good variety of vegetarian organic dishes. The waiting time for the food once ordered is long but I guess it is freshly made hence the delay. The prices are above average but I would not complain on it as well.

I LOVE this place. Very conveniently located, lovely setting, I really love the big wooden tables and the calm atmosphere. Perfect place to bring a book or a pen and a notebook in the evening to enjoy leisure time while you eat really good food.Great menu with unusual recipes that I love (beet burger...). I have been there many, many times and there was only one dish that I tried and didn't like (the portobello mushroom burger). 100% vegetarian meals, which is a real delight to me.I would strongly advise not to come at lunch time if you are in a rush because it is very busy so waiting time is long. However it is clearly stated in the restaurant's flyer that this is not a fast-food chain and I have witnessed some customers being extremely rude to the staff while asking for refunds because of the waiting time, but seriously I'd rather have a good place to eat good food even if it means I have to wait longer - if you are in a hurry, you might as well just eat somewhere else... the only time I came for lunch, I had to wait 45 mn to get my pizza - but at least, it was the best pizza I ever had. On the other hand, service is quick when not during rush hours (they have taken as little as 5 minutes to serve me several times).Clearly expensive for a cafe compared to what you usually pay in Singapore but once again it is such good food that I think it is worth it (though still a bit disappointed that prices have increased and that the cold pressed juices are so expensive, they are delicious but ~8 SGD per juice is really a lot). Anyway, still much cheaper than what I would have to pay in France for that kind of food, so enjoying it while I can...Friendly staff. Lovely little organic shop inside the restaurant. Would definitely recommend. Only sad thing is that there are no desserts on the menu and that some drinks are out of stock for several months (ex: no cocoa powder for at least three months = impossible to get any smoothie containing it)

The staff are friendly, remembered me the second time I came in since I eat here for lunch or dinner. Their dumplings are good, fresh and moist, a must try. The salad with some wedges of potato and a semi hard boiled egg is good as well. I also tried their fried tofu which I wouldn't recommend if you like bland friend tofu with a strange sour sauce. This place is a vegan/vegetarian place which serves organic food.

If you are looking for healthy vegetarian cuisine that tastes amazing then this is the place. I have been here a number of times and can only praise them for consistently providing tasty food. I recommend the Chickpea salad and any of their soups. Always fresh and tasty. The service friendly but a little slow. But I can accept because it's so good.
