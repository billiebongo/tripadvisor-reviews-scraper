I love this restaurant. The clean, crisp decoration makes you feel relaxed and ready to eat waayyyy too much delicious Greek food. Every dish I've tried has been delicious. Highly recommend for client lunches.

Great food and ambience. Love the atmosphere and service. Would definitely recommend. All the dishes were very tasty and well presented

First time trying out Greek cuisine, the experience was pretty dufferent. Ambience was good and the restaurant focuses on seafood. Tried their salt baled fish, octopus and some sides. However, price is pretty steep and flavor too strong for my tastebuds. Could consider if you would like to try out authentic Greek cuisins

Visited today and had TarmosalataMelizanosalataFyllo wrapped fetaGreek sardinesGreek stuffed squidSalt baked sea bream Kotopoulo souvlakiDorper lamb cutletsBaklavaGreek fried donuts... so basically had a really wide selection from the menu across different meats and courses. Everything was absolutely delicious and supported by gorgeous ambiance and great service. Really enjoyed our visit and would gladly go again to try some dishes again and also explore the rest of the menu we haven’t tried yet! (Generous) Meal for 5 without drinks came to about $400 so it’s a bit pricey but very worth it!

After a friendly welcome and an enjoyable starter a plate of emaciated and stringy mussels was delivered in an over-salted sauce. The chicken main course included one length of barbecued chicken and Greek fried potatoes, aka chips. The wine list appeared rather highly priced for the quality on offer. Sad to have to report in such gloomy terms.

My aunt and husband came to visit and I wanted to let them try a different cuisine. Decided to bring them to Alati as I had a few work lunches and dinner there and the food was awesome. Love the dips, the grilled octopus and the yoghurt. The food is amazing
2
I went there on 23rd December, for the 2nd time after 6 months. Regretfully things dramatically changed in time. All the food was extremely oily. Portion were smaller and more expensive. Service was really poor, even thought late evening so no longer full. The couple in front of me spent the full dinner just waving hands to attract the attention of a waiter! When I got the bill, I asked if they changed the chef and the waitress said no...since I stated that I can see a big difference from the past, she confessed that the chef was on leave and only the sous chef in house....Regardless, we paid full time. I will never go back and neither recommend it
5
We were 6 pax for dinner on last week.Amazing food experience!We got a lot of different starters to share: tsazitki, tarama, peas purée, octopus, shrimps... and then we ordered a fish - the catch of the day...It was delicious! So yummy!Regarding the service, our guys were definitely the best ones! It’s so rare in Singapore that we have to highlight it!Thanks Alari Team, our night was perfect

great service with great food. we had 3 course lunch set at $37.50 each. grill chicken with own made fries is a must try
4
Three course lunch set.
Have the option to choose few for each.
Mine is not bad.
I like them and tastes not bad.
Price wise reasonable for a lunch set
They have a very Greek style decoration and their olive oil is awesome.
5
Visited during a weekday, the dishes are authentic and fresh.
Definitely would visit the restaurant again.

First rate Greek restaurant located on Amoy Street, on the cusp of the Central Business District (CBD). Lovely decor. Tasty food. Lots of veggie options too.

I had heard so many wonderful comments through the years and while I lived in Malaysia, I just hasn't managed to get to Alati during my Singapore visits. The Greek community in Singapore was raving about it (tough crowd!!!), the expats and business people were raving about it and expectations were through the roof!Do when the time came, I did go with my daughter finally!What a feast!Reservations was an easy breezy and then the heartfelt welcome of Yanni! All was wonderful until I tasted the taramosalata..... then the time stopped, a whole new level of awesomeness...mind you, I am greek myself and have eaten taramosalata on hundreds times on islands, villages and taverns for 4 decades! This one was a gold medal one! And then the sardines came... what??!!! What a recipe that was!! And the Dakos!!! And the mussels lasted 5 minutes under my daughters hands! Full already came the lukumades with ice cream and honey and chocolate and we would gave stayed through the night if we could! Yanni going from table to table greeting and taking care of people as was the staff. Real authentic Greek atmosphere, design, experience!!Thank you!!
5
After spending 10 days in Bali we went for a 2 days stop-over to Singapore. We were urged to eat greek food so we went to Alati. Everything in this place was amazing!! The Greek food (greek octopus is DEVINE indeed.. so is a must, tarama and mousaka also.. mmmm YUMMY) the Greek people (go there and ask for the Greek co-owner) and of course the unique Greek hospitality!!! Deserts were also a very pleasant surprise I suggest go there and taste everything ♥️
5
This was such a great experience! Amazing food, good wine, authentic Greek design. We felt very welcomed, like we came home :) the owner seems to be a great guy as well. Totally recommend. As a bonus - great Greek olive in on tables - loved it!

We arrive at Noon last Friday and settled in nicely as early birds. We decided to go with the set lunch thinking it would be relatively expedient. While the first course came relatively quickly, we had a long wait for the mains and had to remind the staff on several occasions. In comparison to other Greek restaurants in the city, I would say this one lacked the owner's personal touches of engagement with clients.
5
Beautiful simple decor in old shop house. Food is cut above most other Greek restaurants in Singapore. We had the salted baked bass and shared dips and starters. Excellent taste, presentation and well timed completion. Can’t comment on dessert as we were too full to eat. Price reflects the quality of the meal and service(read not cheap). Parking on the street is abut difficult but multi story and open air carpark within walking distance.
4
There are only a handful of Greek restaurants in Singapore and fewer good ones. Came upon this place while looking for a lunch place in Amoy Street and decided to give it a try based on the decor.I am glad we did. We tried out the set lunch menu, and it really delivered in spades. The starter platter was delicious and wholesome, and the choice of mains were diverse. The portions were good and the taste delicious- special mentions: the anchovy patties, the dips, the minced berg eggplant and the chicken skewer kebabs.Excellent place for casual business/office lunches.Revisit likelihood : next time I crave Greek for lunch
5
One of my favourite Greek restaurant in Singapore. Love the cosy Santorini feel restaurant, the grilled octopus, fyllo wrapped feta with honey & the fried mini doughnut with chocolate sauce are all so yummy!
Highly recommended.
3
Been to Alati many times. Loves the dips, they are really good! Selection of Greek wine is wonderful... it's reasonably priced as well! I will definitely go back again!
5
When you enter Alati restaurant, you feel that you entered a natural sea cave in one of Greece's magnificent islands! Then you have the amazing experience to be served delicious dishes prepared with impeccable care and talent. It's really rare to find such places outside Greece or Cyprus!This restaurant is a gem in the centre of Singapore
5
A truly amazing GREEK hospitality in Singapore.If you are looking for authentic Greek cuisine, good selection of Greek wines, a beautiful spot, great ambiance; amazing service... Alati is THE restaurant!And if you are lucky, you get to be charmed by the Chef Ioannis; a super nice guy who served up the most delicious Greek cuisine.#yummiliciou

The lunch main course offerings are good, probably want to avoid the spinach risotto starter as it's drowning in oil. Also for a lunch time crowd, the time it took to receive meal >45min just doesn't make sense. The service now that was surprisingly downright bad. The staff clearly lack leadership and incentive to perform. The female mainland bartender couldn't care less to help her colleagues when they were swamped. Morale of entire wait staff must be low and probsbly reflects deficiencies of managemen
4
We visited Alati as was a restaurant in the Eat Singapore book and we wanted to try it! The decor and atmosphere was superb, making you feel like you were having a meal in Greece.The menu was quite small for mains, and on the pricey side. Most of the menu was seafood, with a few meat options. The starters were delicious and we had the pita, with Tzatziki and some honey fried feta. For mains, we had moussaka and stuffed squid. The moussaka was served with beef, rather than lamb, and lots of potato which produced a strange flavour. The stuffed squid was interesting, but not sure i would order it again.A very good wine list was accompanying the meal, all wines from Greece and the menu explained their origins. Overall, a good restaurant, but be aware of the price and options on the menu before arriving
3
Complimentary bread was crispy and chewy, comes with sundried yogurt sauce and olive oil over sundried tomato / balsamic vinegar / salt. Balsamic vinegar stuck to the plate though.Filo is sweet with a creamy inside, having a sweet tooth dessert taste. Puffy pastry.Sardine was fishy, inconsistent with the sardine tail texture (some crispy some soft). Sauce hidden by the fishy taste.Cod roe was pretty fishy too, the sides (egg, tea leaves, onions) that came with it didn't help much too. The bread served was tasty, puffy similar to a naan.Lamb rack was cook perfectly, seasoned well, moist and tender! The fries that came with it however were soggy and boring.Greek salad was fresh and appetizing, a hell lot of olive oil but the vegetables were really very fresh!! Moussaka was heavy on the taste, didn't really like the seasoning on the egg plant but the other part of the moussaka dish was pretty good.Greek coffee - 1 with less sugar (more foam) and 1 with normal sugar (less foam). Difference with the foam, we don't know why. Taste was pretty much the same. Greek hot coffee was served in the tiny cup, similar taste just that hot.Overall nothing to shout about, no impressive dishes nor very 'greekish'. The interior decor was comfy, sleek and warm. A nice restaurant however with food that doesn't compliment it. Service was great, efficient!
5
The food here was amazing! Naturally, seafood dishes and Greek dip/pita bread took center stage and were very well executed. A non-seafood minced beef/roasted eggplants/bechamel was unique and it was superb! Fresh and good imported ingredients were used. Carries a good range of Greece wine. Corkage is S$50 but will allow buy one bring one free. Service was good but can be more polished. Bright cheerful Mediterranean ambient. Fine dinning food quality at bistro price. Highly recommended
3
The good thing is there is a genuine Greek chef at the helm but if he would only keep the food and presentation simple as you would find in a typical Greek taverna it would be so much better. I particularly enjoyed the tarama dip but was not so keen on the small Greek sardines guess I am spoiled by the Portuguese ones!Service was without personality not so unusual for Singapore and prices were far higher than you would even pay in London let alone Athen
5
Maybe I've gotten used to the same drab interior and ambience of Asian restaurants in Singapore but it was a wonderful sensory experience to arrive into the crisp white walls of Alati. The frozen fish in the freezer display and the splash of perfect blue made this place pop!!!Our service experience stood out straight away when the waiter actually introduced himself (an unusual occurrence in Singapore) and it instantly made me feel like this could be a better than expected dining experience. When the waitress offered to let me taste the 2 wines by the glass I was pleasantly surprised - it's not an uncommon thing in nice restaurants but again it pitched Alati to me as somewhere beyond the Sg norm.And as to the food - scrumptious!! When we booked, we reviewed about 30 odd restaurants and decided we were keen on some different flavours so went with Greek. Good choice on our part !! We had the smoked eggplant with toasted pita for shared entree - was surprised the pita had to be bought separately (dip on a fork doesn't quite taste the same as dip on a cracker/bread). The garlic presence was strong but so yum. Serving size was bigger than expected. Shared the filo wrapped feta too - it was sweet but such a good balance of crispy to soft cheese. Mains were just as amazing, huge serving of souvlaki for me and moussaka for the other. We ordered the signature salad to share (got to get the healthy in!) and it was massive and a stand out on its own. So huge we took some home as takeaway. Overall authentic flavours with plenty of herb subtleties, excellent quality to the ingredients and perfectly cooked. We couldn't fit dessert but our dining experience was topped off by a complimentary glass of port which was the perfect sweet ending to our night. I can see us returning for dates, with friends, even work lunches or dinners. Such a delight to find this place - highly recommended!!! And TOP marks to the servers and Chef.

Outstanding in terms of food, service and atmosphere. Authentic flavours, generous portions. Not cheap. Make sure to reserve in advance if planning to have dinner here.
5
Food was delicious and very authentic. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable.
4
Always like the ambiance and white & bright design at Alati. Added to the experience is the professionalism of the waiters and yummy food.
4
Nice lunch setting in Amoy St. Junior/new waitstaff require additional knowledge on the menu. Timing of the food was very good. Set lunch menu was very good value.
5
Love the atmosphere and food.
Would definitely come back for more. Was there for lunch and would love to try out their dinner menu😋😋
4
Food was great, i love the yogurt and chicken kebab. Just the service was a bit slow.
Will come back to try other dishes.
1
Couldn't believe it when I saw the bill and had been charged $5 to swop chips for a green salad (which was tiny). I challenged the waiter on this charge (which was not mentioned at the time) and they refused to take it off.... Needless to say, we won't be coming back here
4
Good service and nice restaurant. I tried the grilled Octopus, but it was a bit over-grilled that night, the octopus turned out to be a bit bitter. I also tried the Salted-baked fish, it is interesting to look at and nice to eat. Overall, good experience
5
Second visit - and the experience was definitely far better than my first time here. Service and food were absolutely top notch, we dined as a group of 6 and tried many different dishes and they were all excellent. I particularly enjoyed the fresh pita bread and dips, grilled octopus, salt-baked seabass and filo-wrapped feta. Divine is definitely an appropriate description for the quality of this restaurant. Will be back
4
In town for a work trip and a few of us wanted to get away from the Marina Bay Sands and overcrowded restaurants so we chose Alati. The staff were great and the food was delicious! We particularly loved the grilled octopus. The restaurant decor is adorable and it really felt like a little escape
5
Colour of most items in this restaurant is white and could feel more clean and neat to me.
Valued great score cause food portion was not small and quality was great as wll.
5
One of the best restaurants in Singapore and specially for greek cusine. The ambience can help you to enjoy the flow and the lightly music fells good to hear. Love this place.
4
Amoy St is flush with offerings with Alati as the only Greek however. We went as a large party of 15 which is typically never easy to manage etc. The food was good as was the service despite the groupâ€™s size. My only complaint would be that the wine list for the most part is of Greek origin with little below $100 a bottle
5
Alati is the perfect place for friends, clients and international visitors who want an authentic taste of Greece in Singapore. Each time I go I bask in the divine interior, paired with the exceptional food. Even the house wine is fabulous (this is rare in Singapore). The lamb chops, dips and saganaki prawns are a must try. Service is excellent, and of course, Spiffy Dapper is just next door for cocktails afterward! Located in Amoy st which is buzzing during both lunch and dinner times
4
The white and blue theme of the restaurant made us wish we were in greece.. lovely decor and music. service was prompt and good. we each had the set lunch. the portions are good for 2 persons to share. the mezza platter was nice. the greek salad was just so so (a bit too much olive oil for our liking). the mains was sea bream with mixed vegetables and grilled chicken with fries. there was only 2 choices of desserts - a yogurt and a walnut cake with spices. Both were very delicious. location is good and easy to find - you certainly can't miss the white exterior
4
Lovely interior decoration that transports you right to a Greek tavern. The portion sizes are huge and the food quality is excellent. Had a real good Mousaka, tasty chicken souvlaki with a zingy lemony sauce and grilled octopus of finest quality. One tiny mark down for not letting us know that the mousaka will need 20 minutes longer to arrive than everything else, meaning one of us was still waiting as the others were finishing up. Friendly and attentive staff. Pricey, but worth it.
4
grilled seabream - fantastic (they even deboned it for you) Mousaka - awesome Greek octopus - freshShrimp saganaki - good for startersPita bread - bite size served warm Ambience - very good , relaxed and brightCleanliness - sofa seatee areas and corners could have been better swept and cleane
4
We went here because of the positive TripAdvisor reviews and we were not disappointed.My Wife is Greek and we have travelled extensively through Greece and the islands so we've tasted the best and the worst.The tzatziki , Greek salad and octopus were perfect. The souvlaki was amazing - large portion and great tasteFeta in filo is a must tryWine list was decent with wines from Greece and surrounds.Some of the staff are new so we needed some help from a more experienced waitress due to a food allergy but that was not an issue. We've all been new in a job!The restaurant fit out is really nice - Santorini style but in an elegant wayThe menu was good but could benefit from some slow cooked meat options like kleftikoWe will be back - efcharisto poli
4
As much as Blu Kouzina is among our favourites for Greek; we were looking for change and decided to try this place!Love the setting of the place. Very pristine and "Greeky"- a lovely white and combination of some blue ..Some of the food was good; some average. The salad was decent; the feta too hard. The pita was warm and lovely; the fava dip was nice. The spanakopita was probably a bit too salt for me; but the texture was perfect. The warm potato salad was nice too.Worth a visit. Make a reservation. Service was neither good Nor average.
5
I'm half Greek hence always on the look for authentic Greek cuisine in Asia. Alati definitely lived up to my high expectations (due to my background). Went there with friends and had a handful of starters (eggplant salad - 'melizanosalata' is one of the best I've ever had), fried Octopus, wine and desert. Food was absolutely authentic and interior makes you feel like on a Greek island. Will definitely come back during my next trip to Singapore
5
First time eating at Alati - and was super impressed.
The food was simply divine - just like the name says. The exec Chef is so talented and the service staff were so attentive.
Highly recommend!!!
5
We have been to Alati more than once and the food is spectacular. The atmosphere is nice and the staff very attentive.
5
Definitely worth it - we were super-satisfied with our dinner. Nice and cozy place and super-friendly staff. Greek food tasted just fine!!
3
Main course of Fish of the day quite disappointing. Overcooked, dry, salty and dripping of oil.
Starter cold mezze platter good and yogurt dessert ok.
Colleagues had chicken skewers in main course which they found ok. Nothing special this round.

We were super excited to check out Alati Divine Greek Cuisine after passing it several times on Amoy Street. From the street, the restaurant was nearly always buzzing in the evening with warm lighting and lots of people happily dining in a blue and white dining room.We scored a table in one of the two front semi-booths with lots of pillows and lean against (super comfortable in the early stages of pregnancy.)Service was initially attentive and friendly and our starters arrived quickly. Each were tasty from the Alati salad topped with warm haloumi cheese to the filo wrapped feta drizzled with honey to the Santorini style fava bean dip (almost exactly like what we had on our trip to Greece).The wine special was out, so the sommelier / manager upgraded my husband's wine to something else for the same price. We were feeling very satisfied.Then we ran into a major snag. With three starters, we decided to order one main to share, the moussaka. Despite our constant following up, we waited 35 minutes. Finally, we asked how much longer the main would take and at that point, it was still another 7 minutes. As we had a sitter watching our son, we ultimately decided to cut our losses and get the bill.As we were leaving the manager did rush out with the moussaka in a takeaway container (gratis), but leaving a restaurant still hungry and late for the sitter is an uncomfortable end to a meal, particularly for a preggy!Alati - we definitely think you have a lot of promise! Please do try to manage the pace better
4
ALATI, the place looks like a restaurant from a Greek islands with its ever popular blue & white combination, what a Lovely ambience .The food was delicious and portion sizes good for sharing, We especially loved the Greek salad, prawns, chicken and cake. Honestly this was possibly the best and most authentic Greek food in Singapore, and the staff are pleasant and obliging. A very enjoyable evening... Will definitely be back for more
5
The warm hospitality, delicious and light food, pleasant service, wonderful ambience and a decent wine corkage. What more could you want?I spent time in a great greek company, enjoying meals, atmosphere, simple and unobtrusive service. Thank you for making this dinner special! Tribute to Chef and the team!I wish you success and a lot of happy guests who, after having dinner with you, will decide to buy a ticket to Greece:
5
This was an unexpectedly pleasant surprise !!! I've missed Greek food. But I didn't realise how much until I went here. This place has it all. Beautifully appointed, amazing service, fantastically delicious food and awesome Greek wines. Nothing else to say but go there now !!
4
Went there for dinner with a larger group of people, we must have been 18 people. We ordered the majority of the menu, and all dishes tasted quite authentic. The salads, dips main courses were all fresh and of excellent quality. Drink selection was good with Greek and International wines, ouzo, tsipouro, beer etc.Highly recommend it especially for couples or smaller groups to enjoy the simplistic but very island resembling ambience...Great choice...will be back

I've been to Alati before at this location with my Wife and thoroughly enjoyed it. This review is actually for anyone thinking of going with kids...couple things worth knowing.Food is great, the style of cooking means you can get some basic dishes that are full of flavour, are interesting combinations and look different ... we thought our kids would be interested enough to try some new dishes and learn a little about Greek culture through food.Our kids are 6 & 4, reasonably adaptable eaters but not world beaters at eating anything put in front of them.Positives;- The ambience and decor of Alati makes you feel like you are in the Mediterranean. Good start! - Ask for a table along the edge so that the kids can have the cushioned seats if they need to sprawl or even put their heads down.- The rosemary seasoned lamb chops and grilled sea bass were great options for kids and both were delicious.- Breads, dips, oils....always fun for kids to try. Greek salad a colourful way to get veggies in....but capers find their way onto everything.- Staff are super friendly; always willing to step in and help. They even offered to take out even small bones from the fish for our kids. Awesome!Things to note:- Restaurant opens at 6pm, for smaller kids I'd suggest getting in earlier as the crowd after 7pm gets a lot more adult and I did not see any other small kids. We went on Saturday night.- It is cold in the restaurant. Take a jumper for kids and wear trousers.- Parking is limited along Amoy street and the coupon parking if you get it is costly at $1.20/30mins after 5pm.I was pleasantly surprised at how much the kids liked the evening; would go again with them....might try the baklava next time too
5
Our local friend brought us to this restaurant on the last night of our stay. It was fantastic! Food, staff and atmosphere were amazing! Pita with tzatziki sauce, octopus and baked feta pastry were absolutely delicious! Highly recommend checking it out!
5
We enjoyed great Greek tastes served by a powered trained team. We liked also the simple shiny decor , the desserts at the end were a very delicious 'surprise , don't miss this 'taste' experience in Singapore
4
This place was fun, delicious food and beautiful decor. I loved the wine pairings and I experienced food I had never tried before. Great experience!
5
Authentic high quality Greek cuisine in an great environment. Flavours, smells, drinks and music that remind home at its best to all of us Greeks ... Congratulations to the chefs Giannis & Fotis for putting heart & soul into cooking!
4
The food is good. My friends who are first time visitors were pleasantly surprised by the taste of the food. Salt baked fish is however over priced in our view
5
Great place. Try the Octopus and the chicken and the salt covered fish. V good Greek red wine. Service fairly attentive
3
Tastefully done up restaurant with a lovely ambiance but very average greek food. The chicken shashlik kebab were bland and chicken was dry. The lamb chops were fatty meat and the stuffed vine leaves rather tasteless. Only thing good was the fish carpaccio. Not returning.
5
We went to Alati for one my friend's farewell dinner and we had an amazing experience! We started with meze platter and some dips, the taramasalata was really fresh and rich in flavor. For the main corses we shared some chicken suvlaki, lamb chops and squid stuffed with feta cheese and spinach. The food tasted perfect, I guess the secret is that they import all the ingredients straight from Greece, so they can keep an authenticity of the flavors, There is a lot of different fish and seafood on the menu, and we wished we could have tried it all. One of their signature dishes is a fish backed in salt... relly tender! Chef Yiannis does a g reat job, we were really impressed. And when we were about to finish and were having our desserts he came to chat with us a bit, that was a really nice touch. We felt kind of special =) The desserts by the way are delicious, rich with greek honey and nuts, and go really well with a cup of greek coffee .  The atmosphere in the restaurant is literally like on Santorini Island. It's all bright and very cozy. We felt like we were seating on a Greek shore. Generally I redcommend this place as well for a romantic dinner, as a friends gathering, or a family dinner. Will surely be back
5
Alati brings many of their ingredients in, fresh, each day from Greece. This gives the authentic cuisine an amazing flavor and taste. The chef is the owner so the full experience revolves around his cuisine. The restaurant is situated in a perfect location with nice shops around for a short walk before or after your meal. The environment inside is comfortable and really brings to life the people and the food. I cannot say enough wonderful things about my experience. It is a must visit
5
Great Greek food made from fresh, quality ingredients. The Greek Chef, has managed to bring to Singapore amazing authentic Greek dishes with a modern vibe. The food was fabulous, however the standout dish was the grilled octopus.The decor is amazing, we felt like we were on the Greek isles.Staff were super attentive.This was our third visit and we will definitely go back to try the many dishes that we saw other tables having
4
Read the reviews in Jan and have to say that I cannot recognise that at all. The service was swift, the food and drinks options were excellent and authentic... and more importantly the quality was really good. I can only recommend this place.
5
Went to Alati to celebrate my wife's birthday on a Tuesday night and was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful food, attentive service staff and excellent meal. Alati is one of the most authentic Greek restaurants in Singapore. Would definitely visit again
5
The food is superb,really i feel that for 2 hours i transferd in greek island.I think the best greek restaurant in town.The service is best also.I read some latest reviews,and really i dont understand some people.I definitely go again more often.Keep the good wor
3
We went during weekday and only few tables were occupied. The ambiance is lovely, service is friendly, the food is so so. We have ordered the Greek salad to start with and the vegetables were not so fresh or tasty. Lamb chops were good but not superb
2
The food at Alati looks great but the pre-theatre menu was incredibly disappointing.For my mothers birthday my husband and I took her and a friend to Alati. The 4 of us decided that we liked the sound of the pre theatre menu so we opted for this.Unfortunately the dishes were disappointing - is it because they are prepared beforehand? What made it all worse is that the people around us had not made the same mistake we had and the food on the a la carte menu looked amazing!Honestly, there's no point in offering a set menu if it's not going to do the restaurant justice. Will try this place again but will not opt for the set menu
2
Decor is nice and looks authentic, location is great but the food..... anchovies in meze starters were rotten and smelled.... the staff was unimpressed and did not even apologize. They offered to replace it with grilled sardines which were tasteless, so were the dolmades. Main course, chicken souvalaki was nothing close to the real thing so was my friend's moussaka. Very disappointing. There might have been a reason why the place was empty
4
The problem with Greek food is that if you want choice, there is a lot of food. All their produce is flown in from Meditarrean and seafood is sustainable farming. All in all, its a great place to go but be prepared to be stuffed or else come with a few more people so easier to eat
5
Beautiful, pure-white interior accented with ocean blue reminded me of trips we used to take to the Greek island of Santorini. Perfect.We took some team members to Alatii for lunch. The options were either a set menu or a la carte. We decided on a combination – all four or us ordered the set menu and also ordered some a la carte starter and dessert dishes. Definitely order the mezze plate (but ask for a replacement for the hummus - it was surprisingly bland). Note: for some reason, this restaurant places raw, diced onions on hummus and taramasalata - we asked them to take it off. One of our colleagues raved about the moussaka. The taramasalata was the very best I've ever had – I’m not kidding. It was fantastic. The tzatziki was excellent too. If we had to do it over again, we would have not ordered the grilled fish as it was extremely salty (I think it was the sauce that was the culprit) but the grilled vegetables that came with it were cooked to perfection. Dessert was a walnut chocolate cinnamon cake – very good but there was no baklava as an option on the set menu, so we ordered it a la carte. It was delicious, too! Note: the baklava pieces are very big – definitely "sharable." Only thing that would have made the baklava even better was a drizzle of warm honey on top. Oh, and the toilets were extremely clean, too. The prices at Alati were extremely reasonable, and you got a lot of great food for the price. I would go back to this restaurant without hesitation
4
Tried the prix fixe lunch menu (3 course). On the first course - Xtapodi (grilled octopus) was quite well liked by my friend and a generous portion. The cold meze platter was good too, nice variety on the platter, quite enjoted the dips and the anchovies.For the mains, we tried the seasonal catch. Flavorful fish and we enjoyed the sautéed vegetables lot as well.Walnut cake dessert was tad too sweet for us. Clean restaurant setting, fairly prompt service. With very few greek food spots in cbd, this worth checking out.
4
Loving greek food has brought me to this restaurant twice in a week! Firstly their lunch set menu is very good! The food is very good too! The bbq squid is amazing. Ambiance is very nice and the decor is simple yet refreshing for a nice business or personal lunch! Would continue to visit this place- its an awesome option
5
The food was delicious and the staff are all very friendly! Must try if you like Greek food. Not many Greek Restaurant in Singapore. 👍🏼😊
4
Had the pre theater set and it was really good! Enjoyed the squid and giouvesti. Lamb chops were awesome too!
3
Loved the Santorini-inspired decor. The food was not the best Greek food in Singapore and quite pricey. Glad we tried it once anyway - if only for the setting!
5
The place is nicely done up in the ever popular blue & white combination. Between 2 of us, we had a set dinner (Greek salad, prawns, grilled fish and walnut cake) with a separate portion of the chicken souvalaki. The food was delicious and portion sizes good for sharing. We especially loved the Greek salad, prawns, chicken and cake. Their Greek olive oil is also the real deal â˜ºInfact this was possibly the best and most authentic Greek walnut cake we have had in Singapore, with just a hint of cinnamon! Will definitely be back for more

I had the pleasure of enjoying a good selection of the entrees on my first visit and the excellent Lunch Tasting Menu on my second visit and whether you go the a la carte route or the set, you just can't lose. Trying to find reasons to return already

This place is super nice, white and blue really like the Greek style but remains classy.The food is very tasty, well thought through.It is obvious that ingredients are fresh and made upon request.I really recommend this place for various occasions: romantic dinner, business diner or friends diner.There is a small terrasse outside for the people who prefer outdoor setting
2
Food looks like greek fine dining but the taste is not authentic.Dolmades are tasteless and uninspiring Can't and didn't go wrong with olives and feta but only a small amount of pita to scoop the humus the souvlaki was tasteless and disappointing Expensive attempt at Greek which hasn't worked
4
This is my second time, and still as good. Ambience is wonderful and relaxed, and the service is excellent. I had the grilled octopus for appetiser, and the mousaka for the main course. We also ordered the stuffed squid as a sharing dish, which was very good and different - stuffed with creamy spinach

We have recently visited Alati with my wife and I must say that the food quality and the price you pay for is really not matching up. First of all, I am from Mediterranean region, therefore I have had those dishes many times and in their home countries. It may seem authentic/different to the people of Singapore, but I can clearly say that the food is mediocre when compared to other Greek restaurants. The restaurant is definitely clean and the interior decor is very nice. The staff was very attentive and kind. We had some warm bread with olive oil, and oil was also tasty. We ordered a horiatiki (salad), keftedes (meetball-meze) and dolmadakia (stuffed grape leaves). As a main course we ordered kotopoulo souvlaki (skewered chicken) and as desert, baklava. First the good ones, souvlaki and greek salad were good, but one of them is skewered chicken with some sauce and the other one is salad that depends on olive oil primarily, therefore nothing special. The real art in a Greek restaurant lies in the mezes, which are by the way 20 SGD each, like a main course in a mid class restaurant.Dolmadakia's filling was dry rice and completely tasteless and leaves had large veins. Normally it should taste a little bitter sweet, that's why they add blackcurrant and a little bit sugar in many Greek restaurants, but this one absolutely had no taste. It was like ordinary rice was wrapped inside the grape leaves. Keftedes was very dry and there was something inside that makes cracking sound as you chew, I though it is a raw spice but my wife thought it is just low quality meet. Baklava was filled with cinnamon, and they sprinkled even more on top, which causes your mouth and throat to burn. It also has a dark brown color because of all the cinnamon. And the funny thing is that, normal baklava do not have any cinnamon at all! All taste should come from butter and the nut (either pistachio or walnut).So we ordered 1 main, 1 salad and 2 mezes, 1 sweet and 2 beers. We paid 160 SGD! For that money you could easily have a high class meal in most of the restaurants in Singapore. I have had bad food before, generally you pay less and you get what you pay for, and do not care much. However I have never paid this much for a mediocre food. This is the first time that I was upset when I left a restaurant and left half of the food on the table. I would rate the place with 3 stars because it was clean, some food was ok, but when I think about the 160 SGD I paid for the food, I believe 2 star is OK. If you want to have nice Greek food, you can still go to Blu Kouzina in Dempsey Hill, you will pay the same money, food is a little bit salty sometimes, but you will at least leave the place much happier

Went for lunch & it was just ok, unfortunately not spectacular for my group. The service & food needs some improvement. Halloumi was just a bit too hard & didnt like the orange dressing served with it plus phyllo pastry was oily & not as flaky as we like it. May try again another day & give them a 2nd chance as maybe because restaurant is 'fairly new' they may be having some issues
5
As per usual, the food was excellent and so was the quality of service received. Everything from the wine to the food hasn't ceased to impress on our 5th visit to the restaurant.
4
The decor makes this place such a pleasant dining experience. Wait staff is attentive. Food is great too. To sum up, we had a pleasant dinner. Great for all occasion.
4
Ordered a grilled fish and it was really fresh. Waiter offer to debone it and that was a very nice touch.
5
I got to know about Alati through Chope website when I was looking for suitable restaurant to celebrate my friend's birthday as she preferred a Mediterranean/Spanish cuisine.
4
Lobster pasta was great however quality of lobster was questionable. Dips are great. Service commendable.
4
Really great restaurant, brilliant selection and genuine, delicious greek food. Lovely setting and perfect for dinner with a small group of friends.
3
Food very good but very expensive!!!
We paid 60dollars for 5 small glasses of prosecco without bubbles
5
The best thing about Alati was the service experience and the ambience. The food was pretty good too, the grilled fish highly recommended. Despite being pretty full, we were well attended to. Water glasses were always filled, dishes were cleared at the right moment. The Greek house wine went well with our dishes. The service was very professional from a team that worked together smoothly. Tiffany was especially wonderful in explaining the different dishes we were looking at with her detailed knowledge, patiently recommending the right choices and quantity to us. Making the dining experience so much more enjoyable, truly setting the standard for service delivery in Singapore!And you know it's authentic Greek when the Restaurant only filled up after 930 when more diners steadily arrived. So go later for the best atmosphere, early if you want a quiet setting

Few dishes to recommend: Fyllo-wrapped feta, (pastry wrapped with feta cheese and fried, served with honey, advise to share with 2-3 person)Gavros (marinated fresh anchovies, nice to eat with the FOC Greek Crusty Country bread given)Dips: They have 4 delicious, appetizing and healthy kind of dips (Fava = bean puree, Taramosalata = cod roe cream, Tzatziki = greek yougurt with cucumber & dill, Melitzanosalata = egg plants with walnuts).... it does not comes with Pita bread, you have do order separately ($4/serving of Pita) I love 4 of them...yummy! Grill sardines (a unique fish/dish whereby not many restaurant serve) taste good, if you are not a seafood eater, please don't order this because sardine has a strong fish tast
5
Love the Santorini themed decor. While everything was white, it was comfortably lit and is very suitable for a date or for entertaining. Tables are kept well apart from the others, allowing a decent level of privacy. Service was polite and friendly. Our glasses were kept filled throughout the night and they didn't mind the questions that we asked. Food tasted good. For $16, the dips were good, but should have come with pita bread. One serving of pita bread is $4. The octopus ($32) was good, and not chewy. The beef patties ($25) were delicious and could have done with some salad greens. The chicken kebabs ($25) were tender and well-roasted. One downer to the evening was the Greek doughnuts, glazed with honey and walnuts. They were probably not very fried well because while it was crispy on the outside, oil had permeated into the dough, leaving an oily aftertaste.Do note that the food took about 30 minutes to arrive - but they provide free bread to stave off the hunger a little.A booking is recommended because the entire place filled up quickly
4
A truly delightful experience. The ambiance was great, felt like I was on a holiday. The best part was the food - delicious! Great place to catch up with friends.
4
I made a booking via Chope. Was send confirmation from Chope as well. But when we went there, the restaurant did not have our reservation recorded at all!!! Luckily the restaurant manager was kind enough to help us arrange a table.
5
The food is great. I'm surprise how tasty Greek cuisine can be. The embience is cosy coupled with warm services from the staff. We love the place and would strongly recommend to all our friends.
1
Terrible service! We waited almost 2 hours for appetizers and overall experience was very bad. The restaurant is also very expensive for the quality of the food!

We are in holiday in Singapore..we was try Greek food.a Long time ago we been in Athens and food is really fantastic.here really unless taste
I can't recommend this place

The design of the restaurant is something different. Does have a slight feeling of being in Santorini.Food wise, it was quite good. Service was also prompt. We were the 1st group in for dinner service and about 20 minutes later, the place started to fill up. Below is the list of food we had:Appetizers:Saganaki : Personally, am not wowed by this dish but could be 'cos I am not much of a cheese lover. But my colleagues said it's good.Gambari: Shrimps were well fried, fresh and tasty. Would recommend this dish!Mains: Garides: Prawns were well grilled, tasty & fresh. But the side salad is quite forgettable.Xtapodi: Octopus was fresh and done well. Not overdone like in most places.Mousaka: First few bites were good. But after a while, the belchamel sauce gets too much and wasn't able to finish the whole dish.Biftekia: Nothing special. Dish was okay but not something we'll order again. Padakia: Meat was grilled well. A maybe dish to re-order next time.Desserts:Loukoumades: The best dessert of the night but the donuts were not golden brown enough. Other than that, the dessert is good.Baklava: Nice traditional dish. But again, not something we're likely to re-order.Ekmek Kataifi: Nothing special. Not likely we'll re-order
2
The dinner started well with feta wrapped in phyllo pastry and haloumi. Salad was not fresh octopus. Octopus was very basic, grilled without any sides on the plate and lack in flavour. Made a mistake of ordering gyros (recommended by our server) which was just overcooked sliced pork belly and industrial frozen fries.The not forgettable part about this place is the decor.
1
I visited the restaurant with my wife on Friday night. I saw good reviews online so I was very surprised of the outcome of the evening. The service was terrible, it took about 10 minutes just to get a glass of water, the food was below average and the meat really hard. The price was ridiculous! For the same amount of money you can get much better food in Singapore. The only good thing is the decor, but unfortunately I didn't feel my belly with that. No way I'm going back
4
Most of the dishes we ordered were very good and those that were not as good were still good. The dishes are mostly true to Greek cooking and the highlight was the salt baked fish which was very fresh, moist and full of flavour. The wine list was very reasonable with some interesting greek wines and the service was a nice balance between attentive, friendly but not overbearing. I recommend Alati as probably the best greek restaurant in Singapor
1
Beautiful interior at this restaurant. Fresh and bright and airy. Great for lunch but not sure about dinner. Unfortunately the quality of the food comes nowhere near the quality of the interior. We had two different mixed platters and all items were average to well below average in both taste and appearance. I would not recommend this place. Lunch for two with no drinks ~$60 net
4
Had a lovely night here. Food was delicious - in particular the seafood was tasty and fresh. Good service, good spacious restaurant with great atmosphere. It was fully booked on the Friday night we were here - so make a booking!
5
Perfect for family/friend gatherings or a romantic dinner for two. The food is as good as it looks.. if not better. Can definitely see myself back here regularly for dinner.
Value+satisfaction guaranteed.
1
In summary- great decor, quiet, average food, expensive and terrible attitude. Wanted the set meal at lunch. Requested that the pork stew be substituted for the veg stew (which was on the vegetarian set lunch menu) as I don't eat red meat. This was refused as the Chef doesn't like to change!! Rarely have I encountered this attitude. I then asked that the pork item is not served to me. However that also didn't seem to suit the Chef and they insisted on serving it on the same plate. When I complained I was shrugged off. The shrimps were good but the chicken souvlaki was dry and overcooked. Will not visit again. Would avoid
4
We had starter the octopus and tzatziki, and as main the lamp-chop and the sea-beam.All dishes have tasted as if you are in Greece - so well prepared.However the service needs to improve. The starter came only after almost 40 minutes wait and the drinks also delayed. We only felt that the great taste of our food made it a good dinner experience at the end

As a European, I am naturally fond of Mediterranean food. When I heard of Alati, a newly opened Greek restaurant in town, I was really excited about eating there. From the moment I entered the place, I felt transported to one of those beautiful all blue and white settings that you find in the Cyclades - and the travel doesnâ€™t stop at the set up. The traditional cuisine is very good, using excellent products from Greece (not cheap, but it really worth it). I highly recommend the Oriatiki (Greek) salad which is simply delicious with real feta cheese!
5
I was visiting Singapore for the first time and my colleagues insisted on taking me out for dinner in this new Greek restaurant. When I saw the entrance, it was like being transferred instantly to a Greek island! The owners have done an amazing job with the decoration of the place and an even better one with the food! We focused on the seafood menu, so we've started with Dakos salad and fava, octopus, kalamari, sardines and crispy fried gambari. Do try also the eggplant dip! Then we had seabass and red porgy- grilled to perfection! It felt like tasting Greek fish, so I asked and they confirmed it: fish come from Greece,as many of their cooking ingredients! The staff is very friendly and happy to answer any questions, at least when I was visiting...I definately recommend it
5
I have tried really good Greek dishes in Europe itself but this is my first in Singapore.Alati presents itself so beautifully in its ambience that It immediately transported me to Greece. The food is awesome goodness and that is some extra brownie points! The grilled octopus is done to perfection and the tomatoes are so interestingly seasoned and I didn't think tomatoes can actually taste so good! We also had the roasted pork shoulder which was a little disappointing as it wasn't as crispy a skin as described in the menu. The tazatziki (made of yoghurt, dill, garlic & cucumber) dip is amazing and you must order the pita bread which is a perfect match with the dip (though the restaurant also provides basket of bread). Crispy fried prawns are good for a starter but I will highly recommend the dip!All in all, it was a beautiful experience and wonderful meal at Alati. :
5
Nice environment and a very friendly welcoming. The service is very good, but the food is even better. It is by far the best Greek restaurant in the region. The menu includes both fish and meat plates. The starters are amazing (separated in Meze and Dips) and the traditional dishes makes you think that you are actually in Greece. Desserts are excellent and highly recommend to try Mastiha, a liqueur that only comes from the small island of Chio
5
Lovely decor in the traditional blue and white with the authentic fare to match. My partner said he'd return for the Moussaka alone, let alone everything else we tried. A light, full flavored Moussaka without the usual oily brinjal but instead brinjal-cinnamon cooked just right and bechamel sauce with more-ish appeal. True Greek salad! Yes! Full Feta cheese slice on top with no lettuce anywhere. Thank you!Kalamaraki starter - battered but al dente - and shrimps saganaki with a delicious tomato sauce to soak (yes I did) my bread in! Shamelessly! I had the chicken skewer because as in the Greek style, it was herby, flavorsome and lean.Fabulous place. Fabulous service. The only tiny downside is .... Try to avoid going when large noisy tables are present in a relatively empty restaurant (earlier evening) as the acoustics is very poor and shouting becomes necessary to be heard. More people cushion the noise as the evening wears on however.
3
I had gone to Alati for a business meeting dinner and had been here three times already. The meze has always been a big winner, and I would rate this the best greek food in Singapore. However when I venture out to dry the meat dishes it was extremely dry. I had tried the Kotopoulo Souvlaki and the chicken came out very dry, albeit the sides were tasty. My business partner Mosxaraki and it came out a bit soggy. I think if I tried the Meze alone as I usually do I would giev this a rating of 5, but the main grilled dish for $24 you would expect the meat to be a lot more tender
5
Celebrated my birthday here 12 Dec 2015. Satisfied customer! Great quality food, great service (by the Greek lady) including filleting our fish in front of us, and nice warm Greek themed interior. Couldn't ask for more!
5
My husband and I just tried this new addition to trendy Amoy Street in Singapore and we thought the food was outstanding. We had the sardines and the octopus -both were presented creatively and tasted very fresh. Our giant beans in tomato sauce starter was delicious and even the bread and olive oil on the table was very good quality. We tried the house white wine - Greek, of course- and enjoyed it. Pala, the restaurant manager, and his staff were warm and friendly. The white and blue Greek themed decor was very charming. Can't wait to go back at night - I am sure it creates a lovely atmosphere. We will be coming back

I visited Alati, for my second time within 2 months, this time with my clients that wanted to taste a bit of Greece. When you walk into the restaurant you completely forget where you are and the internal decoration is such that it makes you feel you are in a Greek Island. Apparently all produce served is imported straight from Greece, hence the very unique taste and texture. Same applies to liquer served which is premium traditional alcohol imported straight from Greece. Taste was very unique and distinctive and between the 4 of us we shared many starters and "meze" plates (meze is to be shared) together with a big fish which was amazing. Trully inspired by his Greek awesomeness, the Chef made our taste buds explode and got my guests really impressed. In fact they confirmed that despite having visited Greece, they hadn't had this experience to date. I strongly recommend and I am not the kind of person reviewing every restaurant I go to.. Just the ones really worth visiting. Hear me out, you will love it 
4
As soon as you walk through the door, the bright white and blue decor is an assault to the senses. For a few hours, you can leave the bustle of Amoy Street behind you and enjoy pretending you're in Greece. Was so looking forward to dining here with my husband as we had not had a special meal out in several weeks. Except, I think we picked the wrong night as there appeared to be a Christmas celebration in progress and a large crowd of people stood in the middle of the restaurant celebrating. Nothing wrong with such a celebration of course, but it would be more appropriate if it was held in private room or a bar, not a restaurant where other people were dining because the din was so loud, we could barely hear each other speak! With so many people standing around us, it became impossible to have a conversation or get wait staff's attention so we requested to be moved, which was promptly obliged. The food was tasty but there are areas where it could be better. Eggplant dip was wonderfully smoky and the saganaki was very nice too. Mains, we chose octopus and moussaka. Would have appreciated if we had been told that the octopus did not come with any accompaniments - it was just a big piece of grilled octopus on the plate. Although nicely done, it would be so much nicer with a lemony sauce or salad. At the last minute, we opted to quickly pick a salad off the menu and the one which was recommended 'Dakos', did not quite suit the octopus dish. The menu could really benefit from the addition of some side dishes that would go nicely with the seafood. Would also suggest that next time a big group chooses to host a celebration here, other guests who are out for a special occasion are also considere

This was a night out with friends and we made a prior reservation as it was a weekend. We were informed the seafood is shipped fresh from Greece 3 times a week. There was an ice bed where you can select the fish you wanted. Once that was done, u can choose the style (we opted for Seasalter crust baked). The fish was amazing! It taste sweeter than local fish catches. We also had the grilled Greek octopus. Yummy!!! It was soft enough and flavourful. Also had the Taramasalata. This is a mouthful to pronounce so I just pointed at the menu. Overall we had a good time. There's a fair wait for the food but that's expected of a full house. Highly recommend making a booking on weekends! I finished off with a special Greek coffee!
5
First what hits you is how cool this place looks, the decor instantly makes you feel like you are in a Greek island restaurant, amazing how an Amoy shophouse can transform like that. Food is exactly how you would expect if you were in Greece, the food is straight to the point, good ingredients, fresh and wholesome. Seafood is a must, with a splendid selection of seafood dishes, a you get to walk up to see the catch of the day. Personal favourite is the octopus, never had octopus this good. Highly recommended
4
In the evening the lights are too bright for a relaxed atmosphere.The charming Singaporean staff are proficient and the food is mostly delicious.Good meze except for dull prawns were followed by superb moussaka.Very fairly pricd good Greek wine was also delightful but so-called Greek doughnuts were actually leaden fritters bearing no resemblance to doughnuts.On our night-a saturday night too- what this place lacked was leadership.The Greek boss was chatting to his chum outside instead of welcoming his guests and creating a jolly ambience.This is so nearly a divine place but the boss needs to be more involved

We visited the Alati on 28 Nov, a Saturday night, with my immediate family of five. We were very excited as we saw positive comments on tripadvisor. We are all foodie and we went there with expectation, we must admit.We started with cod cream, satorini bean paste, egg plant mix and cucumber yogurt garlic paste.,these went extremely well with peeta. We ordered two grilled lobsters, grilled sea bream, pork shoulder and lamb chops. Unfortunately, these dishes are merely moderately done, I am afraid. Firstly, the lobsters. The lobster meat sticked to the shell. Any experienced chef will immediately tell you that it is overcooked. Firstly, it does not look like it was preboiled before grilling, secondly, care was not taken by ensuring the lobster meat does not stick to the shell, oil, lobster juice or whatever-> careless. Secondly , the pork shoulder. Loin meat is best at 55-60 degree Celsius. The pork shoulder was likely fully cooked (instead of half cooked) before we ordered. It was hard and not tender. The lamb and the sea bream tasted ok.Overall, a just okay experience. Not worth for the price overall

This Greek restaurant opened recently at Amoy Street. They are just a stone’s throw away from the Amoy street food centre.The restaurant occupies the ground floor of a preserved shophouse. It has a high ceiling, with white-washed walls, olive trees and smooth stone benches with cushions, which totally ties in with the whole Greek theme. Love the interior.There’s also a ice counter facing the bar, where the seafood are displayed. We started the meal with Greek bread baked in house with special yeast from Greece. The bread is served warm, plus points, is soft and has a yeasty flavor. With 2 types of dip: Olive oil with salt, pepper, balsamic vinegar and olive bits (foreground) and Beetroot dip , greek yoghurt with dill and yoghurt with pesto. The beetroot dip is unique and nice. - Cod roe cream, with a side of pita bread. This is called Taramosalata. Creamy and a hint of fish roe. Reminds me a little of mentaiko, but smoother. Taste-wise, it's nice and you can eat it on its own or as a dip for the pits bread. - Fyllo-wrapped Feta: A rectangular piece of feta cheese wrapped in filo pastry and deep-fried. It's drizzled with honey and a mixture of black and white sesame seeds. If you love cheese, you will like this dish. the honey and sesame gives the dish a unique perspective. - Vine-leaves stuffed with rice and pine nuts: This was cooked in vegetable broth. Vegetarians will also be able to enjoy this. Also called Dolmadakia. This is very good. You can choose to eat the vine leaves with the rice. It taste better than it looks.- Squid: Air-flown from Greece. Simply grilled and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil. The meat is firm yet tender. Yum! - Keftedes - Beef meatballs served with fries and tzatziki (Greek yoghurt, cucumber, dill and garlic). - Am absolutely in love with this! Octopus leg, sous-vide and then grilled. So tender, and love the smoky flavor of the meat. Meat is tender and easy to eat.- Freshly-brewed Greek coffee: Love how they present the coffee to your table. They use a 3 prong tray which has 2 espresso cups and a gold color pot where grounded Greek coffee powder is boiled in water to be brewed. After its served to your table, wait a little for the coffee powder to settle in the pot before pouring into your cup. It's unfiltered, so you do get some coffee residue at the bottom of your cup. The coffee is not thick, but it's bitter.Dessert - Loukoumades - Greek fried donuts with a generous amount of honey on the plate, topped with cinnamon and crushed walnuts. Looks-wise, it looks like local fried friiters. It's crispy on the outside, and inside, it had a slightly dense texture. I could taste the yeasty flavor, similar to the Greek bread I had at the beginning of the meal. A sweet ending to a great lunch! The quality of food here is good and I look forward to coming back again

Most of the seafood served in Singapore comes from warm tropical waters and is absent of the sweetness of cold water seafood. This place ships in fresh seafood from the Mediterranean twice a week and the effort shows in the freshness and quality of the food. I particularly liked the grilled sardines which are the best i've had in Singapore. Their larger fish are also delicious. For starters, there really is a huge selection of delicious options including the only proper authentic greek salad i've ever had in Singapore. As for desserts, i had a different one on each of my three visits and i normally don't eat dessert. There's also an extensive list of vegetarian items so something to please anyone. I look forward to my next visit over the coming week
