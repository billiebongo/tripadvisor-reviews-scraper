Bought a box of pineapple tarts from Bee Cheng Hiang. Received good friendly service and the pineapple tarts were yummy. Would buy again.

So there are a few branches around singapore - all brilliant !
I have been coming to this place since I first went to Singapore in 2007 and I'll be back.
A great snack and always tasty !

The question is: Is the bbq bak kwa gluten free? Any wheat containing ingredients like soy sauce or chinese wine etc?
5
Amazing taste, especially the chili version. Brought a nice amount back to the states on my last trip.
Question I have is that while I understand all natural, is the product Gluten-Free?

What can I say - my first day back in the UK and it is normal to bring back some edible goodies for the office staff after a holiday. This time it was Bee Cheng Hiang Pineapple Tarts (big plastic tun) and EZ Mini selection pack. Within an hour - totally devoured, I couldn't beleive it. I've now got a repeat order to bring back kilograms of the chili pork (my next Singapore holiday at the end of June)

I purchased 600g of chilli bakkwa from Singapore Changi Airport T2 outlet. Firstly, the meat is so stiff/ hard, not even spicy which I paid for. It just feels like the original type. P.S. I tried the same food in Marine Parade outlet and it tastes awesome. So I decided to wrote in via email to raise my question. Upon not receiving any more replies after 2 emails from them which include they offer me for an exchange with their other outlet. I demanded an explanation in my email, however, they just AVOID & IGNORE to my demands. Lossing me as a customer means nothing to them, BUT, the principal over 80 years is totally tarnished

These guys have an outlet at the Airport and also in many areas in Singapore. Their roast pork and beef slices are very famous. It's grilled and sliced to perfection and is absolutely mouth watering. it's a little pricey as i paid around SGD 30.00 for a KG however it's worth taking some home to your loved once.They have an outlet at China Town too. I highly recommend for meat lovers to try their product

I bought half a kilo of Bak Kwa as a gift to be brought overseas. I mentioned this to the staff and asked for it to be sealed properly. I enquired if it will keep well as the package felt warm then and I was assured that it will be fine. Unfortunately it turned mouldy when I presented the gift a few days later. How embarrassing. When I informed the head office, I was informed that it was beyond the 1 month period for free replacement. Very poor service recovery. You've lost a loyal customer.

Best jerky ever. So juicy, tender and perfectly seasoned. A snack to die for. We were not able to stop eating until the whole pack was gone :)You can find their shop in the airport also. There is no better way to spend your remaining coins..

The sliced pork is so moist, you better have a napkin with you. I took some with me on a hike/walk in Singapore...had it for lunch that day and it was fantastic. No preservatives, so apparently it will only last two days in the SE Asia heat...but if it's refrigerated it should last longer...however, it won't last long for me, because I will eat it up

OMG I love Bee Cheng Hiang for the first time I ever tasted the beef jerky and pork jerky in here, so delicious. I would ate it everyday. I hope Bee will come to my city Da Nang, Vietnam oneday, 100% support from me :D

the cured meat here is to die forIif your in Singapore you have to visit here the meat is fantastic.

Excellent, almost superb snack food ... loved the pork skins ... ohhhh!!!
They let me sample all of their main flavor varieties and then I purchased a bit ... absolute must if walking around Chinatown in Singapore.

What I seek is more meat and less fat, carrying full flavour from sufficient time in marinating.Bee Cheng Hiang has done well in marketing and expanding overseas. So it has built a name for itself fairly well and rather easily recognizable from its massive franchising. And with its multiple store locations (rental and costs), the price is shared by the consumer, hence the prices are escalated too. Given that I had tried a few brands of pork jerky, my vote goes to some other brand instead.
5
Buy them as gifts for friends and always receive good comments. Its stores are islandwide from Orchard to Bugis and even Changi airport. The Pork Jerky is very delicious but I prefer Wasabi fish cracker. They are snack food suitable for late night sport lovers sharing food and beer with friends

One of the reasons why we're bound to visit Singapore? It's the spicy pork jerky! Not just any kind though! This must be from Bee Cheng Hiang! They're not only serving pork jerky but they also have beef and other meat delicacies. Established since 1933, the founder of this chain of cured meat delicacies may never have thought that his business would weather all their competitors. It's one of the best, if not the best makers of pork jerky throughout Asia. If you happen to visit Singapore, don't miss out on this one :-)

My friend asked me to go to get her some pork jerky. Saw it and had a taste of it and I was thinking, what is so special about it? I think you need to put more salt so it would taste better. And for 36 SGD for 600 grams it is too expensive. I would not recommend this to people who likes good food and wants to stay on their budget

Stop by this place if you are waiting for a flight. It is well worth it as they offer bakkwa, a kind of smoked meat similar to beef jerky, but tastier and also tender; they specialize in pork, however, not beef. The counter staffers are eager to recite the history of the company which has expanded in many Asian cities/countries like Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, and others. My friend took some on her flight, saying that it's better than the food on the plane

We can't get enough of this Chinese style jerky (but less chewy). We tried various versions but especially enjoyed the spicy beef and spicy pork versions. They come in around 6 inch squares and are barbequed on the premises. You can find Bee Cheng Hiang in several places in Singapore. Its a snack that you have to try and probably enjoy
5
I love the spicy pork from here - I crave it. I bought 5kgs the 1st day in Singapore and we at 1 kg in 2 days. I bought 2kgs more in the Airport on the way home.Try it - you'll love it. Even though I bought so much I didn't have enough after giving some to friends.Oh and yeah - don't buy in Singapore if you want to take it home. Wait to buy it in the Airport cause it's cheaper. Only thing is you should order in advance to pick it up as they may not have enough stock

The pork jerky is too tough. Not as tasty as their competitor. Tasted once and never buy this brand anymore. Their stock turnover is also not as fast and therefore not as fresh as their competitor.
5
Too delicious and couldn't resist it. Couldn't find such good snack in Sydney or even Shanghai. Will try it again this year!
5
I really enjoy this stuff and this store offers a wide variety of packaged choices for purchase. I plan on bringing several home to the USA to share with my family.
5
If you are in transit at Changi airport, head here for a great snack! Ask for a bag of the pork medals (200g for 2 people is plenty). They are gooey, stickey, meaty treats to keep you content!

I can not simply leave Singapore without dropping by this bakkwa (pork jerky) joint and carrying packs and packs home. The bakkwa smell from afar is simply inviting. Very unhealthy food, yet totally irresistible. My all-time favorites include: minced pork bbq (I prefer this over sliced pork as it is more tender), gourmet bakkwa / gourmet fusion (bbq bacon - so sinful but tastes superb! or, bbq bacon fused with bbq pork - perfect combo!). Other items to buy include shrimp rolls (more stuffing compared to the ones sold in souvenir shops), pork floss, crispy pork bbq. Prices are not cheap, but the trip to this joint is a must in my Singapore itinerary. Highly recommended. Would keep going back

I have heard of this place selling pork jerky. we were in Singapore Chinatown and I found them just wandering around the alleys. I bot several types, by far the spicy pork jerky is the best, not just in their store but really, anywhere in the world. I have tried multiple brands in the states and none come even close. I was able to bring some with me to the states on return and still enjoy rationing it slowly. it is so addicting, we would overdose on this if not rationed !!

I am a convert of Bak Kwa now. I first laid eyes on this meat wonderland at Chinatown & just had to have some. I bought the bacon and the chilli pork & couldn't stop eating it as I walked through Chinatown. Imagine my excitement realising it was at Changi Airport as I left....Anyone loving jerky(although softer ) will love this

t is the truth.I am tourist from Hong Kong. I have traveled to Singapore at 20-Oct, i have bought a package of mini EZ cheese.From the big package, the expiry date show 26-11-15. But for the individual package, the expiry date show 26-11-14. Obviously, it is a cheat behaviour. please explain why?If your mini EZ cheese cannot be sold out, please throw it away, don't use this cheat action anymore.

A trip to Sinapore will always end with a 200g pack of Bee Cheng Hiang spicy bacon. They have a big store in Chinatown but they're everywhere including the airport, so there's no reason to miss out. They can be prepackaged in vacuum sealed bags and I imagine those would last longer but I always get the fresh. Put it over steaming hot rice straight from the fridge, or microwave a few seconds

This is the place you go to when you are hungry for a snack on the go. Chilli pork slice all the way for me but the variety is vast and you get some delicious meat marinated beautifully. The taste goes through and through and what you taste is great quality
