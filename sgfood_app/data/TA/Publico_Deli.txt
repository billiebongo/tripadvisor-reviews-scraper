Stopped off for lunch during a walk along the river. The burger I had was wonderful - high quality with a lovely flavour combination. Looking forward to visiting again!

Nice place with good selection of Salad, Brunch dishes and paninis and burgers. Although this is not facing the river, the pace has good breeze and its under the shadow. Good service and not crowded at all. Very good experience overall.

Good breakfast options and nice atmosphere. Good pastries and a phenomenal egg white & chicken toast. Wish they had a bit more flexibility in their egg options (make it you way). Buffet breakfast also looked decent.

Here's a new place for easy lunch with a well thought menu and some interesting items that you just don't find anywhere else.Peanut butter and Nutella milk shake?Bourbon / Tequila milk shake?Count me in. I'll be back to try that and more.Brunch is great for the area. I'm looking forward for breakfast as well

Avocado toast was horrible in taste. There was a dead fly in fruit bowl. Upon complaining waitress took the bowl inside kitchen and surprisingly came back within a minute with same bowl with same half eaten fruits - only difference is fly was removed!!! Waitresses and manager of deli touching bread and other food items without wearing gloves!! Staff need to be trained well according to international standards of hygiene and food serving practices

Love the decor and vibe of this place. However, the service and food quality needs some work. Menu was interesting but a bit bland in taste

Had gone to the restaurant of this place a few weeks ago, but went to the Deli this time. Not as crowded as the restaurant, but still a good vibe and good staff. The highlight, however, was the burger. What a find! Came with crispy fries. The coffee was also very good. You can choose between sitting indoor or outdoor. We sat outside as there were some nice babes there

I had breakfast in Publico Deli while staying in the hotel for a few days.We choose the Mediterranean Scramble and Salmon Benedict. When the food was served, the eggs looked like clouds and the chicken breast looked appetizing. The chicken breast was tender and I liked the taste of yogurt in chicken. My friend choose the Salmon Benedict. It was a different feeling to that of Egg Benedict, but the ingredients worked well together.Especially the sauce of Sriracha Hollandaise added to my appetite. Staffs was very attentive and kindly

When i stayed @ intercontinental BF was served @ this place. Very poor spread (in Intercontinental standard), limited choices for a vegetarian
5
Top notch in all areas, but service staff could be more knowledgeable in their own products but nonetheless I will still comeback for the burgers and this joint should somehow merged together with the Ristorante.

First time visit to Publico Deli and what a lovely setting. We sat outside and enjoyed a nice lunch. Would highly recommend and look forward to another visit soon.

We enjoyed breakfast and a lunch at this restaurant whilst staying at the Intercontinental - loved it - breakfasts were huge - and staff were very friendly. Coffee was great!

My husband and I went to Publico Deli for brunch last Saturday. We were warmly greeted and impressed by excellent service even with busy lunch crowd. Waitress guided us through the menu and recommended the dish exactly what we want. And she offered me hot water and lemon slice when I had a cough. Mediterranean scramble and meatball sandwich are I can highly recommend. We really enjoyed time there with their weekend promotion cocktails Bloody mary and Aperol sprit as well. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The value was excellent. We will most definitely go back

We were at Publico Deli for a group brunch - a new year goal setting event for our gym members. We were delightfully surprised by the thoughtfulness of Jared, for allowing us to order in advance and planned the serving of the food just in time as our guests starting trailing in. We ordered the mediterranean scramble, which offered up a good amount of protein for hungry gym-goers like ourselves. Loved that it was tucked away in a lovely little enclave; we were right at home. Would recommend in a heart beat

Came here for brunch with my wife, and had high hopes - not to be unfortunately. Menu is quite limited, so you would hope that what's on it is done to perfection however, my smoked salmon Benedict was appalling. Salmon was WAY too salty, so much so that I couldn't eat some of it, ciabatta was rock hard and sauce congealed - clearly had been left sitting whilst they finished off my wife's burger (which in fairness she said was pretty good despite a random giant chili / pepper across the top of it. Cappuccino was also very average, not hot enough + when the waiters fingers are all around the top of the cup you feel less inclined to drink it - bit of staff training might help. Hopefully it improves but don't think I will bother to return to see if it has. Don't think any of the other places around here needs to worry about the competition.

The restaurant’s charm lies in the deco & ambience. Food was value for money. Love the Southern Chicken with Waffles
5
Met a few friends for dinner! Love their dishes!! Had their Mediterranean Scramble, Southern Chicken and Waffles, PUBLICO’s “Buon Appetito, Beef Cheek, and Turkey Pot Pie! All were really good!! Their gelato dessert was fantastic! I would recommend this place to people for communal gatherings! The ambience is great!

Service was very good. The wait for the food was a bit long but it was a weekend so kind of expected.The quality of the food, presentation and taste was exceptional

Food is great and not too expensive considering the other restaurants in the area. Try the Publico burger... it's the best
