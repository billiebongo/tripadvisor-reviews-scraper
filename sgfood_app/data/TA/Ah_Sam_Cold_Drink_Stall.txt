A unique no drinks menu place. Let the bartender know what you like and he will concoct a special one for u. Requested for a spicy cocktail and the bartender concocted a laksa cocktail for me. The taste is full of suprises. Awesome!

Great atmosphere and ambience. Good variety of alcoholic drinks available. Ideal place for a weekend hangout with friends

Will definitely comeback to this Singapore style speakeasy bar. Was quite surprise on the selection of liquors they have. Definitely world class.

Well, as I’m writing this review, the bartender is texting away on his phone and now having his dinner just a couple of seats to my right at the bar. Any customer walking in right now would just assume he’s here for drinks and not to make them. Now, as I continue to type, the server is on my left fiddling with her phone. The one drink I ordered is also very dated and unoriginal in taste. Quite certain I’ll not return again.

The name Ah Sam Cold Drink Stall is so misleading. It's actually a quaint bar bang on Boat Quay. A nondescript entrance, a short flight of creaking wooden stairs brings you to the entrance. As you enter is the bar. Well stocked. And a bartender that really knows his alcohol. We had three varieties of his concoctions. Bourbon infused with Cinnamon, with Caramelised Popcorn and Milo! Amazing. And the crowing glory was that they even had the hard to obtain, Green and Yellow Chartreuse! Totally will recommend this to locals and visitors alike. Great view of the business towers. A blend of the old world with the new.

Drinks are overpriced and there is no menu. You just tell them what you like. Get a shock when the bill comes. The pricing is set for similar high end bars with well fitted out bar - this place is literally made to look and is very basic. Not a fan

Came here as a friend recommended it. It is located half way down boat quay above a shop near where BQ is. There is no drink list (the first real issue as you don't know the cost of drinks) you tell the staff what base drink you want and what you like and they make something for you. The drinks here are ok and the decor is really very basic so its not really a nice place inside - very basic. The prices they charge on the high side even for Singapore and you really only find out when you get the bill. Not a place I would be coming back to soon. It's also not really open that late so they are very fast to kick you out (weekday around 11pm

I have always loved the ambience of this lovely little place but on my recent visit, I was just blown away with the service as well. It was evident how passionate the staff is about good cocktails. Our waitress also recommended a brilliant Thai restaurant nearby. While we were having dinner there, a staff from Ah Sam's came by to look for me with my namecard holder! They found it and figured we might be having dinner nearby. Rare to find such great service in Singapore! Thanks for an amazing experience
