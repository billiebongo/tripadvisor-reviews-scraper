Great Indonesia food at Changi V.
Price is very reasonable and the service is good.
The decoration of the restaurant is very Indo.

Delicious authentic Indonesian Food, suitable for large groups. Food is rather spicy so choose fried dishes for those who cant take spicy food. Parking is available.

Service is good. Just need to improve on the quality of the food served. The soup buntut meat was kind of hard.

We were seated near the entrance which had a wonderful view of the sea in Changi.Nice food to complement the view. We ordered the Gurame fish, Renang, Sayur Lodeh and Tahu Kipas for 3 pax. We enjoyed the meal tremendously.

The service staff are very bad & slow at taking orders .Ordered food but not all was served & they wanted to charge .Lucky i checked the bill & saw the error. Wanted to order dessert but no one wanted to take our orders!! We went there with my mum as it was her birthday. They totally spoilt our day .I don't recommend anyone to go there

Set on the quiet Civil Service Club,(membership not required),I finally ended my quest for that delightful and delectable deep fried "dancing" fish. Good enough to eat on its own even though the accompanying dips was good as well. Also the sambal petal is fresh with a nice crunch. Beef rendang wasn't as memorable. This restaurant offers good value set lunch or set meals for 2,4,6,8 pax. Counted only two-way staffs,so I guess if the restaurant is packed,they would be swarmed. Very pleasant surrounding over looking a garden and Changi jetty further away.

I went to enjoy this restaurant to celebrate my wedding anniversary. I choose the set menu of fried fish, grilled chicken, fried squid and lodeh soup. The chilli and crackers are heavenly, and the food are good. They provide unlimited rice and water. It was pretty quiet when we were there, and service was good, atmosphere is also good with indonesian songs at the bac

Really surprised at the quality of the food and service rendered.Food was exceptional. A wonderful place to dine as a family. It is quiet enough for an intimate meal and big enough to accommodate a big gathering. 20% off ala-carte menu promo is great!Really friendly, helpful staff.Would definitely return

Nice ambience and you get a lovely view of the Changi Coast. Food is slightly pricey but for the comfort and ambience, it's worth it.
Will come back for sure.

Love the food and the ambience too! Just wish that there is more parking lots for us to park as we had to wait for quite a while. Luckily we managed to reach the restaurant on time.

The chili dip is originally spicy! Boom! Good Bogor Chicken.... however I can not get what the real Indonesian taste yet with this restaurant...
5
Waiter and waitress was attentive and will move around to ask if guest need to top up plain drinks or rice.Waiter even ask if the food was ok or not.Overall,best dining experience.Recommend to others.

Throw away the impression that indo dining cuisine has to be at a basic road side stall. Pondok offers a good dining experience without breaking your wallet. Thumbs up for setting up at changi civil service club.

Had heard good things about this restaurant. However our experience that day wasn't fantastic. It wasn't bad, everything about the place was just... average. Food was alright, service was inconsistent (you could tell who was experienced and sharp, and who had no idea what they were doing), decor and atmosphere was generic. The prices were alright too, so i have no major complaint

Went Changi City Point there quite early in the evening. Went around the place to look for dinner and decided to try the Indonesia food. The restaurant only have one couple ordering their food and the only guest. Directed to a table and asked whether can sit further in but was told that section was closed.Asked for menu and go through the food to order. Place 2 dishes, 1 rice and 1 dessert.After that observe was quite ran-down as the wall paper already opened out. The food was served quite fast maybe it was already prepared. Overall the food is average

The restaurant is sea facing and east coast park. Gives you a feeling of dining in a beach shack. The staff serve the food with a smile on their faces. Very friendly staff. Beware of the quantity, as their portions are large.
4
The food are nice and tasty. Their specialty fried fish gurame goreng and grilled fish are our favorite dishes. The beef rendang is also awesome. The staff are attentive and quick to respond whenever we need assistance. Will recommend to my friends

Pleasantly surprised by the quality of food! Tried the signature deep fried Gurame fish, sate ayam, deep fried egg plant with chili (Sambal Terong), all were tasty and of good quality! The sambal belachan provided was also spicy and authentic! Tried the dessert El Campur, tasted almost like Chendol, except with more ingredients! The restaurant will be closing soon at East Coast and will reopen at Changi.

Havent had Indonesian foods for a while and so looking forward to this home coming dinner in Singapore. We chose this restaurant which is located in East Coast Park by the beach but it is so warm, we decided to sit inside the restaurant which is huge.With fried prawn crackers and very spicy chilli sauce as starters, pretty addictive but really spicy stuff. I started perspiring........Next came signature dishes, beef rendeng, gurame fish in sambal sauce, deep fried tofu, yellow kuning rice and finish off with ondeh ondeh (dessert). The beef cooked till tender in thick sauce does not have sufficient dried coconut while the gurame fish has too little sauce. Kuning rice was cold after a while and the ondeh ondeh has too little content. Otherwise, a great evening of Indonesian cuisine

Hi Pondok Gurame, I would like to thank you for your great hospitality and it was an honour to meet the lady boss, who constantly check on it. They accomodated well to my reservation with my mother who has difficulty walking. Will come back
