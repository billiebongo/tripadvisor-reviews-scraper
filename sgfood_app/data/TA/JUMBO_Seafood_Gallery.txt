Excellent taste and excellent quantity. Great ambience. Best place for crab lovers. Best place to taste Sri Lankan crabs!
4
Even the chilli crab is a bit pricey but it is acceptable when it comes to the taste and quality we get! Lamb leg is also tasty. We enjoy this meal and time we share together.
5
We had a very good time at Jumbo Seafood!!!
The food were awesome especially the crabs!!!!!!!
We will definitely have a visit again!!!!!
5
I and my family like it very much. Jumbo seafood is very good. I like to eat chili crabs.We'll go again.

No complaints about the freshness, really tops. Even with the delectable chilli sauce and dish preparations that delight the senses of a lot of people, you can help but be accosted by the cookie cutter type atmosphere that this restaurant has. The service is spartanlike and expectant of your quick departure. Sardine box table setting makes you want to get it over with. I would have spent my money in a slightly lower caliber food but better dinning experience place. It just does not compute to be hassled and jostled about while dining with the amount of money it cost to eat there

Three things my Buds from the Red Dot said I must try- Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, Bah Kuh Teh and Singapore Chili Crab. I crossed the first two at various hawker centers around town. For the Chili Crab many recommend me to come here. Arrived here via metro around 1300. Restaurant was at half capacity. The lunch rush crowd gone and no reservation needed. Yes!!!The food: Appetizer- shrimp with pumpkin purée. Really good! Shrimp Fried Rice- Another great dish. Enough for 2 people.Main- Singapore Chili Crab. Excellent!! Very flavorful. Spice level was just right. Enough kick to enjoy. Generous portion and good to the last bite.Environment/Service: Great! The waiter was very attentive. He also let me know I that I ordered enough for 2 people. Glad I stopped because I was about to order two more dishes. Love the bibs and large hand washing stations. You don't have that same luxury The meal was worth the price. Glad I listened to my buds that pointed me this way

I usually frequent their East Coast branch but decided to try their central location since I was bringing a bigger group. Staff at the entrance were poor, no eye contact and I got told off rather rudely that they would only hold my table for 15 mins (I was 30 mins late but friends were already seated, and I just needed to know where the table was located). The waiter that attended to us, however, was pleasant and took his time to explain to us what was worth the money and the types of crabs they had available. Food-wise, the standards vary with outlet locations. I would still prefer the East Coast outlet's Chilli Crab
5
The purpose of dine was to let my friends from Japan try Chili Crab and it went super well. They were so happy to try Chili Crab (actually sauce), and kept ordering deep-fried buns to fully enjoy the sauce.Cereal prawns (recommended by JUMBO staff), Deep-fried fish with other type of chili sauce and spinach with eggs were also great!Wished to have steamed bamboo clams but they were sold out!Should have pre-ordered upon reservation.Oh! The reservation is a must, otherwise you need to wait for 45 - 60 min during the peak hours.

At Jumbo Riverwalks, our waitress, Natalie Young, served us at superb level. She voluntarily kept our fried rice warm with portable burner. She constantly checked our table to insure all was well. That is a very tough job at the very crowdy, busy restaurant like Jumbo. We much appreciated her service and will come back for sure.
5
We had a wonderful experience at jumbo seafood. We were served by the attentive supervisor Tina. For first timers like me. Do take note on the menu that the golden phoenix isn’t chicken at all. Just chicken skin with some fish meat. Overall the seafood experience was worth it.
4
Quality of food is good! Love their rendition of chili crabs. Serving of food was a little too rush as the restaurant tries to fit into a fixed dining slot per table.
4
Nice environment and good service staff. Food wise, the fish that we ordered might have over steamed, the fish tasted hard to chew. Overall Jumbo Seafood Gallery still a preferred place to go for.
5
Jumbo Seafood knows how to make chili crab. Great selection of other foods and beverages as well. Fine job as always. I will be back.
3
Went there for a birthday celeb. Was very surprised at the hefty cost of each dish, and peanuts are not free.
4
This is a busy restaurant due to the location and its name. We are a group of 7 including 3 kids. We ordered Alaska crab which is special on the day. $520 just for the crab. We liked the pepper crab. Chilli crab is a bit too sweet for us. Other dishes are really tasty.
4
The only negative thing about the place is that experience is somewhat hurried - one needs to vacate table within 90 minutes, as such I always feel being pressed to eat fast.Having said that, the crab is delicious. Price was SGD 80 per kilo, so quite pricey but still so good. One portion of ~1kg is enough to feed 2 (with some obligatory rice).It is our 2nd time visiting the chain and I am looking forward to my next visit
3
My family came from Netherlands to visit Singapore just want to taste the best chilli crab in Singapore. But too bad it was not what they expect. The taste of all foods that we ordered is just an average and not as delicious as people thought. We ordered 1 portion of chilli crab (1kg) with 12pcs small fried bun, 1 portion prawn cereal, 1 portion of seafood fried rice, 1 portion of baby kailan vegetable, 2 bowls of steam rice, 2 thai coconuts, and chinese tea. Total bill was S$220,- and over priced.
5
We went to Jumbos at Clarke Quay late Tuesday night. We didn’t book but we were very lucky to get a table for 4 inside. We were served tea, and peanuts to enjoy while we waited for our meal. We ordered chilli crab, hot buns, vegetables as well as rice. The chilli crab was delicious. We have been to Jumbos at Clarke Quay three times now and the food is always brilliant and consistent in both quality and quantity. One member of our group also had a traditional dessert and thoroughly enjoyed it. The service was excellent, attentive but not intrusive. We had a great time 
3
We'd made a reservation for a specific time but were were told to wait on arrival at exactly the right time and told we should vacate the table after 1 hour, although we'd agreed 1.5 hours at reservation - they were very busy. We'd booked an outside table but were offered an inside table. 2 crab dishes and rice ordered and all were brought along at different times within a half hour time frame. No large crabs were available and we were told that only small crabs were available and that we would have to have 2 of these. When the bill came the price for 2 small crabs was way in excess of 1 large crab. very pricey indeed with poor service with reminders going unheeded. Too busy and expensive for what it is with lots of other similar restaurants that can do the same thing for nearby, maybe for much less. Finally, the middle (brown meat) of our crab dishes was missing
5
We had booked ahead for our first night and asked for a table on the front. When we arrived we were very well looked after, mainly by Gerard who was very good throughout and even stopped us over ordering!! I notice other people saying the staff were disinterested, but didn’t find this at all.The food was great, really enjoyed the chilli crab, and yes it is messy! All our food arrived at the same time and didn’t take that long considering how busy they were!Will definitely return on our next visit to Singapore
4
Pepper and Chilly crabs are must haves, at Jumbo Seafood. That it is by the riverside is a big plus. Can be a bit crowded during Fri evenings. Could do with have ‘mobile charging’ help. :)
5
Recommended Delicious Chille Crab, cereal prawn, seafood fried rice.
Jumbo seafood at The river walk branch is a place to visit
5
so surprised that a VIP has been assigned for us. Nice food with good service. Family enjoy the wonderful dinner
5
Food is good however crab at riverside is still better for some reason. Service is also good. Polite and helpful however maybe 1 or waiters arent as good
2
OK, I know Singapore is noted for Chile Crab, but at Jumbo, this was an overrated, expensive, and messy dish. The wait staff was disinterested and not willing to explain menu items. The rap music in the adjoining restaurant was distracting. They seemingly complementary tea and peanuts (which is offered without asking) will appear on your check in the end
3
Went mainly to have a fix of chilli crab during our 3 day stopover. However, was disappointed that a small crab approx. 900g cost SGD 80. Also, the black pepper venison was not available On the plus side, the service was fast and we were out in a little over an hour
4
Located in the middle of the city, Jumbo is crowded, surprisingly even on a weekday. Do make your reservation. I must say that's absolutely necesary. The person handling the guests aren't exactly that friendly. My friend and I were seated at a small table outside, beside another table. That's the worst arrangement. I could hear the conversation at the next table. My friend and I kept quiet throughout the whole dinner because it was almost impossible to hear and be heard. We decided to concentrate on our food. Fortunately, the many dishes we ordered were delicious. I like the mango and duck salad. It's really appetizing. Chili crab did not fail at all. People might not like it because it does not suit that palate, just like how I don't even want to try cAviar. However, the chili crab tasted exactly how I would like it to be. It reminds me of the chili crab I had when I was a child. It's indeed iconic. I'm I wish we had a bigger table to accommodate what we have ordered. Unless you are extremely a big fan of crabs, one crab is really sufficient. A few years ago, we ordered two. We could not finish and had to bring homes one of the crabs. We had the famous chili crab. It got pretty spicy towards the end but you can ask for a milder version. Visit the restaurant at around 6 pm to enjoy the sunset. It will be a nice setting. Ask not to be seated close to another table, otherwise your dinner can be ruined.
3
This restaurant was recommended to me by an acquaintance as well as local taxi drivers. We had the set menu B. The chili crab was good, not amazing. The shrimp dish was good too but nothing special. Everything else was just OK. I was really expecting the meal to be great based on reviews and the cost. Also they don't offer cocktails, only beer and wine. This was my first time in Singapore and have always heard how amazing the food is there so I was disappointed since this dinner was my last night in town.
1
To be totally honest with you I wasn’t impressed! Famous chilli crab took more than an hour to cook while other dishes that we ordered was not being served at the same time. We end up leaving the restaurant. They charge us $2 for peanuts that we didn’t even order and $1.50 each wipes. Scams! We felt let down and very disappointed. Guys walk down the side river where lots of office are... there are plenty of restaurants down there, foods was great, fresh seafood for cheaper price. Friendly staffs, good atmosphere, we end up going there all the time now.
5
We really enjoyed our meal here. The service was quick and servers were friendly and helpful. We sat at a table outside but it wasn’t too hot once we had a cool drink to sip on. They were VERY CLEAR in both the email confirmation of the booking and when coming in that we would have to vacate the table within 1hr 15mins. I personally have no issue with this as it means prompt service! If we want to sit and chat, we can go to a bar afterwards. My parter highly rated the chilli crab and I had salted fish and chicken fried rice which was delicious - I have a shellfish allergy which makes eating at a place like this hard, the waitress was really helpful working out what I could have. The surrounding area of Clarke quay is also lovely to walk through after and very pretty with all the changing light colours

Jumbo is soso

This restaurant is always very busy with long queues waiting. Best to book in advanced. Popular dishes are chilli and pepper crab, bacon roll and lamb rack!

The services provided by the staff were poor. The time for dining is rush. It urges guests to finish their dining in short time so as to serve second rounds. Do not go to this restaurant.
3
We bought 2 x $100 voucher but only able to use one.
Staff were unsure about the promotion and said they actually does not allow usage on weekends. But it is not stated on voucher. Took more than 15mins to check for payment settlement.
5
We ordered both types of crabs - chilli and black pepper - which were finger-licking good as always, along with local faves like sambal kang kong and baby squid. Impossible to get a table without a reservation so book early!
5
Excellent food and excellent services as usual. Tried different dishes this time and Jumbo never lets me down. Will definitely come again in the future.
3
Outdoor was hot and squeezy, given only 1hr 15mins to eat the meal when the food only arrived 20mins later.
3
The experience was tainted by a rude overweight man in a suit (not sure if he’s a supervisor at the restaurant). We were celebrating a family member’s birthday that day and were disapponted by the treatment we received from the personnel who attend us. My mother asked some valid questions about some of the dishes on the menu and he repeatedly look confused about it. He then laughed as if we were asking stupid questions. He also asked what exactly we didn’t understand about the menu (even though the dishes we asked about clearly did not describe what dish it was and what main ingredients were in them). That is not how someone wants to be treated at a restaurant when you are paying those sort of prices. The only saving grace was that we enjoyed the chilli crab dish and the other staff who attended to us were courteous
5
As always, chili crab was awesome.. too bad it wasn’t crab was smaller than usual.. something about the crab not being in season, so the seafood was not as big as expected. However, staff has recommended a different crab that was meatier and comparable I. Price
4
Brought my friends from Australia here for their signature chilli crabs and it certainly did not disappoint. Sauce was robust, flavourful and went very well with the fried mantous. Even though it is on the pricey side, still quite worth the experience and indulgence once in a while
5
We like it very much and the location is good. Price is acceptable, We can take a river cruse afterward.
5
Service was excellent despite the restaurant being full and I can see that they are also short handed.
2
They made me wait over 20 minutes after finishing meal. Whenever I requested to do it requickly, they responsed "just wait" . I would not recommend this restaurant because of poor service.
3
Service was within expectation. Staff make mistake on my order for dine in and take away. Waited a while before they attend to us for the ordering of the food.
5
friends were visiting from overseas. we always bring tourist to Jumbo. People love chili crab and cearial prawn plus Kangkong. it was really good.
3
I brought a visiting family to the restaurant. It was very crowded and I guess the servicing manager was under stress and hence appeared a little uptight when we were ordering the food. After we paid the bill, we were still chatting away. The manager suddenly came over and abruptly intervened by saying “Thank you”. I thought he could have put it in a better way if he really wanted us to move on. I was a little embarrassed as my Taiwanese guests were quite shocked at his sudden intervention
4
Took my wife and two kids (6 & 7 year olds) to eat here. Chili crab was delicious! Getting the bread to dip in the sauce was worth it. Be ready to empty the wallet though as it costs $100. They also give you an hour and a half to eat you dinner, but it was plenty of time
4
Finally I got a chance to visit the most famous seafood in Singapore. The crab test sooo nice, juicey and tender.... especially with the special source. But the price is not cheap at all if you are budget visitor.Overall it is good, after meal you can also visit the Clark Quay for a drink..
3
Price is too high . Food was average. Disappointing. This is the 3rd time in 4 years I have visited Jumbo seafood for Singapore Chilie Crab. The standards and quality has comedown, tIt is too highly priced and you come out feeling it was not worth for what you paid. Its now just a Hype and nam
4
This was a small family dinner for four, 2 kids, 2 adults. We had chili crab, fried rice, small squid, and some noodles. The crab was amazing, so fresh! The small squid were delightful as well. The noodles and rice were average. The crab was expensive but when you taste it you'll understand why. I would go back again for sure
5
We had birthday celebration meal here. The service is excellent. The waitress was very patient in taking our order, while maintaining a present smile. The food was great and fresh! The prawn and fish were wonderful!
5
The senior Supervisor Mr. Simon Hoe is very friendly who attend to us promptly. We really enjoy our stay their. As per his recommendation, we ordered the food. Eventually it turn out to be very much satisfactory. Everything is good.
5
Honestly not a fan of chili crabs but jumbo's ones are outstanding and the only time I truly enjoy the dish. It's not the cheapest but good for an occasional indulgence
4
Awesome seafood. Since the crabs are from Sri Lanka we decided to stick to other seafood items which were nevertheless good. The staff are friendly and helpful but extremely busy as the pace is almost always crowded.
4
Brought some visitors from Europe to try out one of Singapore’s signature cuisine. Surprisingly the home made Tofu was the crowd favourite. Got a VIP2 room, too.
4
I love their Chilli crab!! Also the egg yolk shrimp is very tasty. Can ve very crowded so do make reservations if possible
4
Business dinner to invite overseas guests to try and taste Singaporean delicacies pepper and chilli crabs and local specialties. As usual very satisfying. Thank you
4
The seafood tastes good. The scenery by the river is also beautiful. But the service attitude is general.
4
The chili crab is the signature of the restaurant. The taste is good but the price is quite high. The waiting time is relatively long as well.
4
This is probably a must-go in Singapore, and the food and service never lets you down. Just amazing. But be aware of the prices. They are obviously taking full advantage of their polularity and reputation, and we’re always (negatively) surprised when we get the bill... Red House at Robertson is indeed a good option, and although We haven’t compared prices in detail, that place seems a bit more affordable. And the food and service is equally good
5
This restaurant has great outdoor sitting space. Main reason to visit the restaurant was to have awesome food mainly Chill Crab.. which was accompanied by excellent service by staff.
Thank you.. 😊😊
5
Food was good, service fast. A*! The only downside is that you must make reservations weeks in advance.
5
best chili crab in singapore
best location
nice service
good for couples family and friends
jumbo seafood gallery
5
The service staffs are excellent and the food was great too. We ate until we are so full. Really recommend this outlet.
3
Best chilli crabs in Singapore imho. Used to be my favourite Jumbo branch. However, maybe due to it's popularity, service seems to be not as good as before. Recommended dishes: chilli crabs with fried buns. Mee goreng.
3
A popular place for dinner, the restaurant was packed!Main dining room as well as private rooms were full and the staff quite active running between tables. We had a large selection of fish, seafood, meats, noodles, rice etc and the quality was inconsistent.For instance the pepper crab was great, the chilli crab average.The grilled beef was very good, tasty and tender, the chicken was basic.Great fried rice by the way.A very negative note though: the bathroom area. Filthy and unacceptable for a restaurant.The floor was dirty and swept, but the walls and the ceiling too. Disgusting really
2
Great location, famous for its crabs but the place is really negatively impacted by its success, As it was not possible to make a reservation online, I decided to go directly to the restaurant and they have an electronic waiting list with code. It is not managed like a restaurant but more like an administration. I felt like going to the post office! When I have received my table, I was told that I had to be out by a certain time! How can you predict how long it is going to take to order, to be serve and...to enjoy! It seems like this is a concept this place has forgotten. Too bad..
2
Good chili crab (very tasty) but no good ambience and too busy feeling for enjoyment. No effort from the staff, which makes the experience dissapointing. As said, the food is good, but for the money you could ask for more than average McDonalds kind of service level (no affence Mc's!
4
We were given a big table for a group of 8 persons inside the restaurant and the service was great! Glad that they were able to fulfill my request of indoor seating although it was fully packed due to Public Holiday. The staffs were generally attentive and responsive, although the white rice took awhile to be served. One of the staffs took the initiative to ask if we want to change our plates full of shells even when we did not request for it. Love their signature Chili crab with fried buns (man tou). The "Soon Hock" fish was very fresh as well. However, the taste of the seafood fried rice can be improved further. Recommend to make a reservation as it may be full house, especially during Public Holidays or weekends. Overall it was a good experience.
3
Love the black pepper crab here. Crab was fresh and succulent and coated with just the right amount of sauce.Would have been better if they can come up with a system to ensure that once customer declines the apron to a service staff, all service staff are aware so that we donâ€™t need to be asked several times by different service staff if we needed one
5
The service here is very perfect, have affinity.
The room is very big, give a person feel very comfortable, great vast pools, is a perfect experience.
Endless pool great, worth a visit.
3
Normally they recommend guests to order too much. one small chili crab and medium sized fried rice might be good enough for couples. If you order buns, please order small sized fried rice.
5
JUMBO gallery has. . good food, sufficient amount, convenient reservation system, good location and fast service.
5
chill sous is very diffrent with be normal chill
my parent eat a diffrent kind of variety chill
it was very delieous
4
Nice and fresh food as always. I brought my friends who visited Singapore for the first time. We did enjoy the time and the food in JUMBO.
5
Have dinner with my parents during our trip
Very satisfied with the Alaska crabs and the service as well as the atmosphere
Strongly recommend
5
Went there with a group of 6. We had the chili crab, chicken satays, cod fish in chili sauce, fried buns, fried noodle n fried seafood rice. The crab sauce was delicious and the cod fish was out of this world. I just found the fried rice dry and the crab difficult to eat with the sauce and trying to take of the shells. But I guess it's the part of the experience. Booking is a must otherwise u have to queue up. The service was also very good and we have good tips from the waiter on the size and different types of sauce
4
We ordered the famous Singapore Chilli crab, herbal live prawns, scallop fried with yam, shark fin and crab meat soup and it was surely fantastic. Reasonable price and left very full. Food order came out very quickly which was great.Only down side was, we had to rush our meal. We booked for 6pm but had to be out by 7:15pm. Maybe Jumbo should change the policy and have it for at least 1hr and 45mins
2
we had lunch at the Jumbo Seafood Riverwalk this weekend. We were seated outside without asking for our preference. it was very hot and we would have waited to sit inside. the servers were doing their job, efficiently but without a smile.we ordered their signature dish, chili crab, among others. it was a little strange that they couldn't tell us the price for it. they quoted per kg and couldn't tell how heavy one crab actually is. when we asked how many many crabs we should order for 2 people, they recommended 3. luckily we only ordered one... this one we already couldn't finish. they are huge. the food tasted ok. crab was great, the sides not so much. at the end we wanted to use a voucher advertised by the restaurant on an app. we followed the instructions and paid. then there was a problem with the communication between the app company and the restaurant, taking 45min in total. during the entire time we weren't allowed to leave even though the service people and even the manager on duty clearly saw that the payment had been processed on our end. when I more directly told them that we would leave now, they first hesitated and then allowed us to leave after taking pictures of our email address. we're customers, not criminals. won't go there again. and if you want to go there : don't use vouchers!
4
We were recommended to dine here by our local associates. And it didn't fail. The food is real good and tasty. It was crowded during lunchtime. Fortunately we had made reservations in advance. Service was quite slow, probably due to the big lunchtime crowd. However, the price is high, expensive. Just a little caution...if they recommend certain dish, just ask them the price first... could end up a lot even though it taste good.
5
Good food and good service! The staff were quite responsive in general and always happy to help. I would also recommend the mocha pork ribs. We will certainly be back.
3
The dish is not so nice. The place is very very hot. Cant enjoy the food. Just for the name, the services is ok.
5
Simply fabulous chillie crab and succulent prawns! Try the crab with the fried bread. Make a reservation several days in advance as they are always full! They have 2 set menus which are somewhat expensive but fully worth it.
5
My Philippines friends enjoyed the good so much that they were licking their fingers. They gave a big thumbs up for this restaurant and will definitely recommend to all their Philippines friends back home.
5
It was very tasty, proper frying of chili crab and especially crunchy shrimp was fantastic. However, it would be a more comfortable meal if you were to provide vinyl gloves when eating chili crab.
5
As usual, food is good and seafood is fresh. However, food is usually served one shot so if you are a slow eater, don't take the seats in the aircon dining area.
4
Enjoy the food ... but the service of the staff is abit slow and in attentive.. didn't even change our plates till we tell her and also our tea run out also didn't refill immediately
5
Thank you for your restaurant's delicious food and kind of your staffSingapore is my first trip with my friends, and we worried about food because almost food we have eatend last few days are make our try hard to eatHowever, your restaurant's foods are really really perfect.So me and my friends are spend very happy times, and we now love singapore!!Thank you very much, you give happy experience to ours.I'm sure If i go to singapore again, i visit you restaurant surely

When visiting Singapore, Chilli Crab at Jumbo's is a must do. The restaurant is constantly busy so make sure you book otherwise you may have a bit of waiting time or be disappointed in not getting a table. There is a set menu depending on how many people at your table which makes it a little easier to choose. The chilli crab comes out in a big sizzling pan which is full of flavour swimming in a sauce. Although it can get a little messy cracking the crab shell, a large bib is provided to protect your clothing. Our meal came out quite fast considering the restaurant was full. The staff are very efficient and friendly
1
Given a chance, I will not bring my guests to Jumbo Seafood Gallery anymore. The staffs served as though we were there to beg for food. Majority pulled a long face and when requested to change plates that were full of shells, the reaction was like asking us to do it ourselves. No more next time
5
The crab was amazing! The sauce was delicious and the crab meat was so soft and yummy! The fried buns went perfectly with the meal and the fried rice and beancurd was also great!
4
We've ordered the chili crab and cereal shrimp and some veggie and the friend bum. All of the dishes are great
5
Fresh seafood. Excellent taste. I always like Jumbo Seafood Gallery. The authentic chilli crab is one of my favourite.
3
THE TASTE ESPECIALLY CHILII CRAB IS SPECIAL AND GOOD! AND THE DISH IS BIG ! PRICE IS a little high , and space is a little crowded .Last but not the least ,the toilet should be cleaned up often！
5
Cereal prawns and chilli crab are the best dishes. Fried rice is a little bland. Black pepper crab is average.
4
The famous chili crab is the best thing to try at this place.Make sure you have advance reservation at the peak time of the day or you can miss the chance to try them.
5
The dishes there, not only the crab but also other dishes are really nice, the price is very reasonable. All the staff there are so helpful and cheerful. I surely will come back again!
3
The waiting time can get up to 2 hours for tables larger than 2 - seriously pre-book OR turn up with the thought you can wait for 45min+ for a table
4
This time we booked a late slot as we had overseas guests in Singapore for the first time. Not wanting to be rushed, we booked a late dinner and it was worth it. Fortunately, we were still on time to enjoy a Chili and black Pepper Crab. The table next to us arriving later was not as lucky and did not get a Black Pepper Crab anymore.The food as usual was very good. Everything was served together at once, which was good based on the choice of our dishes.Initially, the service was a little slow as the restaurant was packed to the last seat. Once people had started to leave, the service was back to its proactive and attentive level that we were used to. Additional orders for drinks and the must-have deep fried buns with the Chili Crab were served promptly. It was another very good experience at this Jumbo outlet and we will return soon with other guests visiting Singapore
3
It was my good friend's birthday and i requested for the restaurant to give her some surprise when i made the booking through Chope, the restaurant did not aware of that (strange). So i have to inform the floor manager/ captain. Initially he said will try to give us some discount on the clams we ordered; then ended he gave us dessert instead :( What a disappointment from clam to dessert...So my friend wasn't quite happy w this arrangement. Other than this, food is alright. Not fantastic but alright.
4
Food is good as usual. Chilli crab is a must and cereal prawn too. Atmosphere is rowdy with full house as usual.
2
I have visited here 3 times and this time was the worst food ever. The favor of this food is little bit changed
1
Service is bad
eating my lunch .. but server request bill..
And tea refill is too late.
Crab's taste is MSG
5
The seafood set lunch for two persons is great. The portions are almost same as a la carte. The giant crab is a must and the twin deserts are the surprise.
1
I ordered too much food by force of staff.
After all, I came out without eating all the food.
I will never find this store again.
4
Price is on high side. Nonetheless, good foods, great experience. Will be back again during special occasion.
5
The environment besides qualark quay is good. And service is ok. The only drawback is a bit expensive on weekends.
4
Their signature chilli crab is the best in town! Seafood fried rice was a bit disappointing though.. Too mushy and not much taste. Service was first rate.. Plates changed regularly and plenty of wet towels and serviettes!
1
The service at this restaurant is absolutely terrible! They are shady, and I would suggest that Americans take their money elsewhere to eat.We ordered two jugs of beer. Then they offered us Chinese tea, which is typically complimentary in Asia, and especially when we are already drinking paid for beer. Only one of us accepted, and they just poured it for two of us. Then they threw down some peanuts on the table. When we got the bill, they had charged us for the tea and peanuts, neither of which we asked for.They delivered dirty bowls to our table, clearly dirty from a glance observation. These dirty bowls should have been recognized by the server.At no time did we even have an assigned server. We just got help from anyone that passed by our table.We ordered from the set menu to get a variety. Don't do it because most of what came with that set menu was terrible. We can only recommend the chili crab and shrimp/prawns in a mayo sauce. The set menu was for 4 people, however, it was just barely enough for 3 people. The fried rice was BASIC and tasteless. Fried rice should include more than rice, eggs, onions, and few shrimp, especially, when it is called "seafood fried rice" and the joint is run by Chinese.Then, at the end of the night, when it came time to settle the bill, the shadiness got worse. First of all, they give you a coupon for $50 off for a completely different location. Secondly, they want you to pay in cash or via American Express. So, they professed that the VISA cards were not going through. They ran my credit card 3 times, without my permission, and professed that none of the charges went through. I've since found out that all three went through, and they've only refunded me twice, so there is a refund that they still owe me. Then, I relunctantly gave them my debit card, another VISA, and they ran it twice to no avail. Because we don't have enough cash, I said well follow me to the ATM machine. Welp, since my card had been run multiple times, the ATM would not give me any money. A restaurant employee walked with us to the machine...During the walk, he told us that they had been having problems with VISA all night. I asked why their servers did not say this to each table that sat down, and he had no explanation. Needless to say, had we known about the VISA issue, we would not have eaten there or would have gotten cash. Hard to know how much cash to get when the menus don't reveal prices for most items.The service sucked, the food was mediocre, and it was not worth half the money we spent there. Again, the only thing good there are the chili crab, braised duck and mango salad, and the shrimp/prawns.This place requires a reservation, so definitely do that if you decide to go. The only reason this place gets good reviews is because folks have not had better. And to top it off, I'm not even sure why the joint is called Jumbo. There was NOTHING jumbo except the crab claws.Extremely disappointing, and now I gotta spend some time on my last day in Singapore getting them to fix the charges on my credit card. Because at this point, they were paid in cash and credit

My family and I have been to three seafood restaurants in this visit in Singapore August 2017. Jumbo is just the best after ordering the same dish in all of them. If you have limited time, please just go to Jumbo n no other, you will enjoy the black pepper crab and lick your fingers with wasting a penny n one minute. Cheers

Was there for my Husband birthday celebration. He enjoyed the Chili crab. Restaurant is a bit crowded with too many tables. food is good and server is nice.
5
Jumboo seafood is very good ，very delicious,We'll come again.It would be better if I could give a discount!
5
Visit to this place is an adventure on its own! Make sure you book your table (online booking available) in advance because this is one of the most popular seafood restaurants in Singapore. They are known for their delicious spicy crabs!
5
Fast and efficient. Food was good as well,though price is quite expensive. Still... highly recommended.
4
We ordered a big Alaska crab as the stuff recommended to us. Half made Chili crab taste and half salted egg. It tastes very good and very worth the money. Stuff are kindly and the service is also good. Will come back again!
1
Restaurant atmosphere was nice and food was good but server was awful. My wife asked new plate and silverware and our server rudely threw them on our table and just went away. What a dirty attitude
4
As usual, I really love the chilli crab. However, I think the noodle and vege is a little too expensive. Taste a little bland. My advice is, just order crab. The rest isn't really worth the bucks.
5
This is so far the best chilli crab I have ever had in Singapore. The sauce is so good that we finished all. The place is not as crowd as the other outlet near the river. Reservation is still required to avoid any disappointment. Service is very Good

My partner and I were advised to eat at Jumbo by the cab driver, we wanted seafood. First we booked but still had to wait 45 minutes. We were escorted to a table but a waitress that did not seem pleased we were there at all. We then attempted to order only for her to tell us "no English". We sat there with her staring at us and us unsure what to do, luckily another male waiter saw this and stepped in and took our order. We ordered our entrees and mains in one order. My partner received both at the same time while I received my entree but mains never came out. We motioned over and over for a waiter but no one came. My partner finishes his meal and mine still had not arrived. We finally got a waiter who then told me they had forgotten my mains and it would take at least 15-20 minutes to prepare. By this stage we had enough and asked for our bill. Our bill came to $300 which we were somewhat shocked at but my partner had ordered the lobster. Oh at they said they had taken 10% off for forgetting my mains. All in all we would NOT recommend this restaurant as there is far better ones out there who are a hell of a lot cheaper..... And you get good service, unlike Jumbo!!
5
Not knowing the city and my phone GPS not working, it took a few contacts with others asking for the street or restaurant by name, but it is in an easy to find location. Crowded, but tables seemed to open quickly and the food arrives quite rapidly after ordering. I was thoroughly impressed with the quality and would go again in an instant.
4
Chili Crab was great!
Satay was delicious too.
But I had to eat'em all just in an hour. haha.
Service was just so so. Not very kind.
3
The food is usual - very delicious. We had- chilli crab, pepper crab, fried baby squid, sambal kang kong, scallop yam, seaweed tofu. not forgetting the refreshing dessert - honeydew sago !
food was great but price a bit steep!
4
We had to wait for.our food too long, only crab served first and we had wait more than 30minutes for.the rest. But service was good. They gave us free dessert.
5
Brought my foreigner friend here and he loved it. We reached way earlier than the reserved timing but was allowed early entry. We enjoyed the crabs very much!
5
Food was awesome and service was fast and efficient. We have enjoyed it! Can't wait to come back again.
5
The dishes were great,and that young male staff with glasses was excellent.Even though my sister can't speak english very well, he was very kind and patience.Therefore, there was a little bit inconveniences because other staffs used to take my empty dishes away as soon as I finished my meal. It causes me uncomfortable feelings. I felt like I should go out quickly.
5
I usually frequent this branch of Jumbo and would frequently bring out of town friends for the black pepper and chilli crabs. It's been a while since I last visited and I have to commend that the service has improved. Food was overall great. Thumbs up.
3
The Black Pepper Crab was excellent ( the local Sri Lanka crab was "just perfect" even though the waiter was pushing for the much more expensive Alaskan Crab .... it just sounded a terrible sales pitch. but the overall experience was also tainted by attempting to go the restroom at the end which was filthy dirty. Probably would not have eaten at the restaurant if seen that first.
1
I have longed for eating crabs in this restaurant as many people said it was good. I finally got a chance to enjoy it with my family. However the service was was poor. They always tried to push you to order and make payment strategically since there were many customers waiting for tables. The service in this kind of restaurant can be regard as poor.
5
We tried booking with Jumbo Riverside Point branch but it was almost fully booked so we ended up booking with this Jumbo Riverwalk branch. It was slightly quieter over this area compared with Riverside Point. The food was excellent though quite a number of dishes were sold out. I recommend booking more than a week earlier to secure an earlier reservation
4
The crab is fantastic but so too is the other dishes such as the fish with ginger and soy. Its a very busy restaurant and could do with a good clean up but the food makes the experience here.
5
It can pay with Alipay and have Alipay coupon, which is very convenient for Chinese. The on line booking system is also fantastic.
5
Easy and excellent service with chope reservation. The restaurant has arranged what I have requested upon reservation even they are full. The restaurant staffs are efficient and I like the staff service who call Michelle.
4
Everything has been fine although the crab was not big enough as we need.
Cereal prawns are also yummy.
4
Recomment Chilli Crab, Crispy-fried Baby Squid, Deep-fried Mini Bun. It's excellent. Wait not too long after order.
2
The food was OK, but a little disappointing because of high expectations. The restaurant was busy as expected, and even though we reserved a table we got this small table almost on the sidewalk. Prices were poorly informed, and they added stuff on the bill that they didn't tell us about beforehand. The bathroom was really dirty and reeked of urine. Very disappointing experience
3
staff at the receiving counter shouting at another staff. served tea without asking what type of tea we want. ordered our food but they took the wrong order and did not order what we want. their service from bad to worse.and very noisy..it is like everyone shouting on top of each other
5
You should eat the Singoporean Chillie Crab because it is big enough for 3-4 people. You could get a bun to dip it into the delicious gravy. Also the cod fish is really good because it is crispy on the outside but soft on the inside and is cooked perefectly.
4
Place was crowded as always, but staff was attentive and I was brought to the table after a short wait as I have made a reservation. Got an indoor seat as requested, and I am glad that they are able to meet my request as the restaurant was crowded. Ordered and the food came shortly. Food was good and the Chili crab was fantastic. Crab is meaty and the Chili Crab sauce is well balanced, not too spicy.Halfway through eating, the staff helped us with the bib as our hands are "busy" devouring the delicious crabs. I guess they should have given us the bib right from the start, but I guess they forgot.Never the less, food was great and staff too
4
Went to Jumbo seafood on the 2nd of July with a friend from the US. There are two branches along the river. The first one was super crowded with a waiting time of 2 hours so decided to walk along and one the other one which was equally full but fortunately they have shared seating where by you share a table which seats 10 with other guest of the place so no waiting time!Went ahead and ordered 2 chilli crabs and they were amazing! The gravy was super tasty and the crabs were stone crabs I assume which was huge, at least 500g sizes. We also ordered some mantou to have with the chilli crabs and they we also amazing. Dipped them into the gravy and go for it! You won't regret coming here for their famous chilli crabs. Price was a little on the high side, a crab cost about SGD$100 each so two makes it SGD$200++ but overall we had a fantastic time and enjoyed the food plus bonus of no waiting time! Overall a very good stop
4
The food is delicious and the service is very good! The only regret is that when the package did not give the utensils, so back to the hotel did not eat😭
5
Good food, good location. Best place to enjoy Chilli Crab, a signature of Singapore. Take my family here whenever they come to Singapore
4
The foods are expensive a little. But it so delicious. and people are very kind, shop is very clean.
5
The food served is not only Yummy but fresh, excellent service provided. Nice and clean environment.
5
Nice , good services , reasonable price , sure will visit again if go to Singapore , but more choice of food will be better
4
This is our family restaurant as we will definitely go a few times every year. Food was good as usual but as the years go by, the pricing is getting steeper.
4
We were there on Saturday 6pm. Restaurant is full with mostly tourists, was quite nice to see so many people enjoying dinner there. We specially love the Mee goreng (fried noodle) and Chilli crab. We ordered 2 pieces of Crab which means about 2.2kg for 4 adults, can't finish, hence pack home for next day dinner. Kids ordered fried rice with egg as they don't appreciate seafood yet. Spinach with 3 types of eggs also yummy. Fried 'man tou' is good to go with the Chilli crab gravy. Serving of drinks were slow, took 15 minutes and several reminders for a glass of coke. Serving of food is fast. Bill SGD260 for 4 adults 2 kids, 2 pcs Chilli crab, 14 pcs man tou, 8 pcs pumpkin prawn, a medium Mee goreng, a small fried rice, a small spinach, 2 glasses of coke.
4
We chose Menu for 4 person and we think not enough for us (because we are 6) so we add more 2 portion of mini buns (1 portion is 6 buns) and scallop Brocoli.But We Wrong, the Menu for 4 person is more than enough for 6 person. And The Chilli Crab is still the best for me
3
There will be a line outside for dinner... they help it as well making unnecessary delays so they make big deal of it. As soon as you go in, you are on clock to finish and leave so they can turn table again. Now tips, go for food per person and ask to bring one by one otherwise1, if you order to share this will never be exact portion per person that is what resaurants are doing to make more money....2, if you order meal individually and you do not say, they will bring you complete order at same time i. e. Starter, main course dessert, all togetherService in rush hours at evening barely coping. Have patience while explaining order.So if you can be on time and leave on time ( ha, if you exceed time, they will try to give you discount on food in order that you leave...) go for it...Food was good, but not worth all this hassle, even more if you are dinning at outside tables, very hot and humid.Lastly, they have 5 of these in Singapore and 5 min walk of this one there is another one Jumbo seafood....Beer we did not drink, wine insanelly expensive
2
More than one staff, either directly or indirectly, kept reminding us that we had to finish our dinner by 8.15pm. It wasn't about whether we could finish our dinner by that time, but it wasn't as if we get a discount for finishing our dinner earlier, as I am also paying for a dining experience similar to other patrons, and is not as if I intend to sip tea through the night if not given a time limit. And at 7.40pm the staff came to tell us that if we wanted to place any more orders we would have to place it then, otherwise we wouldn't be able to finish our dinner by 8.15pm. Jumbo needs to know that we are not paying for food just to fill our stomachs, but having dinner is an experience to be enjoyed, otherwise we should be eating at the hawker center -- eat and go off.
4
Food was served promptly, value for money , the quality and quantity were good . Service was good too !
5
I had guests from Korean for the business.
They had enjoyed food and service with satisfaction.
Thanks for your services.
4
The timing is not enough for us. As need to go off at 1.5 hrs. No choice to chat. Not very enjoyable, very rushing to eat
5
Service was great, food was of good quality, but the price was slightly on a very highly priced, as JUMBO has obviously is too touristy
5
chili crab with bun are always my favorites all times. Every times we got oversea guests visit we must bring them to Jumbo.
4
Went back to our favorite seafood place for another round of Chili Crab with an overseas visitor and ordered a Black Pepper Crab as well.When we received the dishes after approx. 20 minutes, the crab was very different to what we were used to. Fortunately for us, a table next to us had also ordered a crab, which looked like what we had always gotten before when ordering crab.When we asked one of the staff why our crab was so much different from the other table, it turned out that what we were served the Jumbo Crab whereas the other table was given a Sri Lanka Crab!The latter used to be the default for many years and you were always served that type of crab unless you explicitly ordered an Alaskan Crab.This obviously has changed and the default is now the Jumbo Crab. This crab is much smaller and does not seem to have a lot of meat like the Sri Lanka Crab.I did not check the menu for the difference in price.The Chili Crab was once again fantastic in taste. The Black Pepper Crab tasted more like a White Pepper Crab and the taste was not as good for our liking from our usual experience here.To give credit to the restaurant, they exchanged our order after we had enquired about the difference and allowed us an extra 15 minutes of dining time due to the delay.All in all, we left the restaurant happy and our visitor was very pleased with the typical Singapore dining experience of this 'Must Have' dish.We will certainly return but make sure to explicitly order the Sri Lankan Crab to continue enjoying our dining experience
3
To be honest, $78/kg for crabs was quite a ridiculous pricing but because I had guests from overseas, we decided to go for it as we liked the atmosphere of the restaurant by the river. We ordered a Chilli Crab that was about 1.2kg in weight but the crab was not big and wasn't enough for 3 persons. It was fresh and nicely cooked though. Taste wise, the gravy was good and not overly starchy. Delicious pairing with fried mantou.We also had Scallop with Yam and Spinach Tofu - both of which were decent. Wanted to order Bamboo Clams but was told they were out of stock.While I understood there was a time limit for the meal because the restaurant had patrons coming for staggered seatings, it wasn't fair to rush us off when we had to wait for a long time for the food to come, particularly the Chilli Crab. And while my guests were still eating crabs with their hands, one of the staff shoved the bill in front of their faces and my guests weren't very happy about it.As a Singaporean myself, I am greatly appalled at such service extended by a well-known local seafood restaurant which truly was only interested in earning more profits.Unlikely to come back for crabs again. Would rather go for the Sri Lankan crabs at another restaurant on Sembawang Road which are more value for money at $35/kg
4
I prefer this outlet black pepper much more then the east coast branch. This outlet cooking style more suitable for us! The only con is that we only had a timing slot of 2hrs to eat not like over in east coast can sit and drink after finishing dinner.
3
Jumbo has never disappointed me with the food, even when ordering delivery. But the service was lackluster I had made a reservation and was chucked into a corner table very very near the service areas. never mind that, because we all know it is a crowdes restaurant. but the staff taking my order was in a hurry and inattentive. we had to remind abt rice a few times and drinks were not topped up unless we asked. It was a rushed affair, like, "pls eat and get out". Dun Tai Fung is always crowded and busy but staff still make an effort to greet u and tend to your needs. Amazing food, but service staff need to be more service-oriented... after all, the prices arent cheap either
4
We had been told we must have Chili Crab so we chose Jumbo Seafood. They provide bibs - which are necessary. The service was quick. One crab was enough for two of us. It was tender and tasty. The Chili sauce was great, not as rich as butter, so it was easy to eat it all! We had the steamed dumplings to go along with it
5
We left something there and the staff found out quickly. The food is yummy. There is a box of gift if you order a set menu. Good!
5
The day that i visited was my birthday ，so the food and service had given me lots of beautiful memories.I hope that I could visit JUMBO Seafood Gallery again before next birthday.
4
Good place to have a dinner with family and better if reserve before go out that you no need to queue
5
It's easy to book and save time and you can manage time for travel.
I am very happy and enjoining eating.
5
Superb service and marvelous food. I requested a riverside table at 6PM and i got all my request. Also aprons for 2 and a cloth to cover up my belongings, so impressive!
4
The taste of chilly crab was really amazing, the service however could be better!
Would recommend to friends visiting Singapore
5
The food is good and the atmosphere is great. I ate myself but the servers still treated me nice. Appreciate it.
4
Good but waiting long.. crab so big but expensive... overall good taste.. Must able to wait and eat fast.. Good....
2
Finished dinner, I felt so hot cuz there was outside table. So I asked to pay right now but clack said just "Wait." and they rejected us to enter indoor restaurant. How could it be? Also I got my meal for twice order. No way dude..
5
You wouldn't believe this was one of my top meals in Singapore; specially when the city has a boasting and diverse Fine Dining Scene. I didn't expect to like Singapore's most famous dish, Chilli Crab, so much! I assumed it was a tourist trap (which it kinda was). To add to my skepticism, Singaporean friends had commented that the sauce and condiments of the Chilli Crab undermined or overpowered the flavor of the Crab. Well let me tell you that I ordered the King Crab (obviously not from Singapore) and had it half Chilli and half Black Pepper. The crab itself was amazing; both in its quality and flavor. Furthermore, both preparations were delicious! Truth be told the only appetizer I ordered, baby squid, was quite lame. But next time I visit Singapore I'll definitely drop by probably just for crab again! Which is the main reason I'm recommending this place so much!
4
I'd guests from Canada and they're not disappointed in fulfilling their chili crab craving. The only drawback is that the sitting was timed to 1 hour and 15 minutes. They relented to an additional 15 minutes when we requested.
5
Went to this outlet to celebrate my dad's birthday. The signature chili crab are very nice. It's better to make a reservation online especially on the weekend cause you might need to wait quite some time for a table.
5
Get together was fantastic. Was so smooth from planning, getting our table to the service. The food was fantastic to say the leastt
4
The food was very good but the reception told us that we have to finish by 8.30 pm (Our reservation wa at 7.00 pm) I wish they could manage their reservation schedule better !!
5
Keep visit this outlet for many times, both food and service are excellent and never made me disappointed. Great restaurant!
4
We usually go to the Riverside Point branch but since it was fully booked on Mothers Day, we came here instead. Food quality is very similar to RP. Staff is also very accommodating in helping with GF dishes.
4
Tried Chili crab, crispy baby squid and salted egg yolk prawn. Ate salted egg yolk prawn at the outlet down the road the next day. This one had a bit of a mushy coating. It tasted better at Riverside as the coating was crispier.
3
Crab and prawns was fresh. Fried rice was good. Dessert: Pomelo mango wasn't so nice. Price was on the high side.
5
We booked the private room and received attentive service such as changing of plates and refilling of tea and beverages.
All my guests were very satisfied with the food and service and even recommend to come back in future.
3
Despite having reservation & abiding by the 1:15 hour imposed time limit, we endured service staff hovering impatiently around us and warning us about time. We had to ask for bill 1 min before time was up. We ordered 3 dishes and they made us feel like we did not order enough. It was more than enough. Food was ok but as an avid home cook my singapore lobster/crab is better. Only one washroom in whole place. Are there not laws about that? Poor service makes good food taste less good
5
We ordered steamed and pepper mud crabs, they were excellent! The crabs were yummy and very fresh. Tough the restaurant was packed, the staff were attentive and nice.
4
Always can count on Jumbo for a satisfying crab meal. Not cheap, but best value for money. Will go back.
5
Crowded with tourists, but worth the wait and visit ( Recommend that advance reservation be made ). Chilli Crab and the Sea Food fried rice is an absolute must. The service was quick & efficient and the location is convenient.
5
Food was very fresh & tasty and good value for money. The staff was helpful and friendly. The location is very convenient. All in all, I loved it!
3
The restaurant is very crowded, no matter weekdays or weekend.
It is crowded with tourist especially the 2 outlets (Riverside Point and The Riverwalk)
They are famous with Chilli crab (can order bun to eat with the sauce).
5
Brought some non-Singaporean friends to eat here and they couldn't stop raving about every dish even long after we finished eating! Would definitely come here again. Too bad the bamboo clams were sold out =(
4
Nice food and beaware of the address, i will come and visit next time and try more food, specially the oat shrimps and crabs
4
Had a business dinner here and not for the first time and always I must say my guests enjoy a lot the spectacular view on the river as the tasty local crabs in spicy chilly sauce and in the black pepper one.Along with a fruit juice and a shared lobster starter you can spend about 100 sgd per person. Not cheap but we are in Singapore!
4
The chili crab is very nice. It cost around 80sgd per kg.. 1 Crab is around 800grams.The only problem is when we ask for cold water, it took 3 staff before we are actually receive the water.Overall experience is good but a bit pricey
3
We had both black pepper and chilli crabs and both turned out pretty good. However, the cereal prawns which we have ordered aren't too fresh. The rest of the vegetables dishes are not served hot as well. A constantly packed and crowded restaurant but I still suggest that they improve the quality of other dishes except crabs.
5
service staff is good but they need to manage the q better. ppl just walk to them at the q podium cutting q.
4
Taste good,but the environment is too hot outside! Must book in advance. The coconut juice is weird.
5
Chill crab is really deciloius. It is easy to get there as it is located in Clarke Quay. You can either grab a taxi or take MRT then walk around 10mins to get there.
5
My family and I enjoyed the quality of the food and services!!! High value for high quality! Thumbs up!
4
My guest was happy with the service and the waiter (Chen Bin - not sure if his name is correct)is very attentive to our table. Good job!
5
It was so delicious. It was the most memorable meal on my trip to Singapore.
I plan to come back next time I visit Singapore.
4
Decent portion. Small portion for carb and veggie is enough for 3 females. Server can provide better estimate for customer on the crab size. Overall nice food.
3
Went there on my wife's birthday on our first trip to Singapore.First thing told by the restaurant when we are about to get to our seat was that we have to get out by 9pm with our booking at 7:30pm. While I have no issue with the time as there were only 2 of us, it would have been good if at time of booking this was stipulated.From then onward it felt like we were on the clock for the rest of the dinner which really destroyed the atmosphere (would have ordered the black pepper crab if I did not feel so rushed), but the food was fantastic and the chilli crab was a standout. The service team there did their job in a very efficient manner; being robotic and emotionless in order to get us out of the door as quick as they can. Things like providing us with the bill when our deserts were yet to be served, as well as checking for time when we were ready to pay (by then we wanted to leave anyway).For a place where patrons are charged with an automatic service surcharge of 10% this restaurant really need to improve their service
2
No one of the server smiles to us or greet us. We made a reservation but had to wait for another 5mins. I asked for the bill, and it made me wait for 5mins, also for the change after pay, needed another 5mins. While I was waiting for bill and change, the server was just standing and taking care of other people. Never say sorry, hello, bye, or smile. Service was worst among the restaurants in SG
4
We went to Jumbo Seafood Gallery for the award winning chilli crab. We arrived there around 6pm and did not have to wait too long for a table. A long queue was formed shortly after we sat down. Before our table was arranged, we were asked to agree to finish our dinner in 90 minutes. We took the outdoor seating by the river. The views were great. The chilli crab was tasty. The dinner was enjoyable despite the rush
5
one hour for dinner is too short that crab was so big!would like to order more and more different wonderful food~~~~
5
That's a correct choice to taste JUMBO. Sri Lanka crab have more meat,although tiny.Those prices are worth it.JUMBO(river walker) is easy to find,A whitebridge close to her.
5
We visit Jumbo everytime when we visit Singapore, it's always the highlight of our trip! This Jumbo Branch adds value on the nice view near the Singapore River.
4
Food is great but becoming more expensive. Sambal kang kong is one of the best I have eaten. Pepper crab is definitely better than the chili crab.
5
The chili crab and black pepper crab were so good! A must place to try when you come to Singapore. The online booking reservation is very convenient.
3
It's over price just for the name
I enjoyed it but once is enough
To see what is the fuss about
Many other places taste just as good for much cheaper
4
Great seafood, though if having crabs and booked the earlier seating, you really need to know what to order straight away or you'll feel rushed for the dinner.
3
food always good as usual, im not satisfied with the service,some staff nv smile when talking to me.
4
This is our first time visiting Jumbo Seafood and we enjoyed Choli crab a lot! Everything was excellent but only one concern is about waiting time of chili crab. We seated at 19:30 by understood that we need to finish our meal and leave at 20:45 so we ordered quickly and waited for our food. However, Chili crab came at 20:15 which mean we have only 30mins to eat that big crab. I don't know if this happened to everyone but for us this was very hurriedly meal. Anyway foods we ordered were delicious and of course next time to Sinhapore we will visit here again
5
This was the perfect place for our first dinner in Singapore. Outside by the riverwalk, the location has its charm. We ordered one of the set menus and would recommend it as opposed to ordering each dish separately. The quantity was perfect for the two of us. We had a duck salad, fried rice, oriental vegetable and - of course - chili crab! Delicious! Dessert was included and it was one of those shaved ice with fruit, juice and those gummy sweet noodles. Also very nice and very typical. This place is totally recommendable
5
All dishes were very very tasty! The staff is very very polite and helpful. For seafood eaters this place is MUST visit.
5
The place is very easy to find the crab is very delicious we had a very good time there and I will go next time thank you
5
Set lunch was value for money and taste was good. However staff service could be even better if they had carried more smiles and friendlier.
5
The food taste very nice, but the pice is a bit expensive then imagine, and the environment is a bit hot, which i have the reservation but still cannot sit indoor, quite disappointed for me.
5
A bit pricy but really good food and as tasty as usual
Seafood is fresh.
Did not get an indoor table, so a bit hot
5
We ordered three types of crabs - chili, black pepper and salted egg. All tasty!
Jumbo Seafood is still one of the best seafood restaurant in Singapore!
5
It's so delicious that deep fried mini bun with sauce of chili crab!!! The smaller chili crab is about 1.2 kg, we two had a great dinner even without any rice or noodle. Shrimps with cereal was sweet that's totally different from our imagination~ it's also delicious. The restaurant is too difficult to get a table, reservation is definitely required!! Servers are good in chinese, in fact, the order list are all with chinese
5
On this occasion, not only was the food excellent as always, this time we also had the pleasure of experiencing excellent service!While the place was crowded as usual on a Friday night, our waitress went the extra mile to provide excellent and very attentive service.It was certainly matching the special occasion of our dinner
5
We had a last minute catch up with a friend at Jumbo Riverwalk and it was just as good as our previous visits. A bit quieter at lunchtime but that didn't make the food any less incredible. And you still need to book. We had the famous chilli crabs (which are equally as amaze as the black pepper crab) with fried rice, crispy skin chicken and greens in garlic. A perfect combination of flavours - all very light and tasty so you can eat heaps of it. Service is good (not personal or amazing but fine) and you won't get out of there much under $100 a person. But well worth the experience. We'll definitely be back again.

We ate Chili Crab, Black Pepper Crab, some others. They taste as good as other reviewers mentions. Their services are OK. The restaurant is too popular to make a reservation. If you really want to try Chili Crab there in the weekend, I recommend you make a reservation at least one week before the date you plan to be there. The most important thing I must share is that the restaurant is pricey
3
The restaurant was fine....not outstanding. Location is near Clark Quay. They have both indoor and outdoor seating.
4
Went there with my Girlfriend and the service is fast and good not forgetting the food as well. The only setback is the dinner time has a limitation due to the huge crowds on Friday night and weekend.
5
It was very nice chill-crab.
I was afraid of service of this restourant but It was nice as well.
I hope visiti again

Good quality seafood cooked deliciously, decent and attentive table service, acceprable restaurant deco, questionable toilets as not very clean.
5
I went to this restaurant with my family.
This restaurant is convenient transportation .
I wanted like to eat King crab but there was sold out.
So,I ordered 2 Mad crab.The flavor was same as King crab.
4
We made a reservation (need to make a reservation) and were seated promptly. The waiter Marcus was very patient and made good recommendations for our meal.It was a hopping place with everyone eating crab and other delicious dishes. The beef with onions was very tender and the prawns were very fresh
5
I went there alone at lunch. It was hot outside, so i asked for the seat inside. They clarified that they are fully booked. But after i sat down, i didn't feel hot any more because they had sufficient air-conditioner power outside as well. When i took the order, they stopped me when i finished my third dish order and told me that's enough for single. And i explained that i was going to take away my dinner as well. SO Considerable of them! At last, i even receive a screen-cleaner doll as gift. Sweeeet

The only restaurant I pre-booked before leaving Australia and what a let down. The restaurant was very busy as was expected, the wait staff were not very well conversed in 'English' so the questions we were asking were very difficult to get an answer to, the price per Kg of the 'Chilli crab' was $75kg and to honest we got more crab shell in the sauce than actual crab that you could enjoy which was so unpleasant as you had to scrap the sauce off the crab to you didn't break a tooth! The cereal prawns we ordered as they were also highly recommended by travelers and were way too flavorsome and must have been laced with MSG as my Son and I only had one to know not to go back for a second. The venison dish was nice but that was it and the' boiled rice was a hit' and for those 3 dishes and 2 glasses of 'soft drink' the bill was over $165.00!! Not worth it folks - rookie error, all the people we know that have been to Singapore all said make sure you go to Jumbo's and the girl at the travel exchange getting my money - wrote down a tip for me and when I got home it was also recommending Jumbo's!!! Update your reviews people - no no no!! Have absolutely no idea why it was so busy, I would say 20% only looked like tourists, the others looked like business people, confused us immensely. Felt very cheated out of our money as my Son and I were so hungry when we left, cause we left all the eating up to my Husband cause we just didn't enjoy it and nor did my Husband but he said he was paying for it so he ate it. Staff were not hospitable at all except for the lovely man who cleared our table, the lady with the bill literally watched over my Husbands shoulder as he signed off for the 'bill amount' only, and she was quite annoyed there was no tip. The restaurant vibe was good though, not sure what they were enjoying cause it wasn't what we were having. Also not one person asked if our meal was ok, or are we enjoying our food even though it sat on the table with only one person picking at it. Grossly disappointed. Will definitely go back to Singapore but not to visit Jumbo'

You will be surprised by the efficiency of restaurant. The SOP is in place to ensure that you have a no fuss dinning experience. The services staff are like Robots and they will serve you in a fast and cold manner. The food is served within minutes once you make your order. This will make you wonder, whether the dishes are microwave prepared. The food does not taste as good as it used to be and you can tell that they are being mass produce in the kitchen. I do suspect the dishes are pre-cook and place in some buffet trays in the kitchen. They will scoop the dish on to a plate and heat up using the microwave oven when the dish is ordered.This will be a place to go to if you want FAST seaFOOD

Chili Crab is fat, too beautiful to eat bibimbap sauce. Li Rong Scallop in Shell sauce is sweet, if with chili sauce is good. BBQ King prawns delicious, very fresh. Satay chicken partial sweet, do not like. Jade tofu is also very good, very tender. Overall, the dishes are delicious and fresh. But the feeling of environment is not another good riverside square
1
We ordered a set menu. But the crab was so skinny and taste just ok. Other food is just so so. Overall, the food quality is not worthed the money we paid. We will never go back there again for their set menu.
5
Had early dinner with our toddler in tow- staff was very friendly and accommodating! Food was delicious- crab and the bread were definitely the go-to dishes though all the others we had were pretty delicious.
4
Just went there to have chilli crab which was tasty enough, more sweet than spicy though. Service was average.
5
You must must must try the chilli crab! It s absolutely yummy yummy yummy! 😍 You go here for the food... the location is ok and the service is mostly friendly, definitely efficient. Just focus on the chilli crab.
4
Got the set meal for 4 pax. Food was served almost immediately and service is good. Waiter was attentive!
5
the food is very nice really really nice and the service is good. The craps are big and delicious. Very good experience.
5
The restaurant is just at the riverbank and you can enjoy the night view of Clark Quay. The Chilli crab tastes so yum.Although the price is quite high but it is definitely worth a try!
4
Food is good. Taste is excellent.
Need a bit more service and attention to foreign customer like me.

I have been to 4 of the Jumbo outlets now and the food here is just as good as the other's. I was concerned about the intelligence of the wait staff however. I was the first of my party of 6 to arrive and just sat down at the table alone. Less than 30 seconds after sitting (still alone at a table of 6), the waiter ran over and rudely asked me if I was ready to order. I had yet to open the menu and I had not signaled in any way. While he was distracting me, another woman swooped in to pour tea that I did not want without asking (because it is an extra charge). When the rest of my party arrived, we ordered a jug of Tiger beer that took about 30 minutes to arrive. When we were ready to place our food order, all of the waitstaff completely ignored us. I understand that the restaurant is busy, but there was at least one staff for every table running around, so they definitely weren't short on people.Although the food is good, I would recommend going to the East Coast outlet instead, they are much more sane there.
4
We were a group of 20 on a Wednesday evening. Busy restaurant so best to book ahead for large groups. Great vibe and efficient service. Delicious chilli and pepper crabs as well as cereal coated prawns. Beer and a decent wine list. Suitable for all types of diners. Great value. Plenty of bars nearby for pre or post drinks
5
Thanks you for VIP room in JUMBO SEAFOOD RiverWalk.
And meet a waitress who from Taiwan too.
Very thank so much.
4
Food is good, the chili crab is delicious. The online reservation makes it convenient for planning, staff are friendly and service is good.
5
Second time in Singapore and second time in Jumbo. Never had better crabs both chilli and pepper anywhere else! What an experience! Recommended to everyone
3
food is good, worth the money. service is nice. place is easy to find nearby the city river. but have to book your table in advance. otherwise, wait for a long queue.
5
Great chilli crab but too pricey and there's no menu online I get 900 gr crab for $80 before service n gst
4
I used to go to the riverpoint Jumbo, however, Seafood gallery is more flexible and less crowded but with same quality of good food. you can also get nice serve. I will choose seafood gallery for the next time.
5
Great food especially the chilli crab! must try for every family gathering. chinese cuisine that loves by everyone even the foreigners like us. this is a must visit restaurant in singapore. great food although not cheap but overall worth every cents. Recommended for every tourist. a must try. its location is also good. i recommended dinner in this restaurant.
2
I have been a supporter for many years but this experience had been bad. Not that the food was bad but the experience dinning in the restaurant was bad. Upon arriving at the restaurant, I was told I will only have 1hr 15 minutes to complete my meal, it appears I don't have choice or be turned away. This wasn't made clear when we reserved the restaurant. It was really 1hr 15 minutes coz we are being monitored. Once we hit 1hr 15 minutes, The captain immediately appeared and asked whether we are ready to pay the bill. Its not a seafood restaurant anymore, it feels like a fast food restaurant. All 4 decided we will not visit Jumbo again and will no longer renew our memberships. We have to rush through the meal and could not really connect with friends. Food is getting expensive yet there are restrictions. Its now a tourist joint instead
5
This is the place to be for chilli crab. The restaurant is packed, you have to make a reservation, and you might need to wait when you get there, but this is totally worth it! You can't be in Singapore and not have had the famous chilli crab
2
I have booked Jumbo originally for 7:30pm. However, I never received any email or SMS for a week. I tried to call them, which failed after 20 calls. Therefore, I tried to book again on-line and successfully booked at 6pm and received an email. I left remarks to indicate to cancel 6pm reservation if 7:30 was already booked. However, i never received any call or email. We were there at Jumbo Riverwalk at 6pm on the day and was told that our booking was 7:30. Eventually we were able to start at 6pm. But this was embarrassment in front of guests and there was so much confusion.
2
Took friends and family for local seafood. No service at all and many of them sold out. Yet they charged wet tissue and peanuts that we actually asked to send it back. Seafood is over price and quality is ok.
4
a little bit salty for us but really delicious. i don't like crabs but this restaurant crab is really good so i like it.
5
Good meal, nice environment , good tasty, good location and very nice service , we will come again int he future. But the price is litte bit high, would appreciated can adjust the price.
4
Two people spent two hundred Singapore dollars, ate a plan B. Taste good, the environment is generally
1
Very rude service and the atmosphere was more like a fast food lunch restaurant and not a place to have dinner. The price level (ate the chili crab) did not meet the quality of the food.
4
A popular restaurant and a local but delicious and gorgeous has excellent seafood and good but the price is high.
Service is good but the restaurant crowded
5
Crab is delicious but price is expensive.We went to riverwalk on 26th Jan，2017，it's Chinese new year.
5
My family all like JUMBO,very good! Chili Crab is very delicious, oatmeal shrimp is very special, very memorable food experience, will be recommended to our friends.
5
First time of visiting singapore. It was awesome having best dishes in town! Already missing this restaurant.
3
We had pepper crab based on various reviews/blogs but were a little disappointed, not sure what all the fuss is about. Reservations required, walk-ups given a number and asked to wait around. Most of the tourists sitting outside were having crab dishes, the locals inside something else. Crab is expensive (everywhere we're likely to find
4
worth to try!
Although the price is a bit expensive
but the taste is good. And the service is not bad as well
4
better reserved the table ahead, the preparation time for the food took a bit long under the 2-hour dinner period.
5
The food is delicious，especially the Cereal Prawns.I love it very much. The price is a little expensive
4
Pricey a bit.portions huge especially the rice.pls order medium better.try get private room if no extra cost.
4
To much people,very noisy but the service was excellent.The only things they need to improve is that they need to ask if the consumer need nuts and tea,and wait for the answer.But overall it is a fantastic dinning experience.
5
Super service, big portions, nice ambience, great place, worth the experience, a must, families, business a must
4
The crabs are really great, the staffs are friendly and the atmosphere is great! Great place for family and friends gathering!
4
The food is great but you certainly pay for it.It was my first visit, we booked & got there early because we were in the first sitting.We still had to wait on the sidewalk for 30 mins until our time slot - it was the first sitting so no one was in the air-con section. Apparently the chefs get too overwhelmed if they are too many people at once (you kind of get that if you do "sittings").It would have been much better and far better customer service if we sat inside eating the peanuts & drinking tea (which are all chargeable) and being told about the kitchen capacity rather than having to ask. It was a bit like queuing for fast food at a big event.Also, the veggie dish came out 15 mins before the others so was cold when the other dishes arrive.The food is up there, but the way they run it is not - would have been cheaper to eat in at Marina Bay Sands and the service would have been 5 star too
4
The black pepper crab was delicious! This place gets very crowded and dont expect too much attention from the staff. They are nice and work really hard but the place is just too busy. Well worth the wait and the premium on price. They also have an onsite reservation system where you register and get a text message on your phone when your table is ready. Caveat is you have 5 minutes to get back to the restaurant and claim your table. But at least you dont have to sit around waiting
2
Jumbo is probably the most popular place if you are looking for Singapore's famous dish 'chilli crab'. No doubt you will be very happy with its taste (not only chilli crab but other dish). However, over all, I was very disappointed with this place... even if you make a reserv, you have to finish your food within 1.15 hours. I brought my customer there and bf we finish our food they asked us to leave.. and of course I had to apologies to my dear customer... making money is important but jumbo should consider their customers too.... jumbo deserves its bad reputation.
4
Good location, good food. However crab price was very pricey - $88/1kg and it was quite hard to get the waiter's attention as the restaurant was very busy.
2
Waiting seemed to ignore customers, had to wave to them to clear table & replenish tea. They were more interested in their own conversation, talking among themselves.
4
Good environment but no view. Dinner time is too short (only 1.5hr). Good and friendly service. Most foods are good, but grabs are not very delicious.
4
The food is good but the service is lacking details example: dirty table dishes were not replaced until asked.
4
This was our first experience of chilliCrab. It was very tasty. The restaurant is large and has a bit outsoor area alongaide the river but it was very busy. We had to take a ticket and wait to be seated. Sign of a good restaurant. RegardsOma
1
1 crab for 2 people costs 88 singapore dollar. we ordered 1 crabs, 1 shrimps , 1 rice and 2 drinks total about euro 150 ! but the service and feeling is like eating on the street of night market. Especially the food is so so. There are much more delicious food and good restairant with cheaper price in Singapore. Especially I saw many Taiwanese blog and review which you must try this restaurant. I should not trust it, very regreat. Among all my trip in Singapore and Kuala lumpur, to come to this restaurant make me feel the most not worthy and regreat
2
Went with colleagues after work. Set dining hours are 5:30pm until 8:00pm and 8:00pm onward. I intensely dislike any restaurant that imposes start and end times for me, especially at these prices!Service was rapid (as one might expect when they want you out).They bring tea and a tiny bowl of peanuts. What they neglect to tell you, is that these are chargeable, even though you didn't order them!! Unbelievable. 2 SGD for the tiniest bowl of peanuts!Chilli Crab and Black Pepper Crab dishes were nice.We had one jug of beer between four people.Two crab dishes, one jug of beer @ 300 SGD!First and last time for me at Jumbo
4
Book ahead a must or be prepared to wait a long time. Tables turn over quickly and diners have about an hour once seated to eat and depart. Food does however come quickly so there is no real issue with this. Black pepper crab is excellent so ensure you wear nothing white if going for a crab feast. Well worth a visit
3
Food at Jumbo as always is good but service is a little lacking. Not too happy with captain who took our orders. We ordered more than 10 dishes for 9 people and he advised us to take medium sized dishes for all. All the dishes were sizes for 9 people as if we ordered only one or two dishes. You can imagine how stuffed we all were
4
I think I could eat every day at Jumbo Seafood and never get tired of the cuisine. Actually, when I spend a week in Singapore, I eat a whole lot of black pepper crab and garlic prawns. Normally I enjoy seafood at the East Coast Seafood Centre, but going to the Riverwalk is a lot easier, because I donâ€™t wait for a taxi back to the hotel. The subway is so convenient.Jumbo is always busy, which is why reservations are so important. The service is usually pretty good, although at times rushed. For this night, we stayed with the black pepper crabs and garlic prawns. The prawns in Singapore are huge and have a great color. And the ones we had that night were outstanding. We had to order a second order. This is a very good restaurant
5
Restaurant was cleaner than other location. Sauce was awesome.
The only problem was there were not any big crab at 9 pm so we couldn't have enough dinner.
5
Chill club is very delicious!!
Another foods are delicious,too.
Nice experience.but,beer is expensive.
4
The set dinner menu for 2 is value for money, with signature chilli crab and other dishes. In fact, I got to take away the fried rice home... the food is up to the neck !!! Great food and efficient!
5
-book restaurant via their homepage before your visit
-arrive there 10mins earlier, not to late since it can only be kept for 5mins
-must try black pepper crab even if you're not a big fan of spicy food
4
Overall, we love the food especially the Chili crab but the price is at the higher side for the crab. The service crew are attentive as well and they are willing to serve you with a smile.
3
We ate black pepper crab . The taste is not so deliciuos. The singapore chili crab also not too good. As the price is quiet expensive...
3
The plate we were using for food was quite small. The service was terrible; it seemed like the workers did not want to work. Also, some workers were ignoring us when we called them.
4
We had a table booked for 7.30pm. On arrival very clearly told that the table had another sitting at 8.45pm. That was fine. Food - Chiili Crab, black pepper beef and egg fried prawn some of the best we have had, very very good. However it did feel a bit as though you were on a production line. I would recommend though
4
Brought family seafood fanatics on recommendation for the signature dish and was not disappointed. The crab was sweet, fresh and flavoursome.Noisy, fast and efficient, as you'd expect in Singapore. The restaurant works on seatings i.e. get in, eat, pay, get out :)We went on a weeknight and it was busy with locals (a good sign). Outside tables are good if you don't mind Singa weather. We lucked out and got a balmy evening following the rain that can be typical of this time of year.Not cheap (its Singapore) and not the place to go for a 'fine dining' experience but we give it the thumbs up as a Singapore experience that delivers
3
Food at a jumbo is always good, since I've been eating there frequently. This time, it was with friends visiting and we were celebrating the new year. We ordered the pepper crabs, sambal kangkong, spinach, and fried baby squid. The food taste great, as you would expect from Jumbo, but the portion were surprising. We were 4, and with that many dishes ordered the small and when it come, it was comfortably sufficient for 2. Each of us had small bites of each dish. The price versus the amount of food is not value for money. My guests commented on it too. Great as an introduction to overseas guests but as a fellow Singaporean, I wouldn't go back. Not worth the price to pay.
3
They gave tea and peanut to us without notification and they want us to pay them.
So we couldn't pay them.
5
Ordered 2 Sri Lankan Crabs - Chili and Black Pepper about 800 grams each. The sauce and the freshness is really good. The ambiance is nice with the "river" view. Service staff were good too. Excellent seafood to go place.
5
It is Very good experience for me,sea food are very delicious and the space was very comfortable ,I love this restaurant
2
Poor attitude , terrible response, Bad service, I think this store should revise your customer manual.
5
Reservations was well noted and promptly settled into our table. Food order was fast and friendly service staff

I have tried Chilli Crab before, but never in Singapore, and quite a few seafood restaurants in that city claim the distinction of having the best.I decided to try Jumbo Gallery, as a number of people whose judgement and taste I value had advised me that this was the real deal.And they were right!Absolutely the most delicious Chilli Crab I have ever had.The creamy smooth, rich, piquant sauce had just enough heat to give the dish a zing, but not enough to overpower the fresh and subtle flavour of the generously sized crab.It is a big meal for one person, but once started, I guarantee that you will clean the plate up!It is so good as to be almost addictive!Sitting there with an over-sized bib around your neck, using your fingers encased in plastic gloves to gnaw and slurp on luscious crab and sauce, makes you feel something of a Charles Laughton Henry the Eighth character.But what the hell!Eating crab and following the niceties of formal table etiquette are mutually exclusive in my opinion!The prices for the crabs are based on seasonal market rates, so be prepared for a reasonably hefty price tag. My crab dish cost S$62.50.Also, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes for the dish to be freshly prepared.But the wait and the price are worth it!This was a truly delicious meal
1
We came for the chilly crab which we enjoyed. Juicy and well prepared.On the other side shark fin soup and other shark fin products are absolutely unnecessary.Without being a hypocrite but cutting the fins off a shark and throwing it back into the water to suffocate or bleed to dead is unacceptable. Hence shark finning is illegal in most countries.We just came from a week vacation in the Maldives an just saw it practiced there. Fotos attached. I am asking Jumbo's the stop serving shark fin products!
4
The food is nice and most items are reasonably priced except the crabs. After the weigh the crabs they should actually inform you the approximate price for one. Not sure whether it's high priced for festive period but our crabs cost $123 for one and $114 for the other.
1
I felt really terrible. I asked the price of menu to clerks. But they said “Just seasonal price, I don’t Know. Sorry”. Every menu were shown as seasonal price. Thus, I didn’t know the price when I paid. And cuisines are terrible. But, shrimp with cereal is not bad. The store clerks were very unfriendly. And they seemed to have fought each other. I think there seems to be nothing special. I recommend you to find other reasonable restaurants
4
Recommended to eat here by friend from Singapore. We wanted to eat casually and fancied the idea of crab. We turned up on spec on Saturday night but only had to wait 10 minutes for a sharing table - they have an efficient electronic queueing system.We had the crab plus some steamed greens. Chilli crab was delicious and not too spicey. Salt and pepper was good too if you like it a little hotter. Our only mistake was to order a dish each and it would have been better if the staff had warned us we were ordering too much, especially as it not cheap. Other than that point, a good place for impromptu dinner
3
Due to busy crowd, staff start to chase guests after one hour of dining.
They started to take away food that is not even finished. pretty rude.
4
Food was served rather quickly.
Food quality & taste remained satisfactory. The ladies toilet could have been cleaner or newer.
4
Good food, good times, good location, good place. definitely recommend for others. get the chilli crab.
4
It is famous and popular restaurant for tasting spicy crab and black pepper crab. If you are a tourist, you could try this and the restaurant is located in Clarke Quay where you can see good night river view. However it is very expensive.
5
The food at this Jumbo branch has always been good. The environment is very nice. The restaurant is always busy but the food is served on time and the service staff are attentive.
5
During our 7 day stay in Singapore we had to try the Singapore Chilli Crab here at Jumbo's. The food was served quickly and the Chilli Crab was to die for. We had 1 crab between 2 of us and there was heaps of meat and sauce it was truly amazing.Definitely recommend this dish to any tourist travelling to Singapore.The service and staff were great along with the food
1
Food is ok, crab is good, but as for non-Chinese speaking foreigners service was terrible. Also service charge 10% was automatically added to the bill, which I don't think the waitress deserve a penny. Had to wait for dessert with dirty plates in front of us which all the waiting staffs didn't bother to take or ask. Had to ask dessert multiple times which is part of 5 courses for 2 persons set dinner. Not worth 170$ bill. Also toilet is filthy dirty
4
Went to Jumbo at the Riverwalk since we are craving for crabs. The service was confusing; the staff that took our order was brusque but he later took the time to arrange the table cloth to cover our laps. Another staff was hovering then notice that we needed a smaller crab cracker (? I have no idea what it's actually called), and brought it to us without being asked. The food is great, as always, but overpriced, which I get because it's a located on a touristy area. I'd prefer to go to other restaurant for crabs (Melben comes to mind.) or chinese food
4
Excellent chilli crab, lobster and fish, all cooked to perfection. Its a hands on experience of course, but the staff will provide you with a small apron or plastic gloves if you don't want to get your hands and clothes dirty, but of course, this is half the fun. Beer is the main beverage, no spirits
1
Had a reservation for 1.15, was told last orders at 2 and mid way through eating was shoved the bill! Nobody offered to ever pour us tea. Staff barely spoke any English and portions were very tiny for the price.very embarrassing to bring any one here!!
4
Everything is good. We are very happy. Good location. Service good. Quite expensive but worth. Gooooddd
4
The crab was delicious. However it took 40 mins to have food ready. Be prepared to wait if you want a good meal
5
Good taste and good service, enjoy the food very much , we went there on time and just wait several minites.
3
Past experiences for sure have been better. Maybe too many people, but mini squid was really too fried and noodle Malay style not so bad , but not exceptional .
3
The chilli crab was good. We were seated indoors but the air conditioning was very bad and we were perspiring throughout dinner.
3
was highly recommended by a friend to try the Chilli crab at Jumbo and I must say that it was delicious and didn't disappoint.however the service was mediocre. You can tell the staff didn't want to be there and kind of made the night not as enjoyable as it should have been.
2
We were really excited to visit this restaurant, knowing the good reputation it has. I would personally avoid this branch, the staff seemed very fed up, service was painfully slow and we didn't even receive our dessert despite asking twice for it. Food wasn't anything special and we had trouble getting any money off the bill for our missing dessert! Shame as this was our first eating experience in Singapore and they really let us dow
4
Very good for business setting. I brought my guests (British and Indians) to try the famous chilli and black pepper crabs. We made the right choice to order different varieties as some prefer the black pepper to the chilli. We like the prawns with pumpkin puree too. Unfortunately, we were only given 1.5hrs for dinner. That was a bit of a rush for more drinks and desserts.
2
I have been here many times , was nice this time was so bad . small crab over priced at $75 for less than 500g i would say ....and sauce was sickly sweet not chilli as usual.... beer was warm and $12 for small plate of greens was truly the end of a bad mealwill never go back or recommend ...they are chasing the dollars and pushing dishes and not worth it - went to long beach next door to make up for bad meal and was so impressed by the sweetness and quality of crab was cheaper and way way better ... don't make same mistak
3
This high traffic jumbo seafood restuarent near riverside is amazing place..It runs 2 shifts for dinner from 6-8pm and 8-10pm. Ad hoc visit without rsvp us bad cos you really got to wait for min 1hr.. above model is for aircon inside the restaurent..They have alfresco as well and more cater to last minutw diners..Food is good but overly price.. do come with a fat wallet.Checks the photos out.
5
booking from the website with excellent experience; the most impressive thing is the excellent food！
5
It tastes very good and the service is satisfied.We booked it earlier before 2 days and luckily it works.
3
Chili Crab had a very strong taste and it was a little hot!
And...actually I was a little warm.
Service is good!
3
there were too many mosquito around the dinning table, and it was hard to get waiter attention. i have no idea why they arranged another customer seat just next to us, even there were many empty tables.!!!
3
Chilli crab was good. But staff could be more polite and friendly. Staff doesnt smile at all. I mean the manager/supervisor. Time given to eat too little. Stress the guest into eating faster
4
Good food but always seems to rush the customers by giving time grace at the counter. This has resulted in great discount on overall experience
5
The food is really delicious as always. The ambience is also very nice. Will definitely visit there again,
5
After arrangements with friends fell through, we decided to dine here regardless. And I'm glad we did!The restaurant was busy, and being just two, we shared a large table with two other groups. With only the two of us, we ended up with Drunken Prawns, Sambal Kangkong and the Chilli Crab. The prawns was cooked well and were succulent with a nice broth. The vegetable was also good. The star, the Singapore Chilli Crab, was some of the freshest crab I've had recently, the flesh firm and sweet, with the not too spicy sauce enhancing the flavor rather than overpowering it.Service was good and prompt, although I gather there was some misunderstanding when an adjacent group was placing her order

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on our experience at Jumbo Seafood Gallery.10 years ago we lived along the river in Singapore. Jumbo was a regular spot for us to dine out alsmost every week.4 years ago on a visit to Singapore we could not get in without a reservation. This week on a visit to Singapore we made a reservation in advance to ensure we could repeat our 10 year old experience and celebrate my wife's birthday. We were greatly dissappointed.We were greeted not by "Welcome" but by "you have to finish by such time because we have other customer after you."We were seated shoulder to shoulder and elbow to elbow with the next table. It nade it difficult to eat without touching the person next to usit was very difficult to get the attention of the servers. And the attitude of the servers was clearly that they wanted to see us go as soon as possible.Our 3 dish meal was served at staggered times with the main dish coming long after the side dishesJumbo is now at the top of our list of places to never go again

We are a group of foodies and on a recommendation of a friend we dined at Jumbo's. We had chili crab, pepper crab, cheese prawns, Chinese spinach with dried scallops and seafood fried rice. Every single bite was fantastic! You can even buy the chili sauce to take home. Dine outside for a nice view. Reservation is a must
5
The seafood is quite fresh, always chili&black pepper crabs. Mocha ribs also highly recommend! You can enjoy delicious food and good service beside the river. But you need to book earlier.
5
Time of dinner is very hurry. It's so less time to enjoy the meals. The food is fresh and delicious. It worth to have a try. I will be back next time
5
An excellent place to visit. The chilli crabs lived up to the expectations. Our waiter, Gerard Ooi, helped us through the experience and gave us useful tips.
5
Will recommend to my friends and family. We went early two a half hours before our reservations we will able to get our table. Good and efficient
5
Tasting crab was why I chose this restaurant. Spicy crab tastes as good as what I have heard. I will definitely recommend JUMBO to my friends.
5
Food was delicious, service was good, surrounding was also good, just it'd have been better if the serving speed could be a little bit quicker.
5
delicious and fresh seafood with excellent cooking skill,wonderful service!thanks for the birthday coupon;)
4
nice and very good feeling, crab price expensive a lot than i visited last time. but still must try if visit singapore
4
Have tried Jumbo few times before. Very good place for a nice crab dinner.
Very important to make reservation before.Its crowded even on weekdays
5
This location is situated right on the water. It has a beautiful view but we opted to sit inside since it was a particularly humid evening and wanted to have air conditioning. They had menu consisting of a couple of their most popular dishes made for 2 people which worked out for us which allowed us to try a bit of a variety of dishes without ordering full entrees which we could not have finished. Started with duck and mango slaw salad. Light and refreshing which was perfect for such a humid evening. There were some other vegetables and side dishes but the highlight was the Singaporean chili crab and fried dough. The dough was perfect for dipping in the chili sauce. Crab was fresh and succulent. It's messy but interactive and worth the effort of cracking crab and picking out the meat. Would definitely go to this place again just for the crab the next time I'm in the country.
3
I forgot to use my membership when I check out. But they agreed to cancel my paid bill and give me discount using my membership.
The food is delicious as always. But the price is also still scaring...
2
Worst service I've had in any restaurant in Singapore. Was embarrassed as was hosting a senior colleague.
4
you should try chili crab & black pepper crab. Its very delicious. A crab weighing 1 kg and price is $ 78.8/kg not included taxes. I didnt know they added too much taxes 17%??
1
the clerks are all impolite and somewhat rude, i wonder how this restaurant could be so famous. Food is also nothing special taste
5
Chilli Crab was very delicious!!!!!
Thank you.
Chilli Crabは、旅行中に食べてみたい料理の1つでした。
人気店との情報から、このサイトで日本から事前に予約して行きました。
行列ができていましたが、私達はスムーズに入店できました。
Chilli Crabも揚げパンも、とっても美味しかったです。
日本にもこの店舗がOPENしてほしいです。
私達は英語が不得手ですが、チャレンジして良かったです。
メニューに日本語が併記されており、写真も沢山載っているので、身振り手振りでも通じました。
食べ方も同様で、ウェイターさんも気を配ってくださり、とても素敵なランチタイムを過ごせました。
4
It was the best dining during my travel in Singapore. I'd recommend the fried rice and chili crab. However, service was soso.
5
Love the online reservasion, very convenient. Nice service, great big amount of food!
Will definitely come back!
5
JUMBO seafood is very delicious, go to Singapore's friends must not be missed!Crab component is very sufficient, we eat very satisfied!
3
Food: ordered chili crab, sotong donut, bean curb, drunken shrimp, baby kallang. Can imagine the original taste should be good but the food when serviced cool down and become lukewarm and affect the taste. Usually Chinese dishes needed to be served hot.Service: not as good as several months ago. E.g. plates with crab shelves removed without replacing a new ones. Waiter looked impatient for orders while you are still checking with others to pick your orders. In the past, the waiter will proactively give advices and recommendations to speed up the ordering process
5
Jumbo does not fail to satisfy our craving for freshest and best chilli crab. The reservation via chope was also a breeze and fuss-free. The service was attentive and very standard. There is also wifi connection though it does not work when i tried it. It is not a big issue though as i can use my mobile data instead
3
Service is very superficial，For the questions we ask are not answered, or we do not understand the language to answer the question, the feeling is very bad! Next time I won't visit you again.
4
All dishes were delicious, eapecially the crab and fried rice. But the service didn't worth 10% of the bill.
4
Overall food is good and seafood are really fresh due to its popularity but I find the price a little to high.
5
The wait wasn't bad on a week night, and their reservation system onsite is good. And so worth it! We had noodles, a shrimp and egg dish and the piece de resistance, chill crab. Succulent, messy, and so wonderful...a great place to go and share.
3
Tried the chilli crab together with some fried buns. The sauce was amazing with the buns. However, it was a bit expensive (78 SGD/kg). Meal sets were offered at a relatively cheaper price, and it seemed that a 2-people set was enough for 3 people.
4
the food is good,I like the fish, but the time for dinner is only 1.5h quite short , the crab is also good.
4
Foods were excellent.
Services were good.
But atmosphre was bad.
Noisy, crowded and what was worse our seat was next to the toilet.
3
Due to the high turnover, the restaurant was anxious to clear the queue. Although we hada party of 8, we were still given a 2 hour period to eat up and pay up. Service was obviously rushed. What we didn't like was how they pushed Chinese Tea on us. Although half the table ordered other drinks, the moment they poured for the remaining four (without being ordered by the way), they charged tea for everyone at the table.
5
Its like dining with he soup nazi... you do what they say to get that chilli crab. Totally awesome in all respects. make sure and order the buns to go with your crab. Not cheap at over $100 for lunch but i would go back once a week for the rest of my life if i could!They have a line for walk-ins but best to book if your not Chinese i think
4
A Friend recommended this place for Crab and now every time i visit Singapore, I make it a habit to eat at this place. I found their Chilli Crab (an award winning) and Black Pepper Crab amazing. The restaurant is crowded and the tables are cramped, so book in advance.I always ask for the river side view and found the closed part of the restaurant to be a bit noisy
4
Obviously, the Jumbo is a good restaurant which the food there is delicious. However the environment there is kind of noisy and customers cannot enjoy the meal very well...
5
Very Good!! good service good value good food good atmosphere thank you so much very good time good dinner
3
This seafood restaurant is really nothing special; food is not bad but at the same time nothing special.. service is really not good, waiters are pretty rude, slow as hell and they make confusion with the orders!
I suggest you to try another one.
5
We went to the restaurant last Saturday and everything was just wonderful. We will go there again soon.
4
good service along singapore river.big portions when ordering small.good to share.crowded at times as fresh seafood.
5
Reservations are required
If you go diredly without the required reserve to bring sell phones.
Long wait
4
Our spot for Chili Crab whenever in SG. Sure there are other place around like No Signboard but at No signboard, it seems they are trying to rip off tourists by offering them the more expensive crab varieties claiming the standard Sri Lankan is out of stock. At Jumbo, no such things happen. Just an honest, good and meaty crab for Chili Crab. You can also order Cereal Prawns de-shelled which we prefer. The only downside was, if you wanted to eat in the air conditioned section, you will have to share a big round table with other people.
4
This is a place not to miss while in Singapore. The food stalls give you an amazing selection of a variety of local food. Walk around, check out what you want, mix and match from several food stands, and sit at one of the plastic tables to enjoy your meal. Don't expect anything fancy, just delicious food, service in a very utilitarian setting and unbelievably low prices
3
Good seafood, not to go crazy with though, but very expensive. Too expensive considering overall quality. They serve you tea and peanuts as welcome and then they charge you them in the bill and menu prices do not include 17% tax which will be added to your already expensive bill.Worth to eat there only if you want to try the crab with singapore receipt and sit outside to enjoy river view but be ready to pay this more than expected
4
Very fun restaurant. My husband enjoyed watching the lobster crawl into other fish's tanks while we waited for food. We had the Singapore must-do: Chili Crab. A great experience! We were not very good at eating crab with chopsticks but we will practice and come again. The only con was that the service staff seemed a little confused. We didn't get the drinks we ordered and napkins were not delivered to our table until we asked three times. Also beware its market pricing for about half the menu so you may be surprised when check arrives. Our "light lunch" was well over $100, we shared an entree and didn't have alcohol.
4
Third time enjoying Jumbo's chili crab and it has been consistently delicious -- which is very important when you're hosting visitors from overseas.
5
The chilicrab and other food in Jumbo seafood is one of the best food in singapore.
If I visit the Singapore, I have to vist here again.
2
Tastes are quite nice, cause theres nothing to eat in Singapore! And they are extremely expensive and hard and uncomfortable to eat....
4
Good food and good location. I will always recommend my oversea friend to come to Jumbo Seafood restaurant.
5
the pepper crab was excellent and the shrimp fried noodles also tasty!!! No need arrive there earlier than your booking time as the restaurant was too full and you must still waiting even you have reservation.
1
Service to customers was a terrible,
Given time is only 1 hour and 15 minutes but after ordering food 30 minutes over watering food.
absolutely do not want to recommend. if you wnat relax meals with your family.
3
Their menu is similar to other of their branches... Way of cooking is also similar and nice... One thing I prefer their main branch at UDMC centre is that they have larger Sri Lanka crabs of 2kg and above as compare to this branch. Still recommended for their tasty seafood !! Come !
4
We had a delicious dinner here with business colleagues. The place is very busy and full of families enjoying a night out. Try the chilly crab or salt and pepper crab and pick some side dishes as well. First time for everything - did enjoy this and will be going back. Friends suggest the Jumbo on the East Coast if you want something out of town!
3
The food was great, especially the chilli crab and cereal prawn.However, the service was a bit lackluster given how expensive the restaurant is.We already had an odd booking time of 1.45pm, and as soon as we arrived, the staff were rushing us to order because their kitchen was closing before we were even fully settled in.In the middle of eating our chilli crab, this waiter came over with the bill and asked us to settle it first as the restaurant was preparing to close. Given how messy eating the chilli crab with your hands are, my boyfriend continued to finish his piece of crab first. Then the waiter was really mean and asked us a rather rude manner to pay first despite how dirty our hands were to even reach into our bags for our wallets.What was even more odd is a really big group of over ten people came in even later than us but they were greeted super friendly and were not rushed to pay in the middle of eating. The only thing that makes me think the service provided would differ was for the sheer fact that the staff provided better service to groups as they order more food and had a bigger bill obviously.
4
It's a good location, just near the MRT,walk for three minutes can be arrived.A lot of customers outside the shop, a little messy,recommend for booking earlier.The food is fresh and delicious, but time is a bit tight.I'll looking forward to the next visit
4
the atmersphere is not so good. a little crowded, noisy and cold. the food is not delicate, but delicious.
1
we received terrible service from waiters. They did not respond to our order and acted as if we were not customers. they were irritable.
4
A good place to hangout for 6-8 pax team building dinner. Response from the service team can be further improved though.
2
Staff were not kind and they just were so busy and rush us to order. Also, I don't understand why they treat poor on bring some napkins.
4
We had the signature chili crabs along with some other dishes. Quality of the food was there as usual. However, we were only given around 1.5 hours to finish our food, reason being that they tried to maximize the table seating due to high popularity.
5
The crab and prawn is fresh and delicious.
The staff is quite busy and provide good service.
And reasonable price.
SGD 500 for 6 adults and 3 kids.
A bit crowd for the seat as too many customers.
Will go back again.
1
The Services provided by the normal staff is way much better than the Manager. The managers shows us his frustration when we asked for the menu to order extra food. We were given a reply "There is no everything" when we want to tryout and order all the dessert in the menu. Not worth paying so much and receiving such service especially from the restaurant manager. Will not visit that branch again to receive this kind of humiliation from the branch manager himself
4
The black pepper crab was a bit spicy but the texture of the crab meat was so fresh and yummy. Love it! The seafood fried rice was also very well-prepared. We could only get a table in the open area and it can be a bit hot, but the food was really great
1
The food was very delicious and my family and I really enjoyed it. However, as we came out of the restaurant, we all said to each other that we should never come back to this place due to terrible services. This restaurant is really famous and popular so I guess just my family not going to this restaurant won't be a big deal to them. Still, I have to say that the waiter receiving our orders was extremely rude and unkind when I asked about the food and seemed to be annoyed that we could only speak English. Also, when we were about to pay, another waiter with disgust in her face told us bluntly that we should pay at the table. However, I saw her being extremely nice to those who spoke Chinese. Is not being able to speak Chinese because we are not from Singapore or China that big of a deal? Is it that big fault of mine
4
it was great time in there. but i think there is not enough place to wait. there were a lot of people who wait their turn.but most people stood around there with out chairs.execpt for that point, i really like most of thing.i got my dishs very fast, and i entered there early than i reserved. actually, i took an antihistaminic to eat seafood and i think it was worth it. thanks for giving me a great memory in Singapore
5
Jumbo Chilli Crab...A must try! Not just once but every single trip to Singapore. Everything else can wait.
4
I have a dinner at Jumbo. It's famous in the chili crab and cereal prawn. The food is very fresh and great
3
We had booked dinner in advance.(recommend to make a reservation)
We ordered the chilli crab,mini bun deep fried and prawn-meat with cereal.The crab and cereal prawns were great but quite expensive.
4
Food 'Chilli Crab' so nice
Fried Bun with Chilli Crab Source very delicious
Drink Lychee Soda do'nt miss to try
Service so good
5
Atmosphere and good food was delicious
Location was also good places to find
I have a reservation for lunch it was quiet good
5
The restaurant is one of the best in singapore for sea food...
All the food specially spicy crab was delicious...
I would like to visit again.
2
too many sessions and chasing guests to eat quickly and leave.Too many sessions .Should allow guests to enjoy the food
2
My english is unskillful. So the staff is unkidness. My girlfriend feel so bad. I'm also not good. Be a little more development. Thanks
5
The atmosphere is good, service is good, food is delicious, the only one shortcoming is that the price is a little bit expensive
1
The waitress kept on chasing and rushing my friends and myself to finish all dishes though we couldn't!! Terrible experiences in eating foods in such a rushing time where we were feeling like being forced to SWALLOW the foods but not eating the foods!!!! Paid money to get this kind of punishments??? How fool am I?
5
The food is delicious, the price is reasonable！Serving soon！But sitting outside a little hot！Next time will also go to eat！
3
crab tasted extreme good but weather too hot in July, hopefully to have air conditioning in summer time.
4
A little bit expensive but worthwhile. So many people came to the restaurant. Have a reservation before hand prior to the visit date.
2
The service was terrible. Not sure why many of the service staff seemed frustrated and impatient. Food is not too bad but the price is expensive.
If service can be greatly improved, it would be a great dining experience.
5
The marinate of the crab was really good. Worth of price!
We ordered fried rice and enjoyed with the crab and it was really nice combi!
5
there is good chilli crap, mini bun, fried rice.
this is very impressive experience for me.
thank you for your kindness.
5
Food is very fresh，Service attitude is very good，The environment is very good！！！！I like that place！！
4
The crab is very soft and thin, service is also general. But the prawn is very nice. So I feel JUMBO is more like a scenic spot.
3
Jumbo's was recommended as the best restaurant for famous Singapore chilli crab. We had chilli prawns and cereal prawns form starters. Dried chilli prawns were excellent. We shared a 900gm chilli crab which was the best we've tasted. The food was overall excellent. Thats where the positive experience stopped. Jumbo's is not the place to go for a relaxed, service friendly or inexpensive dining experience. We were rushed from the time we were seated and told we had a mximum of 75 minutes to have our meals and pay. Nice way to start? The two starters were staggered in being brought to us - with 2 of dining was kind of awkward with the 2nd stater coming with the chilli crab. Waiter also took the 1st starter from our table before we had finished. In the rush our asking for this to be returned was lost. The drinks waiter who was dressed in Tiger beer uniform got insulted and would not serve me when I asked of a Heineken (which was on the drinks list). Only consider Jumbo's for the food experience. If you are expecting a relaxed and enjoyable customer friendly dining experience, you are in the wrong place. Jumbos from our observations appears to be a restaurant franchise focussed on table turns and churn of paying customers to keep the cash register turning over. Overall disappointing
2
Taste of chili crab is fine (the chili sauce, not the crab). The crab is not fresh. One crab claw has ammonia smell and taste. Very bad. And the crab itself is tasteless. Service is not good and crowded. Wait 45 minutes for a dish of vegetable (maybe we do not order set). If you are looking for good food, don't go here
4
Little bit of a wait for our reserved table but food was good and service was speedy. Have used other branches before but this one at Riverwalk did not disappoint.
1
We didn't served water for washing fingers and tools for cracking crab.
but the other tables served properly
It might be that we were tourists. she never did to Singaporeans.
I never recommand to my friends Jumbo Gallery.
It was terrible experience.
5
The spicy crab is my favorite, better than any other restaurant in Singapore
nice sea view , friendly staff
4
We always bring our visiting guests here to try the infamous chili crab and no one has yet complained. The food is always good and as expected
1
Dirty, and not as good as compared to prices. Hair on a plate.....
Service is too bad.
Must also more variable
3
The food was very average. Service was below par as we had to wait for a very long time any time we wanted service. The crab was the only good dish out of the whole night.
5
The pepper carb, fried prawn with cereal are delicious!! And the restaurant is located in the centre of the Sungapore, you can visit the Merlion after the meal in 15minutes on foot.
5
my guest had a great time and they enjoyed the food a lot. They mention that they will be back again.
1
First of all, reaching Singapore I had booked this before dinner. And book two places. Arrived and was told only two and seat with no air conditioning on the periphery. In 30 degree weather was very bad. Second makes me angry is that bad attitude of service personnel. I don't understand I made a service charge and why after taxes for such services. Sitting in the open for dinner, and suddenly it began to rain, the waiter delays to pack my food after I paid for it. Let them get in the rain, it makes me very angry. I am very disappointed in JUMBO, will never come again, and my friends say don't. That's too ba
5
I've tried Jumbo in Dempsey and Riverside, but this Riverwalk Jumbo is so far my favorite. Short walk out of Clarke Quay MRT station across a cute pedestrian tunnel.No doubt about its Chilli Crab as other Jumbos..tasty, spicy, huge crab.Lunchtime is not the best time here as it is too hot. Dinner with outside seating is the best, with all the colorful lamps and river traffic view
3
The outlet at circular road was terrible...I can't feel the aircon so does my mom. So the food is serve hot and the seating was really terrible. Sweating for the whole entire session. Overall the food is really good.
3
Staff unfriendly and do not speak well for customer interaction.
These parts are required for improvement.
4
The restaurant was crowded yet our food was served in a timely manner. The chilli crab was good and the gravy was excellent.
The service was excellent as our plates were changed at regular intervals.
5
strongly recommend, tasty food, nice service, good location......Everything is fantastic. But suggest book it days advance.
4
a full delicious crabs with exotic sauce,cost performance highly appreciated,atmosphere is so nostalgic fulled with SIN river. So good ! So fabulous !
3
Order a set for four persons,cost 350 include tax and service fee.the environment is not good,cost expensive and taste not good.
4
Chilli crab flavor is very good, but the serving speed too slow. We were arrived at 17:30pm according to booking time, however it was served the dishes until to 19:00pm. it would considered to continuing improvement.
5
Brought my Indonesian friends for a dinner. All of us enjoyed the food till forgot to take pictures!!
4
Touristy as it may be, chili crab experience in Singapore is a must-try! I was able to snag a reservation two days before. Unfortunately they only had outdoor tables available for our reservation and it was hot & stuffy. Nonetheless, we ordered a chili crab with fried buns, sauteed water spinach and tiger beer. Service was very slow, so don't expect to go somewhere soon. The crab was excellent. I almost wish they offered noodles to add to the sauce because it was really good! Slight kick but not too spicy. Server said the black pepper version is actually the spicier of the two popular flavors, but since we only had a party of 2, I didn't think we could finish 2 crabs! It's slightly pricey but the crab is huge and filling, so I thought it was actually reasonable
5
We live in Singapore and frequent this place whenever guests are in town! Amazing chilli crab every time, cant go wrong. Just don;t forget to book (you can book online) or you might be disappointed, even on a weeknight it can be tough to get a tabl
4
Chilli crab was tasted good.
But there was very crowded so it was noisy.
And employees were very busy.
2
Jumbo Restaurant is very crowded. With tourist. And the food now taste like Tour Bus food.
Of course, their signature dish (Chilly Crab) is still good and expensive, but the other selections are below par of any good class restaurant.
2
And the clerks need to speak
up their voice. It was hard to understand their speaking in such a crowded place..
3
Tried chili crab among other things and i really dont know what all the hype is about. It's decent but not something I would recommend to all my friends and family.
4
Ourdoor seating it's a bit hot ! Overall experience is very good ! It's a bit expensive ! Service is very good as well!
5
I enjoyed that jumbo seafood.
Food is very delicious.
Happy time.
I remember that jumbo seafood.
Good luck to you.
Thank you.
5
It is a nice place to eat with family or friends. It is better to book online, otherwise you have to wait for a long time as it is very popular restaurant.
5
I have been to one of their other chains before.Myself and my partner ordered the Chilli Crab and it did not disappoint. Yes it is expensive but it is worth it. I like the bibs they give you and the place is always packed. We struggled to get a reservation so book well in advance. However they do have a ticketed queuing system if you do not have a reservation
1
We had a reservation at 5.30pm and reached 5.10pm so we have to wait till 5.30pm before they start seating guest. Once seated they told us that dinner time till 6.45pm. I was ready to order but have to wait approx 20mins before they are ready to help us order. I was looking to eat the sri lanka crab but the waitress keep emphasizing on the Canadian crab as it will take faster for them to cook. I insist on Sri Lanka crab and she says it will take more than half hour for the crab to arrive. I asked if they cook slow, we would have to leave at 6.45? leaving us 20mins to eat the crab or so? Yes was the reply i got. The food and the crab arrive very fast. therefore I'm not sure if she is trying to sell me the canadian crab instead. Total food ordered: Chilli Crab (taste normal like what u can find in tze char store) $78 per kg, their speciality chicken which was bland and not chicken. Its like chicken skin with seafood paste, stir fried venison, herbal live prawn 300gm, spinach tofu, mee goreng & fried rice. Total bill for 4 pax at $240. Expensive and the taste of food standard can be found anywhere
5
Visited the restaurant with my parents and all of us are really satisfied with the food. We ordered chilli crab, cereal prawn, vension, seafood fried rice and mantou. All are very good. Though it is a bit expensive, it is still worth trying! There is another Jumbo in the Clarke Quay. The one I visited is Jumbo Seafood Gallery. However, I think the location of another one (Jumbo Seafood Riverwalk) is more convenient and has better view. Go and try if you visit Singapore
5
Delicious chill crab! The set menu gave you a taste of a few dishes. Wasn't cheap though. $207 for 2 people. But is was worth it.
3
they didn't notice us the tea charge fee and they didn't offer us anymore tea after the first cup which make us feel unpleasant
5
Front:they can managing the queue very well.
Staff:take care so good and fast as professional.
Food:they can serves so fast and the taste is very very good
re commented for family because food comes in a big size
4
Food is nice but service is ok.
Without a smile service.
But the place is quite nice and convient...
3
we ordered 2 types of crab. The chilli crab was great. But the pepper crab was disappointment. The pepper paste was not using punchy flavour. It was a dull grey color, not the usual black. Also, the pepper crab was aged.... meat was powdery.
4
The restaurant is so popular and you will only have 1h30m to finish your dinner. Chili crab is the best
4
Great place, i suggest requesting a seat indoors so that you are not sweating in the Singapore heat. Lovely chilli crab
4
The chilli crab is so yummy. I also like the shrimp with cheese which is suitable for children. The price is quite expensive.
4
Had a dinner with friend visiting from Australia. Ordered Chili Crab (1Kg), fried baby squids, razar clams (1 each), Spinach in 3 eggs, Fried dough sticks with fish paste and Mee Goreng. Food came very fast (within 15 minutes of ordering). Flavours were consistent with past visits and we have no complaints, other than that the food was served faster than expected. I also commend the drinks auntie in the area who ensured that our tea cups were also filled with warm tea, and also changed out the plates whenever they were full of shells
3
No reservation, you sign and they call you when it's ready. You've got 1 hour 15 mn to eat, although when we complained they said they'd try to give us more time! We had the fried rice and baby calamari ( hard and not so tasty) the crab was large and took some time to cook but it was delicious... We finished just in time although the manager came to our table to explain that the crab was large and needed time to cook and we had more time to eat. What i did not like: no napkin, only one set of crab craker!!Nice place though!!
5
We like the food very much!!! We will visit again with our friend, and I will tell my friends they should come
4
Love the crab meat though the shell is very hard. Many waiters to meet crowd demands but the rice still came only after the third dish has been served.
Will still be back as it's worth it as a member.
3
Everything were good but dishes were not cleaned enough. So staff cleaned up infront of us at the table.
4
More comfortable sitting than hawker style dining, food is consistent and good. Price is a bit higher.
3
The food was expensive, it was the most expensive food i had in Singapore.
The taste was fair, no river view if sitting in a place with air-con.
5
Just felt the crab became smaller ,hahah, mayb it's not the right season ? And some of the service staff are not very professional .
4
food are good,I make appointment, but as lost road, need to find where is Riverwalk JUMBO, finally late.arrived and customers are lining up.that's mine.when reception meet me, she said you are late, we will cancel the booking automatically if later over 15 minutes.I asking what time is it and she said you are just late 16 minutes.you need to sit down over there and need to wait to rearranging the seats.this makes me sick.you are lining up and you told me you just late 1 minute so the computer system cancel the booking. how can I say??2 Jumbo restaurants are so closed, and no clear map to show where is it.just walk from the MRT, how can you suppose a tourist know how to get it there easily?and you have so many customers to line up, you sitting arrangement is so slow, how can you cancel the booking so fast and mentioned you are late?even the system problem, the reception attitude should be better and not in black face and said you need to wait to rearrange and line up with other walk in customers
4
As title, the Chili Crab is very good even I don't like eating crab. But the service was not as good as the food, might be the tradition of some big long history restaurant around world that waiters/waitresses are too tired of serving all the needs of clients
2
If you would like to be served with no smile and pay triple that you would pay in all civilized country, then through away your money on this restaurant. I almost was wondering if it is not customary to smile maybe...but after being served in other places by very friendly crew, I realize that it is just these restaurant (chain) that rip tourists off for trying as they claim local specialty.. 2 stars for a view only

Food is a bit disappinted.. the chilli crab do not cleaned well.. the drunken prawns is tastless & shd not ask us to finish the food in certain time.. although they did not say is a must but by telling people is a minus in the service.Only a good thing to compliment back about is the mgr give a bit discount although i forgot to renew my card

The chilli crab, salted egg prawns and the bamboo clams are must have :p The table was ready for us when we arrived and serving of the food was quick (under 10 mins).

What drew us to this restaurant was the the fact that it was jam-packed full of people and had a large queue waiting ! ( always a good sign that the food is great ! ) We had initially tried to get into its sister establishment further along the Riverwalk, but as i was queuing there the very helpful waitress told us this branch only had a 20 min wait. They also made my booking online for me and told me I would be contacted on my mobile phone ( what a great use of technology! ) So after a walk back along the river we only had a short time to wait before our number came up ( they only hold your table for 5 min before giving it away ) The helpful staff were very good - for example informing us that small portions would be sufficient for us - and they were ! The food was delicious and very fresh. My salted egg prawns were amazing. Obviously it is very informal and the tables are crushed together and it may not suit everyone. It is also quite expensive but we really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend i

Really good clean chilli crab and black pepper crab.Throw a jug of tiger beer on the tab and it's a great night.Be aware that there are two locations along the river. This location is smaller and less public but there is no real view

I was there for my birthday dinner but the occasion was ruined by bad service and mediocre food at a high price. First, there was this waitress who seemed as if she was unwilling to get our order. Then at the end of the meal, another waitress shoved my umbrella onto the floor. Not only did she not pick it up right away, she continued getting beer out of a fridge next to my seat for a good couple of minutes. Even when a waiter nearby tried to alert her to what happened, she shouted: "Wait!", in a gruff manner. Only after a while did she pick up my umbrella without any apology. Everyone got her bad days, I thought. But when I complained to the management, somone called me on the mobile not to apologize but to give excuses for her behavior, saying that another waiter misplaced some of the stuff and it resulted in her being in a foul mood. Point taken: Jumbo management condones bad service when their staff is not in a good mood.

We love the chili crab, the cereal prawns, the seafood fried rice.... All are top quality. Service is very good too!I only have one issue. While making the reservation, there was a reminder that there will be 6pm seating and 8pm seating. So I thought we would have about two hours to eat, no problem!But my 5:30pm reservation was given confirmation with a note that we have till 6:45pm to finish our meal. And we were reminded about the time limit when we arrived at the restaurant.Please believe me, one hour and 15 minutes is way too rush to enjoy all the great seafood we ordered. Next time, I will not take a reservation with such short time limit
4
Was late on my reservation, but still got good services and a table..we ordered of course chilli crab and the bun, fried prawn cereal and homemade tofu, the food is good, the chilli crab tasted fantastic, love the sauce and we got 1.2kg crab, the service was excellence and we will come again, worth the pric
3
Food is very good in no doubt especially the well know black pepper crab; however service is really poor. Waitress was pushing us to order and impatience to reply you the charge of the seasonal crab price though we admitted what the price was told but no sincere service at all. We have only an hour dining time as requested but the crab was ready on the table in last 20 minutes though we chased our order several times. Imagine how rush we were in last 20 minutes..
4
I went there for reunion my freinds and his family. Actually it was nice food and place. However, some staff make us depress, it was a bit bad memory.
3
You arrive at 6pm with a party of 6 and are told that you have to give up your table by 730. Total rush job and yet service was slow and not attentive.
4
taste of chili crab and oat meal shrimp was marvelous. and i'd like to visit again and definitely recommend my friends.
3
The price for food is very high, but the taste is not of equal enjoyment. I'm sorry to say that I left the restaurant hungry with a bill of 500 singapore dollars.
4
Chili crab is awesome, however the mantou feels like it is getting smaller and smaller~ Best to reserve a place at least a week before actual date because the place is always full house.
4
Good food, Bad price
but good restaurant
chillicrab, fried prawn with cereal are best food. Good choice!
5
Everything is OK
I'm so happy to your survices :)
If i have a chance, visit singapore
Im sure visit jumbo restaurant again
1
seafood was made out of bad quality ingredients. Even a neighbourhood stall can cook better. Overpriced and total tourist trap!
2
Restricted time for dinner, indicated that must finish within one and half hour.
Food served was too fast
2
Heard good reports about this place so decided to give it a try. Menu looked good and we decided to go for the set menu B. The starter was a lobster and fruit course and to be honest if a lobster even looked at the dish I would have been amazed. We asked to see the manager and he didn't seem too bothered at all. He did say he would offer us a 10% discount but on a bill of 190 dollars seemed pretty poor. We didn't actually want a discount, we wanted to taste some lobster but unfortunately the manger did not seem too bothered at all. Would we go again - no- because of the lack of interest in our disappointment. We are not people who complain really and we do travel quite extensively, but this left us bitterly disappointed and we certainly would not recommend anyone to try it on our experience. Sorry to be so negative but when you are expecting a delightful meal and you get something quite mundane for that price, it just doesn't seem right.
5
Good cuisine,everyday is crowded. Delicious scallops, crab and fish, but not cheap. Poor wine-list. Casual atmosphere.
5
Chilli Crab should be ordered! Very tasteful! We also tried shrimp.And I like the coconut, my husband ordered 2 glasses of lemon tea.
4
Good location with river view. Their service is excellent. It was raining during the middle of meal, their staff responsed promptly (help us to move to another table). Highly recommand chilli crab and cereal prawn.Best crab I've had!!!
4
Wonderful Taste, good food, lovely service. We loved it. Its crowed every night, and we try to return, but could not. Service was nice here, that is unexpected.
3
The food is good.
The waiter is also good.
But the reception is not so warm as expected.
The limitation of dinner time is also horrible.
5
The food is good but the price is expensive. The indoor seat is better than outdoor. I'll visit it again.
4
The view and good along the river. Chilli crab is the best so far as compared to many other restaurants. But, price too premium.....
3
Good to have a reservation there as the queue is really long. Chili crab was too spicy and hot for me and all that hassle to open up the shells made me feel puzzled actually. The gloves they provide for the crab shall be vinyl, not plastic, as the plastic ones are way too big and its not comfortable to dine with them on. The chinese noodles were much better than the whole crab experience. Table was so dirty after I finished my crab and no one came to clean it! Duck salad was great. Overall - not so bad but def not for the crab experience

Went to JUMBO Seafood Gallery over the weekend for early LNY reunion dinner. Made a reservation beforehand and was promptly allocated a table. However, waited for quite a while and didn't seem to see the dishes being served to our table. Checked with the staff and realized that they didn't make the order for us with the kitchen?! the reason they given was that ours was pre-booked in advance so they missed it out. If we didn't ask, we would still be sitting there waiting. Was a bit pissed off by the service.Fortunately, after realizing, they went on to put our order on priority. The food standard sort of compensate the unhappiness that we encountered earlier on. Understand that this period is rather busy for the restaurant but hope that they can also upkeep the service & coordination
4
Good quality of Chilli crabs, not so spicy compared to traditional local ones. The location is by Clark Quay, amazing!!! Really enjoyed seafoods here and afterwards can walk along the river to bar area. Better just order Chilli crabs and shrimps. Of course they have coconut juice!
5
I can't describe by word because it is excellent，the taste of food、service、atmosphere and so on.All I can say is unbelievable
5
The place have nice view and the food is delicious and it's reasonable with the price. About the staff, they have good service.
2
Dishes were nice. Actually they were over my expectation. However, service was really disappointing. Food came out too slowly and service was bad since waiters often ignored my calling. Also they even tried to re-set a table before my family and I leave!
4
chose a different location this time. but the food was still wonderful. the chilli crab and black pepper crab is unrivalled. order the buns along with the crab dishes to mop up the gravy that's left over....
3
The chili crab was undoubtedly good, but it was not "the best in town" or otherwise outstanding.
The service staff was poor and did not speak english very well.
4
We ordered chilly crab, tofu and cereal shrimp. All were good and the quantity was just right for two people (not less). Service was good. Booking system is convenient.
4
After a cruise on the river we headed to dinner at Jumbo Seafood in Clark Quay it was crowded so we headed to location 2 which had only a 45 minute wait for a table. As it worked out it was a much shorter wait and we were seated in about 30 minutes. The setting itself was nothing special and the service was ok nothing special either. The highlight, though, was the food which was really good but expensive for me. Overall a good meal and the chilli crab was worth it
5
We ordered a chilli crab and it was so so delicious!The restaurant was so popular and there was still queue outside on weekday at 9 pm. We sat down at about 7:45 pm and were asked to return the table at 9 pm. We fully understood the situation and the manager asked us to leave politely but it was really a bit rush for us to finish the dinner. The girl who served us tea and wet towels was very responsible and polite.
4
It's Delicious seafood, especaially ChiliCrab and prawns- deshelled /c cerealsBUT, Service is not good, cause so many guests and ordersI understand, but it should be better and better, I hopeAnyway, Taste is awesome!I hope that I enjoy this food again somedayThank you~!
4
This place is always packed!! If you are coming with a party of more than 2 pax, be sure to reserve your table at least 3 days in advance. Although they are famous for their chilli crab, it's the salted egg crab thats to die for. They are one of my favorite places to go for salted egg crab! Staff will provide aprons if you order the crabs so as not to get your clothes dirty. Go ahead to ask for extras as souvenirs if you like. Service is fairly good considered the crowd that they have to deal with. As they will like to increase their guests turn over rates, be prepared to be served real quickly just so that they can get you the bill.Other items worth ordering include the bamboo clams which are seasonal, you tiao with so tong, man tou, fish maw soup, chilli crab
5
The service is very good and the environment is clear and light. All the experience is great. I will suggest Jumbo Seafood rather than No Signboard Seafood.
4
It was a pleasant place to have seafood but too many people waiting in line and we had to finish our food in 1.25 hour. Pretty rush but overall experience is good.
5
The crab that day was superbly fresh and the chili crab was delicious. My guests and I were satisfied. Thank you.
5
It was good service all the way from reception to wait staff to the food that was presented. Well done!
4
fantastic food as always, still loving the chilli Crab. overall we had a great night and will definitely go back again
4
The food is good esp. the pumpkin prawns and chilli crab... worth the price...
The service is good as well...
5
Like the chilli crab most, the place is a little crowded but the service is good, the price is a little bit higher but I love the good taste
5
Located on Riverwalk near Clarke Quay MRT Station.We ate the set lunch meal, with four dishes, including a great chilli crab.The seafood fried rice, dessert and garlic kankong were all excellent and the cold lychee drink was tasty.Great food and good value for money.We will be back, next time in Singapore
2
Ate at Jumbo seafood and was very disappointed. Apart from the set menu couldn't find any prices on the menu and when asked the waiter he was really evasive and pushed us towards the set menu. They had already taken drinks orders as soon as we sat down so a real waste that the set menu included drinks! The food was disappointing to say the least. There was very little crab and the cereal prawns were drenched in what tasted like hobnob crumbs! The duck salad was however very tasty. It was an expensive meal yet we were in and out in less than 1 hour! Will not be going back next visit to Singapore
1
For the life of me, I could not get ANY of the waiters to pay any sort of attention to our table. I literally had to stand up and wave my arms to get any kind of attention, any time we wanted anything. This was not a one-time thing - it was repeated throughout our meal.It took 20 minutes for steamed rice to come, and 30 minutes for the fish. The fish was not very hot when it arrived, leading me to think that the waiters just left it sitting in the kitchen until I asked for it.The food was decent, but the entire experience was severely marred by the service. I had just been to Jumbo Seafood@Riverside Point and am so surprised by how different the restaurants are. DO NOT GO TO JUMBO SEAFOOD GALLERY. Jumbo Seafood@Riverside Point may have a waiting time, but it's better than going to a restaurant where you can't get any attention at all
2
My last dish was not delivered after 20 minutes.
I have called for the bill and walk out.
Even then there is not sign of food delivering.
4
We didn't wait for long for the food and taste was good! I made online reservation and service was good!
4
Food and service render was very good. But over the years that I've patronised the restaurant, the cost of food seems to be more costlier.
3
Crab food is delicious.
But it's too expensive .
And Service is normal.
I recommanded it to my friends , but they want cheaper restaurant.
5
The booking control was on time.
The food order was fast n correct but one of the orders did not come timely n had to intervene. Should double check if all good orders are delivered.

I am a very regular Jumbo customer because part of my job entails entertaining foreign business associates whom many are keen to try our famous Singaporean chilli crab. This Jumbo outlet is not even on my top 3 list (Riverside, Dempsey and East Coast) because my past experiences here have been average and the environment is particularly chaotic (not ideal for business entertaining). Nonetheless, this was the only option available that day and after this dinner, I will rather go to another seafood restaurant than to return to this outlet (if my top 3 are fully-booked). Our group of 7 was assigned a "private room" where another table of guests were seated. If you thought that meant more personalized service, we were so wrong. On the contrary, we had to get up constantly to stick our heads out the rooms in order to get service. Wine bottles were left on the service table without glasses and when they did arrive, no one bothered to pour. Self-service then. Food arrived and were left on service table, getting cold until we stood up to pick them up ourselves or if needing to be served, we stood up and walked out to ask them to serve. Ordering more drinks? Go out to order. Plates requires a change? Open the in-room service tables / cabinets and help yourselves to the clean plates. Find your own cutlery there too. While the food itself was not particularly bad, I have to highlight that the chilli crab was served without the usual generous amounts of gravy. This is quite a disappointment for my guests especially when they came especially for this. A shocking experience made worse by my complete embarrassment - I could only apologize to my high-level Japanese guests repeatedly for such service standards
4
I have booked since a month before, and they let me in 5 minutes before the booked time. The food was perfect. The only let down was the time it took for them to bring our rice. I don't understand why it took them almost 15 minutes to bring rice to our table. Overall, if you love crabs. It's recommended. A bit pricey, but recommended
5
I made a reservation a month ago and read many reviews.Some people didn't satisfied so i worried the taste and staff's service.But i and my mom had really good dinner and paid a reasonable price.We had a chili crab and fried rice. It was good for two ladies
2
The crabs are now SGD88++/kg. When I first started eating in Jumbo 7 years ago, it was below SGD50++/kg. I know there is inflation in Singapore, but I don't think prices of food in Singapore has doubled in the last 7 years. Worse, the crabs we had were below average - not meaty and not succulent. Even worse, the amount of MSG they put into the food had caused my wife to have an MSG attack that night which led to insomia. The spinach with century eggs dish was very starchy and very bad. That is not how it is done. Overall experience is very disappointing. I had expected better from Jumbo
2
Poor customer service experience. We wait very Long for the manager come to take our orders and he gave us the "wait or no"gesture as he is very busy tapping the tablet and after he done with his thing then he forgot to take our orders. And we have to call him again. Food are slow to come and tea is not hot. When we want more napkins had to ask twice from different waiter. No many guests on the day when we got in at 8pm plus. It's quite disappointed. Famous restaurant with good food but the service is bad.

A valued service by staff Adeline and team for 30 pax for 25th wedding anniversary dinner in a private room

when i go to SIngapore, I go to eat here, cuz i like eat chilli crab verymuch and service is good. and place is o.k near many good place
1
Super expensive but shiiiiit taste. They got money of tea and tissue. And chilly crab is too hard to eat p
4
Food and services are great and we do enjoy it a lot. Plus, the atmosphere is good
by the Singapore river. Will recommend friends to dine in there.

Attached in the reservation confirmation slip, there is a liner stating " Next Reservation might start at XXX time". Translated to: You must finished your meal by this time as the next table reservation is coming.not aware of that meaning till i was there. My ignorant , my bad.Due to the fact it was not i who wanted to eat there, i could not just walk away. Still spend over a hundred per pax for a rushed dinner. forget about the wine pairing recommendation by the servers, because there simply isn't enough time to enjoy it. And stating that you want an indoor seat in the Reservation list or probably any request is totally not necessary as the counter staff is not aware there was such a request made on the online form. The outsourced contractor (Chope) dont send those information to ground staff
3
We attend lunch and the place is not fancy, tea and peanuts are served without asking and then charged! No napkins available upon request, crab is good! rice good enough, beverages more less... I think you will expend the same amount in other restayrant with more ammenities
2
Bought my friends there as a treat for their birthdays and was really excited for it. However, the place disappoint with its cleaniness and lousy food. The crabs were small in size despite the server mentioning that its at least close to 1kg each. One of the staff scowled at a member of our group when we misinterpreted her questions
5
The chilli crab is enormous and fantastic, a bit expensive but so worth it. Yes these restaurants are touristy but with good reason - they deliver - and there were plenty of locals when we were there, all enjoying the great atmosphere next to the river. The service was very helpful; while they did pour tea and set out peanuts without explaining the nominal charge they gave great advice about portion sizes and ordering. Also, suggest you ring to book or else wait in a queue , even during the wee
5
We first went to Jumbo Seafood Riverside (opposite Clarke Quay), but the wait was 2 hours!!! So we decided to walk down to Jumbo Seafood Gallery (still right on the water). We waited 15mins. We went there specifically for the Chilli Crab ... we were not disappointment. YUM!!!!!! A bit messy and fiddly (but hey, that's what the bibs are for lol). We also ordered the Chinese buns to soak up all the chilli sauce after the crab was eaten. It's not cheap, but so worth it. I'd go back again and again
5
Food was delicious, restaurant was busy and considering how busy the device wasn't bad. Even on a Sunday I recommend you to book as it's super busy. We shares the chilli crab, pepper crab, some bread, rice and prawns. We were pretty full after one crab...but it tasted so nice...we kept going. You haven't been to Singapore if you haven't been to Jumbo
4
Went with my colleagues to let him have a taste of Singapore's food. This is the best place to go to with needed variety and one stop solution
4
Good food good crab crowded but ok service.
Must book in advance otherwise hard to get table in clarke quay branches
4
Huge place, great seating, amazing food taste. be slightly wary of STAFF TRYING TO SELL a bigger size crab. a small crab can do !!!
5
Nice place, croweded, a little noisy but with quick service, little expensive but good value with excellent taste of seafood ! We ordered Set A, it's really too much, we enjoyed.
4
Nice seafood. Bit busy. Sometimes hard to attract the attention of one of the staff, but the food is delicious. A bit expensive though.
5
Before going to Singapore I did a lot of research on the best place to get Singapore Chilli Crab, every article written on the matter mentioned Jumbo Seafood, so I was ready to make my booking when reservations opened online 45 days before dining. I thought this might be overkill, but due to the warnings of long queue times i wanted to be safe rather than sorry. Just as well as when we arrived for our booking at 8.30pm there would have been no less than 40 people waiting for a table without a reservation. We didn't need to wait at all and were shown straight to our table. I was concerned by the constant reminders that you only have the table for 1hr and 15mins but this turned out to be more than ample time.And my god, the Chilli Crab is good. It is better than we had ever had, better than we anticipated, better than I can describe- just amazing. We had 9 fried mantou between 2 of us, the crab was massive and cost SNG$76, which we thought was very reasonable. I would recommend Jumbo to anyone
5
Having dinner with my family and friends, it is our first time visit to Jumbo Seafood Restaurant. It definitely surprised me and gave us unforgettable experience!! The restaurant is decent, the staff are nice and helpful, and of course, the most important thing, the food is so good and delicious We have ordered both Black pepper crab and Chili crab. The appearance of the black pepper crab is far better than those in other food centre, less black but the pepper taste is just right and good. This crab is 1kg, i think it is good for 2-3ppl.For the chili crab, the sauce is little bit chili with sour and sweet, it is perfect to eat with the steamed buns this crab is 1.3 kg, good for 4 ppl. So i recommend you should try both of them, you would never regret!We have also ordered 2 types of prawns, the cereal prawn and chili salt prawn. The cereal one is with little bit sweet, the chili one is like chinese style. It is $20 each, the prawns are fresh and the seasoning is good too!The fish is cooked with some seasonings, i like it very much, the fish is good for 4-6ppl. And the last thing i recommend is the seafood fried rice, there are crab, prawn and scallop inside, the rice tastes so good, even better than the chinese style, it is a much try item too!At in all, i think you must visit Jumbo seafood for your Singapore trip, it is the best seafood restaurant i have tried in Singapore.After dinner, you can walk along the clarke quay riverside to see the nice night view

This restaurant was recommended to us for the chilli crab.We were lucky enough to get a lunch time table without reservation and ordered the crab. Price is 'seasonal' and not specified on the menu. It turned out to be pretty expensive really. The crab arrived and it is big, and drenched in a chilli sauce (not too hot though). All the legs and claws are still intact, so you need to break these open to get at the meat. It is a bit too much like hard work for me, and you do get in a real mess.We did order another dish as well (before we knew how big the crab would be). It was deep fried cod fish in spicy sauce. WOW, that was absolutely lovely.Bear in mind the dishes come with no other rice or noodles etc. So you need to order these separately if you want these to accompany your dish
5
Having read some of the other reviews on this esteemed site, I was a bit worried about getting a table here especially as it was around 8pm on a Saturday evening. But I thought I'd wander up anyway as so many people had recommended the chilli crab and I was really craving it. There was a big crowd of people waiting for tables so things didn't look good. Undeterred, I entered my details into the little machine what manages their queuing system and settled in for a long wait. But much to my surprise, ten minutes later I had a table! I think it's because I ticked the box saying I didn't mind sharing with others. It's certainly worth considering if you don't fancy waiting too long as sitting at a big round table with a bunch of strangers isn't really that bad.The chilli crab was totally amazing. He was big, tasty and beautifully cooked in a delicious chilli sauce that had just about the right level kick to it. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Devouring the beast is all part of the fun but it's certainly a messy affair so maybe this isn't a good choice for a first date. My tip is to just keep on eating no matter how messy your hands get. If you start licking and cleaning too early you'll probably never stop. Do wear the silly paper bib provided too or risk ruining your shirt. And don't forget to order some fried buns to soak up the sauce. They're pretty small so make sure you get a few.It's far from cheap. The crabs are sold by weight and my big boy came in at S$70. Throw in a some obligatory buns, a couple of beers, tax & service and the bill came to just over S$100. I was totally stuffed so conceivably this could be enough for two if you order a couple of side dishes
5
We walked into Jumbo Riverside for lunch for their renown crab that have had many raving reviews but did not prepare ourselves for this!1kg chilli crab x2 for the two of us (yes we're greedy foodies) at a cost of $202. At first one may think that's expensive but when you have experienced the meats that fill every crevice of a large crab, you would not complain at all! Definitely the best crab we've had the whole trip, and when you take into account the heavier the crab, the greater the percentage of crab meat to weight ratio, is potentially the one of most value (even though some may say cheaper places offer better value crab but we felt the crab meat portion was perhaps closer to ~60% of the 1kg even though the overall weight was an 800g crab.
1
This outlet charges you an insanely expensive price of S$198/kg for chili crab, compared to S$60~70 in other places. The manager purposely sell us the higher priced crabs and didn't disclose the cheaper option. Do not go unless you don't care about money.
5
The Chilli crab is Die Die must try. I still don't believe that Jumbo lost to Gordon Ramsay. Probably Gordon.
5
It is expensive: S$ 70. But worth it. A little bit spicy but ok. They give gloves, clothes protector and the tools to break the crab.

I've been going to Jumbo restaurants for over 20 yrs. The food is good but prices have been creeping up. This particular outlet should be avoided. First the overpricing. Me and my wife had the basic lunch set for 2. Cost....$180+. We asked to change the chili crab to black pepper crab - sorry absolutely no variation allowed.Second the poor food. The starters were ok but not $180 standard. When the highlight crabs came, they tasted pre-cooked. Probably a huge batch cooked at once. The meat was dry and brittle unlike a freshly live crab. Finally the service. We arrived just before 12pm without reservations. There was a crowd waiting to get in. We were asked to share a big table with others. This has never happened to us in all our years dining at Jumbo. We shared our table with 4 others, all tourists. In fact, most of the customers appeared to be tourists. The young couple next to us ordered a crab and a lobster but not much else. They looked shocked when the bill came. After paying they asked us what the 10% and 7% were for and so we explained. Then we realized why they were shocked. Their bill was almost $600! Lunch for 2!Wow. We are staying away from this particular Jumbo from now on.
4
Whenever I am in Singapore I always make sure I make it to east coast to jumbo. It is a really fun experience . Beer in jugs and chili crab - which can be a little messy and hard to eat, salt and pepper lobster, steamed gem fish are all great choices including the samba prawns.I always leave pretty happy and content, it's a very relaxed atmosphere and have been with the children on previous occasion

I try making a reservation for Riverside Point outlet but was immediately informed they are full house.So I make the reservation at Riverwalk. The lady who handled my reservation was kind of rude. When I attempt to make a reservation for the crab. She told me: “you are arriving at 2130 hours and you still want to make a reservation for the crab?” So does the timing of me arriving differentiate the ability for me to make the reservation for the crab? I make the reservation for 2 pax and the lady reply was like: “there is only 2 of you why should you make reservation for the crab?” So when it is not a group of 10 pax, you don’t allow the customer to make crab reservation? Just because the spending amount is less than that of the 10 pax? She even said: “if you make the reservation for the crab, when you come, you cannot say you don’t want it”. If they post this attitude to every of their customer, is quite rude. Just because there are some customer who reserved crabs and after that decided to change their decision and you super impose this thought on other customer is rather unfair to them. The lady later informed me that the crab by 2130 hours will all be the size of 900g-1kg however when I reach, they said they only have 1.3kg as the smallest. Seem like the product knowledge isn’t that good? Just trying to smoke her way to not take my reservation for the crab.On the other hand, the dining experience was much better, we manage to get a rather spacious space for the 2 of us. The service staff also have a much better attitude. The chilli crab taste was as usual good with consistency regardless of outlets or timing. Other dishes that we order like donut with seafood paste, deep fried beancurd special and seafood fried rice may seems to be on par with the usual Chinese restaurant.However, the service attitude of a few staff was rather good, packing my take-away rather quickly and a really dedicated staff that actually recognized us when we are in helmet on the road that we still have a box of take-away left behind and whether we would like to collect it

We spent our first night in Singapore and decided to have a look at some seafood restaurants. We came across Jumbo. Complicated menu, which no-one could explain, we had one giant prawn, delicious, then ordered the rice and noodle dishes, was really nice too. Staff weren't very friendly, not sure if it was the language barrier or not

A small note before I continue. There are two Jumbo Seafood restaurants in Clarke Quay area. I can not remember if this is the one we went too or if it was the other. In any event, know that there are two (within walking distance) and both are along river. Definitely make reservations if you are going for dinner because both restaurants were crowded. We had chili crab and it was great and messy. There are probably many more places that are better and cheaper. The location along the river at night with boats floating by and lights of Clarke Quay adds to the experience.

Jumbo's was on my list this visit to Singapore and the Chilli crab is famous. I arrived early one evening and only had to wait for 20 minutes for a share table. I dined with a delightful family from Shanghai and despite a small language barrier we enjoyed a pleasant dinner. My chilli crab was delicious but at $83 AUD not cheap and when you add the taxes it was a bit over $100! It is sold by weight so as long as you ask when you order you are aware of this then there isn't any shocks when the bill arrives

Great chili crab dinner. We had the dinner for 4 and the amount of food was perfect for us. Service was good. Location is outstanding on Clarke Quay. Get there early or have reservations.

Always come here whenever I come to Singapore. I love its singaporean chili crab. The crab was big and tasty. I also ordered the salted egg prawn. It also tasted good!

We enjoyed some lovely seafood here - seemed quite expensive to me however what we ordered although it didn't seem like much to us - was a lot of food coming out and all very rich and filling. Was an enjoyable evening.

We were really frustrated. Waiting 1 hour outside for a meal (standing because not enough chairs for everyone). Some dishes ordered could not come up but they didn't inform until payment. Extra buns order ignored. Terrible attitude from a wait staff. I'm so definitely sure about a "never coming back again"

Went for dinner. Group of 6 of us. We normally frequent the one in east coast but that is closed so decided to try this one. It was a Friday night so very crowded and quality of food is def not as good as the one in east coast.

4 of us called and ordered the set meal . The starter was a fish soup and was very good followed by a mushroom dish and then prawns coated with cereal these were very tasty . The chilly crab was good although you have to pick and crack to get all the meat then followed the tasty dessert of sago and shaved ice also very nice all this for 260 Singapore dollars not bad

I have been to this very restaurant quite a few times, but each time I left less and less impressed by the flavour, service or the value for money of it all. The crabs are 'supposed' to be live crabs but not always does it taste fresh, which can be really annoying after having to line up for a table for a while. The rest of the dishes on the menu are just average at best. Being a really busy restaurant I dont feel the dishes were made with care and attention, but rather food items heated through on a stove with a bit of sauces slapped on it. I used to love Chilli crabs in Singapore but thanks to Jumbo, I find resistance in me against this famous institution. Singapore is a food city and there are tons more better tasting food at much better value

Made reservations online and found our way easily to this branch. Opted to sit inside the air conditioned section due to hot weather. Since we had some light meal around 10am, we ordered just chilli crab, fried mantou and a bowl of rice to share. The waitress suggested against ordering vegetables as the portions are likely too large to finish especially since we had already eaten earlier. It was a finger-licking experience though the price is on the high side. But it was a good meal and we didn't have much problem with getting the attention of staff. Do be ready to spend SGD 40-60 per pax and add in 10% service charge, and 7% GST of top of that

It was late Tuesday afternoon as we were deciding where to go for a chilli crab dinner. We asked the hotel reception for a recommendation as we were leaving and were told to go to JUMBO in Clarke Quay. We saw that JUMBO was also featured in our guidebook so we decided to give it a try. There are 2 JUMBO restaurants within 5 mins walking distance in Clarke Quay.We called up one to make a reservation and were told they were fully booked. So we called the other one and were told the same thing. We could however, try our luck by turning up to the restaurant without a reservation.So we arrived at JUMBO Riverside (better location and view) without a reservation and found the wait time for non-reservations to be 40 minutes. We were told that the other restaurant (JUMBO Seafood Gallery - 5 mins walk down the riverwalk) had an immediate table for us so we accepted. The staff at Riverside made a quick call to Seafood Gallery to reserve the table for us and handed us a reservation slip to bring.We leisurely strolled along the riverwalk to get to the other restaurant, handed over the reservation slip and were quickly seated at a table inside. We were then told that the time limit at our table is 90 minutes, which was OK for us.We ordered the Chilli crab ($75/Kg) and thought 1KG was good between the 2 of us. The fried bread is good to dip but are quite small. I think 3 or 4 bread rolls per person is a good amount. We also ordered some other dishes which were OK. The chilli crab was great, though. I was licking the sauce off my fingers by the end of our meal.The service and staff seemed extremely rushed, which is understandable, and the restaurant setting seemed very ordinary. The pricing was also a little expensive
