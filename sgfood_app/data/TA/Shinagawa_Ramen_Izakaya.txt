Their menu do not have a wide variety to choose from, was searching for tamago or tamago yaki on their menu and realise they don't serve that.

The signature ramen here is good! Good service and easy to order through the ipad. Food was delicious and of good quality. Didn't have to wait too long too

Did not think such old school Japanese restaurants exist anymore. The decor is reminiscent of a bygone era, of neighbourhood eateries catering to the local clientele. Shinagawa does the same, serving its customers with dedication with decent meals.

Had unagi don 2 days in a row with Eatigo app. 1st for lunch at 2.30pm without realising it closes at 3pm. I was the last customer yet food took v long to come. It was gd so I went again next day for dinner. Wat a mistake. Super crowded, super slow and lots of bones in unagi this time round. Got orders wrong too. Pls avoid gg during wkday dinner time. Restaurant was tucked away in a corner so wasn't easy to find too. Staff were pleasant but simply couldn't cope.

You can trust the recommended items on the menu as they are really worth ordering. But pls check your bill carefully before paying, as their digitalised menu has the worst user interface ever!... not for older people with bad eyesight or those who get confused with digital menus. Promotions are also not programmed into the digital menu and have to be manually adjusted at the cashier, which is error prone. Lastly you should not be extremely hungry when you visit this restaurant, as the food takes forever to arrive :

Finding out about this place from a local app Eatigo and got a half price promo all a la carte menus.The Chirashi Don was awesome, fresh and really generous fish meats and eggs.We ordered the Spider Maki, Shinagawa Signature Ramen Set. All was satisfying. We ordered a fresh juice, turned out to be a packed juice and we did not like the taste.The best way to reach its location is by going out from Tj Pagar MRT, take Exit C and when you go into the International Plaza building, try to find the unit number.I won't mind coming back again to this Restaurant, especially with the promotion going on

Was here on a weekend afternoon for lunch. Well, the place seems to be famous though because it's at a spot where I don't even know existed yet there's a large crowd waiting to come in.Food was pretty good. Pretty large size for myself and the soup base was good. Affordable price especially it's located at city area! Gosh! However, people tend to get one or two friends to queue early and they order the food early then a whole bunch of them comes in. I find that the place needs to step up and do something about it. Overall, it was pretty nice for a simple lunch there

A good friend suggested lunch at Shinagawa through Eatigo so 4 of us visited Shinagawa yesterday lunchtime. We ordered their speciality ramen and a bento box with salmon sashimi, tempura, as well as garlic fried rice. The meal was satisfying, service was satisfactory, and their F&B Marketing Manager Mr Lim is simply charming. We were overwhelmed when Mr Lim gave us complimentary desert platter to sample at the end of our meal, and the invoice was the biggest surprise - all for less than $50!We will be back

We came here on a Saturday which was great. Coming to the CBD on a Saturday evening is nice as there is no crowd and finding a parking lot is not a problem. The service staff were very friendly and helpful. They gave my kids sweets which made them very happy. As it was a Saturday, there was ample space for our large family of 8. The menu selection is wide from Ramen to sushi to Udon. We had the Ramen which was recommended and ordered an array of sharing dishes. The Spider Maki (soft shell crab) is good. The Ramen wad also good. The Ramen has add on options which we found useful for the various tastes in my family (spicy; non-spicy; meat eater; vege only eater; etc). Overall, a nice place. We enjoyed our meal and will be back
