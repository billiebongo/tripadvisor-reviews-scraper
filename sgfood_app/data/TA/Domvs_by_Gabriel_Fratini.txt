Gabriel has different degustations nightly, along with extensive Italian wine list. great guy to talk to re his own paintings on the walls of the restaurant

Like the ambience. Good for business talk. Great food and service is good too! Thumbs up! Will definitely go back there for future business dinner

Wouldnâ€™t recommend coming for the food, unless you need somewhere private and quiet for business dinner.

The Domvs dining experience was unique because it felt intimate.The chef welcomed and seated us.He introduced us a good value Abruzzo from Montepulciano which was excellent. Rated 90-93 on multiple websites online.The menu of $128 came with four appetisers, one huge pasta and one main, followed by one dessert.No anuse bouche or petit fours as it is Italian not French:)The first two appetisers came rather fast. Made you feel it was all ready to serve.Smaller portions, one prawn and one pork cube.The next two appetisers were bigger in portions, scallops with risotto and grilled chicken with cheese.They all tasted very good.The pork ravioli was main course size, 3 huge ravioli. Good.The barramundi was good served on spinach.The dessert trio comprised tiramisu, lemon meringue and panna cotta. Good but not excellent.Overall a positive experience. Very good value for $128

On the new year eve, on 30th December 2017, my signature degustation dinner with Celebrity Chef Gabriel Fratini was awesome, his special degustation menu, always kept us surprised â€¦ and special thing is that the interaction with Gabriel time to time and sharing Pinot Grigio with him reminds me my days in Milan, Rome ! It was a perfect evening before new year. Serving was perfect, interior was splendid, the decoration was augmented by the his own painting
4
I donâ€™t know about the price since my colleague invited but I really enjoyed the food. Chef was very attentive and took care of our preferences.Place was not very full but I can say that this has been one of the best non Michelin restaurants I have been in Singapore.Will return

Celebrated my wifeâ€™s birthday with our son recently. The previous time we visited (i.e. in 1995) was to celebrate our intention to marry. We enjoyed ourselves with the 7-course dinner (without a menu) this time round. Liked the ravioli and the barramundi dishes. Excellent service rounded off a wonderful evening.
5
DOMVS by Gabriel Fratini40 years of savoir faire - Italian cuisine at its best, refined but direct - no cheating - beautiful ingredients and flavorsThe six course menu was as much as pleasure for the mouth as it was a pleasure for the eye
5
I am genuinely surprised this restaurant doesn't have a queue right outside the door. The food was amazing, the service excellent, and Chef Gabriel Fratini a very gracious host. The omakase-style dining added to the experience: every dish was a wonderful surprise. The wine -- a cab and a pinot grigio (recommendations of the chef) -- went very well with the food. The dessert, especially the tiramisu, rounded up the meal nicely. Definitely worth a visit (or 2 or 3!), but only if you're an adventurous foodie as there's no menu
2
Had made a booking for 4, without realizing this was Italian restaurant without any menu i.e. omakase, relying on chef's discretion to cook a 5 course menuWhen we wanted to cancel the booking, he insisted he could just do 1 dish each. The Pasta & Pork & Fish dishes we ordered weren't bad; but the Chef's almost unfriendly demeanor & a largely empty restaurant made it a very unusual & disappointing evenin
5
I approached my dinner with super high expectations because i knew chef Fratini and he explained me his concept and the restaurant's mission. I was super delighted: a culinary experience, a trip between a superior mix of flavours!!!
Thks Gabriel for that!!!!

For my experience service good and restaurants Princess Lazo very friendly, bathroom also Clean I wish only have free Wi-Fi will be perfect ðŸ˜„. So keep smile for all staff Sheraton hotel I will see you next month for my other trip. Cheers April

This was the first of my two omakase Italian lunches over the weekend. I made a visit to Fratini La Trattoria the next day and will also review it shortly. Let's get back to DOMVS.Made a reservation via Chope about a week before and had indicated our food preferences. On the day of the lunch, once we settled in, we were greeted by the Chef and he had noted our preferences (even said he had gone to the market that morning to get the lobster ;) ) He however reconfirmed our dietary requirements. He shared some ideas he had and asked some questions about our preference for mains. He also picked out a beautiful red wine to go with our meal. The portions of the meal were just right for us. The food was very good - simple yet flavourful. We had a 4 course meal. Started with an appetizer of 3 dishes comprising scallop, prawn and beef. This was tasty and left us wishing there was more. Then we had our lobster pasta followed by grilled sea bass for our mains. Both were perfect. The fish was well done (no fishy taste or smell). We then ended with a tiramisu ( perfect - light and not so sweet version) and some Panna cotta. I downed the meal with a very good cup of black coffee. The meal on the whole was very good and the chef did serve and check on us at least thrice during the meal.The ambience of the restaurant was interesting with many paintings with the chef's namesake and service from the chef was personal and warm. The other wait staff were professional and efficient. The price though not low was reasonable for the experience. We are planning a return visit soon

This restaurant has been in Sheraton Towers Hotel for many years. Now it is headed by celebrity chef Gabriel Fratini. The unique feature of this restaurant is there is no menu. The chef will cook whatever is fresh and best that is available. There are set dinner and lunch menus.We had a big group for lunch, about 35. The staff was very attentive and Chef Fratini was always there to ensure the guests are very well taken care of. He always put on a big smile and personally made sure the the orders for main course are correctly taken. His presence has made the ambience more jovial and comfortable. The starter consisted of squid, prawn and truffle meat. The squid was delicious and just the right tenderness. The prawn was fragrant and succulent. The second dish was ravioli stuffed with salmon and meat. To me its Italian wanton, This dish was really good. The combination of salmon and meat gave an interesting flavour. My main course was lamb. When it first came my first thought was "why such a small piece?" Anyway, it was also another great dish. The desert consisted of tiramisu and a pudding. The tiramisu has a light and refreshing taste.The pudding was normal.I was full after taking all the food although I thought the piece of lamb was small. This place can be considered expensive for lunch but compared to some other fine dining restaurants, it is good value for money
5
We have been fans of Gabriel for a long time and have followed him since we discovered his Greenwood restaurant. The food still surprises and portions that are slightly larger then before but smaller quantity. The standout was the ravioli as well as the Lamb chops and fish (main). The different taste explosion was less pronounced (which is why we fell in love with his style of cooking where he paired Interesting combinations) but still one of our Favourite restaurants.
5
Gabriel Fratini unfailingly serves great food embellished with his personal attention to each diner's palate. All my guests, who were visiting on business from overseas, were impressed by their respective choice of main course (sea bass, lamb and pork) as well as Gabriel's jokes, anecdotes on the provenance of his ingredients - bread rolls from Italy, pork from Bedok Market - and his efficient, professionally discreet team of wait staff.Several of my guests vowed that they will return with their spouses. Gabriel jokingly said he'll treat them even better without me present..
5
We came here because ofvthe UOB credit card 1:1 promotion for set meal which is really reasonable!But truly wow-ed us was the food! EVERY dish was amazing! My favorite was the Ricotta Cheese Ravioli! It sent us to food heaven!Portions are not large. You can inform the restaurant what you are allergic to but other than that, the set meal dishes will be decided by the restaurant.With the food this good, we did wonder why the restaurant was less than half-filled. I guess being located inside Sheraton Towers, it is far away from the hip and trendy crowd. Such a waste. I would wish to see the restaurant move to some where more central and I am sure the crowds will flock here.Rating for food: 9/10 (yes, it was really excellent)Rating for service: 9/10Set lunch cost S$5
5
A different kind of dining experience: no menu; just Chef Fratini serving up fresh and tasty bites of a variety of meats and seafood with interesting sauces and dressings! I particularly loved the ravioli with salmon and ricotta cheese. The recommended wine was excellent. Ambience was luxurious yet cosy and service impeccable
3
Last visited the restaurant more than 20 years ago and the impression at that time was a very 'high class' Italian restaurant. The ambience now is still cosy but the standard of food has definitely dropped. The fillet of fish was way too salty and I have to send it back. There are many restaurants did better tiramisu than them. Well, they have to work harder on getting true authentic Italian food right because there are so many good Italian restaurants around nowadays
5
Amazing dinner suggested by Chef Fratini in this really nice restaurant that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have menu but only fresh daily plates. the quality of the raw material is outstanding and combination of taste of traditional Italian food and sophisticated creations make this restaurant one of the best in townone of the best selection of wines at very good prices compared to other restaurants it was a great experienceGrazie Gabriel !!!
5
Second time here. And only one comment:
Excellent..Redigaffi wine 2010 and a 6 course dinner at it's best
5
Glad to find that the standards of food and service are still excellent. Had a very delightful experience.
4
Brought my friend here to celebrate her birthday. It wasn't crowded at all on a Sunday afternoon. We were given a corner table and we took the set lunch. The servings are small but quality is good. We took a leisurely 1.5 hour lunch. Service is commendable. This restaurant is on level 1 of Sheraton Hotel which is just 3 minutes walk from Newton Station.
3
For dinner, they started the "no menu" dinner which means it's chef's choice.Overall we had a enjoyable dinner though a couple of dishes served was lukewarm but other than that, it was nice but pricy at $128++ .........beverages not included.But compliments must be given to our male server, I think he might be a Singaporean Eurasian (didn't get to ask him) .........this senior uncle took pride in his job and we are very pleased with his service.My rating of this restaurant is..........Average for food because it's pricy yet some items were served lukewarm.Very good for service because of the senior Eurasian server
5
Don't miss Domus. Gabriel Frattini does a fantastic Italian interpretation of the omakase style found in Japanese restaurants. This is a modern way to eat Italian. Relax, and let him treat you to a delightful series of dishes. Of course you get to tell him any dislikes or allergy issues. Then come the surprises. The food combinations and taste subtleties will wow you.The wine selection is superb. Service is as outstanding as the cuisine
5
I often have business lunches at the Sheraton Towers due to proximity, and DOMVS is the preferred go to restaurant. Since Chef Fratini took over the restaurant, the standards have been excellent. I have never been disappointed on my visits. The chef will personally come to meet you and explain the menu options. Each dish is visually impeccable and authentic and Chef Fratini will come before each course to explain whats next.Add to that the personalised service and it makes for a great meal. The staff are attentive but never intrusive, which allows for undisturbed meetings. Well done
5
Our meal was served promptly. We had the set lunch which had appetizers, a pasta course, a main and a desert. Really liked the pasta course which was a ravioli with cheese, eggplant. We had the beef adn lamb for the mains which was really tasty and done very nicely. The restaurant has a rich wood feel. Wide selection of wine. Had a really good time. Recommende
5
This was a pleasant experience to have the proprietor visit our table to welcome us with a complimentary glass of prosecco. Instead of menus, he requested any food allergies and dislikes and said he would prepare a surprise for us. And it was, each course was better than the previous, with a selection of dishes to delight the most discerning palates! And the selection of Italian wines, not disappointing! We enjoyed a 2007 Brunello di Montalcino which was so delicious, we enjoyed a second one. Thank you Gabriel!

Went to Domvs for dinner. Food and Service is decent. But question is exactly what is included in the dinner. When we review the website of Sheraton Towers it says Dinner menus: From $128++ (includes 4 appetisers, 2 pasta, 2 main courses and desserts).On the actual night we had 4 appetisers, 1 pasta and 2 main courses (a tiny piece of fish and a small, little piece of meat) plus 1 dessert and yet we were charged $148 per head. So can Sheratons Towers and DOMVS pls tell your customers what exactly is included in the $128 dinner pls? So that at least your customer can decide what they want to spend or don't want to spend at the restaurant. But at least, the restaurant should stay accurate to what you commit on your website. Right
4
You don't get a menu. Just the chef confronting you, like a particularly stroppy frontier guard , telling you that you will enjoy the set menu. Or else.Good thing is; I did. It was all bloody marvelous especially the salmon ravioli in truffle butter while my Indian vegetarian colleague rolled not literally in an inventive tasty menu that made me feel less guilty about dragging him in there. Great fun even if the welcome could make you feel less like a naughty schoolboy caught wielding behind the bike she
3
We had the four course omakase lunch menu. The food was rather tasty, but Honestly, it wasn't spectacular. But the service from the staff was very good.
2
I've been to this restaurant a week ago. The food was great, no argue with that, but everything else was a nonsense. It took the 3.5h to serve the dinner and the bill was much higher than expected. will not recommend
4
Come here for fine Italian food with a good selection of wine. One of the better Italian restaurant in Singapore.
Ambience is also very nice.
5
Salmon Ravioli comes in a small portion and is very tasty. Enough for a person like me who eats little and enough for 3 course.
5
Great food. Excellent service. Superb ambience. The cuisine is very creative and well presented. The service is attentive and personalized. Look forward to tasting more of grabriel's creations every time.
5
I was on business in Singapore and stayed at the Sheraton Towers. My business associate and I decided to have dinner inside the hotel, and we went to the DOMVS by Gabriel Fratini, the Italian restaurant inside the hotel. We were very impressed with the very high quality of food and the exceptional service. Chef Fratini came around our table and asked what we liked to eat, and he proceeded to prepare dishes which were tailored to our tastes. The food was so good...I would go as far as to say that this was the best Italian food that I had outside of Italy! The service was also exceptional! I will definitely be back, and would highly recommend this restaurant
5
My family had the 4-course lunch "omakase" and we were treated to a lovely 3 item salmon/chicken appetiser, chicken and burrata ravioli and a melt-in-your-mouth pork escalope. The tiramisu and chocolate mousse rounded up our 2- hour meal and we left thoroughly satisfied. The older wait staff are more attentive and thoughtful. The chef himself painted most of the works hanging in the restaurant so see if you can identify the partial self-portraits he has embedded in them ;
2
I went to DOMVS with my friend's introduction. I enjoyed most of the dinner but felt the ravioli not to my liking. I was 70% full from the meal which is comfortable considering it was dinner. However, I do feel pressured by the chef to order a particular bottle of wine. He has a sense of humour but I feel unnecessary pressured by him. Top it off, I felt that the price of the dinner with the alcohol was rather expensive
5
It was a very interesting experience, i really enjoyed everything in this place! If you choose to come eat here take note that there's no menu, the chef decides mostly what you eat and as strange as it may sound, it's really great... This guy is so creative, i was surprised by the combinations and the individuality of his art! Desserts were delicious and the wine suggested by the somelier(max) was absolutely divine!
4
One of those time where you just couldn't believe how 'little' you paid for such a beautifully crafted tasting menu. While I'm no food connoisseur, below is my humble opinion of the dining experience. You know how some dishes are often overpowered by the condiments or the sauces, or how others may have so many strong distinct tasting notes in one dish that you felt it was a clash of titians. Well, we were fortunate enough to discover well balanced dishes with elements that complement each other nicely and yet at times give a pleasant surprise to the palate. It is even more amazing to find Chef Gabriel very personal and his trusted service staff very attentive. Price just doesn't justify the quality and variety here. I do hope that more people get to be aware of this gem and give it a try. U never know what exciting dishes may await you
5
A very unique and very good culinary experience. Gabriel makes unforgettable. Will be back definitely.
5
I traveled to Singapore on business
and I was recommended the Italian restaurant DOMVS by Gabriel Fratini I was surprised by the welcome and the competence
of all, delicious food and fine wines, excellent
5
Excellent lunch with ravioli handmade, delicate, light, delicious and, as second course, magnificent seabass with sauce unforgettable and superbe wine! Congratulation better then Italy
5
I visited this nice restaurant because I was told that the chef is unique. After having the 128 dollar set I have understood what do they mean with unique chef. Every single customer eat different things according to their dietary requirements. I had 4 bites of appetisers then ravioli then the best ravioli I ever had plus fish main course and dessert all outstanding. Congratulations for the manager Max as well.
4
My dearest hubby brought us to this wonderful Italian Omakase restaurant for our Belated Valentines Dinner. Every dish was executed with perfection & beauty. My son who lives to eat compliments every single dish that was served. His favorite was the creamy sea urchin on lightly sautÃƒÂ© scallop accompanied with sweet potato paste.
5
I was at Domvs with my friends and it's been the best Italian cuisines for months since my last visit at Gabriel's old restaurant!From the serving bread goes all the way to the deserts, you can feel the passion and love of cooking from Chef Gabriel!Talk is cheap and words are free, just pay a visit and you'll understand what I mean!Domvs by Gabriel Fratini is probably the best Italian restaurant in Singapore
5
I am glad Gabriel is back and this time with the best food and service. I love everything in that restaurant from the private wine collection to his own oil paintings. The food is constant TOP quality with every detail carefully prepared by Gabriel himself. He often brings and explains the dishes to us himself and we become very good friends after the meal.This restaurant is a piece of art created by the owner with all his effort. I very much appreciate the fine personalised experience it has offered to me and my friends
5
Without doubt the best meal we have ever had. This is a restaurant that when you allow them to do what they excel in you will be overwhelmingly delighted. The food was amazing and service impeccable. We had 8 courses of the most amazing food we have ever been presented with. The passion and enthusiasm of Gabriel and his staff is the best we have ever experienced. It was the most expensive meal that I have ever paid for, but it was so good we did not mind and I even tipped the staff beyond that. We will definitely eat there again on our next trip to Singapore
5
Within a week I went for dinner and I went again for lunch. I think it is Italian cooking at its finest. There isn't any menu. You leave it all to Chef Gabriel. It is Omakase, or menu degustation. Of course you have to communicate with him your preferences and your food allergies, if any. And he must be a good judge of his customers, giving you a tailored menu.I must confess I have a particular fondness for those who know their work thoroughly and excel at it. He is one of them. Rest assured that he cooks with the freshest ingredients. Not only does he order his ingredients overseas, he also visits the wet market in Bedok every morning for the local seafood pick of the day!There is a nice mix of meat, seafood and pasta. I am most impressed with the giant raviolis with salmon and burrata filling, dressed with the lightest butter sauce which he gave me at dinner. And for lunch that other day, he cooked the most delicious pork loin, paper thin, fully cooked yet tender and juicy, with a lovely gravy.I like him, I respect him, and I love his food
5
I picked up Domvs By GF based on web search and reviews for a special day celebration. We booked for late hours (late for the Restaurant timing) but Chef Gabriel was there to welcome us, and the rest became history. He asked about our liking and then tailor made a four-course dinner and a dessert for us, and it was one of its kind experience. The personal touch of Chef and his team made us feel at home, and the food was doing magic on our palate. We liked every bit of our experience that made it memorable
5
NYE dinner 2016 with with 3 friends. Magnificent 8 course degustation. Service perfection, staff so friendly and informative so everyone at table felt special. Gabriel Fratini is the wonderful chef who personally helped serve several courses and was always there to describe in detail the course being eaten. His faultless detail to find any food allergy or food not liked liked so he could make alternative course is a first for me. His degustation menu is changed daily and I will be back same within 2 days. Wine advice from Maitre'D 1st bottle and Gabriel 2nd bottle. Both recommendations were brilliant. Gabrile should gave a Michelin rating as everything about restaurant is perfect. Not expensive and not cheap by Singapore standards. This is a must dine at Restauran
5
We decided to have our year end dinner at Domvs cos as usual we had craving for the wonderful food there. This time round Gabriel didn't disappoint, of cos, and serve up some amazingly beautiful dishes. Loved the triple pork dish and the visually spectacular red prawn with caviar. We wish all at Domvs a Happy New Year and see u guys soon...next year!
5
There can only be one.... We tracked Gabriel all the way from Greenwood to Domvs. He has never failed to delight with creations which look like art pieces and taste just heavenly. At lunch last week, we had another great experience savouring the complex flavours of three very different but complementary starters, went on to pasta cooked to the perfect Al Dente firmness with Vongole galore. The chicken infused pork fillet was out of this world while the succulent prawn and fish come with the full flavour of their ocean freshness. We will certainly be back again
5
This place is helmed by its original chef once again. Now with Assaggini styled arrangements, be sure to let your palates be teased by the culinary positive trickery with homey taste of present meets past. Chef fratinni blends both, teasing both mind and palate. If connan mcgregor was a chef, he will say " in the first round I will rearrange your palate" . Come here and get your expectations be rearranged. This is a game changer, no longer is the old domvs and dim lit place, now it's a wine extravaganza with fantastic food. Come back those of you who went to frattinni'
5
In the last month I always find any excuse to go at Domus, sometimes for business lunch, sometime with friends or family, sometimes for dinner but i still going also alone and just sit down and enjoy the food and the wine..!I guess it is a kind of "" Domus addiction "" and the chef Gabriele is propably using magic ingredients.... again and again and again : The Best Fine Dining in Asia.... good Job Gabriele and Massimo
5
My family 3rd visit after Domvs by Chef Gabriel Fratini's opening.Taste of every dish is mind blowing with gorgeous presentation, wide range of wine which compliments amazingly well, elegant and cozy ambiance with chef Gabriel's paintings as decoration. Service is beyond excellence. Our top favorite restaurant
5
Today I had to discuss some business and my client, who is Italian, suggested we go to Domus at the Sheraton. I had not yet being there, to my loss, I must say! The atmosphere is opulent, like in a Fellini movie, yet tasteful. The very professional Maitre D', Massimo, cheerfully welcome us and introduced us to the famous chef Gabriel Frattini. Once informed that my client was vegetarian, the Chef took all information to make sure to satisfy this requirement in the tastiest possible way. Chef Fratini in fact does choose every day different fresh ingredients and creates his Menu according to his inspiration. It was like in a dream. Suddenly, when the sequence of appetisers morphed into main courses, I had totally forgotten that I was in Singapore, discussing business, and that a long afternoon awaited me. What a tasty choices! Truly a full immersion in La Dolce Vita, with Maitre D' Massimo present but unobtrusive, friendly and always caring, plus the Chef's recommendations made us both feel that we were on a holiday
5
a dinner at domus by gabriel fratini doesn't just limit itself to the eating but offers an experience whole round, his dishes are a mixture of unexpected flavours, colours, odours and even textures comparable to his paintings. What i found very different from other fine dining restaurants was the friendly and homely environment created by the chef and the staff. it was a vibrant experience!!
5
I was extremely impress with the style and atmosphere or the restaurant. I was quite skeptical going to a restaurant where there is no Al La Cate menu and it was based on Set Menu prepared by the Chef. I was so astonished that every stater the Chef prepared was just divine, and mouth watering. The service staff was excellent and know what they were doing. I would highly recommend this place.
5
Gabriel is a genius. In the kitchen and restaurant, he produces delectable morsels that burst with flavor in the mouth. His Pork ravioli were divine, as was the lamb which was done to perfection. Prices are very reasonable and wine list superb.Will come again for dinner soon! And.... he is also a painter and that's his work!!
5
The ingredients the chef used were so fresh and each dish was beautifully created and delicious. Definitely recommend it if you like to pamper yourself a little and have something delicate.
5
Super fantastic dinner with my girl friend!
The Chef Gabriel is great!! Fantastic every dishes!! And the desert is super fantastic!!
Thank you Chef Gabriel, I will come back soon!!
5
What a surprise!!
The new furnished restaurant with a new chef and a new sommelier is excellent. One menu but first class. Highly recommended.
5
So sad that Fratini has sold his restaurant at Greenwood but he has the same charm here - interacting with the guests and making us feel very at home. For the menu, it's Dinner set is around 128 for 4 appetisers, 2 pasta, 2 main courses and desserts is quite worth it but remember it's small portions. I think after the fifth dish, I had enough - so hard to eat some more even though each dish was quite bite size. I didn't like the ambience at this new place but it's still a good place to come for the chef and the food
5
I am leaving in Asia from 1992 and Domus Restaurant is without doubt the best Italian restaurant in Asia. Gabriele the chef is an artist and painter and he can use different colours different texture and create dishes with perfumes and fantastic taste. I had dinner and lunch at Domus already few times and couldnâ€™t wait to go again â€¦.BRAVI 
3
I went there for lunch on Sat...to my surprise , the two of us were the only customers. Sad! I guess not many ppl know about the new chef. The cheese with seafood ravioli n pan-fried fish were good. Nice presentation too. Their white wine by the glass was served in the right temperature (which most restaurants failed to do that). I just wish the decor is better...
5
I went to Domvs 22 years ago and I had a lovely meal, I remembered I always wanted to go back but there was always a new place to try and I never did. Several years back I reviewed Fratini after I was transported to Italy by Gabriel's fresh and dynamic yet homely restaurant. Every dish was delicious!I heard sometime in late 2015 they left the restaurant to a new owner. Somehow I never went to eat there as I felt it could never be the same again. Yesterday a friend invited me to lunch at Domvs. At the door it said Domvs by Gabriel Fratini! I sat down in anticipation to have my tastebuds and mind transported to Italy....Thank you for such a fantastic meal! Tagliatelle in lobster bisque sauce n shrimp and mushrooms just blew my mind
5
Apart from giving you positive surprise dish after dish, Gabriel's warm hospitality and great sense of humour certainly provided additional entertainment at our dinner. Our kids enjoyed every dish, and my fussy daughter who never liked scallops asked for an extra helping. Lamb and beef were excellent too!
5
If you want to escape for some hours to a real Italian place, then visiting Domvs by Gabriel Fratini is a must! Not only because of the Italian way of service and the perfect atmosphere, but mainly because of the great Dinner experience! Im visiting Singapore quite every 2 month for business, and was recently missing Fratini. So i was very happy to hear that he re-open again at the Domvs (Sheraton Towers). I was there for dinner and all of the 9 dishes (4 appetizers, 2 pasta, 2 main and desert) were excellent prepared and extremely tasty! Every single dish is a creation of Fratini which brings the Italian culture of dining on a perfect way to Singapore. Many thanks to Fratini and his team for the great experience they let me feel again, and i will defenitely consider to come back when ever i will visiting Singapore!!
5
Finally Chef Gabriel has come back to Sheraton Singapore, we have been there twice within a month after its opening.Most delicious and beautiful food with Chef Gabriel's 40 years' experience and his miracle touch, best selection of Italian wine at reasonable price. Service is flawless, staff are cheerful and in the meantime capable of achieving fine dining experience.Domvs is more elegant compared to Chef Gabriel's previous restaurant at Greenwood Avenue, suits all occasions, be it for business, romantic dates or family dining, simply amazing
4
Chef will specially prepare meals based on fresh ingredients available. Style is Italian fusion. Wide selection of wines to pair with meal. Good value considering quality.
5
Probably the best Italian lunch I have ever had! Service was excellent and the food was just extraordinary! Chef Gabriel gave me all the footnotes for every dish and you can taste what his brand is all about!
5
Once again, a meal presented by Gabriel is always a pleasure to be shared amongst friends & family. It is filled with surprises. The quality & fresh ingredients used for preparing the meal exceeds all expectations. Lovely & intimate environment. Warm & attentive service. Always a delight to be dining with Gabriel.
5
I had dinner at DOMVS the other night and the entire meal service was amazing. From the crew service to the food, everything was top notch. Even though it's fine dining, I seriously underestimate the hospitality of Italians. The servings were extremely generous, imagine my shock when I realised our main haven't even arrived! My only word of caution is to wear something stretchable. Other than that, expect a truly lovely dinner date.
5
We have dined with Chef Gabriel Fratini before, and so once we heard of his new place, we knew we had to visit. The no menu, leave it up to the chef is something my wife and I really enjoy. Some dishes if listed on the menu, are probably items we wouldn't have thought to try, but gabriel has a way with matching ingredients and it's always a tantalising experience. My wife isn't very adventurous when it comes to food and she's always worried when we dine omakase. But she never worries with Chef Gabriel as he always checks what she's comfortable with and the chef always has plenty of alternatives so she never feels left out. The chef himself does frequent checks on the diners, something a lot of restaurants miss out on. The wait staff were lovely as well. Overall an excellent experience as always
5
Absolutely best Italian omakase in town! Food was fabulous, top quality, the atmosphere is great & service was wonderful. You can't resist chef Gabriel signature ravioli and it was one of the most incredible ravioli I've ever eaten. Everything was perfect, from appetizer to main course. Until we tasted the homemade tiramisu, I have no words to describe the awesomeness of it.... If you want a lovely Italian meal then definitely got to try this place-you won't be disappointed! Just sit back, relax, let the chef take you away..
5
I've visited Chef Gabriel's new restaurant twice last week and it was truly an amazing experience! The reason is I was like going to a FoodArt Museum to enjoy the fine art from Chef Gabriel!There are some many paintings on the wall and all are being created by Gabriel himself. And every dish that he delivered looked like a piece of art with a delicious and exquisite taste!so much has been said and my invitation to everyone is you just can't understand how great the overall experience until you're there
5
Well, it was a fantastic and awesome meal with Gabriel. If you ever dined with Gabriel, you would know that he never disappoint in delivering wonderful food. We were regular at his old place at Greenwood and was sad when we found that he was no longer there. Then one Sunday morn, I chanced upon an article on DOMVS in the Sunday Times and immediately we visited the next day. Experience was great!

Ok, the only improvable point was the service staff who forgot to get us the bottle of wine, but the waiter made this minor mistake up with a really good suggestion of italian red wine at reasonable price.Other than that the set menu was phantastic, too many starters - one better than the other prepared with style and extremely tasty.The Chef comes to find out if everything is prepared to our liking - it really was!He also recommended a exceptional pastry.You want to enjoy an unforgettable food experience with it's price - go there! - you will not regret

The chef has a unique talent in combining ingredients creatively and tastefully. We agreed on a "mostly fish" experience, he went off and came back with a sequence of cold, then warm starters followed by linguine with seafood and an amazing fish as main.Several noticeable things at Domvs, among them- the combination of flavors is unlikely to be experienced anywhere else- despite the many dishes we finished lunch full but not stuffed- the Chef is a amiable and genuine artist, he is the also the author of all paintings on the walls!
