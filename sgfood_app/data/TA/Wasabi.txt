Visited Wasabi on a couple of occasions during a recent stay in Singapore; good quality sushi at a very reasonable price for Singapore!

An authentic Jap store, with only a Chief and a waiteress. Needs to wait but value for money

Japanese food with a certain home-like quality. Small eating area. Need to queue during peak hours

Very affordable and delicious japanese food as long as you can ignore chef's mood... He's quite ok when it's not crowded hehe...

Oh my god, you guys, avid Japanese cuisine lovers, have to come here at least once. The Fish Hot Pot, wooooo~ Their sashimi, very fresh! But don't harbor too high hopes on their service level though. (The chef has a nasty temper when you hurry them your food). And be prepared the queue for at least half an hour
