Fast, healthy and tasty - colleague placed an order and i had the salmon with salad and pasta.. the lemon sauce that accompanied the food was
Good! Filled my tummy but not sluggish and tired’

Not only yummy but healthy too. A welcome change from offerings of bacon and eggs at home. Excellent coffee
5
Stayed in Singapore recently for the F1 GP. After trying a couple of other close by coffee shops we tried here and kept returning. Service was great, and quality of the coffee was first rate, highly recommended.

This place has improved my quality of life; healthy and filling and great variety. The staff in their 100am place is really nice. Also available on deliveroo. The veg options are great. Love the barley and lentil patty along with beets/ carrot, bean sprout salad, beans, cauliflower pickle and avocado

We popped by for a late lunch here during the week. We got one each of the Tantrum & a make your own (Greens, Lentil Patty, various veggies, & the Coconut Dressing). The portion size was decent though not really filling. What was disappointing was the complete lack of flavour in the individual components - they really didn't taste of anything at all. The patty was flat and mushy, and the rest of the veggies were barely passable. The dressings were the only way we got any flavour.We got a Latte to round off the meal and that was the saving grace - it was a good strong cup. We'd not go back unless there are drastic changes to how things taste

Very disappointed with Grain Traders 100AM. I used to be their big fan, patronising them everyday (I have the same choice for lunch daily). In the beginning, their portion size is pretty decent, not great but ok. I had to top up additional protein/toppings to be full. Im not a big eater so their basic portion size is indeed small. After a 6 months hiatus, I decided to give it another shot, only to find out, their portion size has shrunk even further!!! Disappointing and not going back

I come here every time I'm in Singapore. The 'build your own lunch' is great. It is healthy and has gluten free options. You choose a grain, then a protein, a hot vegetable, 2 cold vegetables, a seeded topping and a sauce, all for S$16. Or a lunch package including a drink and a snack for S$19 The service is quick and the food delicious. You could eat here every day for two weeks and have a variety of options. The coffee is really good too. They have inside and outside seating
4
The coffee at Grain Traders is delicious. My favorite is the cortado. The chocolate chip cookies, and yogurt parfait cups by the coffee counter are also good. The "bowls" on the other side of the restaurant are also pretty delicious - the only downside is that it's a pretty steep price for a salad. Oh well, guess I'm a sucker
5
All you need to know is that Grain Traders has the best bagels in all of Singapore. Really that is all you need to know. Oh ok, they do great places/boxes of rice, noodles, etc with different proteins and beans and vegetables, but really its BAGELS BAGELS BAGELS you come here for. Oh and pretty good coffee too
4
Was so happy to see 100amOutlet open on a sunday during my lunch time. I chose to customise my meal- salmon with brocolli and mushroom. The topping which resembled the japanese seaweed with a little salty crust was yummy with my soba base! Be careful of the wasabe mayonniase. It shot into my nose! Overall i like the food here. Healthy and yummy! Gluten free cakes were available too
4
Absolutely delicious side salads and wonderful selection. Delicious pickled cauliflower, tomato & feta, roasted peppers... yum!!! The draw back is that the portion is very small for the price.
5
Mr Pirom is one of my favorite .. it's very healthy Tuna with and wild mushrooms with apple kimchi and soba noodles is a perfect combination !!
4
Diversity of healthy food choices
You will eat based on a variety of choices: grains, meat, 2 hot veggies, 2 cold veggies, nuts, sauce
And you will not starve after this lunch, which can be a challenge in other set-ups
Bon appétit!

I go here very often and it's enjoyable each time . They have no problem making my salmon well done when I ask . Conscientious establishment , such interesting vibrant combinations !
5
Heaven in a plate. So many healthy options, good food and nice spices. Decently priced. Go all the time !
5
I had coffee here today for the first time!! Amazing amazing coffee! If you're a coffee snob then this is the place to go... use papa phaleta beans... a smooth Nutty non-acidic taste... love itHealthy food, Acai bowls, fresh juices... what more can I ask for! Taking my Husband there for breakfast on the weekend
5
one of the best healthy bowls you can get in CBD, or anywhere in Singapore. There classic bowls like Rooster Crow, Upstream are pretty good. At $16, you might not have them everyday but every once a while it's great.Also serve a solid cold brew at $7.
4
I highly recommend Grain Traders for those who want to eat clean or have dietary restrictions. The food is extremely fresh, well prepared, and delicious. I like having the option of making up my own bowl of goodness or ordering off the menu when I am not feeling creative. Staff is lovely. The also make a killer cup of coffee

Grain Traders is another one of those healthy lunch places for CBD workers who don't mind spending $15-20 on lunch. It's the usual protein + carb + veggies + sauce affair only the quality of the food is definitely significantly higher than other similar establishments.I would actually give it a 5* review if it wasn't for the exceptionally tight portion's of protein they give. The standard $16 lunch comes with a pathetic 80g serving of protein (Chicken, Salmon etc) so unless you weigh 45kg and don't exercise, it's pretty likely you will need to double protein, which brings it to nearly $20. The problem is, even when you do order double protein, they literally measure out exactly 160g, which for a gym going 6" man (A significant part of their target audience), really isn't enough. I wouldn't complain if it was $10 but for $20 I really think they could be a bit more generous with the chicken, which isn't exactly a particularly expensive cost. It feels like the place is being run by an accountant rather than a passionate chef and that's a real shame as the food really is tasty and nutritious. I would urge them to think about what is more important, customer satisfaction or maximizing profit margin's by ripping people off
5
Great hangout for a quick and delicious breakfast... There is very seldom a queue (unlike their lunch hour), and you can get a wide range of freshly prepared bagels with a combination of items; sesame Bagel, with double bacon, jalapeno cream cheese and spinach is an absolute winner!! Lunch is really good too
3
I had the oatmeal with coconut and fruit which was a bit to sweet for my taste. I would have preferred more fruit. Their green mint tea is good though.
2
Stopped by for coffee and desserts - The coffee was good but sadly that's about it. The tea we ordered came as a pot of hot water with no tea bag. The Chen pedal crumble was very crumbly! The sticky date pudding cake was hard and very chewy. I'd talk about the service but there was none to speak off. Tables weren't clean and customers carry their trays to a sorry looking tray stand. Not recommended.
4
My friend and I went here for breakfast. The interior was nice, clean, a bit funky in a good way and the employees all seemed quite happy. Restaurant has been open for about a year now (as of April 2017). The food was presented nicely behind glass counters so you could see all the ingredients for your choice of meal. Located on the edge of the CBD. Food was tasty and coffee was very good. I'd go back

I used to frequent Grain Traders for their healthier choice of breakfast and coffee till my last visit. As usual, I am ordering the usual Rancheros. The fateful morning, a young server plated my breakfast then she realised that she ran out of fresh salad, then she reached under the counter for a refill. To my horror, it was a bag of slowly rotting salad greens where it was a shade of darker green and looking "wet" ; despite that, she continue to grab a handful and toss it on my plate then attempt to pick out the darker, wetter, rotten greens individually right in front of the morning queue. I could not believe what I am seeing. Then I graciously told her to remove all the green from my plate as it is bad, then another service staff came over and open a brand new bag of greens and continue service without an apology or explanation of what happen! Training, please guide your front line staff on basic food handling knowledge. Someone could get real sick from eating expired greens. Only trust the coffee, for now.
5
One of my favorite lunch places in Singapore. You get to chose your own base, such as quinoa, salad, brown rice etc, choice of meat or fish, vegetables cold and warm plus condiments. Eat indoor or outside standing by large tables. SGD 16 for a lunch meal not made, given the quality. Really great concept and very fast service. Feels very healthy.
3
If you're a CBD-area worker, you probably have this place figured out already. But if you're not, your first time will probably be a confusing experience. It's not clear how many portions you can have of each type, and the price is unclear too. The sauces can be a bit too overpowering, and you might ruin your bowl with a wrong choice. The cole slaw was extremely bitter. Portions are OK-sized. Try your luck
5
Good food & coffee, presented in a very attractive way. The tastes are amazing and the staff is very kind and helpful (but who isn't in Singapore...). We found this place by accident and in search for a coffee and a breakfast - and came back again the very next day for brunch. Both meals were equally good and I wish we had such a place here on Bali, too
5
This place is right on the money for customer experience. They obviously understand their customers and have crafted a very efficient system to enable you to custom make an excellent meal from a wide variety of fresh cooked foods, including fish and meat, grains, vegetables, ...The coffee is first class, and the 'buy 10 get one free' idea works on an honour system -- you tell us when we owe you a coffee. Outstanding.Only downside: while the queue moves very fast seating is limited. However take away is very well presented
1
Grain Traders offers a healthy option with its variety of grain bowls. The food is fine but both times I met with a less than gracious reception. First time, a server cleared my drink when I got up to swop tables so a party of lunchers could sit together. Today I pointed over the glass partition to indicate a topping but was told by the server to keep behind the glass. She wasn't rude but the manner was not very welcoming either. I wasn't even that close to touching the food. I really don't feel welcome but that is probably my luck in selecting this place.
5
This is great for a healthy lunch and very popular with office workers and tourists alike. It's self service and operates as followas. You choose your protein first. On the day we were there we had choice of seared tuna, salmon, chicken or striploin beef. Then you choose your base....a grain like say quinoa or rice. Next a hot veg, two salads, a dressing and a topping. Delicious...you should go
5
I love this place. It's pricey, but the "make your own" bowl is great. Some unusual flavours (apple kimchi) but very tasty.
4
+ fresh food
+ good tast
+ fast service
+ good location
+ many food to choose
- small place
- very noisy
- quite expensive
5
Delicious healthy food at an excellent price in a nice environment, it has different ways of cooking veggies that make them feel like a chat meal
4
For what it is it's pretty expensive but if you want to look after yourself and treat your body to some great tasting superfoods it's to be recommended. The ling queues at lunchtime speak to how good it is.
4
Loved the salad bowls. Fresh n flavourful food. Comes at a price though. The ambience is good. The service is friendly. My recommendation is The Tantrum salad bowl. Yum good! The Amaara at tanjong pagar has another branch too.
4
If you are looking for healthy foods in Singapore central business district, your options may be limited... here is Grain! Walk in "grain" and get your bowl in 5 easy stepsPositives* Fresh* Variety of product raw or cooked* Decent bowl size* staff smiles* locationChallenges:* Pricey* Queue is long at busy lunch hour (Popular given the location)* Eat inside does not offer you a calm lunch with a relax chat as the modus operandum is "busy"Bon appÃ©tit

I have been wanting to check out this place after following on instagram for some time. The photos looked appetising, and the ingredients used are very healthy. Pros:-Setup and layout of the eatery is very nice and industrial-like.-Varying choices of carb, protein, veg.-Employees are kind and helpful.Cons:-Each item, whether it be carb, protein, or veg, lacked flavour, even though they were cooked or prepared with sauce or marinade.-The dressing did not complement the bowl of food, and furthermore, it over complicated the taste of the whole bowl.My husband and I have tried various eateries similar to this, and overall, prefer them over Grain Traders. Perhaps we need to give it another try, and go for the pre-selected bowls or items on the menu instead of the 'make your own'

The scope of this review is for coffee only. Being a Melbourne coffee snob I have often suffered when I travel to SG and need of good coffee. Well suffer no more. Jewel, (the Barista) pulled coffee that could have easily have been served out of the best cafe's in Melbourne. Whether it was milked based or not, the standard was exceptional. She was happy to recommend a blend depending on what she was serving and delivered on each and every occasion. In summary, if you need great coffee in SG, this was my coffee place of choice
2
If you want a nice quiet peaceful breakfast in peaceful surroundings then give this a massive miss. Horrible over loud piped muzak combined with kitchen staff tinny radio blaring out means that any chance of starting your day in a reflective mood is lost. On food front why bother when your nerves are being jangled at every turn?Typical Singapore eatery where any chance of a conversation is lost due to owners insisting on inflicting their musical choices on you.Will never return.
4
Had breakfast with a friend. He had the salmon bagel which looked pretty ordinary and I had the rancheros which I found interesting and enjoyed. Would have been nice if it were a warm breakfast but it was probably a much healthier option than your usual breakfast. The coffee was decent.
3
Tried GT for the first time last week. I enjoyed the pulled pork salad box but thought that for $16 I may have received a bit nore. An alternative shop with similar setup nearby serves bigger portions for $14. Altho they do have a surcharge on some stuff, unlike GT.There were some good protein and veg choices; meaning I'll probably go back to try a few more combos, but only when I'm feeling flush
3
How come people have been able to produce healthy and yummy SALADS, but not for cooked food? The quality of the protein here is quite variable - a group of us thought that only the salmon was decent. Chicken, beef and pork were below average. Too pricey for the quality
4
Veggies in Singapore dont have the easiest of times - I was so happy to find this Grain Traders right next to my hotel. A bit confusing to order but that will be a first time "offense" only. Beyond happy to find kefir in various flavors and also energy balls (bought the espresso orange version). Set me back sgd 30 so not cheapest of "light dinners" / quick meals but overall happy with it.
4
Food is good as long as values aspired from food are clear in your mind. Appealing outlook, Taste, healthy meal , Quality, convenience and avoiding pungent smells, Cleanliness was aspired by undersigned. Enjoyed food and would revisit in future. Extra portion of avocado was a great treat. Ambience was great & place was clean. Decor was fantastic and everything is very carefully planned & elegantly executed. Service counter needs a bit of segregation in Hot & Cold section to avoid any extra droppings of unwanted food.Tick in all boxes and price is ok only if you dine once or twice a week otherwise it can be expensive. Worth a visit by anyone keen on healthy food and something away from traditional cuisine
4
Quite a lot of options and quick service. With 16 SGD for 1 bowl the price is on the higher side but the food is of good quality and tasty. Vegetarians need to be careful as some of the hot and cold veggies are not vegetarian. For example the charred corn is "Furikake" corn which means it contains fish flakes. Check with the staff first before ordering
4
For 18sgd, one gets a wide bowl of select grain combined with warm and cold foods (my favourite is seared tuna, char-grilled vegetables, sautÃ©ed mushrooms, fresh alfalfa sprouts), a small tub of dressing (beetroot feta yogurt and wasabi are good complements), a bottle of water and a cup of vegetable soup (the kale, spinach and broccoli was quite savoury)
2
I am not impressed with my lunch at the Grain Traders. The positive point was it was made from natural ingredients. I did not enjoy the beef hero bowl at all. The recommended salsa verde is actually more like chimichurri sauce, instead of typical Mexican salsa verde. It was bland. The beef was underseasoned and some pieces were a bit overcooked. Nothing on my plate was exceptional. For SGD16, I expected better quality.
5
It is refreshing to see a distinct restaurant layout in 100AM (next to Amara Hotel). That cooked food presented in pots and pans looked "yummy-licious". One downside - the ordering process could be a little confusing for the first timer. Anyhow, you will go for it again once you eat it. What I ordered;1) Soba with all the side dishes into a bowl. 2) Olive Rose Patel Muffin3) Coffee Latte (paired it with the muffin is all so correct) Overall Ambiance:Straightforward and spacious.Service level:Normal. Ok. The message above the counter on how to choose your meal can be confusing for first time visitor. Price/Value:Expensive.Will I go again?YES
4
I am a mixed rice lover. This is like a angmo version of mixed rice which is healthier , colorful, delicious and also pricey to me. I like the environment here especially you can standing outside with a long table without chair. Inside of the restaurant are abit oily and smokes are around the bar. The have nice coffee too. Try to avoid weekdays lunch hour if you hate crowds like me
5
The food here is so tasty and good! I come here once or twice every time I visit Singapore and have introduced friends and family members who all love it. 16$ gets you a grain bowl with 1 carb, 1 hot veg, 2 cold veg, 1 topping, 1 dressing plus a dessert and a bottle of water. The options are diverse, individually tasty and combined give you a delicious and nutritious meal. They also have a coffee bar that serves good coffee & nice baked goods :-) Highly recommended
4
good selection of food to eat. very healthy and tasty. portions are quite big but the only downside would be that it can be quite pricey for their lunch set
5
I can eat this every day. Pricy at SGD16 but totally worth it. Having breakfast first time, love bagels! It comes with scrambled eggs, herb cream cheese!
5
Didn't feel like trying their breakfast so got 2 cakes with my coffee and all were very delicious. Coffee is good quality and tastes very nice as well. Great combination.
5
Definitely one of the best vegetarian salad options in CBD - pricey but with a reason. The beetroot yoghurt dressing is a must.
4
Nice concept: healthy, tasty, fresh. Love the pulled pork and tuna
Cons: queuing and seating during lunch especially as it gets more and more famous
2
This places gives u an illusion that they sell healthy food. True that the grains (aside from soba drench in sauce) are healthy but the rest of the food items are super salty. The portions are small and its overcrowded. From what I observed, people go there more to be seen than to eat healthy foo
4
Been wanting to try Grain Trader after seeing them on a documentary on TV and seeing good reviews about it. Concept was interesting (each bowl is made up of 1grain, 1protein, 1hot veg, 2cold veg, 1topping and 1 sauce, for $16). It was a raining day when I went and was hoping there wasn't a crowded. The queue was fairly long, about 20 pax but it moved rather quickly -abt 10min wait - not taking into account I just happen queue behind someone who wanted to order 6bowls!! That caused quite a jam since each bowl was customised.Tried the slow roasted pork since it was recommended in one of the reviews - was kindly disappointed the 1servint given was really small- it just about filled one (Chinese) soup spoon, and although the serving bowl was full of juices, none of it was transferred to my takeaway box coz the staff was using tongs to pick the food. That doesn't do the meat and its juice any justice.I also tried the beet feta yogurt sauce as it was highly recommended. It was served in a little container. My bowl was very tasty indeed, especially the wild mushrooms. I'm not sure if it's because I ordered takeaway but the portion seemed on the smaller side (as compared to what I saw on TV, but it also seemed less compared to those who dined in).Am keen to try again, and will probably try the sous vide salmon
5
After all the eating in Singapore if you are looking for some healthy food, head over the Grain Traders. They serve veg and non veg food and you can mix and match your meals to create your own healthy bowl. Grain bowls are priced at S$16
5
Love the concept - feels like home in Australia. We had a steak bowl and a chicken bowl. Ingredients were tasty fresh and generous portion sizes. A bowl is $16 and you can add extras or make it a meal for $18. Will definitely return here
5
I can't remember the last time I gave a Singapore cafe or restaurant an excellent rating but this casual salad cafe in the CBD is worth it. While I had great salads or food like this in Sydney or even Shanghai, Grain Traders in my opinion stands out in Singapore. The selection of ingredients is very good, what I tried was fresh and tasted great.I went with my wife for late lunch around 3pm on a weekday (not open on weekends), which was nice as we avoided the lunch time crowds. The staff at the salad bar and cashier were friendly and talkative. Definitely will revisit
4
Great mix-n-mad salads and health food- choose one protein, 2/3 veggies, olive oil and 1/2 pickles and sauces- all this for SGD 15-18...a decent place to visit for a good light lunch or a quick bite/ working lunch!
4
A bit pricey, so not a regular lunch spot, but a nice treat once in a while. Like that the tables outside are standing.
4
I've been here few times. Love the pulled pork and having tried other meats. They've beef and roasted chicken that looks delicious too. Select 1 cold and 2 hot side dishes. Very good grilled veges. On the pricey side for $16.
4
A healthy place for office workers which normally it is hard to find. Nice selection of food and beverage and the cozy setting. Service is like any fast casual dining which is efficient but not warm.

For photos and more reviews, visit hungrybaker.coFinally got to try this healthy eatery during a spontaneous lunch meeting with a dear friend and I can’t wait to return again!The queue extended almost to the entrance when we arrived close to 1pm and there were tissues and work passes choping all available tables. I had no clue the eatery was very long or I might have not queued, but fortunately I continued waiting (: It is worth the wait if you have good company.Basically, Grain Traders sells delicious, healthy bowls with grains (there’s a salad option too), breakfast bowls, coffee and dessert. You can choose standard grain bowls, or pick your own (1 protein, 1 base, 1 hot side, 2 cold sides, 1 topping and 1 sauce) for $16. It may be a good idea to go with the provided options as there were more than a few dishes to choose from and they all looked so good!I decided to choose my own (salmon, bulgur wheat, green vegetables, marinated peppers, beansprouts salad, cashew nuts and miso caramel sauce on the side). The portion was not generous, except the base (perfect for carb loaders), but it ended up being filling. On the bright side, everything tasted healthy (not oily, for example), and the salmon was cooked perfectly, still a bit pink and raw inside, the way I like it. Sauce on the side is a good idea as, although the miso caramel sauce was really good, it was concentrated and even a dab packs a punch. You can choose to pay $2 more for a drink and snack, but we decided not to.While waiting in the snaking queue, we were next to the coffee counter for a long time and the gluten-free avocado brownie looked scrumptious and the coffee signboard (a different counter nearer the entrance) so inviting, we decided to have dessert and drinks. The avocado brownie was moist, but also rather sweet, so I highly doubt it’s healthy despite sounding so. It was good split in half. The long black was acceptable as it did not remind me of soya sauce, which the bad ones usually taste like.I would definitely return to try the many other possible combinations of ingredients. If only it opened on weekends as well
5
Great relatively new lunch spot in the city. Salad ingredients are fresh, tasty and don't have that "prepared in a central kitchen" feel and taste like most other salad places here. That is because they are not. Roosters Crow is my favourite. Definitely a few dollars more than other salad spots but ingredients far better. A wide range of ingredients to build your own salad. Very popular at lunch time so you may end up standing up at the bench tables outside if you get there any later than 11:45. Also have some sweet treats including 2 gluten free cakes. Highly recommend it
5
In a fairly unique combination of healthy eating, cool atmosphere and city location, this place checks the originality box fairly well. With a good range of not only healthy, but tasty options, make up your own, or choose from the short list of preset "Hero Bowls", it's a welcome change from the hawker market, or sandwich bars in the area.With ample, but snug seating inside, and some high tops outside, don't be put off by the long queue's at lunchtime, this is confirmation that their reputation is justified, but it was taking around 30 seconds per customer when I was there, so a queue of 20 is really around 10 mins, and very likely to be worth the wait. Many will be exploiting the takeaway option to redecorate their office space
5
Great quality -healthy. All they need to add to this is a NutriBullet for a healthy drink option! A lot if interest for a place that is just a month old. Love the way the salads are compiled - main, hot, 2 colds, nuts/sauce. Drinks could be better
5
Super-delicious place to go for lunch, individuals dishes are combined to make a super bowl of deliciousness! I have loved everything I have tried so far. A little pricey for an every day lunch, but soooooo worth it. Coffee is also great. Avoid 12pm - 2pm because there are major lines
3
I have nothing against this restaurant. The concept is simple: offer a choice of grains, add protein, toppings & sauce. Add a drink & you've got lunch. There's coffee & a selection of cakes too. My beef is with the rude clientele, young turks from the corporate world who believe the world owes them a big time. I'd get lunch either early or late but would give the place a wide berth during lunch as it's just too much of a production to eat here then.A word of advice: the sauces do make a world of difference. Skip the gloopy Asian inspired ones
