Must try the salted vegetable duck soup and braised duck rice..The lunch time queue can be pretty long and the braised duck was sold out by 1.30pm when I was there. Do arrive early to avoid the queue.

Even my 5 year old daughter who is picky on food likes their braised duck rice. The duck meat is very tender. My mum love their salted vegetable duck soup. Ask for some sauce for the rice. It's superb!
