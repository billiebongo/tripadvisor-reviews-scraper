The poh piah here tastes healthy. Light and clean tasting as they apparently only use vegetables and no meat save for a few morsels of crab stick looking pieces.

I love their popiahs. At $1.50 per roll, I find it a little on the expensive side, but it is totally worth it. I think I have eaten hundreds of their popiahs.

I've been coming to Singapore for seven years now. Unfortunately, popiah outlets seem to be slowly disappearing. Thankfully, Old Long House is still around. They have very fresh and tasty popiah, with just the right amount of crunch to it. I think they're the best on the island

One of the surest ways to get a group of Singaporeans going is to talk about food. If you ask 10 Singaporeans about the best laksa or the best chicken rice, chances are you'll get 20 opinions back and not one of them will agree with anyone else. I guess that's the way things are in a country where the national sport is eating.I first went to Singapore in 2010 and there were quite a few places that served popiah around the island. I just came back from another trip and was quite surprised that there were very few popiah establishments around. It appears that quite a few of the old-time hawkers have retired and sold their stalls, with the result being an influx of more traditional mainland Chinese food.The popiah skin at Old Long House is nice and thin, and the ingredients super fresh. I didn't try the dipping sauce that comes with it as I guess I'd be considered a popiah purist. A very good place to get popiah and a couple of the other stalls in the center are also quite good, including the stall that serves fishball noodles and the stall that serves desert (they have a great ice kajang there)
