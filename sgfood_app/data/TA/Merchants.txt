My wife and I came in for an early dinner as we had been here once before, the last time we were in Singapore.We were greeted graciously on our arrival.We arrived at 5pm no food until 6 but had a serving of the most beautiful herbed roasted nuts while we had some wine while waiting for dinner.We had the house happy hour wine that both of us enjoyed.We ordered a combination meat and cheese platter and an order of grilled calamari .The calamari was cooked perfectly with a lovely chick pea puree The meat and cheese platter was a big surprise with the high quality of meat and cheeses.When compared to whats available close by at I12 this platter was fresher and tastier than I have ever experienced at I12 or anywhere in the area. The background music was soft and pleasant.The wines at Merchants are small boutique Australian and New Zealand wines, all great wines at a fair price.If you love good food and good wine this is the place for you

Its not my first time I've visited the place, and have never been dissapointed !!The best homemade meal ever you can find in this Joo Chiat area, and my all time favorite is the Lamb Shank, Brussels sprout, hummus and the platters. Also excellent wines from Australia and NZ at a very affordable price. Ram are friendly, knowledgeable person who gave good advice on wine selection and able to suggest wines for my specific tastes. If you a wine lover check this small bar, Highly recommended

Mostly leaves, 18$, not impressed. Will be leaving the restaurant hungry and out of pocket. Very little response offered from the management.

Set up as a wine co-op come restaurant, fantastic outlet of Australian hidden champions of wine from small producers, staff friendly and very knowledgeable, if you don't like what they recommend they are usually fine to change it at no cost. Also a good selection of eats to pair with wine

Had a week in Singapore on business and this was a great little find. Initially was desperate for a nice glass of wine, without the price tag. Then discovered their great food. Much more authentic than downtown.
5
Happy Hour 2 for 1 wines $13. Nice food. $10-15 for finger foods. $18-25 for mains. Attentive service!
5
Second time in a week I came here to bring friends and family - great food - tantalising wine - and great service - will become a Favourite of mine.

Had a surprise birthday celebration held here and everything went perfect. Ambience is great and cozy, wide variety of wines to choose from, and service staff (Ram) was an awesome host! Will definitely be back :

Australian owned wine bar with an ecclectic wine menu - some very 'non-commercially known' wines.Its not cheap but not expensive by Sinagporean standards. It's relaxed and has indoor and outdoor dining/drinking options.The food menu is reasonably standard fare, nothing majorly exciting. Again not cheap but not ridiculously expensive. We had the combination cheese and charcuterie platter ($38) - good but I've had better.Wine by the glass is available and options are just reasonable. My friend was disappointed in the wine (she really knows her wine and is a wine officianado - very 'wine wise'). My chardonnay was great.Decor is in need of deciding what it needs to be. Crazy chandeliers that aren't in anyway design-connected to anything makes the place 'mish-mash' and confused. Greater thought and a re-design would greatly enhance the setting and the experience. As would a menu overhaul.Take away wine is available by the bottle. Service was efficient yet not super friendly. I suppose a job is a job.If you are willing to pay the price, visit. If not, there's better options

We have been to two of the Merchants bars a few times - the concept (Merchants acting as a co-operative which allows you to but direct from local wine makers) is a great one and we've had some lovely wines at very reasonable prices (by Singapore standards)! Sparkling shiraz is a new favourite!We went along to one of their events recently, which was a food tour at a hawker in Joo Chiat with a wine tasting and pairing. The idea is brilliant and the evening was great fun - would highly recommend

We've been to Merchants quite a few times for breakfast and have never been dissapointed. Interesting options that are always well cooked. Add some great coffee; friendly staff and wine (if u want it) you're onto a winner! The haloumi dish is excellent, easily the best haloumi we've had in SGP. There is also the option to add free flow bubbles for a very reasonable cost. I always take the option to add on bacon, why wouldn't you? :)The only way I'd improve it is with some cushions on the chairs, as they can get a little tough on the rear end..

Visited over the weekend and thoroughly enjoyed their selection of Australian and New Zealand wines, not to mention the great food too! Tasted a variety of sides from chorizo to pork sliders, chicken wings (which were awesome) and then some. Loved the lamb on a bed of mashed potago and ratatouille and the garlic butter prawns. The service was second to none, thanks to Aaron and Ram whose knowledge of the wines made the experience truly enjoyable

This was a perfect place for a group birthday celebration. Tucked back off busy Joo Chiat Rd. with large potted palms and plants to create a cool, calm and elegant atmosphere, Merchants Wine Cellar is the perfect place for any occasion. Great food and excellent wines from Australia and New Zealand at a very affordable price. We chose a set menu of finger food and there was more than enough to keep everyone satisfied. Ram, Xavier and Shay gave great service throughout the evening and Ram was very informative about the different wines to choose from. While we were on a set price for food, the drinks bill at the end was somewhat of a nightmare as only group billing is available. Individual billing or at least small group or couples billing, which is common in Singapore, would be appreciated by larger group bookings. Merchants is my new regular place to go

This is an amazing place for a night of drinks and conversation for a group of friends or a date. Ever since coming here in 2015 this is my usual place for drinks on a Friday night.Aaron and Ram are awesome in what they do. Friendly, knowledgeable, and always willing to go the extra mile for customers.However, as of of late the wine selection has been a rather anaemic for wines coming out of South Australia and Aaron and Ram look overworked. The place looks understaffed during peak hours compared to the Duxton outlet which makes it difficult to get service.The tap water tastes funky at this outlet and will benefit from a decent water filter or purification system. I wouldn't recommend the pizza if you know you what a real pizza is, the pizza is somewhere between a shoe and a muppet. They have oddly removed most of their signature dishes like the Bondi Burger, Beef Casserole and Lamb Rack. But do try the Eton Mess and Slow Braised Lamb ShankAll in all a place that deserves a visit if you are around Joo Chiat

This casual bistro ticks all the right boxes. An amazing selection of high quality Antipodean wines and by Singaporean standards the value is outstanding.The staff are friendly and professional. They have an intimate knowledge of the wines they stock and were able to suggest wines for my specific tastes. A tempting food menu too. Thanks for the experience - Highly recommended

The title says it all. Been many times and it's been consistently good. Keep up the good work Ram, Aaron and the kitchen guys

Love this neighbourhood spot! Perfect for a mid week catch up with friends over a bottle of great wine! The staff know their stuff and the food is high quality. Lovely atmosphere, especially at the outside tables.
5
The food was delicious, can't go wrong with Aussie meat. Wine was excellent. Friendly staff. Most warmly recommended!

This place carries wines from Australia and New Zealand, and they host a great variety of events like wine-tastings and meet the vintner sessions, as well as wine-pairing dinners. It's not the first time I've visited the place, and I really love that most of the staff are very friendly and they know their wines well. The seafood Aglio Olio was a hit, and their triple cream blue cheese on their cheese platter? PERFECT with a red (and even white wine).I would love to love this place, but sometimes, the service was a little on the harsh side. That said, they also offer discounts on their wines for takeaways, so if you're looking for a bottle to take to the party, head here to look for something of good value
5
This place is great. The staff are friendly and accommodating. They have great wine and it's reasonably priced but I was surprised at how good the food is. I have had the Lamb Shank, the ATM Salad and Creamy Pesto pasta so far and all have been outstanding. It's a more personal version of Wine Connection with better food in my opinion.I'll keep coming back
5
A very relaxed and friendly place. Our host, Ram, was a knowledgable person who gave good advice on the wine selection. Very good food and well priced to compliment a decent selection of wine that suited all tastes and wallets. Ask about the concept as this is a cooperative of small wine producers and an interesting story behind each grower. Well recommended.
5
Good homemade food freshly cooked, ample choice of Australian and some New Zealand wines, and very good coffee.Bondi burger best in Singapore, spicy meatballs, bottle of Blue Pyrenees Sauvignon Blanc, affogato, meal for two $100Worth returning for brunch, menu looks good

I chanced upon this lovely wine place when I was having dinner at Sin Heng Claypot Bak Koot Teh. An unpretentious and cosy wine place with great selection of Australian and New Zealand wines. Zac was very attentive and had a good chat with him, sharing his knowledge about the wines and his background, making the experience very personal. Thanks for having us
5
Ram and Zac at Joo Chiat run the place extremely well! They always make me feel welcomed and they know my name! Great selection of wines and homely food.Whether you are solo, on a date or even with a rowdy group of friends, come over to merchants joo chiat the evening will only get better! Wine the nectar of God's, only makes the world better! :

The place has a good selection of wines at reasonable prices. Food is also pretty good & nice setting. Shout out to Xavier for his friendly service & giving some very good recommendations...he really personalized the experience

We walk with our puppies over to Merchants Joo Chiat most Sundays for a proper sundowner sesh with good food and reliably good wine.Aaron and Ram are our regular merchants guys, and they provide excellent service from the heart (a real hard to find trait in Singapore). In fact, we notice that the staff from Merchants consistently provide great service regardless of the outlet, and we love places that remember their customers. Food wise, we enjoy the tapas style plates like duck rilette, meatballs, wings, sausage platters, and they even make a very decent plate of pasta (I am Very picky about pasta). Prices are very fair and the portions are generous.Since we've been frequenting merchants, we've constantly stocked our 160capacity wine fridge with their plonk and keep running out for some reason(i suspect a leaky fridge), so it's safe to say the plonks from merchants are delightful. The wine selection is plentiful, and prices are always affordable for good quality wines. Merchants does especially well at good value wines, and we often stock up on the quaffing wine range (we recommend Kies, Schwarz, Wicks, Olsen & Sorby Adams) as the quality for what you pay is second to none in Singapore.Highly recommend for couples and friends wanting to have a good time in a casual setting without spending in silly overpriced "trendy" wine bars, or even cosy business lunches
