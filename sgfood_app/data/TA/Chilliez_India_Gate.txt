Really delicious authentic food, best service I've had in my 3 years in Singapore. Great value for money, can't wait to come back. Don't miss it!

After almost two weeks of noodles I was desperate for something substantial and spicy.I was not disappointed. The mutton was so soft and juicy, the dhal was nice and garlicky, the breads were freshly made and the mango lhassis were some of the best I have tasted.The service was good and after luke warm South East Asian food it was a pleasant surprise to have piping hot food.Four dishes, four breads and four lhassis was just under $60. Well worth every penny or should I say every cent

I have been to this place many times whilst in Singapore, without a doubt some of the nicest Indian food I have had.The owner and the team are very friendly, they helped me get just what I liked the first time I went there and ever since when I walk in they know what I prefer- the Hyderabad chicken with a lime juice drink.Very nice food, no alcohol allowed but that's ok
