We were looking for laksa but bumped into this chicken curry stall. It was so good! I'd dump the whole sambal packet into it to sweat myself, but thats just personal preference.

I can visit this stall for my lunch fix any day of the week. One of the most tasty curry chicken bee hoon noodles I can find in the entire Singapore!
5
Arrived at stall on 8:57am and I was told to order and wait. Good that I get time to browse the wall of fame while waiting. All your waiting will be rewarded with a good bowl of delicious curry bee hoon mee that you must have as a foodie in Singapore. Please tag it on your list while hunting for food

We had a late breakfast/early lunch at Ah Heng today which is apparently the only Michelin reviewed place IN THE WORLD where you can get a meal for under $7. Itâ€™s in the Hong Lim food court in chinatown. We had the specialty dish of chicken curry bee hoon me and it was excellent. Two large portions for $13!!

The famous Ah Heng Curry Chicken Bee Hoon Mee has two stalls, one at Market St and the other one at Bk 269 B Queen St. The nearest MRT station is Bugis. Tucked away in a nondescript coffee shop in Queen St is a famous Ah Heng curry chicken bee hoon mee stall in Singapore.This stall opens at 11 am on weekdays and the queue is usually very long. You may have to wait up to 15 min for your bowl of curry chicken bee hoon or mee. Many office workers, salesgirls and worshippers from the nearby temples come here for their lunch. The bee hoon has tender chicken meat, tau pok, potatoes, fish cake and the gravy is thick and tasty. Each bowl costs from $4 to $6 depending on the size of bowl. This stall is as good as the one at Hong Lim Food Centre in Chinatown. The other famous stall here is the Hainanese chicken rice which also attracts a long queue of customers at lunch time. Service is good and you will always come back for more

My niece brought me there to eat curry chicken noodle, taste a little weak now compare to before many years back but still quite good has it basic.There are many good foods in hong lim, the char kuay theow, the laska yong tau who, the mince meat noodle, the ngoh hiang, the duck rice/kuay chap, the wanton noodle and the dessert store we had red bean soup and ice kacang was really really nice, we order all the above.Then I came across the dumpling store also queue must be good and is not cheap because dumpling festival is round the corner. Nonya dumpling $3.70, bak chang $3.70-4.20It crowded most popular food need to queue. Surprisingly most store operate on a sunday and so many people were eating out with family.Hope the eatery will be around for many more years. Really good hawker foods

I stumbled upon Ah Heng Curry Chicken Bee Hoon Mee by accident. It's located at the Hong Lim Food Complex at a corner unit, and you need to access by the walk up stairway. Most of us would miss it until you see its long queues. It's obviously a popular place based on the number of empty bowls, and its morning queue.The laksa is served piping hot, and it comes with a slice of fish paste, potatoes and two pieces of chicken. Price starts from SGD4.50 and service is fast and good.They could do a better job by clearing up the dirty tables and also the bowls. Otherwise, you will be tempted to go back for your weekly dose. Takeaways are also entertained. This laksa taste is different from the Katong Nyonya laska

This location at the Hong Lim Food Complex is always busy. Curry chicken noodles (in Bee Hoon Mee and mee is all they sell).It consists of tender pieces of chicken, bean curd puff, some sprouts etc in a curry broth and noodles of your choice. Come in different price range for different size. We had the 4.50 SGD (about US $3.15) version since we already ate so much.Broth has just the right amount of spiciness and sweetness. Chicken was tender, overall very satisfying. Good dish to warm yourself up in cold weather. During summer? Well, that's another story..

Recommended by Michelin Singapore guide. Can't get any better promotion than that. The line was unbelievable for a hawker food and as always, the lines never lie.Located in directly across the mercure hotel and the bugis+ shopping mall. Can't miss it just look for the line.The curry was amazingly quite light compare to how it looks. Sweet and tasty at the same time. The tofu and the Hainan chicken works well with the soup. I tried the bee hoon since it supposed to be the default option of the noodle. Plus the thin small texture of the bee hoon absorb the curry soups better than thick noodles.Oh, it might taste a bit spicy. Just a heads up if you're not into hot spicy stuff

This is an old time favourite for people who enjoy curry chicken noodles. The stall is located at the Hong Lim food centre at Chinatown. The curry is flavorful with taste of coconut, cooked in the good old traditional taste. The curry chicken is tender and tasty, served together with fish cake, tau pok, potato and bean sprouts. For the noodles that go with the curry, you may have mee hoon (thin rice noodle ) or mee (the yellow thick noodle). A good comfort curry noodle dish. The queue can be quite long and be prepared to wait. For take away order, the noodle is packed separately from the curry, so that the noodle will not be soggy when consumed later on. The noodle is reasonably priced at $4.50, $5.50 and $6.50 (Singapore dollars

Their curry chicken noodle is very good. Chicken is very tender and nice, curry is tasty although I hope it can be a little thicker. Recommended !!

I never fail to join the queue for Ah Heng Curry Chicken Bee Hoon Mee whenever I'm in Chinatown.
Delicious curry noodle with tasty tau pok, smooth fish cake, and succulent steamed chicken. Heavenly!
5
This is one of the place that I'll visit regularly although I have to walk all the way from raffles place. The curry gravy is not heavy and thus, goes well with the noodles or bee hoon. My comfort food!

Great lunch fix. Have been here several times and it never disappoints. Noodles are cooked al dente and the curry soup is surprising light even though there is a fair amount of coconut milk taste. Chicken is always moist and tender.

During the lunch time, the queue is rather long but as the serving is pretty fast, we don't hae to wait that long. The curry are thick enough, the chicken is fresh and tender, the fish cake and tau pau are very delicious and price range from $5.50 to $6.50

for local and tourist whom visit the nearby Kwan Imm Temple, this has got to be the next stop you visit. located just across the famous temple, lies this gem. already established back during the Japanese occupational days, this small and buzzing shop serves good, comfort curry chicken noodles. oh ya, the chili is the key here! i can eat easily 2 palettes of the chili along with 1 bowl.definately a must try when you are along this area. Queues are long and seats are limited, so do buffer sometime for table waiting and to get your bowl of gem

An impromptu visit on a Saturday night. There was a steady queue here even round about 8pm. I got my S$4.50 portion to go (there's a fair amount of good food at Hong Lim food centre but the place suffers from poor ventilation and lighting).This dish is described by some as Malaysian style curry laksa - it is usually sold by Chinese hawkers in Malaysia and the curry noodles are served with poached chicken (as opposed to poached prawns in the version usually sold by Malay hawkers in Singapore). While the dish was tasty as a whole, the chicken was tender and you get lots of thinly sliced tau pok (deep fried beancurd puffs), I thought the curry was a little too thin. It's more like a light curry soup than the thick coconut rich curry gravy served with the Malay version of this dish. It lacked punch but I can see why those who are less keen on a bowl of fiery curry noodles would prefer this version.

I come here at least once a week as it's quite close to my office, sometimes I'd have craving for it and would have it three times in a week. Chicken is quite tender, you may have a choose from three different type of noodles, served with rich curry soup. I like to add the spicy paste as well. Reasonable price, would go before 12pm to avoid long line up.

Let's go for lunch! Sick of the Golden Shoe we decided to venture a bit to Hong Lim early to beat the queue at Ah Heng's. Yummy yummy is all I can say. Well worth the longer walk and since we were early the queue was only 5 deep and we had a decent table. Highly recommend it. And it's true - can be very addictive.

This is one of the local favorite here in Singapore. There's a number of branches here in Singapore and I believe the main branch is the one at hock lim hawker centre.The curry is not too thick but flavorful enough and so, it can be drank like soup and it goes well with the bee hoon and mee. The chicken is very well cooked, tender and fresh!It's a must-try
