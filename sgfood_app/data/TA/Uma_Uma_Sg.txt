...simply surpassed our expectations when she saw the disappointment on my face when my upsized Chashiu Don came, and gave me a complimentary bowl of the same just to make up for my disappointment.
Uma Uma sets the standard for others to follow!!

Normal food they have. Price was average. I love this shop only because of their Yusheng Ramen where they served only during CNY period. I find that this dish is special and delicious.

Really great selection of premium spirits. Great drinking spot. Food is alright, just good for a fill, nothing over the top.

This ramen hails their beginning from Fukuoka, the umami version. The broth, like most ramen was thick and flavorful. One of the better ramen here in Singapore. Their gyoza was good! Bite size, small and cute. Tried the meatballs as well but not very impressive.

We went to several ramen locations from Suntec to Milenia walk to look for a dinner location that could accommodate a young child on that day.Finally settled here because they were kind to allow us to sit at a larger space for the child. It was also not too crowded when we arrived but crowds started coming after 7:30pm. I had the NDP special which was dried ramen with shrimp gravy, with a side of char siew bun, matcha ice cream & tea for $20. Quite a good deal. (I had 1 bowl of bad ramen at tsuta for $19.50)The noodles were good. But I found the sauce abit sweet. The char siew bun was nice, I ordered spicy but it's abit more spicy than I thought. Like Hay Bee Hiam. But was nice. Oh the whole, I was satisfied. My friend ordered the soy sauce based signature ramen. The soup was really nice. But the noodles are thin. I preferred the thick noodle which I had for the dry ramen. The staff were sufficiently attentive. On the whole a good meal. $46 for 2 persons. We had ordered additional topping for the ramen too. A filling meal. Might go back again if I'm around there and craving ramen!

The ramen, i liked that they had the dry version (with soup on the side) as well as the cold ones. It was rather tasty, and the portions were not overwhelming.The sides were yummy, don't miss the stingray fins! Great with beer or sake. I's suggest the extra plate of grilled charsiew, went nice with the ramen. Would not suggest the tamago roll, was not well done. It was a pleasant experience, very attentive service. Not the best ramen i've had, but it wasn't too bad either. Not too crowded on a sunday, which was nice.

It was late in the evening, we just want to find some thing to eat.Happened to go pass this place and decided to give it a try.We did not regard eating there .55SGD for 2 pax is not very expensive, but not cheap either.But its does provide good quality food, making this place of value.The Mazesoba Chasiu s yummy, the soup and the noodle blend well and is very pleasant to eat.This is a DRY version of the Ramen, unlike chinese dry noodle, it does not comes with soup. One has to purchase the Tokatsu soup for 1SGD.I will sure be back to try the rest of their offering

Uma Uma is located on the 2nd floor of Nihon Food Street, a quirkily decorated passageway on Millenia Walk lined by a stretch of Japanese-themed restaurants. Uma Uma was the first outlet we encountered on ascending from street level, with a simple menu that looked reasonably priced. On entry, there were only two wait crew who were reasonably busy. Interior seating consists of a long bar counter with stools on one side, and a limited number of small tables on the other glass-fronted side, facing Nihon Food street. I chose the Tonkotsu ramen, while my daughter had the Mentaiko ramen. We chose the one-bite gyoza, and to round off, I adventurously selected the black sesame icecream. My ramen was too salty for my taste, with less of the richness that I normally associate with a really good tonkotsu. The mentaiko came as a dry noodle option with a very large serving of fish roe, allegedly quite nice, but I didn't try it. The gyoza was cute and freshly fried, pleasant, but not outstanding. Finally, the black sesame ice cream was smooth and rich - just not to my taste. The bill came to over $60, which was possibly a bit higher than expected for an average meal. Service was reasonable, but the crew were a little busy

This place is in the Nihon collection of Japanese restaurants on the first floor, actually, of Millenia Walk. We both love Japanese food, but had never tried ramen, which is the specialty of this place. Oh boy, just wonderful! My husband had the soup version ; mine was the dry version, but so delicious! The edamame beans were simply divine, and the ice creams we tried, green tea, black sesame and lime and ginger were perfect. Service was very efficient and friendly. If we get back to Singapore, we will certainly return

We had ramen and the dashi omelette. The pork-and-fish dashi broth was quite intense and I would have preferred it watered down. The omelette was ok. Service was efficient and food served fast. I'm giving it 4 stars because of the 1-for-1 promotion which was good value.
