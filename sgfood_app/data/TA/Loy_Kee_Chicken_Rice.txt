have tried many chicken rice restaurant in Singapore. Loy Kee chicken rice and sauces are the best. Highly recommended üëç
4
The food was really good. We had a couple of their set meals which were really filling. The service was really good. The place had a nice vibe to it.
4
Eating chicken rice is a singapore passion and there is no better place then balestier road. Pleasant surroundings. Enough buzz. Simple pleasures. Heaven.
3
bought to-go and probably should have dined in as it wasn't very good. Place seemed clean and organized which is preferred over the chaos of hawker stalls.
3
There is one stall at main road of Balestier and one nearby in Whampoa market. The former costs more as it is air-conditioned, but the latter is more yummy and costs much lesser.
4
the restaurant is cozy, chicken rice is good but i think a little bit over price although not too expensive
5
We ordered dish below with 4 persons1)2 person meal set with steam and roasted chicken rice2) Fried bean curd small3) Wanton char siew noodle 4) Chicken porridge5)Hot mile x 2, Hot tea x 1Chicken rice was so juicy with dried rice feeling. It‚Äôs so nice taste.There are a lot of side dish‚Äôs compare to other famous chicken rice restaurants. So I suppose a lot of kinda person would sufficient to eat fish at here.Total price S$47.80 and it‚Äôs not necessary to pay service fee 10% even though room has air conditioner and it‚Äôs not self service as Hawkers. It‚Äôs more convenient for family without service charge!

First time to have lunch at Loy Kee Chicken Rice. I like the roasted better than the steamed chicken. I like the crispy pork too. The fried tofu just so so. The chicken rice very tasty and delicious with the condiments. Good and fast service too.
4
On a recent holiday to Singapore, Loy Kee was recommended to us for its chicken rice and it did not disappoint, especially when compared to another restaurant we tried earlier on Balestier Rd. The soup, greens, rice, sauces come together perfectly with the chicken. A simple and satisfying meal, which is well served at this restaurant
4
A friend suggested this place when she found out I was staying in the Balestier area in SG. So, after a good dip in the pool, my niece and I decided to walk over to try it out.It was just 600+ meters away and easy to find. The friendly manager suggested we try the set meal for 2 - and have the roasted and steamed Hainanese chicken - the soy version we can try on our next visit.The place is airy and pleasant, did not feel crowded although it was full when we came in.The chicken was heavenly! And the chicken rice tasted just as good. The fried tofu was so delicious - crisp on the outside and super soft inside. I tried barley juice for the first time. Didn't realize it can be refreshing and it was! This place is older than me. I hope to go back and still find it in the same spot!
4
On of oldest food spot at Balestier Road; there for decades and consistent delivering good quality as one day.
Chicken Rice just delicious..
5
This restaurant has an excellent chicken rice - one of the best I've ever tasted. The meal was well priced - $9 per person. Will definitely come back!
4
The one you should try while you visit Singapore. Good location, clean and good services. Fresh chicken and rice which are well seasoned. Soup is delicious.
4
We got takeaway white and soya sauce chicken rice. The white chicken rice was the best, very tender and the rice was very good. The soya sauce chicken was a little bit on the sweet side for me, but still good.
5
Since 2006 I have been coming here. Great food. Great chicken rice. Nice area on a main Rd so easy in and easy out.
4
Famous chicken rice rice at balestier food for not too expensive... 05 min away from shaw plaza..Will visit again ..
3
The chicken here is average. The rice is good but Chilli is below average.
Still can come and try if you are around here...
4
Best chicken rice in Singapore. I am big fan of this restaurant in Whampoa for years. Rice is well cooked and quality rice compared chicken rice you eat in Hawker centres in Singapore. Price is affordable. Chicken is cooked well and fresh. Must try restaurant.
5
This is the best chicken rice in all Singapore. If you are not used to chinese food you can try this, basically is steamed chicken accompained with rice and soup.
4
We were recommended to come here by our friends over other much more well known chicken rice restaurants in Singapore. In general we were not disappointed. Most chicken rice in Singapore are served in food courts or hawker centre where air conditioning is lacking. Here at Loy Kee you would be pampered with comfortable seating, air conditioning and great food. We ordered meal sets amongst our large group plus various a la carte dishes. Including and not limited to chicken rice, we also ordered soup, BBQ pork and the all so famous Singaporean barley drinks. There are two types of chicken served, one is roasted and the other one not. We ordered the non roasted one and felt that it was great with the sauce and the oil rice. Though price might be slightly higher than your food court counterparts, but I would definitely come back here again!
4
If you are looking for a good local chicken dish, then this is the place.
Their roast pork is also very yummy.
The prices are excellent too.
4
I live near by and get to smell the delicious flavours coming from the kitchen when I walk past in the day. So nice!
Have eaten here a few times too and it is always a tasty, value for money venue!
4
This made me believe Singapore have good chicken rice...
Like their roast chicken set and lamb soup is very tasty.
4
Chicken rice set at S$7 is good value for money. The chicken is moist and very tasty, the rice is just how I like it. Traditional, clean with good food
5
chicken a bit less.
watercress quite nice.
barley water nice.
vegetables good.
omolette good.
place clean and nice environment.

o The food was amazing, no doubt. I would rate them 4.2/5 if it wasn't for their service. - The chicken rice set with vege is about S$9-10 per person. x Utterly crappy service. I haven't been there for a long time since the first time they showed me their icky service attitude. i. My friend and I went there for a dinner and we ordered half a chicken for both steamed and roasted ones. We had plenty of drinks, and we ended up needing to take home the chicken. We raised our hand to get the attention of the waiter and waitresses. That night, the restaurant was not busy and they had several empty tables, and the waiter and waitresses evidently made eye contact with me yet remained oblivious to meet my request. Although frustrated, I was reluctant to use my voice to avoid being rude. I waited for at least 15 minutes before one of them decides to come. I guess they thought I would like the bill because the practice is to pay at the counter after your food consumption. They could have just tell me, "Sir, if you're looking for the bill, it is our practice to pay at the counter. Thank you for your understanding." That will suffice!! In the end, we got the container to take the food home and I concluded to myself that I'll never visit that place again.

Loy Kee Best Chicken Rice in Balestier Road traces its heritage all the way back to 1953!Today, the business is managed by the founder's son James Loy and daughter-in-law Jane. The friendly couple still work at the coffee shop, which is full of old-world charm with traditional marble-top tables and coffee shop chairs. A complete meal here should consist of steamed chicken, roasted pork belly, watercress and pork ribs soup, and a bowl (or two!) of fragrant chicken rice! This will be your best Hainanese chicken rice experience in Singapore
3
This is one of a handful of place where you can taste good Hainan Chicken rice in Singapore. The menu is simple and focus on Hainan Chicken Rice. You have a couple choices for chicken (plain or soy). Food is good and fresh. Its always busy, and you can certainly see it is a place that serves its neighbourhood. It is a family-run restaurant that operates many years so the place makes you feel you have gone back in time. The owner is presence there behind his "antique" wooden cashier counter.So the whole setting is quite indigenous and authentic. For me this is more interesting than other similar restaurants where lots of tourists go. The area around the Loy Kee is quite interesting for look-around as well which is a bonus if you have time.
4
There is chicken rice and there is chicken rice, but I reckon this must be one of the most delicious chicken rice anywhere in Asia.The family decided to go there after church one Saturday evening. As there was a long queue of people trying to into the restaurant, we decided to do a take away. We ordered 7 portion of rice, a whole chicken and one veggie dish. I found the rice to be fluffy and soft. The chicken was meaty and juicey and cooked just right. As any chicken rice lover knows, chilli ,ginger and black sauce are just as important as the rice and there was plenty of that, all contained in separate little packages.A delicious and wholesome meal for 6 at S$45 is very good value indeed
4
Been here a few times now, it's delicious chicken rice and great value for money. If you're looking for an authentic chicken rice experience, this is a must try. Between 6 of us we had a whole chicken, rice, veggies, a large pork, 4 beers and two soft drinks... 100 bucks! Perfect.
5
"Kampung" chicken feel. Plenty history on this place. Just have a chat with the friendly owners and their fam.
4
The name that always remind us of classic hainan chicken rice with choice of chicken meat or roasted pork. Loy Kee really focus on this menu since long time ago and answer your need for simple set menu for lunch
5
My family and I decided to have dinner here since it's near our hotel. We all had chicken rice and it was very tasty, the chicken was very tender, the rice was perfect and arguably the best I've tasted!
5
This shop that selling chicken rice is nice, the rice smell nice & the taste is ok. as for the price, around average price. 1 Packet cost about $3.80.
1
One of the worst chicken rice in Singapore. Really ex and I extremely small portion. I thought it was quite good when I last visited 10+ yrs ago.
5
After a quick browsing and seeing the rave recommendation of this place, we decided to go here straight from Changi Expo after the Singapore Air Show. The location is in Balestier road, quite easy to spot. We alighted at the Lavender MRT station and took a cab to go here. Restaurant is typical old chinese restaurant, with a touch of vintage. I really like the ambience as it is more local blend and not very modern like the ones we usually encounter at the malls.We were really famished at that time, so for the four of us, we ordered the family package (steamed chicken, rice and veggies, with the soup for four), with additional extra half chicken and extra one rice :) For side dishes, we ordered the boneless chicken feet and chicken gizzard (both the smallest portion) and the tofu. We ordered tea and 1 glass of iced milk tea for my child.Service was quick and the staff was friendly too. However, some of them did not speak English very well, so for easier ordering, just point to the menu directly :). Food is awesome, totally! Chicken is tasty and the side dishes also very good. Price is $28 for the family package, plus the additional, side dishes and the drinks, we paid $78 in total. Quite pricey but considering the portion (huge, huge portion) and the taste, it's a money well spent for me
1
Customers can't share food here. 2 sets of meals & 1 bowl of additional chicken rice (only the rice) were prohibited to be shared because 3 people were present. Unfriendly response by the waitress with additional UNPLEASANT comment of " Nevermind if we didn't eat there". Would such restaurant business survive?
4
We ordered friendly plate for 2 which includes - Roast chicken which skin was crispy and tasty. Meat was sweet and juicy. - Steam bok choy with oyter sauce which very good- Herbs steam rices x2 which full of aroma and perfectly cooked. - Chicken bone soup with onions, tomatoes and tofu which quite nice. For drinks : diet coke and hot Chinese tea was fine. The service was decent. They provided air conditioning seating and also outdoor seating as well.
4
My son is realy like the chiken rice and the soup, the chiken is so tender. The price is not to expensive for lunch and dinner, a simple menu make u easy to choose the food, they also have a pakcage for 2 and 3 people.
5
Rice is the most important thing for chicken rice. I love theirs perfectly, why? Juicy not too oily, not too dry, rice not too loose/scattered, not too sticky, perfectly done chicken rice. Love the Chicken, siu bak (roast pork), all time awesome + ginger gravy and chili gravy to go with. Perfect! This time I also tried their wanton noodle with roast pork, their noodle are very gentle, as in they are not too much of dark sauce but still tasteful, noodle are crunchy not overlooked. I personally don't like to eat overlooked noodle. But I also like more gravy wanton noodle sometimes, this is just plain but good. They never disappoint me, this is not my first time eating here, I used to work at balestier 5 years ago. I ate here very often back then. This time we are still happy to go back again
4
I ordered the chicken rice set and it tasty pretty good to me. It was fresh and flavourful. The only downside was that they don't have wifi which being a tourist and on my own was kind of annoying. A tasty dinner though.
5
This shop is the oldest chicken rice shop in Balestier Road. Those days it was with no air condition. Chicken is still as tender and flavourful. Rice is fragrant and Chilli is superb! Still my favourite chicken rice shop!
4
It's a wonderful little chicken rice stall that even the taxi driver approves.
The best part is really the rice itself. I can "snort" two bowls every time I'm there.
I bring all my tourist friends there.
3
Have my breakfast here and ordered wan tan Mee. Noodles was good but the wan tan is a bit disappointed. The fillings is so little and all I get are is the the wan tan skin.
4
This was a most welcome relaxing and delicious meal at the end of a long day. We just had the chicken rice sets which we enjoyed thoroughly. Will definitely return
4
Always having chicken rice here everytime visit Singapore.It's located a bit far from city centre, but it's worth the visit.One of the best chicken rice in town, loves the roasted one. It's slightly more expensive compare to hawker centre, but it has a good quality food and cozy ambience to dine in.Recommended
4
Having visited Singapore since 1971, obviously I have lost count on how many chicken rice dishes I have tried.Since 2012 my family have discovered this traditionally set up chicken rice restaurant only 5minutes away by foot from our regular hotel at Balestier Road.No need to describe extensively, their chicken rice is one of the best in Singapore. Many other dishes are recommended as well.The Chinese heritage surroundings only strengthen our pleasure every time we come back to this restaurant to have our family deli
4
After extensive research into where to get the best chicken rice in Singapore, we settled on Loy Kee in Balestier Road. Established in 1953, Loy Kee has been dishing up the famed Hainan chicken rice for more than sixty years to loyal fans. A bonus is that Loy Kee opens at 9.30am so it's perfect for a late breakfast or brunch.It is also a great option if you don't feel like eating at a Hawker's Centre with table service, menus and atmospheric surrounds.The menu features special sets with bok Choy, beautiful satiny chicken broth, 3 delicious sauces - ginger, light chilli and soy, the chicken rice itself and either poached or roast chicken. We chose to try both versions of chicken to taste the contrast and loved both.The poached chicken was the most silky and tender I have ever eaten and the chicken rice was perfectly cooked and flavoured with chickeny goodness. The roast chicken was also delicious but slightly drier than the poached version, with a layer of crispy roasted chicken skin adding texture.Accompanied with a big cup of chinese tea, this was one of the best meals we had on our quick but fun trip to Singapore
4
Nice Restaurant located at Balastier Rd. Tried the Chicken Rice menue with roasted chicken. Had a chinese tea and a Mineral water for less that $13. Food was tasty, but chicken was cold (probably aircon was too strong :-)). Staff was friendly.Worth giving it a try
5
As what my title mentioned; this restaurant which apparently exist since 1953 seriously exceeded my expectation in terms of the quality of food! I am a long time fan of another chicken rice provider who is Boon Tong Kee which located on the same Balestier Road,however on this particular day I just stumped upon this rustic looking corner shop that caught my eyes. From the ambiance, service and food - was all fantastic!!! The price was totally more than worth for what they serve. Hands down, this place win in terms of food quality compared to a long standing major restaurant like Boon Tong Kee. I was born and raised in KL and worked in North side of Msia. Saying that I was well exposed to some of the best Chicken Rice ranging from Teo Chew, Mandarin and Hakka style chicken rice all my life. This place definitely booked a new place in my savor memory as far as chicken rice is concern.From the fragrant and moist of rice, the tenderness of chicken meat and the flavor of bean sprout; ALL WERE PERFECT! Only the roasted pork was slightly hard due to the off hours from lunch timing that me and my wife went. They could also improve on their traditional chili paste condiment and add some original spice into it. I think this restaurant is a heaven for office folks that works in Balestier and Novena and I will definitely come back for more in future. One more, the rustic - old world charm inside the restaurant will make you travel through time and places for folks who appreciate the slower period/place in our life!Have a great meal guys

Arrived at around 6pm and was seated immediately. Ordered steam chicken and soya sauce chicken with rice. Chicken was a little dry and rice had some hard bits. Soya sauce chicken was very tasty though. Overall, the food quality did not justify its price.
4
If there was a rating button of 'good' that's what it deserved. Nice food all round, decent portions. Lime juice was refreshing. Overall worth a try.
3
Its to be had with the chillie sauce...only then one can enjoy..as its a bland dish...rice is cooked in the chicken flavor and adds to the delicacy of the dish.
1
A cup of Chinese tea , taste like water was charged $1.8 before tax. The tea bag was not include . The drinks menu was not serve too so customer must ask for the price before order.
5
We had been here twice just for chicken rice and dumpling soup.
they have 3 different dips and serving together with veggie if you order as a set.
The dumpling is awesome.
And you may try fried tofu, it's so good.
4
I often come here for a late lunch, at their Marina Square outlet. I like it that its nostalgic with their chilli and ginger serving pots, stone chairs and signs in the 'reception area'. It's quiet enough that you can hear your tastebuds explode in joy. They have a wide menu but my usual order is their chicken rice set. Some might say it's pricey but with todays costs and their location, I'd say it's a good deal.They are generous in portions; I love my chicken rice meat swimming in just enough sauce, vegetables not over boiled and still crunchy, fragrant rice and voluptuous dumplings.You have to stop yourself from gobbling down; it will leave you breathless from euphoria. It went straight to my soul and I could feel the devil laughing. No regrets would come back again and again
3
This restaurant is specialized in serving chicken rice set and more vegetable dishes. This quite similar with other chicken rice restaurants along the balestier rd. As for the price it is slightly expensive. A set of chicken rice will cost you $7 not including the GST. As for the place, it is pretty comfortable and the room has airco
3
$8 for a set of chicken rice composed of chicken, a small bowl of rice, tofu soup and some chinese stir-fried style kailan. I also tried the fried wanton. That was delish. They also serve sour sop drinks, bali, iced lemon tea as cheap as $1.50-2.0
3
In a town obsessed with Chicken Rice you have to walk the talk, and I'm not sure Loy Kee did that. For the price it was good, the menu detailed what was required for a good chicken rice, but they just didn't quite hit the mark. I did enjoy it and with a beer it was less than S$13 so who could complain. I'd go back, but no better than I've had in the open market at the back of China Town
5
I have passed by this place many times as I live close by and every time I would wonder why does it have "Best" in its name. After all, most reviews agree that Boon Tong Kee nearby has the best chicken rice. I always wanted to try the food but never did. However today was my lucky day.I luckily went in afternoon when crowds are slim so I found a table all to myself and I was attended to promptly. I ordered the special set which was on top of my head. The food came within 5 mins. I chose roasted chicken. The glasses was serve line juice (ordered separately) was quite peculiarly shaped like a bottle with a handle.....takes one back to old times (like those in movies since I haven't seen those old times).Everything on my platter was my favourite.....aromatic rice..... bowl of soup with veggies and tofu bits....roasted well done chicken....sauted bak choy with fried shallot sprinkling and sesame oil.....and three dips...one was chilli garlic onion....the other I can't recall and third was thick soy sauce with sesame oil. I love sesame oil and for me it was a riot of happiness.The food was fresh and tasted wonderful. I was quite happy that I decided to come here for lunch....and all in 10 bucks including lime juice is real value for money. I will definitely be coming back. A must try if you are on Balestier road
5
Love the food here! Best chicken rice and yummy seafood noodle! :-) Very friendly staff too. Great food selection and prices are affordable.
4
Visited the restaurant for a quick bite. Good food, reasonable prices and excellent service. Lot officials is always a good sign !
5
It is, as they claim, the best Chicken Rice and that too very reasonably priced. Nice, clean place which has a distinct character and feel. Its a must try food joint!

Having eaten Loy Kee Chicken Rice bought from various food court or hawker stalls since young, and rather liking the fragrant flavor, we decided to have dinner at one of their restaurant outlets. It is just a simply-furnished outlet with red tiled floors, glass doors and a long counter with chefs cooking in open concept, and marble-topped tables for the patrons. A very traditional style aka nostalgic style of dining a la the past coffee shops, except this one has air-conditioning.I had the Shredded Chicken Noodle (È∏°‰∏ùÈù¢) and I opted for You Ji aka oiled chicken (Ê≤πÈ∏°) because it was my favorite since young - crispy / springy noodles cooked in a light dark sauce. The chicken meat was tender and delicious. The set of pounded garlic-chilli, pounded ginger and dark sauce for dipping the chicken was fabulous, complementing the original flavor of the meat expertly.The Beau had the Loy Kee Special Set - comprising of roasted chicken, vegetables, rice and a soup. The braised egg was an additional order by the way. The chicken was succulent and the rice was aromatic with garlic + chicken broth's flavor. It was a well-balanced meal with meat and veggies, and we enjoyed this simple meal rather much - save for the fact that we remember the chicken rice used to be more flavorful / sapid in the past.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to check out:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/08/dinner-at-loy-kee-chicken-rice.htm

I don't often eat chicken rice here (I eat other choices), and I would say that there is a lot better chicken rice in Singapore. However, the price is pretty attractive.It is in a very convenient location. Some chicken rice stalls are either in the middle of nowhere with very poor transport connections (such as near Joo Chiat), or are really excellent locations but far too expensive (the Gallery at Mandarin Orchard - S$22 why would you pay that price?).This place is reasonably well located and offers decent food at a good price.Service can be a bit haphazard. If you get some of the new staff, it can be quite torturous, but the more experienced staff don't exactly welcome you, but are efficient
3
Used to be really good and i'm talking 10 years ago, went there a couple of weeks ago whilst travelling and found the eatery half-empty (not a good sign in Singapore). Pretty much over-rated now, very expensive compared to Boon Tong kee across the road ($16 vs. $26 for half a chicken) and Wee Nam Kee ($15) in nearby Novena. Yes we tried all of them in the space of 2 days. See the queue at Boon Tong kee, that tells you something.
4
Singapore has a lot of good quality, low cost eateries and this is another one of them. It is air conditioned and the staff are friendly and efficient. I chose the restaurant at random and selected the SGD7 chicken set - which was soup, roast chicken, rice, steamed broccoli and three different dipping sauces. The chicken was fresh and nicely cooked. It looks like there is a fair bit of variety on the menu, so there is probably something there for every palate
2
I came here after I went shopping. It was already late, around half past ten maybe. They never tell me they were closing, and they take our order. But in the midst of waiting for my chicken rice (which took quite a while), they are already busy and preparing to close. I asked the waiter if I can get "ta pau" but the waiter said it was okay to dine in. Well, later our chicken rice came and we ate. Not untill I finished half of my meal, they turned off the AC. Wow.. it felt very uncomfortable since the weather is quite humid. I talked to one of the staff, if they are closing, they should've told us so we can get take out. He said it's OK and he said to just take time to enjoy the meal. But really, it feels like we are told to quickly finish it and leave. It's disappointing
4
I have been to Loy Kee on several occasions and it never disappoints. The staff are very friendly and always managed to find a table for us even at very busy times (party of 5). The food is very good and very good value for money. The beef stew is delicious! Our 3 children loved the chicken rice set, chicken noodles and the char siew pork, the food isn't spicy at all which was great for them and the staff always asked if they needed a fork! Would definitely eat there again
4
I've been Singapore twice, I've always miss Loy Kee every time I left there. Travellers are familiar with boon tong kee, but only few people mentioned Loy Kee. Their chicken rice is great, I'm not a big fan of non coloured chicken, so I always have roast chicken instead, or you can mix! The roast chicken is still tender and juicy. Compare with Boon Tong Kee, Loy Kee is cheaper but with less choices, but everything is great. Last time I had chicken porridge, and pork rib soup, yummy. This time I had noodles with Pork Wonton and soup, nice as always. If you like something to drink, order lime juice or soursop juice, all home made I think, only s$1.5. great value, nice choice on balestier road
4
Absolutely fantastic food, don't expect a fancy restaurant, it's very humble but still clean. Chicken rice is amazing, as well as the rest of the food. A bit far from the center, better if you go with locals.
1
Bad experience here. We ordered half a chicken. The portion doesn't even look like it's half a chicken! It is so little. Ordinary tasting. Any hawker stall will easily beat this Loy Kee. Very expensive considering the portion.
3
The chicken is very tasty..but i thought it similar with the other chicken rice in other place..the most interesting thing is the set combination..try it if you were in this area..
3
Not the best tasting one out there but you won't go wrong with Loy Kee's offering. Reasonably priced too.
4
I was in the neighborhood of Balestier Road and spotted Loy Kee Chicken Rice restaurant. I always wanted to try their signature chicken rice dish but didn't have the chance until today.I was not disappointed!I order a simple set meal for 1 person, which came with a plate of chicken (you can order either steamed chicken or roasted chicken), a bowl of chicken rice, a bowl of chicken broth soup, a plate of green vegetables and condiments of sweet black sauce, chili sauce and grated ginger.I ordered the roasted chicken and it was soft and tender, which was a sign that it was freshly made. (if the chicken is dry, it was probably made earlier in the day before being served to you).The rice was full of fragrance and not oily at all. The soup was pleasant and the vegetables were also fresh. The key to chicken rice, a local everyday food, is its accompanying condiments and I like the chili sauce they used.I strongly recommend this place if you like chicken rice as much as I do
1
I had better chicken rice than this in Thomson Road. Firstly the chicken is bloody oily and fatty plus the fact that they also topped it up with sauces and extra sesame oil. I don't feel shiok eating cos I don't really have the chicken rice moment! AND the service is customer waving and have to wait for your extra bowl of rice because their serving of rice is meant for children I guess.If you are health conscious., don't
5
There are two Loy Kee at Balestier, go for the one in the Hawker Centre instead of the main street store....I generally prefer the on in the hawker centre as the serving is larger..... and chicken rice has traditionally been served at hawkers, so....The chicken is very tasty and tender. The chilli is fantastic, just the way I like it, not too thick, not too hot, well balanced.The rice is flavourful and not too oily
4
The chicken and rice here is great. The set comes on a tray with all of the usual: chicken, rice, broth and sauces - it also comes with a plate of greens cooked in a light soy.You can choose from the traditional, soy sauce or roasted chicken rice - we tried all three and each had great flavours in their own right.The set is $7SGD, which is slightly more than at hawker/food centres but the quality and cleanliness is higher. We also tried the home made fresh lemonade which was very refreshing
3
Was busy during lunch time. We came all the way for the chicken rice... yet I'm just not impressed with the chicken as it's not tender, even kind of rough for me. We were sitting in an inner room which is nearby the washroom. Looks like waitress there many from mainland China, can just speak Mandarin. Walls are full of asian celebrities, maybe it was famous before
4
This place has quite a history, as you can see from the newspaper articles that are framed and displayed there. It has a quaint vibe, which is nice for a place that serves traditional fare.The chicken rice is very fragrant and the chicken is tender without being too soft or mushy. It is one of my favourite places for chicken rice in Singapore. Service is prompt and fairly friendly unlike another famous chicken rice restaurant nearby where you are ignored when it gets busy and you have to almost beg to get an order in. Why put up with that when you have a more pleasant ambience and service here with food that does not pale in comparison? I will definitely return
