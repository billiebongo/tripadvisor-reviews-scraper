Dessert and cake shop on Ann Siang Hill. The offerings are Japanese inspired and infused into the menu, so not withstanding the Japanese Mousse Cake is its signature.

Our fave cake was the fromage melon cake! So light and fluffy, authentic japanese cake. Great flavor combination. Highly recommended

It was one of my favourite cake shop. I was sad to know that the shop's last day of operation will be 1 Jan 2017. I will miss it for light as air cakes. I visited the outlet on Friday. Although there was a number of cakes on display, but takeaway was not allowed unless for advance order. So I ordered some and a drink to dine in. Only cash and NETS is allowed here.Cheese Tart (S$9+)Very rich and creamy. Felt that the crust was a tab too hard.~Cassis Tart (S$8.8+)Inside was filled with black current paste and topped with white chocolate . Interestingly it tasted like plum.~Mont Blanc (S$9.80+)Chestnut paste with fresh creme on Almond Tart baseLooked like a hill of creme inside, but tasted wet and moist with alcoholic taste.~Warm Milk (S$2.80+)The drink was served in glass cup with lots of foams

Me and my girlfriend, who is my wife now went to their store an Ann SIang Hill before they move here. Totally love it at our first bite.. best we ever had. After 3-4 years we are with a baby now just recently visited the store. Well usually SIngaporean will say "Die die must go..!!" LOL.. Ok so we took a cab there while carrying stuff on our last day at Singapore. We will definitely comeback.. And last but not least, The owners are super friendly.. cheers.

Stone cold reception from the cashier was an interesting contrast to the bright, cheerful interior design of the cafe. Cake and drink were overpriced and underwhelming. If you like average food with pretentious names then this should not be a problem for you. Tables were very near so you could hear every single word of other people's conversation, regardless of your choosing

Crossover with craftholic - the reason of visiting. There was a queue, and many of the items on the menu were sold out, but they might be available when you finally got to the till to make your order. Maybe it's a way to manage the queue and expectation of guests. Anyway the food was surprisingly nice - was expecting more of the looks than the actual taste. But the main and desserts all tasted nice. The pancakes were exceptional

Had read tonnes of good review about this shop and wanted to try it so many times. Finally get a chance to go down, it is located within SOTA at the 2nd level. There is a signage by the staircase that direct people to go up. The setup of the cafe is very Japanese, simple and cozy. You must order first before they will give you a seat though, the cakes are all display beautifully inside a display glass cabinet. Different favor of the cake has different price tag and it start from $4.80 up to $6.80 per slice. We had order a strawberry, chocolate and a tea to go with it. The serving is fast and staff is friendly, they also came to our table to ask for the food standard as well. Though the cake is small, but it is not so sweet and it is delicious. After tasting the cake, the tea is smoothing and hot water is refillable in a very unique Japanese tea pot, the experience in this small Japanese cafe is enjoyable and highly recommended to try out its cake, will definitely go back to try on other favors as well

It is located in the middle of SOTA. Very small place with simple setup and a little of japanese touch.Beautiful cakes are being produced in that place. They do mousse cakes and cheese cakes depending in the season. The cakes there are really worth a try, it is really amazing. The price of $4.80 or more for a piece of cake, it is a really good value.

They serve variations of Japanese cheesecake here with other Japanese style desserts. At $4.80 a slice, the cheesecakes appear reasonable at first until you see how small and slim each slice is. Taste is ok- not too sweet, not too heavy, very Japanese. But no wow factor. Ok if you want something light, but not a place I'd instantly remember for its cheesecake

They specialised in Japanese style desserts that are really petite and pretty. This place used to be at Ann Siang Hill and had to close due to escalating rental. They are now located on the second floor of SOTA – School Of The Arts at Dhoby Ghaut. Little Red Riding Hood: $9.80. dark chocolate mousse with raspberry. The dessert was light and the raspberry provided a nice contrast to the chocolate mousse.  Nao Ta: $9.80. strawberry mousse with pistachio. A light as air dessert. Don’t feel the guilt after eating this. All in, nice desserts, but rather pricey for the small sized desserts. I spent $19.60
