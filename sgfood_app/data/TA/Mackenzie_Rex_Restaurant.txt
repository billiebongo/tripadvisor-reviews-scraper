I ordered Yang Zhou Fried Rice and it came quite fast. It was quite bland. Service was prompt and you are given an option to reject wet tissues. Ambience is not bad as it is near to many pubs around Prinsep Area.

It serves OK chicken rice, good ngoh hiang, excellent mixed vegetable, excellent vegetable soup and really sweet barley drink

After walking up and down Prinsep street, we finally settled on the Mackenzie Rex.The service was super quick and we were seated and order taken within 5 minutes.We ordered the chicken rice for two, extra rice and fried rice, and the Dry noodle with beef. We also had two tropical juices (canned) and a root beer. The total was $37.90, which we considered great value.The food was tasty and delicious, I especially loved the chicken

We ordered takeaway to our hotel via deliveroo and we could progress the status of our order online from order acceptance all the way to delivery.The food arrived within 30mins of ordering. The portions were generous and we got cutlery with it too.The dry chicken noodles were delicious as was the hor fun noodles in chicken gravy. Not spicy, very filling and satisfying.We also ordered hot and sour soup which actually is a mix of veg (and chicken i think) but the website doesnt say that... this was also really tasty.A general reminder for people: veg dishes in malaysia or singapore usually contain tofu. So if you have any intolerances, be aware of that.Would definitely order again

Another cozy little place at Prinsep st. Chinese owed but Islamic restaurant specializes in halal Chinese food. They were claimed top 10 chicken rice in Singapore, i feel its just slightly better than average. The morning glory dish was good, friend squid mini cakes was not bad too. Everything was fresh and served fast! They have full selection of seafood too which I shall try the next time. Overall good menu.

I always visit this place for its chicken rice. It serves chicken rice, friend rice, vegetables and some delicious side dishes. Try the chicken rice or chicken fried rice which is number 1 . The chili sauce is perfect with chicken rice or fried rice. Price also reasonable. Moreover it is Halal so safe for our moslem friends too.

It was recommended by one of my SGN's friends. The overall menu were "ok to amazing", but there is one which is significantly the most amazing and unforgettable dish, Char Kway Tiau Sotong (sorry for the misspelled). It's chinese Char Kway with sotong inside. I really recommend thia dish! 4thumbs up.

This is a small little restaurant tucked in a corner. From the appearance I didn't expect much but was pleasantly surprised at the selection and most importantly the quality of food.

Was invited by a family friend to eat here and found the food very tasty.All the dishes we ordered from poultry to seafood and veggies were very fresh and just loved it.Would give a overall rating of 8.5 out of town,,,,,,,,

I went a very long time ago . but i believe they still serve the best chicken rice. A good place for family dinner

Tasteless and a waste of a meal. Nice people but food well below par. Little atmosphere, waitress forgot dishes and food was gluggy. A few dishes were ok but not up to expectations.

One of my favorite eatery to try and get our meals. Simple dishes like seafood fried rice and chicken rice to try out. Very tasty as well .

One of the popular Singapore restaurant serving East Asian cuisine.Their speciality is Nasi Ayam (Chicken Rice). The rice is cooked in coconut milk, the chicken comes in two options: roasted or boiled. Unless you really familiar and like boiled chicken taste, always choose the roasted one. I also tried Cakwe with Sotong (fried battered squid meat) recommended by a friend, it's delicious.In Singapore hot weather, you will be tempted to take soft drink with ice after meal, but believe me, hot tea or coffee will be better for your body.Try to get here early before lunch or dinner time or you can't get any seat. Parking is a challenge as well. The location is at the end of a no through road. If you are not familiar with Singapore, I suggest you check the map and plan your journey in advanced

My wife and I went to Mackenzie Rex for lunch on Tuesday 3rd November 2015. Our reason was to have their steamed chicken rice that used to be their draw card in years gone by. When we ordered the steamed chicken rice that was advertised on their menu, the waiter told us that they could only serve the rice with fried chicken and not steamed chicken. We toyed with the idea of voting with our feet, when the waiter said that he would check with the kitchen as to when the steamed chicken would be available. He soon came back hurriedly to our table to say that steamed chicken was available. So we expectantly placed our order.When our order arrived, something seemed amiss. It was nowhere like the steamed chicken rice dish that we had enjoyed at this very same halal restaurant in 2008. There were hardly any greens, no garnish of coriander leaves, and the chilli-garlic-ginger sauce was missing. On the table was black soya sauce and some sort of mediocre standard chili sauce for us to help ourselves to. The taste of the rice was somewhat bland, lacking the oily chicken flavour that is the hallmark of proper chicken rice. The steamed chicken pieces were passable â€“ but nothing to write home about.Somehow, we felt short-changed and regretted wasting our time walking here all the way from our hotel in Orchard Road. Our verdict is that if one is looking for authentic chicken rice in the Hainanese style, then look elsewhere

Everytime I come to Singapore I will make sure I will make time to come and dine here. I LOVE their steamed chicken rice - their chilli sauce is a delicious condiment to go with it. The meals always hit the spot for me - have been recommending this place to other friends for yonks and am glad to note that they had not been dissapointed so far
