fish head bee hoon with xo in the soup, makes the soup even tastier.
if you don't like the fish head, you can choose fish meat instead.
but I suggest to try the fish head.

This is definitely one of the best Fish Head Beehoon in Singapore . It's hard to find them unless you are local.

We tried the fish soup with XO. We ordered the $22 size. The soup base was very good and sufficiently intense with the XO taste. We also order the garlic fried baby kailan but this was quite normal and small size costed $10. Overall quantity for both dishes were sufficient for 2adults and 2kids. The fish soup is recommended

This restaurant stands out among other stalls here in smith st. They serve pure local dishes without jacking up the prices unlike all the rest of the stalls outside of this restaurant that are purely there to entice tourist $.Must try are their fish soup vermicelli (fish meat bring Snake head fish or ikan toman in Malay)Others includes stir fry rice noodle with bean sprout and slice fish. A must try when you are here and do not want to be like a big fat carrot

Was at their branch in Chinatown. I will always try this restaurant's famous fish head bee hun, whenever I'm in Singapore. The taste and quality remains the same as I can recall from my previous visit. Another specialty for this restaurant is their prawn paste fried chicken wings. There are many similar fish head noodle restaurants in Singapore but I still prefers this chain

Most people like fish soup or fish head Bee hun but not all fish soup stores can provide delicious one.I just tried Holland Village fish head Bee hun at its China Town branch. The fish was fresh, the taste was good, you can try if you want.Enjoy!

I'm a fan of Fish Noodle Soup.. I will do my research and get to the places to try them no matter how far it is.There're few good choices to select for your soup base. I've tried milky, bitter gourd and tomato base. Love all three of them! But my recommendation would go for milky as I love the thickness and dense flavor in soup. Bitter gourd comes in second as this is something special. The mixture was so good that you can't taste the bitterness at all! Tomato base is another great choice if you still aren't compelled to trying bitter gourd.Recommendation: 1. Their home-made fish ball that is non-fried is superb! Ask to exchange with the friend ones that comes together in the fish noodle. 2. Fried Toufu is fantastic

After not visiting for some years we returned to Holland Village (although it's in Smith St, Chinatown) XO Fish Head Bee Hoon. We ordered sliced fish soup with a bowl of rice on the side. There is chili available if you so desire, we did, and it was great. The soup was delicious and light. Highly recommend you stop here. The aircon is a nice relief as well.

The location of the place is convenient, a 10 mins walk from Buona Vista MRT station. The food is tasty and priced reasonably. Didn't need to wait long for the food to arrive, within 30 mins even during peak hours and weekends. However, the boss of the store is pretty stuck-up and will often refuse to serve certain food in the menu, that is not of his convenience

Reasonable pricing and good food. It is always very crowded and I was lucky to get a seat for 3 on a Saturday afternoon. The fish slices XO fish bee hoon was so delicious. The prawn paste chicken, gou heong and prawns were fantastic. Have not tried the other outlet at Holland Village can't comment much. But in term of services I think Chinatown is better cause I had called Holland Village to make a reservation and the uncle who answered the phone was so rude .
