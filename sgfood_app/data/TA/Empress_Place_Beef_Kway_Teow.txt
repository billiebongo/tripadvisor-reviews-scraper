This is certainly not the ordinary beef noodle from the common food court in this little island. The soup is clear but taste beefy and sweet, unlike the rest which is dark and bland in taste.It's stated as teo chew style beef noodle. Take note that as of 1Apr2017, the coffee shop is under renovation, not sure till when

This is beef kway teow to die for. The kway teow smooth and silky. The soup rich in natural flavours. The beef slices tender. The beef balls bouncy and springy. Perfect formula by chef David who has been cooking fantastic beef lway teow at LTN 936 coffeeshop beside NTUC 24hrs outlet in Siglap

Seriously, it's the best, in Siglap. Perhaps cos nobody else sells beef kway teow of such standards and quality in Siglap.Kway teow is silky smooth, beef is soft and tender (depending which part of the cow you get), tendon is chewy but fresh, and the beef stomach well cleaned with no smell. The soup is fresh and beefy. Definitely not done with beef cubes. But the chilli is to die for. The chilli will burn, yet not lingering cos you'll be craving your next spoonful of beef and kway teow. A good meal that will fill. But the grand question to ask yourself... shall I have it wet or dry?Go on, choose your own adventure
