Great burgers. Nice staff with solid recommendations. American craft beers for under $10 and burgers are massive - not some photoshopped soggy bread roll with dry patties.

Tried their Magic Schroomz burger at their PasarBella Branch in Suntec City. Was here on a recommendation from a friend. So good! Juicy and flavourful. Enjoyed every bite of it. Will definitely be back for more!

Wow, what a huge juicy burger! Pickles, lettuce, tomatoes were good. We got the added bacon and fried egg. BUT, the bacon had a weird flavor. Would never get it on my burger in future again. Sweet potato fries were amazing! Def worth a shot

Been here several times. Burgers are always juicy and buns nicely toasted. Though burgers don't come with lettuce, tomatoes and mayo, they still tastes great. But some veges would have been nice. No complaints for the price though. Not the cheapest burger around, but not the priciest either

I tried this place recently with my husband, and, enjoyed it very much! It is in Suntec mall, and has a funky cool vibe to it. We had the Classic Wolf Burger and the Magic Shrooms Burger with eggs added to both. The burgers were juicy, rich and delicious. Slightly expensive, but good quality and definitely worth trying once

If you're going to die tomorrow, you must have Wolf burgers first. Their burgers are FANTASTIC. Juicy, tender, and lots of flavour. Quality is definitely what makes this a great joint for your burger fix. Funky, young, and energetic crew will entice you to eat more than you can handle... but fear not, there's milk shake to wash it all down. So if you're doing to die tomorrow, remember, this is where you must have your last meal.Best burgers

These guys produce the best burger & fries I have had in Singapore (to date).I order from their Suntec operation via Deliveroo way more often than I should.Unusual to be able to get burgers done to medium or medium rare around here and I personally much appreciate it.Also recommend their chicken burger which is uber crisp on the outside & juicy inside (they use thigh meat I think which is much superior to breast meat).Also their fries with squirty cheese, kimchi & sour cream are a seriously guilty pleasure (still kimchi's like vegetables innit?)Highly recommend

Good quality meat packed in burger at an appropriate price point. Ordered the famous wolf burger topped it with ham and egg and truffle fries on the side. It was really well made, dripping with juices and melted in mouth. Well located at the suntech city in the middle of the hustle and bustle. Must try !

This burger joint is located inside Suntec Pasarbella. Do try their mushroom truffle burger, simply juicy and delicious! They also have the Wolf burger with beef and cheese. Service is prompt and they will provide you with a beeper to alert you when your food is ready
