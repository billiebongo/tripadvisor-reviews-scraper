The dim sum is supposedly to be prepared fresh and it definitely live up to its name.
However I am a bite disappointed of the limited variety.
Nonetheless, excellent service and it was a good dining experience.

Went with friends who did the order. We just enjoyed the yummy food when it came. Almost every dish was yummy and we managed to enjoy a variety of dim sum dishes.

This dim sum shop sells delicious and variety of Dim Sum. It is value for money, worth the long queue, popular among the locals. Must try! Photo of $3.90 steam crystal prawn dumpling and $1.20 pot of tea.

Dim Sum Haus was a most happy accident for us! Our initial intent was to eat lunch at a well reviewed (not through Trip Advisor) hawker place in Little India. Instead, we opted for Dim Sum Haus after a quick Trip Advisor search. And happy we were! The restaurant is clean and bright, the staff is pleasant and efficient, and the kitchen, fast. The menus are expansive and well laid out, and most items have photos that are - as we soon discovered - perfect representations of the actual dish! Two favorites: shrimp in fried bean curd skin and steamed rice roll with char side pork. Really, really good

Little India isn't the first place that comes to your mind when you feel like a dimsum lunch. But if you do, this little restaurant at Jln Besar is easy to get to, just opposite the Jln Besar MRT station. If you are unsure what to order, you can't go wrong with the chef's recommendations. Eat until you drop for roughly $20 a person. If u have room for dessert, must try the baked crusty salted egg custard buns

The dimsum here is pretty good. And the prices are wallet friendly, certainly cheaper than most Chinese restaurants but the quality is there. When we arrived, the place was super noisy because of one very loud table (local Singaporeans) but when they left after 5 minutes, it was peaceful and quiet. All it took was one table of 6.... wow

We have been to this dim sum cafe for 6 visits and the food is consistently non oily, well prepared and not overly salty . Staff are friendly and helpful tho stretched esp when the place is packed usually during weekends. Good variety of selection of Dim sum tho The wanton skin cld be slightly thinner and softer and the juice from the xiao long pow can be improved to be more fragrant.

Enticed by the Fave voucher we visited for lunch today. We ordered so many dishes and when they arrived we thought we would not be able to eat them all - however they were so delicious we did! So no 1 favourite were the xiao long bao, no 2 the steamed crispy rice roll with shrimp and no 3 the baked salted egg custard bun. We had another 6 dishes - the only one I did. It rate was the carrot cake (had much better at tiong bahru hawker centre). We still o my managed to run up a bill of $48 and with our fave voucher (worth $60) we paid $36. Bargain. Nice staff too ...

We eat there yesterday night.We try few Dim Sim for the first time.First, we have a spider in our plate. Why? Is it supposed to be not clean ?Then, they forgot one order, of our Friend, while your order is written on a paper ! How is it possible to forget something in a written order?Furthermore, you HAVE to pay your napkin, even if you did not use it. Ok. What else? Pay the Glass? The fork?And to conclude, they add taxes on the final Price, and you have to pay more than 50$ to use your credit card, whereas it's written on the door that they take it (without saying the minimum amount)The food was good, but one (carrot cake) was not fresh AT all, and we can not eat it.It's also very expensive for what it is.Avoid this place, find another on

Decided to check this place out after seeing lots of people on instagram visiting and I'm very glad we checked it out.The menu has a good range of dim sum and some dessert and porridge items. We ordered a variety to try and everything either was very good or excellent. The best items were the crystal dumpling, skin was very good and the filling nice bouncy prawns, the xiao long bao were also very good although I like the soup a bit sweeter. The liu sha bao was the best I've had yet, the filling the perfect balance of sweet and salty and strong tasting with a crisp outside. The cheong fan was also so good, the prawns nice and bouncy and rolls just nice, not too soft with lots of sauce to be soaked up. Food came relatively fast although very staggered so never more than one item at a time when we visited for a late night dinner at around 10pm plus.Service was friendly and helpful and the interior was bright and clean. Very good overall, definitely want to go back to try more
