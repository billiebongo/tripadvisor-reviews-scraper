Good food and atmosphere here with decent service. Their marinated grilled duck is delicious. Another star highlight are their pancakes though my friends and I did not really enjoy the pollock pancakes as there were still some bones not properly removed from the fish. Do make a reservation if you intend to come here on a friday evening as it can get really crowded. A good way to see the authenticity of a korean restaurant outside of korea is the number of Korean expats who dine there. This place is pretty popular with the korean expat community here in Sg. Perhaps one thing I might not like about this place is the prices. I felt it was a tad slightly more expensive. But if you are the type who values quality and authenticity over price, this place is ideal

Being a huge Korean food lover, this place was a bit average. Easy to find seats on a Sunday evening, call button service and nice ambience.Between two we had the spicy roe hotpot and rice plus side dishes. The side dishes were okay but nothing fancy. Fish cakes a bit floury and we found the kimchi too sweet which was strange.The roe soup was huge for 2 people so grab others if you want to try other dishes! Loads of roe and cabbage and daikon in the soup. Again on the sweet side.Very full by the end and doggy bagged the leftovers for Monday night dinner. Will try the other Korean places on the same street next time

We ate during lunch time and it doesn't have any queue. We ordered bibimbap, doenjang soup, soft tofu, kimchi pancake. They serve 6 types of side dish but compared to the last visit, today is worse. The doenjang soup is especially little and only has 1 small prawn. It doesn't even have clam. Worst of all, you'll spend at least $20 for a so-so korean food. I don't recommend this restaurant anymore. Please find other place.

I went with my Korean Friend who recommended this place for its authenticity. Well if the Korean said so, it gotta be. The restaurant itself is pretty simple and casual with an air of nonchalance. Servers on the other hand, when called upon, were not at all nonchalant but quick to serve and efficient in ordering. Food wise, pretty authentic. No BBQ here so don't expect smoky charcoal BBQ meat here. Go for the army stew. This was cheap Korean scraps stew soup concocted during the American presence. It's flavourful and a tad bit spicy but really suit my palate. I also liked the seafood pancake and bulgogi. Rest of the food I didn't try. But overall not too bad. Not something that I would shout out loud about but decent fare

It is usually pretty full when we visit, and the fact that they opened till late night, but they seem like they never really seem to get our orders right. Pancake was missed out from our order, so we asked them to check on it. Ended up there were 2 charged on the bill, not sure what went wrong there, but bad impression indeed. Food was decent, but inconsistent. Not a Korean, so i won't be able to judge whether it's authentic. Flavours of the food are not bad otherwise

The Bu Dae Jji Gae (spicy sausage stew with noodles) is pretty good & enough for sharing between 4 persons. It's not too spicy nor hot. Liked the seafood pancake best. The marinated BBQ beef with self-wrapped lettuce was good if not for the bone which made eating a wee bit trying! Worth going back again for a good filling Korean meal. Pretty authentic and yummy

It was our first korean food experience in Singapore. The offerings at lunch are limited although there is a huge list of offerings for dinner.We had Bossam (beef based dish) which is an interesting dish. You pick up a beef slice , put in on a rocket salad leaf, add garlic slices and dip it in the sauce, before devouring it all. Nice dish and a nice learning experience.The other dish was bibimbap which is quite a poular dish amongst koreans and non koreans alike. The aircon could be better as it was a hot and humid day for lunch. Avg cost SGD 15 per dish
