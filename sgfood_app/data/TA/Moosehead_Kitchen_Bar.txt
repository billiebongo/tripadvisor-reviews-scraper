No complaints at this cost venue with skill fully prepared dishes some of which will leave you clearing the plates because it’s so good. Simply furnish and cosy
4
Moosehead is a place which I do go to for dinner quite frequently.
I really like the quality of the dishes - they are all small plates but the food is delectable.
Highly recommended!
5
The dates wrapped in bacon are a must-haves and so are the other mezzes. Great food in general but would be nice to have new menus every so often
4
Serves nice delicious food, but as the serving portions are rather small, so will need to order more dishes. Thus be prepared to a slightly costly meal. The small plates are much nicer than the desserts.
4
Went there with my friends and we were very pleased with the food. I especially like the dates wrapped with bacon. Staff were very friendly and helpful too.
4
beetroot wasnt as good as people said but their other mainstays delivered, from the broccolini to the cauliflower and amazing pull pork burger. chicken and reuben were unexpected stunners. it was very reasonably priced as well
4
Had a quick dinner at moosehead with spouse, ordered brocolli and cauliflower as well as the beef, grilled specially medium well and medium rare half and half as we had different preferences. Thanks to the very helpful wait staff, we had this arrangement. All in all a very pleasant dinner at moosehead
1
Worst service I've ever seen. I practically had to run after the staff just to order a beer. They were even looking me in the eye and then just walked past. Was there for over an hour and they never came to my table once to ask me if I wanted another drink or more food. Food was nice though but they need to brush up on their speed.
4
Even though we were in Chinatown, we were both craving a good-sized burger and fortunately found Moosehead Kitchen-Bar. Husband and I had beef burger and chicken burger with French fries. Very tasty. Owner (from Australia) took time to personally welcome us. Lunch price included 10% service charge and 7% GST, lunch total with Coke was S$52. We found prices in Singapore overall to be high. Restaurant located in a cozy, narrow old shophouse in the heart of Chinatown in Singapore. Lots of ambiance and good food

This was probably the 5th time I visited the restaurant. Food was great but there wasnâ€™t new dishes being introduced to the menu since the first time I visited the place early this year. Brought my Mediterranean friend there and his feedback was that the menu was standard Western cuisine with limited Mediterranean variety. That said, I always enjoy the standard of the food and appreciate the service rendered. Overall, I am satisfied with my experience. But I look forward to new varieties on the menu some day.
5
I was introduce to this place by a colleague and you have to try the beef flank. It's so juicy. I would recommend the roasted cauliflower which tasted amazing too.
5
moosehead is the best restaurant in Singapore. Quality food, great vibe and wonderful service. I need to go atleast once a month. Lunch or Dinner.
5
Friendly staff, great vibe, fantastic food. Go on your own or with friends and you'll have a ball...
5
I really enjoyed this place for the diversity of the food.
The taste and the quality are perfect.
The only flaw is maybe the quantity and the noise around when it's crowded.
5
food is one of the best, especially the brocollini and the cauliflower. Although beer selection is too few
3
In general, their food is ok but a bit overpriced. Ambience and service are also average. We ordered the hummus with pita, half roast chicken and pork belly. The hummus is nice but I hope they served more pita along with it.
4
Dinner with my girl friend and found mead at your restaurant and it was awesome!! Food was fantastic and we had a wonderful evening.
5
Moosehead is one of those places which at first glance look like a normal neighbourhood pub. A little place with tables close to each other. But these tables are not empty. Place is packed with smiling, happy people. And you soon understand why. Just when you think the food can’t get any better, the next dish arrives and leaves you speechless - soon you are hoping it never ends: tzatziki, bacon-wrapped chargrilled dates, beetroot, cauliflower, pumkin ravioli. I mean, really: the cooks in this place are artists: creating tastes impossible to describe
5
We have had dinner at Moosehead a couple of times and always found a delicious surprise on the menu. This time we had the artichokes (must have), the tuna tartare, and the torched cauliflower. The surprise was the baby barramundi with a delicious caper-tomato dressing. Service is efficient and friendly
4
It was a business lunch and we there three. We like the cauliflower in youghurt sauce (baked), althought it was a tad too hard. The bacon-wrapped grilled date was very good and highly recommended. The lamb burger was tasty but a little small while the pulled-pork burger was too sweet for us. Dessert - small selection, average.Place - easy to locate along Telok Ayer (walking distance from the circle line exit). Restaurant itself was a little cramp, and crowded during lunch on Friday.Service - Good good. But be prepared that the food is served very quickly and not paced out....and the table is too small to keep all the dishes...which means you must be quick. Or, perhaps we over-ordered?
5
It was so god damn good that I ordered one of the plates twice! Definitely going again to try the lamb that was sold out before I could get my hands on it!
4
Had lunch with a client here. Pleasant atmosphere. Had the quinoa salad with roast chicken which was good. My client had the mackerel which looked pretty good as well though a tad small. Shared the broccolini which was nice as well.
5
Food at Moosehead is always so delicious. We've taken many friends there over the last couple of years, and everyone loves the food.
4
Good food selection with just the right amount. Great service - staff was friendly and able to give good recommendations. Trendy ambiance - loved the decor and the cool vibe of the restaurant.
4
You have to try this gem! Small restaurant with massive flavours in everything we ordered. I would recommend this place to anyone.
3
The couldn't find our reservation, despite us pointing it on the page many times. The restaurant was hot, very little AC. That said, the food was quite good, as were the drinks. Good for a paleo diet, maybe - not a lot of carbs! :)
4
Had a Caesar salad to start which was ridiculously appetizing. Finished with a Beef burger Med-Rare but it was slightly over done, still absolutely delicious! Alcoholic beverages are decently priced.
5
This was our visit to Moosehead. Like in the first two visits the food was excellent, the combinations innovative and well balanced. Service was attentive and efficient. We just hope that they will be able to keep this level.
5
I went to this lovely restaurant on a friend’s recommendation. The food was absolutely delicious and many of the options were really good for my low fat diet too. The spicy tuna quinoa is a must try! I also loved the broccoli, hummus and beetroot salad. It wasn’t pricey at all for it’s quality. Can’t wait to visit again.
5
The service staff found out that it was my friend's bday and when I requested for the menu to order a dessert, they came out with a complimentary delicious cake and a candle on top. That completely caught us off guard! They were so sweet and thoughtful.The food was yummy and overall, it was such a lovely dinner. I would DEFINITELY go bac
3
The bacon wrapped dates are sublime and the roasted Cauliflower is refreshing and well executed. But the beef burger was ok. The beef patty is too dry. The humus is also normal and would hope that the flat bread gets more toasted/grilled!
4
The food at Moosehead is a pretty interesting mix of tapas food but the menu is limited and some house specials for the day runs out pretty quickly. The dishes are a little pricey but taste pretty good otherwise. Service is really great here too.
5
The food was really good and there was a niceness selection of savoury and slightly sweet items. I especially liked the bacon wrapped dates!! The service was great. The atmosphere was cosy and casual and it was just the perfect place to have a celebration!
4
restaurant is small and cramped, however food is good and fast service. limited choices of food. wide choices of beer and wines.
5
Unique food. Interesting starters that are great for sharing. Friendly staff. Ideally, air conditioning could be a future installment...
4
I have lunched at Moosehead at least three times last year. They didn't disappoint. Though a little cramp, the service is thoughtful enough to ensure that the small table for two suffice with systematic service of our orders. As it was last year, I can only say, it brought back fond memories and all things positive. Food, Service and Price. Do visit and give it a go - you'll leave smiling
5
All I can say is I love the small, cost feel of the place and the food is fantastic!! The roasted cauliflower had enough roasted flavour that brought out the nutty flavoring. The bacon wrapped dates were like candied bacon. Sweet and savory at the same time.I ordered the hamburger and it was good. What really impressed me was the Lamb Ragout pasta....I loved it! Would definitely visit this place again
5
Checked out this place on a visit in Singapore with a few local friends. We had a bunch of drinks and tried almost all of the items on the menu. The dishes are really tasty and great for sharing over a few nice cocktails. My favorites were bacon wrapped dates, the tuna tartare and the bone marrow. The drinks could have however been a bit stronger, although it's a phenomenon found all over the city. Would go agai
4
Is a long narrow restaurant, with a long bar/service area. Quite busy: best for small groups. Good beer on draft. Best to order several starter tapas to share and then do similar for the main courses. Dates wrapped in bacon and feta cheese deep fried were 2 good choices along with excellent prawns and duck. Overall a good informal atmosphere
5
I have visited this restaurant twice and love it so much! the dishes are very creative. I would love to try all dishes in teh menu. The only concern is that almost 1/3 of the dishes have cheese. There may be only limited choices for you if you are lactose intolerant. The food is good bute the restaurant is too small and noisy
5
Tapas here are outta this world. Fresh ingredients cooked to near perfection married with the right touch of sauces. Your tastebuds will be plesantly thankful.service is personal and warm. You really cant get better than this.
4
Small but comfortable. Interesting food. Feels like a little experiment in fusion maybe on the way to something bigger. Not quite sure on value for money but it was a quirky experience.
4
Food was great. The service crew was very pleasant and helpful especially explaining the menu. The ambiance of the place is quite okay but slightly dark probably the lighting.
5
Try to catch the happy hour (ends at 7 pm). We ordered 4 items and it was enough to fill as up for dinner, and left some space for dessert.
5
Awesome food and great service. Been here a number of time and pretty much tried everything on the menu and they are all delicious. Make sure you try the bacon wrapped dates and grilled cauliflower. The lamb rump is also amazing
5
Unassuming tapas place which puts a lot of attention to the ingredients they use in their food. Open kitchen concept so you can see hot chefs preparing your meal with pride.What the seven of us ordered: tuna tartare, burrata on beetroot, roasted cauliflower steak, lamb, chips, deepfried duck bun, asparagus (big love) ...What we like? All of the above! Food is delicious, service prompt. Comes to about 60 bucks per person including one cocktail (moosehead G&T!). Place is suitable for a big group, or couples. The ambience is more casual than romantic though. Nice place for a first date if you want to keep things casual ;)Will be back for sure
5
Dinner for two, which comprised a selection of smaller dishes which we shared. More substantial main dishes are available if you want a more traditional meal. The food was great: fantastic flavours, beautifully cooked and presented, and washed down with one from a good wine selection.Bone marrow on toast and dates wrapped in sweet smoky bacon are highlights.Recommend for all dining occasions where you don't mind being very near your dining neighbours
4
The sides dishes for sharing were novel and delicious. Being cheese lovers, we were pleased to find a variety of cheese-related dishes. Other restaurants tend to have only 1 or 2 standard cheese-type options. It was an enjoyable meal in a nice, small and cosy restaurant
5
Make sure you book a table as it's a small place and seems always busy which is a great sign. Sat near the chefs kitchen, although busy and full, still ambience allowed for conversation and very relaxed. We ordered several dishes to share amongst the 4 of us, would recommend the lamb and pork belly which were absolutely delicious.Great place to hang out
4
Meals were served relatively fast and the staff handled our requests fairly well, but the only negative experience was that they seated a group of 4 first, who came after us, despite our reservation. However they were quickly able to appease my displeased friend by giving us the alfresco seat which she wanted. No complains about the food, we especially enjoyed the pork belly and bacon wrapped dates. Although due to the cozy (small) size of the restaurant, and the tiny portion sizes, large groups of more than 4 wouldn't be recommended
5
Nice place, great and friendly staff, amazing food. Mediterranean dishes with a different twist are all a must-try. Deep fried artichoke with creamy ricotta, crispy feta and cauliflower are a divine experience. Thumbs up for their chocolate mousse.
5
this place is quite small BUT the food is delicious. We tried about 5-6 tapas and each one was great. Highly recommend
4
Ceasar salad is delicious but a bit pricey.
Fried artichoke is more oily than i expected.
Pita bread with hummus is nice.
5
Amazing food and ambience. The staff are extra attentive and the food is always perfect. No matter what, get the cauliflower
5
All is good! From the service to the quality of the dishes! Would highly recommend to give Moosehead a try if you haven't :)
5
Great variety and dishes. Staff area helpful and atmosphere is really nice. Always worth booking in advance since it is quite popular
4
Food was unexpectedly great! Love it! Service was good too. No air conditioning... but Will return. :)
5
Great food and service.. was hoping for more choice in chicken / fish as we dont eat red meat. yest some of the starters were delightful.
1
Visited based on reviews from TA as it was near our hotel and got great reviews on their burger. But alas the burger was no longer on the menu of this small tapas venue and the rest of the small menu had no appeal, so we left. Hope this helps
3
The food is good! Lots of tasty things, and everything we ordered was worth eating. Prices are high, though, so you really have to choose carefully to make sure your bill doesn't get totally out of control.It's LOUD. This was a Friday night, so perhaps exceptional, but we were next to a table of eight drunk Australians who were yelling at the top of their lungs and seemed completely oblivious to everyone else's comfort.
4
Consistent and fresh food. Although the kitchen ran out of their broccolini on this occasion. Tried the special: barramundi with kimchi salad which was fantastic!
4
The pulled pork burger is great! However, the place is small and can be rather noisy when it gets crowded. Do make reservation before going.
3
Happy hour was decent, but overall I felt it was an average experience. Nothing compels me to return, but I might come back again if someone wants to check it out.
4
Been here on a few occasions, and would certainly go again. They have reliably tasty food (if on the slightly pricier side for what it is) and there's a great atmosphere to the place and the staff are always great!
4
This is one of our favorite burger place. Came here for company lunch. Burger is straight forward and nice. The beef burger is made up of 180g patty. U know the palace is serious about burger when they ask u how u like the meat to be done. U can top up at additional cost for bacon and egg.Good place to come. But sure to make a reservation if u r coming during lunch hour. Good luck if u r driving here.
4
I love burgers and only some are truly great. Moosehead's beef is delicious, nicely seasoned and well cooked. The patty is a big small for a big appetite but just right for the average consumer. The buns were excellent, freshly baked and the right consistency to hold up against the meat but not so hard that it dominates. The only things that could have been better were that the cheese was either so thin or had completely melted that it wasn't an obvious presence on the burger and the bacon was burnt. All in all, the great patty, bun and service were enough to give me reason to go back again for a delicious meal
3
It's been a while since I have been to Moosehead. Food had always been good with previous visits. Admittedly it has been a year since my last visit.Food was a slight disappointment during my most recent dining experience.The menu read well and probably led to high expectations.The fried feta was great as was the duck. However, the pork belly and charred broccolini did not meet expectations and the flavours left my tastebuds confused.Service was good despite a busy night in the restaurant
3
Waiters are friendly however not attentive enough. Did not refill our water from time to time. Missed out order causing delay.Although compensate with side dish, felt they should be more attentive. Food serve was on the cold side not warm enough. Music was too loud and place was too dim. More suitable for chill out than dining
5
We called in for dinner yesterday evening. Wow! Amazing food! We had 4 dishes in total. Our favourites were the dates wrapped in bacon with aioli & pine nuts and cauliflower served in aioli with caramelised onions. Triple cooked chips were also delicious. Excellent service despite the restaurant being very busy. Great advice on which dishes to choose and our water was constantly topped up. Alcohol was a little on the expensive side but overall a fantastic meal! Wish we lived nearer to visit again.
3
Took my wife for a meal last Friday night, after having an impressive meal there with my kids 12 months earlier. We ordered flatbread and dip and carrots to share and my wife ordered a roast chicken for main, and I had the pork belly and both had a glass of wine to drink. Can't fault food, ambiance and service however the price of wine was something else - $22 for a glass of South Australian shiraz. Come on guys, I know the price of wine is expensive in Singapore but this is rediculous. Worked out we can buy a full bottle in Australia for about $16-$17. Really does spoil a good evening
4
Unpretentious space with honest food. I just wish the have bigger size options for the sandwich. I could easily eat a bigger one...
4
Very good food. Portions a bit small, but priced accordingly. Service is excellent. Definitely need to reserve a table if you want to eat before 9 pm. We'll be back.
5
Took some more friends to Moosehead while they were in Singapore. Glad a few of the regular items are still on the menu. The new items were yummy also. Triple cooked chips were amazing.
4
Atmospheric and quirky! Tasty and diverse food. I particularly liked the prunes in bacon and the iconic roasted cauliflower.
4
This is a nice place that is a bit difficult to find. Had a 3 course menu from the a la carte and all dishes were really great.
3
I really really wanted to love the place. But only 1 dish out of 5 popped and its not cheap either.
Cauliflower was the standout dish, Almond cake was nice very and moist. All the others not so memorable.
3
Heard of all the raves about this place so was excited to dine there. Booking on sat night 7.30pm - wasn't very crowded yet. As soon as we sat down was informed that there was no pork left from the menu. Less than 5 minutes later when ready to order was told by waiter that there wasn't any lamb left from the menu. So basically for meat other than dish, you either has flat iron steak ... Of flat iron steak !!! Poor show & disappointing. Some of the starters were good but 3 out of 4 of us at the table had to order the steak left little enthusiasm for the night. Would we go again ... Not likely ... There's just too many new/good restaurants around to spend my money on a disappointing meal
4
The most important thing first: The food was excellent and the wine was also very good. We enjoyed the meals very much and I would definitely recommend the food and wine here. Service was also fast and friendly.But... As others said, the portions are really really small. We were aware of this before our visit, but were still disappointed. Also, even for Singaporean standards the prices are very steep.Overall, a good experience but we would probably not return due to the prices and small portions
5
I really enjoyed the food in this restaurant. We have tried fried feta with honey, lamb, honey glazed carrots, figs dessert. Food was served in small portions however it was just right. The restaurant is little too small for the amount of the tables. It was loud and almost no privacy as the next table is very near to you. I will definitely visit again
5
Tucked along a row of shop houses along Telok Ayer road, Moosehead is a small but quaint restaurant that serves delicious and quality dishes. My family of three ordered the starters of Feta cheese cube, Humus with arabic bread and for the main, we had Beef Cheeks, Beef Ribs and Lamb shoulder..all of them super tender and delicious! The servings not large but that is made up by the high quality and attention to details. I saw an extensive cocktails list but did not order any alcohol
5
The food is sooooo good. Loved the cauliflower and the beef cheek that was so soft and tender and flavourful! The grilled broccoli was nicely charred too!
4
Something different than normal dishes and nice. Special thought has been given to make the food different and taste good.
4
Visited the place on a weekday. Loved the food and the fact that the fare was different from most of the places. Innovative combinations, which tickled the tastebuds. Extra items on the chalkboard are nice as well.
5
Awesome food, friendly staff. Cozy atmosphere, a tad congested though. Food is on par or better than some of the more expensive restaurants in the neighborhood. We tasted all the starters and they were simply outstanding. Fish was super succulent.
5
I think you the possibility making mistakes on food ordering is low. All the dishes i ordered are impressive.i can feel the passion of the chef through the food! Yummmm!
5
Took some friends to Moosehead. They loved the food. So tasty! Moosehead never disappoints. The food is always delicious. And the wine is really reasonably priced.
4
Went there with family and tried different dishes like burgers, salad and meal of the day everything was good, fresh and tasty! Good price and VALUE
5
Forget about all these fancy star restaurants all around marina bay. If you want a decent priced, excellent food and perfect service, come on over and enjoy the great food at moosehead. This place seems very popular amongst locals and business folks. Big thanks to our adorable servant Sue and the kitchen! You guys were awesome!
4
We went there when we stopped in Singapore for one night and really enjoyed the food. We chose several starters and they all were tasting very nice. You can tell that they are prepared with thought, a sense for quality and ingredients... the main was also good although not as good as I expected after really enjoying the starters. The wine also was good as well as the service and atmosphere
4
Tasty food from classic, eclectic, refreshed or reinterpreted ingredients. Few choices in the menus, but rather exquisite. Very small place, a bit too crowded and under pressure to rotate tables as quickly and many as possible. Not very suited for romantic dinners. Expensive, perfectible, tasty food.
4
Such a cozy place with great food to accompany it! Loved the sea bass....gorgeous flavours. The pig's ears had a delightful dip that made it stand out. The mash flavoured with bone marrow was perfect though sinful! Will definitely be back!
5
You can't go wrong.. meat, vege, drinks. All Good! So much fun for sharing so one can try many many dishes. Super Yum!
Definitely will return and Highly recommend going!
4
Great food on small dainty setting but a bit too noisy for conversation and slightly on the warm side
5
Fabulous restaurant quality food and excellent service. Gluten free status also taken into consideration. Decent wine list and not too over the top price wise. Enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.
5
We have visited the restaurant twice in 2 weeks and will be back again! It's an awesome experience. We tried everything from sea bass to pulled pork to the beef cheek and nothing disappointed! Really cool atmosphere, service was top class and even the owner was serving tables
5
There maybe several restaurants in Singapore that serves good food, but what makes Moosehead a cut above the rest is it's delicious yet unpredictable fusion.I've tried most of their dishes, and needless to say, every dish was outstanding, delicious and exciting. I would always order the cauliflower, beetroot salad, crunchy feta, pig's ears and bone marrow. The taste and texture of these dishes are crisp and of good qualitY. Not to mention, the chocolate mousse dessert is also to die for! I would always recommend Moosehead to my friends, colleagues, etc. Apart from its dishes, the resto has a very chill and friendly atmosphere. They've got an awesome Chef who would sometimes serve our food order. Kudos to Chef and his wonders!!
5
A buzzing place with a great vibe. The menu is small but really well executed. The artichoke starter is always a hit. The desserts are great. Fresh flavours, interesting menu. A firm favourite with us. Wish they would revamp the menu often and also include a few more veggie and fish options. Recommend this place
4
So this is a very narrow place and our tables are right next to other people's tables. Do NOT expect any privacy here. Could hear everyone's conversations. Food was average - the fried artichoke dish was good. Everything else was exactly the same as you would find in a lot of hip restaurants in Singapore. Music definitely added to spunk of place. Service was excellent.
4
The food choices makes it easy to pick your menu and the portions were enough for a couple to share. The space is pretty tight but could be a good tick if the other diners are friendly & intimate. Overall prices were abit average compared to similar cuisines & restaurants. It was a $$ for us without the dessert.
4
Got into this restaurant for dinner. We ordered flat bread with seasalt olive oil, chargrilled dates, beef tartare, braised beef cheeks& chargrilled brocollini. Like the beef tartare the most. Good red wine where we got pinor noir. Too full that we couldn't get our dessert. Good recommendation for sharing for 2 persons.
5
Great place to catch up with friends! Love the bacon wrapped dates and roasted cauliflower, will definitely come back again!
5
Never been disappointed with the food at Moosehead. Had a friend visiting who is vegetarian and she loved it. Service was also good.
5
Had a sensational meal! The food is exiting and keep your taste buds in high anticipation. Great Service! Compliments to the Head Chef Seumas Smith and staff. A must when you are in Singapore.
5
Love the casual vibe and the amazingly tasty food. Drinks were brilliant and the service was excellent. The burger was so good but the cauliflower... What the hell? How does it taste so good? An awesome meal and somewhere I would suggest going with friends.
4
Came here today for lunch on the recommendation of a friend. I opted for the beef burger whilst my friend opted for the pulled pork. Both were quite tasty. Service was efficient and friendly. Good atmosphere. $22 for a burger is perhaps a little expensive at lunch, but I guess that's pretty standard in Singapore these days
4
Dishes I would reorder: Califlower, Bacon Wrap DatesDishes I would not recommend: Mash potato (felt like instant potatoes, and I very much wanted to ask the waiter if they used the instant powder but my friends felt it might be offensive so I didn't, but I believe it is instant because the texture and taste was just off). Vibes were pretty good at this place, laid back and chillax. Presentation of dishes were nice as well. Prices were very much like a regular tapas bar restaurant
5
I have been here a few times and will definitely come back. Seumas the Chef provide a delightful culinary experience. I really enjoy the bone marrow, the lamb, beetroot and the cauliflower. Simply delicious with a bottle of red to go with the meal. The relaxed ambience and music is just perfect for a relaxed dinner experience with outstanding eats. It is hard to stop at just a few dishes. Must go back and continue to explore the menu
4
Really liked this place. Cosy and very laid back with eclectic furniture and menu. Tried pork scratchings, beef tartar and yuzu mayo and bacon-wrapped chargrilled dates with aioli and pine nuts as two starters. Both very good. Braised beef tongue and crispy spiced pig's ears also looked interesting (for another visit). Mains were pan seared sea bass with eggplant caviar and anchovy butter and the braised beef cheek. Both were excellent. Washed the food down with a Tempranillo with 15% Mazuelo (Carignan) wine from Rioja which was also good. Usual rather excessive Singapore price at S$84 a bottle (but same as elsewhere). Food was good value. Could go back and explore the menu further and like the easy ambience and music choice. Book ahead as limited seating
5
Dined at Moosehead a couple of times in the recent months and every visit is just as authentic! Everything I've ever ordered here is always tastefully done, it's hard not to order everything on the menu(almost always the case). Particularly love the burrata, cauliflower and bone marrow. Looking forward to my monthly dinners here
5
Had a sensational lunch experience here. The food was exciting, different and tasty. Service was really really good. If you go there you must try the cauliflower, i am not joking when i say its the best i have ever had. Really you cannot go wrong ordering anything on their menu. Look forward to returning soon!
5
ever so often, you find a little place that serves fantastic food, is small enough to be intimate, but big enough to do it professionally. Everyone smiles, and eats.
I had the seabass with quinoa - and its sensational.
4
Good original food. Modestly priced for a hip Singapore eatery (including the wine). Bacon wrapped dates and beef cheek were enjoyable. Friendly and professional service. Will be going back.
5
Awesome little restaurant, cool vibes, great sharing plates. Had to order a second helping of the bacon wrapped dates!! $400 for 4 people including 2 bottles of wine. Will be back for sure!!
4
Loved the food, we shared plates and everything was delicious! No air con though, so it was quite hot, but the place had a nice relaxed vibe and very attentive staff.
5
Love everything from the salad to the beef cheeks, *the meat melts in your mouth! The resto is very small so you're seated quite close to next table. The staff were very accommodating and made us feel like super stars.
4
great food, great venue, and nice staff. only gripe was that the music was too loud for lunchtime chatting, but they turned it down when we asked so can't really complain - defn go back.
4
Recommended by a friend, this is a great find, with some interesting dishes. Definitely recommend the Pig's Ears, even if it sounds less than palatable. Finished in a cajun style coating and served with aioli, this was definitely my favourite dish of the night. The crunchy feta is also very good. My only complaint was that the salami plate looked like something pulled out of a supermarket salami package. Tasted fine, but wasn't as good as the rest of the food was
4
nice place for lunch with good burgers on the menu.the diner is also nice but only if you are happy to share meals platters.issue is the menu is a bit of the same so limits the appetite to come back once you've done it once or twic
4
Love the ambience and the style of the restaurant. Attentive staff.Like the food there, everything was okay. All the other dishes was good except the pork belly was a little disappointed, quite dry. Not the typical pork belly where they serve with a little fats. Their desserts menu was quite limited and small portion.For the restaurant, No aircon, could be abit hot for the weather in Singapore. A little bit small, so if eating in big group, please make sure there is booking.Their reservation has time limit as well probably due to small space
4
The food was delicious, tenderly cooked European food to make you salivate. I especially enjoyed he bacon and date mixture which was superb. The baked cauliflower made vegetables taste superb and very moorish. The only thing I would say is that after a meal you are still hungry. You need at least 2 sides to make he meal filling, which can be rather pricy.
5
just renovated recently spanking new old look. food is always awesome and consistent with new tapas dishes. really enjoyed the grass fed wagyu in the charcoal oven. another awesome night.
5
Took our visitor from Italy to Moosehead. He loved the food, as do we always. Also the wine is priced well, so your happy to buy that second bottle.
5
I visited Moosehead at the end of January with a group of friends. It's a small-plates restaurant, so we were originally concerned about whether the dishes would be substantial enough. Thankfully they were; we especially liked the bacon-wrapped dates and the roast cauliflower.
5
Our 3 rd visit to Moosehead didn't disappoint. Delicious food for sharing and wine at good prices. We we will be back again soon.
5
There is no restaurant quiet like Moosehead. What an absolute delight to dine their, the food, ambiance and the wonderful friendly staff. Thank you

The food was inventive, interesting and expertly prepared. Each dish was a winner. The wine list was spot on. We had a red and a white and both were well priced and delicious. Moosehead is a favourite, relaxed eatery. Just the way we like to eat these days. Keep up the good work boys and girls
5
We went on a Friday night and it was a perfect Friday night occasion - lots of lovely dishes (the waitress tried to discourage us from ordering so much which was rather endearing, as was her amazement when we ate every last bit). good wine list, and a great atmosphere - it's small, there's no intrusive music and a great buzz
5
Haven't been for a while but found this favourite of ours still great. Renovated and Seamus as the new chef.Tiny, cool, interesting tapas near Club Street. No chorizo and croquettes here (thank goodness), but what there is, is an interesting, short, well thought out menu.See current menu in pics. But tonight we loved the bone marrow bruschetta, burrata with pomegranate. The bacon wrapped dates are a must. The lamb tonight was delicious. Friendly service and a cosy feel.We love it. Give it a try

we (group off 4) visited the Moosehead recently for an early dinner which turned out to be a rather late night. And what a night!!!!. Great food and excellent Aussie wines. Share food was in abundance , loved the bacon wrapped dates and the seabass was special . Service was prompt and engaging .Well priced. A nice find by our food connoisseur.Highly recommende

Went here with another couple on a Saturday night and were so pleasantly surprised by the ambiance, food, and service. The food is meant to be shared - bacon-wrapped dates, pumpkin and radish salad, flat iron steak, seabass, all delicious. And make sure that you save room for the Greek donuts for desert! If you like a friendly, casual vibe place you will not be disappointed. We are already looking forward to heading back there
5
We shared lunch sets. Each dish was awesome. yummy roasted cauliflower and lamb shoulder were amazing!
5
Lovely casual atmosphere with simply yummy innovative Mediterranean food. This will be a regular for us for sure
4
Good value, great cozy atmosphere, ordered a dessert which didn't happen and chef offered another dessert on the house (nice touch which we appreciated)
5
Good waitresses. Good food price and drinks. Lunch and dinner different surprises. Will definitely go again.
5
The food was awesome!! A nice place to chill and dine. Portion was a little small but still acceptable, afterall we were very full after finished everything!:) They even gave us sorbet dessert for free! Cant wait for my next round :)
4
Great place for food and to hang out. A little noisy though.
The food was very good. A hint of Australian and Greek. I will definitely come back again.
4
Roasted potatoes were quite magnificent, and wine pairings were good. Sister restaurant Maggie Joan's has food of the same quality with better atmosphere
4
I had agreed to meet my sister and brother in law for lunch but it was already 2 pm so most places were already closing. My brother in law knew this place and had tried calling them but they hadn't answered. Anyway, we took a chance and just went. It was open and they were ready to serve us. This is a small restaurant and they get very busy at lunch and dinner. they served really lovely salads and service was quick. All the food tasted great. Would recommend this place for a very casual meal any time
4
Dates wrapped in bacon for a starter. It worked and presentation and staff was good. Telok Ayer Street is fast becoming a hipster foodie street - with great coffee and a trendy vibe. For a Wednesday lunch it felt like a bit of a treat and it was. The cauliflower dish was great fun to look at, talk about and eat. We were told it was a signature dish which - and it was. For the main courses we had burgers and the pulled pork - good but not as imaginative or fun as the starters. Not hesistation in recommending
5
I've been wanting to go to Moosehead KB for sometime now based on the great looking menu, but was a bit worried we'd be disappointed by portion size, price, noise etc based on some previous reviews.Worries were completely unfounded. From the friendly phone call I received to confirm our reservation to the receiving the bill, which wasn't completely reasonable, my husband and I had a great experience. Food is excellent and the server we had was super friendly (regret not asking her name so could mention her here). We had an early dinner (arrived at 645pm when restaurant was 1/2 full), so noise levels were fine, but it's a small space with bad accoustics, so definitely got noisier as night went on. Maybe this is the only negative point that came true from past reviews I read, but definitely not severe enough to keep us from going back. Definitely recommend
4
Great service. Nice atmosphere. Tasty food. Pity about the portions. Struggled to satisfy the hunger and stay within a reasonable budget.
4
Burratina was too saltyand the sauce for caulifower was salty as well
but the rest was excellent as always:)
5
Great food albeit limited choice, great service and a friendly environment. Definitely going again..
5
I come here regularly because i love it so. Dishes are interesting and executed well with fresh ingredients and of the highest quality. Menu changes every so often so it doesnt get boring. Servers are friendly and restaurant is small with a lively atmosphere.
5
Food is tasty of course, just a little slow to cook the swordfish. Service was slow, staff was a little unattentive. But still, i give 5 stars because not everything will go perfect all the time :)
5
The food is delicious. Some interesting flavours and very fresh. The waitress and chef were very accommodating for my gluten intolerant friend too.
4
I love their bacon wrapped and pork scratching. Strongly recommend the two dishes. Portion are slightly small but quite affordable
4
Was there for dinner on Saturday night - ordered the roast chicken with salsa, grilled swordfish with quinoa & yoghurt and tzatziki with flatbread. Food was good full of flavours, service was very attentive. I would personally have preferred fish to be either barramundi or snapper instead of the swordfish. For desert ordered the sorbet which I felt was too sweet. Overall a 4/5.
4
A regular as its local popped in today and had the lunch menu got the Roast Chicken, Feta and Salad. It was the perfect size well cooked added with a glass of wine in the price altogether a great result. The white wine was particularly good
4
Really enjoyed our past 2 visits to Moosehead Kitchen & Bar. The menu changes regularly, and everything we've had has been delicious! Particularly memorable were the Meze board to start, followed by the burrata, bacon wrapped dates, roasted cauliflower. While cocktails are limited, there is a decent selection of wines and beers. The location is adjacent to the MRT station, making it very convenient. Given their small space though, suggest making a reservation to be sure you can secure a table. However, we didn't have a problem getting in within minutes of calling. The service is hit & miss, but that is expected at many places in Singapore. Definitely recommend giving Moosehead a try
5
Wonderful food, service and ambience. Great location just next to Telok Ayer MRT. Recommend for friends, couples and business.
5
It's very small, but really nice in a very nice area. We just stopped for some drinks and bites to relax from walking through Chinatown.
3
Food = + as unique and interesting
Price = + for food, - for drinks (wines and beer pricy)
Ambiance = + small and good vibe
Service = - bad service
4
Food was very good: beetroot salad and burrata with flat bread were excellent. The mains were very good: perfectly cooked beef short rib and half chicken.
The service was Singapore style - a bit slapdash - but very friendly.
Overall a really enjoyable night.
3
I came in a group of 4, 3 of us had the same food. One like it and 2 don't, so it is subjective.
Overall food choice is not great but the service is very good.
Will come again but not at a high frequency.
5
We tried almost everything in the menuM'y husband, who is in Singapore for 5 years now, says that the lamb ragoÃ»t is the best course he ever had here... And honestly speaking we can only agree with him !All starters and pork belly, beef cheeks, dates with bacon, roasted cauliflower, parsnic puree are really good as well.Everything proposed is really tasty!You feel like in Mediterranean countries as Greece, Marocco..Cherry on the cake: staff is amazing !!!Do not hesitate and RUN
5
Didn't have the opportunity to have food there, only a couple of drinks. The atmosphere is lovely, unique and original. The tables are a bit close from one another but that is due to the very limited space the place has. We enjoyed our service from a smiley waitress, she was accommodating and fast. Would definitely come back to taste the food if I come back to Singapore 
3
I had a casual lunch here with a colleague. We wanted something light so we shared a salad, a mezzo platter and some fries. Overall the meal was fine. The minus however is that it is not fully air conditioned so at lunchtime it can be quite warm inside - not really pleasant. I'd however go again but maybe at dinner time next time
5
This is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Have been there multiple times with friends from out of town, and the food has never disappointed. If you're with just 1 other person, consider sitting by the bar-open kitchen. It is very interesting to watch the chefs at work, putting the delicious tapas together. Everything is delicious to me - except for the pigs ears. (which are OK when warm and crispy, disturbingly chewy when cooled down
4
It is great walking around Singapore and finding great restaurants and Moosehead is one of them. Reasonable priced, small and cozy. I had the Sea Bass which was delicious. It came out before my starter which was a bit odd. I was adventurous with my starter having pigs ears - probably not a good choice for my high cholesterol but very tasty. All accompanied by some great Rioja win
4
But if a hole in the wall but good burger lunch spot. They have a middle Easten sausage thing for lunch big thumbs up. Wine by the glass is a bit exy. It's small so often full.
4
Had a table for 12 - for a friends birthday. Great atmosphere, awesome food, so many sharing plates; so glad we could try so many great bites. Would highly, highly recommend. Good wine pairing too.
5
One of the best meals I've had in Singapore. A lot of care goes into the preparation and presentation of the food which is just delicious. Great friendly atmosphere and staff were excellent. Highly recommend if you have not been!!
4
The food was tasty although the finish could have been slightly better. Average service. Worthwhile checking out though.
4
Hidden gem in Singapore. Moosehead exudes an East Village (New York vibe) - it is cozy and yet lively. One of our friends is a vegetarian and Moosehead had great vegetarian options - grilled eggplant, beetroot salad and miso grilled asparagus. Definitely will visit again!
5
The staff at Moosehead were extremely attentive and engaging. They are clearly passionate about what they do and go to lengths to make sure guests feel welcome and looked after. The food was excellent. The combinations of flavours and textures created delicious, well presented dishes. Sitting at the kitchen bar gave us a great insight into the passion and talent of Chef Dew Wilson, who expertly worked his wood & coal fired oven whilst engaging his clients. I highly recommend Moosehead for your next culinary adventure. 
4
We ordered their pulled pork and cheese burgers and both there delicious, albeit portions are not big. Limited seats so have to share high stool seats with other diners. Slightly understaffed so took a while to hail the waitress who forgot our ketchup the first time
4
What's there not to love about Moosehead? Great food, excellent and warm service, cosy atmosphere... Every friend I have brought here always ends up raving about the superb dining experience.We ordered lots of dishes - the lamb rack special and the sea bass particularly stood out. Even the warm feta bread we started with was a delightful experience. We were disappointed that the sauvignon blanc was out but the recommended semillion was just as good.I will definitely be back
4
If you work in raffles place then this is a great little place to come for lunch (or dinner for that matter). There is both a set lunch or a la carte menu to choose from. The style here is small plate, tapas which is quite common but the food here is of good quality and the price is reasonable. The fish was very tasty and the sides (beets, asparagus, salad ) were all adequate. I ordered from the a la carte menu but the next time I would try the set lunch and try the burger. The wine list is not extensive but has a selection of some Australian wines that won't do too much damage to the wallet. This is good place to come with friends during the monotonous work week or I would think after work for a few drinks or food as it is a stones throw from club street.
3
Was here last night to meet up with an old colleague. We ordered 4 tapas and drinks (no alcohol). The chicken was good but the rest were average. We got the fried feta, bacon-wrapped dates and flank steak. I find the dishes a bit too salty for me, too much soy sauce. Plus the menu selection was limited. It was quite pricey, up to 25 dollars per small plate!!! The ambiance was nice and friendly but the it's very cramped and the stools were mighty uncomfortable. I suppose it's OK if you find yourself in the area but I wouldn't seek it out particularly
5
We needed a break from asían menú and decided to come here. What a good choice! The burger and the bbq pork sándwich were delicious!!! With cider and salad....the fríes were not my favorite.
Small cozy place. Good service. Good value.
4
Great place to meet up for a drink, and nibbles! Friendly staff, good selection of tapas and sharing plates! Relaxed and with a good ambience.
4
Little terrace, little bar, offering excellent food and drinks.
Hand crafted beer Tuatara are on offer, loved the 6 different beers!
5
Great staff, superb food and nice atmosphere... We had all the starters off the menu to share and the seared sea bream, and they where all delicious.
Could do with a better wine list, but highly recommend.
5
Great little boutique restaurant tucked away on Telok Ayer Street. Staff were knowledgeable and friendly and the food was first class. Would highly recommend it for groups or dates
4
First time at Moosehead. It had been recommended by a friend - who was one of the dining party.Quaint and intimate restaurant. Great for groups. Rustic feel to the place. Friendly, approachable, helpful and knowledgeable wait staff, all of whom had a great sense of fun and seemed genuinely enthusiastic about their menu. Which in Singapore, is hard to find!The food we selected - a great menu for a 'tapas style' sharing dinner - was very well cooked and presented, and tasted delicious. Favourites of the night included bacon-wrapped chargrilled dates, and, perhaps surprising us all, deep fried pigs ears!Well worth a visit. It's obvious popularity would make a booking essential on most evenings.Booking for the restaurant's second sitting at 8:30 means that you won't have to leave the table to allow other diners to be seated later
5
Loved my experience... Food was fast and good. Easy menu and reliably delicious. I went with a friend and we shared 5 plates and had an incredible time tasting and talking about the food! Was unexpected but a nice change from pretentious restaurants that over promise and under deliver. It's a casual small restaurant that's not trading off on anything, but a good way to spend an evening with good company.
5
dining out with vegetarians often can be difficult and one might think a place with the name moose head would be one of those. it wasn't. and the vegetarian food was excellent. the charred grilled asparagus being the hit of the evening, two portions. The burrata and tomatoes was also excellent.for the non vegetarians the grilled fish was cooked to perfection.The wine list is interesting with a nice mix.service is a little ad hoc in timing but very good in terms of demeanor.Also be warned it is a barely decorated place and maybe a little noisy for some peopl
3
Hubby and I had dinner at Moosehead on a weeknight. The menu was limited and some dishes were a hit eg. lamb with Israeli cous cous and others missed the mark eg. seabass with eggplant puree (fish was mushy and lacked flavour). The kitchen seemed somewhat chaotic and our first order arrived after 30 mins. No, the joint wasn't full but they seemed to be having problems with their grill or oven.We spent $240 for 2, including a bottle of wine
4
There are so many things to love about this place. 1) The eclectic, grungy Manhattan-style decor; think walls draped with funky murals featuring a Moosehead (duh) in a sea of CCTV motifs, 2) Bold pairing of ingredients. The Chili Pineapple Ice Pop, gula melaka mousse, banana & chocolate was every bit exciting and a total party in the mouth, 3) Minimalistic adornments. Was really impressed by the brilliant execution of simple (read: boring) dishes like Chargrilled Asparagus, which jolts the palate with a piquant miso garlic sauce, and Seabass grilled to a crispy and juicy perfection, simply paired with eggplant caviar that was moist and not mushy.As much as subjective taste buds go, there were of course, hits and misses. While I liked how the tenderness of the Beef tongue slices juxtaposed with crusty Turkish bread, I felt the flavours of the offal were lost in the punchy romesco sauce. Which might just be a good thing for those who dislike offal flavours.
4
Of all the restaurants in the area, this one is outstanding! The collaboration of Moosehead & Bincho worked beautifully.
5
When we initially drove past we were going to skip the restaurant because it was so small. Don't let that put you off. The ambiance of the place was perfect and the food, although simple in conception was just superb. The pigs ears is a must and the pork strips for the main was another sumptuous dish. The staff were attentive but relaxed and we even got a complementary berry pie at the end which was to die for. Thank you. I little gem that I highly recommend. My only concern is that by giving it a good review, we will only find it harder to book in the future.
4
I went to Moosehead with my wife the other night to have a nice birthday celebration over a good meal. I must say that the food was without a doubt one of the best concepts in Singapore! The execution of the dishes was fantastic and the mix of flavors was superb. My only concern was the level of noise. Yes, it is a bar and you must expect some crowd to be over the top of their lungs but I am not sure if it was the acoustic of the room or just normal noise but our birthday celebration needed to start with a bit of screaming to be able to hear ourselves. Despite that fact I will totally recommend this place. Hands down
4
Walked past this place quite late on a Friday night. Was really buzzing. It is small, and only seat was at bar right in from of kitchen. Thankfully aircon took away most of cooking heat. Seems to be type of place you come as a group to just chat the night away. Food is meant to be for sharing. I had pork with a nice sauce. Saw a whole octopus sat in tray which could have fed an army. Anyhow, thought it was a cool place.
4
As long as you book in advance, you are guaranteed to enjoy a great night at Moosehead. The second sitting is at 8.30pm, but we were able to get our table earlier.We started with bread and bacon wrapped dates - sumptuous and melt in the mouth with explosions of flavour.Afterwards we went with a variety of dishes for the 5 of us to share - burratina cheese, iberico ham, grilled asparagus and beet root salads do not explain the myriad of flab ours which we enjoyed!Washed down with a reasonably priced Argentinian Merlot ($69), we had a wonderful evening with good atmosphere, service and great food. This is my third time here in a matter of months and it will not be my last. In a place like Singapore with so many options, this is high praise indeed
4
Having lived in Seville for two years, I am comfortable with eating in small spaces. While this might not suit everyone, I would still recommend Moosehead for its creative tapas, ambient tunes and friendly staff.My husband and I had the dates in bacon (a must!) - the pine nut finish gave this typical tapa a nice little twist. I would also recommend the more unique of the three desserts they offer, which includes flavors of pineapple and gula melaka (coconut sugar).Price-wise, we spent about 100SGD which covered 4 tapas, a dessert, a soft drink and a glass of wine. Not cheap, but not hideously expensive either, especially for Singapore

Telok Ayer may be one of my favorite streets in Singapore, you feel like you’ve stumbled back into Singapore’s history, temples and restored shop-houses mix with an eclectic range of restaurants, while the lights of the CBD blink down from surrounding streets. I’ve been wanting to try Moosehead for a while, but it’s tiny, and popular, hence it’s almost impossible to just walk in and get a table. First tip: make a reservation. My husband was a little underwhelmed by the menu choices (they could probably do a better job of describing each dish) so I did the ordering, and it quickly became one of those fabulous evenings where every dish that came out surpassed our expectations. Bacon wrapped dates; salty, sweet. Divine. Smoky char-grilled asparagus, with just the right amount of biteSlow roasted baby tomatoes with garlicToasted bread brushed with olive oil and balsamicThinly sliced roasted pork, cooked to perfection in a marriage of crispy and tender We both quickly agreed that it made our top ten meals ever. Book a table today. You wont regret it
3
Heard a lot of hype about this place so decided to give it a shot recently. First of all it's small and narrow with inadequate space,a corridor rather than a restaurant space. I noted that in some reviews the buzz word is 'cosy' but frankly thats a misrepresentation.As for 'moosehead' as a name a total mystery except for a bad mural.The lunch menu is too say the least short and confused and if you are not a fan of pork,this is not the place for you with 2/3 of the dishes featuring pork/bacon showing a woeful lack of imagination. The signature dish eg octopus totally absent that day.The menu is very weak with descriptions that are unhelpful When we commented to the waitress that some of us dont eat pork so need alternatives all we got was a shoulder shrug and total indifference so we left
4
What a little find this is! Small, cozy and intimate, but enough space to have a long lunch with the girls and talk about everything! Sensational food, loved the vege options, Burrata, fresh tomato with the best bread I've eaten in years, grilled asparagus with leeks and garlic miso, was yummo! My girls loved the Bacon wrapped dates, roast garlic aioli, pine nuts and the Pulled Pork Burger! And, the chef came and said hello, which is always a winner for me! Well done guys, great experience all round
4
Your Reviewit was my first experience at MooseHead and i was more than happy with the quality of the food we shared as a family to celebrate the Birthday of my house helper. Genuinely tasty and blend very well with the bottle of red Spanish wine they rrecommend. I definitely will come back again. 
3
Cute bar from the outside, just lacking substance and warmth.
Nothing special that would make me come back, and we did not...
Table outside was noisy because of the traffic on Cross road.
5
What a fab place. Great service and excellent quality food. To too it wine is great too. Friendly and efficient service. Will return tomorrow.
5
Loved the food, I loved the pig's ears, and it's my first ears! The Iberico pork was heavenly and so was the roasted cherry tomatoes on vine. And the dates wrapped with bacon... It was like having dessert with breakfast food! yum!
3
This cute little place has great atmosphere but their dinner menu was not impressive. Although the restaurant claims to be Mediterranean, it was more fusion which some asian influence (like their Chicken Bulgogi). Would go back for a bottle of Sauvignon but not for dinner.
4
First time visiting. It is easy to make a reservation. Great interior, feels really cosy and the owners are friendly and warm. Food was great! Definitely worth visiting a second time.
4
The food was phenomenal - it's hard to take away from that but the service was not up to par. Even with a reservation, the table provided was well quite frankly the worst in the place, table service took some time and food items were delayed.Again, I can't take away from the actual food itself - we really enjoyed most of it though the crown jewel should have been the beef cheek and it fell flat. I would go back again with the hope that the service model improves....
4
A tiny restaurant with a creative tapas menu. It's a short menu that changes all the time. Any of the meats are usually great but their salads and veg dishes equally good in my opinion.Best service recovery I've experienced when they clearly stuffed up our reservation last week. The owner personally apologised and served us drinks and food on the house until our table was ready. We've been here many times and will be back
4
Moosehead is a tiny place with a great ambiance (make reservations if you want to guarantee yourself a table). Excellent service, and overall very pleasant. The wine list was great, and the tapas we tried were quite good. I loved the mozzarella one; highly recommended! The smashed eggs were good, but a bit odd, and I was underwhelmed by the bacon-wrapped dates. Be warned, even small plates are fairly expensive
5
We shared clams in flowercrab broth, Iberico & breadcrumbs and we couldn't help but leave the bowl clean!The grilled seabass, anchovy butter, roast eggplant caviar was all that we'd hoped for and more!The lamb rack was perfect, and the maitake mushroom with warm mayo foam, and yuzu dressing was to die for!Casual ambience, great service, and fantastic food!Don't miss it
5
I had dinner at Moosehead for the first time last night and really enjoyed it. The food is meant for sharing and everything we ordered was very good. There were five of us and most plates are portioned into servings of four, so we ordered two of some items. The service was good and the staff was friendly. There are two seating times and we chose the latter and had to wait for our table for about 20 minutes while the previous guests finished their meal. We waited at the bar and had snacks and drinks until our table was ready. Perhaps next time I will go early and book the first seating. I think it would be a good place to go after work for a casual dinner
