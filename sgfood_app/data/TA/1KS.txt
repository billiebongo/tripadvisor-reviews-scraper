Came here recently for a cappuccino after lunch nearby. Coffee took a while to arrive and was luke warm and with a far too milky taste (couldn’t really taste the coffee properly). Probably should have had a double shot, but still. Don’t think I’ll be back

I was surprised when I found that The Daily Roundup has changed to 1KS with a lighter, healthier menu and more of a cafe feel. Breakfasts include granola bowls and açaí bowls, both of which were healthy and very tasty. There are also sandwiches and healthy drinks like the Omega Man with lots of nutrients. Pleasantly surprised

Given that this is an offshoot of Park Bench Deli at telok ayer Street, I had high expectations. But both the food and service here fell short, whether compared to PBD or on its own. While the sandwiches at the first outlet were big and with surprising flavors and textures, the chicken curry sandwich I had here was, let's just say, cafeteria standard. And the portion was small, almost dismal. For $16, I could have gotten a lot more in nearby restaurants. The service? The chef who attended to me ("Ramsay") smiled and made the effort to answer my questions on the menu. His 2 other co-workers seemed more interested in playing with their mobile phones and chatting with each other. When I said "thank you" after one of them served my food, she replied "thank you" while walking and looking away. Maybe I smell and look bad.
