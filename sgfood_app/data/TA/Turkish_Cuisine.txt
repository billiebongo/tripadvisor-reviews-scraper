First time we come to this place but certainly not our last. It was amazing! We ordered some starters followed by a moussaka and lamb kebab. Absolutely delicious. Obviously, the raki is a must as well :)

- Side dish platter for pita bread is amazing, it was better than ordering one by one.
- Pits bread could have been little soft.
-We couldn't try Kunefe, but definitely, will try one day.
-Good ambience for families.

A cozy place for you to enjoy the kunefe. This dessert is the best I have ever taste so far. It is unique dessert to die for. Nice turkish food of course.

We went to this place with friends last night and had a poor experience.. though the name is Turkish cuisine the food doesn't taste close to that... oily food and not value for money.. staff is arrogant and no customer empathy as when we have the feedback on quality of food the answer was " oh is that so .. we have been in business for 9 years.. not sure why you don't like it".First and last visit ....We will never go there again !!

Went there for dinner with hubby, expecting authentic Turkish cuisine in a Turkish ambience But was horrified to find mediocre cuisine served in a run down place by a run of the mill staff.The only thing high was the price.Came back feeling cheated more so since it's highly rated on trip advisorBeware before you go Unless you are happy burning a big whole in your pocket and eating absolutely mediocre cuisine

We choose to have dinner here as it is just 5 minutes from Bayshore where we live. The ambience was good and we got a table in the far end as we requested. We ordered spring roll with feta cheese,hummus and pita for starters and lamb kebab with yogurt for main (all three of us ordered the same). There were two staff, one male and one female, courteous and accommodating. We saw the owner ( or Chef?) sitting in one of the tables and having his dinner. Within a few minutes the restaurant started having more diners and it became quiet busy. The Two staff were running about trying to serve roughly 30 people in the restaurant. We got our starters served about 15 minutes, good taste, hummus was nice but pita bread was served a bit later (fresh and warm). Then we had to wait for another 30 to 40 minutes for the main course. Myself and my Wife even went out for a walk with our 11 month old baby while my Sister was waiting inside in our table. The Indian restaurant next door has a swing outside and we decided to sit there and relax instead of seeing others eating and us waiting.What we noticed was the rest of the tables were served with multiple dishes regularly but ours was not served even though it was the same dish all three of us ordered. In the end it came and we decided to dig in ( imagine how we would have felt after waiting for a Long time). And so we started, before I proceed any further I would like to explain what the dish actually is to readers who may not know. It is a simple dish which has kebabs topped with pita bread and yogurt( simple dish as the kebabs are mostly prepared ready to cook earlier). The yogurt was cold as it should be but the kebab was even colder to my surprise. I called the waitress and asked and she replied it is because of the yogurt. I said it seems the kebab was cooked Long ago or the plate was prepared Long ago before it was served. I didn't want to be fussy so I continued to eat. The waitress told me next time if the food is cold please let us know and we can warm it up. I give 2-3/10 for the kebab. The Turkish coffee was not bad.Overall, if you ask me if I will dine here again, may be not because of the following reasons1) waiting time was really Long2) just two waiters struggling to serve all the patrons3) the boss or the Chef dinning in the main dinning area when the restaurant is getting busy is in my opinion not correct ( it happens in some Arab street restaurants also)4) there are other Turkish or Mediterranean restaurants nearby in the East Coast, if I crave for it( I kind of lost my appetite for it as of now

The meats and salads were average but the dessert was excellent. What prompted the bad review was pretty much being unceremoniously kicked out by the owner. We arrived at 7 and were told that we had till 845, which we thought was plenty of time, but at 8, one of the staff must have realised he made a mistake and told us that the time was actually 8. So after having to rush through our dessert, we asked the server if there was any compensation for cutting our meal short. What we got was the owner coming in personally to tell us that we need to go and presented us with the bill. Average food, good dessert, horrible service and a very bad taste in my mouth after being kicked out for the establishment's error

Came with my wife for date night. Tried the vegetable stew, kibbeh and Ezme as starters. Really like the kibbeh which is about size of a curry puff and filled with minced lamb. Ezme was very refreshing and the halloume was delicious when slightly grilled.Had the has has kebab for mains. Very well marinated and tender.Had turkish coffee, asked for half sweet. Think I should have splurged on the full sugar level. I think it's BYO as I saw some people bringing their own wine. They only have Australian house pour and a premium turkish wine. I tried a glass of the Turkish wine which has good tannins and decent finish and some structure, but lacked fruit. Tried the kunefe dessert. They said it's their best seller and I agree.Yums and will come back again

Pleasantly surprised to find the Turkish restaurant on Upper East Coast Road. Most of them are in Arab Street and around. Dont get fooled by the Ambience.Service - GoodFood - GoodPricing - A Little on the higher side - but again this is Singapore !I would go back

Great Place for A Date. Kebabs and Kunafe was one of the best I had in Singapore. Simply Delicious. Good Service and Staffs were all Friendly. Highly Recommended! The only setback is the parking is rather limited.

We randomly stopped by this place yesterday and wasn't so sure..but I must say..the food is amazing..excellent quality. Will be coming here a lot and highly recommend to anyone. The kebabs, grilled lamb..just so delicious.

We love this place. Great tasting food, nice people, fantastic value. Try this place you will not be disappointed. Oh yes and we have been to Turkey for 5 weeks - loved that to and this reminds us of the great food there.

We always order eggplant dishes, chicken marinated doner kebab here because they are always cooked tasty here. Staff friendly.

My recent trip to singapore i have most delicious Turkish food outside Turkey

My husband & I love coming here to get our full of Turkish food. The owner is Turkish and this unassuming looking place has surprisingly good food. It gets busy sometimes, and sometimes, hardly any people in it. Still, we consistently get good food here. We get excellent service since the staff know us and recognize us every time we come. We quite like that it is not so well known.

I hesitated to review this because I love the quiet ambience and the fact that I can still manage to get a table if I go early enough. But I thought it would be selfish to keep this jewel of Turkish food in the east a secret. This unpretentious restaurant serves delicious Turkish delights. The chicken kebabs are especially tender and juicy. The portions are generous and it would be wise to share. I love especially the hummus and their freshly baked pita bread. But there are simply no words to describe the simply delicious baklava. I have tasted and sampled baklava from different restaurants but the one made by this restaurant has just the right yumminess: the right amount of sweet the right amount of crunch. A must try.

Authentically Turkish with a Turkish owner, this restaurant delivered exactly what I was expecting, along with what I have dearly missed for the 3 years I've been in Singapore! Although it's not your typical centrally-located restaurant, it's well-worth the effort to the hip East.Very healthy portion sizes, great quality food and friendly service - what more do you need?? Teşekkür ederim

I have been dying to find a good Turkish restaurant in Singapore and this is it! The meat was beyond tender, sizing plentiful, staff lovely - owner is authentic Turkish, which is rare...I will go back as soon as I return to Singapore. Can't say enough about the succulent meat or delicious salads! ❤

Considering that I live the other end of the island from this place, its pretty amazing how often I drive there just to have my favourite dessert fix. Plus the mains aren't bad too.Kunefe is not just one of the hardest and most tedious desserts to make, but is also one of the most yummy in my opinion. For mains, try the mousakka if you're a lover of lasagna. Its a comforting mix of potato and eggplant and oh so good. Perfect for my cheat days! Paired with the divinely Turkish apple tea to warm my insides.The service is average but the place is homely. Great for casual meals and chillouts with friends that you aren't afraid of seeing you pig out. Because, eating here, I assure you pigging out is a norm. It's not the cheapest but its not the most pricey. Good value for money

Food and service are excellent! Meat is tender and well cooked with misture of turkish spices. Good treat and varieties available for vegetarians as well, in fact vegetarian tasted very well then non-veg. Kunefe is a must try.

We been to this place twice and the ttried the Pita bread, hummus and Kababs. The food is tasty. The Kunefe desert is a stand-out must try dessert.
Great place to try Turkish Cuisine...reasonably priced
Tried the Kunefe and it was

Excellent Turkish variety of food. Ask for Raki ( Turkish alcoholic drink ) to test with food. Good & prompt service. Good portions of the dish. Better to share. Personalized attentive service.

I was craving for Kunefe so I started searching for the best Kunefe and majority of the reviews stated that Turkish Cuisine serves the best. Hence, I decided to check it out with my wife. We have tried turkish cuisine was in the middle east and in Egypt which was pretty authentic and set the bench mark really high.We ordered falafels with humus and Pita bread, sigara boregi - a pastry filled with fetta cheese and parsley, ayran - yogurt based drink and of course, Kunefe. The falafels were nice but I felt it was excessively coasted with sesame seeds. The sigara boregi filling was tasty but the pastry was too oily. Looks like they use those ready made pastry sheets that they sell at the super market freezer section. The pita bread was huge and thick. Humus was perfect.The Kunefe was generously dusted with pistachios crumble and portion was huge. I found the Kunefe was too buttery that it overpowered the flavour of the whole dessert. I couldn't smell the rose water or taste the cheese but I'm glad that it wasn't too sweet. Certainly, a slice of haven. Overall, the service was good, food was nice and reasonably priced

We've been to this place several times by now,and have tried a number of dishes! They were all unarguably and consistently delicious! For an average price of $20/meal, you get a generous portion of nicely seasoned and well prepared meat with some sort of exotic side (eggplant with yogurt, hummus & bread), all very nicely complementing each other. Highly recommend to try it out

Excellent menu. Although the choices are quite limited, the few that was available met all our cravings. From main to dessert, nothing disappoints. The manager was always cheerful and ready to spring into action at any request. Prices are very reasonable. Portions are huge. Ambience, perfect for all types of visits. In conclusion, we had a great time

My wife and I live around the corner and have been here a few times. We should come more. It's a winner. The starters especially the cacik, ezme and baba ganoush and the bread that they are served on are really tasty. I usually have a cubed lamb kebab and last night's was excellent. Very succulent and perfectly flavoured. The desert we took was a beautiful fried cheese one and is their take on a Turkish classic (apparently). It was worth going for that on its own. You can take your own wine and I recommend avoiding the Turkish beer! The decor isn't great but you don't really notice it. The owner is very nice and the staff are pleasant. A real mixed crowd of clients and we had another great night there.Go

The food is very tasty. The sultans dish, Ali Nazik and adana lamb kebab were very good. And I must say the kunefe is as good as its reputation! Awesome. I will be coming back. It is a bit pricey tho. Especially for being so far out of town. The baklava was a bit too crispy. But all in all, great food!

We pass this place so often on the way to city centre restaurants, but we will do so less frequently in future as we will be stopping off here again.We entered a well lit, pleasant restaurant with lots of Turkish pictures and memorabilia on display. The menu has many standards, but a few different items too. We ordered a kibbeh and an Ezme salad (tomatoes and vegetables in a wonderfully spiced pomegranate sauce). This was followed by a Moussaka which was deeply flavoured if a little oily, and a Sultan's Delight which is a mix of lamb (or beef) cubed with peppers served on a puree of smoked aubergine. Again, well spiced to achieve an excellent depth of flavour.We followed this by sharing a Kunefe, very sweet but light and interesting. You must try this, it is a house speciality.Our bill was a shade over 100 S$ including soft drinks, which we considered good value for the quality of the food and the very pleasant restaurant surroundings

Had dinner at this Turkish restaurant and it was excellent! Very tasty dishes, tasted just like in Turkey. We especially liked the platter with grilled vegetables.Service was very good as well, friendly and efficient.We didn't have dessert but based on the reviews below we will definitely try the Kunefe when we come back
