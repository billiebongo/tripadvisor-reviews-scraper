Good timsum and dishes. Service was attentive but the restaurant was crowded and noisy, reminiscent of the yum cha places if old. Will make another visit for sure
4
Good quality taste dim sum and worth the price.
Ordered a vinegar pork pot, taste authentic and not so oily.
4
For me they have the best roasted pork! We had 3 servings yesterday:) Honey roasted pork is good too. Their custards bun and noddle with mushroom is highly recommended too.
4
The quality of dim sum was good and delicious, as well as having a reasonable wide range for selection. Good place for family dim sum lunch and/or brunch.

Once you sat down and ordered the usual Chinese tea, each person will be charged $2.50/pax for the tea and another $2/pax for a 'package' of wet towel, pickled vegetable and chilli. This is the first time I hear that chilli will be charged in a Chinese restaurant, and if you do not want the wet towel, you can't removed from the bill if you have touched the chilli. Oh my my....

We visited this restaurant with a number of friends for dinner. It seemed an easier solution to choose one of the set menus rather than trying to compile a list of dishes for the table. One of our party does not take meat. On the menu we selected there was a chicken dish. We asked if it was possible for the 1 diner to provide an alternative. There was a very firm no!!!! You have chosen the set menu and that is that. The fact that the menu was charged for 10 diners and there were only 8 of us didn't sway the inflexibility. Singapore has, as you might expect, some excellent restaurants serving Asian dishes. It is also a country where Customer Service is sought and appreciated. We shall not return to the restaurant, which is a shame as the food is usually very good. As the total bill came to around SGD100 per diner it was not cheap. Helping customers with their selections and having some flexibility means the diners will return and the business continues to grow. This seems to be a recipe for decline in buisness

Dim sum is available generally in Singapore but to find one place that does it like HK isn’t easy. East Ocean does it really well, from pan fry carrot cake to roast pork belly, every dish I have tasted so far including dim sum to dinner has been great. A bit pricey but worth a visit.

Have you been seeing cute little animal dumplings pop up on your feed? East Ocean Teochew Restaurant is serving them up a storm ! This is 100% my favourite place for dimsum EVER, anywhere! All ingredients are so fresh and everything is spot on!Crystal Squids flaunt their perfect crystal skin, contain mixed vegetables and every piece of veggie is delightfully crunchy. Little stingrays are stuffed with a deluxe mixture of truffle, prawn and crab meat . I also highly rate the texture and flavour of ha kau's filling, fresh prawns with a bit of a bite , perfectly seasoned with a hint of sesame oil. Even siew mai have a superb balance of pork and prawn, they're moist, well-binded and so satisfying with every mouthful . The highlight of the meal for me is the chicken feet. I love mine spicy, more savoury than sweet, not super soft and these are the perfect feet !!!!! If you have an obsessive personality, you might even develop a foot fetish.East Ocean has proven themselves as not just another gimmick, they clearly know their food and how to 點 people's 心 with it. They've definitely touched ours

Having just arrived in Singapore we wandered towards Orchard Rd and ended up choosing to eat at the East Ocean Restaurant. To make life easier we picked the $55 set menu, hoping to discover new dishes unknown to us. That was a mistake. What followed was a series of average dishes at the very best, served mechanically and too fast.Over the next few days we got to experience far nicer food from other outlets, from expensive restaurants to street food in China Town. All were far nicer.A bad choice we regret.Giving it an average rating to recognise the fact that we were tired after travelling and maybe did not do the restaurant justice.Expensive and underwhelming
3
-I had lunch here with my 2 kids & my sister's family-We had to order 2 servings of the roasted crispy pork 烧肉as it was oh soooo good!-Kids favorite was the roast Duck with noodles & BBQ pork polo buns. -The usual dim sum staples like Siew Mai, har kao are all very tasty
4
We tried their Dim Sum and it was very nice although portion size is bigger in Melbourne.
One of our party had a peanut allergy and when we advised the restaurant they were very helpful in suggesting other alternatives.
4
The place is big for big or small group of people. It is brightly-lit eating place. The foods are good and service are also good.
4
Had an interesting Tim sum brunch as the ladies wanted different experience and tasty food. Judging from the full house audience, It a great food collection plus the friendly staff making it right for all ages.
5
Our weekend brunch place serving consistent quality Teochew cuisine. Look out for the colourful paper on the main board, they are the specials of the day, just like the soy sauce braised duck that was delicious and costs only $16 for half a duck!We will keep coming back here. It is our favourite Chinese restaurant
4
I love pork so we ordered the roasted pork belly and char siew. A bit on the pricey end but worth the wait and totally unforgettable taste. My father like the dessert orhni (yam paste). We were in a rush next time we'll be back for the cute dim sum item
5
We have been to this amazing Teochew restaurant many times. Located at Takashimaya, 5th floor. It have never failed to maintain its clean and authentic food standard. Attentive and warm customer services. Often it will experiment and introduce new Teochew dishes, which tasted great and reasonable prices. Dim Sum are good and cute
3
Third time visiting this restaurant. Interesting Teochew Dim Sum pieces, unlike the typical Cantonese style ones. Teochew crystal dumpling, double faced noodle. Good quality but watch out for all the hidden and mandatory overheads. They charge 5 dollars per head for Chilli and pickles plus Chinese tea, so be prepared to pay close to 15 dollars for each person on top of food bill... probably for special occasions.
4
Although it's at the mall, the meal resembles those of home cooked simplicity and goodness. Good material choices, cooked not too tasty to my liking, and staffs that attend to your need such as replacing dirty plates, refilling tea cups, and they were friendly to my toddler daughter. Ask for their soup of the day, it's worth a try
3
We were taken here on our recent visit as we love dim sum. It was a nice restaurant and the service was very attentive but we thought the quality of the food was only average especially compared to what you can find in a basic dim sum restaurant in HK.Service was much better than HK though with the ladies very friendly and constantly refilling tea.Located in Takashimya - so easy to find
2
We are frequent patrons of this establishment from their original branch in Shaw till they moved to Takashimaya but the standard of the food and service has drastically dropped, it was strange that one of the servers asked us how our food was and when we answered that the fish was left in the steamer for too long / he shot back that it doesn't make a difference how long the fish is cooked. Why ask us if you can accept criticism
4
East Ocean has been around for many many years but the quality of its Teochew style cuisine remains impressive. The cooking style is simple and the ingredients are common but the end products tend to make you want for more.
4
Pomfret pretty good. Some unique delicacies such as pig ears. Set lunches/ dinner pretty alright for price. Taste wise, still prefer their pomfret.
4
I only come to this restaurant during lunch times. Very crowded especially in the week end. But it is worth the wait. A lot of variety of dim sum. Delicious. Food is served quickly. Service is good. Try the chilly prawn.
5
This is a place we often come back to because of its consistency. You need to know what to order because not everything fits everyone's taste. Roast pork was excellent with crunchy skin, soy sauce duck was tender, soy sauce chicken was heavenly, they might have specials on meat every weekend so ask the staff. Porridge is also very good, pomfret Teochew style our Favourite. Note that they have both Teochew and Cantonese style porridge options so you need to state your preference. They serve traditional kungfu tea at the start and end, so if they don't please ask for it too. You don't have to spend a lot to have a delicious meal in this restaurant.
5
We visited this restaurant twice. Once with some friends before the Chinese New Year Celebrations and afterwards with some members of the Singapore family. Both times the welcome and service were excellent. There is a very full menu but as the name would suggest there is an emphasis on seafood. The restaurant is always very full, in our experience, so making a booking seems to be a requirement unless you are willing to queue. The food was excellently prepared and presented. The staff were incredibly efficient and friendly. It is a favourite venue for some of our friends and we can certainly understand why. It's central Orchard Road location makes it an easy restaurant to find and visit.
4
1st experience i think shouldn't choose CNY period as everything on the menu seems quite expensive. The dim sum priced $8.8++ for all. It is CNY special dim sum which is not the normal that you see elsewhere. They did use premium ingredients and that marked up the price. We ordered the 3 types of roasted meat and I like the roasted pork a lot, it is really good and the skin is so crispy. The food generally quite nice but it is so pity that they din serve orni during CNY period. That is one of the reason that I come to the restaurant
3
Until Imperial Treasure Fine Teochew on Level 4 recently closed to make room for Kinokuniya, there were two Teochew restaurants at Ngee Ann City . ImpTreas had lots of Cantonese dishes/influence but was much more refined; East Ocean is more authentic and more 'peasant' so to speak. It commands a very loyal following, judging by the large, full 'waiting room' at lunch time on weekends. Excellent service from a pro-active and efficient staff
4
It is always very crowded and popular. Better go with a booking and be on time otherwise the reservation will expire.Dim Sum is good, but not excellent and you don't need to try very hard finding a better one. A bit disappointed given its reputation.For example, Har Kau is not juicy though the shrimp is big. Anyway a safe choice with not bad taste
5
If you love dimsum, you will definitely like the food here. Surprisingly, price is not over the top. I recommend the lobster noodle, which is around $23. Make sure you make a reservation first. Had to wait more than 30 mins. Service is fast as well
4
My family has been patronizing this restaurant for more than two decades, since it started out at Shaw Centre. It's plump and succulent Siew Mai (烧卖) and ha gao (虾饺) are still the best around! The old style Teochew porridge with dried oysters, fish or fresh pomfret are also very good. My other personal favorites are almond prawn (凤尾虾), yam spring roll, fried pi pa tofu
4
We were here for business lunch. Being a vegan, I too enjoyed their veg dimsums and tofu-veg. They serve Flower herbal teas, very nice! Recommended Place.
3
Tofu and crab with rice vermicelli were good, but steamed Soon Hock HK.Style was too salty. Crispy salted chicken was very touch also. Water costs $1 / glass.
4
A great dim sum place. Do make reservation in advance for weekend. Recommend to take the first seating, second seating doesn't guarantee you to be seated on time, end up waited additional almost 1 hour for second seating. The dim sum & roasted pork (do reserve a portion when making your reservation as it do run out fast) here deserve a thumb up. However, don't need to waste your stomach space those those cute dim sum which we invested on (photos attached). There were cute but taste wise, better to order the usual dun sum dishes instead.
5
I have been coming to East Ocean since it was at Lido Shaw Centre. It's my favourite "yum-cha" or dim-sum place for the Hong Kong weekend brunch atmosphere - but they have since stopped the table service of dishes... SIGH! Nevertheless the food is still great. YUM-CHA SPECIALTIES: Char-Siew Bun, Steamed Radish Cake, Harm-Swee Kok (sorry, no English translation for this!) and Lau-Sar-Pau (Custard Bun with Salted Egg Yolk). DINNER SPECIALTIES: Braised Lobster Noodles, Superior Shark's Fin Soup, Roast Pork Belly and 3-Egg-Spinach Soup.ADVICE: Don't bother to make reservations for the weekend Yum Cha - go early before 11AM... I am usually there before 10:30AM
4
Came for dim sum lunch with the family, enjoyed all of the offerings but have to say that the custard buns were the most well received on the table. We order three rounds! Will be back, come early or face a minimum waiting time of 45 minutes during the weeken
4
Situated on the fifth level of the sprawling Ngee An City shopping complex,a good respite from the maddening shopping crowd floors below. A decent selection of dim sum during lunch hour, plus ala carte. What we ordered(shrimp dumplings,siewmai,beancurd sheet and shrimp paste,egg tarts,glutinous rice in lotus leaf etc)were yummy. Prices are a tad higher than comparable restaurants. Service is swift and efficient. Ambience wise,better than your average noisy Chinese restaurants clatter. They also have an extensive wine collection. I spotted several bottles of Chateau Haut Brion at $1700 a pop......
3
Think the pricing during CNY is jacked up too high for this otherwise reasonably priced restaurant. Also the Dim Sum menu offered is limited with 10 variety and in my opinion it's skewed towards making its customers spend more. Hence do avoid dining at this restaurant during festive period. Nonetheless food wise, the poached prawns are indeed fresh which goes very well with the black soya sauce. Children enjoyed the beef and braised Ee fu noodles
5
I was there for Dim Sum Brunch on a Saturday Morning (11am) and it was really crowded. Reservations are highly recommended. We got a table thankfully as there was only 2 of us. The Dim Sum choices were sufficient although not extensive. We had about 10 different dishes including desserts and they were all good. The bill came up to about $90 for the both of us but it was very worth it for the quality and also amount of food. Some of the Dim Sum are actually comparable to hotel standards. Interestingly, there isn't much Teochew Dim Sum or dishes although it is a Teochew restaurant. The selections are very much commercial with the popular Dim Sum selections, so there is something for everyone. A 5 star rating as it is place that I would go back again with my friends. Please manage your expectations for their service as it is more prompt than friendly. Servers are all running around and you will really need to catch them to receive some sort of service
4
Paradoxically this Teochew restaurant serves some really lovely dim sum that can rival the new kids on the block. Go for the steamed radish cake instead of the usual fried version. The chee cheong fun was nice but the sauce a little too sweet. While pricey, I thought it well worth the price. Order the fragrant glutinous rice steamed in lotus leaf and vinegar trotters
4
Our Singaporean friend booked us lunch at this place. Booking is very much advisable since this place has very high traffic even on a weekday, unless you don't mind to wait for 15-20 minutes.The signature and most recommended dishes here are Roasted Pork and Roasted Duck but unfortunately the Roasted Pork sold out (and it was only 2PM). I am not a fan of duck but their Roasted Duck was simply delicious! Skin was thin and crisp, the meat did not have this peculiar smell of the usual duck meat, of which I was amazed. The accompaniment dipping sauce was sweet, sour and tangy, perfectly complemented the dish.We had dimsum as well, the siumay was OK, but the steamed pork ribs was very juicy. Price range is expected due to its location but worth the quality and taste. Would definitely love to come back to have their Roasted Pork.
3
Another alternative place for Chinese Food in Town
Average food with average pricing.
Staff is okay only.
5
Definitely the best Dimsum in Singapore in my opinion....a lil bit on the pricey side but would recommend anyone to try it...
Always full on weekends so make sure to book in advance!
4
Quite costly but we love the dim sum here. Very close to HK and Msia dim sum taste and quality. Service staff are attentive and offers good service. Reservations are allowed on weekends but do book in advance.
4
Food is good and tasteful with less salt. Vegetables and meat are not over cooked. Service is good with good attention to change plates from time to time. I will go again next time to Singapore.
2
My family of five went to their Takashimaya outlet for lunch on 28/12/15. We ordered based on the menu provided but when the bill came, I was shocked to see that the prices charged were much higher than what was stated in the menu. I asked why and they say they gave us bigger portion. Why the restaurant don't have any ethics in asking us in the first place? Is this the way the restaurant make profit
3
As a frequent customer even since they were at Shaw Centre, this has to be the most disappointing visit to East Ocean. From the start, service was utterly horrible, and we had to raise our voices just to be heard to place our orders (yes we do speak the local language as well). As for the food, dim sum was a mere disappointment. With the price paid, you're better off going to more well known dim sum joints such as wah lok. The teo Chew duck was however, delicious and I was glad they were able to maintain its deliciousness. All in all, this place may have lived past its glory and perhaps a better option would be Imperial treasures teo Chew restaurant which is just 1 floor below this place.
1
Food is very average. I doubt they are cooked by a real chef. Probably someone who used to cook Zhi char are some hawker centre. Very disappointing especially when you compare with what they can cook in the past. Very obvious the old chefs have gone
3
Saturday lunch here. Had to wait a bit and urge the receptionist that I had my aged mom to care for despite our reservations. The typical Teochew fare including the stewed duck (goose was not even in the menu) was not great, and their special sharks-fin was quite disappointing. The bright spot was the dim sum. All in all, we had a good family get together but I doubt we will return soon.
5
We had one of the tastiest dim sums, which included BBQ Pork Pie (char siew sou), Siew Mai, Har Kau, Chee Cheong Fun (with char siew fillings), Carrot Cake and BBQ Pork Pun (char siew bao). Despite the large number of people waiting for their tables, we got ours pretty fast as we had booked in advance (strongly advise anyone who is planning to dine there to do the same). Service was good. If you are looking for delicious dim sum, this is the place to go. As a matter of fact, we are already making plans to go for another round soon
5
We went there for yumcha and we were satisfied with the food and the services. We only waited 5 mins for a table for three. Prompt services once we have a table, one dedicated waiter looking after our table (he needs to look after a handful of tables but he's very quick and thoughtful, for example, he brought an extra chair for my hand bag and gave a pencil and paper for my son to draw). The kids menu has lots of animal looking food dish that all kids would love to eat them all
3
Somehow the taste of the food items is slightly different from the shaw tower's old place. The har kao & egg tart was good. Steam carrot cake was too soft and salty. The teochew fish porridge was tasty.
5
East ocean serves authentic chinese food, both simple dim sum and high end delicacies. Pomfret fish porridge is great!
3
Knew the original restaurant which was located at Shaw House many many years ago. Now located at Ngee Ann City, the Chefs have changed and so is the menu. Tried some of the signature dishes and realized the changes in tastes and presentation. One of the Signature dish called Double Side Yellow Noodle was not well prepared as it was burnt on one side instead golden yellow. it was too oily too. The Silver fish was okay, the sliced smoke duck and the stir fried scallops with egg were a disappointment. The Swatow style cod fish was okay. The vegetarian dish of Tofu with seaweed was good. Overall, the dishes were average compared to the heydays of the past. The Captain Raymond Ho was the only Star of the night. Very helpful, knowledgeable and a pleasant person
5
Famous old teochew Chinese restaurant in Singapore. Newly located in the 5th floor of takashimaya shopping mall in the heart of orchard road. My favorite dishes are dim sums such as roast pork, deep fried silver fish, Peking duck, daily soup, hot stone sharks fin, fried rice with vegetable and many others. Weekends lunch pls book in advance as it's always long waiting tim
4
I ate here last Sunday with my mom, since she only wanted to eat a simple dish. We both ordered 1 teochew fish porridges and it turned out we loved it so much, so we ordered one more serving. It was basically steamed rices poured over a hot soup, containing sliced pomfret fish, squids, mushrooms, dried salted fish and bits of everything that you can think of to make it a wonderful dish. The dou miau was cooked well too. To finish the meal, we ordered its yam dessert with gingko nuts. It was very good. It was as good as the one I had in Hong Kong. I would recommend this restaurant if you are bored to eat at the food court and don't mind to pay a bit for a restaurant quality food
4
East Ocean is fast becoming a favourite restaurant of mine. The food quality is good and service is prompt. It reminds me of dining in Hong Kong actually with decor and food. Dim sum is above average and a constant favourite is the XO sauce squid. The roast pork is not as fantastic as its made out to be. I have had better. While the skin is crispy, there is just something a little lacking. And... after a few pieces, you wouldn't want to touch it anymore. Too oily and fatty. The steam pork ribs are a tad bland and is likely frozen pork. The regular dishes such as sweet and sour pork, etc are done well. Have been coming back for lunch and dinner and enjoy the experience every time
3
Made a reservation for 26 Dec 14 6pm as I was afraid of long waiting queues, but apparently it was not that busy. I was expecting more selection of dim sum but only a few items (less than 10 selection of dimsum) was available, one of which is the infamous 'liu sha bao'. The size of the bao is small, like a typical 'lian rong bao' and it was good. We also ordered a stir fry noodle, a combination of roast pork and duck, softshell crab with mango salad, claypot fish maw and tofu, kailan with garlic and oyster congee. The bill was $171.00 (all taxes in ). It was our first time trying the food and I would say, the food taste ok and I would expect it to be better for that price. Nonetheless, we did enjoyed the dinner and would we return? Maybe for the dimsu
2
return back towel but service lady said still charge $1.39+svc+GST coz towel, pickles & chilli charg togetherto my surprise, dim sun restaurant charge for chilli which go with din sum? service lady answe red yes different restaurant has different policy charges (day light robbery style)another server said it company policy he can't s anything but charge us or towel though we don't usebad poor horrible attitude style restauran
4
I frequently visit this restaurant most of the Sundays. Their Sunday Dim Sum starts from 10am onwards. Their Custard Egg bun is very delicious. The filling inside is very full, taste wise is very fragrance and sweet. Their 'tau Kee' is also very delicious. Their Lobster Porridge is very nice too as the ingredients is very fresh. They also serve small glass of thick Pu Er tea as to clear our stomach before our meal. Expect to wait for a while as it is quite crowded on weekends. A great place for family gathering
3
Still would rate them as one of the best dim sum restaurant in Singapore. But my last visit was forgettable, poor communicatiom from reservation and equally poor service during dining.Pricy to an extend comes with quality food. Ala carte menu has good variety but not as fantastic. Recommend for tge dim sum
4
We enjoyed the style of chinese , as good as anything in hong kong , the prices were reasonable , excellent staff , reccomended .
3
Went there on Sunday, the crowed was terrible having to wait 20 mins despite booking. Food was very typical Teochew however I have eaten better teochew food elsewhere.
5
We took our Australian visitors here this week for yet another wonderful meal. The quality of the food and service here is always up to a very high standard. The Peking Duck is a regular on our menu as is the Eggplant Claypot. We have been slowly been working through there menu and have never had a dish we are not happy with. The service is outstanding. It can get quite busy but not too bad during the week. This is what I would call a mid to high price range Restaurant, depending on what you order. The Peking Duck is very good value! If you are going to have wine expect the bill to go through the roof!! I can highly recommend this Restaurant
3
They had moved from Shaw Centre to Ngee Ann City last year, and the place is chockablock with dinners and service runners. Popular, nosy, stressful and functional.We spent S$553 for Chinese New year Lunch for four, an ordinary lunch in a small dinning room where most service personnel walked pass without entering. The 'Teochew Yusheng' (raw fish salad) $88++ is probably the most expensive salad that we Chinese eat during the 14 days of New year. The $368 set lunch featured steamed fish, roasted chicken, mushroom stewed pot, glutinous rice and new year cake. All mass produced and pre-cooked dishes to meet the high demand of the new year crowd, the peak of the eating seasons. Despite the 'fast food' style menu, there were long waits between the dishes, overall it took more than 2 hours for the food to arrived - a forgettable experience. Next year, I would avoid Chinese resturant during the Chinese New Year period
2
Food standard has gone down since its days in Shaw building.. Service has also taken a beating with relatively new faces on board! Kept asking same questions on our preference with the food from numerous staffs within a few minutes. Forgotten our orders despite repeating it. Service attitude was poor. Please reconsider before booking!
3
Paid $1600 for CNY dinner for 10 but food was really a letdown. None of the guests thought its worth the price at all. Definitely nothing Teochew about the taste nor the preparation of food. Service was good despite full house so that's the reason for 3 star rating.I guess only the dimsum lunch is worth the visit
5
I've eaten several times at East Ocean Teochow and always found their Yum Cha to be of the highest quality. There's more room and less noise now that they've relocated so it's now a much more pleasant place to dine. Service is prompt albeit a little disinterested - acceptable given it's Yum Cha and that they're very popular.Their crispy roast pork is exceptionally good and their prawn dumplings delicious.Be hard to find much better Yum Cha anywhere
4
With all the new age fusion restaurants and cafes around town, its good to rediscover good sturdy chinese food again, especially in the Teochew style. Food is not necessarily cheap here, it depends on what you order. It is always tasty!Going in a larger group, anything from 6 persons, allows one to sample more dishes, as with all Chinese restaurants.We always order the East Ocean Seafood Claypot. Its a hefty $38, but its worth it, as there are so many delectable morsels in this dish;)We also like the Roast Pork Cubes, served with mustard. Advance orders for this might be necessary on weekends, an extremely popular item!This last trip, we were recommended scallops steamed on top of tofu. It was a delicate dish and quite delicious. Teochew style yam and gingko nut dessert is always our favourite way to end off the meal. Its sticky, its sweet and sinful, but what a way to end the meal!Service is with good intention, but staff tend to get sometimes forgetful. Just call one more time, they are quite pleasant overallWorth a visit. If you dont like the crowds, do try to make it there on a Weekda
4
Their choices of the dim sum is nice n smooth. Their unique n cute version dim sum is cute but the taste need to improve... Over all it's just a normal dim sum but worth of it. I went on weekend, it's a lot of people n need to q. Go early ...
4
The last time I visited was still the old location (can't get up early enough on the weekends hehe) Visited last weekend, in the new location. Food is still good. Special Mention: Tasty Siew Mai, substantial, transluscent Ha Kaw that's a great mouthful, Prawn Chee Chong Fan is a delight, Chicken Feet is tasty but most of all the CUSTARD BUN - warm egg yolk, butter, cream explodes in your mouth. 1 is not enough but alas! the calories! Definitely recommend the Weekend Dim Sum. MRT: Orchard Station. Level 5 Ngee Ann City Shopping Centre. Come before 11am to avoid a seriously long wait
4
We enjoyed the place, and the food.
Even the most simple dishess were very tasty.
They have big sellection of see food and also vines.
The restaurant is located at Takashimaya Department Store at Ngee Ann City (5th Floor) along the Orchard Road.
4
Unusual dim sum offerings (the other dishes are also good, although below the best). Attentive service by keen staff.
4
The first impression was the greeting by staffs and attentiveness of all. This chinese dishes is a Teo Chew style and we love it. The ducks, the chicken, the roast crispy pork, the fish, the meat, the veggies or even Chinese whiskey and tea. we loves every minutes. if you are fancy on chinese food, try this place in Singapore. It's on Orchard Road

For full reviews visit my blog at www.ms-skinnyfat.comYou MUST order the mini egg tarts ($5.80 for 4). One is not enough for anyone i swear. The light and flaky puff pastry carefully held the wobbly golden custard which was like an egg cream. I'm drooling at the thought of it now..I swear by anything that has shrimps in them. Every prawn dish that we tasted were fabulous owing to the fresh and succulent seafood. Just look at those Har Gows ($6 per basket).I love the thin and springy steamed rice rolls and the shrimp ($5.80) and scallop ($6) ones were stellar. Definitely value for money given the size of the prawns! 3 rolls with 3 prawns in each of them.Another variation of prawn dim sum- The Deep Fried Beancurd Skin Prawn Roll ($5.80). If you want the healthier option, there is also the steamed version of this for the same price and we ordered that as well! Heh. Ordered some Century Egg Porridge for sharing. Don't you love congee? Each bowl had chunks of century egg in them.The pork dishes weren't that great as compared to the prawn ones. It's not that they weren't good, they were just not that great in comparison. I was really looking forward to the Baked BBQ Pork Bun ($6 for 3) but was sorely disappointed. Imperial Treasures Bakery sells better buns that you can take away for cheaper. The pork was weirdly savory with onions in them that weren't caramelized enough. The milky bo lo bao crust was alright but at some parts the bun to meat ratio was too much. I also found some parts of the bun a little hard and crusty in the stale way.The highlight of the meal was supposed to be the steamed Custard Bun ($5 for 4). I was looking forward to ending lunch on a high and sweet note but....I didn't like the salted egg yolk custard because it was WAAAAAAAAAY too sweet!While there was a good bun to filling ratio in this one and i liked the dense texture of the steamed bun, the sweetness was an overkill. Will not order this again. :(There were more dishes that we ordered but i think this is kinda sufficient to make up your mind on dining at East Ocean Restaurant. I sure wouldn't mind going back considering the good price point and high quality of the dishes. The final bill came up to $24 per pax inclusive of GST and service charge. Not bad hur! Something to keep in mind when you're in town

Today,I have visited the East Ocean Restaurant for dinner with my family. The food court or a hawker centre provides a better service than this so-called high class restaurant. I asked for some cut chilli but was turned down by the staff because i have rejected the extra cost of the pickles and towels. What is the cost of some cut chilli as compared to the cost i have paid for the dinner? I feel that it was ridicules as we had to pay for the extra charges in order to get simple cut chilli. As such, i feel that for my next time i should buy a pack of chilli from the nearby cold storage and request the staff to cut it as i am paying them the service charge. Since they could not even provide with such request, I feel that this place should be renamed to "East Ocean Teochew Fast Food Outlet " instead of a status of a "Restaurant". What a shame! Mr Sea
3
The restaurant can get too crowded during lunch time at weekends. I suggest it has a queue chit number for customer instead of calling individaul customer name when their table is ready for them. The char siew bun is nice. Siew mai and panfried carrot cake too. I ordered a lime juice and was surprised to find it dear at a price of $7/glass with small portion amount

My last visit to East Ocean was a couple of years back when it was still located at Shaw Centre. It is now relocated to Ngee Ann City. While nostalgic patrons like myself would miss the cozy ambiance of the former location, the disappointment really lies in:1) Quality of food (which is mediocre at best)2) Price (upmarket pricing with average standards)3) Service (attending waitress ignorant of the names of dish and insisted that a certain dish had already been served, pointing to another dish on the table)I am not sure if the service staff are on contract. There were attempts to salvage the stubborn insistence of the erroneous waitress with more regular top up of the tea, but the abysmal standard goes beyond that. Pictures of food in the menu looking totally different (and I am not being fussy here) from the actual one (uncooked mushroom shown in the menu, but overly cooked in reality, priced ridiculously).My family and myself would surely be staying away from East Ocean for a very long time

Just went for a family lunch today and was eagerly anticipating the meal after a long break from the restaurant. Alas, while the standard of food has remained high - from the classic braised goose/duck and cold crab to dimsums of all types including the cute animal shaped ones - we loved them all; the environment has become overly noisy to be considered ideal. Granted that some noise adds to the vibrancy of a dimsum restaurant, but too much of it makes one feel a bit short-changed especially as prices are not low by any standard. Another disappointment was the lacklustre list of desserts available - classic orn nee and cheng tng are not available for lunch. I have to compliment the service staff for being extremely courteous and efficient amidst all this. In fact my email booking elicited a confirmation within the hour and we were seated within 10 minutes of arrival. Despite the good food and service, the noisy environment is enough to put me off going there again anytime soon

As a ex sydneysider i thought this may be related to the popular East Ocean in Sydney's chinatown but no, both do good dim sum, have common name but are not related. This restaurant has branches in guang dong and HK so i reckon the owners would likely introduce tested repertiore here to ensure uniqueness.Come here for good dim sum/yum cha and even a lar but if you are in a large group, book a room for your function otherwise eat and go as it could be pretty noisy to have business conversations.Enjoy and let us know what the ups and downs are

I was a regular at the old place before they moved to Ngee Ann City. The queue had always been the same and always long. I visited this restaurant to entertain an guest from overseas and he absolutely loved it. The bamboo cockle is really great. We also had crispy pork, pecking duck and crab sharkfin soup. As most visitors would visit only up to level four of Ngee Ann City because all the stores for shopping is level three and below; East Ocean Teochew Restaurant is located on the fifth floor. Don't miss it

Love the creative dim sum creations!

The food was out of this world. We splurged and I ended up buying the most expensive lunch in my life - $ S 472 for 2 of us - without any drinks. A "Blue Moon" experience that was worth every cent in the food sense. I was a little disappointed with the crowded and noisy restaurant environment though. It was almost like eating in a Food Hall. Service was great - to be expected when you opt for the menu option we did

We had an excellent dinner here on Monday 12th Nov 2012. Its is certainly one of the best teow chew restaurants I have been to. The double boil soup was awesome. The crab roe sharksfin soup was good too. We had lemon chicken, thai style garoupa, asparagus with scallops and awesome yam paste dessert. Loved the food and the service was superb

I will definitely bring my VIP to this restaurant if time is permitted. Must make a reservation or else it's at least 30min waiting time on weekday. They just moved from Shaw House to Takashimaya, with bigger place and more comfortable dining area. Must, must must try their dim sum. Personal favorite is the chicken claws, egg tarts and salted egg York bun. If you have children guests, then the cartoon dim sum is perfect for them. Very innovative ideas on traditional food, that will definitely make choosy children finish the food on their plates. I believe during the weekend, they serve special food such as braised goose (authentic teochew cuisine, only skilled Chef can cook this). Order a pot of tea to go with your dim sum, and do not miss their dessert. They serve good selection of traditional and fusion desserts. After the dessert, they will serve complimentary gong-fu tea to clean your palate

Since moving to Ngee Ann City, the dining experience at East Ocean has improved greatly. The long dim sum menu has unusual dishes, like intestines cooked in different ways, etc. The service is very attentive, better than at the competition in the same shopping mall. The people handling telephone reservations, however, are still the same - quite rude

This is one of my favourite Dim Sum but the queuing part is a kill. We did a reservation at 1pm but we got wait for about 45mins for our turn. This restaurant is well liked by most of the age group, like my mum who is at 65 enjoy most of it. And this time round they have launch animal Dim Sum series which caught my eyes. A few Dim Sum not to be missed is the custard bun, har kou, steamed rice rolls, crispy fish skin, beancurd skin, BBQ pork bao and the animal series like Ugly Ducking which come with duck meat with yam paste, Oinklet with veggies or Chick chics with hams & veggie

This used to be my choice dim sum venue on Sundays. The dim sum was reasonably priced so we do not mind the long queues. The usual wait time is approximately 20 minutes, despite having made reservations. Walk-in customers will have to wait for 20-30 minutes.The price had been steadily increasing over time, to the point that it's no longer good value for money. In addition, the serving portion for certain dishes had become smaller. The service is fast and the waitresses will efficiently clear the table almost as soon as a dish is consumed. The meals felt hurried as the restaurant is always packed, and the queue does not seem to shorten despite the rapid table turnover.Tables are too close to each other and recently, new tables are set up at the walkway leading to the lifts behind the restaurant. The overcrowding and high level of noise diminishes the dining experience. This restaurant has to seriously consider expansion plans.Meanwhile, I have found alternative dim sum venues. I would still return to East Ocean once in a while as the food quality is still pretty good

Reserved and waited around 5 min before being shown to a table. Waiters and waitresses are extremely attentive and considerate to our every need. Food-wise, we (Hubbs and I and our 2 kids, a 8-year old and a 2-year old) went owing to the animal dim sum variety they offer, to delight our kids. Hubbs had fried noodles, hong kong style porridge and stir fried rice rolls, all great! Ordered the typical dim sum items such as siew mai, har kou, steamed rice rolls, pan fried carrot cake, steamed barbeque pork buns, chicken feet (ironically, our 8-year-old son's favourite - we didn't dare to eat that!), deep fried cuttlefish and pan fried prawns in beancurd skin. The pan fried and deep fried items were good, but the siew mai and har kou were a miss. The brunch set us back S$120 (incl service charge) and we gave another S$5 as tips. We would go again, for the excellent service we had enjoyed. In terms of the food itself, we believe the restaurant is famous for the teochew dishes, and not so much the dim sum though. We prefer Crystal Jade which we frequent =

First time here, just ask the waitress what to order, get my self chicken and fish in a pot. With crispy fish skin for appetizer. Overall the taste is good. Clasic. I miss this kind of food style. Very diffrent with the new neo chinese that is grooming in big city

Was taken here for dim sum but even with a reservation we were left waiting for almost 30 mins. Food was bland and over cooked. The service and atmosphere was lacking. In a town with plenty of dim sum choice they need to do much better

Costly but tasty

One of the better dimsum place.

An alternative to Red Star if you're into dim sum. Red Star is more Hong Kong-ish with the food being pushed ard in trolleys. But East Ocean has more variety of food.

Disappointing

This place although small and usually packed to the brim particularly sunday, serves the dim sum in the old Hong Kong Style where you got waitress pushing or carrying carts with dim sum on it going around and shouting out what they have.
